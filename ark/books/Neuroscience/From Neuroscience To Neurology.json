The “impossible” had become possible. This book focuses on the remarkable transformation that has occurred within neurology, a transformation from the “impossible” to the possible. Twenty-five years ago computed tomography had just become available and was rapidly evolving, but magnetic resonance imaging was not yet feasible in the clinical realm. Medical students at some institutions were taught to try not to make the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis early in its course, since there was little that could be done. Some senior neurologists—good clinicians—made the diagnosis of MS and then walked away from the bed- side, since there was little to offer in the way of effective therapy. Peripheral neuropathies were regarded as untreatable. Strokes were treated with bed rest, and not much else. Now, only a few decades later, we have access to imag- ing techniques that portray the brain and spinal cord— noninvasively—in elegant detail. There are five approved drugs for MS, which favorably modify its course. Plasma exchange is routinely and effectively used to treat Guillain-Barré syndrome. Strokes are prevented by aggressive diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, and are sometimes reversed with thrombolysis. These changes in our therapeutic armamentarium are only the tip of an iceberg. New and more effective treatments for Parkinson’s disease, migraine, spasticity, and dystonia at all at hand, and there is more to come. The goal of this book is to capture the trajectory, and the creative processes, underlying the revolution that is going on in neurology. This book, rather than being a compendium of neurological therapeutics or of recent advances in neuroscience, tells the stories of how neuro- logical therapeutics were developed—or are being devel- oped . The first part of this book reviews the development of new therapies in neurology, from their inception in terms of basic science to their introduction into the clin- ical world. Within the first section, authors address the questions: How has the revolution in neurology occurred? What lessons can we learn from past successes? Can these lessons help us to ensure progress in the future? The second part of this volume explores evolving themes and new technologies. Changes in the practice of neurology have been driven by advances in the laboratory. But, in paral- lel with the transformation of clinical neurology, neuro- science and molecular medicine are moving forward rapidly and are generating new information and perspec- tives at an ever-increasing rate. The chapters in the sec- ond part of the book explore rapidly-advancing areas of research which may hold the key to still other therapeu- tic advances. Hopefully these chapters will provide a roadmap for the future. Who knows what neurology will be like twenty-five years from now? There will undoubtedly be additional, and very powerful, diagnostic methods. And there will almost certainly be new, and more effective, therapies for patients with disorders of the nervous system. Some of these advances will be outgrowths of research that is ongoing at this time, while others may come from advances that have not yet been imagined. We cannot know for sure, at this time, which diseases of the nervous system will be cured, and which symptoms will be totally alleviated in two decades. We can, however, predict with a high degree of certainty that, as each year passes, the therapeutic transformation of neurology will continue so that, in each new decade, an increasing number of neurological disorders will yield to therapy. That is almost a certainty. And it is to that goal that this book is dedicated.

The Swedish Academy said the discoveries of American Paul C. Lauterbur and Briton Sir Peter Mansfield represent “a break- through in medical diagnostics and research.” The last time the medicine prize was awarded in the field of diagnostics was for the development of computer assisted tomography in 1979. (See Figure 1.1.) The last, but most important, step for a new technol- ogy is its establishment in clinical practice. The evolution from tentative reports and early research activity to the definition of possible clinical benefits and acceptance into practice (Jackson, 2001) is often protracted in com- plex technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Lauterbur (1973) published his landmark article about the derivation of position-dependent information by nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic gradients in the early 1970s. Despite the work that followed by Sir Peter Mansfield (Mansfield and Maudsley, 1976, 1977) and other groups, the first clinical MRI system was not available until 1984 followed in 1987 by the first para- magnetic MRI contrast agent. The last 20 years have realized several advances in computer technology and software development, and these changes have continu- ously improved the accessibility and quality of MRI. The earliest scans—T2-weighted, T1-weighted, and (proton density) PD-weighted sequence without contrast—took hours to complete. Today, multiparametric protocols can assess within 15 minutes the most complex pathophysio- logical processes, which has allowed a dramatic shift in the evaluation and treatment of neurological illness. As the clinical discipline of neurology has evolved from a diagnostic to a therapeutic specialty, MRI is being trans- formed into a clinical tool that has an impact on neurol- ogy at the bedside. This chapter illustrates this transformation through three classical neurological dis- eases that have gained growing interest with regard to therapeutic options only within the last 30 years: acute ischemic stroke, multiple sclerosis, and brain tumors. It is exciting to observe that, with an increasing number of clinical therapeutic trials being designed, MRI may not only function as a diagnostic tool but may also have prog- nostic strength and thus serve as a surrogate endpoint for the development of new therapies (Warach, 2001b). ADVANCES IN MRI Once a technology is accepted into clinical practice, it is inevitable that the demands of clinical specialties stim- ulate the evolution of the technology and the extension of its functionality to new applications (Jackson, 2001). For instance, interest in functional imaging led to devel- opments such as higher gradients, allowing rapid and repetitive image acquisition with high spatial and tempo- ral resolution. Echo planar imaging (EPI) was found use- ful for expanding the capabilities of MRI in the routine acquisition of T2-weighted images (Heiland et al ., 1998; Pierpaoli et al ., 1996; Warach et al ., 1995) and allowing formerly time-consuming sequences such as fat- (STIR, short tau inversion recovery) and fluid-suppressed sequences (FLAIR, fluid attenuated inversion recovery) to become practical in the clinical setting (Bydder and 3 CHAPTER 1 Seeing the Brain So We Can Save It: The Evolution of Magnetic Resonance Imaging as a Clinical Tool Peter D. Schellinger, MD, PhD Steven Warach, MD, PhD Ch01.qxd 9/2/04 11:07 AM Page 3"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"4 Seeing the Brain So We Can Save It Young, 1985; De Coene et al ., 1992). FLAIR images have substantially improved the diagnostic yield in diseases such as stroke and multiple sclerosis, where chronic vas- cular lesions and foci of demyelination are in close prox- imity to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces (Hajnal et al ., 1992). Other examples of technical progress stimulated by clinical needs include magnetic resonance angiogra- phy (Brant-Zawadzki and Heiserman, 1997; Fujita et al ., 1994; Johnson et al ., 1994) and magnetization transfer imaging (Haehnel et al ., 2000; Knauth et al ., 1996; Kurki et al ., 1994). Two techniques that have received much attention in the last 15 years are diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging (DWI and PWI) (Heiland et al ., 1997; Moseley et al ., 1991; Ostergaard et al ., 1996; Warach et al ., 1992). The phenomenon of indirectly measuring brownian molecular motion of water with DWI was first described in 1965 (Stejskal and Tanner, 1965). The measurement of water diffusion renders pathophysiological tissue infor- mation, especially in ischemic, inflammatory, and neo- plastic disease, that cannot be obtained with standard MRI sequences (Le Bihan et al ., 1986; Le Bihan et al ., 1992). In addition to the qualitative measurements of dif- fusion, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) can be quantified from measurements at different b-values (Tanner and Stejskal, 1968) on a per pixel basis, within a region of interest, or to generate ADC parameter maps. For structures, such as nerve fibers or tracts, that have a predominant direction in space, the ADC depends on the direction of the diffusion gradient. Whereas water diffu- sion is only mildly impaired in the longitudinal direction, water diffusion in a perpendicular direction to the main axis is decreased (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996); this is referred to as anisotropy. In the brain, anisotropy is most pronounced in the white matter, especially in densely packed fiber structures such as the corpus callosum and the corona radiata. The effects of anisotropy can be used to obtain information of the regional fascicular or fiber tract anatomy, which may be helpful for neurosurgical procedures. The expansion of these principles has led to the development of diffusion tensor imaging, which has been used to characterize myelination and demyelination (Le Bihan et al ., 2001; Neil et al ., 1998; Ono et al ., 1995; Pierpaoli et al ., 1996). PWI uses a dynamic bolus (paramagnetic contrast) tracking technique to derive concentration time curves, allowing the qualitative assessment of various hemody- namic parameters relative to areas of normal parenchyma (Rosen et al ., 1989, 1990; Villringer et al ., 1988). Typical parameters are mean transit time (MTT), cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow, and time to peak (TTP). The actual quantification of hemo- dynamic information has been limited by postprocessing capabilities and methods of calculating the arterial input function. Nevertheless, areas of relative hypoperfusion can be reliably demonstrated by current methods, which is of special relevance in ischemic stroke (Schlaug et al ., 1999). Other applications, such as functional imaging with the BOLD (blood oxygen level dependence) technique and spectroscopic imaging, exceed the scope of Paul C. Lauterbur Sir Peter Mansfield FIGURE 1.1 Paul C. Lauterbur and Sir Peter Mansfield. Ch01.qxd 9/2/04 11:07 AM Page 4"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"this chapter. It suffices to say that substantial technical and programming refinements have supplied neuro- science with a comprehensive diagnostic armament to guide our daily clinical practice. The growing interest in neurology for physiological data, the development of new treatment paradigms, and the definition of parameters that predict disease course will continue to promote the development and application of new imag- ing technology. MRI IN ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE Stroke is the third leading cause of death after myocardial infarction and cancer, the leading cause of permanent disability in western countries (WHO Guidelines Subcommittee, 1999), and the leading cause of disability-adjusted loss of independent life years. In addition to the tragic consequences for patients and their families, the socioeconomic impact of disabled stroke survivors is estimated to be between $35,000 and $50,000 per survivor, per year. In the face of our aging population, the incidence and prevalence of stroke are expected to rise. Therefore, an effective and widely avail- able treatment for this devastating disease is desperately needed. Before the development of MRI and continuing until the early 1990s, the stroke field was dominated by thera- peutic nihilism. Patients were treated conservatively and sent to rehabilitation units or nursing homes. Major stroke trials performed during that time focused on sec- ondary prevention. These included two trials of carotid endarterectomy for stroke attributed to internal carotid artery stenosis (European Carotid Surgery Trialists (ECST) Collaborative Group, 1991; North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) Collaborators, 1991), one small negative trial for extracranial/intracranial bypass (EC/IC Bypass Study Group, 1985), and trials testing the efficacy of anticoag- ulation (warfarin) and antiplatelet agents (acetylsalicylic acid, ticlopidine) for stroke prevention (Antiplatelet Trialists Collaboration, 1994; Antithrombotic Trialists Collaboration, 2002). Heparin, low-molecular-weight heparins, and heparinoids were tested and found ineffec- tive for early or late secondary prevention of stroke (Albers et al ., 2001). Still, trials for acute stroke therapy were lacking. Anecdotal reports of acute treatment with thrombolytics were first described in the early 1960s (Meyer et al ., 1963). Yet small trials focused on their use for subacute stroke (Schellinger et al ., 2001b); pilot trials for acute stroke did not occur until the early 1990s (Mori et al ., 1992; Yamaguchi et al ., 1993). No diagnostic imag- ing modality, including angiography, was used to estab- lish the diagnosis of stroke in any of these studies. The pilot study of Haley et al . (1993) was the first study to use a cross-sectional imaging method, noncon- trast computed tomography (CT), before therapy. After several negative acute stroke trials with streptokinase, The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) demonstrated that intravenous throm- bolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is safe and effective in patients with acute ischemic stroke after exclusion of intracerebral hemor- rhage (ICH) by noncontrast CT and when given within 3 hours of symptom onset. The NINDS trial was pub- lished in 1995 (The National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke rt-PA Stroke Study Group, 1995), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug in 1996. Three more trials assessed the efficacy of rt-PA beyond the 3-hour window but yielded negative results (Clark et al ., 1999; Hacke et al ., 1995; Hacke et al ., 1998). While the NINDS trial applied CT only for the purpose of ICH exclusion, the later trials established criteria for the diagnosis of early ischemic stroke in a widely available cross-sectional imaging method used in the routine clinical management of neu- rological diseases (von Kummer et al ., 1995). Despite the poor sensitivity of noncontrast CT within the therapeu- tic time window (at best 45% to 65% among specialists) (von Kummer et al ., 1996) and the fact that meta-analy- ses suggested a therapeutic effect of rt-PA beyond the 3-hour window in some patients (Brott, February 7-9, 2002; Hacke et al ., 1999; Wardlaw et al ., 2002), it is sur- prising that modern techniques such as CT-angiography (Knauth et al ., 1997) or MRI have not had a role in acute stroke imaging until recently (Mohr et al ., 1995). In parallel to the design and completion of the trials of thrombolytic therapy, the advent of new MRI tech- niques such as PWI and DWI has added another dimen- sion to diagnostic imaging in stroke (Hacke and Warach, 2000; Schellinger et al ., 2003; Warach et al ., 1995). A growing body of evidence has documented the useful- ness of these methods in the clinical setting (Davis et al ., 2003; Fiebach and Schellinger, 2003). Several investiga- tors have described significant correlations of DWI and PWI changes with follow-up imaging and neurological outcome (Barber et al ., 1998; Lovblad et al ., 1997; Warach et al ., 1997; Warach et al ., 1996). Others have proposed a more rational selection of therapeutic strate- gies based on the presence or absence of a tissue at risk, as identified by means of DWI and PWI patterns. The supposed lack of feasibility and practicality of MRI as a diagnostic tool in hyperacutely ill patients (Powers, 2000; Powers and Zivin, 1998; Zivin and Holloway, 2000) has been consistently disproved. Many centers have shown that logistical obstacles can be overcome (Buckley et al ., 2003; Schellinger et al ., 2000b). DWI identifies ischemic tissue changes within minutes after vessel occlusion, with Seeing the Brain So We Can Save It 5 Ch01.qxd 9/2/04 11:07 AM Page 5"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"a sensitivity of approximately 90%, and is far superior to noncontrast CT (Fiebach et al ., 2002) and conventional MRI (Mohr et al ., 1995) in this regard. In the clinical set- ting of a hyperacute stroke, a lesion on DWI with a reduction of the ADC (Le Bihan et al ., 1986) and a nor- mal T2-weighted image or FLAIR favor an acute and, in most instances, irreversible lesion. As more patients have been evaluated with stroke MRI, and at early time points, partial reversal of the initial DWI lesion has been reported. These findings suggest that the DWI lesion should be included in the therapeutic target, not as the definite infarct core (Fiehler et al ., 2002, 2003; Kidwell et al ., 2000, 2003). PWI allows the relative measurement of capillary per- fusion (Rosen et al ., 1990). Although it is not yet clinically feasible to obtain quantitative PWI parameters that differ- entiate oligemia from relevant hypoperfusion and infarct core (Yamada et al ., 2002), most authors agree that parameters such as MTT or TTP give the best prognostic information (Baird et al ., 2000; Schellinger et al ., 2001a) for patients with acute ischemic stroke. Further PWI research is aimed at differentiating oligemia from critical ischemia (Kidwell et al ., 2003), with the goal of better guiding clin- ical management. Also, the source images from PWI (sus- ceptibility-weighted images or T2 * -weighted images) have been shown to reliably depict ICH (Fiebach et al ., 2004; Linfante et al ., 1999; Schellinger et al ., 1999a), achieving a sensitivity comparable to that of noncontrast CT. The volume difference of DWI and PWI, also termed PWI/DWI-mismatch, gives an approximate measure of the tissue at risk of infarction (Figure 1.2) (Warach, 2001a). This model does not take into account that the PWI lesion includes areas of benign oligemia and that DWI abnormalities do not necessarily turn into infarc- tion (Kidwell et al ., 2003). Also, the assessment of mis- match as a percentage may be less reliable than previously thought (Coutts et al ., 2003). However, this simple model of PWI/DWI-mismatch is sufficiently accurate in most acute stroke patients, and the stroke MRI findings are consistent with our understanding of the pathophysiology of acute ischemia (Schellinger et al ., 2003; Schellinger et al ., 2001a). According to unpub- lished data (Chalela et al ., 2004; Todd et al ., 2004), early reversal of PWI is a much better predictor of clinical and imaging outcome than partial or complete DWI lesion reversal. Applying the mismatch concept may identify the individual time window for the patient and thus allow therapeutic decision making based on an individual vas- cular and hemodynamic situation, rather than elapsed time. Additional MRI findings not captured by CT, such as early blood-brain barrier disruption (Latour et al. , 2004, submitted for publication) and old microbleedings (Kidwell et al ., 2002; Nighoghossian et al ., 2002) may predict a poor outcome after thrombolysis and therefore can be used to improve patient selection. A prospective, open-label, nonrandomized multicen- ter trial examined the MRI baseline characteristics of 139 patients who presented with acute ischemic stroke within 6 hours of symptom onset and studied the influ- ence of intravenous rt-PA on MRI parameters and func- tional outcome (Röther et al ., 2002). There was a significantly higher occurrence of independent outcome after treatment with rt-PA (76 patients vs 63 control sub- jects) despite the significantly worse baseline NIHSS score and the larger volume of tissue at risk in these patients. Another study treated patients according to the NINDS protocol within the first 3 hours (N = 115) and according to stroke MRI findings in the 3- to 6-hour win- dow (N = 48). Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores and the rate of sympto- matic ICH did not differ between groups, but mortality did trend in favor of the patients receiving late rt-PA (3- to 6-hour window) according to stroke MRI criteria (16.5% vs 6.3%, P = .08). Interestingly, the outcome (independent vs dependent or dead [mRS 0-2 vs mRS 3-6]) of the stroke MRI group was better than the out- come of the group who received early intervention (47% vs 62.5%, OR 0.54, CI 0.27-1.06) based on CT and NINDS criteria. These numbers suggest that with a selec- tion tool such as stroke MRI, the time window for treat- ing stroke with thrombolytic therapy can be substantially expanded, with improved results as compared to histori- cal studies. However, this has yet to be firmly established in a randomized trial. Despite its potential, only 1% to 2% of all stroke patients receive rt-PA (Kaste, 2003). Among the major problems are the fact that relatively few candidates pre- sent within the time window and meet the clinical crite- ria. Educating the general public to regard stroke as a treatable emergency and training emergency caregivers in the use of thrombolysis can decrease these problems but demands a continuous effort. Health care institutions should be made aware of the potential in long-term cost savings once stroke management is optimized and throm- bolytic therapy is more widely available. Stroke physi- cians are frequently confronted with stroke patients who awaken with a deficit (Fink et al ., 2002) or are unable to provide the required information as a result of aphasia or disorientation. At present, these patients are excluded from thrombolytic therapy, even if a CT scan is normal or has only minor ischemic changes. Thrombolysis is often withheld in these patients even though they might profit from rapid recanalization. In contrast, MRI presently is used in many centers worldwide in the man- agement of acute stroke, beyond the NINDS time crite- ria, with thrombolysis rates ranging from 10% to 25% of the stroke patients in these centers. In due time, MRI may become not only the most powerful but also the most widely and potentially uniformly used tool to guide therapy based on individual pathophysiology rather than 6 Seeing the Brain So We Can Save It Ch01.qxd 9/2/04 11:07 AM Page 6"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"a surrogate parameter such as elapsed time. New trials for thrombolysis in acute stroke have started to apply multiparametric MRI as a screening tool for patient inclusion, including DEFUSE (USA) and EPITHET (Australia) (Parsons et al ., 2002), which perform therapy with rt-PA in the 3- to 6-hour window.

These trials currently are only in Phases I and II, but will include patients in late time win- dows up to 24 hours after stroke onset, using stroke MRI findings as inclusion criteria (Tirofiban plus rt-PA – SATIS, Mario Siebler personal communication (2003); Abciximab plus retavase – ROSIE; Eptifibatide plus ASA, LMWH, rt-PA – ROSIE 2, Steven Warach, per- sonal communication (2004)). The ongoing trials section in Stroke lists most of the new and ongoing trials (2003). Once Phase III MRI-based trials are available and yield positive results, MRI will become the required imaging modality as CT has been for nearly a decade. MRI IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelin- ating disorder and cause of neurological disability in young adults between 20 and 40 years old. MS has a higher prevalence in Caucasians from northern temperate climates (Noseworthy, 2003) and females, and affects up to 350,000 individuals in the United States (Anderson et al ., 1992). This chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) is pathologically character- ized by perivenous immune cell infiltration and myelin destruction, most likely due to autoimmune reactions against basic myelin protein, focal demyelination, and subsequent loss of oligodendrocytes and axons (Bruck et al ., 1997). Different clinical courses of MS have been defined, including relapsing remitting (RR) MS, second- ary progressive (SP) MS, primary progressive (PP) MS, and progressive relapsing (PR) MS (Lublin and Reingold, 1996). RRMS is characterized by discrete episodes of neurological symptoms followed by a variable degree of recovery and accounts for up to 85% of the initial presen- tations. This group of patients has demonstrated the best response to treatment; however, more than 50% of RRMS patients display continuous, progressive symp- toms characteristic of SPMS within 10 years (up to 90% within 25 years). By contrast, PPMS is characterized by a steady decline in neurological function from onset, with- out superimposed attacks, and is present in 10% of MS patients. MS often presents at a time when the clinical extent of disease is apparently limited, although, even at this early stage of disease, substantial damage may have already occurred. Thus, approximately 50% to 80% of individuals who present with a clinically isolated syn- drome (CIS) already have lesions on MRI, consistent with prior (occult) disease activity (Jacobs et al ., 1986). Diagnosis during a single acute episode is difficult to establish because of the variability of focal and diffuse symptoms, as well as exclusion of MS variants such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (Schwarz et al ., 2001). All existing diagnostic criteria for RRMS, includ- ing the early ones reported by Schumacher et al . (1965) and revised by Poser et al. , (1983) and a recent consensus statement (McDonald et al ., 2001) require two or more distinct events separated in time (generally by more than 1 month) in addition to involvement of at least two dis- tinct areas of the CNS (Tables 1.1 and 1.2). This is referred to as the “criteria of dissemination in time and space” (Frohman et al ., 2003). Also of importance, all of the existing diagnostic schemes require the exclusion of alternative diagnoses (among others human immunode- ficiency virus, stroke, neoplastic disease, infections) by appropriate laboratory and radiographic means. Although published in 1983, the Poser criteria already acknowledged MRI as a “paraclinical” tool for the diagnosis of MS. In those early days, MRI was a much less sensitive tool, especially with the lack of con- trast agents. With advances in technology, MRI reveals ten times as many lesions as CT (Bergers and Barkhof, 2001; Mushlin et al ., 1993) and provides a means to characterize demyelination in the spine. As MRI tech- nology has progressed, criteria for the MRI diagnosis of MS have been published (Barkhof et al ., 1997; Fazekas et al ., 1988; Paty et al ., 1988). The topic has been reviewed elsewhere in detail (Bergers and Barkhof, 2001). In brief, although T2-weighted image demon- strates foci of chronic demyelination and new lesions with edema, the diagnostic yield of FLAIR is substan- tially better because of the predominantly periventricu- lar localization of MS lesions and CSF artifact (Hashemi et al ., 1995). FLAIR studies have been espe- 8 Seeing the Brain So We Can Save It TABLE 1.1 Poser Criteria for the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Clinically definite MS: 2 Attacks a + 2 lesions on examination b 2 Attacks + 1 lesion on examination + 1 paraclinical lesion c Laboratory-supported definite MS: 2 Attacks + 1 lesion on examination or 1 paraclinical lesion + abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) d 1 Attack + 2 lesions on examination + abnormal CSF d 1 Attack + 1 lesion on examination + 1 paraclinical lesion c + abnormal CSF d Clinically probable MS: 2 Attacks + 1 lesion on examination 1 Attack + 2 lesions on examination 1 Attack + 1 lesion on examination + 1 paraclinical lesion c Laboratory-supported probable MS: 2 Attacks + abnormal CSF d From Frohman et al ., 2003; Poser et al ., 1983. a Symptoms > 24h including subjective and anamnestic lesions. b Separated by 1 month. c MRI and evoked potentials. d Oligoclonal bands or increased CNS IgG synthesis.

Precontrast and postcontrast T1-weighted images can differentiate chronic from active lesions. By combining the findings on T2- and T1-weighted images, the sensitivity for the diagnosis of clinically definite MS can reach 80% by imaging criteria alone (Barkhof et al ., 1997). The Poser scheme was developed at a time when MRI was in its infancy, and it may permit a diagnosis of MS based on unspecific white matter lesions in circumstances where it is unjustified (Frohman et al ., 2003) (Figure 1.3). It also does not allow for sequential paraclinical testing to establish dissemination in time and cannot diagnose PPMS. A new set of diagnostic criteria relying even more on MRI parameters has been proposed by McDonald et al . (2001). These criteria are more stringent than those of Poser et al ., as they allow for MRI criteria of spatial and temporal dissemination and the diagnosis of PPMS. According to the published report of the Therapeutics and Technology Assessment subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology (Frohman et al ., 2003), the evidence with respect to MRI in suspected MS is as follows: 1. The presence of three or more white matter lesions on T2-weighted image MRI predicts a diagnosis of clini- cally definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS) within the next 7 to 10 years with an 80% sensitivity (Class I-III evidence, Type A recommendation). 2. New T2-weighted image lesions or new enhancing lesions documented 3 or more months after a clini- cally isolated demyelinating episode and a baseline MRI are highly predictive for near term development of CDMS (Type A recommendation). 3. The presence of two or more enhancing lesions at baseline is highly predictive of future development of CDMS (Type B recommendation). 4. Diagnosis other than MS with a CIS with any MRI abnormality of 1–3, after exclusion of alternative diagnoses is unlikely (Type A recommendation). 5. MRI features for PPMS cannot be determined from the existing evidence (Type U recommendation). The authors recommend that studies be undertaken to assess the use of surveillance MRI as a means of moni- toring disease activity to assess the response to different therapies and therefore guide differential immunomodu- latory therapy (Frohman et al ., 2003). Although the use of conventional MRI has had a great impact on the diagnosis of MS, the heterogeneity of tissue damage and repair occurs at least partially beyond the detection sensitivity of conventional MRI (Miller et al ., 1998). As the primary pathological changes in this disease are inflammation and neurodegeneration, investigators have turned to quantitative MRI techniques including Seeing the Brain So We Can Save It 9 TABLE 1.2 McDonald Criteria for the Diagnosis of Clinically Definite a Multiple Sclerosis (CDMS) 2 Attacks b + 2 lesions on examination c 2 Attacks + 1 lesion on examination + [MRI (a) d or 2 MRI lesions + abnormal CSF] 1 Attack + 2 lesions on examination + MRI (b) e 1 Attack + 1 lesion on examination + [MRI (a) d or 2 MRI lesions + abnormal CSF] + MRI (b) e Progressive disease + abnormal CSF + MRI (b) e + a) [ ≥ 9 T2 MRI lesions or ≥ 2 spinal cord lesions or 4–8 brain MRI lesions + 1 spinal cord lesion] OR b) Abnormal (Visually Evolved Potentials) VEP c + [ ≥ 4 brain MRI lesions or <4 brain MRI lesions +1 spinal cord lesion] From Frohman et al ., 2003; McDonald et al ., 2001. a If the criteria are fulfilled and met, the diagnosis is MS.

These newer MRI applications, however, currently play more of a sci- entific role than a diagnostic and therapeutic one (Bergers and Barkhof, 2001; Filippi, 2003; Reidel et al ., 2003). In summary, MRI was suggested as an additional diag- nostic tool for MS shortly after its introduction as a clinical imaging modality (Poser et al ., 1983). After modification of the diagnostic criteria (McDonald et al ., 2001), it has been formally and firmly established as a tool in MS, which clinicians can rely on for differential diagnosis. The applica- tion of immunosuppressive drugs (corticosteroids, cy clophos- phamide, azathioprine, mitoxantrone) and initiation of modern immunomodulating medication such as β 1-a or β 1-b interferons and glatiramer acetate can be justified according to the preceding MRI criteria. Also, the most recent drug trials (interferons and glatiramer acetate) used MRI criteria for inclusion as well as a surrogate parameter in secondary endpoint analyses. Therefore, present and future management of possible or definite MS without MRI as a clinical tool to guide therapeutic decisions for acute or prophylactic treatment is almost unimaginable. 10 Seeing the Brain So We Can Save It FIGURE 1.3 A 50-year-old patient with multiple sclerosis.

These data do not include the preva- lence of benign lesions or the estimated 100,000 cases of brain metastases from a non-CNS primary cancer. The classification and prognosis of intracranial neoplasms are based on histological features including cell type, degree of anaplasia, rate of growth and invasion, and clinical factors such as patient age, onset, and progression of symptoms. In the early 1980s, the imaging gold standard for brain tumors was contrast-enhanced CT. Even in these early precontrast days of MRI, however, the ability to conduct multiplanar imaging and generate recon- structable three-dimensional datasets, reduced posterior fossa and bone artifacts, good gray/white matter contrast, sensitivity to edema (T2-weighted images), and good depiction of anatomical detail (T1-weighted images) established MRI’s considerable diagnostic strength.

In 1993, the WHO revised the histological typing of CNS tumors to include new entities described in the era of MRI such as neuroecto- dermal and dysembryoblastic neuroepidermal tumors, ganglioglioma, and neurocytoma (Kleihues et al ., 1993). As brain metastases are the first sign of disease in 10% of all non-CNS primary neoplasms (up to 25% of lung cancers) and are multiple in up to 50% of patients (Posner and Chernik, 1978), the application of MRI to evaluating brain tumors substantially changed clinical procedures. Approximately half the patients with pre- sumed solitary metastases are candidates for surgical excision of brain metastases. With adjuvant whole-brain irradiation, median survival times of 14 months can be achieved (Patchell et al ., 1986, 1990; Smalley et al ., 1992). As the optimum therapy depends on the number and location of brain metastases, the diagnostic accuracy of a neuroradiological technique is of utmost importance. Contrast-enhanced MRI is far superior to contrast- enhanced CT in detecting multiple lesions. In 32% of patients with a contrast-enhanced CT-defined solitary metastasis, there will be multiple lesions on contrast- enhanced MRI (CI = 16.2% to 49.0%, P = .01) (Schellinger et al ., 1999b). As in MS, magnetization transfer imaging substantially improves the diagnostic yield for primary and secondary brain tumors and is at least as sensitive as triple dose Gd-DTPA (Knauth et al ., 1996), which, because of potential side effects and cost, should no longer be applied. Newer imaging techniques such as DWI and PWI have been applied to aid in the differential diagnosis of brain tumors from non-neoplastic lesions such as tume- factive demyelinating lesions (TDL), abscesses, benign cystic lesions, and radiation necrosis, which require dif- ferent treatment or for which surgical intervention is not indicated. As DWI and PWI techniques reflect changes such as ischemia, necrosis, and angiogenesis, the infor- mation from these studies is interesting for the applica- tion to the diagnosis of intracranial mass lesions, optimization of biopsy selection, and as a means of noninvasive surveillance during treatment. The distinc- tion of an abscess from a cystic or necrotic tumor, one that is difficult using only conventional imaging and clinical symptoms, is more reliably made using DWI and ADC values (Guzman et al ., 2002). Both types of lesions can appear as solitary or multiple lesions with low T1 and high T2 signal intensities with ring enhance- ment after contrast administration. However, as DWI reflects the restriction of free water movement, this method is well suited to detect differences in lesion vis- cosity. Purulent abscesses contain a highly viscous com- bination of inflammatory cells, debris, and bacteria, whereas in cystic and necrotic areas of tumors, there is reduced restriction as a result of the disruption of the intrinsic physical and chemical barriers to water diffusion (Wilms et al ., 2001). As the recruitment of vascular networks is crucial for tumor extension and proliferation, vascular morphology is a critical parameter in determining malignant poten- tial. Dynamic blood volume imaging of patients with brain tumors can provide unique information about tumor grade and vascularity that is not appreciated from CT, T2-weighted images, or contrast-enhanced T1- weighted images. TDL can mimic high-grade neoplasms, as both enhance with contrast on T1-weighted imaging and have perilesion edema and variable mass effect and central necrosis (Zagzag et al ., 1993). There have been numerous reports of unnecessary surgery and radiation therapy in these patients as a result of the difficulty of diagnosing this process from primary glioma or lym- phoma. PWI may play a helpful role in the characteriza- tion of these processes, as the vasculature of TDL remains normal in contrast to the neovascular prolifera- tion of tumors (Cha et al ., 2001). MRI measurements of CBV have been shown to correlate with conventional angiographic assessments of tumor vascularity and his- tological specimens of tumor neovascularization (Knopp et al ., 1999). Although elevated CBV is highly suggestive of neoplasm, increased vascularity alone does not con- firm malignancy. Benign extra-axial neoplasms such as meningioma and choroid plexus papilloma are highly vascular. However, these tumors often can be identified by their anatomical location and features on conven- tional MRI. MRI has changed not only clinical management because of a higher diagnostic yield but also daily neu- rological and neurosurgical practice. Not all tumors are candidates for surgical resection; however, confirmation of the pathology is critical for treatment decisions or enrollment in a clinical trial. Imaging and the develop- ment of intraoperative MRI suites (Tronnier et al ., 1997) have played an increasing role in assisting with biopsy guidance as part of frameless navigation sys- tems. Intraoperative shifts and resulting inaccuracies have been a concern in frame-based and frameless stereotactically guided interventions, particularly in open microsurgical procedures. MRI data sets, acquired during surgery and used to update neuronavigation, have shown promise to compensate for brain shift and may increase the number of cases where radiologically complete resection can be achieved (Wirtz et al ., 1997). In high-grade gliomas, two consecutive series showed that intraoperative MRI can be performed without complications, with a good image quality and signifi- cant improvement in surgical resection (Knauth et al ., 1999; Wirtz et al ., 2000b). For high-grade gliomas, 12 Seeing the Brain So We Can Save It Ch01.qxd 9/2/04 11:07 AM Page 12"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"intraoperative MRI reduced the percentage of cases in which residual tumor was identified from 62% to 33%, paralleled by a significant increase in survival times for patients without residual tumor (Wirtz et al ., 2000a). Operating times were identical in a matched group analysis of patients with glioblastoma operated with and without intraoperative MRI (Wirtz et al ., 2000b). Radiological radicality was achieved in 31% of naviga- tion cases vs 19% in conventional operations and again radical tumor resection was associated with a highly sig- nificant prolongation in survival (median 18.3 vs 10.3 months, P < 0.0001). Survival was also longer in patients operated on using neuronavigation (median 13.4 vs 11.1 months) (Wirtz et al ., 2000a). (See Figure 1.4.) Functional MRI is another technique that aids in neu- rosurgical therapy, as it can correlate the MR images with the observed neurological deficit (Wilms et al ., 2001). In the same way it can predict functional deficit if an aggressive surgical therapy involving sensitive brain areas is planned (Stippich et al ., 2002, 2003). In the pres- ence of potential misinterpretation of anatomical land- marks because of tissue shift from mass effect and edema, intraoperative functional MRI (fMRI) allows the exact localization of tumor with respect to eloquent functional brain areas (Wilms et al ., 2001). Therefore, fMRI can contribute to more efficient surgical removal of both benign and malignant brain tumors, with an increase in patient survival and a decrease in surgical morbidity (Wilms et al ., 2001). In summary, MRI has added to diagnostic sensitivity and classification of primary, metastatic, and recurrent brain tumors. As a result of this improved sensitivity and with the use of modern MRI sequences, therapeutic deci- sion making and procedures for the treatment of patients with CNS tumors have been influenced. As in the fields of stroke and MS, larger trials of chemotherapy may in the future also use surrogate MRI parameters for inclu- sion criteria and as secondary endpoints. MRI IN THE DESIGN OF THERAPEUTIC TRIALS IN NEUROLOGY The disappointingly slow progress in developing effective therapies in neurological disease has led to a reevaluation of the strategies for clinical trials in stroke (thrombolytics, neuroprotectants), MS (immuno- suppressors, immunomodulators), and brain tumors (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, neurosurgery). As described previously, MS trials have used MRI as a tool for inclusion into studies as well as a surrogate param- eter for secondary endpoint analyses. This section illus- trates the relevance of MRI for therapeutic trials using stroke trials as the example. To demonstrate efficacy in a clinical trial, the features of trial design need to be optimized. Proof of pharmacological activity in Phase II is needed before lengthy, expensive, labor-intensive, and potentially risky Phase III clinical trials are under- taken. The requirement of proof of concept Phase II studies will prevent the wastefulness of Phase III trials that are doomed to futility before they begin. Image- guided Phase II studies may answer the question of tar- Seeing the Brain So We Can Save It 13 A FIGURE 1.4 A 54-year-old patient with biopsy confirmed diagnosis of glioblastoma in the right temporooccip- ital region.

This is important because trends toward benefit using clinical scales at Phase II have in the past been notoriously poor predictors of clinical outcomes in Phase III trials on much larger samples, especially in stroke but also in MS trials. It would be unthinkable for clinical trials in cardiol- ogy or oncology to enroll patients by bedside clinical impression alone, without objective evidence from diag- nostic testing confirming the pathology. Yet this has been the traditional standard by which clinical trials for ischemic stroke have been conducted because, until recently, there was no practical alternative. Stroke MRI provides that alternative. In using MRI as a selection criterion, the goal would be a sample selection based on a positive imaging diagnosis of a pathology rationally linked to the drug’s mechanisms of action. Requiring a positive diagnosis of acute ischemic injury by DWI and PWI would ideally ensure that no patients with diag- noses mimicking stroke are included in the sample, a desirable objective unachievable in trials using bedside impression and nonhemorrhagic CT as the basis of inclusion. The goal of image-based patient selection is to narrow the range of patient characteristics, leading to a more homogeneous sample, reducing within group vari- ance, and increasing the statistical power (lowering sam- ple size requirement) of the experimental design to demonstrate efficacy. For reperfusion therapies, the opti- mal target of therapy would be patients with evidence of 14 Seeing the Brain So We Can Save It C B FIGURE 1.4, cont’d B: Intraoperative MRI after resection (T1-weighted image postcontrast, 0.2 T) shows resid- ual enhancing tumor below the craniotomy defect.

For neuroprotective drugs acting only in cortical areas of ischemic penumbra, optimal selection of patients could be based on demonstration of acute lesions involv- ing the cerebral cortex or deep gray matter. For some neuroprotective drugs, the diffusion-perfusion mismatch may be the optimal target. For other agents that would protect against reperfusion injury or would not achieve sufficient concentration in oligemic tissue, the optimal target would be a patient in whom reperfusion has occurred. Patients may be excluded from the trial at screening if subacute or chronic lesions are found, which could confound measurements of lesion volumes or clin- ical severity as outcome variables. Furthermore, clear definition of lesion volume at enrollment would provide an opportunity to evaluate lesion growth and may better differentiate an effective treatment from placebo. Before an experimental stroke therapy is brought from the laboratory to clinical trial, it is necessary to demonstrate that the treatment causes reduction in lesion volume in experimental models. The fundamental premise of drug discovery and development in acute stroke is that treatments that reduce lesion size are those most likely to lead to clinical benefit. In clinical trial programs that depend solely on clinical endpoints as indices of benefit, drugs may be brought to Phase III testing without evidence that the drug will have the ther- apeutic effect observed in the experimental model. In practice, this traditional approach to stroke trials has been unsuccessful and often misleading. Four major fac- tors are hypothesized to predict tissue response and clin- ical efficacy in stroke trials: time to treatment, the salvageable tissue-at-risk, the relevance of the patient sample to the treatment, and the intrinsic effectiveness of the therapeutic strategy (Warach, 2001b). Time is an important factor (Marler et al ., 2000), but it is not the only important factor hypothesized to affect response to therapy. The clinical trial optimized on all features would be expected to have the most robust response. Stroke is a special case among brain diseases because: (1) it is a single event that is not progressive beyond the initial hours and days, (2) there is a high rate of spontaneous clinical recovery (implying that clinical improvement is less reflective of drug effect), (3) it requires rapid diagnosis under emergency conditions (the diagnostic certainty is less), and (4) a single discrete lesion fully captures the pathology (the clinical manifes- tations result from the size and location of the ischemic damage). For stroke the true clinical endpoint, disabil- ity, is difficult to measure and is only approximated by clinical scales. Furthermore, experts do not agree on how to measure outcome using clinical scales, and the criterion of “complete recovery” used in many trials may include patients with significant disability. For these reasons, lesion volume as a biomarker is likely to be more helpful for stroke than in cancer and cardiac disorders. Ordinarily a drug must have a beneficial effect on a clinical endpoint or on a validated surrogate endpoint to demonstrate effectiveness and lead to registration. Current FDA regulations stipulate that for unmet med- ical needs for serious and life-threatening conditions such as stroke, a drug may be approved based on a nonvali- dated surrogate endpoint if it is reasonably likely to have clinical benefit. The internationally accepted regulatory standards of the International Conference on Harmo- nization also state that surrogate endpoints may be used as primary endpoints when the surrogate is reasonably likely to predict clinical outcome. Much of the thought on the use of biomarkers as measures of drug activity and potential surrogates have come from fields such as oncology or cardiology, where death or a comparably objective and reliable assessment is the relevant clinical endpoint. For these disease categories, the biomarker does not fully capture the pathology of the disease as well as the clinical endpoint. However, the use of biomarkers and potential surrogates are different for brain disorders in which disability (defined by imperfect clinical rating scales) rather than death is the relevant clinical variable, and in which the biomarker (macroscopic brain lesion) more fully captures the pathology than the clinical scales. If the results on clinical and imaging endpoints were dis- cordant, what are the possible explanations? If lesion vol- ume decreases, without clinical improvement, the most likely explanations are the trial design or the choice of clin- ical endpoints that is insensitive to the drug effect, or that a toxicity affecting the clinical outcome offsets any neuro- protective effect of the therapy. If clinical improvement occurs without lesion volume changes, the imaging meth- ods may be insensitive to the drug effect, or the clinical ben- efit is not mediated by a direct effect on the evolving infarct. The latter possibility may apply to classes of drugs that, for example, treat post-stroke mood disorders or would lead to enhanced recovery through functional reorganization. These comparisons are only meaningful if studies are opti- mally designed and equally powered to show effect on their respective outcome measures, i.e., the optimal sample size for imaging studies may be too small to show clinical effects. An imaging benefit may never stand alone as a surrogate, without evidence of clinical benefit. While full validation must eventually be proven, MR surrogate meas- ures may help in achieving that goal. One could imagine a small but statistically significant volume reduction that would have a trivial or undetectable clinical effect. Nonetheless, a benefit on the surrogate may be acceptable Seeing the Brain So We Can Save It 15 Ch01.qxd 9/2/04 11:07 AM Page 15"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"16 Seeing the Brain So We Can Save It as an independent source of confirmatory data in support of benefit seen in clinical endpoint trials. However, an application for registration of a stroke drug using MRI outcomes has not yet been submitted to regulatory agencies. The pharmaceutical industry has taken the initiative in investigating this final step in validation. The results of several industry-sponsored drug trials using MRI as a surrogate will be known over the next several years, and those studies should provide the most decisive informa- tion regarding the utility of MRI as a measure in stroke trials. MRI-based recruitment trials with a window of 6 hours have proven feasible, as have selection based on lesion size, location, and the PWI/DWI-mismatch. The field of stroke clinical trials continues to examine oppor- tunities for improving trial design, using imaging to con- firm, rather than exclude, pathology, and in treatment assessment; these are obvious, useful roles. That MRI is increasingly used as a selection tool and an outcome measure in stroke trials reflects the growing recognition that direct pathophysiological imaging may provide a more rational approach to stroke therapeutics. Patient selection and outcomes based exclusively on clinical assessment and nonhemorrhagic CT scans may no longer be appropriate for all stroke trials. CONCLUSION Most neurologists and neurosurgeons are convinced that MRI is at least as effective as CT in most diseases of the CNS, even if there are only few directly comparative studies. A new and better imaging technique should result in both improvement in quality of care and reduc- tion of health care costs (Demaerel, 2001). Although suf- ficiently large and methodologically sound studies with regard to cost effectiveness of MRI are still lacking, the overall impression is that MRI has revolutionized not only the diagnosis but also the management of neurolog- ically ill patients. Contemporary management of MS patients and patients with neoplastic disease of the CNS now firmly incorporates the use of MRI. MRI has also become a major player in the field of stroke, which is of extraordinary relevance given its high disease burden. MRI does not yet have such an impact on management for hereditary, degenerative, and metabolic neurological diseases with no or poor therapeutic options. However, given the rapid evolution of the diagnostic strength of MRI and the advantages of a lack of harmful radiation, the use of a well-tolerated contrast agent, the overall availability of the modality as a result of an ever-increas- ing number of scanners, and the continuous reduction of imaging times as a result of technological progress, this too is likely to change.

Hsia, MD Gregory W. Albers, MD CHAPTER 2 Stroke continues to be the leading cause of disability in industrialized nations and is one of the most difficult therapeutic challenges for physicians. Developments in neuroimaging and other diagnostic tests have improved our ability to identify and localize ischemic brain lesions and clarify their underlying etiologies. Until recently, however, physicians had no effective means of treating acute stroke. The success of thrombolytic therapy for acute stroke has invigorated clinical research aimed at identifying additional treatment options to expand and improve on intravenous thrombolysis. In the first part of this chapter, we focus on the large clinical trials of throm- bolytic therapy for stroke and the clinical trial methodol- ogy that led to the success of the National Institutes of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) IV tPA trial. Since most stroke patients are not eligible for acute treatment, improving our ability to prevent stroke remains of critical importance. The second part of this chapter highlights the developments of specific antihy- pertensive, lipid-lowering, and antiplatelet agents that have expanded our armamentarium to diminish stroke risk. Looking to the future, we discuss the development of a new oral anticoagulant and ongoing challenges in the quest for a clinically effective neuroprotectant. ACUTE TREATMENT: THROMBOLYTICS The use of thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke is the consequence of recent advances in clinical stroke trial design. The pivotal study from the NINDS recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) Stroke Study Group (1995) documented a significant benefit of IV rt-PA treatment of acute ischemic stroke within 3 hours of symptom onset. Based on this report, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved rt-PA for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke within 3 hours of symptom onset. Background The investigation of thrombolytic agents for stroke treatment developed because the majority of ischemic strokes are caused by thrombotic or thromboembolic occlusions of cerebral vasculature. Without thrombolytic therapy, early spontaneous recanalization occurs in only a minority of patients (Del Zoppo et al ., 1998; Kassem- Moussa and Graffagnino, 2002). Animal stroke models have demonstrated clot lysis with thrombolytic agents and improved neurological outcome following thrombol- ysis (Zivin et al ., 1985; Del Zoppo et al ., 1986). Initiation of human stroke trials was also encouraged by the suc- cess of streptokinase (SK) for the treatment of myocar- dial infarction first reported in 1988 in the Second International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-2) (1988). Clinical Trials (Table 2.1) Streptokinase SK was studied for use in acute ischemic stroke in three large randomized trials that were conducted in Europe and Australia (Donnan et al ., 1995, 1996). All three of the trials were terminated early because of safety concerns. The Multicenter Acute Stroke Trial-Italy 21 Ch02.qxd 9/1/04 6:29 AM Page 21"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"(MAST-I) (1995) and the MAST -Europe trial (1996) ran- domized patients to a fixed dose of SK within 6 hours of stroke onset, whereas the Australian Streptokinase Trial (ASK) (Donnan et al ., 1996) randomized patients to a fixed dose of SK within 4 hours of onset. The fixed dose used in all three stroke trials was the same as that used for the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI). No studies designed to clarify the optimal dose of SK for stroke patients were undertaken before embarking on the large treatment trials. An indirect analysis using data from the MAST-E trial showed a trend for increased risk of early death in patients with lower body weight and thus a higher relative dose of SK (Cornu et al ., 2000). This may be one explanation for the failed trials of SK treatment for stroke: The dose used may have been too high and was not adjusted for patient weight. SK is also frequently associated with h ypotension when used for MI (10% of treated patients in ISIS-2 compared to 2% treated with placebo) and variably reported in stroke (20% of treated patients in the ASK trial, 1.9% in MAST-I, and 0.6% in MAST-E). In stroke patients acute hypotension could theoretically cause impaired blood flow to the ischemic penumbra, leading to poorer outcomes (Cornu et al ., 2000). Finally, because SK has more prolonged fibrino- gen depletion and anticoagulant effects compared to rt-PA, these differences may have contributed to the higher rates of hemorrhagic transformation (Cornu et al ., 2000). Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator (rt-PA) Multiple safety and feasibility studies investigating the potential use of rt-PA in acute stroke were conducted before the large-scale stroke trials (Brott et al ., 1992; Haley et al ., 1992). Based on dose-finding studies, a dose substantially less than that used for treatment of MI (0.9 mg/kg) was selected as the optimal dose for the large clinical trials. The NINDS t-PA Stroke Study Group performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous tPA for ischemic stroke within 3 hours of symptom onset (1995). A total of 624 patients were enrolled to receive either intravenous tPA 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg) or placebo. Therapy with tPA was ini- tiated with a bolus (10% of the total dose) infused over 1 minute, and the remainder of the total dose infused over 60 minutes. A pretreatment computed tomography (CT) scan was required to exclude the presence of intra- cerebral hemorrhage (ICH). To minimize the risk of treatment-related ICH, strict inclusion and exclusion cri- teria were adhered to. After treatment, blood pressure was strictly maintained within prespecified values, and the use of antiplatelets and anticoagulants was not permitted for 24 hours. The trial was conducted in two parts. Part 1 included 291 patients and was designed to assess the early clinical efficacy of tPA measured by an improvement in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score by four or more points or complete neurological recovery 24 hours after stroke onset. Part 2 included 333 patients and was designed to evaluate clinical outcomes at 3 months, focusing on the percentages of patients with minimal or no deficits. In Part 1, no significant difference was detected in the percentages of patients with neurological improvement at 24 hours as previously defined. However, a secondary analysis did find significant improvement in median NIHSS scores among the tPA group. In Part 2, the results of all outcome measures favored the tPA group. Benefits were consistent regardless of patient age, stroke subtype, and stroke severity. Treated patients were 30% more likely to have minimal or no dis- ability at 3 months compared to placebo-treated patients, 22 Advances in the Acute Treatment and Secondary Prevention of Stroke TABLE 2.1 Data From the Four Major Trials of IV tPA for Stroke, Comparing Dose, Therapeutic Window, Mortality, and OR for Benefit of tPA in the Incidence of Death and Dependency Symptomatic ICH Mortality Benefit Patients Dose, mg Window tPA Placebo tPA Placebo Death or Dependency Study No. (Maximum) h % % % % OR (95% CI) NINDS 624 0.9 (90) ≤ 3 6.4 0.6 17.4 20.6 0.49 (0.35–0.69) ECASS-I 620 1.1 (100) ≤ 6 19.8 * 6.5 * 22 15.6 0.68 (0.55–0.95) ECASS-II 800 0.9 (90) ≤ 6 8.8 3.4 10.5 10.7 0.72 (0.55–0.95) ATLANTIS-B 547 0.9 (90) 3–5 7.0 1.1 11.0 6.9 1.04 (—) * Parenchymal hematoma (symptomatic ICH not reported in ECASS-I).

Symptomatic ICH occurred in 6.4% of treated patients vs 0.6% for placebo ( P < .001); however, there was no difference in mortality. The benefit of IV tPA seen at 3 months in the NINDS study was sustained over the long term. During a 12- month follow-up evaluation of these patients, the bene- fit of tPA over placebo remained virtually identical, with an 11% to 13% absolute increase in the number of patients achieving excellent outcomes (Kwiatkowski et al ., 1999). The European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) trial (Hacke et al ., 1995) was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomized 620 patients within 6 hours of stroke onset to treatment with IV tPA at a dose of 1.1 mg/kg (total dose limit 100 mg) or placebo. The protocol excluded patients with the most severe hemispheric stroke symptoms and patients with major early infarct signs on CT scan exceeding one third of the MCA territory. Primary outcome measures were the Barthel Index (BI) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months after treatment. Both an intention-to- treat (ITT) analysis and a target population (TP) (per- protocol) analysis were performed. A total of 109 patients were excluded from the TP analysis primarily because of the presence of extensive early ischemic changes on CT scan. There was no difference in BI scores at 3 months for either the ITT or TP groups. In the TP analysis, there was a significant difference in the mRS favoring tPA. There was no difference in mortality at 30 days; however, the incidence of parenchymal hemor- rhages was significantly more frequent in the tP-treated patients (19.8% vs 6.5% in the placebo group). In an explanatory analysis of the ECASS data, advanced age was associated with an increased risk of parenchymal hemorrhage, while time-to-treatment was not related (Larrue et al ., 1997). The initial clinical stroke severity and the presence of early ischemic changes on CT scan were associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic infarction. The investigators concluded that tPA may have a net benefit if patient selection could be improved to exclude patients at higher risk for complications, par- ticularly those with major early infarct signs on CT scan. The ECASS investigators also suggested that the higher dose of tPA used may have contributed to the increased hemorrhagic complications, a relationship sup- ported by data from the myocardial infarction trials. Furthermore, strict blood pressure parameters were not included in this protocol. Therefore, ECASS II (Hacke et al ., 1998) was designed with a lower dose of tPA (0.9 mg/kg to match the NINDS protocol) given within 6 hours of symptom onset, strict guidelines for blood pressure control, and strict adherence to CT criteria, including investigator participation in CT training courses before and during the course of the study. ECASS II also found no significant difference in the pri- mary outcome (the percentage of patients with a favor- able outcome [score 0 to 1] on mRS at 3 months). However, for the secondary post-hoc outcome of func- tional independence (score 0 to 2) on mRS, there was a significant difference in favor of tPA. Although there was a 2.5-fold increase in the symptomatic intracerebral hem- orrhage rate for tPA-treated patients vs placebo, there was no difference in mortality. Patients in ECASS II had less severe strokes, with baseline median NIHSS scores of 11 in both groups, compared to 14 and 15 in the NINDS trial. This finding may account for the better outcomes in the ECASS II placebo group compared to the other tPA studies and may contribute to the lack of a substantial treatment effect on the primary outcome. Also, most patients (642 of 800) were treated in the 3- to 6-hour win- dow, whereas in the NINDS trial, all patients were treated within 3 hours, and half within 90 minutes of stroke onset. The Alteplase Thrombolysis for Acute Noninter- ventional Therapy in Ischemic Stroke (ATLANTIS) trial (Albers et al ., 2002) had sever al similarities to ECASS II. The patients enrolled had milder strokes (median NIHSS score 11) and were treated at a later time (median time to treatment 4 hours 35 minutes) than the NINDS study. The ATLANTIS study design was similar to the NINDS study except for the time windows. ATLANTIS Part A began in 1991 with a 0- to 6-hour time window, which was changed in 1993 to 0 to 5 hours (Part B) because of safety concerns in the 5- to 6-hour window. There was no benefit in the treatment group for outcome measures at 3 months either for the target population treated in the 3- to 5-hour win- dow or in the ITT analysis. However, a prespecified analy- sis of the 61 patients in ATLANTIS who were enrolled within 3 hours of stroke onset did find that the tPA-treated patients were more likely to have a very favorable outcome (NIHSS = 1) at 3 months ( P = .01), supporting the con- clusions of the NINDS study. Primarily based on the success of the NINDS studies, in 1996 the FDA approved tPA for use in early acute ischemic stroke. After the publication of the NINDS tri- als, reports of clinical practice experience with IV tPA both in academic and community settings have demon- strated similar safety and clinical outcomes when the NINDS criteria were strictly used (Albers et al ., 2000). The advent of an effective treatment for acute ischemic stroke has energized clinicians and spurred local and national stroke education campaigns. It has also stimu- lated ongoing research, including efforts to expand the therapeutic window of tPA using advanced neuroimag- ing techniques for patient selection, endovascular delivery of thrombolytics, and coupling of tPA with neuroprotective therapies. Advances in the Acute Treatment and Secondary Prevention of Stroke 23 Ch02.qxd 9/1/04 6:29 AM Page 23"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"STROKE PREVENTION Treatment of Hypertension The latest report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure emphasizes the need for more aggres- sive blood pressure (BP) control to prevent cardiovascular disease, including stroke (Chobanian et al ., 2003). Normal BP is now defined as <120/80. For those 40 to 70 years old, each increment of 20 mm Hg in systolic BP or 10 mm Hg in diastolic BP doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease across the entire BP range from 115/75 to 185/115 (Lewington et al., 2002). To achieve adequate BP control, clinical trials have demonstrated that most patients will require two or more antihypertensive medications. For primary and secondary stroke prevention, the effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers has recently gained attention. Why have these particular classes of antihypertensives been of interest? There is both theoret- ical and clinical evidence to support the vascular and cardiac benefits of blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldos- terone system (RAAS). This system controls systemic blood pressure through multiple mechanisms including modulation of the sympathetic nervous system, as well as direct effects on the heart, kidneys, and blood vessels (Weir and Henrich, 2000). The RAAS maintains salt and water homeostasis but may also promote chronic hyper- tension (Ruland and Gorelick, 2003). In this system, angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II, a peptide hormone, has many vascular effects including vasoconstriction, inflammation, vascular remodeling, thrombosis, and plaque rupture primarily via activation of angiotensin II type 1 receptors (Schiffrin, 2002; McFarlane et al., 2003). Many of these effects are medi- ated via direct effects on endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. Angiotensin II and aldosterone increase the production of plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1), the most important physiologi- cal inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (TPA) in plasma, and promote platelet aggregation (Lonn et al ., 1994; Ruland and Gorelick, 2003). Angiotensin II is a major contributor to the generation of reactive oxygen species that oppose the vascular effects of nitric oxide, including the inhibition of the growth, remodeling, and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells, as well as the expression of proinflammatory molecules (McFarlane et al ., 2003). Therefore, an imbalance between reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide leads to activation of endothelins (potent vasoconstrictors) and up regulation of proinflammatory mediators that contribute to vascu- lar disease (Schiffrin, 2002). The exact mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors may prevent vascular disease are not completely understood; however, multiple potential mechanisms have been hypoth- esized based on the actions of angiotensin II described pre- viously (Figure 2.1). By blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, ACE inhibitors may improve vascular compliance, reduce vascular smooth muscle proliferation, and have plaque-stabilizing as well as antithrombotic and antiinflammatory effects. They improve renal blood flow and reduce aldosterone secre- tion, thus reducing reabsorption of sodium (Ruland and Gorelick, 2003). ACE inhibitors also prevent the breakdown of bradykinin, and it has been suggested that many of the known clinical benefits of ACE inhibitors may be to a large extent related to the increased concentrations of bradykinin in serum and possibly tissue (Weir and Henrich, 2000). Bradykinin is a powerful vasodilator that also secondarily augments the production of other vasodilators such as nitric oxide and cyclic GMP (Weir and Henrich, 2000). It causes a cascade of vasodilatory and antithrombotic effects. Human clinical studies have shown that plasma angiotensin II levels remain at or above pretreatment levels with chronic dosing of an ACE inhibitor, localizing the effects of ACE inhibitors per- haps to the vascular tissue (Weir and Henrich, 2000). Furthermore, it has been shown that a bradykinin recep- tor antagonist can inhibit the blood pressure-lowering effects of an ACE inhibitor, thus pointing to bradykinin as a potent mediator in the setting of ACE inhibitors (Weir and Henrich, 2000). Angiotensin II acts via type 1 and type 2 receptors. The type 1 receptors mediate the known effects of angiotensin II. The current angiotensin receptor (AT 1 ) blockers specifically block these type I receptors (Figure 2.1). There is evidence that the clinically observed benefits of AT 1 blockade may, to a large extent, be due to stimulation of the type 2 receptors, which are expressed more commonly in diseased and damaged tissues, rather than direct antagonism of the type 1 receptors (Weir and Henrich, 2000; Schiffrin, 2002). While the function of the type 2 receptors is less well defined, it appears to be antag- onistic to type 1, thereby stimulating vasodilation via the bradykinin-nitric oxide-cyclic guanine monophosphate cascade as well as inhibiting smooth muscle cell prolifera- tion and inflammatory responses (Weir and Henrich 2000; Schiffrin 2002). There have been several recent large randomized trials that have demonstrated the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in primary or secondary stroke prevention. Debate persists as to whether this benefit is due purely to the BP-lowering effect of these agents or to additional vascular protective effects described previously, which may be specific to these 24 Advances in the Acute Treatment and Secondary Prevention of Stroke Ch02.qxd 9/1/04 6:29 AM Page 24"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Advances in the Acute Treatment and Secondary Prevention of Stroke 25 particular classes of antihypertensive agents (Anderson, 2003; Bath, 2003; Davis and Donnan, 2003). The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) (The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation Study Investigators, 2000) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the use of an ACE inhibitor, ramipril, for the prevention of the composite outcome of MI, stroke, and cardiovascular death in high-risk cardio- vascular disease patients. Of the 9541 patients random- ized, 1013 had a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. The mean BP at enrollment was 139/79. There was a 22% relative risk reduction (RRR) in the primary composite outcome. In fact, the study was terminated early because of the clear benefit of ramipril. There was also a 32% RRR of any stroke (3.4% vs 4.9% stroke inci- dence for ramipril and placebo, respectively) and a 61% RRR of fatal stroke (0.4% vs 1%) in the ramipril group (Bosch et al ., 2002). Despite these large cardiovascular outcome benefits, there was only a small reduction in BP (3/2 mm Hg) with treatment. Based on data derived from the World Health Organization and the International Society of Hypertension, the expected relative risk of MI and stroke from this small BP reduction would have been 5% and 13%, respectively, rather than the observed reductions of 20% and 32%, respectively (Sleight et al ., 2001). Therefore, it has been hypothesized that much of the beneficial effect of ramipril on vascular events may be independent of its BP-lowering effect (Sleight et al ., 2001). Alternatively, it has been suggested that the study’s daytime BP measurements may have underestimated the 24-hour BP reduction of ramipril, which was adminis- tered as a nighttime dose. A small substudy of HOPE monitored 38 patients with peripheral vascular disease who underwent 24-hour ambulatory BP (ABP) monitor- ing before randomization and after 1 year (Svensson et al ., 2001). This substudy found that the 24-hour ABP was significantly reduced (10/4 mm Hg) primarily because of a more pronounced BP-lowering effect during nighttime (17/8 mm Hg). Therefore, the benefits of ramipril may be more attributable to the reduction in BP than previously concluded, although these findings are drawn from a very small sample size. The benefit of BP low ering for reducing the risk of recurrent stroke was definitively shown in the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) (2001). This investigator-initiated trial was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the effects of a flexible BP-low ering regimen based on an ACE inhibitor (perindopril) with or without FIGURE 2.1 Mechanisms of action of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 blockers.

Of the 6105 patients enrolled, there was a 28% RRR for recurrent stroke for those assigned active treatment over placebo (10% vs 14% stroke incidence). The overall reduction in recurrent stroke risk was comparable to the reduction in primarily initial stroke risk seen in the HOPE study (32%) and included reduction in the outcome endpoints of nonfatal or disabling stroke (24%), ischemic stroke (24%), and cerebral hemorrhage (50%). Combination therapy with perindopril plus indapamide reduced BP by 12/5 mm Hg and stroke risk by 43%, whereas perindopril alone reduced BP by 5/3 mm Hg and had no significant effect on stroke risk. There were similar benefits for both the hypertensive and nonhypertensive subgroups, although hypertension was defined as a systolic BP >160 or a diastolic BP >90 at baseline, a cutoff level quite high compared with current guidelines of 120/80 (Chobanian et al ., 2003). The mean baseline BP of those classified as hypertensive was 159/94 mm Hg and for the nonhyper- tensive was 137/79 mm Hg. In addition to the stroke risk reduction, there was a 26% reduction in major vascular events including a 38% reduction in nonfatal MI. Combination therapy of perindopril plus indapamide clearly resulted in larger BP reductions and larger risk reductions than perindopril alone. PROGRESS demon- strated that aggressive BP lowering can significantly reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and major vascular events, even in patients who may already be treated with other stroke prevention therapy such as antiplatelets or anticoagulants. It was not designed, however, to test for potential benefits of the ACE inhibitor independent of its BP-lowering effect, as the study was powered to detect a 30% reduction in total stroke risk among those receiv- ing active treatment over placebo. While PROGRESS did not seek to establish a benefit of the ACE inhibitor perindopril beyond its BP-lowering effect, the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint reduction (LIFE) trial (Dahlof et al ., 2002) did aim to determine whether the ARB, losartan, had cardiovascular benefits independent of BP-lowering. LIFE was an investigator- initiated, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of losartan (the first angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker) vs atenolol in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy for the prevention of cardiovas- cular morbidity and death. Atenolol was chosen as the comparator because it was recognized worldwide as a first-line treatment for hypertension with similar antihy- pertensive efficacy to losartan. Hydrochlorothiazide and additional antihypertensive agents (except ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and β -blockers) could be added to the blinded study medications if needed to achieve a goal BP <140/90. Blood pressures were reduced substantially in both groups (by 30.2/16.6 and 29.1/16.8 mm Hg in the losartan and atenolol groups, respectively). There was equal use of additional antihypertensive agents between the two groups. During a mean follow-up period of 4.8 years, there was a 13% RRR for the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke for losartan over atenolol. Furthermore, there was a 25% RRR for stroke for losartan-treated patients; of the 9193 subjects who participated, 232 losartan patients and 309 atenolol patients experienced a stroke. There were fewer MIs than strokes in both groups and no difference in the incidence of MI between the two groups. There was a very small difference between groups in systolic and dias- tolic blood pressures but not in mean arterial pressure. Adjustment of the primary outcome for changes in sys- tolic, diastolic, or mean arterial pressure did not appre- ciably affect the outcome results. Therefore, the cardiovascular benefit, and particularly the stroke bene- fit, seen with losartan over atenolol supports a BP-inde- pendent effect of this angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker in high-risk hypertensive patients. Treatment of Hypercholesterolemia Although epidemiological studies have not established as clear a link between serum cholesterol and stroke as they have for cholesterol and MI (Thomas et al ., 1966), this failure may be due to several study limitations. A meta-analysis of 45 prospective observational cohorts, including 450,000 subjects and 13,000 strokes, found no association between total cholesterol and stroke (1995). The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) (Iso et al ., 1989) did find a positive association between serum cholesterol levels and death from nonhemorrhagic stroke in men 35 to 57 years old, but also found a nega- tive association between intracranial hemorrhage and serum cholesterol levels <160 mg/dl (4.1 mmol/L) in hypertensive men. Several possible explanations have been proposed for why the observational studies to date have failed to show a clear association between choles- terol and stroke. The primary limitation of these studies has been that the cohorts of patients have not been rep- resentative of the population at risk for ischemic stroke (Amarenco, 2001). The studies focused on middle-aged subjects at risk for MI, when the incidence of stroke is known to rise one to two decades later than coronary heart disease (CHD). When strokes do occur in this younger population, the cause is less likely due to atherothrombosis and instead is more commonly due to causes unrelated to cholesterol such as heart valve dis- ease or carotid/vertebral artery dissection. In many stud- ies the strokes were not differentiated by subtype to possibly detect an association between cholesterol and ischemic atherthrombotic strokes separated from hemor- rhagic or cardioembolic strokes (Amarenco, 2001). 26 Advances in the Acute Treatment and Secondary Prevention of Stroke Ch02.qxd 9/1/04 6:29 AM Page 26"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Despite the lack of epidemiological evidence to con- firm cholesterol as a marker for stroke risk, several land- mark trials have demonstrated a beneficial effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (“statins”) in reducing stroke risk in patients with CHD. Statins inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. By inhibiting this enzyme, statins lead to an up regulation in the expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on hepato- cytes and therefore enhanced clearance of circulating LDL (Hess et al ., 2000). However, beyond lowering serum cho- lesterol levels, statins possess additional mechanisms of action that may contribute to their beneficial effects in stroke and may be independent of cholesterol-lowering effects (Table 2.2). Statins have antithrombotic effects by blocking platelet activation and increasing endothelial cell fibrinolytic activity. They have anti-inflammatory effects by blocking macrophages, reducing matrix metallopro- teinase secretion, lowering levels of C-reactive protein, and inhibiting the activation of inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, they decrease smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation and, in vitro, induce vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis, which may be one of the mecha- nisms by which statins reduce intima-media wall thickness in patients with carotid atherosclerosis (Hess et al ., 2000). A meta-analysis of the 13 randomized, placebo-con- trolled, double-blind trials of statins reporting on stroke from 1980 to 1996 found an overall stroke risk reduction of 31% (Blauw et al ., 1997). The mean age in these trials ranged from 55 to 68 years. This analysis included the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) (1994) in which 4444 patients with CHD and a mean total choles- terol of 263 mg/dl were randomized to simvastatin or placebo. In a post-hoc analysis, there was found to be a 28% RRR for fatal and nonfatal strokes or transient ischemic attacks (Pedersen et al ., 1998). The meta-analy- sis also included the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) trial (Sacks et al ., 1996), which was a random- ized, controlled trial of pravastatin in 4159 patients with recent MI and average cholesterol levels (mean total cho- lesterol 209 mg/dl, mean LDL 139 mg/dl). The treatment group had a 31% RRR (incidence 2.6% vs 3.8%) of stroke, a prespecified endpoint of the trial. There was a treatment-associated reduction across all stroke sub- types, although there was a small number of outcome events in each subtype (Plehn et al ., 1999). There was also no increase in intracerebral hemorrhages with pravastatin, although there were only eight hemorrhagic events (Plehn et al ., 1999). The Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease (LIPID) study (The Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) Study Group, 1998) was published after the pre- viously mentioned meta-analysis but supported the findings of both the meta-analysis and the 4S and CARE trials. LIPID was a randomized, controlled trial of pravastatin in 9014 patients with CHD, with a somewhat broader range of total cholesterol levels (range 155 to 271 mg/dl). There was a 19% RRR for total stroke, with a 23% RRR for ischemic stroke (incidence 3.4% vs 4.4%) and a consistent effect across all ischemic stroke sub- types. Again, there was no increase in intracerebral hem- orrhage, although the total number of hemorrhagic events (28) was too small to draw any conclusions (White et al ., 2000). The most recent clinical evidence establishing the ben- efit of lipid modification for stroke prevention in high- risk patients is the Heart Protection Study (2002), which reported its results of a randomized, controlled trial of simvastatin in 20,536 patients with vascular risk factors. This study further established that there are benefits irre- spective of initial cholesterol concentrations. Subjects included men and women 40 to 80 years old (28% older than age 70) with total cholesterol ≥ 135 mg/dl (3.5 mmol/L), and a history of CHD, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes. There was a 25% RRR (4.3% vs 5.7%) for first stroke, primarily resulting from a 30% RRR in ischemic stroke (2.8% vs 4%). There was no dif- ference in the incidence of hemorrhagic strokes, with a total of 104 hemorrhagic stroke events. Because approxi- mately one sixth of the treatment group stopped taking statin therapy and one sixth of the placebo group initiated a statin during the study, the ITT analysis actually reflects the effects of about two thirds of the treated group actu- ally taking simvastatin. Therefore, the actual reduction in stroke rate may be greater than the 25% RRR seen in the study. Furthermore, this benefit was additive to the other preventive treatments continued during the study includ- ing antiplatelet and antihypertensive agents.

There was also no lower thresh- old seen below which lowering cholesterol did not reduce risk. Even among subjects with “normal” LDL levels of <100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/L), reducing the average LDL to 65 mg/dl (1.7 mmol/L) in the treated group was safe and resulted in a risk reduction similar to those with higher LDL levels. These large clinical trials definitively establish that middle-aged and older high-risk patients achieve sub- stantial benefit in ischemic stroke risk reduction with statin therapy, specifically pravastatin and simvastatin, even with normal or moderate baseline cholesterol levels. Based on these studies, statins do not appear to increase hemorrhagic stroke incidence, although the total number of observed hemorrhagic events has been small. Most of these studies have focused on patients with CHD rather than those with primarily cerebrovascular disease. The Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction of Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial (Amarenco, 1999) has been designed to determine whether aggressive choles- terol-lowering therapy with atorvastatin, 80 mg, can reduce the incidence of stroke in patients without CHD but with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. This first prospective study of statins in secondary stroke prevention is currently ongoing. A neuroprotective mechanism of statins has been described (Endres et al ., 1998). Mediated by up regula- tion of endothelial nitric oxide synthase rather than by the decrease in cholesterol levels, infarct size in mice with normal cholesterol levels who were pretreated with sim- vastatin was significantly reduced. This protection may be related to enhanced blood flow or inhibition of platelet aggregation or leukocyte adhesion, all known nitric oxide-mediated effects. The prophylactic use of statins to decrease the severity of ischemic injury deserves further investigation. Antiplatelet Therapy: Dipyridamole In the quest to improve the effectiveness of antiplatelet therapy beyond aspirin in secondary stroke prevention, dipyridamole has been investigated alone and in combination with aspirin. It was initially thought that the antithrombotic effects of dipy- ridamole were purely platelet-mediated via phosphodi- esterase inhibition. However, early platelet aggregometry studies, which separated platelets from other blood cells, showed only weak antiplatelet effects of dipy- ridamole (Eisert, 2001a, 20 01b). The development of whole-blood impedance aggregometry, which better approximates in vivo thrombus formation, demonstrated that dipyridamole inhibits platelet aggrega tion more effectively in whole blood than in platelet-rich plasma. This suggested that dipyridamole had addi- tional antithrombotic mechanisms beyond its direct antiplatelet effects. Other newer laboratory techniques have corroborated this hypothesis. A process was devel- oped to create a subendothelial matrix covered with endothelial cells to simulate the vascular environment. With this model, dipyridamole has been found to enhance the indirect (near-field) antithrombotic action of the endothelium through multiple possible mecha- nisms (Eisert, 2001a, 2001b). These mechanisms include the inhibition of the uptake of adenosine, a potent endogenous inhibitor of platelet aggregation; potentiation of endogenous prostacyclin, a potent antithrombotic substance released from the vessel wall; and enhancement of endothelium-derived relaxing fac- tor or nitric oxide, an inhibitor of platelet aggregation and adhesion as well as a vasodilator (Eisert, 2001a and b). Dipyridamole also has antioxidant properties that may contribute to its benefit in atherosclerosis (Eisert, 2001b) (Figure 2.2). Early clinical studies of dipyridamole as an antiplatelet agent were discouraging. The Antiplatelet Trialists’ Collaboration (1994) performed a meta-analy- sis of 14 trials that compared the combination of dipy- ridamole and aspirin vs aspirin alone for prevention of nonfatal stroke, nonfatal MI, or vascular death. They found that dipyridamole provided no additional reduc- tion in vascular events (316/2661 with aspirin plus dipyridamole vs 312/2656 with aspirin alone), but they concluded that a moderate difference had not been excluded by the studies. The European Stroke Prevention Study (ESPS-1) compared aspirin (325 mg three times a day) plus dipyridamole standard-release formulation (75 mg three times a day) with placebo in patients with previous transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke and demonstrated a 38% relative risk reduction of recurrent stroke (33% RRR in stroke or death) (ESPS-1, 1987). However, ESPS-1 did not compare the combina- tion of dipyridamole plus aspirin to aspirin alone. The results of ESPS-2, reported in 1996, were consistent with ESPS-1 and it was the first study to demonstrate a sig- nificant benefit of dipyridamole plus aspirin over aspirin alone (Diener et al ., 1996). It was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial involving 6602 patients with prior TIA or stroke within the preceding three months. It compared aspirin (25 mg twice a day) plus modified-release dipyridamole (200 mg twice a day) to each medication alone and to placebo. The combina- tion of dipyridamole plus aspirin achieved a 37% RRR in recurrent stroke over placebo and a 23% RRR in recurrent stroke (3% absolute risk reduction) over aspirin alone. Why was the ESPS-2 trial able to demon- strate a significant benefit of combination therapy 28 Advances in the Acute Treatment and Secondary Prevention of Stroke Ch02.qxd 9/1/04 6:29 AM Page 28"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Advances in the Acute Treatment and Secondary Prevention of Stroke 29 dipyridamole plus aspirin while the previous 14 trials analyzed by the Antiplatelet Trialists’ Collaboration had not? One important factor may be the limited number of events captured in those earlier trials: 142 nonfatal strokes compared to the 323 nonfatal strokes in ESPS-2 alone (Wilterdink and Easton, 1999). Furthermore, the Antiplatelet Trialists’ Collaboration compared the reduction in combined vascular events (stroke, MI, and vascular death). When one excludes the trials in which no strokes occurred or in which stroke outcomes were not studied, data from the remaining nine trials com- bined favor dipyridamole plus aspirin over aspirin alone for prevention of nonfatal stroke, although results were not statistically significant (Wilterdink and Easton, 1999). The total number of nonfatal strokes in the other nine trials was 142; therefore, the 323 strokes in ESPS-2 provides more than twice as much outcome data as those previous nine trials combined. ESPS-2 was the only one of the trials discussed to use the sustained-release formu- lation, which provides better absorption of dipyridamole and allows twice-a-day (rather than three to four times per day) dosing. FUTURE DIRECTIONS Direct Thrombin Inhibitors With respect to oral anticoagulation therapy, the armamentarium to date has been limited to warfarin and related vitamin K antagonists, which limit the synthesis of γ -glutamyl carboxylated forms of coagulation factors, factors II, VII, IX, X, protein C, and protein S, thereby impairing their function (Elg et al ., 1999). Clinicians are intimately familiar with the limitations of warfarin including its narrow therapeutic window—a doubling of the dose of warfarin in an arterial thr ombosis model in rats increased the antithrombotic effect of warfarin from 23% to 81%—and its large individual patient variability in effect, necessitating close monitoring and dose adjust ments.

Low-molecular-weight direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., melagatran and inogatran) are under investigation as alternative oral anticoagulants. These agents are direct inhibitors of thrombin; therefore, they inhibit only one fac- tor in the coagulation cascade, the final common pathway for fibrin formation. A rat arterial thrombosis model demonstrated shallow dose- and plasma concentration- response curves for the direct thrombin inhibitors (for the purposes of the experiment they were administered as con- tinuous infusions) vs the steeper curve for warfarin. It has been suggested that the dose-response curves for each indi- vidual factor will superimpose on each other, resulting in a steeper dose-response curve and thus the narrow therapeu- tic window exhibited by warfarin (Elg et al ., 1999). Bleeding complications are a constant concern in the clinical use of anticoagulants. A tail transection bleeding time experiment in a rat model showed significant pro- longation of the bleeding time for heparin and warfarin at the doses necessary to achieve an 80% antithrombotic effect, while melagatran did not prolong the bleeding time (Elg et al ., 1999). Bleeding time for melagatran did not increase until twice the dose necessary to achieve an 80% antithrombotic effect, suggesting a wider therapeu- tic window. With regard to laboratory assays, there was little prolongation of activated prothrombin time and prothrombin time with melagatran treatment in the rat model despite therapeutic antithrombotic effect. Instead, thrombin time was the assay prolonged in a dose- dependent manner with melagatran treatment. With parenteral or oral administration of melagatran, therapeutic effect is achieved within minutes to hours (Bredberg, 1999). Whereas parenteral administration pro- vides complete bioavailability and low variability, oral administration does not. To overcome this obstacle and optimize the gastrointestinal absorption of melagatran, the first prodrug direct thrombin inhibitor was developed (Gustafsson et al ., 2001). The prodrug is uncharged at intes- tinal pH and 170 times more lipophilic than melagatran and, as a result, has much greater bioavailability and lower vari- ability; therefore, the pharmacodynamic benefits of melaga- tran are preserved. In addition, the minimal antithrombin effects of the prodrug against thrombin should decrease the risk of major bleeding in patients with undiagnosed gas- trointestinal bleeding (Gustafsson et al ., 2001). The melagatran prodrug, called ximelagatran, is cur- rently being investigated in two long-term Phase III human clinical trials for stroke prevention (SPORTIF III and V: Stroke Prevention Using Oral Thrombin Inhibitor in Atrial Fibrillation) (Halperin, 2003b). Enrolled patients have atrial fibrillation and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. SPORTIF III is a randomized, open-label, parallel- group study with blinded event assessment involving 3407 patients in 23 countries; SPORTIF V is similar but with double-blind treatment allocation involving 3922 patients in North America. Given the established impressive effi- cacy of warfarin in stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fi brillation (68% relative risk reduction in one meta-analysis) (Atrial Fibrillation Investigator, 1994), the objective of the phase III SPORTIF trials is to establish the noninferiority of ximelagatran relative to warfarin in this patient population. The safety and effi- cacy of fixed-dose ximelagatran (36 mg twice a day) are being compared with dose-adjusted warfarin (INR 2.0- 3.0) with the primary endpoint being the incidence of all strokes and systemic embolic events. Results of SPORTIF III were recently presented (Halperin 2003a). In the ITT analysis, 56 primary events occurred in the warfarin group (2.3% per year) and 40 occurred in the ximelagatran group (1.6% per year). This relative risk reduction of 29% and absolute risk reduction of 0.7% per year showed ximelagatran’s noninferiority relative to warfarin. There was also no significant difference between the two agents in the event rate for intracranial hemorrhage or major bleed- ing. Results of SPORTIF V have not yet been reported. Should they confirm the findings of SPORTIF III, one would anticipate that ximelagatran will become first- line treatment for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. Neuroprotectives Despite the available antiplatelet, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering agents for stroke prevention, as well as thrombolytic therapy for acute stroke treatment, min- imizing ischemic injury during a stroke remains an important challenge. Although several neuroprotective drugs have been successfully developed in stroke animal models (Sydserff et al ., 1995; Lesage et al ., 1996), human clinical trials have been disappointing. What les- sons can be learned from the shortcomings of the nega- tive clinical trials when designing future neuroprotective trials? Time Window Although animal studies have involved drug adminis- tration before or soon after the onset of ischemia, none of the clinical trials published between 1995 and 1999 enrolled patients within 3 hours of symptom onset (Kidwell et al ., 2001). In fact, the median time to entry was 12 hours, with a median time to treatment of 14 hours. To maximize the chances for detecting a treatment benefit, the time window should be as soon as possible after stroke onset and should reflect data from preclinical models. 30 Advances in the Acute Treatment and Secondary Prevention of Stroke Ch02.qxd 9/1/04 6:29 AM Page 30"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Dose and Duration As with the selection of time window, the drug dose chosen should reflect data from the preclinical and pre- liminary human studies. In some instances, the dose of a neuroprotective drug found to be effective in animals may be associated with adverse effects in clinical applica- tion. This can lead to suboptimal dosing to avoid even potentially acceptable side effects and result in a negative clinical trial (De Keyser et al ., 1999). In general, Phase II trials have been inadequately designed to determine the most likely effective and safe doses to focus on in Phase III trials. Optimal duration of treatment for neuropro- tective drugs is also not well established. Side effects can limit treatment duration. Based on evidence such as the prolonged elevation of excitatory amino acids after stroke in some patients (Bullock et al ., 1995) and mag- netic resonance spectroscopy suggesting ongoing neu- ronal loss over many days after stroke (Saunders et al ., 1995), an extended treatment duration may be required (Gladstone et al ., 2002). Certain drugs such as NMDA antagonists, benzodiazepines, or barbiturates may be beneficial if given early after ischemia but may impair recovery if given late (Gladstone et al ., 2002). This issue will need to be addressed on an individual drug or drug class basis. Stroke Standardization Animal stroke models usually involve young, healthy animals with a middle cerebral artery occlusion, while neuroprotective clinical trials have typically enrolled a variety of stroke subtypes of varying severity (Gladstone et al ., 2002). Depending on the mechanism of action, some drugs may have more of an effect on cortical than on white matter infarcts, or vice versa. Furthermore, in strokes in certain territories and of an intermediate sever- ity, one may be more likely to be able to detect and mea- sure benefit (Gladstone et al ., 2002; Grotta, 2002). Perhaps the use of advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance diffusion and perfusion- weighted imaging can be used to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from acute stroke therapies. Combination Therapies Most likely the future use of neuroprotective drugs in acute ischemic stroke will be in the setting of combination therapy, such as two neuroprotective agents with syner- gistic mechanisms of action, the use of thrombolytic ther- apy preceded and/or followed by neuroprotection, the use of two or more agents during different therapeutic windows, or the use of a neuroprotective with nonphar- macological interventions such as hypothermia (De Keyser et al ., 1999; Gladstone et al ., 2002; Grotta, 2002). Although these trials will require increased complexity in design and conduct, they offer the potential to demon- strate efficacy with lower drug doses and therefore decreased toxicity and adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS We have illustrated the developments of several recent advances in acute stroke treatment and secondary stroke prevention. Clearly, the ability to effectively treat a patient having an acute stroke and reverse the neurologi- cal deficit can be dramatic and rewarding. The use of IV tPA has empowered physicians when they encounter eli- gible stroke patients. To expand our treatment abilities, many avenues remain open for exploration including neuroimaging for patient selection, neurointerventional techniques, and neuroprotectants. To diminish stroke risk, aggressive control of traditional risk factors contin- ues to be the key element, and it is in the treatment of these risk factors that we are elucidating some of the mechanisms underlying cerebrovascular disease such as inflammation. Elucidating mechanisms that allow tradi- tional therapies, such as antihypertensives and choles- terol-lowering agents to provide additional vascular protective effects will lead to the development of more effective pharmacological agents. Continued clinical investigations will enable us to build on our current suc- cesses treating and preventing stroke and its long-term effects. References Albers GW et al. (2000).

In most cases of mod- erate or severe TBI, and in many mild cases, the neuro- logical, economic, and social consequences are devastating to the patient, his or her family, and to soci- ety as a whole. In the United States, there are approxi- mately 1.2 million TBIs that occur yearly, of which about 58,000 are severe (Glasgow Coma Score = 3 to 8) and 64,000 moderate (Glasgow Coma Score = 9 to 12). In the case of SCI, there are about 11,000 each year in the United States. Although TBI and SCI can victimize active individuals at any age, most occur in young adults in the second and third decades of life. Those who sur- vive their initial injuries can now expect to live long lives as a result of improvements in medical and surgical care. Nevertheless, the need for intensive rehabilitation and prolonged disability exacts a significant toll on the indi- vidual, his or her family, and society. Effective ways of maintaining or recovering function could markedly improve the outlook for those with TBI or SCI by enabling higher levels of independence and productivity. The potential for pharmacological intervention to preserve neurological function after TBI and SCI exists because most of the neurodegeneration that follows these injuries is not due to the primary mechanical insult (i.e., shearing of blood vessels and nerve cells) but rather to secondary injury events. For instance, most SCIs do not involve actual physical transection of the cord, but rather the spinal cord is damaged as a result of a contusive, compressive, or stretch injury. Some residual white mat- ter, containing portions of the ascending sensory and descending motor tracts, remains intact, which allows for the possibility of neurological recovery. During the first minutes and hours after injury, however, a secondary degenerative process is initiated by the primary mechani- cal injury that is proportional to the magnitude of the initial insult. Nevertheless, the anatomical continuity of the injured spinal cord in the majority of cases, together with our present knowledge of many of the factors involved in the secondary injury process, has led to the notion that pharmacological treatments that interrupt the secondary cascade, if applied early, could improve spinal cord tissue survival and thus preserve the neces- sary anatomical substrates for functional recovery to take place. Similarly, the outcome after TBI is mainly determined by the extent of the potentially treatable secondary pathophysiology and neurodegeneration. PATHOGENESIS OF SECONDARY POSTTRAUMATIC CNS INJURY Overview Several reviews of post-TBI or SCI secondary injury have been published to which the reader is referred (Anderson and Hall, 1993; Faden, 1997; Faden and Salzman, 1992; Hall, 1995; Hall and Braughler, 1989; McIntosh et al ., 1997; McIntosh and Raghupathi, 1997; Tator and Fehlings, 1991). Figure 3.1 displays the key players and the complex interrelationships involved in the secondary cascade of events occurring during the first minutes, hours, and days after traumatic central nervous system (CNS) injury. The most immediate event is mechanically induced depolarization and the 35 CHAPTER 3 Preserving Function in Acute Nervous System Injury Edward D. Hall, PhD Patrick G. Sullivan, PhD Ch03.qxd 9/2/04 11:05 AM Page 35"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"consequent opening of voltage-dependent ion channels (i.e., Na + ,K + ,Ca ++ ). This leads to massive release of a variety of neurotransmitters including glutamate, which can cause the opening of glutamate receptor-operated ion channels (e.g., NMDA, AMPA). The most impor- tant consequence of these rapidly evolving ionic distur- bances is the accumulation of intracellular Ca ++ (i.e., Ca ++ overload), which initiates several damaging effects. The first of these is mitochondrial dysfunction, which leads to a failure of aerobic energy metabolism, shift to glycolytic (i.e., anaerobic) metabolism, and the accumu- lation of lactate. The second is activation of mitochon- drial and cytoplasmic nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and nitric oxide production. The third is activation of phos- pholipase A 2 , which liberates arachidonic acid (AA), which is then converted by cyclooxygenases (COX 1, 2) to a number of deleterious prostanoids. These include the potent vasoconstrictor prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF 2 α ) and the vasoconstrictor/platelet aggregation promoter thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ). In addition, activated lipoxy- genases lead to an increase in tissue leukotrienes (LTs), some of which are chemoattractants for polymorphonu- clear leukocyte (PMN) and macrophage influx. The fourth consequence of intracellular Ca ++ overload is the activation of the calcium-activated protease calpain, which degrades a variety of cellular substrates including cytoskeletal proteins. One of the by-products of mitochondrial dysfunc- tion, COX and lipoxygenase activity, and NOS activa- tion is the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including peroxynitrite (PON; ONOO − ). Peroxynitrite is a product of the reaction of superoxide and nitric oxide radicals. Although PON can trigger cellular dam- age by a variety of mechanisms, cell membrane (plasma and organellar) lipid peroxidation (LP) has been conclu- sively demonstrated to be a key mechanism (Braughler and Hall, 1989; Hall, 1995; Hall and Br aughler, 1989, 1993). However, iron is a powerful catalyst that acceler- ates the propagation of LP reactions. Glycolytically derived lactate promotes LP by stimulating the release of iron from storage sites (e.g., ferritin). In addition, primary and secondary petechial hemorrhages supply hemoglobin-bound iron. Lipid peroxidation occurs in neurons and blood vessels, directly impairing neuronal and axonal membrane function and integrity and caus- ing microvascular damage and secondary ischemia that indirectly contribute to the secondary neuronal injury. Trauma-induced release of endogenous opiates, espe- cially dynorphin A, exacerbates the secondary injury process by stimulating NMDA receptors and by activat- ing opiate receptors, the latter contributing to vascular dysfunction and ionic and metabolic disturbances (Faden, 1997; Faden and Holaday, 1981; Faden and Salzman, 1992). 36 Preserving Function in Acute Nervous System Injury FIGURE 3.1 Pathophysiology of secondary injury in the injured central nervous system.

As implied previously, the key issue in predicting recovery of function is the degree of preservation of the ascending and descending white mat- ter tracts. Many of the axons that do survive, however, do not conduct impulses as a result of posttraumatic demyelination. Therefore, the goal of neuroprotective pharmacotherapy is to preserve as many of the white matter axons and as much of their investing myelin as possible. In TBI, a key determinant in neurological recovery is also the loss of axons. Based on the often widespread loss of axons in the injured brain, this phe- nomenon is referred to as diffuse axonal injury. It should be realized, however, that a significant factor in influenc- ing the extent of neural injury both in TBI and SCI is a decrease in brain or spinal cord microvascular perfusion (i.e., secondary ischemia). When this occurs, the result is an exacerbation of the injury process resulting from superimposed tissue ischemic hypoxia. Moreover, defi- ciencies in CNS hypoperfusion can be aggravated by sys- temic hypotension and/or hypoxia. Thus, it is important to note that secondary injury involves both neuronal and microvascular events. Role of Reactive Oxygen-Induced Oxidative Damage There is compelling experimental support for an important role of ROS in the pathophysiology of acute TBI and SCI. Kontos and colleagues showed an almost immediate postinjury increase in brain microvascular superoxide radical production, together with a com- promise of autoregulatory function in fluid percussion TBI models (Kontos and Povlishock, 1986; Kontos and Wei, 1986). Scavengers of superoxide radical (O 2 − ) reduce the posttraumatic superoxide levels and protect against the loss of autoregulatory competency. Using the salicylate trapping method, a rise in brain hydroxyl radical ( . OH) levels has also been documented in mouse diffuse and rat focal TBI models (Globus et al ., 1995; Hall and Braughler, 1993; Hall et al ., 1994; Smith et al ., 1994). As with the work of Kontos, the cerebral microvasculature appears to be the initial source of posttraumatic radical production. More recent work shows that a major source of posttrau- matic brain radical production is increased ROS leak- age from injury brain mitochondria (Azbill et al ., 1997; Matsushita and Xiong, 1997; Sullivan et al ., 1999a; Sullivan et al ., 1999b). Elegant microdialysis studies using salicylate trapping have also demonstrated an increase in hydroxyl radical levels in the injured rat spinal cord during the first minutes after contusion (Liu et al ., 2001). The most studied mechanism of oxidative damage in models of TBI concerns ROS-induced LP. Work using the rat focal contusion injury model has shown an increase in brain LP product (lipid hydroperoxide) levels that is measurable within 30 minutes after injury, follow- ing closely behind the increase in . OH (Smith et al ., 1994). Moreover, on the heels of the increase in LP markers, there is an opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), suggesting that the initial site of ROS-induced LP is the microvascular endothelium. Others have confirmed the posttraumatic increase in LP products in rats after focal contusion injury and its association with brain edema mechanisms (Nishio et al ., 1997). A role of LP in neu- ronal dysfunction has also been demonstrated in synap- tosomes from the injured hemisphere where an increase in LP products occurs coincidently with an impairment of glutamate and glucose uptake (Sullivan et al ., 1998). Biochemical indices of early oxygen radical reactions in the bluntly injured spinal cord (contusion or compres- sion injuries) have also been demonstrated using a vari- ety of analytical techniques (Hall and Braughler, 1993). Several years ago, Beckman and co-workers intro- duced the theory that the principal ROS involved in pro- ducing tissue injury in a variety of neurological disorders is PON (ONOO − ), which is formed by the combination of NOS-generated . NO radical and superoxide radical (Beckman, 1991). Since that time, the biochemistry of PON, which is often referred to as a reactive nitrogen species, has been clarified. PON-mediated oxidative damage is actually caused by PON decomposition prod- ucts that possess potent free radical characteristics. These are formed in one of two ways. The first involves the pro- tonation of PON to form peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH), which can undergo hemolytic decomposition to form the highly reactive nitrogen dioxide radical ( . NO 2 ) and hydroxyl radical ( . OH). Probably more important physi- ologically, PON will react with carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to form nitrosoperoxocarbonate (ONOOCO 2 ), which can decompose into . NO 2 and carbonate radical ( . CO 3 ). Figure 3.2 displays the biochemistry of PON formation as well as other iron-dependent mechanisms of oxygen radical formation. Each of the PON-derived radicals ( . OH, . NO 2 , and . CO 3 ) can initiate LP cellular damage by abstraction of an electron from a hydrogen atom bound to an allylic carbon in polyunsaturated fatty acids or cause protein carbonylation by reaction with susceptible amino acids (e.g., lysine, cysteine, arginine). Moreover, the alde- hydic LP products malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) can bind to cellular pro- teins also compromising their structural and functional integrity. 4-HNE is the more interesting of the two aldehydes in that it is itself neurotoxic (Kruman et al ., 1997). Also, .

Collectively, these oxidative mechanisms, which are summarized in Figure 3.3, underlie the demonstrated neurotoxic effects of PON reported in neuronal cell culture mod- els (Kruman et al ,. 1997; Neely et al ., 1999). Increased 3-NT has been found in injured brain (Mesenge et al ., 1998) and spinal cord (Bao and Liu, 2003) indicative of a role of PON in posttraumatic neurodegeneration. Role of Mitochondrial Dysfunction Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the post- traumatic death cascade (Finkel, 2001; Hunot and Flavell, 2001). It is clear that this is directly related to Ca ++ ions that alter mitochondrial function and increase ROS pro- duction (Kristal and Dubinsky, 1997; Mattson et al ., 1995; Nicholls and Budd, 2000; Rego et al ., 2001; Stout et al ., 1998; Verweij et al ., 1997; Wang and Thayer, 1996; Ward et al ., 2000; White and Reynolds, 1997). After TBI, loss of mitochondrial homeostasis, increased mitochondrial ROS production, and disruption of synaptic homeostasis have been shown to occur (Azbill et al ., 1997; Matsushita and Xiong, 1997; Sullivan et al ., 1999a, 1999b), implicating a pivotal role for mitochondrial dysfunction in the neu- ropathological sequelae of TBI. Of importance, several reports have solidified this theory by demonstrating that therapeutic intervention with cyclosporin A after experi- mental TBI significantly reduces mitochondrial dysfunc- tion (Sullivan et al ., 1999b) and cortical damage (Scheff and Sullivan, 1999; Sullivan et al ., 2000b, 2000c), as well as cytoskeletal changes and axonal dysfunction (Okonkwo et al ., 1999; Okonkwo and Povlishock, 1999). Further- more, maintaining mitochondrial bioenergetics by dietary supplementation with creatine has also proved effective in ameliorating neuronal cell death by reducing mitochon- drial ROS production and maintaining adenosine triphos- phate (ATP) levels after TBI (Sullivan et al ., 2000a). Evidence has begun to accumulate that the particular ROS being formed by mitochondria is PON. Nitric oxide has been shown to be present in mitochondria (Lopez- Figueroa et al ., 2000; Zanella et al ., 2002), and a mito- chondrial NOS isoform (mtNOS) has been isolated. Although probably playing a physiological role in mito- chondria, dysregulation of mitochondrial . NO genera- tion, and the aberrant production of its toxic metabolite PON, appear to play a role in many, if not all, of the major acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions (Heales et al ., 1999). Exposure of mitochondria to high Ca ++ , leads to PON generation, which in turn triggers mitochondrial Ca ++ release (i.e., limits their Ca ++ uptake or buffering capacity) (Bringold et al ., 2000). Both PON forms, ONOO − and ONOOCO 2 , have been shown to deplete mitochondrial antioxidant stores and to cause protein nitration (Valdez et al ., 2000). The relatively long half-life of PON in comparison to most other short-lived ROS also allows for mtNOS derived PON to diffuse from one cell to another. Accordingly, co-culture studies have shown that astrocyte-derived . NO (probably due to PON formation) can bring about damage to neuronal mito- chondrial respiratory complexes II, III, and IV (Stewart et al ., 2000, 2002). Figure 3.4 illustrates the source of PON formation in dysfunctional mitochondria in either the injured brain or spinal cord. As shown, O 2 − radical production is a by-product of the mitochondrial electron transport chain during ATP generation. Electrons escape from the chain and reduce O 2 to O 2 − . . Normally, cells convert 38 Preserving Function in Acute Nervous System Injury FIGURE 3.2 Biochemistry of reactive oxygen species generation and free radical formation in the injured CNS.

However, if pathophysiological insults such as mechanical trauma trigger an increase in intra- cellular Ca ++ , causing an increase in mtNOS activity and . NO liberation, PON formation is a certainty since the rate constant for reaction of . NO with O 2 − greatly exceeds the rate constant for dismutation of O 2 − by MnSOD (Beckman, 1991). PON can then damage mitochondria by tyrosine nitration and by causing LP and the production of 4-HNE that conjugates to mito- chondrial membrane proteins, impairing their function (Keller et al ., 1997a, 1997b; Mark et al ., 1997; Sullivan et al ., 1998). Such oxidative injury results in significant alterations in neuronal function. In particular, ROS induction of LP and protein oxidation products may be particularly important in SCI and TBI (Braughler et al ., 1985; Braughler and Hall, 1989, 1992; Sullivan et al ., 1998). Role of Calcium Homeostatic Dysregulation and Calpain-Mediated Cytoskeletal Degradation as a Final Common Neurodegenerative Pathway ROS-initiated oxidative damage to membrane pro- teins and lipids aggravates glutamate release and com- promises reuptake mechanisms and worsens the intracellular calcium overload by inhibition of the key mechanisms for controlling intracellular Ca ++ levels (Hall, 1998). Disruption of intracellular Ca ++ homeosta- sis is a critical issue in the secondary neurodegenerative pathophysiology of TBI. After an injurious event, there is a massive posttraumatic Ca ++ influx initially caused by depolarization-induced glutamate release and the opening of glutamate receptor-operated and voltage- dependent Ca ++ channels (Hall, 1995; McIntosh and Raghupathi, 1997). Evidence of increased intracellular Ca ++ concentrations in TBI models has been demon- strated by several laboratories using each of the main- stream rodent TBI models (Fineman et al ., 1993; McIntosh and Raghupathi, 1997; Siesjo and Bengtsson, 1989; Verity, 1992). Excessive intracellular Ca ++ accumu- lation then leads to neuronal degeneration by activation of various enzymes including proteases, kinases, phos- phatases, and phospholipases (Fineman et al ., 1993; McIntosh and Raghupathi, 1997; Siesjo and Bengtsson, 1989; Verity, 1992); induction of additional ROS release; and detrimental changes in gene expression (Bading et al ., 1993; Rink et al ., 1995; Raghupathi, 1997). The principal mechanism of posttraumatic Ca ++ - mediated neuronal injury involves the activation of the neutral proteases known as calpains (Bartus, 1997; Kampfl et al ., 1997; McCracken et al ., 1999; McIntosh and Raghupathia, 1997). When activated, calpains are known to degrade cytoskeletal proteins, receptor proteins, signal transduction enzymes, and transcrip- tion factors (Kampfl et al ., 1997; Yuen, 1996). In the case of cytoskeleton proteins, α -spectrin (a 280 kDa protein that provides structural support to membranes) can be cleaved by calpain at tyrosine 1176 to yield a 150 kDa fragment (SBDP150) or at glycine 1230 to yield a 145 kDa fragment (SBDP145) (Harris and Morrow, 1988).

This is consistent with the notion that cytoskeletal damage is the final common mecha- nism of posttraumatic neurodegeneration. Therefore, its inhibition is a meaningful biochemical measure of the efficacy of upstream neuroprotective strategies. However, it should also be noted that TBI-induced pro- teolysis of the cytoskeleton can be mediated by caspase- 3 activation (Pike et al ., 1998; Rink et al ., 1995; Yakovlev et al ., 1997). Multiple laboratories and studies have demon- strated an important role of calpain activation in mediating posttraumatic axonal damage in acute SCI models (Banik and Shields, 2000; Ray et al ., 2001a, 2001b, 2002, 2003; Shields et al ., 2000; Wingrave et al ., 2003; Zhang et al ., 2003). Several of these studies have reported neuroprotective efficacy of prototype calpain inhibitors. However, the translation of calpain inhibi- tion into neuroprotective clinical trials has been pre- cluded by the lack of small molecule inhibitors with sufficient CNS penetration and appropriate pharma- ceutical and pharmacokinetic properties. Figure 3.5 shows a schematic integration of posttraumatic cal- cium accumulation triggered mitochondrial dysfunc- tion, reactive oxygen generation, calcium overload, calpain activation, cytoskeletal degradation, and neurodegeneration. DEVELOPMENT OF NEUROPROTECTIVE PHARMACOTHERAPY FOR SPINAL CORD INJURY Early Use of Glucocorticoid Steroids The glucocorticoid steroids, mainly dexamethasone and methylprednisolone, were extensively used in the clinical treatment of spinal cord trauma beginning in the mid 1960s and throughout the 1970s. The mechanistic rationale for their use initially centered on the expectation that they would reduce posttraumatic spinal cord edema. This notion was based on the rather remarkable reduction of peritu- moral brain edema that glucocorticoids can induce in brain tumor patients (Reulen and Schurmann, 1972). Furthermore, steroid pretreatment became a standard of care before neurosurgical procedures to prevent intraopera- tive and postoperative brain swelling. A limited amount of experimental evidence supported the possibility that gluco- corticoid dosing in animal SCI models might be neuropro- tective (Reulen and Schurmann, 1972). NASCIS I Clinical Trial In the mid-1970s, a randomized, multicenter clinical trial was organized to try to determine if steroid dosing was ben- eficial in improving neurological recovery in humans after SCI. This trial was named the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS I). It compared the efficacy of “low- dose” methylprednisolone (100 mg intravenous bolus/day for 10 days) and “high-dose” methylprednisolone (1000 mg intravenous bolus/day for 10 days) in affecting outcome after SCI (Bracken et al ., 1984, 1985). The trial, which began in 1979, did not involve a placebo group because of the prevailing belief that glucocorticoid dosing probably was beneficial and could not be ethically withheld; however, results failed to show any difference between the low- and high-dose groups at either 6 months (Bracken et al ., 1984) or 1 year (Bracken et al ., 1985). Based on this result, the investigators concluded that steroid dosing was of little ben- efit. Also, there was a suggestion that the 10-day high-dose regimen increased the risk of infections, a predictable side effect of sustained glucocorticoid dosing. Based on the neg- ative results of NASCIS I, as well as waning neurosurgical enthusiasm for steroid treatment of CNS injury in general, the majority of neurosurgeons concluded after NASCIS I that the conventional use of steroids in the acute manage- ment of spinal trauma was not beneficial while at the same time being fraught with the potential for serious side effects.

Attention was focused on the hypothet- ical possibility that glucocorticoid steroids might be effective inhibitors of posttraumatic LP based on their high lipid solubility and known ability to intercalate into artificial membranes between the hydrophobic polyun- saturated fatty acids of the membrane phospholipids and to thereby limit the propagation of LP chain reactions throughout the phospholipid bilayer (Demopoulos et al ., 1980; Hall, 1992; Hall and Braughler, 1981, 1982). The lead author and his colleagues became interested in the LP hypothesis of secondary SCI during parallel investigations of the effects of high-dose methylpred- nisolone (MP) (15 to 90 mg/kg IV) on spinal cord elec- trophysiology, as those might serve to improve impulse conduction and recovery of function in the injured spinal cord (Hall, 1982). Consequently, it was decided to test the possibility that a similar high dose of MP, which enhanced spinal neuronal excitability and impulse trans- mission, might also be required to inhibit posttraumatic spinal cord LP. In an initial set of experiments in cats, it was observed that the administration of an IV bolus of MP could indeed inhibit posttraumatic LP in spinal cord tissue (Hall and Braughler, 1981), but the doses required for this effect were much higher (30 mg/kg) than previ- ously hypothesized or than those empirically used in the clinical treatment of acute CNS injury or tested in the NASCIS trial. Further experimental studies, also con- ducted in cat SCI models, showed that the 30-mg/kg dose of MP not only prevented LP, but in parallel inhibited posttraumatic spinal cord ischemia (Hall et al ., 1984; Young and Flamm, 1982), supported aerobic energy metabolism (i.e., reduced lactate and improved ATP and energy charge) (Anderson et al ., 1982; Braughler and Hall, 1983a, 1984), improved recovery of extracellular calcium (i.e., reduced intracellular overload) (Young and Flamm, 1982), and attenuated calpain-mediated neurofil- ament loss (Braughler and Hall, 1984). However, the cen- tral effect in this protective scenario is the inhibition of posttraumatic LP (Figure 3.6). With many of these thera- peutic parameters (LP, secondary ischemia, aerobic energy metabolism), the dose-response for MP follows a sharp U-shaped pattern (Figure 3.7). The neuroprotective and vasoprotective effect is partial with a dose of 15 mg/kg, optimal at 30 mg/kg, and diminishes at higher doses (60 mg/kg) (Hall, 1992). The antioxidant neuroprotective action of MP is closely linked to the drug’s tissue pharmacokinetics (Braughler and Hall, 1982, 1983a, 1983b; Hall, 1992). For instance, when MP tissue levels are at their peak after administration of a 30 mg/kg IV dose, lactate levels in the injured cord are suppressed. When tissue MP levels decline, spinal tissue lactate rises (Figure 3.8).

This finding prompted the hypothesis that prolonged MP therapy might better suppress the secondary injury process and lead to better outcomes compared to the effects of a sin- gle large IV dose. Indeed, subsequent experiments in a cat spinal injury model demonstrated that animals treated with MP, using a 48-hour antioxidant dosing reg- imen, had improved recovery of motor function over 4 weeks (Anderson et al ., 1985; Braughler et al ., 1987). Table 3.1 summarizes the neuroprotective pharmacology of high-dose MP derived from acute SCI models. The preclinical studies defining the antioxidant neuro- protective pharmacology showing that high-dose MP could exert antioxidant and related neuroprotective effects were conducted in cat models of blunt (nontran- secting) SCI, which were the standard in the experimental SCI field before the 1990s. Since that time, rat contusion and compression models have become the standard, and several investigators have tested the ability of high-dose MP (usually 30 mg/kg IV as a starting dose) to lessen posttraumatic pathophysiology and neurodegeneration and/or to improve neurological recovery. Several of these studies have replicated in some fashion the neuroprotec- tive properties of MP in the injured rat spinal cord. Specifically, high-dose MP has been reported in rat SCI models to attenuate posttraumatic LP (Taoka et al ., 2001), decrease lactate accumulation (Farooque et al ., 1996), prevent hypoperfusion (Holtz et al ., 1990), attenu- ate vascular permeability (Xu et al ., 1992), decrease inflammatory markers (Xu et al ., 2001), and improve neu- rological recovery (Behrmann et al ., 1994; Holtz et al ., 1990), reminiscent of similar effects shown earlier in cat models (Hall, 1992; Hall and Braughler, 1982). In con- trast, failures of high-dose MP to improve neurological recovery in rat SCI models have also appeared in the lit- erature (Koyanagi and Tator, 1997; Rabchevsky et al ., 2002). Of considerable concern in the extrapolation of the cat MP dosing parameters to the rat, however, is the lack of any definition thus far of the relative pharmacokinet- ics of MP in rats. This is in striking contrast to the docu- mentation of the uptake and elimination of MP from the cat spinal cord and correlation of plasma and spinal tis- sue levels with the neuroprotective actions (Braughler and Hall, 1982, 1983a, 1983b; Hall 1992). The likelihood that the precise dose-response relationship and requirements for repeated dosing defined in cats is also optimal for the rat is exceedingly small. Thus the interpretation of rat SCI studies with MP, whether positive or negative, is difficult without the necessary pharmacokinetic correlation. Comparison of Different Glucocorticoids The early empirical treatment of peritumoral edema and acute SCI with glucocorticoid steroids was heavily weighted toward the use of dexamethasone based on the fact that it was, and is, the most potent synthetic 42 Preserving Function in Acute Nervous System Injury 0 Lactate (nmoles / mg dry wt.)

Dexamethasone is about five times more potent than MP in regard to glucocorticoid receptor affinity and anti- inflammatory potency (Schimmer and Parker, 2001). However, it has been found that the antioxidant efficacy of MP is unrelated to its glucocorticoid steroid receptor activity (Hall et al ., 1987). Indeed, a careful concentration- response study has compared the ability of different glu- cocorticoid steroids to inhibit oxygen radical-induced LP damage in rat brain synaptosomal preparations and con- firmed that LP-inhibiting potencies and anti-inflamma- tory potencies do not correlate. Although dexamethasone is five times more potent than MP as a glucocorticoid, it is only slightly more potent than MP as an inhibitor of LP (Braughler, 1985). Furthermore, the maximal antioxidant activity of MP appears to be superior to that for dexa- methasone. The prototype glucocorticoid hydrocortisone is completely lacking in ability to inhibit oxygen radical damage in CNS tissue. Thus, the choice of a steroid for its potential antioxidant neuroprotective activity should not be predicated on glucocorticoid receptor-mediated anti- inflammatory actions. In addition, selection of the most potent glucocorticoid would logically carry the greatest potential for concomitant steroid-related side effects. Neuroprotective Effects of the Opiate Receptor Antagonist Naloxone At the same time as the discovery of the neuroprotec- tive efficacy of high-dose MP in animal models of SCI, others were demonstrating the ability of the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone to improve recovery after experimental SCI. The rationale for the study of nalox- one in acute SCI models was based on its positive effects in experimental shock models (Holaday and Faden, 1981a, 1981b). Studies in cat SCI models, carried out in two separate laboratories, documented the ability of naloxone to maintain spinal cord blood flow (Flamm et al ., 1982) and to improve neurological recovery after con- tusion SCI (Faden and Holaday, 1981; Faden et al ., 1981, 1982; Flamm et al ., 1982). Furthermore, a phase I study in acute SCI patients showed that the drug was safe in that population (Flamm et al ., 1985). NASCIS II Clinical Trial The preceding experimental studies with high-dose MP and naloxone inspired the second National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS II) (Bracken et al ., 1990) even though the earlier NASCIS trial, which came to be known as NASCIS I, had failed to show any effi- cacy of lower MP doses, even when administered over 10 days (Bracken et al ., 1984, 1985). The NASCIS II trial compared 24 hours of dosing with MP or naloxone with placebo for the treatment of acute SCI. A priori trial hypotheses included the prediction that SCI patients treated within the first 8 hours after injury would respond better to pharmacotherapy than patients treated after 8 hours. Results showed the effectiveness of 24 hours of intensive MP dosing (30 mg/kg IV bolus plus a 23-hour infusion at 5.4 mg/kg per hour) when treatment was initiated within 8 hours. Significant bene- fit was observed in individuals with both neurologically Preserving Function in Acute Nervous System Injury 43 FIGURE 3.9 Comparative effects in spinal-cord-injured cats of a sin- gle 30 mg/kg IV dose of MP given at 30 minutes postinjury vs a dou- ble-dose regimen of 30 mg/kg IV at 30 minutes postinjury plus a second dose of 15 mg/kg IV at 2.5-hours postinjury on the 4-hour postinjury levels of lactate, energy charge (ATP + ADP + AMP/ADP + AMP), and neurofilament preservation (Braughler and Hall, 1984).

TABLE 3.1 Pharmacological Characteristics of High-Dose Methylprednisolone (MP) Therapy for Acute SCI Inhibition of posttraumatic lipid peroxidation appears to be the principal neuroprotective mechanism and this is unrelated to glucocorticoid receptor-mediated actions. Microvascular and neuroprotective effects are both involved. Large intravenous doses are required (30 mg/kg). Antioxidant protective effects of MP follow a biphasic (U-shaped) dose-response curve; doubling the dose from 30 to 60 mg/kg results in a loss of the protective efficacy. Early treatment is required because lipid peroxidation develops rapidly and is irreversible. Time course of antioxidant protection parallels the spinal cord tissue pharmacokinetics; there is consequently a need for constant IV infusion to maintain effective tissue concentrations. Optimal treatment duration is uncertain but needs to be continued as long as conditions within the injured spinal cord favor lipid peroxidative reactions (i.e., at least 24-48 hours). Glucocorticoid receptor-mediated anti-inflammatory effects play only a minor role compared to lipid antioxidant effects.

Moreover, the functional benefits were sustained at 6-week, 6-month, and 1-year follow-up evaluations (Bracken, 1993; Bracken and Holford, 1993; Bracken et al ., 1990, 1992). The high-dose regimen actually improved function below the level of the injury and low- ered the level of the functional injury (Bracken and Holford, 1993). Although predictable side effects of steroid therapy were noted, including GI bleeding, wound infections, and delayed healing, these were not significantly more frequent than those recorded in placebo-treated patients (Bracken et al ., 1990). Another finding was that delay in the initiation of MP treatment until after 8 hours is actually associated with decreased neurological recovery (Bracken and Holford, 1993). Thus, treatment within the 8 hour window is beneficial, whereas dosing after 8 hours may be detrimental. Possible explanations for this latter effect are discussed later. The original NASCIS II publications (Bracken et al ., 1990, 1992) stated that in contrast to the beneficial actions of high dose MP, the opiate receptor naloxone did not sig- nificantly improve the return of sensory or motor function. In a subsequent analysis, however, naloxone improved neu- rological function below the lesion in patients with incom- plete injuries (Bracken and Holford, 1993). Thus, in the case of both high-dose MP and naloxone, at least a partial validation of the positive effects of these two therapeutic approaches and compounds in animal models of SCI was achieved in the placebo-controlled NASCIS II trial. Anti-Inflammatory Effects Play a Minor Role in Methylprednisolone’s Neuroprotective Efficacy The rationale for the high-dose MP arm of the NASCIS II trial was derived from the animal studies showing that the steroid can inhibit posttraumatic LP and associated pathophysiological events (Hall, 1992). Positive effects of high-dose MP obtained in NASCIS II were at least tentatively viewed as a validation of the LP hypothesis (Bracken and Holford, 1993; Bracken et al ., 1990, 1992). However, after the publication of the NASCIS II results, it was suggested that a complete assignment of the mechanism of the MP neuroprotective effect to the inhibition of LP was premature. After all, the glucocorticoid steroid MP possesses various gluco- corticoid receptor-mediated anti-inflammatory actions that could reasonably be expected to play a neuroprotec- tive role in addition to the nonglucocorticoid LP inhibi- tion. In view of the known importance of certain prostanoids (PGF 2 α and TXA 2 ) in posttraumatic patho- physiology (Figure 3.1), it is conceivable that MP, by virtue of its phospholipase A 2 inhibitory action, might protect the injured spinal cord by inhibiting AA release, and consequently attenuating the formation of these deleterious prostanoids. In support of this possible mechanism, it has been shown that pretreatment of cats with a 30-mg/kg intravenous dose of MP does reduce posttraumatic spinal cord AA release, as well as PGF 2 α and TXA 2 formation (Anderson et al ., 1986). The assumption that this effect is due entirely to the well- known ability of glucocorticoids to inhibit phospholi- pase A 2 , however, is not tenable for three reasons. First of all, the glucocorticoid inhibition of phospholipase A 2 is mediated via the interaction of the steroid with specific glucocorticoid receptors, an action that most certainly does not require a 30-mg/kg IV dose to be fully mani- fested; much lower doses should suffice. Second, the reported spinal cord glucocorticoid receptor population (Clark et al ., 1981) involved in this activity would be sat- urated at much lower glucocorticoid doses. Third, the reduction of posttraumatic spinal cord AA release (and reduced prostanoid formation downstream) may simply be secondary to an attenuation of LP since peroxidative reactions can liberate arachidonate independent of phos- pholipase A 2 activity. In other words, the MP effect on prostanoid buildup in the injured spinal cord may be an indirect result of lessened membrane LP. Fairly convinc- ing support for this view is that pretreatment of cats with the lipid antioxidant vitamin E also reduced posttrau- matic AA liberation and accumulation of PGF 2 α and TXA 2 (Anderson et al ., 1986). Furthermore, subsequent studies showed that the administration of antioxidant neuroprotective doses of MP (i.e., 30 mg/kg IV) at 30 minutes after moderately severe compression SCI in cats did not attenuate the posttraumatic elevation in PGF 2 α or TXA 2 (Hall et al ., 1995). Therefore, it is unlikely that the protective effects of MP on the injured cord are more a reflection of the phospholipaseA 2 -inhibiting activity than its antioxidant property. Similarly, administration of neuroprotective doses of MP in a rat model of contu- sion SCI also failed to significantly reduce the infiltration of PMN into the injured cord (Xu et al ., 1992). On the other hand, another group has reported that a single high dose of MP can significantly suppress PMN and macrophage influx into the rat cord after a partial trans- action injury, although this effect was not associated with reduction of secondary neurodegeneration (Bartholdi and Schwab, 1995). Despite this confusing body of data concerning the possible involvement of anti-inflammatory mechanisms for MP neuroprotection in acute SCI, inflammatory processes play an increasingly appreciated role in post- SCI secondary injury (Popovich and Jones, 2003; Popovich et al ., 1997a). Moreover, glucocorticoid steroids, including MP, possess a wide array of anti- inflammatory mechanisms and are probably the most potent and reliable anti-inflammatory agents in the cur- rent pharmacological armamentarium (Schimmer and 44 Preserving Function in Acute Nervous System Injury Ch03.qxd 9/2/04 11:05 AM Page 44"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Parker, 2001). These facts support the possibility that par- ticular anti-inflammatory mechanisms may play some role in the MP neuroprotective activity. In that regard, high doses of MP have been more recently reported to attenuate the posttraumatic expression of the pro-inflam- matory mediators activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor κ B (NF κ B) and matrix metalloproteinase 1 and 9 in the injured spinal cord, although this study used a rel- atively mild level of injury (Xu et al ., 2001). Recently, a role of delayed influx of T cells has been suggested to be involved in secondary SCI (Popovich et al ., 1996, 1997b). Considering that glucocorticoids also suppress T-cell- mediated hypersensitivity in a variety of conditions (Schimmer and Parker, 2001), there is a strong possibility that high-dose MP may have an impact on this immune response in the injured spinal cord, although this has not been investigated in SCI models. Discovery of the Nonglucocorticoid Steroid Tirilazad Methylprednisolone is a potent glucocorticoid that possesses a number of glucocorticoid receptor-mediated anti-inflammatory actions. Despite the role of anti-inflam- matory effects of MP in the injured spinal cord, the prin- cipal neuroprotective mechanism appears to be the inhibition of posttraumatic LP that is not mediated via glucocorticoid receptor-mediated activity (Braughler et al ., 1988; Hall, 1997; Hall et al ., 1994). This prompted speculation that modifying the steroid molecule to enhance the anti-LP effect, while eliminating the steroid’s glucocorticoid effects, would result in more targeted antioxidant therapy devoid of the typical side effects of steroid therapy. This rationale led to the development of more potent LP inhibitors, the 21-aminosteroids or “lazaroids,” which lack the glucocorticoid receptor-medi- ated side effects that limit the clinical utility of high-dose MP. One of these, tirilazad, was selected for development. Figure 3.10 compares the structures of the glucocorticoid, MP, and the nonglucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid, tirilazad. Tirilazad was extensively evaluated in animal models of spinal cord injury (SCI), traumatic brain injury (TBI), ischemic stroke, and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and was shown to exert a variety of neuroprotective and vasoprotective effects (Hall, 1997; Hall et al ., 1994). Based on these preclinical studies, clinical trials of tirilazad were conducted in SCI, TBI, SAH; and ischemic stroke. NASCIS III Clinical Trial The demonstrated efficacy of a 24-hour dosing regi- men of MP in human SCI in NASCIS II (Bracken et al ., 1990) and the discovery of tirilazad (Braughler et al ., 1988; Hall, 1997; Hall et al ., 1994) led to the organization and conduct of NASCIS III (Bracken et al . 1997, 1998). In the NASCIS III trial, three groups of patients were evaluated. The first (active control) group was treated with the 24-hour MP dosing regimen that had previously been shown to be effective in NASCIS II. The second group was also treated with MP, except that the duration of MP infusion was prolonged to 48 hours. The purpose was to determine whether extension of the MP infusion from 24 to 48 hours resulted in greater improvement in neurological recovery in acute SCI patients. The third group of patients was treated with a single 30 mg/kg IV bolus of MP followed by the 48-hour administration of tirilazad. No placebo group was included because it was deemed ethically inappropriate to withhold at least the initial large bolus of MP. Another objective of the study was to ascertain whether treatment initiation within 3 hours after injury was more effective than when therapy was delayed until 3 to 8 hours after SCI. On completion of the NASCIS III trial, it was found that all three treatment arms produced comparable degrees of recovery when treatment was begun within the shorter 3-hour window. When the 24-hour dosing of MP was begun more than 3 hours after SCI, recovery was poorer in comparison to the cohort treated within 3 hours after SCI. However, in the 3-to-8-hr post-SCI cohort, when MP dosing was extended to 48 hours, sig- nificantly better recovery was observed than with the 24-hour dosing. In the comparable tirilazad cohort (3 to 8 hours post-SCI), recovery was slightly, but not signifi- Preserving Function in Acute Nervous System Injury 45 O O O H 3 C H 3 C O O N N N N N CH 3 H 3 C H 3 C N CH 3 Methylprednisolone sodium succinate Tirilazad Mesylate U-74006F HO O O − Na + OH FIGURE 3.10 Chemical structures of the glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone shown as the sodium salt of the 21-hemisuccinate ester and the nonglucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid tirilazad mesylate.

These results showed that: (1) initiation of high-dose MP treatment within the first 3 hours is optimal; (2) the nonglucocorticoid tirilazad is as effect ive as 24-hour MP therapy; and (3) if treatment is initiated more than 3 hours post-SCI, extension of the MP dosing regimen is indicated, from 24 hours to 48 hours. Compared with the 24-hour dosing regimen, however, significantly more glucocorticoid-related immunosuppression-based side effects were seen with more prolonged dosing (i.e., the incidence of severe sepsis and pneumonia signifi- cantly increased). In contrast, tirilazad showed no evi- dence of steroid-related side effects, suggesting that this nonglucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid would be safer for extension of dosing beyond the 48-hour limit used in NASCIS III (Bracken et al ., 1997, 1998). Tirilazad’s ability to improve neurological recovery in NASCIS III at least as well as MP (i.e., treatment within 3 hours after injury) while producing fewer side effects (Bracken et al ., 1997, 1998) strongly suggests that it is worthy of additional trials in acute SCI that could ulti- mately show greater efficacy and safety compared with high-dose MP. Limitations to the Use of High-Dose Methylprednisolone The use of large doses of glucocorticoid steroids in SCI patients has appropriately been referred to as a “two- edged sword” (Galandiuk et al ., 1993). This is derived from the fact that the neuroprotective properties of MP can be offset by the potential of the necessary high doses of MP to elicit glucocorticoid, receptor-mediated side effects that could compromise the neurological outcome and even the survival of acute SCI patients. This is most apparent when treatment is extended beyond the appar- ently safe limit of 24 hours demonstrated in NASCIS II. Complications of high-dose MP, including increased inci- dence of pneumonias, pressure sores, GI bleeding, and deep vein thrombosis, have also been documented when the NASCIS II dosing is used as a prophylactic neuro- protectant for spinal surgery (Molano Del Rey et al ., 2002). However, there are other glucocorticoid-related actions, that although not necessarily life-threatening, can potentially complicate the steroid’s proper usage in SCI patients and/or counteract its neuroprotective actions. 1. Biphasic (U-Shaped) Neuroprotective Dose Response: The sharp U-shaped dose-response curve for the neuro- protective properties of MP and the need for repeated dosing (i.e., continuous infusion) to maintain these effects (Hall, 1992) make the administration of MP in SCI patients difficult, and even tricky. For instance, optimal doses of MP can lessen posttraumatic anaerobic metabolism in the injured spinal cord and lessen lactate accumulation (Braughler and Hall, 1983a, 1983b, 1984). Inadequate or excessive MP dosing has been shown to aggravate posttraumatic lactate accumula tion (Br aughler and Hall, 1983a, 1983b, 1984). This is a consequence of glucocorticoid receptor-mediated gluconeogenesis stim- ulatory actions of MP and similar steroids. As a result, there is an opposition between the beneficial effects of optimal MP doses to support aerobic metabolism and to lessen lactate accumulation while nonoptimal doses can result in lactate production being enhanced via an increase in blood glucose levels. These can potentially drive up anaerobic glycolysis in the injured cord, which will aggravate, rather than inhibit, LP reactions. Thus considerable care is required in dose calculation whether it is based on body weight or mass because too little will not serve to effectively protect and too much will result in a loss of the antioxidant neuroprotection. During the last 13 post-NASCIS II years of widespread use of high- dose MP (NASCIS II 24-hour or NASCIS III 48-hour protocols), there have undoubtedly been many dose mis- calculations that have resulted in less than or more than optimal MP dosing in many SCI patients. As Bracken (2001) notes, there are only ad hoc reports of compli- ance to the 24-hour NASCIS II MP dosing protocol in routine practice; however, these include reports of ther- apy commencing later than the recommended 8-hour cutoff, discontinuation of therapy before 24 hours, acci- dental administration of the full 24-hour dose within the first hour, the maintenance infusion being at rates faster or slower than the recommended 5.4 mg/kg per hour and inaccurate estimates of patient body weight. Similarly, the first author has listened to several anec- dotes over the past several years concerning MP dose miscalculations either in regard to the magnitude of the initial bolus loading dose or the rate and duration of the maintenance infusion. The rather narrow U-shaped dose-response curve dictates that great care be taken in calculating and administering the NASCIS II or III MP protocols. Based on the experimentally determined U- shaped dose-response curve, the need for initiation of treatment as soon as possible, and the requirement for maintenance dosing to maintain the neuroprotective effects during the first 24 to 48 hours, it is likely that MP will have no benefit if the protocol is erroneously admin- istered. 2. Duration of Treatment Dependent on Treatment Initiation Time: The results of the NASCIS III study show that if treatment cannot be initiated until after the first 3 posttraumatic hours, then it would be better to extend the infusion phase of the treatment from 24 to 48 hours. On the other hand, if begun within the first 3 hours, the 24-hour NASCIS II protocol is suffi- 46 Preserving Function in Acute Nervous System Injury Ch03.qxd 9/2/04 11:05 AM Page 46"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"cient (Bracken et al ., 1997, 1998). Thus, attention to the time of injury vs treatment initiation time is an important consideration that adds a small, but signifi- cant complication to the therapy. 3. Late Treatment Initiation May Exacerbate Damage: Initiation of MP therapy beyond the 8-hour therapeu- tic window determined in NASCIS II may actually exacerbate the posttraumatic secondary injury and lessen the expected neurological outcome compared to no therapy (Bracken and Holford, 1993). Therefore, the need to take into account the exact time of injury in making the decision to treat or not to treat the SCI patient with high-dose MP is yet another complicating factor. Treatment later than 8 hours after injury should be avoided. 4. Possible Negative Effects on Neuronal Survival and Plasticity: Glucocorticoids have been repeatedly shown to inhibit axonal sprouting and synaptogenesis in various CNS areas (Scheff et al ., 1980; Scheff and Cotman, 1982; Scheff and DeKosky, 1983, 1989). Although it is not known whether these actions will occur concomitantly with the acute antioxidant neuro- protective effects, the potential of the steroid to atten- uate posttraumatic plasticity mechanisms is perhaps the most serious concern regarding the administration of high doses of MP for any longer than necessary. Although the beneficial neurological effects of 24, and even 48, hours of dosing seen in NASCIS II and III, respectively, might suggest that the antiplasticity effects are not a problem with short-term, high dose MP therapy; this possibility has not been investigated. Other neurotoxic actions documented in certain neuronal populations (e.g., hippocampus) with either physiological or pharmacological levels of glucocorti- coids (Dinkel et al ., 2003; Elliott and Sapolsky, 1992; Landfield and Eldridge, 1994; McIntosh and Sapolsky, 1996; Morse and Davis, 1990; Sapolsky, 1985; Sapolsky et al ., 1986; Shin et al ., 2001; Stein-Behrens et al ., 1992) give one pause when administering high doses of a glucocorti- coid steroid in the context of the injured CNS. Although the sensitivity of spinal cord neurons to these detrimental actions of glucocorticoids has not been specifically inves- tigated, the possibility that high-dose MP therapy may aggravate posttraumatic neuronal damage begs for fur- ther investigation. If in fact the plasticity-inhibiting and neurotoxic actions of glucocorticoids are shown to occur in the injured cord coincident with the neuroprotective antioxidant actions, this will be yet another example of how MP can constitute a “two-edged sword” in the treat- ment of acute SCI. In any event, the potential for steroid side effects, inhibition of plasticity mechanisms, and even neurotoxic actions underscores the fact that glucocorti- coids such as MP are a far from ideal approach to dealing with the posttraumatic oxidative stress and LP-related damage and consequent need for antioxidant dosing that continues beyond the first 24 to 48 hours. Despite the concerns about the potential inhibition of axonal sprouting and other neurotoxic actions of gluco- corticoids discussed previously, however, the safety and neuroprotective value of the ongoing clinical use of high doses of MP in SCI therapy is sufficiently encouraging that high doses of MP have actually been reported to lessen axonal dieback of vestibulospinal fibers and to promote their terminal sprouting in transected rat spinal cords (Oudega et al ., 1999). The same group has shown that identical high doses of MP can improve axonal regeneration into Schwann cell grafts (Chen et al ., 1996) and lessen caspase 3 activation (Li et al ., 2000) in tran- sected rat spinal cords. In regard to the latter antiapop- totic action, other laboratories have also shown the high-dose MP therapy can lessen apoptotic neurodegen- eration after traumatic (Ray et al ., 1999) or ischemic (Kanellopoulos et al ., 1997) SCI in rats. These effects were achieved with acute MP administration limited to the first 4 hours after injury. In contrast, a recent report has shown that MP can exacerbate retinal ganglion cell apoptosis in the context of autoimmune CNS inflammation (Diem et al ., 2003). Thus, the question of whether high-dose MP is neuroprotective or neurotoxic may depend on dose selection, timing and duration of administration, and the particular neuronal population in question. The Methylprednisolone SCI Controversy and Criticism of the NASCIS Trials Before completion of NASCIS II, no treatment for acute SCI had ever been demonstrated in a placebo-con- trolled clinical trial to have a beneficial effect on neurolog- ical outcome. Therefore, the revelation of the beneficial effects of high-dose MP was a surprise to many in the medical community, including some, if not all, of the NASCIS II clinical investigators. So surprising and grati- fying were the results that the NIH sanctioned a prepub- lication press release of the results to inform the neurosurgical community so that the NASCIS II MP dos- ing protocol would be immediately available to SCI patients rather than having to wait for the publication of the initial trial manuscript that had been accepted by the New England Journal of Medicine . The editorial office of the journal uncharacteristically approved the prepublica- tion release of the findings based on their view that this indeed represented a breakthrough treatment for acute SCI and it should be immediately available to SCI victims. For the NIH and the NASCIS II group to have done oth- erwise would undoubtedly have been viewed by many physicians and patients as unethical. However, the negative response of a few neurosurgeons to the idea of Preserving Function in Acute Nervous System Injury 47 Ch03.qxd 9/2/04 11:05 AM Page 47"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"publishing clinical trial results in the popular press before publication and before presentation to, and careful scrutiny by, the neurosurgical community represented the beginning of a heated controversy about the design, analy- sis, and reporting of the NASCIS II (Bracken and Holford, 1993; Bracken et al ., 1990, 1985) and later the NASCIS III (Bracken and Holford, 2002; Bracken et al ., 1997, 1998) trials. This controversy has raged off and on for the past 13 years. A few years ago, three highly critical reviews appeared in the literature concerning the NASCIS trials and the resulting view that high-dose MP therapy should be con- sidered the standard of care for acute SCI (Coleman et al ., 2000; Hurlbert, 2000; Short et al ., 2000). The first critical review (Hurlbert, 2000) was written by a single author who is a member of the “American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurolo gical Surgeons practice guidelines subcommittee for the pharmacological treat- ment of SCI.” However, he was the sole author and a Disclosure was included at the end of the article stating that “The views expressed in this paper do not represent the final consensus of the committee.” Therefore, it could be perceived that the other AANS/CNS committee members did not agree with the negative assessment of high-dose MP therapy for SCI patients. In any case, Hurlbert (2000) leveled six criticisms of the NASCIS II study. The first of these was that the overall analysis of the effects of either MP or naloxone vs placebo was negative when all patients were included in the analysis (i.e., no split of patients treated within 8 hours vs after 8 hours). The further claim was made that the stratified analysis on the basis of time to treatment was a post hoc decision. However, this was not the case in the design of NASCIS II. The rule for sub- group analysis is that if the subgroup is prespecified in the study protocol, then that becomes the primary endpoint. Indeed, the NINDS proposal that funded NASCIS II specified that two dichotomies would be studied. First of all, the effects of early vs late treatment with MP or nalox- one would be analyzed with the split being made at the median time to treatment. Secondly, an analysis of the effects of either drug would be assessed separately in incomplete and complete SCI patients (Bracken, 2001). The precise time of the data cut was not prespecified because going into the trial, there was no way to know what the median treatment initiation time would be. After the final patient was enrolled, it turned out that the 8 hours was the nearest whole number to the median treat- ment initiation time (8.5 hours), and thus 8 hours was selected for the data split (Bracken, 2001). This approach has been used and widely accepted in establishing the 3- hour cutoff for the safe and effective use of tissue plas- minogen activator in acute stroke therapy (Kwiatkowski et al ., 1999; Marler et al ., 2000). Therefore, the claim that the NASCIS II trial did not reach its primary endpoint in regard to the efficacy of MP is not consistent with the documented trial design in which the plan to look at early vs late treatment and the influence of injury severity was, in fact, preplanned. Additional criticisms of NASCIS II put forth by Hurlbert (2000) were that the MP effect sizes were small, their functional importance was uncertain due to the reliance on neurological sensory and motor assessments rather than functional improvement scales, and that effects on long tract function were not established. Each of these has been addressed by additional analyses of the NASCIS II data set carried out by Bracken and colleagues. Concerning the size of the effect, it has indeed been acknowledged that the benefits of MP in the context of NASCIS II were “modest, but [MP] does appear to have the potential to result in important clinical recovery in some patients” and “Even small changes in motor recov- ery, typically assessed in the MPSS trials on one side of the body, have the potential to be amplified into meaningful improvements in the quality of life” (Bracken, 2001). Regarding the issue of long tract vs segmental recovery effects, further analysis of the NASCIS II data revealed that the greatest degree of motor function recovery within patients receiving MP within the 8-hour window occurred in long spinal tracts as recorded below the level of the injury, although significant segmental recovery was also found at the level of the lesion (Bracken, 2001; Bracken and Holford, 1993). The criticism that the clinical signifi- cance of the functional improvement was not assessed by inclusion of functional or quality of life measures such as the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) in NASCIS II is valid. Recently, the NASCIS II principal investigator has published an estimate of functional recovery in NASCIS II from results modeled in the NASCIS III study that did include FIM assessments (Bracken and Holford, 2002). In that report, it is claimed: “The extent of MP ther- apy-related motor function recovery observed in NASCIS II predicted clinically important recovery in the FIM.” The final NASCIS II critique by Hurlbert (2000) con- cerning the questionable safety of high-dose MP therapy in SCI patients is difficult to reconcile with the NASCIS II data set, which found no significant differences in adverse reactions between placebo- and MP-treated patients (Bracken et al ., 1990, 1992). Since NASCIS II represents the only placebo-controlled trial of a 24-hour high-dose regimen in SCI patients, it is difficult to under- stand the claim that this particular regimen is unsafe. In contrast, the NASCIS III trial showed that extension of the duration of dosing from 24 to 48 hours resulted in an increased incidence of pneumonias and a nearly signifi- cant ( P < .07) increase in the occurrence of severe sepsis, both of which are undoubtedly manifestations of the immunosuppressive properties of intensive glucocorti- coid dosing (Bracken et al ., 1997). Therefore, the 48 Preserving Function in Acute Nervous System Injury Ch03.qxd 9/2/04 11:05 AM Page 48"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"available data that directly address the safety of high- dose MP in SCI patients in a controlled context shows that the 24-hour regimen is not associated with an incr ease in adverse reactions, whereas the 48-hour regimen does carry some risk of serious glucocorticoid-related prob- lems. This risk must be balanced against the results of NASCIS III showing that in patients not treated until after the first 3 post-SCI hours, the extension of dosing to 48 hours produces a significantly better neurological outcome compared to the 24-hour regimen. Considering the devastating nature of most SCIs, it would seem that the risk of MP treatment would be outweighed by the potential benefits to the patient’s neurological recovery. Hurlbert (2000) criticizes the NASCIS III trial on five counts: (1) lack of a placebo group, (2) the claim that the overall analysis was negative, (3) the stratification of patients treated within 3 hours vs between 3 and 8 hours was a post hoc analysis, (4) improvement in the FIM score in 48-hour MP-treated patients compared to the 24-hour MP cohort was modest, and (5) MP treatment is unsafe based on the increased incidence of sepsis and pneumo- nias. The first of these concerning the lack of a placebo group has already been addressed. The next two regarding the statistical analysis are identical to those leveled against NASCIS II. Here again, the NASCIS III investigators have gone on record as stating that the dichotomized analysis of the NASCIS III data on the basis of time to treatment (early vs late) was a preplanned and not a post hoc analysis (Bracken, 2001; Bracken et al ., 1997). The issue of the significance of the FIM score improvement shown in 48-hour MP patients in NASCIS III requires a careful viewing of the data. Hurlbert (2000) focuses on the fact that in the intent to treat analysis, the improvement in the total FIM score only reached a level of P < .08 (Bracken et al ., 1997). Looking at the subscores, however, reveals a significantly better self-care score in the 48-hour treated patients ( P < .03) and sphincter control score ( P < .01). If, however, the analysis is redone including only those patients in which the dosing protocols were com- pletely followed, even the total FIM score in the 48-hour treated patients reaches the .05 level vs the 24-hour MP cohort. In regard to the safety criticism, the 48-hour MP group displayed a significant increase in pneumonias and a nearly significant increase in severe sepsis compared to the 24-hour group. As noted previously, these are pre- dictable risks of high-dose glucocorticoid therapy in criti- cally ill patients. The risk/benefit ratio is a matter of personal opinion. The other two critiques (Coleman et al ., 2000; Short et al ., 2000) have multiple authors, and similar to Hurlbert (2000), intensely criticize not only the NASCIS trial design, analysis, and reporting, but also that of the pre- clinical studies that inspired the conduct of NASCIS II and III. As previously discussed, the principal investigator of the NASCIS trials has addressed the various criticisms and misunderstandings in the form of a recent meta- analysis of the NASCIS and non-NASCIS trials of MP in acute SCI, as well as their overall statistically significant support of the efficacy and safety of high-dose MP ther- apy for acute SCI (Bracken, 2001). He concludes from the meta-analysis that “high dose MP given within 8 hours of acute spinal cord injury is a safe and modestly effective therapy that may result in important clinical recovery for some patients. Further trials are needed to identify supe- rior pharmacological therapies and to test drugs that may sequentially influence the postinjury cascade.” This view is generally endorsed in a recent summary statement in the journal Spine from the Spine Focus Panel (Fehlings, 2001b) in which Dr. Michael Fehlings stated (Toronto, Ontario): Members of the Spine Focus Panel extensively discussed the role of methylprednisolone in acute spinal cord injury but could not reach agreement on key points. While it acknowl- edged that the NASCIS trials represent landmark clinical stud- ies, no clear consensus could be reached on the appropriate use of steroids in acute spinal cord injury. Many members of the Spine Focus Panel acknowledged that although methylpred- nisolone is only modestly neuroprotective, this drug is clearly indicated in acute spinal cord injury because of its favorable risk/benefit profile and the lack of alternative therapies. However, a significant minority was of the opinion that the evi- dence supporting the use of steroids in spinal cord injury was weak and did not justify the use of this medication. The Spine Focus Panel did agree that given the devastating impact of spinal cord injury and the modest efficacy of methylpred- nisolone, clinical trials of other therapeutic interventions are urgently needed. Many panel members also felt that a reanaly- sis of the NASCIS data might help to resolve the controversies surrounding the use of steroids in acute spinal cord injury. Of note, Dr. Bracken has agreed to release the data for “protocol- driven research by qualified investigators.” Following the Summary Statement, Dr. Fehlings pre- sented an editorial: Recommendations Regarding the Use of Methylprednisolone in Acute Spinal Cord Injury— Making Sense Out of the Controversy (Fehlings, 2001a) in which he first summarizes the criticisms of NASCIS II and III, and then presents the “Suggested Indications for the Use of Methylprednisolone in Acute SCI:” ● For acute nonpenetrating SCI (< 3 hours after injury), MP should be given as per NASCIS II protocol (i.e., 24 hours of treatment) ● For acute nonpenetrating SCI (> 8 hours after injury), MP should not be used ● For acute nonpenetrating SCI (after 3 hours, within 8 hours), MP should be given as per NASCIS III pro- tocol (i.e., 48 hours of treatment) ● For acute penetrating SCI, MP is not recommended Preserving Function in Acute Nervous System Injury 49 Ch03.qxd 9/2/04 11:05 AM Page 49"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"He closes the editorial by stating: Given the devastating impact of SCI and the evidence of a modest, beneficial effect of MP, clinicians should consciously consider using this drug despite the well-founded criticisms that have been directed against the NASCIS II and III trials. With great understanding of the biomolecular events contributing to the pathogenesis of SCI, it is hoped that other neuroprotective agents will enter into clinical practice in the next 5-10 years. Clinical Testing of Monosialoganglioside GM1 Besides MP and naloxone, the only other drug tested in Phase III trials in SCI patients is the monosialogan- glioside compound GM1. This compound was shown as far back as the 1970s to exert neuroprotective and neu- roregenerative effects in a variety of animal models of neural injury (Geisler et al ., 2001c; Gorio, 1986, 1988; Gorio and Vitadello, 1987), although it was never tested in an acute SCI model per se. Nevertheless, it captured the interest of non-NASCIS investigators to conduct clinical trials of its potential benefits in acute SCI. An ini- tial small single-center Phase II trial of 37 patients sug- gested that the administration of GM1 to SCI patients within 24 hours after injury might lead to an improve- ment in neurological recovery (Geisler et al ., 1990, 1991). Subsequently, the same investigator led a multicenter Phase III trial of GM1 in acute SCI patients. Since the organization of this trial occurred after the widespread acceptance of high-dose MP as the standard of care for acute SCI, the effects of GM1 were examined on top of the 24-hour NASCIS II high-dose MP protocol (Geisler et al ., 2001a, 2001b, 2001c). Administration of GM1 was begun after completion of the NASCIS II 24-hour MP dosing protocol (Geisler et al ., 2001a, 2001b, 2001c). The use of GM1 after MP therapy resulted in faster achieve- ment of peak neurological recovery, although the extent of functional improvement was not greater than that observed in patients who received only MP. This suggests that although GM1 may have some trophic effects that stimulate recovery, the compound is not neuroprotective in the context of acute SCI. DEVELOPMENT OF NEUROPROTECTIVE PHARMACOTHERAPY FOR BRAIN INJURY Drug Discovery and Development for Traumatic Brain Injury During the past 15 to 20 years, there has been intense activity in the pharmaceutical industry and academia to discover and develop pharmacological agents for acute treatment of TBI. Several glutamate receptor antagonists and release inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and free radical scavengers/antioxidants have been shown to be effective neuroprotectants in a variety of preclinical TBI models. As a result, at least five sepa- rate Phase II and III clinical development programs have been carried out over the last 15 years to evaluate the potential benefits of the calcium channel blocker nimodipine, the glutamate antagonists selfotel (CGS 19755) and aptiganel (CNS 1102), the free radical scav- enger polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismu- tase (PEG-SOD), and the LP inhibitor tirilazad (U-74006F) (Langham et al ., 2000; Marshall et al ., 1998; Narayan et al ., 2002). However, these trials, as a whole, have been therapeutic failures in that no overall benefit has been documented in moderate and severe TBI patient populations. These failures can be attributed to several factors. Perhaps most important, the preclinical assessment of compounds destined for acute TBI trials has been woefully inadequate in regard to the definition of neuroprotective dose-response relationships, pharma- cokinetic-pharmacodynamic correlations, therapeutic window, and optimum dosing regimen, and treatment duration (Narayan et al ., 2002). Effects of Tirilazad in TBI The protective efficacy of tirilazad has also been evalu- ated in multiple animal models of acute head injury. For instance, the compound significantly improves the early (1 to 4 hours) neurological recovery and survival of mice subjected to severe concussive head injury (Hall et al ., 1988). Tirilazad has similarly been shown to exert benefi- cial effects on motor recovery and survival in a rat model of moderately severe fluid percussion head injury (McIntosh et al ., 1992). In a cat model of severe concussive head injury, tirilazad significantly reduced posttraumatic lactic acid accumulation in both the cerebral cortex and subcortical white matter, indicative of a positive action on aerobic energy metabolism (Dimlich et al ., 1990). The locus of this particular effect is unclear. It most likely involves a protection of neuronal mitochondrial function. While the compound is largely localized in the microvascu- lar endothelium, the posttraumatic disruption of the BBB is known to allow the successful penetration of tirilazad into the brain parenchyma, as noted earlier (Hall et al ., 1992). Other mechanistic data derived from the rat- controlled cortical impact and the mouse concussive head injury models have definitively shown that a major effect of tirilazad is to lessen posttraumatic BBB opening (Hall et al ., 1992; Smith et al ., 1994). In the mouse model, the BBB protection occurred together with an attenuation of the early posttraumatic rise in brain hydroxyl radical levels measured via the salicylate trapping method (Hall et al ., 1992; Smith et al ., 1994). Thus the effect of tirilazad to 50 Preserving Function in Acute Nervous System Injury Ch03.qxd 9/2/04 11:05 AM Page 50"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"protect the BBB is paralleled by a reduced formation of hydroxyl radicals and/or a protection of the microvascular endothelium from hydroxyl radical-induced LP. Based on the strength of these data, tirilazad was eval- uated in two Phase III multicenter clinical trials for its ability to improve neurological recovery in moderate and closed head injury patients, one in North America and the other in Europe. In both trials, TBI patients were treated within 4 hours after injury with vehicle or tirilazad (2.5 mg/kg IV q6h for 5 days). The North American trial was never published because of a major confounding imbal- ance in the randomization of the patients to placebo or tirilazad in regard to injury severity and pretreatment neurological status. In contrast, the European trial had much better randomization balance and has been pub- lished (Marshall et al ., 1998). Results failed to show a sig- nificant beneficial effect of tirilazad in either moderate or severe patients. However, male TBI patients with trau- matic SAH showed significantly less mortality after treat- ment with tirilazad (34%) compared to placebo (43%, P < .026) (Lyons et al ., 1994; Marshall et al ., 1998). This result is consistent with the fact that this compound is highly effective in animal models of SAH (Hall et al ., 1994). Effects of High-Dose Methylprednisolone in TBI As discussed previously, MP has been shown to be neu- roprotective in large part via inhibition of posttraumatic LP in the injured cord. Despite a long and confused his- tory of steroid usage in acute TBI patients, success with high-dose MP in SCI has caused some to reconsider the possible application of identical treatment in human TBI. This view is supported by a recent meta-analysis of trials of steroids in TBI patients, which shows a small but statis- tically significant benefit (Alderson and Roberts, 1997). Although the extension of high-dose MP treatment from SCI to TBI has a strong rationale, the potential benefits vs detriments of MP have been inadequately studied in TBI models in terms of a careful mechanistically driven phar- macological approach. Thus, the efficacy vs safety of this treatment requires further study in animal models of dif- fuse and focal TBI. Nevertheless, as high-dose MP consti- tutes the only clinically demonstrated neuroprotective agent for acute CNS injury, full exploration of its neu- rotherapeutic potential, the validity of LP inhibition as a mechanistic hypothesis for its protective effects, and its potential glucocorticoid-related drawbacks is warranted. There is experimental evidence that the neuroprotec- tive properties of MP, extensively studied in SCI, may also be applicable to TBI. The steroid has been shown to enhance the early recovery of mice subjected to a moder- ately severe concussive head injury when administered at 5 minutes postinjury. The dose-response curve for this effect is remarkably similar to that discussed above for SCI (Hall, 1985). A 30-mg/kg IV dose was observed to be optimum, whereas lower (15-mg/kg) and higher (60- and 120 mg/kg) doses were ineffective. In the same study, two other glucocorticoids were compared with MP. Prednisolone, given in steroid-equivalent doses with MP, was equally efficacious but half as potent, in that a 60-mg/kg IV dose was optimal. Hydrocortisone was inef- fective in improving neurological recovery in injured mice at any dose up to 120 mg/kg. This structure activity rela- tionship parallels the relative abilities and potencies of these three steroids as inhibitors of lipid peroxidation (Braughler, 1985). Methylprednisolone and prednisolone are equally effi- cacious as lipid antioxidants in vitro , but the latter is half as potent. Hydrocortisone is ineffective as an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, even at exceedingly high concentra- tion. Dexamethasone, a steroid widely used in neuro- surgery, also possesses lipid antioxidant activity, but it is slightly less effective than MP or prednisolone. Consistent with the beneficial effect of high-dose MP in experimental head injury, one controlled clinical trial has shown that a high-dose regimen begun within 6 hours of severe injury (Glasgow Coma Scale scores 3 to 8) with a 30-mg/kg IV bolus can significantly increase survival and the recovery of speech (Giannotta et al ., 1984). However, while these data are suggestive, flaws in the study prevent it from being definitive. For instance, there were three groups of patients: a placebo group, a low-dose MP group (100-mg bolus plus 8 days of tapered maintenance dos- ing), and the high-dose group (30-mg/kg bolus plus tapered dosing). There was clearly no difference between the placebo and low-dose groups, but only when these two groups were combined after the study and statistically compared to the high-dose group could the significant effect on survival and speech recovery be demonstrated. Furthermore, the effect was only demonstrable if patients over 40 years old were excluded, also after data collection. Thus, an additional trial would be required to determine the efficacy of MP in brain injury. Nevertheless, prelimi- nary results with early administration of antioxidant doses of MP are more encouraging than various studies of treat- ment of head injury with conventional steroid dosing reg- imens, which show no apparent effect. CRASH Trial A few years ago, a group of investigators based in the United Kingdom, supported by the Medical Research Council, carried out a meta-analysis of all steroid TBI trials that had been carried out over the last 30 years. That analysis, which lumped together studies that used a variety of glucocorticoids, doses, and dosing regimens, showed that the risk of death was 2% less in patients treated with steroids than with placebo (Alderson and Preserving Function in Acute Nervous System Injury 51 Ch03.qxd 9/2/04 11:05 AM Page 51"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Roberts, 1997). The impression was that this small, but significant overall effect was due to those few studies that involved high doses of steroids. This, together with the benefits of high-dose MP in experimental and clinical SCI, inspired a 20,000 patient, multicenter, multinational clinical trial of the 48 hour NASCIS III MP dosing protocol within the first 8 hours after “TBI associated with impaired loss of consciousness” (i.e., moderate and severe TBI). This trial, the Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head Injury (CRASH) Trial has currently enrolled 9920 TBI patients (www.crash.lshtm.ac.uk). Although an extrapolation of the apparent efficacy of antioxidant dosing with MP to TBI is supported by its efficacy in acute SCI, the only studies that have examined the efficacy of high-dose TBI are those carried out by the lead author several years ago and discussed previously (Hall, 1985; Hall et al ., 1987). Although these studies demonstrated that high-dose MP could enhance neuro- logical recovery, the only time point examined was 1 hour postinjury. An investigation of its ability to reduce posttraumatic oxidative damage or neurodegeneration or to improve chronic neurological recovery has not been carried out. Moreover, the possible detrimental effects of high-dose MP have not been evaluated in TBI models. Consequently, the ongoing CRASH Trial lacks any mechanism-based preclinical experimentation with which to interpret whatever efficacy, or lack thereof, may be observed. Furthermore, even if 48-hour high-dose MP treatment is shown to be significantly beneficial, there is presently no preclinical analysis of the pharmacology of MP in TBI models with which to optimize steroid treat- ment in regard to mechanism of action, dose-response, pharmacodynamic-pharmacokinetic correlation, thera- peutic window (i.e., 8-hour window seen in SCI may not be the same in TBI), and optimal treatment duration (48 hours may not be ideal). Effects of Cyclosporin A in TBI Mitochondrial dysfunction has been documented to occur in several experimental models of TBI, including controlled cortical impact (Sullivan et al ., 1998, 1999a, 1999b; Xiong et al ., 1997), fluid percussion (Lifshitz et al ., 2003; Sullivan et al ., 2000b), and human head injury patients (Verweij et al ., 2000). Increased mito- chondrial ROS production (Sullivan et al ., 1998, 1999b), reduced mitochondrial respiration (Xiong et al ., 1997), disruption of Ca ++ buffering, and reduced thresholds for mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) (Sullivan et al ., 1999b, 2000a; Xiong et al ., 1997) have all been docu- mented both at acute (15 to 30 minutes) and chronic time (7 to 14 days postinjury) points postinjury. The promi- nent role that mitochondria and possibly the mPT play in neuronal cell survival and death after TBI have recently come to light as a result of several studies that have tar- geted mitochondrial dysfunction after TBI. The inner mitochondrial membrane is normally imper- meable to solutes that are not specifically transported. The mPT is defined as the sudden increase of inner mem- brane permeability to solutes of molecular mass less than 1500 daltons (Bernardi, 1996; Bernardi et al ., 1994; Nicolli et al ., 1996). This loss of impermeability is due to the opening of a proteinaceous pore and is a catastrophic event that results in swelling of the mitochondrial matrix, rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane, and a complete uncoupling of the electron transport system from ATP production. The first definitive reports of mod- ulation of the mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore (mPTP) came in the late 1980s and demonstrated that even sub- μ M concentrations of cyclosporin A (CsA) transiently blocked calcium-induced mitochondrial sur- veilling. CsA is an undecapeptide of fungal origin that is used clinically as an immunosuppressive agent. CsA inhibits the activation of T cells by inhibiting the protein phosphatase 2B, also know as calcineurin, and the subse- quent transcription of the interleukin (IL)-2 gene. CsA inhibits the opening of the mPTP by inhibiting the inter- action of matrix cyclophilin with the adenine nucleotide translocator, thus preventing mPT-induced loss of mito- chondrial homeostasis (Broekemeier et al ., 1989; Broeke- meier and Pfeiffer, 1995; Szabo and Zoratti, 1991). Okonkwo and colleagues (1999) showed that an intrathecal bolus of CsA (20 mg/kg), preinjury, reduced dif- fuse axonal injury and Ca ++ -induced cytoskeletal damage following TBI in rats. The clinically relevant question of CsA efficacy postinjury was then tested in two different strains of mice and in rats by Scheff and Sullivan (1999). CsA significantly reduced cortical damage (50%) after TBI when administered intraperitoneally 15 minutes and 24 hours after injury. There appeared to be a biphasic dose response for the neuroprotective benefits of CsA, with the greatest protection afforded by the lowest dose (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally) (Scheff and Sullivan, 1999). This study also showed that the immunosuppressive properties of CsA were most likely not responsible for the neuroprotection, as the more potent immunosuppressor FK506 afforded no neuroprotection in this paradigm. In a follow-up study, mitochondrial function was directly assessed after TBI (Sullivan et al ., 1999b). These results suggested that the neuroprotective properties of CsA were mediated through modulation of the mPTP and maintenance of mitochon- drial homeostasis after TBI because it was demonstrated that administration of CsA (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally) 15 minutes after injury significantly attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction measured using several biochemical assays of mitochondria integrity and bioenergetics. Although CsA is FDA-approved and routinely used in the clinic as an immunosuppressor, it has been shown to 52 Preserving Function in Acute Nervous System Injury Ch03.qxd 9/2/04 11:05 AM Page 52"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"have significant dose-dependent neurological effects, including seizures and cell death (Berden et al ., 1985; de Groen et al ., 1987; Famiglio et al ., 1989; Kahan, 1989; Walker and Brochstein, 1988). Therefore it was critical to determine the complete dose curve for CsA neuroprotec- tion after TBI. To address this question, injured animals were administered various dosages (40 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg) of CsA or vehicle 15 min- utes after injury with a subsequent injection 24 hours later. The most advantageous CsA therapy was a 20 mg/kg bolus intraperitoneal injection initiated 15 min- utes after injury. Although other doses of CsA ranging from 40 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg significantly reduced cortical damage compared to vehicle-treated animals, subjects treated with 20 mg/kg were afforded the greatest neuro- protection (Scheff and Sullivan, 1999; Sulhran et al. , 2000b). The extent of the postinjury therapeutic window was also shown in this study by administering the opti- mal dose of CsA (20 mg/kg) at various times after injury. Results demonstrate that CsA therapy was effective when initiated at 15 minutes, 1 hour, or 24 hours after injury. Paradoxically, the efficacy was lost if therapy with CsA was initiated at 6 hours after injury. That onset of treat- ment 24 hours after injury was as effective as initiation at 1 hour illustrating that the mechanisms responsible for the tissue destruction were active and amenable to phar- macological manipulation for at least 24 hours after injury. Lack of neuroprotection by CsA if administration is delayed for 6 hours after injury may highlight the role of the BBB in designing TBI therapeutics. CsA does not freely cross the intact BBB (Shiga et al. , 1992; Uchino et al. , 1995, 1998) so after TBI, this allows targeting of CsA to the injured tissue, however dynamic fluctuations in the permeability of the BBB post-injury would also block CsA uptake. Since the time frame of secondary injury resulting from TBI ranges from minutes to days, continuous dos- ing of CsA could be advantageous. To address this ques- tion, animals were administered a 20 mg/kg intraperi toneal bolus of CsA or vehicle 15 minutes postinjury followed by continuous delivery of CsA (4.5 or 10 mg/kg per day) for 7 days postinjury. All animals receiving CsA showed a significant reduction in lesion volume, with the highest dose offering the most neuroprotection (74% reduction in lesion volume) (Sullivan et al. , 2000c). These data highlight the possible need for multiple dosing regimens after TBI. While all animals receiving CsA were signifi- cantly better than vehicle-treated controls, injured ani- mals receiving only a single bolus injection were afforded the least protection and administering a second bolus injection 24 hours after injury afforded greater neuropro- tection. Continuous infusion of CsA for 7 days resulted in the greatest sparing of tissue. The therapeutic window appeared to be within the first 7 days, as continuous infu- sion at 10mg/kg per day almost completely eliminated tissue loss in some animals. That animals administered a second bolus after 24 hours were noticeably better than the single injection group suggests that the first 24 hours is perhaps a critical window for CsA administration. These studies show that CsA has emerged as a prom- ising therapeutic agent for TBI, although the drug dis- plays complex pharmacokinetics, even in the tightly controlled laboratory setting. Currently, two Phase IIa single center clinical trials are being conducted at the University of Kentucky (B. Young, P.I.) and the Medical College of Virginia (R. Bullock, P.I.) to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of CsA, including CSF penetration of CsA, as a prelude to an evaluation of its neuroprotective efficacy. HOW DO WE BUILD ON PAST SUCCESS? This chapter has reviewed the ability to translate neu- roprotective effects of pharmacological agents in TBI and SCI models into successful clinical trials. Thus far, the discovery and development of high dose MP therapy in acute SCI are arguably the most successful demon- stration of clinical neuroprotection to date (NASCIS II and III), although its use is not without controversy. Also, there are perhaps enough data in SCI trials (NASCIS III) to show that the neuroprotective effects of the glucocorticoid steroid MP, which are believed to be largely due to antioxidant actions, can be duplicated by the nonglucocorticoid steroid tirilazad. Additional trials with tirilazad would seem warranted, as this steroid is devoid of steroid side effect potential and is therefore safe for more prolonged administration compared to MP. It would seem that naloxone dosing in NASCIS II may have produced enough of an effect to validate its neuroprotective efficacy shown in experimental SCI models. Although the effects of GM-1 are similarly modest, this compound does seem to improve the rate, although not the extent, of post-SCI neurological recov- ery in SCI patients. Clinical trials are in progress to evaluate whether the neuroprotective effects of high-dose MP shown in SCI can be extrapolated to TBI (CRASH Trial) and whether the immunosuppressive agent CsA, which is neuropro- tective via its ability to block mitochondrial damage, can improve neurological recovery in TBI patients. Not discussed in this chapter are the many promising pharmacotherapies and mechanisms that are being eval- uated at the preclinical level. Based on past experience with neuroprotective drug discovery and development, however, several considerations are apparent in regard to how best to evaluate neuroprotective agents before attempting translation into clinical trials: Preserving Function in Acute Nervous System Injury 53 Ch03.qxd 9/2/04 11:05 AM Page 53"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"● Demonstration of the time course of the target patho- physiological mechanism in relevant animal models. This is needed to determine when treatment needs to begin and how long it must be maintained. ● Rigorous dose-response analysis in regard to effects on the target mechanism, ability to reduce posttraumatic neurodegeneration and improve behavioral recovery. ● Correlation of neuroprotective action with plasma and CNS tissue pharmacokinetics. ● Correlation of plasma and CNS pharmacokinetics with plasma or CNS biomarker (e.g., lipid peroxidation products). ● Comparison of single vs multiple-dose regimens to estab- lish optimum treatment regimen (NASCIS experience suggests IV bolus plus infusion makes the most sense). ● Determination of therapeutic window in order to know how early treatment must begin. ● Comparison of neuroprotective pharmacology in mul- tiple injury models to determine whether the agent in question works only in certain types of injuries. ● Determination of pharmacodynamic and pharmacoki- netic interactions with other commonly used ancillary treatments (e.g., anticonvulsants). The detailed preclinical evaluation of neuroprotective agents in TBI or SCI models should then be followed by a clinical trial design that is consistent with the results of pre- clinical trials. One of the most glaring examples of how this has not been done concerns the issue of therapeutic win- dow. Even with agents for which the therapeutic efficacy window had been determined, the subsequent clinical trials typically involved an enrollment window that far exceeded the time at which a particular agent could have been expected to retain neuroprotective potential. It has been argued, in these instances, that if a particular agent only has a 1-hour window in a rat TBI or SCI model, the window in humans with the corresponding condition is likely to be much longer; however, there is absolutely no evidence to support this assumption. On the contrary, the therapeutic window shown for high-dose (antioxidant) MP therapy in humans (8 hours) (Bracken et al. , 1990) is reminiscent of the 8-hour window shown for the antioxidant tirilazad in a cat SCI model (Anderson et al. , 1991). Thus, the time course of posttraumatic LP may not be all that different between cats and humans. Whether this is consistently the case across pathophysiological mechanisms requires further study. At this point, it would be prudent to take the magnitude of the therapeutic window determined in animal CNS injury models literally when planning clinical trials. Consequently, from a practical standpoint, it is no longer appropriate to advance compounds into clinical trials in SCI or TBI that have not been demonstrated to have a therapeutic window of at least 2 or more hours. Ideally agents with at least an 8 hour window would carry the greatest clinical practicality. Key to improving the successful translation of preclini- cal neuroprotective effects into successful mechanism-based clinical trials is the identification of measurable biomarkers that allow the pathophysiology and drug effects thereon to be determined. Three examples of promising CNS injury biomarkers are the LP-related isoprostanes (Pratico et al. , 2002) and neuroprostanes (Morrow and Roberts, 2002), degradation products of the cytoskeletal protein α -spectrin (Pike et al. , 2001), and the astrocytic injury marker S100 β (Pelinka et al. , 2003; Wunderlich, 2003). The validation of these for monitoring of posttraumatic injury to the spinal cord or brain will lead to a quantifiable means for the more efficient clinical evaluation of neuroprotective pharma- cotherapies in regard to dose-response, therapeutic window, and optimal dosing regimen.

Rudick, MD CHAPTER 4 This book tracks the therapeutic transformation of neurology and the rapidly evolving understanding of dis- ease mechanisms on which progress is based. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation, myelin and axonal destruction, intermittent disability, and even- tual chronic progressive neurological deterioration. The rapid transformation of MS from untreatable to partially controllable and concurrent advances in understanding its underlying mechanisms over a 20-year period have been remarkable. Events over 20 years also exemplify the interdependence between therapeutic advances and basic neurobiological research. These two seemingly indepen- dent approaches to the study of human disease have become intertwined in the MS field. Clinical trials are indispensable for confirming mechanistic hypotheses, and mechanistic research has become indispensable for designing and testing clinical hypotheses. In this chapter, I review major historical developments in MS therapeu- tics and changing concepts of MS, and will emphasize the interdependence between these two lines of work. During the past 20 years, a short interval relative to the history of MS knowledge, we have developed extraordi- nary new insights into MS pathogenesis, as well as thera- pies that meaningfully ameliorate the disease. While current therapies are measurably effective, they are by no means adequate. It is hoped that advances in under- standing pathology and pathogenesis will lead to even more rapid progress over the next 20 years. BRIEF HISTORY OF MS EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS Before the 1980s, MS therapeutics was relatively unde- veloped as a discipline. There were no accepted methods for testing putative therapies empirically, and therapeutic claims without scientific evidence dominated (van den Noort, 1983). A notable exception was the study by Rose and colleagues (1968, 1970). That study set a standard for testing therapeutic interventions in MS and for doing out- comes research in MS generally. During the clinical trial, the Standard Neurologic Examination, the Kurtzke Disability Status Scale, and a 7-day symptom score were evaluated and each was found to be a reliable indicator of neurological status (Kuzma et al ., 1969). Rose and colleagues documented short-term benefits of ACTH in resolving disability related to relapse. It also docu- mented the feasibility of multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trials, and foreshadowed an era of much more scientific approaches to MS therapeutics. In April 1982, the MS Societies of the United States and Canada convened the first international conference on therapeutic trials in MS on Grand Isle, NY (Herndon and Murray, 1983). Conference participants were skepti- cal about the feasibility of MS clinical trials, voicing con- cerns that MS was too variable and too unpredictable, that there were no reliable outcome measures, and little understanding of the disease mechanisms. The partici- pants advocated basic research in preference to clinical trials. The important topics discussed at the conference included the rationale for therapeutic approaches, scor- ing techniques and problems in evaluating patients, design problems, interpretation of contemporary trial results, financing for clinical trials, patient selection, sim- ple protocol development, and ethical or legal aspects of clinical trials. The Grand Isle conference was a watershed event that ended an inactive, nihilistic period, and ush- ered in a 20-year period of unprecedented advances in MS therapeutics. The most significant development in the 1980s in MS experimental therapeutics was not a clinical trial; it was the application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to MS patients. Initially a diagnostic tool (Johnson et al ., 1984), 61 Ch04.qxd 9/1/04 6:31 AM Page 61"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"MRI quickly became entrenched as a tool to understand evolution and pathogenesis of MS and to monitor therapy. Also in the 1980s, a large multicenter trial of cyclosporine was conducted for progressive MS (The Multiple Sclerosis Study Group, 1990). The study found an unfavorable ratio of efficacy to toxicity, so cyclosporine did not achieve wide- spread use. Analogous to the ACTH trial, pivotal out- comes research was done as part of the cyclosporine trial. Syndulko and Tourtellotte applied quantitative evaluation of neurological function to a subset in the cyclosporine study. This approach provided sensitive and reliable mark- ers of disease progression and foreshadowed development of the multiple sclerosis functional composite (MSFC), which was recommended as a clinical trial outcome mea- sure 10 years later (Rudick et al ., 1996, 1997). In the 1990s, pivotal trials of disease-modifying drugs were conducted, described later, leading to approval and marketing of partially effective therapies for relapsing remitting MS (RRMS). This formally ended the era of MS as an untreatable disease, and stimulated intense interest in MS by the pharmaceutical industry. Also, in the mid-1990s, the underlying basis for MS clinical trials was advanced by another pivotal workshop, this one on outcome measures (Whitaker et al ., 1995). The scientific methods for testing experimental therapies were exam- ined and critiqued, and recommendations were provided for future progress. As a direct outgrowth of this work- shop, task forces were organized to develop recommen- dations on the use of MRI as a clinical trial outcome measure (Miller et al ., 1996) and to recommend optimal strategies for clinical outcome assessment in future trials (Rudick et al ., 1997). Into the late twentieth century, MS was viewed as a disease characterized by episodic relapses, occurring about once per year, interspersed with disease remission. Relapses were assumed to be caused by immune attack on CNS tissue, and MS became the prototypic organ- specific autoimmune disease, a distinction that remains. As implied by the name relapsing remitting MS , the dis- ease was assumed to be quiescent between relapses. This explains the near-exclusive focus on relapses (also known as exacerbations) through the 1980s. Relapse count or rate was considered a direct and straightforward disease measure and was the most common outcome measure for clinical trials in RRMS. To some degree, this view still holds. It was recognized that many patients eventually developed gradually progressive neurological disability, a disease stage termed secondary progressive MS (SPMS). This occurred most commonly 15 to 20 years after symp- tom onset. This phase of the disease was considered to be different from RRMS , but the mechanisms leading to transition from RRMS to SPMS were not known. During the progressive stage of MS, neurological disability was viewed as a more appropriate measure of the disease process, and the Kurtzke Disability Status Scale (Kurtzke, 1955) and subsequently the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (Kurtzke, 1983) were accepted as direct measures of the underlying disease. This describes the prevailing view of MS and its measurement at the time of the Grand Isle international conference on MS Clinical Trials. MRI studies in the 1980s were changing the tradi- tional view of MS, however. New brain lesions were observed in clinically stable patients, dispelling the myth of remission between relapses. The ratio of new MRI lesions to clinical relapses was reported as 4:1 (Paty, 1993) and later increased to 10:1 (McFarland et al ., 1996). An early pioneer in the application of MRI to MS, Don Paty, commonly stated that MRI visualized the pathology and was a much more direct disease measure than clinical outcomes. As a result of the MRI studies, MS was more accurately perceived as active during the early stages, and relapses were increasingly seen as only a loose reflection of underlying pathology. Disease activity and progression during the relapsing stage of MS were viewed increasingly as subclinical, and MRI was incor- porated into MS clinical trials. At the present time, MS is viewed as a largely subclin- ical inflammatory disease in its early stage. Periodic relapses punctuate the early course in most cases, but do not accurately reflect the severity of the underlying pathology. As viewed by imaging studies, MS is a contin- uously active, albeit fluctuating disease process, which results in irreversible brain tissue injury and brain atro- phy alarmingly early in the disease course. After years of fluctuating inflammation with related tissue injury, pro- gressive neurological disability ensues relatively late in the disease. The pathological targets in MS are now known to include neurons and axons in addition to myelin, and progressive axonal loss is thought responsi- ble for progressive neurological disability commonly observed in later stages. In the tradition of Rose and col- leagues in the 1970s, and Syndulko, Tourtellotte, and col- leagues in the 1980s, attention has turned toward outcomes assessment, both through rapidly evolving imaging techniques and improved clinical assessement methodology, and to therapeutic targets. INTERFERON THERAPY FOR MS Interferon therapy is the most widely used disease ther- apy for MS. The history of its development is described elsewhere (Jacobs and Johnson, 1994). The reader may wish to consult various detailed reviews of interferon clini- cal trials (Calabresi, 2002; Grigoriadis, 2002; Horowski, 2002; Hughes, 2003; Noseworthy, 2003; Noseworthy et al ., 2000; Rolak, 2001; Rudick, 2001; Vartanian, 2003; Wiendl 62 Slowing the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Ch04.qxd 9/1/04 6:31 AM Page 62"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"and Kieseier, 2003). In this section, key trials will be high- lighted to point out results of historical significance and to relate interferon therapy to disease pathogenesis. Rationale and Early Trials The rationale for testing interferon was the view that MS might be caused by a viral infection and the obser- vation that lymphocytes from MS patients produced sub- normal amounts of interferon in response to viral or mitogen challenge (Neighbour et al ., 1981). Early studies used natural interferon preparations produced by fibro- blast cultures. Natural interferon- β was administered by intrathecal injection (Jacobs et al ., 1981), and natural interferon- α by subcutaneous injection (Knobler et al ., 1984) in independent studies that were started around the same time. Results suggested that interferon α or β (both type I interferons) reduced the frequency of clinical relapses. Definitive interpretation was difficult because the studies were small (10 patients in the Jacobs study and 24 in the Knobler study) and because of method- ological limitations. Recombinant DNA technology developed during the 1980s eventuated in recombinant interferon preparations (rIFN) in sufficient purity and quantity to allow large scale testing. A pilot study of intravenous rIFN γ (type II interferon) was initiated because IFN γ shared antiviral, antiproliferative, and certain immunomodulatory activi- ties with type I interferons. Unexpectedly, patients treated with rIFN γ exhibited an alarmingly high relapse rate dur- ing the initial month of treatment, leading to early termi- nation of the study (Panitch et al ., 1987). The explanation for worsening disease with IFN- γ but amelioration with IFN- β or IFN- α has never been fully clarified, but all sub- sequent interferon studies have used type I interferon. Some investigators suggested that differential immune effects of type I and type II interferon might underlie dif- ferent clinical effects, but this remains conjectural. Efficacy with IFN- α was confirmed in a larger trial (Durelli et al ., 1994), but significant toxicity discouraged further development. Definitive trials of interferon for MS have therefore used recombinant preparations of IFN- β . Definitive Trials In the most remarkable 10-year period in the history of MS therapeutics, pivotal trials with three preparations of IFN- β were planned, conducted, and successfully com- pleted between 1987 and 1997. The studies led to approval for RRMS by regulatory agencies for IFN- β 1b (Betaseron) (The IFN- β Multiple Sclerosis Study Group, 1993), IFN- β 1a (Avonex) (Jacobs et al ., 1996), and IFN- β 1a (Rebif) (PRISMS Study Group, 1998). The IFN- β 1b (Betaseron) study was historical for two main reasons. First, Betaseron was the initial drug approved to modify the natural history of MS. Its approval officially ended the era of MS as an untreatable disease. Second, approval was dependent on the observation that Betaseron reduced new MRI lesions. Betaseron was the first drug that achieved U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval based on expedited review authority allowing use of a nonclinical surrogate marker. Since there were no statistically significant benefits of Betaseron on the disability endpoints, the drug may not have been approved were it not for prominent reduction in new T 2 lesions. After the FDA approved Betaseron in spring 1993, all MS clinical trials incorporated cranial MRI scans. Interestingly, the pivotal study of glatiramer acetate (GA, Copaxone), designed before the end of the Betaseron study, did not include MRI scans. Glatiramer acetate was approved for use on the basis of a beneficial relapse effect. A study was conducted subsequently to eval- uate the effects of GA on MRI lesions (Comi et al ., 2001b). The second pivotal interferon trial tested IFN- β 1a (Avonex) (Jacobs et al ., 1996). This trial was of historical significance for several reasons. It was the first major RRMS trial targeting disability progression as the primary endpoint. Relapses were demoted to a secondary outcome status. This resulted from the NIH peer review. In the con- text of new MRI studies showing subclinical disease activ- ity, the study section viewed relapses as a suboptimal outcome measure. Although disability progression had not been a focus of prior trials in RRMS, members of the study section recommended that the investigation focus on disability progression. Disability progression was defined as ≥ 1.0 point worsening from baseline EDSS, persisting for at least 6 months. The Avonex trial also incorporated a time-to-failure (survival curve) analysis for the primary outcome, a method not commonly used in MS trials. The study demonstrated a 37% reduction in the probability of sustained disability progression with IFN- β 1a, which sat- isfied the prospectively selected primary outcome measure. While the drug was approved by regulatory agencies, the study results were controversial, as there was no consensus in the MS field on the proper definition of disability pro- gression in RRMS. The Avonex study stimulated much lively debate about the significance of the endpoint used in the trial and about optimal clinical outcome measures for RRMS trials generally. The PRISMS trial of IFN- β 1a (Rebif) (PRISMS Study Group, 1998) compared placebo with two doses of IFN- β 1a—22 μ g and 44 μ g—administered by subcuta- neous injection three times per week. Relapse count per patient was the primary outcome in this trial, but disabil- ity progression, defined as a 1-point worsening from base- line EDSS lasting at least 3 months, was included as a secondary outcome measure. As with the Avonex trial, Slowing the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis 63 Ch04.qxd 9/1/04 6:31 AM Page 63"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"the PRISMS study used time-to-failure analysis for the disability outcome. Results on this outcome were similar to the Avonex trial. At the end of the originally planned 2-year PRISMS study, patients on IFN- β 1a were contin- ued on drug, and placebo patients were randomized to either of the two doses. Patients were then monitored an additional 2 years, and about 80% of the original study population was available for analysis at 4 years. This inter- esting design permitted evaluation delayed compared with early treatment. This study has provided some of the best evidence suggesting that early therapy is beneficial. The three pivotal RRMS interferon studies recruited patients with similar characteristics: disease duration between 4 and 8 years, relatively high prestudy relapse rates, and mild-moderate disability at study entry (Table 4.1). Disease duration was similar but by no means the same in the different trials. For example, disease duration was about 50% longer in the Avonex compared with the Betaseron study. Since disease duration may be an impor- tant determinant of therapeutic outcome (see SPMS dis- cussion later), this difference in the study populations may be important. Second, there is variation in prestudy relapse rate between the trials. Patients in the Betaseron study had higher relapse rates than Avonex patients. While this may relate to methodological differences in defining and recording relapses, it highlights a major problem in MS clinical trials: lack of standard definitions or standard pro- cedures for defining or measuring relapses. Consequently, comparing trial results from the separate studies is haz- ardous and probably not meaningful. Table 4.2 lists the effects of IFN- β on relapses or new MRI activity. There is a dose effect for the Betaseron study—the rate ratio for relapses was 0.87 with the lower dose and 0.69 with the higher dose. However, there was no dose effect in the Rebif study—the rate ratio was 0.71 for the lower dose and 0.68 for the higher dose. This sug- gests that increasing the dose beyond a ceiling does not translate into additional therapeutic benefits. The rate ratio in the Avonex trial was 0.70 for patients studied for 2 years, but 0.82 when all patients were included. The dif- ference has not been fully explained. One possibility is that patients monitored for short intervals may artifi- cially impact relapse rate calculations. Another possibil- ity is that patients monitored for less than 2 years (who were entered toward the end of the Avonex trial) had less disease activity than patients entered earlier in the study, thereby reducing the relapse rate in the placebo patients. Irrespective of the correct explanation, the relapse rate reduction in the whole Avonex trial population raised the possibility that a suboptimal dose of IFN- β 1a was used. Because of this concern, a study was conducted to deter- mine if 60 μ g IFN- β 1a (Avonex) intramuscularly weekly was more effective than 30 μ g as used in the original trial. That study enrolled over 800 patients, so it was ade- quately powered to determine differences. There was no benefit of the higher dose, however (Clanet et al ., 2002). Second, Table 4.2 shows that rate ratios were lower for MRI activity measures compared with clinical relapses, indicating a higher therapeutic effect size for MRI activ- ity compared with relapses. This interesting finding has stimulated debate about the significance of new MRI lesions compared with relapses in RRMS studies. Which parameter is more meaningful? To date, there are no data regarding how these two outcomes compare as predictors for clinically meaningful disability in future years. Direct comparison across studies is also difficult for disability measures. The designs of the studies, duration of follow-up period, and application of the EDSS scale differed in each study. Also, the distribution of patients at each EDSS level differed. This alone would result in different progression rates from study to study, as the amount of time patients remain at each EDSS step differs (Weinshenker et al ., 1991). Despite these caveats, EDSS was applied in all three pivotal trials. For all patients and all time on study in the Betaseron trial, there was no reduction in 3- month sustained EDSS worsening for the lower dose group, 64 Slowing the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis TABLE 4.1 Characteristics of Patients in Pivotal Trials Leading to Approval of IFN for Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Disease Duration (Yrs) RR* in Prior 2 Years EDSS † at Study Entry EDSS Range IFN- β 1b (Betaseron) Placebo 3.9 1.8 2.8 0-5.5 8 MIU SC QOD 4.7 1.7 3.0 IFN- β 1a (Avonex) Placebo 6.4 1.2 2.3 1-3.5 30 μ g IM QWk 6.6 1.2 2.4 IFN- β 1a (Rebif) Placebo 6.1 1.5 2.4 22 μ g SC 3 times per wk 7.7 1.5 2.5 0-5.5 44 μ g SC 3 times per wk 7.8 1.5 2.5 * RR=relapse rate † EDSS=Expanded Disability Status Score Ch04.qxd 9/1/04 6:32 AM Page 64"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"and a 29% statisti cally nonsignificant reduction in the higher dose group. For the Avonex study there was a 37%, statistically significant, reduction in 6-month sus- tained EDSS worsening in the active arm. For the Rebif study, there was a 23% statistically significant reduction in 3-month sustained EDSS worsening with the lower dose, and a 31% statistically significant reduction with the higher dose. EDSS change from baseline was not published for the Betaseron study. For the 2-year cohort in the Avonex study, mean EDSS worsening was 0.74 in placebo patients, and 0.25 in IFN- β 1a patients. In the Rebif study, mean EDSS worsening was 0.48 in placebo patients, reduced to 0.23 in the lower dose patients and 0.24 in the higher dose patients. The explanation for beneficial effects on EDSS in the IFN- β 1a studies, but not in the IFN- β 1b study is not clear. This may relate to methodological differences related to EDSS or may reflect lower efficacy with the IFN- β 1b drug. Subsequent Studies in Other MS Disease Categories The pivotal RRMS interferon trials changed the per- ception of MS from an untreatable to a treatable condi- tion, which has had profound scientific, psychological, and practical implications. The “market” for MS disease therapy quickly d eveloped, with worldwide sales of inter- feron products now exceeding $2.5 billion. This has driven pharmaceutical industry investment in MS research. Studies were initiated to evaluate the effects of interferon in SPMS, and at the time of a clinically isolated syndrome, as well as numerous head-to-head comparison studies, most designed to show that one product was “superior” to another, as reviewed by Kappos (2003). Two studies addressed the effects of IFN- β 1a at the time of a clinically isolated syndrome. In the CHAMPS study (Jacobs et al ., 2000), 383 patients with an acute demyelinating event, together with brain MRI lesions, were randomized to receive weekly IFN- β 1a (Avonex) or placebo, after initial treatment with high-dose corti- costeroids. During a follow-up period of up to 2 years, the cumulative probability of developing clinically defi- nite MS was lower in the IFN- β 1a than the placebo group (rate ratio, 0.56). The IFN- β 1a group also had significantly reduced volumes of T 2 -weighted MRI brain lesions, fewer new or enlarging T 2 lesions, and fewer gadolinium-enhancing lesions at 18 months. Comi and colleagues (2001a) reported results from the ETOMS study, in which patients with clinically isolated syndromes were randomized to IFN- β 1a (Rebif) 22 μ g once weekly, or placebo. Fewer patients on Rebif devel- oped clinically definite MS (34% vs 45%; P < .05). Both the CHAMPS and ETOMS studies demonstrated that IFN- β 1a treatment at the first MS clinical symptom had significant positive effects on clinical and MRI out- comes. These studies were important for the following reasons: 1. Both studies demonstrated that patients with clini- cally isolated syndromes and ≥ 2 cranial MRI lesions had a high risk of developing relapses or new MRI lesions within 2 years. 2. The studies provide large cohorts in which to deter- mine the relationship between baseline characteristics and future disability. Such studies will be useful in identifying patients at first presentation who are at high risk for disability progression who can be selected for more aggressive medical management.

They provide a potential opportu- nity to determine long-term benefits of treatment started at first presentation, and may be useful in deter- mining individual therapeutic response predictors. The second major initiative following the RRMS tri- als was application of IFN- β to SPMS. Four major trials were conducted, as listed in Tables 4.3 and 4.4. In the first study, The European SP MS Study (European Study Group on interferon be ta-1b in secondary progressive MS, 1998; Miller et al., 1999), IFN- β 1b (Betaferon) 8 MIU (Million International Units) SC QOD (every other day) was compared with placebo in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial. There was a significant benefit of treatment on time to EDSS progression ( ≥ 1.0 worsening from base- line EDSS, confirmed after 3 months). The benefit was apparent across EDSS levels, and in patients with or with- out superimposed relapses. As in the RRMS trials, the modest clinical benefits were accompanied by more pro- nounced MRI benefits. A subset of 95 patients was studied over 36 months to determine the effect of IFN- β 1b on MRI markers of tissue destruction (Molyneux et al ., 2000). Cerebral volumes declined by 3.9% in the placebo group and 2.9% in the treated group by month 36. The differences were not statistically significant. There was, however, a therapeutic effect of IFN- β 1b on T 1 black holes (Barkhof et al ., 2001) in the same patients. Baseline T 1 black hole lesion load was matched at baseline in the two groups; it increased by a median of 14% per year in the placebo group and 7.7% per year in IFN- β 1b group ( P < 0.01). Because of the beneficial effects of IFN- β 1b on EDSS progression and T 1 black hole progression, these encour- aging results suggested that IFN- β 1b may have reduced axonal injury in SPMS. This was a very hopeful, but transient, moment in the history of IFN- β therapy for MS; unfortunately, it was not replicated in other interferon SPMS studies. A second trial of the same drug, IFN- β 1b (Betaseron) (Goodkin & The North American Study Group on Interferon beta-1b in Secondary Progressive MS, 2000) in SPMS used a sim- ilar study design. Disappointingly, the North American Study found positive results only on measures of disease activity—relapses and MRI lesions—and failed to repli- cate the disability results from the European Study. This perplexing result underscored the importance of replicat- ing research findings generally, but also led to discussions about differences between the European and North American patient populations, discussed later. A third study in SPMS, the SPECTRIMS Study, tested IFN- β 1a (Rebif), 22 μ gm and 44 μ g SC three times per week compared with placebo (Li et al ., 2001; Secondary Progressive Efficacy Clinical Trial of Recombinant Interferon-beta-1a in MS (SPECTRIMS) Study Group, 2001). In a fourth study, the IMPACT Study, IFN- β 1a (Avonex) 60 μ g IM QW was tested against placebo (Cohen et al ., 2002). Both the SPECTRIMS Study and the IMPACT study failed to demonstrate therapeutic benefits 66 Slowing the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis TABLE 4.3 Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials of Interferon- β in Secondary Progressive MS (Modified from Marrie and Cohen, 2003) Eu IFN- b 1b NA IFN- b 1b SPECTRIMS IMPACT Centers 32 35 22 42 Subjects 718 939 618 436 Entry criteria Age 18-55 Age 18-65 Age 18-55 Age 18-60 EDSS 3.0-6.5 EDSS 3.0-6.5 EDSS 3.0-6.5 with EDSS 3.5-6.5 Pyramidal Functional System Score ≥ 2 Treatment IFN- β 1b (Betaferon) IFN- β 1b (Betaferon) IFN- β 1a (Rebif) IFN- β 1a (Avonex) 8MIU 8 MIU 44 μ g 60 μ g Placebo IFN- β 1b 5 MIU/m 2 22 μ g Placebo Placebo Placebo SC alternate days SC alternate days SC 3/week IM 1/week Primary outcome Time to EDSS progression: Time to EDSS progression: Time to EDSS progression: 2-year change in MSFC 1.0 step for EDSS 3.0-5.5 or 1.0 step for EDSS 3.0-5.5 or 1.0 step for EDSS 3.0-5.0 or 0.5 step for EDSS 6.0-6.5 0.5 step for EDSS 6.0-6.5 0.5 step for EDSS 5.5-6.5 sustained 3 months sustained 6 months sustained 3 months Ch04.qxd 9/1/04 6:32 AM Page 66"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"of IFN- β 1a on disability progression measured with EDSS. In the IMPACT Study, the primary endpoint for MS-related disability was the MSFC, although EDSS was included as a secondary endpoint. Active treatment resulted in significantly lower deterioration in MSFC scores in IFN- β 1a patients compared with placebo patients. No significant benefit was found for the timed 25-foot walk and only a tendency in favor of active treat- ment for the PASAT (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test), a measure of neuropsychological function. The treatment difference in the MSFC was mainly due to the 9- hole-peg-test, a measure of arm function. Because the MSFC is new, neurologists have less familiarity with the measure, and the clinical implications of the observed benefits are currently a matter of debate. Across all four SPMS studies, significant beneficial effects were observed for relapses and MRI markers of inflammation, but the effects on disability progression were mixed. Although the studies had similar inclusion criteria (Table 4.3), demographic and disease characteris- tics at baseline were different (Table 4.4). The European SPMS Study recruited younger patients and more patients with relapses superimposed on a progressive course. Only about 30% of the patients in this study were relapse-free during the 2 years preceding randomization, compared with around 50% for the other studies. Despite the differences in the proportions of relapse-free patients in the European SPMS Study and the SPECTRIMS Study (30% vs 55%), the proportion of relapse-free in the placebo groups during these two studies was nearly iden- tical (36% vs 37%). On the other hand, the proportion of relapse-free placebo patients during the North American Study and the IMPACT Study was much higher (62% vs 63%) (Table 4.4). It is impossible to determine how much of the difference is due to the patient population and how much is due to differences in methods for counting relapses. While both are likely to contribute, these find- ings again point out the limitations of relapses as an out- come measure, and further suggest that comparing relapse results across studies is not meaningful. One likely reason for greater efficacy observed in the European SPMS Study relative to other SPMS studies is the relatively short disease duration in the European SPMS Study. Mean disease duration ranged from 13.1 years in the European Study to 16.5 years in the IMPACT Study. Increasingly, there is evidence that inflammation may decline as a pathogenic mechanism in later stages of the disease, and that destructive and degenerative processes may become dominant. Therefore, it seems plausible that efficacy of an anti-inflammatory drug may decline as disease duration increases. The SPMS studies raise important questions about the impact of IFN- β on disability progression. The therapeutic effect size of IFN- β in SPMS on markers of inflammation (relapses and new MRI lesions) is similar to that seen in the RRMS studies, but there is relatively little impact on EDSS progression at this stage of the dis- ease. Since the trials are of short duration, it is possible that anti-inflammatory effects might translate into mean- ingful benefits on disability progression eventually, and that prolonged follow-up time would be required to measure this. Another possibility is that inflammation is no longer the predominant pathogenic factor at this stage of the disease, and inflammation-independent Slowing the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis 67 TABLE 4.4 Baseline Characteristics and Results from Phase 3 Studies of Interferon- β in SPMS.

Still another possibility is that more robust benefits of IFN- β on disability progression in RRMS are artifactual, and based on differences in the scale performance in mild vs more severely affected patients. Distinguishing among these possibilities would provide significant insights into MS pathogenesis. Mechanism of Action The mechanisms of action of interferon in MS are unknown. A number of laboratories have shown that interferon has beneficial effects in experimental autoim- mune encephalomyelitis, focusing attention on the immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory properties of interferon that may underlie therapeutic benefits in MS. The biological response to interferon is complex, how- ever, and it is not a simple matter to determine the effects most relevant to therapeutic benefits. Interferons generate biological responses by tran- scriptional regulation of a large family of genes. Hundreds of genes are known to be regulated by type 1 interferon. There is cell-type specificity to the inter- feron response, and the state of cell activation also determines responsiveness. It is not currently known which genes underlie therapeutic effects in MS, or what cell populations constitute the therapeutic target. Ransohoff (2003) reviewed biological responses to interferon as they relate to therapeutic efficacy, and Karp (2001) listed the most relevant immune effects (Table 4.5). Interferon is presumed to have anti-inflammatory effects in MS, as demonstrated by reduced gadolinium enhancement, and by CSF testing in the IFN- β 1a (Avonex) trial. Patients in that study had CSF analysis at study entry and after 24 months. Cell counts were signifi- cantly reduced in IFN- β 1a but not placebo recipients (Rudick et al ., 1996). Effects that may explain the anti- inflammatory outcome include: (1) interferon therapy was shown to increase soluble VCAM (Calabresi et al ., 1997), and this correlated with decreased gadolinium- enhancing lesions. Soluble levels of VCAM in the blood may compete with endothelial VCAM for VLA-4 on the surface of activated T cells, decreasing entry of activated T cells into the CNS; (2) interferon therapy was shown to increase intracellular levels of interleukin (IL)-10 (Liu et al ., 2001), and IL-10 levels in CSF (Rudick et al ., 1998b). Increased CSF IL-10 levels correlated with favor- able clinical outcomes in the IFN- β 1a study; (3) type 1 interferon was shown to lower levels of IL-12, and to 68 Slowing the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis TABLE 4.5 Selected Effects of Interferon β on the Immune System, Adapted from Karp et al.

This might promote an anti-inflammatory environment within the CNS; and (4) type 1 interferon was shown to inhibit inducible Class II expression, possi- bly reducing antigen presentation within the CNS (Lu et al ., 1995). Newer molecular approaches may shed light on thera- peutic mechanisms and individual response variability. Techniques such as microarrays (Sturzebecher et al ., 2003) and macroarrays consisting of gene transcripts known to be regulated by interferon (Schlaak et al ., 2002) are just beginning to be used for this purpose. Neutralizing Antibodies As is the case with many protein therapies, individual interferon recipients may develop neutralizing antibod- ies (NABs) to the drug. This was reported in the origi- nal Betaseron study, where development of NABs was associated with relapse rates and MRI lesion rates sim- ilar to placebo patients (The IFN-b Multiple Sclerosis Study Group, 1996). In the late 1990s, several groups demonstrated that interferon NABs were associated with blunted or absent in vivo responsive to interferon injections (Rudick et al ., 1998c; Deisenhammer et al ., 1999; Bertolotto et al ., 2003). These studies indicate that interferon NABs inhibit the biological response to therapy, and this explains why interferon patients who develop NABs have relapse and MRI disease activity similar to placebo-treated patients. The risk of develop- ing NAB is higher with IFN- β 1b compared with IFN- β 1a, and lower with IFN- β 1a (Avonex) compared with IFN- β 1a (Rebif). The differences are presumed due to different doses (lower with Avonex), different physical chemical properties (Betaseron is nonglycosylated), and different routes of administration (Avonex is given by IM injection; the other products are given subcuta- neously). The risk of NAB is one factor to be consid- ered in selecting an interferon product for use in MS patients. Identifying individual risk for NAB, optimal monitoring strategies, and managing patients with NABs are important research topics. Is One IFN Drug “Better”? Several companies market IFN- β products for MS. Based on public reports on second quarter sales in 2003, annual worldwide sales of IFN- β products are currently estimated to be $2.5 billion. Since the market is split between three drugs, there has been intense marketing for market share by pharmaceutical companies. Much of the marketing has focused on whether one of the products is superior, and this has taken many forms: physician and lay advocates, advertising, educational programs, and postmarketing studies. There has been a bewildering array of claims and counterclaims. The EVIDENCE Study (Panitch et al ., 2002) is a sig- nificant postmarketing study. Two preparations of IFN- β 1a, Rebif (44 μ g TIW) and Avonex (30 μ g QW) were compared in an open-label 6-month study. Patients with active RRMS who had not previously used an interferon product were randomized to one of the arms and moni- tored to determine relapse frequency and new MRI lesions. There were fewer relapse-free patients in the IFN- β 1a (Avonex) treated patients, and more new MRI lesions. However, the unblinded study design raised some concerns about the accuracy of the relapse findings, and the short study design raised questions about the signifi- cance of the findings (Kieburtz and McDermott, 2002). The observed benefits were considerably smaller in a sub- sequent 6-month observation period, suggesting that more frequent injections had a faster onset of action. Despite these issues, the EVIDENCE Study was impor- tant, because the FDA approved Rebif based on this study despite marketing exclusivity for Avonex under the Orphan Drug Act. The decision was based on FDA opin- ion that the EVIDENCE Study confirmed a significant advantage of Rebif compared with Avonex. The question of the optimal interferon product remains highly controversial in the MS field, despite the EVIDENCE Study. Comparisons across the three piv- otal trials suggest similar therapeutic effects, although precise comparisons are difficult. It is unclear whether short-term advantages of Rebif demonstrated in the EVIDENCE Study translate into long-term advantages, or whether they justify additional injections and toxicity. What Is the Impact of IFN- β on Inflammation/ Destructive Pathology, and Does Interferon Therapy Translate into Long-term Clinically Relevant Benefits? The demonstration that acute MS lesions contain large numbers of transected axons (Trapp et al ., 1998) and the findings that IFN- β inhibits new MRI lesions and reduces clinical relapses and CSF cell counts (Rudick et al ., 1998a) raise the possibility that IFN- β may be neu- roprotective. IFN- β may induce biological responses consistent with neuroprotective properties. For example, type 1 IFN reduces astrocytic production of nitric oxide, and hence may inhibit neuronal damage as has been shown in cell-culture (Schlaak et al ., 2002; Stewart et al ., 1997). IFN- β also induces expression of nerve growth factor by astrocytes (Boutros et al ., 1997). Indirect evidence based on MRI findings suggests that IFN- β may lessen destructive pathology in RRMS patients. Simon and colleagues reported that IFN- β 1a reduced accumulation of T 1 black holes in the Avonex Slowing the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis 69 Ch04.qxd 9/1/04 6:32 AM Page 69"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"RRMS study (Simon et al ., 2000). IFN- β 1a also had a stabilizing effect on T 1 black holes in the RRMS patients in the PRISMS study (Gasperini et al ., 1999). In patients with SPMS, IFN- β 1b was found to reduce the number of T 1 black holes. This was related to reduced new lesion formation, as the proportion of new lesions that evolved into T 1 black holes was similar in IFN- β 1b and placebo patients (Brex et al ., 2001). Rudick et al . (1999) reported that IFN- β 1a slowed whole brain atrophy progression in the second year of the original Avonex trial, as measured by the brain parenchymal fraction (Fisher et al ., 1997). Hardemeier et al . (2003) used the same BPF software in the dose com- parison study of IFN- β 1a (Avonex) for RRMS (Clanet et al ., 2002). This group found IFN- β 1a treatment was associated with significantly slower rates of whole brain atrophy progression. In that study, brain atrophy pro- gressed at a rate of approximately 1% per year from 4 months before treatment through 4 months after treat- ment onset. Between months 4 and 36 of therapy, atro- phy progressed at a significantly lower rate. BPF values and the rates of atrophy on IFN- β 1a therapy were quite similar in the original Avonex RRMS study and in the dose comparison study. Jones and colleagues (2001), on the other hand, applied a similar method to patients in the PRISMS trial, but failed to demonstrate a therapeu- tic benefit of IFN- β 1a (Rebif) on atrophy progression. Also, none of the studies of INF- β therapy in progressive MS has shown benefits on brain atrophy. Thus, the anti- inflammatory effects of IFN- β provide a basis for a neuroprotective effect, and MRI data are suggestive. However, not all RRMS studies have demonstrated a beneficial effect on brain atrophy, and studies in SPMS have thus far failed to demonstrate an effect of IFN- β on brain atrophy progression. Despite promising results from MRI studies and the logical conclusion that interferon treatment is neuropro- tective, the effects of IFN on clinically significant long- term disability progression remains controversial. An approach to this problem would be longer randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, but this is not practical for two reasons. First, prolonged use of a placebo group in RRMS is ethically questionable, because multiple randomized controlled clinical trials have demonstrated therapeutic benefits. Second, patients in a clinical trial are most likely to withdraw from the trial if they are doing poorly. If the more severely affected patients are lost to follow-up evaluation, and this occurs more in one arm of the study than the other, the results are increasingly unre- liable. Consequently, it is unlikely that long-term, ran- domized, placebo-controlled studies will be available to definitively assess the long-term impact of DMDT (dis- ease modifying drug therapy). The PRISMS-4 study demonstrated that those patients who were initially treated with placebo for 2 years failed to “catch up” to those initially treated with INF- β -1a (Rebif) after switch- ing to Rebif for the subsequent 2 years (PRISMS Study Group, 2001). The publication was accompanied by an editorial advocating early rather than delayed treatment (Schwid and Bever Jr, 2001). Therapeutic benefits beyond 4 years are not known, but follow-up data from the origi- nal IFN- β 1a (Avonex) study (Rudick et al ., 2001a) sug- gested that benefits are still evident 8.1 years after randomization in those patients initially randomized to active treatment. GLATIRAMER ACETATE (GA) FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Rationale and Early Trials Animal models of autoimmune demyelination have formed the basis for decades of productive research into mechanisms of autoimmunity relevant to MS pathogen- esis. The most important animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), is regarded as a relevant animal model for MS. EAE is a T-cell-mediated disease induced in susceptible animals by inoculation with components of the central nervous system. Purified myelin proteins, such as myelin basis protein (MBP), pro- teolipid protein, or even peptides derived from them, are encephalitogenic in susceptible animals. Glatiramer acetate (GA) was developed based on this model of the human disease. Dr. Ruth Arnon and col- leagues (1996) synthesized 11 copolymers with amino acid compositions similar to MBP, in order to obtain syn- thetic encephalitogens for EAE studies. The copolymers did not induce EAE, but unexpectedly several prevented EAE or reduced its severity. Copolymer 1 (Cop1), com- posed of L -glutamate, L -lysine, L -alanine, and L -tyrosine, was the most potent EAE antagonist, reducing the inci- dence of EAE in MBP-challenged guinea pigs by as much as 75% (Arnon, 1996). Cop1 also suppressed EAE in other species and biochemical studies demonstrated that the degree of cross-reactivity between Cop1 and MBP correlated with the ability of Cop1 to suppress EAE (Teitelbaum et al ., 1991). In the first clinical study, Bornstein and colleagues ran- domized 48 patients to Cop1 or placebo (Bornstein et al ., 1987) and determined the proportion relapse free. This study may have been the first to use an evaluating neurol- ogist masked to treatment arm assignment to improve the objectivity of the outcome assessment. Sixteen relapses occurred in Cop1 patients, with 62 in placebo patients. More Cop1 patients were relapse-free; placebo patients were more likely to have three or more relapses. Disability progression was defined as worsening by ≥ 1.0 point on the 70 Slowing the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Ch04.qxd 9/1/04 6:32 AM Page 70"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"disability status scale, sustained for 3 months. Cop1 treat- ment slowed disability progression using this definition. The drug was well tolerated, although 2 Cop1-treated patients reported flushing and chest tightness, sometimes accompanied by anxiety and dyspnea after their injections. These symptoms resolved within 30 minutes without sequelae. This exciting result set the stage for definitive studies of Cop1 in RRMS, but it would take more than 5 years to generate adequate drug of sufficient purity to initiate definitive studies. Definitive Trial in RRMS Teva Pharmaceuticals entered into an agreement to further develop Cop1 with the Weitzman Institute, where prior Cop1 work had been conducted. Considerable effort was required to standardize the manufacturing methods to provide the quantities of drug needed to con- duct a large-scale trial. The final product, thereafter called glatiramer acetate (GA), consisted of random, synthetic polypeptide chains ranging in molecular weight from 4000 to 13,000 daltons consisting of L -alanine, L -glutamate, L -lysine, and L -tyrosine in molar ratios of 4.2, 1.4, 3,4, to 1.0. A dose of 20 mg administered daily by subcutaneous injection was selected for the double- blind, placebo-controlled trial, which began in 1992. The trial was conducted at 11 MS centers in the United States (Johnson et al ., 1995). The primary out- come measure was the mean number of relapses in the study arms. Other prespecified outcome measures included other relapse-based endpoints, mean change in EDSS and ambulation index from baseline, and propor- tion of patients with sustained EDSS progression, defined as worsening by ≥ 1.0 from baseline EDSS per- sisting for at least three months. MRI scans were not included in the protocol. A total of 251 patients were randomized to GA or placebo, and the two groups were well matched for demographic and disease factors at baseline (Table 4.6). The patients in this study were simi- lar to patients in the pivotal interferon studies. There were 161 relapses in GA patients, and 210 in placebo patients. The mean annualized relapse rate was 0.59 for GA patients and 0.84 for placebo patients, a 29% reduction ( P < .01). Mean EDSS change was lower for the GA group compared to placebo ( P = .02), but there were no differences in ambulation index change, or in the number of patients with sustained EDSS change. Injection site reactions were the most reported common adverse event. The transient postinjection reaction first observed in the pilot trial occurred in 15% of GA patients, usually within seconds or minutes of an injec- tion. This 2-year pivotal trial confirmed that daily, subcu- taneous injections of GA reduced relapses in patients with RRMS. On this basis, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved GA (Copaxone) for RRMS in December 1997. Because patients in the blinded study were evaluated until the last patient completed 4 months, there was an average of 5.5 months additional data from the double- blind portion of the study. The 24-month data and the extension phase data were combined in a second report (Johnson et al ., 1998). In all, 215 (86%) of 251 random- ized patients completed 24 months, and 203 of the 215 entered the extension phase. In the extended study analy- sis, the mean annual relapse rate was 0.67 for GA patients and 0.99 for placebo patients, a reduction of 32% ( P < .01). At the end of the extension phase, 24.6% of the placebo group and 33.6% of the GA group were relapse- free from study onset ( P < .05). The extension study also failed to show significant benefits on the predetermined EDSS-based outcome, but a post hoc analysis showed that more patients developed a 1.5 point worsening from baseline EDSS at some point during the study. Studies in Progressive MS One trial for chronic progressive MS was conducted during the 1980s, using Cop1 obtained from the Weitzman Institute (Bornstein et al ., 1991). A total of 106 patients with documented disability progression were studied. The primary study endpoint was the time to confirmed worsen- ing ≥ 1.0 point from baseline EDSS for patients with base- line EDSS of 5.0 or greater and ≥ 1.5 points for patients with entry EDSS of less than 5.0. There was a trend for less progression in Cop1 patients compared to placebo (17.6% vs 25.5%), but this was not statistically significant. Further studies in SPMS have not been conducted. The PROMiSe trial (Wolinsky et al ., 2002) was a dou- ble-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the effect of GA in patients with primary progressive MS (PPMS). Accrual of 943 patients with PPMS for this trial represents a monumental accomplishment, given the rela- tive scarcity of patients with PPMS. Patients were 49% male, average age 50.4, and symptomatic an average of 10.9 years at study entry. They were moderately disabled with average EDSS of 4.9.

Thus, at present, there are no data suggesting a therapeutic effect of GA on disease progression in SPMS or PPMS. Mechanism of Action Possible mechanisms of action of GA have been reviewed (Neuhaus et al ., 2001) (Table 4.7). Commonly cited possibilities include: 1) competitive binding to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in preference to myelin protein antigens, 2) preferred binding of GA-MHC complexes over MBP-MHC complexes to T-cell receptors, 3) induction of tolerance in MBP-specific T-cells; and 4) induction of GA-specific T cells expressing anti-inflam- matory Th2 cytokines. GA treatment increases GA-spe- cific T cells in peripheral blood, which then decrease with continued GA administration (Duda et al ., 2000). GA- specific T cells may be polarized toward a Th2 bias, and secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines. Conceivably, GA- specific Th2-polarized T cells may recognize myelin anti- gens within the CNS and mediate bystander suppression. This mechanism was suggested in EAE studies (Aharoni et al ., 1998), and a study of eight MS patients initiating ther- apy with GA supports this possible mode of action (Qin et al ., 2000). GA and MBP reactive T-cell lines from GA- treated patients were characterized, using the ratio of IFN- γτο IL-5 as a measure of Th2 bias. GA-reactive lym- phocytes had a significant Th2 bias compared to MBP- reactive cells. Thus, the prevailing view is that GA functions as an antigen and induces proliferation of GA-reactive T cells. Thus, GA may be the first treatment of autoimmune disease thought to work via modulating specific T cell responses to autoantigen. Antibodies to GA form during treatment, but the impact is not known. A total of 130 patients from the RRMS GA clinical trial were studied for antibodies(Brenner et al ., 2001). Antibodies developed in all patients, peaked at 3 months of therapy, and declined to near baseline levels subsequently. The relevance of antibodies to GA with respect to the in vivo biological response to treatment or to treatment efficacy is currently not known. Impact on Inflammation / Destructive Pathology Compared with the interferons, relatively little is known about the impact of GA on destructive pathology in MS. The European/Canadian MRI Study was initi- ated in 1987 as a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trial designed to determine the MRI effect of GA (Comi et al ., 2001b). A total of 239 patients with active RRMS and at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion at study entry (selected from 485 potential sub- jects) were randomized to GA or placebo and studied under double-blind conditions for 9 months. After this phase, all patients were treated with GA in an open-label study for an additional 9 months. MRI scans were done monthly for 9 months, then every 3 months for the remaining 9 months. During the 9-month, double-blind phase, there were 29% fewer gadolinium-enhancing lesions in the GA treated group ( P < .01), and more gadolinium volume decline ( P = .01). The groups began to separate at month 5 and were significantly different in months 6 through 9. T 2 lesion accrual between entry and 9 months was 33% less in the GA group ( P < .01). Relapse rate, a secondary outcome in the study, was reduced by 33% ( P < .05). Compared to INF- β , GA effects on gadolinium- enhancing MRI lesions are modest and delayed, suggest- ing that GA has a different mechanism of action than interferon. Because the significance of MRI effects in terms of long-term clinical benefits is unknown, it is not valid to conclude that GA is less effective than IFN- β , although it suggests that the anti-inflammatory effect has a slower onset or is more modest. Also, the difference between the GA and IFN- β provides a rationale for com- bining the two treatments in combination protocols. The European/Canadian MRI Study examined the effect of GA on T 1 black holes (Filippi et al ., 2001). Each of 1722 gadolinium-enhancing MRI lesions from 239 patients was followed prospectively to determine the per- sistence of a T 1 black hole and the frequency of reen- hancement. Over the 9-month double-blind phase of the study, new gadolinium lesions could be tracked for up to 8 months. Fewer lesions evolved into T 1 black holes in GA-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients at 7 months (18.9 vs 26.3%; P = .04) and 8 months (15.6 vs 31.4%; P = .002). This finding was interpreted as 72 Slowing the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis TABLE 4.7 Potential Mechanisms of Action of Glatiramer Acetate in Multiple Sclerosis Parameter Reported Effects Binding to MHC Compete with MBP or other class II myelin antigens for T-cell binding (Fridkis-Hareli et al ., 1994; Fridkis-Hareli et al ., 1995) Binding to T-cell receptors Compete with myelin peptides for MHC binding (Aharoni et al ., 1999) Induction of tolerance Reduced T-cell-mediated brain in MBP-specific T-cells inflammation Induction of GA-specific Secretion of anti-inflammatory Th2 T cells cytokines in the brain Ch04.qxd 9/1/04 6:32 AM Page 72"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"showing a neuroprotective effect of GA. However, another analysis failed to show benefits of GA on brain volume change (Rovaris et al ., 2001). Using a semiautomated segmentation technique, brain volume was measured from seven contiguous periventricular slices from the scans obtained at baseline, the end of the double-blind phase, and the end of the study. Brain volume correlated with disability at each time-point, but no significant differences between placebo- and GA-treated patients were found for baseline brain vol- umes or for rate of brain volume change during the study. A trend toward slower atrophy progression dur- ing the second 9 months of the study (Rovaris et al ., 2001) is consistent with a delayed therapeutic benefit of GA on brain atrophy, but the differences in the study were not statistically significant, and the effects of GA on destructive pathology remain uncertain. Controversies and Future Directions with Antigen- Specific Therapy Double blind, placebo-controlled GA studies have not demonstrated significant benefit on sustained EDSS change (Bornstein et al ., 1987; Comi et al ., 2001b; Johnson et al ., 1995), but a meta-analysis, conducted by pooling data on 540 subjects within these clinical trials, demon- strated a significantly reduced odds ratio (OR = 0.57, P < .02) for ≥ 1.0 EDSS point worsening sustained for 90 days (Wolinsky et al ., 2003). In the meta-analysis time to sus- tained EDSS worsening was longer in GA-treated patients (ratio estimate 1.88, P < .02). Although not definitive, the meta-analysis suggests that GA may have therapeutic ben- efits on sustained EDSS worsening in RRMS. GA effects on disease progression have important implications for “antigen-specific” therapy in MS gener- ally. Two Phase II trials were conducted of an altered peptide ligand, synthesized based on encephalitogenic determinants of MBP (Bielekova et al ., 2000; Kappos et al ., 2000). These studies produced equivocal or negative results. The altered peptide ligand was accompanied by expansion of T cells reactive with the APL and with MBP (Kim et al ., 2002), and one of the trials (Bielekova et al ., 2000) suggested immune activation and increasing brain inflammation in some of the patients. HOW HAVE THESE STUDIES CHANGED MS, AND WHAT ARE KEY QUESTIONS RELATED TO FUTURE PROGRESS? The clinical trials described in this chapter have changed the face of the MS field. No longer is MS considered “untreatable,” and no longer are potential therapies considered “untestable.” Clinical trial method- ology has advanced with new disability measures, new MRI approaches for identifying destructive pathology, and new study designs. We have entered an era of active arm comparison studies in MS and trials of drugs used in combination. Most of the effort still focuses on anti- inflammatory therapies. However, anti-inflammatory drugs are being tested earlier in the disease process, based on the concept that inflammation is central to pathogen- esis early in MS, but that pathogenic factors not depend- ent on inflammation may play a larger role in later stages. Second, anti-inflammatory drugs are being used in com- bination. This approach is based on experience in other fields, (e.g., cancer therapeutics) that suggests a single drug may not be adequate to interrupt a complex disease. Attention is being directed at mechanisms of axonal and neuronal pathology in MS and at the use of neuropro- tection strategies. What Is the Best Way to Measure the Effects of MS Therapy? There is still no consensus about the best method for measuring therapeutic effects in MS, but it is abundantly clear that the traditional outcome measures—relapses and EDSS—are imprecise, used differently by different investi- gators, and do not allow interpretable comparisons of separate studies. Relapses are dependent on patient report- ing and neurologist interpretation, and are particularly questionable in studies that are not effectively blinded. This is a major problem for open-label studies comparing the effects of different interferon preparations on relapses, which can be influenced by expectations about the out- come by patients and investigators. As the field of experi- mental therapeutics in MS has matured, studies have gradually incorporated more meaningful clinical measures of disability progression, and more meaningful global MRI parameters such as atrophy, but acceptance of more meaningful measures has not been universal. A clear consensus was reported that traditional outcome measures are inadequate (Whitaker et al ., 1995). This led to an MRI task force (Miller et al ., 1996) that recommended protocols to standardize analysis of gadolinium-enhancing lesions in monitoring therapy in Phase I and Phase II stud- ies. This recommendation was generally accepted, and many trials have incorporated the recommendations. However, the relationship between gadolinium-enhancing lesion frequency and subsequent disability status was found to be fairly weak (Kappos et al ., 1999), as was the relation- ship between gadolinium enhancement and subsequent brain atrophy (Fisher et al ., 2000). Consequently, gadolin- ium enhancement has not been accepted as a validated sur- rogate for clinically meaningful outcomes, although it is widely used to screen anti-inflammatory therapies, and as a secondary outcome measure in pivotal trials. Slowing the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis 73 Ch04.qxd 9/1/04 6:32 AM Page 73"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The MS outcomes assessment workshop (Whitaker et al ., 1995) also led to a clinical outcomes assessment task force (Rudick et al ., 1997). The MS functional com- posite (MSFC) (Rudick et al ., 1996, 1997) was recom- mended as an improved clinical outcome measure for future clinical trials. The MSFC contains a walking test, a test of arm dexterity, and a cognitive test of sustained attention. Each of the three measures is standardized with scores from a reference population to create a z- score, and the z-scores for the three tests are averaged to create a single patient score. MSFC change over time along a continuous scale is easy to calculate.The MSFC was found to predict future disability status in patients with RRMS (Rudick et al ., 2001b) and in patients with SPMS (C ohen et al ., 2001). MSFC scores were found to correlate with MRI lesions and brain atrophy more strongly than does EDSS (Fisher et al ., 2000; Rudick et al ., 2002). The MSFC was reproducible in the context of a multina- tional trial (Cohen et al ., 2001), and was used as the primary outcome measure in the IMPACT Trial of IFN- β 1a in SPMS (Cohen et al ., 2002b). In that study, IFN- β 1a slowed MSFC worsening, but no benefits were observed using EDSS, presumably because EDSS is a less sensitive measure. Numerous ong oing studies have incorporated MSFC into the study designs, and much data are likely to emerge regarding the usefulness of MSFC in the near future. One potential advantage of MSFC is that it may be feasible to compare results across studies more mean- ingfully than with current measures. Because the MSFC component scores are standardized to a reference popula- tion and expressed as z-scores, and because consistent MSFC use is easy to achieve (Fischer et al ., 1999), it may be possible to directly compare therapeutic benefits from one study to another using MSFC. Another advantage of the MSFC is its sensitivity or responsiveness. This advan- tage may be particularly useful in detecting small incre- mental benefits, which will be useful in active arm comparison studies. Increasingly, there is a tendency to include newer MRI measures of destructive pathology in MS trials, and brain atrophy has received a lot of attention (reviewed in Miller 1998; Miller et al ., 2002). Many studies have been com- pleted using atrophy as one of the MRI outcomes (Rovaris and Filippi, 2003). As with MRI, there are many methods for demonstrating atrophy, and it is not prudent to com- pare different atrophy results derived from clinical trials using different measurement methods. Also, atrophy pro- gresses slowly over the course of years, so atrophy may not be a practical measure for short-term studies. Recently, Hardemeir et al . (2002) reported significant atrophy pro- gression during a 4-month interval before the IFN- β 1a (Avonex) dose comparison study. That result suggests that a reasonably short MS study targeting brain atrophy may be feasible. Other MRI methods, such as spectroscopy, magneti- zation transfer imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional imaging have not been widely applied to clini- cal trials, but hold great promise. What Is the Significance of Relapses with Respect to Eventual Disability Progression? The interferon studies demonstrated that anti-inflam- matory therapy in RRMS has significant beneficial effects on measures of brain inflammation: reduced fre- quency of relapses, reduced gadolinium-enhancing lesion frequency, and reduced T 2 lesions. These benefits are accompanied by less EDSS worsening in short-term clin- ical trials, raising the possibility that these short-term anti-inflammatory effects will significantly improve the long-term outcome in MS patients. However, the rela- tionship between relapse reduction and long-term bene- fits has not been demonstrated empirically. Confavreux reported the relationship between relapses and EDSS change observed in a large database of MS patients studied longitudinally (Confavreux et al ., 2000, 2003). Worsening from EDSS scores of 4 to higher levels did not differ in groups with or without prior relapses, or in patients with or without continuing relapses. These studies suggest that patients who enter the progressive disability stage worsen whether or not they continue to have relapses, and irrespective of the prior occurrence of relapses. This study has stimulated debate about the rele- vance of relapses to disability progression, or even the relevance of inflammation to ultimate disease pathogen- esis. It seems likely that brain inflammation is pathogenic and contributes to eventual disability progression, but that brain inflammation during the RRMS stage eventu- ally leads to a self-perpetuating neurodegenerative process that becomes independent from continuing inflammation. In this model, patients in the progressive stage of disease would deteriorate irrespective of ongo- ing anti-inflammatory therapy, which is consistent with the observations from the SPMS clinical trials. Another possibility is that brain inflammation might be secondary to an undefined underlying pathological process. If that were true, studies using more aggressive anti-inflamma- tory therapy early in the disease may not prevent pro- gressive disability progression. Currently, ongoing or planned trials of aggressive early anti-inflammatory drug therapy will help distinguish between these possibilities. Do Short-term Effects of Current Therapy on Measures of Inflammation Translate into Meaningful Long-term Benefits in MS? There are no long-term follow-up studies to answer this question. However, in a group of patients reevaluated 74 Slowing the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Ch04.qxd 9/1/04 6:32 AM Page 74"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"approximately 6 years after the end of a 2-year clinical trial, clinically meaningful benefits were evident in the original IFN- β 1a group compared with the original placebo group (Rudick et al ., 2001a). Also, systematic fol- low-up evaluation over 4 years in another study of IFN- β 1a (PRISMS Study Group, 2001; Schwid and Bever, 2001) demonstrated that earlier treatment resulted in sig- nificant benefits at the final follow-up evaluation com- pared with treatment delayed 2 years. The clinical significance of sustained EDSS progression during the relapsing stage of MS was assessed in the original IFN- β 1a (Avonex) study (Rudick et al ., 2001b). Of 172 patients randomized to the trial early enough to complete 2-year follow-up evaluation, data were available for 160 patients 8.1 years after randomization. Among the 160 patients, there were 45 patients with disability pro- gression during the 2-year clinical trial, and 115 without disability progression, defined as 6-month sustained EDSS worsening from baseline by ≥ 1.0. Table 4.8 shows the status at the 8-year follow-up evaluation in these patients. Patients with disability progression during the 2- year clinical trial had worse EDSS at the follow-up evalu- ation (6.1 vs 3.7; P < .001); worse MSFC scores ( − 2.66 vs − 0.44; P < .001); and more brain atrophy (BPF 0.79 vs 0.81; P = .06). This study supports the clinical meaning- fulness of disability progression as defined in this study, but such validation studies have not been reported for other definitions of disability progression or for relapse rate reduction. It seems likely, however, that clinical bene- fits of IFN- β 1a on sustained EDSS progression during the short-term trials would translate into clinically signif- icant benefits over the longer term. While there is evidence that IFN- β can slow whole brain atrophy, and that IFN- β reduces EDSS worsening in short-term studies in RRMS, it is also clear that many patients on IFN- β therapy continue to deteriorate. Also, IFN- β does not have a robust disability benefit in patients with SPMS. Why is this? One possibility is that IFN- β has only partial anti-inflammatory effects. If this were the case, combinations of anti-inflammatory drugs would be expected to more significantly affect disease progressi on, and such studies are in progress. Another possibility is that there is a window of opportunity for anti-inflammatory drug therapy, beyond which a neurode- generative process becomes somewhat autonomous. This possibility would predict that adequate anti-inflammatory therapy administered early enough would abort the pro- gressive stage of the disease. Follow-up evaluation of the patients entering trials at the first clinical episode (CHAMPS and ETOMS Studies) may provide insight into this hypothesis, as will aggressive immunosuppression with mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, CAMPATH, or stem cell transplantation at very early stages of MS. Another less optimistic hypothesis is that inflammation is a response to underlying neuronal or axonal pathology. If this were the case, fully effective anti-inflammatory ther- apy applied at disease onset may not prevent eventual dis- ability progression. Axonal or Neuronal Pathology Has Emerged as a Key Pathological Process. Is This a Result of Brain Inflammation, or Are There Other Mechanisms? Considerable attention has focused on axonal transec- tion and chronic axonal degeneration since the observa- tions by Trapp et al . (1998) and commentary by Waxman (1998). Axonal transection and degeneration cannot be measured directly in vivo . However, proton MR spec- troscopy allows in vivo measurement of n-acetylaspartate (NAA), providing a biochemical index of axonal integrity, reviewed in Stefano et al . (2000). Several MS studies demonstrated sustained decreases in NAA in white matter lesions and in brain regions appearing nor- mal on conventional MRI, suggesting diffuse axonal pathology in brain that appears otherwise normal. Studies demonstrated clinical relevance of decreased NAA (Pan et al ., 2001) and suggested that diffuse axonal pathology may exist at an early MS stage (Cifelli et al ., 2002; De Stefano et al ., 2001; Filippi et al ., 2003). Some (Narayanan et al ., 2001) but not other (Parry et al ., 2003) studies suggest that IFN- β treatment improves NAA lev- els. Studies focusing on the mechanisms of neuronal injury in MS, methods for measuring and monitoring this in patients, and methods for determining the effects of neuroprotective therapy are urgently needed. The Concepts of Subclinical Disease and Disability Threshold Affect Future Designs and Clinical Care During the past 20 years, the concept of subclinical disease and the “disability threshold” have been gener- ally accepted. Subclinical disease has been amply demonstrated by MRI studies showing new lesion for- mation and brain atrophy progression during early stages of MS in patients without relapses or other Slowing the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis 75 TABLE 4.8 Status of Patients from the IFN- β 1a (Avonex) Study at 8-Year Follow-Up Evaluation Depending on Progressor Status During 2-Year Clinical Trial Non-Progressors Progressors * P Value EDSS 3.69 + / − 2.0 (n = 115) 6.13 + / − 2.2 (n = 45) < .001 MSFC − 0.44 + / − 1.5 (n = 98) − 2.66 + / − 2.8 (n = 37) < .001 BPF 0.81 + / − 0.03 (n = 96) 0.79 + / − 0.03 (n = 38) = .06 * Patients who worsened by ≥ 1.0 from baseline EDSS, sustained for at least 6 months during original clinical trial.

This clearly implies that an MS patient may be clinically stable despite con- siderable disease activity and progression. The implica- tions for clinical trials and patient management are clear: One can be lulled into a false sense of security by monitoring only clinical manifestations. Clinical trials in this stage of MS must include imaging studies, and imaging is increasingly used for managing individual patients. The disability threshold is illustrated in Figure 4.1. In this conception, MS is a continuously progressive dis- ease, but progressive neurological disability ensues only after the disease burden has surpassed a threshold. Beyond that threshold, further pathology progression directly translates into progressive clinical deterioration. Where Are We Going with Clinical Trials after the ABCR Drugs? The ethical basis for placebo-controlled trials in RRMS must be given careful consideration (Lublin and Reingold, 2001). Important issues include informed con- sent, availability of effective drugs, duration of the trial, and adequate monitoring for disease worsening. In lieu of placebo-controlled trials, combinations of drugs will be compared with active therapy. Some such trials are underway (Rudick et al ., 2003). They require very large sample sizes, more sensitive outcome measures, or some combination of the two. Trials of intensive immune sup- pression or bone marrow transplantation may be initi- ated at very early stages of MS. It is hoped that outcome assessment in MS will advance to the point that the specific effects of neuro- protective agents, alone or in combination with anti- inflammatory drugs, can be determined. Transplantation of progenitor or stem cells will be possible, but it will be necessary to have more sensitive and specific methods to determine the result. Studies in PPMS and SPMS will continue to be sig- nificant, but therapeutic interventions other than anti- inflammatories will be needed. These alternatives should be based on emerging mechanistic insights into neurode- generation in MS. Finally, there is a strong need for skilled clinical inves- tigators in the MS field. Improved outcome measures and their validation will not be provided by the pharma- ceutical industry. Ideally, collaborations among clinical investigators, government, and the pharmaceutical industry will promote refinement of MS trial methodol- ogy, so that as our understanding of disease mechanisms improves, we will have more useful methods to study the effects of attractive therapies.

The history of the develop- ment of surgical treatment for epilepsy, based on a scien- tific understanding of epileptogenic etiologies, is in essence the history of localization of function within the brain (Engel, 1993a). Early scientific investigations into the organization of brain activity informed neurologists and neurosurgeons about the areas of cortex to be resected, while the study of focal epilepsy and of the brain during surgical treatment for epilepsy provided much of the information that enabled early neuroscien- tists to determine the topography of essential human cerebral functions. This sociohistorical perspective pro- vides several lessons that are generally applicable to the emergence of multidisciplinary collaborative neuroscien- tific research today. To understand the enormous contri- butions of the early pioneers of epilepsy surgery, not only to the treatment of epileptic seizures, but also to the development of the field of neuroscience, it is important to appreciate the primitive context in which these con- ceptual advances were made. In the mid-nineteenth century, people with epilepsy were still viewed as possessed and suffered as much from the occult treatments of well-meaning physicians as they did from their seizures (Temkin, 1945). Trephining, cau- terization, and castration were commonly used and were still mentioned as credible interventions in William Gowers’ (1881) textbook Epilepsy and Other Chronic Convulsive Disorders . Most physicians only recognized generalized tonic-clonic ictal events as epileptic seizures, and these were believed to originate in the medulla oblon- gata. Other types of epileptic seizures were referred to as “epileptiform” or considered manifestations of mental illness. The first antiseizure drug, bromide, was intro- duced as a treatment for women with epilepsy by a soci- ety physician, Charles Locock (1857), because it was believed to suppress libidinous behavior and hysteria. Phenobarbital did not appear as a treatment until 1912 (Hauptmann, 1912). Indeed, until the 1980s, all antiepilep- tic drugs were discovered serendipitously, or by trial and error. Only recently have antiepileptic compounds been designed to treat specific cellular and subcellular epilep- togenic mechanisms, revealed to a large extent by basic research on the human epileptic brain carried out in an epilepsy surgery setting (Meldrum, 1997). Prevalent beliefs about localization of brain function at the end of the eighteenth century were influenced by the introduction of phrenology in Vienna by Franz Josef Gall (1800) (Figure 5.1A). Gall maintained that com- partmentalization of cerebral activity produced bumps on the skull and that personality types could be diag- nosed by palpation of the head (Figure 5.1B). Phrenology was subsequently so vehemently debunked that the scientific community rejected any attempt to res- urrect concepts of cerebral localization for almost half a century. It was a British philosopher, Herbert Spencer (Figure 5.1C), who powerfully restored respectability to the view that function might be localized within the human brain: “Localization of function is the law of all organizations whatever: separation of duty is universally accompanied with separateness of structure; and it would be marvelous were an exception to exist in the cerebral hemispheres” (Spencer, 1855). Spencer’s writings on this subject had a major influence on John Hughlings 81 CHAPTER 5 The Emergence of Neurosurgical Approaches to the Treatment of Epilepsy Jerome Engel, Jr, MD, PhD Ch05.qxd 9/1/04 6:33 AM Page 81"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Jackson (Fig. 5.2A), generally recognized to be the father of modern epileptology (Young, 1990). HUGHLINGS JACKSON AND THE CONCEPT OF LOCALIZATION OF FUNCTION The English literature credits Jackson, who began his appointment at London’s National Hospital for the Paralyzed and Epileptic at Queen Square in 1862, with the recognition that focal seizures are also epilepsy, that these ictal events result from localized discharging cortex, and that the best way to understand the fundamental mecha- nisms of epilepsy is to study their focal manifestations. Others before Jackson, including the Englishmen Pritchard (1822) and Bright (1831), and the German Griesinger (1867), had studied focal “epileptiform” events, but did not make the clear connection with epilepsy. The Frenchman Bravais (1827) was the first to describe local- ized postictal paresis, although the phenomenon was sub- sequently named after the Irishman Todd (1856). Jackson’s contributions were seminal because he was a keen observer of clinical behavior, and because he correlated his detailed descriptions of focal ictal signs and symptoms with the anatomical location of specific lesions of the brain identi- fied postmortem (Jackson, 1880; Jackson and Colman, 1898; Taylor, 1958). These studies were the foundation for early understanding of the location of normal functions in the human brain, but they also had important clinical applications. Eventually, by direct observation and detailed descriptions of the initial ictal clinical features of patients with focal epilepsy, Jackson was often able to predict where in the brain the seizures began, and therefore where the offending pathological lesion could be found if a neuro- surgeon were brave enough to open the skull. The first report of successful surgical removal of epilep- togenic lesions, at a time when antiseptic and anesthetic techniques were all but nonexistent, was that of Benjamin Winslow Dudley (1828) of the Transylvania University Medical School in Lexington, Kentucky. Dudley reported on five surgical procedures performed between 1818 and 1828 to correct palpable traumatic skull defects that were causing epileptic seizures. All five patients survived, three became seizure free, and two had marked improvement, which Dudley attributed to the clean air of Kentucky. He commented that these results would not have been possi- ble in an unhealthy urban environment. The concept of utilizing neurological signs and symp- toms to localize an otherwise “invisible” cerebral lesion was first used for surgical intervention by the French surgeon Pierre-Paul Broca (1861) (Fig. 5.2B). Based on his post- mortem examination of brains from patients with expres- sive aphasia, Broca localized motor language to the area of the left frontal operculum now named after him, and later correctly located and removed an “invisible” extradural abscess in an aphasic patient; however, the patient died. Faradic stimulation in animals also contributed impor- tantly to nineteenth century concepts of localization of cerebral function and to confirmation of observations made by clinical neuroscientists. The Germans Gustav Theodor Fritsch and Edward Hitzig (1870) used faradic stimulation to map the dog motor cortex, and, in London, David Ferrier (1873, 1874a, 1874b, 1875, 1883) (Figure 5.2C) carried out faradic stimulation of cortex in several animal species, including monkey, to reproduce the ictal behavior described by Jackson in patients. In a preview of things to come, the ethics of Ferrier’s research on monkeys was viciously attacked by British antivivisec- tionists; however, he urged surgeons to use his data to localize resectable epileptic lesions (Ferrier, 1883). 82 The Emergence of Neurosurgical Approaches to the Treatment of Epilepsy FIGURE 5.1 A: Franz Josef Gall (1758-1828).

Bartholow was also severely criticized for his ethics. By the late 1800s, when advances in antiseptic and anesthetic techniques made surgery on the brain more commonplace, William Macewen (1879) (Figure 5.2D) of Glasgow reported the first resection of an “invisible” lesion to treat epilepsy, based on Jackson’s clinical approach to localization. The patient was relieved of his focal motor seizures after successful removal of a frontal meningioma, and Macewen (1881, 1888) went on to pub- lish a series of neurosurgical procedures guided entirely by clinical findings. Although Bennett and Godlee (1884) in London and Durante (Horsley, 1884) in Italy had also performed surgery for epilepsy earlier, Victor Horsley (1886) (Figure 5.2E) is credited with initiating the modern era of epilepsy surgery, after operations on three patients with partial seizures at London’s National Hospital in 1886, which he published that same year. Horsley had also carried out stimulation experiments on monkeys and worked closely with Jackson and Ferrier, who were both present in the operating theater for these landmark proce- dures. These three men heralded the essential multidisci- plinary epilepsy surgery team of a neurosurgeon, neurologist, and electrophysiologist, which still exists today. Why Horsley, and not Macewen, is generally rec- ognized as the initiator of modern epilepsy surgery may be due to his important teamwork with Jackson and Ferrier, who also deserve credit for bringing this new therapeutic approach to fruition, or it may merely reflect the British disdain for Scots at the time. The latter hypoth- esis is perhaps supported by Jackson’s quip to Ferrier after closure of the cranial vault on the first patient, who came from Scotland, that Horsley had missed the oppor- tunity to put a joke in a Scotsman’s head (Taylor, 1987). EARLY APPROACHES AND LESION-DIRECTED SURGERY By the turn of the twentieth century, a few European surgeons were operating on carefully selected patients with intractable focal epilepsy, following the course set by Macewen and Horsley. The most active epilepsy surgery programs were in Germany, where Feodor Krause (1909; Krause and Heyman, 1914) in Berlin and Otfrid Foerster (1925) (Figure 5.3A) in Breslau used Jacksonian localiza- tion concepts to determine where to perform the cran- iotomy, and intraoperative electrical stimulation to help determine the extent of neocortical removal. Surgical resection, however, was always primarily aimed at remov- ing a visible cortical scar or other obvious lesion. Foerster is particularly recognized in the history of epilepsy surgery for his most famous pupil, Wilder Penfield (Fig. 5.3B), who brought these concepts of lesion-directed surgery for intractable epilepsy to Montreal in 1928, and founded the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) in 1934. Penfield not only introduced epilepsy surgery to the Western Hemisphere, but also realized the importance of creating a multidisci- plinary team of neuroscientists who were among the first to use the potential of the epilepsy surgery setting to per- form invasive research on human brain function. In addi- tion to carrying out intraoperative electrocortical stimulation for localizing the epileptogenic region, Penfield and his colleagues (Penfield and Erickson, 1941; Penfield and Jasper, 1954) also used stimulation as a research tool to explore normal cortical function. They 84 The Emergence of Neurosurgical Approaches to the Treatment of Epilepsy FIGURE 5.3 A: Otfrid Foerster (1873-1941). B: Wilder Penfield (1891-1976).

The MNI was also to become the most important center for clinical advances in epilepsy surgery for many decades. Lesion-directed epilepsy surgery was greatly enhanced by the development of roentgenographic techniques, par- ticularly pneumoencephalography (Dandy, 1919) and cerebral angiography (Moniz, 1934). With the advent of these diagnostic tests, some “invisible” lesions of the brain could actually be seen before surgery, and their identification served not only to confirm localization obtained from ictal semiology but also to provide crucial localizing information, even when ictal and interictal signs and symptoms were equivocal. During the first half of the twentieth century, local- ized resective surgery for epilepsy was confined to small numbers of well-selected patients with clear evidence of a visible focal lesion; however, a few neurologists and sur- geons pursued hypotheses that other surgical interven- tions might be beneficial for patients with intractable epilepsy. Among the various interventions attempted, corpus callosotomy, first performed by William van Wagenen and Yorke Herren (1940) in the United States, and hemispherectomy, first performed by Kenneth McKenzie (1938) of Canada (who did not fully publish his work), followed by Rowland Krynauw (1950) in South Africa, were proven to be effective and have endured until the present. Krynauw was also the first to pursue surgical therapy for childhood epilepsies. THE IMPACT OF ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY AND THE EMERGENCE OF TEMPORAL LOBE SURGERY Arguably, the most important advance in the develop- ment of modern surgical treatment for epilepsy was the advent of electroencephalography (EEG) as a laboratory The Emergence of Neurosurgical Approaches to the Treatment of Epilepsy 85 FIGURE 5.4 Location of the motor ( left ) and sensory ( right ) homunculus on a cross-section of the human brain.

Richard Caton (1875), a physiologist in Liverpool, first showed that electrical activity could be recorded directly from the brains of ani- mals, but no one published attempts to obtain similar recordings from the intact scalp until Hans Berger (1929) (Figure 5.5A) of Jena published his first article on the human EEG. Perhaps because Berger worked alone in an isolated environment (Gloor, 1969; Millett, 2001), few believed the data reported by the German psychiatrist, and even fewer realized the potential diagnostic value of the first objective laboratory measures of cerebral func- tion. Not until Lord Adrian (Adrian and Matthews, 1934), an internationally renowned neurophysiologist, confirmed Berger’s work and demonstrated the alpha rhythm live on stage during a scientific meeting, did the medical community eventually accept this ground- breaking discovery. Berger never received the credit he deserved for this landmark achievement during his lifetime and eventually committed suicide. It is difficult to appreciate today the impact EEG must have had on the fledgling field of neuroscience at a time when objective measures of brain activity in intact awake and performing animals and humans was thought to be an unobtainable dream. Electrophysiology rapidly became the preeminent discipline for basic research into mechanisms of brain function, and EEG became the symbol for this entire field of investigation. Indeed, before the founding of the Society for Neuroscience in 1970, the American EEG Society was the premier society for neuroscience research in the world, and similarly Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology was the premier neuroscience journal. In both cases, the terms EEG and electroencephalography were used not to specify a particular diagnostic test, but to symbolize an entire field of modern functional neuroscience (Herbert Jasper, personal communication). The pioneer electroencephalographers Frederick and Erna Gibbs (Figure 5.5B), along with one of the most prominent early American epileptologists, William Lennox (Figure 5.5C), first described EEG patterns that clearly distinguished among three ictal events: grand mal, petit mal, and psychomotor seizures (Gibbs et al ., 1938). The Gibbses, however, used only linked-ear common ref- erence recording for their EEG investigations and there- fore believed that all three patterns were generalized. In Montreal, Herbert Jasper (Figure 5.5D) and John Kershman recognized the temporal location of epilepti- form EEG events recorded from patients with psy- chomotor epilepsy because they used bipolar chain montages. They correctly concluded that for psychomo- tor seizures, and for other focal seizures, it was the initial location and not the pattern of the EEG discharges that provided the most important diagnostic information. Although temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common form of human epilepsy, among the most refractory to pharmacotherapy (Semah et al ., 1998; Engel, 1998a), and the most amenable to surgical therapy (Engel et al ., 1993), until the mid-twentieth century, epilepsy surgery was limited to resections of lesions of neocortex. Ammon’s horn sclerosis, however, had been recognized more than a century earlier by C. Bouchet and Jean- Baptiste Cazauvieilh (1825) of Paris, who reported that it was a common postmortem finding in patients with “mental alienation” seizures. Jackson (Jackson, 1880; Jackson and Colman, 1898) knew by the end of the nineteenth century that epilepsy with an “intellectual aura” or “dreamy state” and “tasting movements” was associated with lesions in mesial temporal structures. This prescient observation was in part the result of Jackson’s study of his most famous patient and friend, Dr. Z (Taylor and Marsh, 1980). At about the same time, the Germans Wilhelm Sommer (1880) and E. Bratz (1899) independently described the cellular pathology of hippocampal sclerosis (Figure 5.6), but proposed that this was the result, not the cause, of epileptic seizures. Gowers (1881), who exercised considerable influence over the neurological community, at least in England, maintained that the hippocampus had nothing to do with the cause of epilepsy. Thus, no early neurosurgeons had ever attempted to remove mesial temporal structures, which they considered terra incognita . It was the EEG that eventually led the field of epilepsy surgery to the mesial temporal lobe. Based on scalp and intraoperative direct-brain EEG recordings, Jasper (1941) concluded that the ictal mani- festations of psychomotor seizures originate in the tem- poral lobe and wrote this in a chapter of a textbook by Penfield and Erickson (1941), in which Penfield, in a sep- arate chapter of the same book, stated that the origin of psychomotor seizures is unknown and that: “When an encephalograph” (meaning pneumoencephalogram) “shows no evidence of a lesion, either atrophic or expandin g..., any operative procedure is probably doomed to turn out to be a negative exploration.” This clear evidence that Penfield did not seriously apply the observations of his colleague Jasper in his first published series of surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy (Penfield and Flanigin, 1950) explains why the article by Frederic Gibbs, who had moved to Chicago, and the neurosur- geon Percival Bailey (Figure 5.5E), published a year later, is considered to be the first series of temporal lobe sur- geries for epilepsy based on scalp EEG evidence alone (Bailey and Gibbs, 1951). Penfield and Flanigin (1950) reported on 68 patients who underwent temporal lobe resections for epilepsy and, a year later, Jasper et al . (1951) published the com- plete electrophysiological findings in these patients, 86 The Emergence of Neurosurgical Approaches to the Treatment of Epilepsy Ch05.qxd 9/1/04 6:33 AM Page 86"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The Emergence of Neurosurgical Approaches to the Treatment of Epilepsy 87 FIGURE 5.5 A: Hans Berger (1873-1941).

In the same year, Bailey and Gibbs published results from a series of 25 patients who received temporal lobe resections based entirely on scalp EEG evidence of localization (Bailey and Gibbs, 1951). By this time the Gibbses (Gibbs et al ., 1948) had been using unilateral referential electrodes and had replaced the active ear, so they could lateralize and localize parox- ysmal EEG events to one temporal lobe. They were then able to convince Bailey to operate on the basis of EEG evidence alone. Although his colleague Jasper had made the same EEG observations during the period of Penfield’s 68 temporal lobe resections reported in 1950, Penfield continued to rely on evidence of structural abnormalities for localization (Herman Flanigin, per- sonal communication). Again, credit appears to go to the 88 The Emergence of Neurosurgical Approaches to the Treatment of Epilepsy FIGURE 5.6 Wood-carved plate from Bratz (1899) showing cells in a normal ( top ) and sclerotic epileptic ( bot- tom ) hippocampus.

After the Bailey and Gibbs demon- stration that EEG activity could be used to localize the epileptogenic region in this most common form of epilepsy, there was an explosion in surgeries for temporal lobe epilepsy in Europe (Falconer, 1953; Guillaume et al ., 1953; Paillas et al ., 1953; Petit-Dutallis et al ., 1953; Maspes and Marossero, 1953; Obrador , 1953; Kr ayenbuhl et al ., 1953), the United States (Green et al., 1951; Morris, 1956), and Cuba (Picaza and Gumá, 1956). Anterior tem- poral resections became, and remain, the most common surgical procedure used as a treatment for epilepsy. In 1950, the neurosurgeon Arthur A. Morris (1950) presented a series of five patients at a meeting in Washington, DC, who underwent temporal resections based on localization from EEG. This preliminary pres- entation may have been an incentive for Bailey and Gibbs to publish their surgical series quickly. More important, however, is that Morris (1956) removed the anterior hip- pocampus and amygdala, whereas previous surgeons had been afraid to injure the hippocampus. All of the patients in the Bailey and Gibbs (1951) series, and all but two in the Penfield and Flanigin (1950) series, underwent bigyrectomies or trigyrectomies, leaving the mesial struc- tures intact, with relatively poor results by present-day standards; only about one third of patients became seizure free. It might be argued, in retrospect, that these results were largely a placebo effect, given that surgery, even outside the brain, made seizures better (Penfield, 1936). Perhaps if it had not been for the placebo effect, temporal lobe surgery would not have been pursued. In any event, once it was demonstrated that it was safe to remove the hippocampus and perihippocampal struc- tures, which Jasper had shown were most often the gen- erators of interictal and ictal epileptiform discharges in patients with psychomotor seizures (Jasper and The Emergence of Neurosurgical Approaches to the Treatment of Epilepsy 89 FIGURE 5.7 Direct intraoperative recording from the mesial temporal lobe during a clinical complex partial seizure produced by electrical stimulation of the uncus.

An unfortunate historical footnote is the logical extension of this surgical direction, when Scoville treated his famous patient, H.M., with bilateral hippocampal resections, rendering him globally amnesic (Scoville and Milner, 1957). Resected mesial temporal specimens, although removed piecemeal, appeared to reveal hippocampal sclerosis (Earle et al. , 1953). Subsequently, most neuro- surgeons included mesial temporal structures in their anterior temporal resections and Murray Falconer (1953) (Figure 5.8A), in London, introduced a standardized en bloc anterior temporal lobectomy procedure that pro- vided large intact tissue specimens for pathologists to examine. The resulting clinicopathological correlations not only demonstrated that a high percentage of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy have hippocampal sclerosis but also that this pathological finding predicted an excel- lent postoperative outcome (Falconer and Serafetinides, 1963; Falconer and Taylor, 1968). Although evidence continued to mount that hippocampal sclerosis could result from epileptic seizures, such as prolonged febrile convulsions in early childhood, the fact that its removal could cure epilepsy eventually convinced most epileptol- ogists that hippocampal sclerosis was also a cause of temporal lobe epilepsy (Falconer, 1974). Various noninvasive EEG techniques using nasopha- ryngeal (Gastaut, 1948; Grinker, 1938; MacLean, 1949; Roubicek and Hill, 1948), tympanic (Arellano, 1949), and sphenoidal (Jones, 1951; Pampiglione and Kerridge, 1956; Pertuiset and Capdevielle-Arfel, 1951; Rovit and Gloor, 1960) electrodes were used to distinguish mesial temporal from lateral temporal interictal and ictal events more accurately; however, direct intraoperative recording from the brain was considered to be more reliable, and EEGers began to pursue approaches to extraoperative invasive recording. Reginald Bickford and Hugh Cairns first carried out such direct recordings from the human brain at Oxford in 1944 by inserting multistranded insu- lated wires into a cerebral bullet track. Bickford et al . (1953) later was the first to publish the results of depth electrode recording from the Mayo Clinic, when he placed electrodes freehand through the skull for both recording and stimulation. Jean Talairach (Figure 5.8B) and Jean Bancaud (Figure 5.8C) introduced stereotactic depth electrode placement in Paris in the late 1950s, but French law permitted them to record for only several hours (Talairach et al ., 1958, 1974). Consequently, local- ization with this stereo EEG technique was based on interictal spike activity, as well as ictal activity induced by electrical stimulation and convulsant drugs. Paul Crandall and colleagues at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) (Crandall et al ., 1963) (Figure 5.8 D ), were the first to report on the use of truly chronic stereotactically implanted depth electrode recordings to localize the onset of spontaneous ictal EEG events. Crandall combined analyses of the electro- physiological features of spontaneous temporal lobe seizures with the en bloc anterior temporal resection of Falconer, permitting detailed electropathological correla- tions. This investigative approach became the basis for the innovative multidisciplinary collaborative research on fundamental mechanisms of human epilepsy that is pro- ductively pursued at many epilepsy surgery centers today (Crandall and Babb, 1993; Engel, 1998b; Engel et al ., 1987; Schwartzkroin, 1993a). The investigative team involves not only neurosurgeons, neurologists, electro- physiologists, and neuropathologists, but also basic sci- entists committed to finding rational therapies for epilepsy that will make surgery no longer necessary. Furthermore, Crandall deserves credit for recognizing the potential of EEG telemetry technology, which was being developed at the time at UCLA by Ross Adey and colleagues (1956) to record from chimpanzees orbiting the earth as part of the U.S. space program. With Richard Walter, Crandall demonstrated the ability of telemetry to yield artifact-free continuous EEG record- ings from depth electrodes over long periods and estab- lished the first epilepsy EEG telemetry unit (Dymond et al ., 1971). Crandall’s electronic engineer, Tony Dymond, eventually founded BioMedical Sciences, the first manu- facturer of commercial EEG-telemetry systems. Subsequent advances in EEG presurgical evaluation included the use of photography, cinematography, and then video, for simultaneously monitoring behavior and obtaining detailed second-by-second electroclinical cor- relations of ictal onset and propagation (Ajmone- Marsan and Ralston, 1957; Hunter and Jasper, 1949; Penry et al ., 1975; Schwab et al ., 1953; Goldensohn, 1966). This was followed by the application of long-term video and EEG monitoring techniques to obtain nonin- vasive scalp and sphenoidal recordings (Engel et al ., 1981; Ives and Gloor, 1978), semi-invasive foramen ovale (Wieser, 1986) and peg (Barnett et al ., 1990) electrode recordings, and a variety of other chronic invasive recordings using epidural (Goldring and Gregorie, 1984) and subdural (Lüders et al ., 1987) electrodes. Although EEG has excellent temporal resolution, spa- tial resolution is severely limited. Localization within centimeters can be inferred from scalp and sphenoidal EEG recordings, but epileptiform activity in the depths of the brain, particularly in mesial temporal structures, is not recorded from the scalp unless it propagates to superficial cortex. Intraoperative and chronic extraoper- ative intracranial recordings using intracerebral depth 90 The Emergence of Neurosurgical Approaches to the Treatment of Epilepsy Ch05.qxd 9/1/04 6:33 AM Page 90"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"electrodes or electrode arrays over the cortical surface monitor only limited areas of the brain and are subject to sampling error. A variety of computerized techniques were developed to automatically detect epileptiform events (Gotman, 1981) and to localize the sources of their dipoles noninvasively (Ebersole, 1997). The accu- racy of dipole source localization remains limited by the facts that (1) multiple dipole sources can give rise to iden- tical surface-recorded signals, (2) dipole models do not account for distributed sources, and (3) epileptiform events that cannot be recorded from the scalp remain undetected. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is gaining increasing application for presurgical evaluation as a result of certain advantages over routine EEG for calcu- lating the location of dipole sources for epileptiform events in three dimensions, because magnetic signals are not altered by passage through structures of different density, such as brain, cerebral spinal fluid, bone, and skin (Barth et al ., 1984). Dipole source localization of interictal and ictal epileptiform abnormalities obtained by MEG and superimposed on the patient’s own mag- netic resonance imaging (MRI) scan now reveal, in some patients, that apparently diffuse or multifocal scalp EEG events have a single site of origin (Eliashiv et al ., 2002). MEG, therefore, is becoming increasingly useful for plan- ning chronic intracranial electrode explorations when multiple source localization hypotheses are possible, and perhaps, in a few cases, MEG data can be used to avoid the need for invasive recording. THE IMPACT OF ASSESSING NONEPILEPTIC ASPECTS OF CEREBRAL FUNCTION Neurocognitive testing is an important part of mod- ern presurgical evaluation. Neuropsychological batteries are based largely on Brenda Milner’s (Figure 5.9AB) description of material-specific functions of the left and right temporal lobes obtained from studies of large num- bers of patients who underwent anterior temporal lobe The Emergence of Neurosurgical Approaches to the Treatment of Epilepsy 91 FIGURE 5.8 A: Murray A.

The discipline of neuropsychology has benefited enormously from studies of patients with focal epilepsy in an epilepsy surgery setting, both before and after surgical resection. Neurocognitive test batteries, therefore, are used to provide evidence of focal func- tional deficit, confirming mesial temporal or neocortical localization obtained from clinical, EEG, and neu- roimaging evaluations. Extraoperative lateralization of hemispheric domi- nance for language was first demonstrated in Japan by Juhn Wada (1949) (Figure 5.9B), who injected sodium amobarbital into one carotid artery, anesthetizing half of the forebrain so that the other half could be examined independently. The intracarotid amobarbital procedure, or Wada test as it is commonly called, was not known or accepted in the West for more than a decade, until Wada repeated his studies at the MNI (Wada and Rasmussen, 1960). A modified version of the intracarotid amobarbi- tal procedure that permits independent evaluation of memory functions of the dominant and nondominant mesial temporal structures has become important in the presurgical evaluation for intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. This test is used to predict the risk of global amnesia resulting from the inability of the contralateral hemisphere to support memory (Klove et al ., 1969; Milner et al ., 1962) and to confirm dysfunction in the mesial temporal structures intended for resection (Engel et al ., 1981). Psychiatrists have long been involved in the care of patients with epilepsy, particularly in the United Kingdom, where epileptologists tended to be psychia- trists, rather than neurologists, until very recently. David Taylor (Figure 5.9C), a British psychiatrist who also was the first to describe focal cortical dysplasia as a cause of neocortical epilepsy (Taylor et al ., 1971), deserves credit for observing that people with epilepsy seek treatment not merely to eliminate their epileptic seizures but to relieve the predicament caused by these recurrent ictal events (Taylor, 1993). To assess the outcome of surgery in 100 patients operated on by Falconer, Taylor actually vis- ited their homes and assessed the impact of seizure free- dom or reduction on activities of daily living (Taylor, 1972), a tour-de-force that has been repeated only once since (Bladin, 1992). Taylor emphasized the need to listen to patients’ reasons for wanting surgical treatment and to require realistic expectations as part of the decision-mak- ing process. Taylor’s work and subsequent studies by many others have led to the conclusion that effects of surgical inter- vention, for better or worse, should not be measured by seizure outcome alone, but rather by the impact of seizure freedom or reduction on quality of life. Although most studies of surgical treatment for epilepsy now incorporate quantitative measure of health-related qual- ity of life (Vickrey, 1992; Devinsky et al ., 1995), neu- ropsychological and psychiatric evaluations, as well as a number of other assessments of activities of daily living such as employment and schooling, domiciliary status, and ability to drive, are necessary to determine why scores on quality of life tests change after surgery. Consequently, neuropsychologists, psychiatrists, and health outcome researchers are an essential part of today’s epilepsy surgery teams; their contributions help to predict which patients are likely to benefit from sur- gery, to asses the full impact of surgical outcome on patients’ lives, and ultimately to optimize opportunities for improved quality of life in patients who become seizure free. Furthermore, research by many psychiatrists in the epilepsy surgery setting has greatly advanced our understanding of the biological basis of behavioral disorders (Taylor, 2003). 92 The Emergence of Neurosurgical Approaches to the Treatment of Epilepsy FIGURE 5.9 A: Brenda Milner (1918-).

Persistent neurological signs and symptoms elicited during history and a detailed neuro- logical examination can suggest the presence of a struc- tural lesion that could be epileptogenic. Transient postictal focal neurological dysfunction lasting hours to days provides insight into the location of ictal onset. Intermittent and continuous focal EEG slowing and focal attenuation of faster frequencies, seen on scalp and sphenoidal EEG and more commonly with intracerebral EEG recording, can be important for defining the loca- tion and extent of the epileptogenic region. The intra- venous thiopental test, developed by W.A. Kennedy and Dennis Hill in London, was used in association with sphenoidal EEG recording to identify attenuation of barbiturate-induced beta activity in the epileptogenic mesial temporal lobe (Kennedy and Hill, 1958). This technique is still used occasionally during intraoperative electrocorticography to define the extent of a neocortical functional disturbance. Intraoperative functional cortical mapping is neces- sary to avoid introducing new neurological deficits when suspected neocortical epileptogenic regions involve, or are adjacent to, areas of essential function such as lan- guage or motor cortex (Ojemann et al ., 1993). In the early days of epilepsy surgery, the operation was per- formed under local anesthesia because cortical mapping was necessary before cortex could be removed. Today, intraoperative cortical mapping using direct cortical stimulation and recording of evoked potentials can be carried out with the patient under general anesthesia or, depending on the modalities under investigation, with the patient briefly awakened in the operating room. Cortical mapping is also commonly an extraoperative procedure using chronic subdural grid electrodes (Lüders et al ., 1987). Occasionally, these studies also provide evi- dence of aberrant localization of function, which can help define the abnormal epileptogenic neocortex. Since the early work of Penfield and Jasper (1954), intraopera- tive functional mapping of neocortex in the course of surgical treatment for epilepsy has continued to provide research opportunities for important investigations into the anatomical substrates of uniquely human behaviors such as language (Ojemann, 1991). CONCEPTS OF THE EPILEPTOGENIC ZONE: SETTING THE STAGE FOR COMPUTERIZED NEUROIMAGING By 1980, strategies for epilepsy surgery were guided by a number of independent diagnostic approaches for determining the area to be resected (Engel et al ., 1981). Surgical treatment for focal epilepsy requires not only accurate localization of the epileptogenic region but also demarcation of the extent of tissue necessary for genera- tion of spontaneous seizures to determine the bound- aries of the resection. Electropathological correlations made possible by the combination of depth electrode studies and en bloc anterior temporal resections led to the description of a common pathophysiological substrate for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, which resulted in the widespread acceptance of standardizing the surgical pro- cedure for this condition (Crandall, 1987). Although the size and shape of the standardized anterior temporal resection has varied over time and from one surgical pro- gram to another ranging from selective amygdalohip- pocampectomy (Niemyer, 1958; Wieser, 1986) to a slightly larger anteromesial temporal resection (Spencer et al ., 1984), to the older Falconer resection (Falconer, 1953; Crandall, 1987), which involves more lateral tem- poral cortex, the presurgical evaluation for this proce- dure merely needs to confirm that the epileptogenic region is within the area of standard resection (Engel, 1987). Localized neocortical resections, on the other hand, are always tailored, and the presurgical evaluation must also reveal the extent of the epileptogenic region (Engel, 1987b). The epileptogenic zone , defined as the area of brain tissue necessary and sufficient for generat- ing spontaneous seizures and therefore the minimal resection required to achieve freedom from seizures, is a hypothetical concept determined from a variety of presurgical studies (Lüders et al ., 1993). Extensive electroclinical correlations, made possible by video-EEG telemetry, greatly improved on Jackson’s original observations, and clues to the epileptogenic zone can be obtained from analysis of initial ictal semiology. The cortical areas giving rise to initial ictal signs and symptoms, the symptomatic zone , however, is not neces- sarily the site of ictal onset (Lüders et al ., 1993). Seizures often begin in silent areas of the brain, and initial signs and symptoms reflect propagation. For instance, patients and observers usually are unaware of hippocampal ictal discharges until they propagate to neocortical or dien- cephalic areas. Not only is the spatial resolution of EEG relatively poor, but areas generating interictal epileptiform events, the irritative zone , are usually much larger than the epileptogenic zone (Lüders et al ., 1993). The exact site of ictal onset, the ictal onset zone , can be difficult to deter- mine even with intracranial recording and usually pro- vides insufficient information concerning the actual volume of tissue necessary for spontaneous seizure generation (Lüders et al ., 1993). Before computerized functional neuroimaging, the focal functional deficit zone , determined by interictal neu- rological examination and neurocognitive testing, could The Emergence of Neurosurgical Approaches to the Treatment of Epilepsy 93 Ch05.qxd 9/1/04 6:33 AM Page 93"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"provide useful information only when the epileptogenic region involved cortical areas responsible for behaviors that can be measured such as motor, language, and mem- ory function (Lüders et al ., 1993). Large association areas were not testable and spatial resolution was also poor. Before computerized structural neuroimaging, routine radiological studies, including plain skull films, cerebral angiography, and pneumoencephalography, provided important information regarding the location of a struc- tural lesion in some patients, but the evidence from these tests was often circumstantial and not all structural lesions are necessarily epileptogenic. Although the presurgical evaluation effectively used all of these diagnostic approaches to approximate the location and boundaries of the epileptogenic zone, there was a great need for new diagnostic techniques that could display structural and functional features of the entire brain, in three dimensions, with high spatial resolution. This was achieved with the advent of computerized neu- roimaging. THE IMPACT OF COMPUTERIZED NEUROIMAGING AND THE RETURN TO LESION-DIRECTED SURGERY X-ray computed tomography (CT) was the first com- puterized tomographic approach to visualizing the entire brain in three dimensions. Application to patients with focal epilepsy revealed localized structural lesions in many (Gastaut and Gastaut, 1976), and greatly improved selection of potential surgical candidates for localized resection, particularly of alien tissue lesions. The devel- opment of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) greatly improved resolution of discrete structural lesions that might be epileptogenic, particularly disorders of cortical malformation, such as focal cortical dysplasia, making lesion-directed surgery increasingly possible in patients who, in the past, would have been diagnosed as having cryptogenic focal epilepsy and considered to be poor sur- gical candidates. The resolution of MRI, however, was considered to be insufficient to image hippocampal scle- rosis, the most common pathological substrate of epilepsy, until a small, hyperintense hippocampus was convincingly observed at the MNI in 1985 (Andermann, 1987) (Figure 5.10A) but not published until much later (Jackson et al ., 1990). Subsequently, tremendous improvements in identifying potentially epileptogenic structural abnormalities in patients with intractable focal epilepsy, using modern structural neuroimaging, greatly increased the number of patients who could be consid- ered surgical candidates (Cascino and Jack, 1996; Kuzniecky and Jackson, 1995). EEG continues to be nec- essary, however, to show that an identified structural lesion is, in fact, epileptogenic. Patients with medically intractable focal epilepsy occasionally have structural lesions that are unrelated to the epileptogenic region, or multiple or diffuse structural abnormalities of which only a small part is epileptogenic and requires excision. With the ready availability and increasingly high resolu- tion of MRI, the focus of epilepsy surgery is again becoming lesion-directed, as it was in the early part of the twentieth century, with EEG assuming a confirma- tory, although still essential, role. The first computerized neuroimaging technique to play a major role in presurgical evaluation for temporal lobe epilepsy was not a structural imaging technique, but a functional imaging technique. At UCLA beginning in 1978, positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), which measures local cere- bral glucose metabolism, revealed that most patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy had unilateral temporal hypometabolism (Engel et al ., 1981, 1982a, 1982b, 1982c; Kuhl et al ., 1980) (Figure 5.10B). Unilateral temporal lobe hypometabolism corresponded to the site of ictal EEG onset, as well as a mesial temporal structural lesion identified postoperatively, usually hippocampal sclerosis. This finding not only helped to identify surgical candi- dates but obviated the need for invasive studies in many patients (Engel et al ., 1981). Unilateral temporal hypo- metabolism, in association with an ipsilateral sphenoidal ictal EEG onset, and confirmatory localization from tests of focal functional deficit, in the absence of con- flicting findings from seizure semiology and structural and functional investigations, permitted effective tempo- ral lobe surgery without depth electrode recording. FDG-PET, therefore, increased the numbers of patients who could be treated surgically and greatly reduced the cost and risk of presurgical evaluation. FDG-PET was also useful in identifying large unilat- eral areas of cortical dysplasia in infants and small chil- dren with apparent catastrophic secondary generalized epilepsy and a negative MRI (Chugani et al ., 1988). Multilobar resections in these children, who are other- wise destined for institutionalization, can eliminate life- threatening seizures and reverse developmental delay (Mathern et al ., 1999). FDG-PET, however, did not often reveal areas of focal hypometabolism in adult patients with neocortical epilepsy who did not already have obvi- ous structural lesions on MRI (Henry et al ., 1991). Improved PET localization in cryptogenic focal neocorti- cal epilepsy has been achieved using flumazenil, a benzo- diazepine receptor ligand, as a tracer; however, this technique is not widely available (Savic et al ., 1988). Another tracer, α -methyl-tryptophan (AMT), may also be useful in localizing certain epileptogenic areas in patients with widespread or multiple structural lesions (Chugani et al ., 1998). For instance, in tuberous sclerosis 94 The Emergence of Neurosurgical Approaches to the Treatment of Epilepsy Ch05.qxd 9/1/04 6:33 AM Page 94"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"with multiple tubers, only the tuber giving rise to sponta- neous seizures appears to take up AMT. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) revealed decreased cerebral perfusion in epilep- togenic temporal lobes with somewhat lower spatial reso- lution than PET, but this finding may be falsely localizing (Bonte et al ., 1983; Sanabria et al ., 1983). The demonstra- tion of unilateral temporal lobe hyperperfusion on ictal SPECT, however, more reliably localized the epileptogenic region in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy; and with injection later during the postictal period, there is profound lateral temporal hypoperfusion with residual mesial temporal hyperperfusion (Lee et al ., 1986; Rowe et al ., 1991). Localized areas of hyperperfusion on ictal SPECT scans during focal neocortical seizures are more difficult to inter- pret but have become more reliable with the use of statis- tical parametric mapping to subtract ictal from interictal scans, and to superimpose these data onto the patient’s own MRI scan (SISCOM) (O’Brien et al ., 1998). Functional MRI (fMRI) makes use of the natural differences in magnetic properties between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin to localize activity- related changes in cerebral blood oxygenation with high spatial resolution and second to millisecond temporal resolution. Consequently, it is possible to image func- tional activation in discretely localized areas of the brain during seizures (Jackson et al ., 1994) and the occurrence of interictal EEG spikes (Krakow et al ., 1999; Warach et al ., 1996). The ability to record EEG during MRI acqui- sition permits MRI data acquired during interictal spikes to be subtracted from MRI data acquired between interictal spikes, and the difference to be super- imposed on the patient’s own structural MRI scan. Interictal EEG spikes are of limited localizing value because some interictal spikes represent propagated activity, and others represent epileptiform events origi- nating in brain areas that are not sufficiently epilepto- genic to generate spontaneous seizures; however, there is reason to believe that fMRI may be able to distinguish between spikes originating in the epileptogenic zone (red spikes) and interictal spikes that are falsely localizing (green spikes). In vivo microelectrode recordings from epileptic hippocampi of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and animal models of this disorder have revealed that interictal spikes originating from the area of seizure generation are associated with very high fre- quency (250-600 Hz) oscillations, termed Fast Ripples. These do not appear with interictal spikes that are prop- agated or arise from areas where spontaneous seizures have not been recorded (Bragin et al ., 1999; Staba et al ., 2002). This indicates that the fundamental neuronal mechanisms underlying red spikes may be sufficiently different from the mechanisms causing green spikes to permit their metabolic correlates to be distinguished with fMRI. EEG-fMRI remains a research technique because of the limited number of centers with the ability to record EEG during MRI at the present time; however, specialized EEG equipment for this purpose may soon become commercially available, and much more exten- sive clinical application will then be possible. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is yet an- other application of MRI to localize areas of structural The Emergence of Neurosurgical Approaches to the Treatment of Epilepsy 95 FIGURE 5.10 A: One of the first MRI scans to reveal mesial temporal sclerosis as a hyperintense atrophic hip- pocampus.

MRS can be used to measure a variety of meta- bolic processes with a temporal resolution of a few minutes, much better than PET, but not as good as fMRI. It is most often used in epilepsy to identify areas of reduced n-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), which com- monly accompanies the cell loss of hippocampal scle- rosis. There also is evidence to suggest that reduced NAA is reversible in some circumstances and therefore a reflection of functional disturbances associated with the epileptogenic region as well (Guye et al ., 2002). The use of a number of MRS measurements, including NAA, glutamine, glutamate, γ -aminobutyric acid transaminase, phosphorous, lactate, and pH to localize areas of epileptogenic dysfunction is currently under investigation. Optical imaging is a dynamic invasive technique that makes use of the fact that light passing through brain tissue is altered by changes in neuronal activity. Optical imaging of the human neocortex during epilepsy sur- gery has revealed areas involved in electrical stimula- tion-induced afterdischarges as they propagate across the brain surface, with remarkable structural and tem- poral resolution (Haglund et al ., 1992a). Optical imag- ing can be accomplished in animals through a thin skull, and it is conceivable that techniques eventually will be developed that overcome the thickness of the human skull, permitting noninvasive imaging of ictal and interictal epileptiform abnormalities. Clinical appli- cation of optical imaging in epilepsy, however, remains hypothetical. IMPACT OF THE CREATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL EPILEPSY SURGERY COMMUNITY The first Palm Desert conference on Surgical Treatment of the Epilepsies, held in 1986, brought together representatives from 53 epilepsy surgery pro- grams in 17 countries (Engel, 1987a). They represented essentially all active epilepsy centers offering surgery as a treatment for epilepsy. At the time, only one textbook on epilepsy surgery was available (Purpura et al ., 1975), and there were several different schools of thought concerning approaches to surgical therapy (Engel, 1987b), and very little collaboration or even exchange of information among centers comparing these various approaches. Furthermore, there was no standardized approach to the evaluation of surgical outcome, and results reported in the few published articles of epilepsy surgery series could not be easily correlated. The charge of admission to the conference was data from each epilepsy surgery program in a relatively uniform format which, despite the diverse approaches, revealed consistent results with respect to surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy and focal neocortical epilepsy (Engel, 1987c) (Table 5.1). Most epilepsy surgery teams pursued only one par- ticular approach, depending on their lineage (Appendix II, 1987). Those who trained at the MNI under Penfield and Jasper and their successors (Rasmussen, 1983), and later at the University of Washington (Dodrill et al ., 1986), based surgical excisions largely on the results of intraoperative electrocorticography, and all resections were tailored. Those who trained in Paris under Bancaud and Talairach and their colleagues (Munari et al ., 1985) carried out extensive, predominantly unilat- eral, stereotactic depth electrode evaluations in almost every patient; and all resections were tailored based on results of invasive studies, except in Zürich (Wieser, 1986), where only amygdalohippocampectomies were performed after invasive presurgical evaluation. Those who trained at the Maudsley in London under Falconer and his colleagues (Powell et al ., 1985) performed stan- dardized anterior temporal resections based largely on the results of interictal noninvasive EEG recordings, and although they routinely performed intraoperative electrocorticography, they rarely used these data to alter the temporal resection. Those who trained at UCLA with Crandall and his colleagues (Cahan et al ., 1984) also performed standardized anterior temporal resec- tions, but these were based on results of ictal EEG onset patterns recorded with bilateral chronic depth elec- trodes, and intraoperative recordings were not used for temporal lobe surgery. Later, however, before the Palm Desert meeting, the UCLA protocol changed consider- ably to rely more heavily on scalp and sphenoidal video- EEG telemetry, FDG-PET, and other tests of focal functional deficit to perform standardized anterior tem- poral resections without requiring invasive recordings (Engel et al ., 1981). At Yale almost all patients contin- ued to be studied with depth electrodes before stan- dardized anterior temporal resection (Spencer et al ., 1982), and at the Cleveland Clinic, tailored resections were based on interictal and ictal data obtained from chronic subdural grid electrode recordings (Lesser et al ., 1987). Clinical pathological correlations were difficult at centers where tailored resections were performed and tissue from the epileptogenic region often was removed by suction. Centers that performed en bloc surgical resections had better opportunities for pathological evaluation, but their findings could not be universally confirmed. From the discussions at this conference, it became apparent that no particular approach was necessarily better than another; rather, each had advantages and disadvantages that made it superior for certain types 96 The Emergence of Neurosurgical Approaches to the Treatment of Epilepsy Ch05.qxd 9/1/04 6:33 AM Page 96"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"of epilepsy and inferior for others. As a result, between 1986 and 1992, most epilepsy surgery programs began to adopt approaches used at other centers for particu- lar purposes (Appendix II, 1993). For instance, centers that always performed chronic invasive recording began to limit these studies to patients with specific diagnostic problems, while centers that never per- formed chronic invasive recording began to do so when indicated. Most centers began to use stereotactically implanted depth electrodes for mesial temporal epilepsy but would often use subdural grid electrodes for focal neocortical epilepsy when it was necessary to determine not only the location, but the extent of the epileptogenic region. Although computerized structural and functional neuroimaging was just beginning, the exceptional poten- tial of these diagnostic techniques for localizing epilep- togenic abnormalities in patients with medically intractable focal epilepsy was readily appreciated. The creation of an epilepsy surgery community in 1986 resulted in a much more universal collaborative approach to the application of these diagnostic tech- nologies among epilepsy surgery centers than had occurred with the application of other new diagnostic techniques in the past. Neuropsychologists also began to compare notes on the use and interpretation of specific neurocognitive batteries and the intracarotid amobarbi- tal procedure, and shared information led to increasingly similar strategies from one epilepsy surgery center to another. Finally, a standardized classification for sur- gical outcome with respect to epileptic seizures was agreed on and subsequently used for most published reports (Engel, 1987c). Interest in epilepsy surgery burgeoned in the late 1980s, spurred in part by the enthusiasm for more proactive and cooperative efforts engendered at the first Palm Desert conference, and in part by the advent of higher resolution structural and functional neuroimag- ing that greatly improved the identification of potential surgical candidates. At the same time, there was a resur- gence of interest in some older surgical techniques such as corpus callosotomy (Spencer et al ., 1987) and hemi- spherectomy (Rasmussen, 1987), which were discussed at the first Palm Desert conference, and the introduc- tion of two new surgical procedures, multiple subpial transection (Morrell et al ., 1989) and lesionectomy (Kelly, 1988), which offered a reasonable probability of seizure remission without additional neurological deficit when the epileptogenic region involved essential cortical areas. The second Palm Desert conference on Surgical Treatment of the Epilepsies, held in 1992, documented the tremendous progress made in the 5 years between 1985 and 1990 with respect to improved diagnostic technology, as well as microsurgical techniques (Engel, 1993b). The increased application of epilepsy surgery was reflected by representation from 118 epilepsy surgery centers in 25 countries, essentially a doubling of active epilepsy surgery programs in 6 years. Each center again brought its data, and the number of patients undergoing surgery between 1985 and 1990 was 8234, compared to 3446 patients for the entire period before The Emergence of Neurosurgical Approaches to the Treatment of Epilepsy 97 TABLE 5.1 Outcomes before 1985 and from 1986 to 1990 Not Seizure-free Improved Improved Total Limbic resections Before 1985 1296 (55.5) 648 (27.7) 392 (16.8) 2336 (100) 1986-1990 ATL 2429 (67.9) 860 (24.0) 290 (8.1) 3579 (100) AH 284 (68.8) 92 (22.3) 37 (9.0) 413 (100) Neocortical resections Before 1985 356 (43.2) 229 (27.8) 240 (29.1) 825 (100) 1986-1990 ETR 363 (45.1) 283 (35.2) 159 (19.8) 805 (100) L 195 (66.6) 63 (21.5) 35 (11.9) 293 (100) Hemispherectomies Before 1985 68 (77.3) 16 (18.2) 4 (4.5) 88 (100) 1986-1990 H 128 (67.4) 40 (21.1) 22 (11.6) 190 (100) MR 75 (45.2) 59 (35.5) 32 (19.3) 166 (100) Corpus callosotomies Before 1985 10 (5.0) 140 (71.0) 47 (23.9) 197 (100) 1986-1990 43 (7.6) 343 (60.9) 177 (31.4) 563 (100) ATL, anterior temporal lobectomy; AH, amygdalohippocampectomy; ETR, extratemporal resection; L, lesionectomy; H, hemispherectomy; MR, large multilobar resection.

Furthermore, the percentage of patients who became free of disabling seizures after temporal lobe resections improved from 56% to 68% between 1985 and 1990, and many more patients than in the past were undergoing localized neo- cortical resections, hemispherectomies, multilobar resec- tions, and corpus callosotomies, with excellent results (Engel et al ., 1993b, c) (Table 5.1). The designation of surgically remediable epilepsy syndromes (Engel, 1996) was a major conceptual advance, introduced at the second Palm Desert confer- ence at the suggestion of the psychiatrist David Taylor. Given that the number of antiepileptic drugs was increasing to the point where it might take years, and possibly a lifetime, to prove medical intractability, it was no longer reasonable to consider surgery for epilepsy as a treatment of last resort. Rather, early surgery was recommended for surgically remediable epilepsy syn- dromes, which are conditions with a relatively well- known pathological substrate, a natural history characterized by medical refractoriness after failure of the first few appropriate drug trials, and a progressive course including development of behavioral distur- bances if seizures are not controlled (Engel, 1996). The final criterion for a surgically remediable epilepsy syn- drome is a high probability of complete control of dis- abling seizures, on the order of 70% to 90%, with surgical intervention, which can also prevent develop- ment of irreversible adverse psychological and social consequences, including developmental delay in infants and small children, if surgery is performed early. Early surgical intervention for surgically remediable epilepsy syndromes is not only desirable to achieve the best outcome but is also cost-effective because the presurgical evaluation can usually be performed nonin- vasively, and few patients fail to benefit from treatment. The prototype of a surgically remediable epilepsy syn- drome is mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, more often due to hippocampal sclerosis than to other mesial temporal lesions (Engel et al ., 1997). Patients with this condition are among the most refractory to medical treatment and at risk for disabling interictal behavioral disturbances, either as a result of the social and psychological conse- quences of frequent seizures, or because direct biological effects of repeated ictal events cause progressive memory deterioration, as well as depression and other mental dis- orders (Engel et al ., 1991). Patients with medically intractable focal seizures resulting from discrete resectable neocortical lesions also have a surgically reme- diable epilepsy syndrome. A number of surgically remediable epilepsy syn- dromes in infants and small children are due to diffuse structural abnormalities limited to one hemisphere, such as Sturge-Weber syndrome, hemimegencephaly, large porencephalic cysts, and Rasmussen’s encephalitis (Andermann et al ., 1993). In these conditions, antiepilep- tic medications are ineffective in controlling frequent seizures, which cause progressive behavioral disturbances and can be life-threatening. If these children survive, they commonly develop mental retardation and require per- manent institutionalization; however, early hemispherec- tomy or hemispherotomy can completely eliminate disabling seizures and reverse developmental delay, with- out introducing additional unacceptable neurological deficits in most patients who already have hemiparesis and a useless hand (Schramm, 2002). In some patients with extensive structural abnormalities that do not involve the motor cortex, and who do not have hemi- paresis, large multilobar resections can achieve the same results without introducing a new motor deficit (Leiphart et al ., 2001). EPILEPSY SURGERY TODAY AND IN THE FUTURE Since 1986 there have been numerous other confer- ences on epilepsy surgery, and many books and mono- graphs have been published on this topic (e.g., Apuzzo, 1991; Bingaman, 2002a, 2002b; Dam et al ., 1988, 1994; Duchowny et al ., 1990; Elisevich and Smith, 2002; Engel, 1987a, 1993b; Lüders, 1992; Lüders and Comair, 2001; Mathern, 1999; Pickard et al ., 1990; Silbergeld and Ojemann, 1993; Spencer and Spencer, 1991; Theodore, 1992; Tuxhorn et al ., 1997; Wieser and Elger, 1987; Wyler and Hermann, 1994; Zentner and Seeger, 2003). A ran- domized controlled trial of surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy was finally completed in 2001 (Wiebe et al ., 2001), and in 2002 the American Academy of Neurology issued a practice parameter recommending surgery as treatment for this disorder (Engel et al ., 2003). The presurgical evaluation for surgically remediable epilepsy syndromes, particularly mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, has been simplified to a point where it can be used in regions with relatively limited resources. Surgical therapy is now being offered in a number of developing countries (Wieser and Silfvenius, 2000), where it may be more cost- effective than continued antiepileptic drug treatment for well-selected patients in these areas. Emphasis placed on surgical treatment for the recog- nized surgically remediable epilepsy syndromes in recent years should not detract from the value of surgical inter- vention for other intractable epileptic conditions that may not fall into this category. This includes patients with cryptogenic epilepsy who have electroclinical features suggestive of a single epileptogenic zone, although there is no history or imaging evidence of a structural lesion, and patients with diffuse or multifocal structural abnor- malities in whom a smaller resectable area might be 98 The Emergence of Neurosurgical Approaches to the Treatment of Epilepsy Ch05.qxd 9/1/04 6:33 AM Page 98"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"responsible for disabling spontaneous seizures. These patients currently require invasive evaluation with either depth or subdural electrodes, or both, and the chances for complete freedom from disabling seizures is not as good as it is for those with surgically remediable syn- dromes (Engel, 1996). Despite increased cost and risk, the reasonable expectation of better seizure control, if not complete seizure control, and an improved quality of life dictates the need to consider surgical intervention in these patients as well. However, further trials of antiepileptic drugs may be more appropriate before con- sidering surgery than in patients with surgically remedia- ble epilepsy syndromes, while hasty, inappropriate surgery can preclude a future effective intervention if new experimental diagnostic techniques, such as fMRI and MEG, eventually can localize the epileptogenic region more accurately. Not only has multiple subpial transection and lesionectomy increased opportunities for surgical treat- ment in patients whose epileptogenic zone involves essen- tial cortical areas, but also there is some evidence that multiple subpial transection, performed unilaterally or bilaterally, may prevent or reverse the disabling progres- sive verbal agnosia and other language disturbances associated with the Landau-Kleffner syndrome (Morrell et al ., 1995). Another rare, highly refractory epileptic condition is gelastic epilepsy, which is often associated with a hypothalamic hamartoma. Recent studies now suggest that these seizures actually begin within the hamartoma (Munari et al ., 1995) and that they may be controlled by removal of this tumor (Rosenfeld et al ., 2001). Gamma knife surgery is now being used for some types of focal epilepsy, and although results may not be as good as those of resective surgery and it can take up to a year for seizures to resolve, this intervention offers hope for patients with difficult-to-approach epileptic lesions and medical conditions that contraindicate cran- iotomy (Regis et al ., 1995). Research on new surgical techniques involving deep brain stimulation, delivered either repetitively (Velasco et al ., 1987) or triggered by computerized EEG seizure detection (Milton and Jung, 2002), could provide seizure relief in the future for patients who do not have identifiable epileptogenic regions that can be surgically resected. Despite tremendous advances in the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of presurgical evaluation, and improve- ments in the safety and efficacy of microsurgical approaches for the treatment of epilepsy, epilepsy sur- gery remains, arguably, the most underused acceptable treatment in the field of medicine. It has been estimated that there are 100,000 to 200,000 patients with intractable epilepsy in the United States who are potential candi- dates for epilepsy surgery; yet only 500 procedures were performed in this country in 1985, and 1500 in 1990 (Engel and Shewmon, 1993). More surgery is done today, but not much more. Similar statistics can be found in all countries of the industrialized world, and surgical treat- ment is still offered in only a few developing countries. When surgical treatment is performed, patients typically experience a delay of 20 to 22 years between the onset of epilepsy and referral to an epilepsy surgery program (Berg et al ., 2003; Benbadis et al ., 2003). In a recent review of patients undergoing surgical treatment for focal epilepsy, it took an average of 9 years to determine that seizures did not respond to two antiepileptic drugs (Berg et al ., 2003). Why surgery continues to be considered a last resort, or is not considered at all, even in patients with surgically remediable epilepsy syndromes is difficult to explain (Swarztrauber et al ., 2003). Patients and their physicians fear the possibility of surgical complications that could result in new neurological deficits or death; however, studies have documented that the morbidity and mortal- ity associated with recurrent seizures is considerably greater than that associated with surgical treatment (Sperling et al ., 1999). Cost may be a factor, but most insurance companies now reimburse for surgery, and the total cost for surgical treatment for epilepsy is much less than the cost to the patient and to society of a lifetime of disability. For years, absence of a randomized controlled trial of epilepsy surgery was a factor that led many physi- cians to continue to question the efficacy and lack of adverse consequences associated with removing parts of the brain as a treatment for epilepsy. Results of the recent randomized controlled trial of surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy should overcome this concern (Wiebe et al ., 2001). Finally, it is possible that the community of epileptologists involved in surgical treatment for epilepsy have not adequately educated their colleagues and the general public about the place of surgical intervention in the overall management of epileptic disorders, despite the extensive literature in recent years. Surgical intervention should play a greater role in the treatment of epilepsy than it does at present, particularly for surgically remediable epilepsy syndromes such as mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, as recommended in the AAN practice parameters (Engel et al ., 2003). Furthermore, if surgical treatment is to be effective, it should be performed early enough to avoid irreversible disabling consequences of recurrent seizures. Infants and small children with intractable epilepsy that causes devel- opmental delay end up in institutions. Recurrent dis- abling epileptic seizures during adolescence and early adulthood compromise acquisition of interpersonal and vocational skills. Too often, patients with uncontrolled seizures during adolescence and early adulthood who have surgery performed in their mid-twenties or later and become free of seizures are too socially and psychologi- The Emergence of Neurosurgical Approaches to the Treatment of Epilepsy 99 Ch05.qxd 9/1/04 6:33 AM Page 99"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"cally disabled to leave home, get a job, get married, raise a family, and pay taxes; they remain dependent on their families and on society. For many such patients, success- ful early surgical intervention might have rescued them from a lifetime of disability. Consequently, it is impor- tant to establish guidelines for deciding when to abandon additional trials of antiepileptic drugs and refer patients to an epilepsy surgery facility. One study has provided evidence that medical intractability can be predicted with a high degree of confidence after two appropriate trials of antiepileptic drugs have failed due to inefficacy, not intolerance (Kwan and Brodie, 2000). The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) supported multicenter Early R andomized Surgical Epilepsy Trial (ERSET) is currently attempting to compare surgical intervention with continued optimal medical treatment for patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy who have not had disabling seizures for more than 2 years and who have failed adequate trials of at least two antiepileptic drugs (Engel, 2003). Outcome measures include not only seizure control but also qual- ity of life, cognitive function, and activities of daily liv- ing. ERSET, which involves 19 epilepsy centers around the United States, is not about surgery per se, but about eliminating seizures without side effects as soon as possible, which should be the treatment goal of choice for epilepsy. Whether surgery or optimal trials of new antiepileptic drugs is more successful in achieving this goal is unknown, but whatever the outcome, ERSET could greatly influence physicians’ attitudes toward early aggressive treatment for epilepsy in the future. LESSONS FOR OTHER DISORDERS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM Epilepsy is an ancient affliction. By the beginning of modern neurology, it had already been recognized and described for almost 3000 years (Kinnier et al ., 1990) and attributed to disorders of the brain for almost 2500 years (Temkin, 1945). As the fields of neuroscience and neurology began to share concepts and inform each other, epilepsy had already been long established as a disorder worthy of investigations. Research on epilepsy further benefited from the relatively early realization that symptoms might be alleviated by resection of focal pathology, which provided surgeons with opportunities for examining the living human brain directly. Neuroscientists interested in normal brain function benefited as much from research involving patients with epilepsy, particularly in the operating room, as clinical neurologists and surgeons interested in understanding epilepsy benefited from the advances of neuroscience. Epileptologists were among the first to take advantage of each new clinical neuroinvestigative tool, whether it was EEG, neurocognitive evaluation, or neuroimaging, because surgical treatment of epilepsy required better understanding of the functional and anatomical sub- strates of localized brain activity. Perhaps for this reason, epilepsy surgeons have permitted neurophysiologists to carry out recording and stimulation experiments intraop- eratively and through chronically implanted intracranial electrodes, as well as to perform microdialysis studies, have given resected surgical specimens to neuropatholo- gists, neuroanatomists, neurochemists, molecular biolo- gists, and electrophysiologists for in vitro investigations, and allowed neuropsychologists to carry out detailed evaluations of their patients prior to and following local- ized brain excisions. Even disconnective surgery, such as corpus callosotomy, provided material of great interest to basic neuroscientists, contributing, for instance, to landmark research on hemispheric lateralization that helped earn Roger Sperry a Nobel Prize (Sperry, 1982). Research-oriented epilepsy surgery programs, such as those at the MNI, UCLA, the University of Bonn, and Yale, continue to exemplify the best tradition of multi- disciplinary biomedical science first manifest by the team of Jackson, Ferrier, and Horsley in 1886. Today, multi- disciplinary epilepsy surgery teams involve not only neu- rosurgeons, neurologists, and clinical neurophysiologists, but also neuropsychologists, neuroradiologists, nuclear medicine specialists, psychiatrists, and neuropathologists, along with a large number of diverse basic scientists who recognize the unique opportunity epilepsy surgery offers to investigate the fundamental neuronal mechanisms of both normal and abnormal functions of the human brain. Their objective is to eventually make it possible to cure epilepsy without surgery and to understand aspects of brain function well enough to realize currently unimaginable treatments for other neurological and mental illnesses. Advances in the field of neurosurgery for epilepsy, and its contributions to our knowledge of the brain, would not have occurred had it not been for the willingness of clinical and basic neuroscientists to collaborate, share their expertise and their data, and create a whole that in every way is greater than the sum of its parts. Throughout the history related here, multidisciplinary collaborative teams, beginning with Jackson, Ferrier, and Horsley, through the extensive epilepsy surgery programs of today, have been responsible for rapid progress in the field, whereas the applications of contributions by iso- lated investigators, like Berger, were inappropriately delayed. The building of multidisciplinary collaborative teams is not easy, and the continuing success of produc- tive epilepsy surgery programs is particularly remarkable at a time when academic institutions and funding 100 The Emergence of Neurosurgical Approaches to the Treatment of Epilepsy Ch05.qxd 9/1/04 6:33 AM Page 100"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"agencies do not always give appropriate credit to individ- uals who selflessly commit themselves to group efforts (Editorial, 2003). A few other neurological disorders may be amenable to similar surgical interventions, but the lessons of the successes experienced in the field of epilepsy surgery should not be applied superficially to concepts of identi- fying and excising an offending piece of brain. Rather, the lessons are more sociopolitical, emphasizing the importance of teamwork in identifying and effectively applying the seminal insights that move a field forward. The complexity of the tools available to us to investigate the nervous system for clinical and research purposes is increasing exponentially, and no single person could conceivably learn enough to take advantage of more than a small percentage of them. The future of biomed- ical science in general, and neurology specifically, lies with the ability of collaborative multidisciplinary teams to comprehensively exploit the highest technology for focused investigations of clinical relevance, which ultimately can be identified only by clinical neurologists. The clinical neurologist whose primary concern is the welfare of patients, therefore, remains an essential com- ponent of such a team, and traditional clinical neurology should never be overshadowed but, rather, continually enhanced by future technological advances in neuro- science investigation.

To meet these challenges, researchers have successfully applied the tools of neu- roimaging, neurogenetics, neuropharmacology, and neu- rophysiology. With recent advances, we now have a clearer description of cellular events that characterize the migraine visual aura and emerging knowledge about how these events promote the development of headache. We have achieved greater insights into drug-receptor interac- tions at the neuronal level, as well as insights into central mechanisms regulating pain and its response to treat- ment. Together with the discovery that mutated P/Q cal- cium channels underlie a rare migraine headache subtype, these important developments raise expectations that identifying genetic mutations and their neurobiological consequences may help to decipher molecular and cellu- lar mechanisms underlying more typical migraine types. Hence, this chapter highlights recent advances in the neu- robiology of migraine headache with the hope that a more coherent scientific basis will be achieved. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND NEUROIMAGING OF VISUAL AURA Migraine is an episodic often disabling disorder accompanied by headache and complex heterogeneous clinical features. The prodromal phase precedes headache by up to 24 hours and is experienced by approximately one third of migraineurs. Symptoms include disturbances in mood (e .g., euphoria, depression, irritation), alertness (e.g., hyperactivity, fatigue, drowsiness), and heightened perception of sound, light, or smell. Also, cravings for food or drink or yawning are more common (Headache Classification Committee, 1988). These symptoms may reflect activation of hypothalamus, limbic structures, frontal lobes, and/or locus ceruleus, but this assumption has not been validated by functional imaging as yet. The aura is typified by transient focal neurological dysfunction affecting half the visual field or body in about one fifth of migraineurs. It anticipates headache usually by 15 to 40 minutes, but may accompany headache onset and lasts 5 to 60 minutes. Aura symp- toms can vary widely from one attack to the next in the same patient and between migraineurs. Some auras are not accompanied by headache. Visual disturbances are the most common symptom, typically characterized by a serrated arc of shimmering, crenellated shapes. Scintillations usually appear as formless flashing lights, or sometimes as zig-zags (fortification spectra) that typi- cally propagate and expand from the paracentral region to the periphery in one visual field often followed by a scotoma. In other auras, sensory disturbances (typically tingling affecting distal parts of the extremities and peri- oral region that may slowly migrate to adjacent areas), motor symptoms, or dysphasia is less commonly experi- enced (Headache Classification Committee, 2004). It was assumed for some time that visual auras origi- nate from propagating events within somatotopic cortical regions (i.e., primary visual cortex). Recent magnetic reso- nance imaging (MRI) studies using high field strength near-continuous recordings have helped to validate this assumption and suggest a strong relationship between the visual aura and cortical spreading depression within the occipital lobe. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a transient phenomenon affecting one hemisphere (lissencephalic brain) or cerebral gyrus (gyrencephalic 107 CHAPTER 6 The Neurobiology of Migraine and Transformation of Headache Therapy Hayrunnisa Bolay, MD, PhD Michael A.

Calcium waves may also contribute to the propagation. In lissencephalic brain, hemodynamic events are quite prominent during early and late phases and include an initial hyperemia followed by long lasting oligemia in cortical gray matter coincident with spreading depolarization and prolonged hyperpolarization, respectively. The association of CSD and migraine visual aura was posited initially by Leao and also by Milner based on the slow propagation rate and reinforced by the calculated velocity of spreading oligemia in migraineurs using low resolution SPECT studies (Lauritzen and Olesen, 1984). More recently, migraine visual aura was explored using fMRI neuroimaging tools with high spatial and temporal resolution (Hadkikhani et al. , 2001; Cao et al. , 1999). This approach revealed multiple neurovascular events in the occipital cortex that resemble cortical spreading depression (Hadjikhani et al. , 2001). In sub- jects with exercise or light-induced visual auras, an initial increase in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal (possibly reflecting vasodilation) was followed by a decrease in the baseline signal (possibly reflecting vaso- constriction) propagating within primary visual cortex from posterior to anterior (i.e., from cortical representa- tion of paracentral to peripheral eccentricities) (Figure 6.1; see also the Color Plate section). The most likely source of the initial BOLD response was an increase in blood flow and volume caused by heightened neural activity reflected perceptually by the shining, scintillating migrating visual aura. The increase in BOLD signal was not confined to a single vascular territory. Hence, these studies suggested that visual auras were accompanied by focal occipital cortical blood flow changes propagating along primary visual cortex temporally and somatotopi- cally congruent with the visual percept (Figure 6.1; see also the Color Plate section). In human studies, the dura- tion of hyperemia, velocity of propagation, prolonged period of hy poperfusion, and transient suppression of responsiveness to visual activation (as reported in rabbit after CSD) are consistent with the known properties of CSD (Figure 6.2; see also the Color Plate section) (Hadjikhani et al. , 2001). Furthermore, the propagating BOLD signal change was restricted to gray matter and did not cross major sulci; it was also consistent with CSD in lower animals. To summarize, functional imaging stud- ies implicate CSD or a closely related neurophysiological event in the generation of the migraine visual aura. The relationship between CSD and migraine visual aura raises several interesting possibilities. For example, do CSDs underlie other types of migraine auras (e.g., somatosensory auras)? Might CSDs emanate from “silent” brain areas and cause migraine headache without an aura (Kunkler and Kraig, 2003), or could spreading events restricted to a few cortical laminae (instead of transcorti- cally) cause so-called silent or undetectable auras (by the patient) or underlie other migraine subtypes in which aura is not perceived to anticipate headache (e.g., migraine with- out aura)? If cortical spreading depression provides the neu- rophysiological substrate for headache, how does it relate to the genesis of pain (see later)? Finally, does the link between CSD and aura present new therapeutic targets and opportunities? The fact that CSD was found recently in traumatized human cortex (Strong et al. , 2002) and normal feline cortex by electrophysiological and MRI techniques reinforces the concept that the gyrencephalic mammalian cortex can generate a CSD-like event. HEADACHE Migraineurs usually experience unilateral, severe throbbing pain that is worsened by routine physical activ- ity. Headache is accompanied by increased sensitivity to light or sound that improves in a dark quiet room. Anorexia, nausea, rarely vomiting, and sensitivity to smell and sound are other symptoms associated with headache. Headache lasts 4 to 72 hours without treat- ment or insufficient therapy, and sleep resolves or dimin- ishes the severity of headache in many cases (Headache Classification Committee, 2004). Perception of headache requires activation of caudal trigeminal nuclei and sub- sequent transmission of pain impulses rostrally to thala- mus and associated cortical areas (e.g., somatosensory cortex). Insula, cingulate cortex, frontal cortex, and thal- amus are among the structures that have been implicated in pain processing during headache (Bolay and Moskowitz, 2002). Moreover, the red nucleus and sub- stantia nigra are reportedly activated during the early phases of headache (Welch et al. , 1998; Cao et al. , 2002). Functional imaging studies have implicated other brain regions (dorsal raphe nucleus and locus ceruleus) in migraine pathophysiology hours after headache onset (Weiller et al. , 1995). However, once the headache phase begins, it becomes difficult to decipher temporal sequences or the ways in which brainstem nuclei participate in the genesis or processing of pain or in migraine-associated symptoms. Hence, the importance of these specific nuclei and their activation remain for further study. Trigeminal Innervation of Pain-Sensitive Intracranial Structures Symptoms of migraine headache just summarized are triggered after activation of the trigeminovascular system (Mosko witz and Macfarlane, 1993; Moskowitz, 1984, 1991). Ch06.qxd 9/2/04 11:02 AM Page 108"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"The trigeminal nerve transmits nociceptive information from cephalic structures via small caliber C fibers containing neu- ropeptides. Peripheral afferent fibers innervate the adventitia and perivascular space and are found densely in major ves- sels of dura mater and leptomeninges (pia mater and arachnoid) that cover the brain parenchyma, particularly over the basal surface (Mayberg et al. , 1981; Liu-Chen et al. , 1983; Suzuki et al. , 1989). Trigeminal nerve fibers are strategically situated at the interface between blood and cerebrospinal fluid or brain parenchyma, possibly to detect the presence of any noxious substances originating from these sources. Sensitization or activation of trigeminovascular afferents releases vasoactive neuropeptides (calcitonin gene- related peptide [CGRP] substance P [SP] and neurokinin A [NKA]) that mediate vasodilation and edema. The trigeminal innervation appears remarkably similar in species such as the rat, cat, and human, despite differ- ences in brain size and organizational complexity (Mayberg et al. , 1981; Suzuki et al. , 1989; Feindel et al. , 1960). Axons project to pain sensitive (meningeal blood vessels) but not insensate (brain parenchyma) structures, although trigeminal fibers are often found within the cra- nium in areas considered insensate (e.g., unassociated with vessels or surrounding smaller blood vessels). It seems reasonable to assume that the meninges contain silent nociceptors that discharge upon sensitization dur- ing inflammatory conditions. The dura mater and its large vessels (middle meningeal artery, MMA) are one of the most pain-sensitive intracra- nial structures (Penfield and McNaughton, 1940; Ray and Wolff, 1940).

Wolff and colleagues performed a series of experiments on humans and demonstrated that electrical or mechan- ical stimulation of large vessels in the dura and pia mater generates throbbing unilateral migraine-like pain (Ray and Wolff, 1940). Some trigeminal neurons in rodents project bifurcating axons to innervate both the middle cerebral (pial) and middle meningeal (dural) arteries (Mayberg et al. , 1981). The existence of axonal bifurca- tions predicts that discharge of perivascular afferents, sur- rounding pial-arachnoid arteries, may modulate the diameter and permeability of overlying vessels within dura mater (Bolay et al. , 2002; Iedecola, 2002) (Figure 6.3). Activation of the trigeminovascular system is posited to coincide with development of headache. Among oth- ers, CGRP is the prominent neuropeptide that is released from activated trigeminovascular afferents as evidenced by the finding that plasma CGRP levels become increased during migraine headache and decreased after aborting the attack (Goadsby et al. , 1990). The release of neuropeptides promoting neurogenic vasodilation and plasma protein extravasation within ipsilateral dura mater might further induce perivascular nociceptive afferents to facilitate headache. Supporting the latter notion, CGRP infusion can induce a migraine headache in humans (Lassen et al. , 2002). Because of the release of neuropeptides exerting their effect on postjunctional vas- cular wall and development of primary afferent sensiti- zation (see later), the vascular pulsations and venous pressure changes are perceived as noxious (Longmore et al. , 1997) and cause axonal discharge during pulsa- tions in ways that remain obscure. Nevertheless, these features can enlighten the characteristic pulsating nature of migraine headache that is worsened by daily activities such as coughing, bending, or climbing stairs, which nor- mally lead to innocuous changes in intracranial pressure. 110 The Neurobiology of Migraine and Transformation of Headache Therapy FIGURE 6.2 Progression of scintillations in the dark without visual stimuli during visual aura.

Intense neurometabolic cortical activity such as CSD (illustrated by DC shift in cortex) releases potas- sium (K + ) and hydrogen (H + ) ions, neurotransmitters, and metabolites such as nitric oxide (NO) adenosine, and arachidonate (AA) into the extracellular and perivascular space. Within the perivascular space, these molecules activate/sensitize perivascular trigeminal afferents and transmit impulses centrally to trigeminal ganglia and second-order neu- rons in nucleus caudalis (TGN). Activation of trigeminal axonal collat- erals innervating dura mater release vasoactive neuropeptides (substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, neurokinin A) mediating perivascular neurogenic plasma protein extravasation. CSD-induced TGN activation causes long-lasting vasodilation and blood flow increase in dura mater through a pathway originating from superior sali- vatory nucleus and reaching meningeal blood vessels via sphenopalatine ganglia. Postganglionic parasympathetic agents promote vasodilation and augmented flow by releasing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, nitric oxide, and acetylcholine into the dura mater. As evidence for a central trigeminal- parasympathetic “reflex,” lesioning trigeminal nerve significantly sup- pressed prolonged blood flow elevation in the middle meningeal artery (MMA) (P2), edema, and c-fos expression after CSD. The MMA response was dependent upon trigeminal brainstem inputs based on results after trigeminal rhizotomy. The perception of pain is mediated by r ostral pro- jections from TGN. The data are consistent with the formulation that events within the brain stimulate trigeminovascular afferents to gener- ate headache and promote MMA vasodilation in an animal model of aura-induced migraine (Iedecola, 2002). Ch06.qxd 9/2/04 11:02 AM Page 110"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Molecular Dissection of the Trigeminovascular System Trigeminal afferents surround the wall of meningeal vessels and express several unique receptors such as 5-HT 1B/D/F subtypes (Longmore et al. , 1997). In other respects they are presumed to show characteristics of other small unmyelinated nociceptive C fibers. They would therefore possess numerous prejunctional endings containing various receptors such as prostaglandin receptors (EP1), vanilloid receptors (VR1), nerve growth factor receptors (tr κ A), adenosine receptors (A1), pro- teinase activated receptor (PAR2), purinergic receptors (P2X3), or specific ion channels differentially expressed in nociceptive pathways such as sensory neuron specific Na + channels (SNS or NaN) or the K + channel (Kv1.4) (Waxman et al. , 1999; Gold et al. , 1996; Woolf and Salter, 2000; Stock et al. , 2000) (Figure 6.4). This assumption is not unreasonable because topically applied potassium, protons, and prostaglandins sensitize and dis- charge unmyelinated C fibers in dura mater as they do other primary afferent axons (Strassman et al. , 1996; Burstein et al. , 1998). On binding of molecules such as acetylcholine, prostaglandin, bradykinin, protons, gluta- mate, adenosine, or nerve growth factor, those receptors either activate nociceptive terminals and initiate an action potential, or reduce the amount of depolarization required for activation (sensitization) (Woolf and Salter, 2000). Sensitization of nociceptors could also be medi- ated by repeated exposure to weaker stimuli. Based on their sensitivity to capsaicin, trigeminovascular axons probably express vanilloid receptors. Vanilloid receptors are nonselective cation channels residing on small C fibers that can be sensitized by repeated heat, capsaicin, bradykinin, or proton exposure (Figure 6.4) (Bolay and Moskowitz, 2002; Woolf and Salter, 2000). Activation/sensitization is mediated through either increases in intracellular calcium levels or activation of intracellular kinases (e.g., protein kinase C, protein kinase A, or tyrosine kinases), some of which may phos- phorylate sensory neuron-specific channels and VR1 receptors. Post receptor events appear critical because protons and prostaglandin (PG) E 2 sensitize peripheral afferents by phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms. Phosphorylation of sensory neuron-specific channels could lower the activation threshold and rate of inactiva- tion and increase the magnitude of sodium current. The agonistic activity of ligands such as bradykinin can be potentiated by PKC-dependent vanilloid receptor phos- phorylation (Bolay and Moskowitz, 2002).

On binding of molecules such as prostaglandin, bradykinin, heat, protons, glu- tamate, adenosine, nerve growth factor, purines, or plasminogen those receptors either initiate an action potential (AP) or sensitize the nociceptive prejunctional terminal. Intracellular Ca ++ increase, activation of intra- cellular kinases (protein kinase C [PKC], tyrosine kinases [TryK]), and phosphorylation play a major role in the sensitization/activation process. Activated prejunctional trigeminal afferents mediate vesicular release of vasoac- tive neuropeptides (Np) such as calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P, and neurokinin A acting on their cor- responding receptors (NpR) on the vessel wall and leading to neurogenic vasodilation and blood flow increase and edema. Antimigraine efficacy of triptans and ergots may be mediated via serotonin 5-HT 1D/F receptors on pre- junctional side and central endings within trigeminal nucleus caudalis, as well as 5-HT 1B subtype on cerebral vasculature. Ch06.qxd 9/2/04 11:02 AM Page 111"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Serotonin 5-HT 1 receptors have a major impact on migraine pathophysiology and are expressed on both pri- mary afferent terminals and vascular smooth muscle pro- moting vasoconstriction (Johnson et al. , 1998). 5-HT 1B, D and 5-HT 1F receptors are expressed on trigeminal neu- rons, whereas 5-HT 1B is predominant within the cranial vasculature. Agonist activation of 5-HT 1D receptors inhi bits trigeminal discharges and may be responsible for antimigraine efficacy of triptans and dihydroergotamine (Moskowitz, 1992; Buzzi and Moskowitz, 1991). Of course, 5-HT 1B/D/F receptors are expressed on prejunctional nerve endings within trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC), where they may inhibit transmitter release. Their presence on postsynaptic neurons within TNC seems doubtful. SENSITIZATION AND MIGRAINE Sensitization has been documented in experimental headache models and in migraineurs. In headache mod- els, sensitization develops in meningeal nociceptors and central trigeminal neurons after chemical irritation or electrical stimulation of dura mater. The chemical sub- stances such as K + ,H + , and inflammatory substances (e.g., prostaglandins) applied to dura mater activate trigeminovascular afferents and sensitize them to mechanical stimuli (Strassman et al. , 1996; Burstein et al. , 1998). Dural inputs and cutaneous trigeminal axons converge on single central trigeminal neurons within brainstem. After stimulation of dura mater with proin- flammatory substances, those TNC neurons respond to subsequent “subthreshold” mechanical or thermal stim- ulation of periorbital skin. Cutaneous allodynia has also been described in patients during migraine headache. Allodynia, a sensation of pain evoked by a non-noxious stimulus, has been detected in 79% of migraneurs in the ipsilateral head or extending beyond the referred pain area (Burstein et al. , 2000). Allodynia is transient, occur- ring during the migraine attack. The phenomenon is lim- ited to the painful area in the ipsilateral head, reflecting a transient increase in the sensitivity of peripheral (first order) and central (second order) trigeminal neurons that receive convergent input from intracranial structures, such as blood vessels, meninges, and extracranial struc- tures, such as skin and hair follicles. Allodynia can affect areas outside the trigeminal system. The latter may indi- cate the developm ent of sensitization of at least third- order neurons (i.e., thalamic neurons) that receive convergent input from distant body sites, as well as from the dura and periorbital skin (Figure 6.5) (Burstein et al. , 2000). Augmentation of the nociceptive blink reflex response may also reflect sensitization of brainstem trigem- inal neurons during migraine headache (Kaube et al. , 2002). Development of central sensitization depends on the impulses coming from trigeminal nociceptors and indicates the importance of early treatment of migraine headaches. As a potential trigger for headache, cortical spreading depression causes release of ions and neurotransmitters from neurons and glia (e.g., potassium ions, protons, arachidonic acid, nitric oxide, and adenosine) and is hypothesized to depolarize trigeminal axons and dilate meningeal blood vessels (Bolay et al. , 2002; Iedecola, 2002; Lauritzen et al. , 1990; Kraig and Nicholson, 1978; Read et al. , 1997). Although the route taken by these ions and molecules to access the pial surface is not known exactly, gap junctional communications between astro- cyte-pia-arachnoidal cells and the meningial glial net- work (Grafstein et al. , 2000) play a role in transmitting intraparenchymal signals to meningeal perivascular trigeminal axons (Figure 6.3). Venous channels from the cerebral cortex (draining into the dural sinuses) may con- tribute. Recently, matrix metallaproteases (MMPs) have been implicated. Within 15 minutes after CSD, MMP activity increases and changes in vascular permeability documented using Evans blue extravasation. Changes in vascular permeability are abrogated after MMP-9 inhibi- tion and do not develop in mice lacking MMP-9 gene expression (Gursoy-Ozdemir et al ., 2004). The potential role for nitric oxide (NO) as a mediator of first-and/or second-order trigeminal neuronal sen- sitization has been proposed (Jones et al. , 2001). Neurogenic inflammation mediated by vasoactive pep- tides such as CGRP and SP may also promote sensitiza- tion and a lowered threshold for depolarization (Moskowitz and Macfarlane, 1993; Moskowitz, 1992; Markowitz et al. , 1987). Proinflammatory molecules such as PGE 2 , serotonin, bradykinin, epinephrine, adenosine, or nerve growth factor are also potential mediators, as is mast cell degranulation, and possibly macrophage activation. TRIGGERING/ANTICIPATING EVENTS (INTRINSIC BRAIN DERIVED AND EXTRINSIC) Triggering mechanisms and cascades of events leading to the development of headache are poorly understood. Genetic susceptibility is important, but genetic factors alone cannot explain the significant variability from one exposure to the next in the same patient. On exposure to a trigger, acute migraine headache usually develops within 24 hours. Common triggers include altered brain activity such as stress, emotional upset or sleep changes, aura, circulating chemicals (nitroglycerin, monosodium glutamate, aspartame), food (alcoholic or caffeinated beverages, cheese, chocolate), environmental factors (whether changes, bright lights, odors), allergens, and hormones. 112 The Neurobiology of Migraine and Transformation of Headache Therapy Ch06.qxd 9/2/04 11:02 AM Page 112"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"The Neurobiology of Migraine and Transformation of Headache Therapy 113 FIGURE 6.5 Cutaneous allodynia during migraine attacks.

It was shown that CSD is a sufficient stimulus to trigger trigeminovascular activation (Bolay et al. , 2002). Using a novel technique called laser speckle imaging (Dunn et al. , 2001), it was demonstrated that CSD triggered long-lasting neurogenic blood flow responses and plasma protein leakage in dura mater. CSD caused a slow and sustained (45 minutes) MMA blood flow increase and vasodilation (Figure 6.6; see also Color Plate section) that was mediated by trigeminal- parasympathetic reflex activation (Bolay et al. , 2002). Transection of the trigeminal nerve (nasociliary nerve), trigeminal root, or postganglionic parasympathetic affer- ent fibers abolished the sustained blood flow increase in the MMA, indicating that this vascular response was neurogenically mediated and required central brainstem transmission. CSD also caused protein leakage and edema in the meninges, and this response was blocked by selective trigeminal nerve transection. Besides meningeal changes, CSD also activated ipsilateral trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) neurons as reflected by expres- sion of early immediate response gene, c-fos within TNC (Bolay et al. , 2002; Moskowitz et al. , 1993). Trigeminal nerve transection or sumatriptan pretreatment abrogated the c-fos response (Bolay et al. , 2002; Moskowitz et al. , 1993). These findings collectively demonstrate that intense neurometabolic activity within the cerebral cortex can evoke meningeal and brainstem trigeminal activation to promote vasodilation and events consistent with the development of head pain. Chemical Triggers The role of nitroglycerin as a trigger depends on sev- eral observations that implicate a role for NO in migraine pathogenesis (Olesen et al. , 1993; Lassen et al. , 1997). Nitroglycerin, an NO donor, has been known to induce severe headaches for many years, and early reports came from patients working in factories to make explosives. Administration of nitroglycerin induces immediate tran- sient headache in individuals; however, typical migraine headaches develop only in migraineurs and only hours later (Olesen et al. , 1993). Migraine headache starting after a long delay (4 to 6 hours) was observed after nitro- glycerin administration, far exceeding the half-life of the infused drug. Recent studies investigating the molecular mecha- nisms of nitroglycerin-induced headache shed light on our understanding of this relationship (Reuter et al. , 2002; Lambert et al. , 2000). Nitroglycerin administration promoted a cascade of inflammatory signaling events exclusively within the dura mater (and not in the cerebral cortex); interleukin (IL)-1 β IL-6 production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induction were measured in dura mater, with a time course consistent with nitroglycerin-induced migraine in humans. The nitroglycerin effects were dose-dependent, and the threshold dose in the experimental animal was similar to that in the human (Reuter et al. , 2001). The inflamma- tory responses were delayed and distributed most promi- nently within resident macrophages around large dural vessels. The time for gene up regulation could explain the delayed headache after nitroglycerin administration in susceptible individuals (Figure 6.7). NF κ B, a transcriptional factor, mediates nitroglyc- erin-induced inflammation. Its activation and nuclear translocation was shown one hour after nitroglycerin infusion, and one hour before iNOS gene and protein expression (Reuter et al. , 2002). Parthenolide, the active ingredient in Feverfew (an old herbal migraine remedy), blocks iNOS expression plus NF κ B translocation, indi- cating the potential therapeutic importance of this transcription factor in migraine headache (Figure 6.7). The nitroglycerin experiments reinforce the impor- tance of inflammation and NO to trigeminal activation and migraine. It is well known that NO exerts its main physiological effects via formation of a second messen- ger, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) as a con- sequence of activating soluble guanylate cyclase. In fact, sildenafil (Viagra), an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phos- phodiesterase-5 (breakdown cGMP), caused typical migraine attack (with nausea, photophobia, phonopho- bia) in 11 of 12 patients (Kruuse et al. , 2003). GENETIC MODULATORS Migraine has a complex and heterogeneous pheno- type, as well as multifactorial genetics, and exogenous triggers are known to play an important role as well. Recent identification of mutations in specific genes linked to rare types of migraine contributes significantly to our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, although the emerging picture appears quite complex and is far from complete. Twin studies show a high concordance rate and there is a sixfold increased risk in first-degree relatives of probands in most common migraine types. So far, a sim- ple mendelian inheritance pattern for common types has not been identified. As noted previously, less common variants have pro- vided more fruitful pathophysiological clues.

A slower and more sustained increase in MMA blood flow (P2) is observed for approximately 45 minutes. These images clearly demonstrate that CSD-induced trigeminal activation causes long-lasting vasodi- lation selectively in dura mater; oligemia was prominent in cerebral cortex (Bolay et al. , 2002).

Recently, a polymorphism in the Na + ,K + -ATPase gene was also reported in other pedigrees (type 2) (De Fusco et al. , 2003). Because the P/Q type Ca ++ channel is expressed primarily in neurons (predominantly glutamatergic neu- rons), whereas the affected Na + ,K + -ATPase 2 is mainly expressed on astrocytes, factors contributing to the clini- cal phenotype are rather complex and implicate both neurons and glia, and perhaps even reinforce the impor- tance of an event such as cortical spreading depression. Glutamate cycling has recently been implicated. Efficient Ca ++ -dependent vesicular release of glutamate depends on the preferential location of Cav2.1 channels adjacent to SNARE proteins at presynaptic terminals (Qian and Noebels, 2001). Postsynaptic Cav2.1 channels on dendrites and cell soma appear critical for neuronal excitability and Ca ++ -dependent intracellular events such as gene expression. Mutations at one or both sites may be important. In FHMI, mutations in CACNA1A are heterogeneous and at least 14 different missense muta- tions have been identified. The functional importance of Cav2.1 mutations and consequent loss or gain of func- tion have been established only for some point muta- tions. Recent data overexpressing the human mutant Cav2.1 α 1 subunit in cells null for the CACNA1A gene revealed an increased channel opening probability over a wide range of voltages, and activation of the mutant channel that was insufficient to open wild-type channels in response to s mall depolarizations (Tottene et al. , 2002). FHM mutations in cerebellar granular cells caused an increase of single channel Ca ++ influx during more hyper- polarized voltages, and decreased density of functional channels along with maximal Cav2.1 current. Such gain of function mutations at presynaptic terminals might lead to increased Ca ++ influx through channels strategically located at the vesicular release site. Enhanced glutamate release could account for increased cortical excitability of migraineurs and possibly susceptibility to spreading depression (Figure 6.8) (Moskowitz et al. , 2004). Leaner mice expressing naturally occurring missense mutation in the Cav2.1 channel gene show an altered CSD phenotype. The mutated channel in the leaner mice showed a reduced open probability, and activation was shifted to more depolarized voltages (Dove et al. , 1998). From the biophysical characteristics of the expressed mutant channel (i.e., loss of function of Cav2.1), tottering 116 The Neurobiology of Migraine and Transformation of Headache Therapy P P p65 IkB IKK Parthenolide Parthenolide Aspirin Inflammation and Pain NO IL-1 Ox.

Under resting condi- tions, the transcription factor nuclear factor- κ B (NF- κ b) resides in the cytoplasm of quiescent dural macrophages as a p50-p65 dimer inactivated by inhibitory proteins-kb (I κ b). Noxious stimuli, such as proinflammatory cytokines, oxygen radicals, or NO (e.g., after GTN infusion an NO donor) indirectly activate I κ b kinase complex (IKK) to phoshorylate I κ b proteins. Once phoshorylated I κ b family members dissociate from NF- κ b (p65-p50) and translocate to the nucleus, binding specific recognition elements in the promoter regions of inflammatory and stress-related genes, thereby activating transcription. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin (IL)-1 β , and IL-6 contribute to proinflammatory signaling that ultimately leads to increased blood vessel permeability, tis- sue edema, and pain sensitization, providing in part the molecular and functional mechanisms related to migraine pain in dura mater. Molecules such as aspirin or parthenolide inhibit the NF- κ b-dependent transcriptional acti- vation at multiple sites to prevent meningeal inflammation and migraine headache (Reuter et al. , 2002).

This study also showed an impairment of glutamate release. In this mutation, it remains unclear as to whether the behavior of the channel under physiological conditions is different from that measured in response to prolonged cortical depolarization evoked either by K + application or faradic stimuli. Nevertheless, the paroxysmal nature of migraine attacks followed by normal neurological func- tion interictally is consistent with neurological distur- bances in which one or more ion channels or ion pumps have been implicated. The FHM2 mutation occurs in the Na + ,K + -ATPase α 2 subunit and suggests the importance of maintaining and preserving ionic gradients by glia. Astrocytes restore extracellular glutamate and K + to normal levels during neuronal depolarization. The mutated protein in FHM2 may cause pump failure and enhance excitability and also enhances levels of intracellular calcium as a result of the close association of Na + ,K + -ATPase with the Na + /Ca ++ exchanger. Astrocytic Na + ,K + -ATPase also plays a critical role in driving glycolysis and coupling neuronal activity to metab- olism (Figure 6.8) (Magistretti and Pellerin, 1999). Reuptake of glutamate from the synaptic cleft occurs pri- marily by astrocytes via glutamate transporters (GLAST and GLT-1) depending on electrochemical Na + gradients. Co-transport of 2-3 Na + ions along with one glutamate into astrocytes drives Na + ,K + -ATPase by increasing intracellular Na + concentration. Activity of Na + ,K + - ATPase is linked to glucose uptake, glycolysis, and The Neurobiology of Migraine and Transformation of Headache Therapy 117 FHM1, CACNA1A Mutation Increased Ca++ influx Increased glutamate release Increased excitability ?

(5) Synaptic glutamate-induced anaerobic glycolysis results in lactate production in astrocytes, lactate is preferred by neurons as metabolic substrate after intense activity, though direct glucose uptake occurs under basal conditions. Lactate is aerobically metabolized via pyruvate within neurons. Results of missense mutations in CACNA1A gene coding Cav2.1 (gain of function) and ATP1A2 gene coding astrocytic Na + ,K + -ATPase (loss of function) underlying FHM1 and FHM2 phenotype, respectively, are shown.

Hydro lysis of 2 ATP molecules produced by glycolysis drives Na + ,K + - ATPase pump that removes 6 intra-astrocytic Na + ions in exchange for 4 extracellular K + ions. Lactate released from astrocytes has been convincingly shown to provide the main energy substrate for synaptic activity (in the absence of glucose), but even preferred by the neuron, particularly during intense activity or stressful conditions such as ischemia or hypoxia (Schurr et al. , 1997). We propose that any disturbance of such a critically positioned Na + ,K + - ATPase would lead to slow clearance of glutamate and K + from the synaptic cleft, glutamate spillover, and inad- equate glycolysis and lactate production required for recovery of neuronal function. The latter aspect may explain long-lasting disturbances of synaptic activity (as evidenced by evoked potential studies) and uncoupling after CSD. Those notions may also account for pro- longed neurological dysfunction during aura in patients with FHM and generation of migraine pain, although the exact mechanism is still unclear. CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) is an inherited migraine variant wherein 30% of patients expe- rience migraine with aura. Recurrent subcortical strokes, dementia, and depression are other symptoms and MRIs show hyperintense symmetrical lesions in subcortical white matter affecting basal ganglia. The arteriopathy within small cerebral arteries is not related to atheroscle- rosis or amyloidosis. Notch 3, a member of a notch fam- ily involved in cell fate with epidermal growth factor-like domain, is encoded by a defective gene. The link between cell survival genes, arteriopathy, and migraine aura in these families is unknown but could relate to a damage- induced response. Considering that migraineurs often exhibit white matter abnormalities on brain imaging stud- ies, however, it is intriguing to search for a specific mech- anism by which this vascular disorder can initiate aura symptoms. It is not unreasonable to speculate that neurons and glia as well as blood vessels (and blood components) can trigger CSD and migraine under the appropriate conditions in susceptible individuals. The first attempts to tie FHM or CADASIL muta- tions with more common migraine types failed to reveal a striking relationship; however, other genes have been implicated. Dopamine receptors, serotonin receptors, serotonin transporters, chloride channels, angiotension- converting enzyme, nitric oxide synthase, and phospho- lipase A2 were investigated. Linkage studies excluded the possible involvement of serotonin receptors such as 5-HT 1B , 5-HT 1D , 5-HT 2 α , and 5-HT transporter in migraineurs with or without aura. Nevertheless, results of association studies are difficult to interpret, and sam- pling high numbers of patients is needed to draw definite conclusions. The insulin receptor gene that is located within the same region with CACNA1A is asso- ciated with migraine aura, although no functional abnormality was detected in this mutated protein in preliminary studies. SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR TREATMENT WITH TRIPTANS Serotonin and 5-HT 1B/D Receptors and the Development of Specific Agonists The concept behind today’s migraine treatment began to develop three decades ago with early, albeit imperfect and often contradictory, observations on the importance of serotonin in migraine pathogenesis. For example, it was shown that platelet serotonin decreased rapidly dur- ing migraine headaches, whereas urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, a main serotonin metabolite, was increased (Curran et al. , 1965). Furthermore, migraineurs developed headache after reserpine or fen- fluramine treatment, drugs that release serotonin from neurons and platelets. Supporting a role of serotonin receptors in migraine, parenteral serotonin administra- tion aborted headache in some patients. Because 5-HT reportedly drops during migraine attacks and 5-HT infu- sion alleviates migraine headaches, Humphrey and colleagues suggested that targeting selective serotonin receptor subtypes might abort migraine headache. Despite the unequivocal and dramatic success of target- ing serotonin receptors in migraine, we still have only limited information about the role of serotonin in migraine pathogenesis. Classification of serotonin receptors has received con- siderable attention. On the basis of ligand binding stud- ies and molecular cloning techniques, 5-HT receptors are divided into seven major subgroups (Hoyer et al. , 1994). Most are G protein-coupled receptors. Members of the 5-HT 1 family of inhibitory G protein-linked receptors appearing most relevant to migraine are composed of five subgroups, A through F. 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B recep- tors and their mRNAs are expressed within human trigeminal ganglia, as are 5-HT 1F receptors, specifying their prejunctional location. However, immunoreactive 5-HT 1D is present on trigeminal axonal endings, whereas 5-HT 1B immunoreactivity is restricted to cranial blood vessels (Longmore et al. , 1997). Ergot alkaloids and trip- tans have high affinities for both 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 1B receptors. Drug binding to 5-HT 1B/D receptors block peripheral (and probably central) trigeminal neurotrans- mitter release and also enhance closure of putative cra- nial arteriovenous anastomoses (Buzzi and Moskowitz, 1991; Buzzi et al. , 1992). Hence, triptans possess sero- 118 The Neurobiology of Migraine and Transformation of Headache Therapy Ch06.qxd 9/2/04 11:02 AM Page 118"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"tonin 5-HT 1B/D agonist activity that mediates their primary therapeutic effect; they also activate 5-HT 1A or 5-HT 1F receptors to a lesser extent. However these drugs are not specific to 5-HT 1D and also activate 5-HT 1B receptors that mediate vasoconstriction (Johnson et al. , 1998). The extent to which triptans require brain pene- tration to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy is currently debated. Also debated is whether the blood-brain barrier remains intact during a migraine attack. 5-HT 1F is another member of the serotonin receptor- 1 subtype family that is implicated in migraine. 5-HT 1F receptors are distributed within trigeminal nucleus cau- dalis and substantia gelatinosa with a greater density than 5-HT 1D receptors. Selective 5-HT 1F receptor ago- nists inhibit dural plasma protein extravasation and block expression of the early immediate response gene, c-fos, within TNC after intracisternal capsaicin; 5-HT 1F agonists do not constrict blood vessels, supporting the notion that migraine efficacy does not necessarily require vasoconstriction (Shepheard et al. , 1999). 5- HT 1F can abort headaches in migraineurs, as demon- strated in a clinical study. Therefore the 5-HT 1F receptor may be another promising therapeutic target. However, 5-HT 1F may not be essential for triptan activity, as almi- tidan, a new triptan with negligible 5-HT 1F ligand bind- ing activity, is more potent than sumatriptan in blocking neurogenic protein extravasation and is effec- tive clinically. Effectiveness of Triptans in Experimental Migraine Models The most effective mechanism in pain relief in migraine appears to be the ability to inhibit neuronal firing in TNC and consequently neurogenic edema and dilation of meningeal vessels. Several animal models such as trigeminal ganglionic stimulation, sagittal sinus stimulation, intracisternal capsaicin administration, and cortical spreading depression have been used to investigate migraine pathophysiology and the efficacy of treatment (Markowitz et al. , 1987; Buzzi and Moskowitz, 1991; Bolay et al. , 2002). Electrical stimu- lation of the trigeminal ganglion results in neurogenic plasma protein extravasation in dura mater that can be effectively blocked by 5-HT 1B/1D receptor agonist’s trip- tans, as well as ergot alkaloids but not by simple vaso- constrictor agents (Ray and Wolff, 1940; Buzzi and Moskowitz, 1991; Buzzi et al. , 1992). Plasma extrava- sation was reported to be accompanied by mast cell degranulation and platelet aggregation in dura mater (Buzzi et al. , 1992). Neuropeptide release (such as CGRP and substance P) following trigeminal afferent stimulation also leads to vasodilation of the middle meningeal artery and its branches in dura mater that can be used as a model for drug screening. Effective antimigraine compounds abort the vasodilation in response to electrical or chemical stimulation of dural afferents. CGRP infusion itself is enough to induce vasodilation and increase firing of second-order neu- rons in TNC, indicating the importance of this neu- ropeptide for both vasodilation in meninges and activation of the trigeminovascular system. Activation of TNC neurons in response to nocicep- tive stimuli was also investigated by examining expres- sion of the immediate early gene c-fos. Stimulation of sagittal sinus, dural vessels, or MMA activates trigem- inal complex induced c-fos expression that was also suppressed by 5-HT 1B/1D receptor agonists. Cortical spreading depression has been shown to induce neuro- genic plasma extravasation, vasodilation in dura mater, and activation of brainstem nociceptive neurons (Bolay et al. , 2002; Moskowitz et al. , 1993). CSD- induced neurogenic edema in rat was partially sup- pressed by an NK1 receptor antagonist implicating the role of substance P release. Sumatriptan in a dosage comparable to that used in humans was able to block c-fos induction. Neurogenic inflammation has been postulated as a mechanism relevant to vascular headache pathogenesis and treatment in addition to central processing within the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Moskowitz, 1992). Its inhibition alone, if not accompanied by an inhibitory effect on second-order trigeminal neurons, does not seem to be predictive for clinical efficacy against central sensi- tization and cutaneous allodynia. Antagonists of endothelin receptor A/B and NK-1 receptors failed in clinical trials despite their potent inhibitory effect on neurogenic edema. In summary, 5-HT 1B/1D/1F receptors effectively inhibit neurogenic plasma extravasation and vasodilation in dura mater and inhibit neuropeptide release from acti- vated trigeminovascular nerve endings in animal models. These drugs block transmitter release from central end- ings of primary afferents and therefore inhibit transmis- sion of nociceptive impulses to second-order neurons within trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Levi et al. , 2004). Triptans are the first antimigraine drugs developed specifically to activate 5-HT 1 receptors and are a mile- stone in migraine treatment. However, failure of those agents to abort migraine in one fifth of patients, headache recurrences, and common side effects (such as chest tightness, dizziness) have led researchers to look for more potent and better tolerated new thera- peutic strategies. Considering that the action of other abortive and prophylactic medications for migraine are nonspecific and unsatisfactory in many patients, the necessity for developing new treatment strategies seems imperative.

Although synaptic release by prejunctional receptor occupa- tion is the preferred method for new migraine drugs, drugs that block postjunctional receptors have a role as well. CGRP is the most potent vasodilator neuropeptide in the cerebral circulation. Vasodilator effects of CGRP are not dependent on endothelium and can be inhibited by a peptide antagonist, CGRP (8-37). CGRP antago- nists also inhibit the increase in dural blood flow evoked by electrical stimulation of meninges. In addition to vasodilation and blood flow increase, some recent data suggest a role for CGRP in neurogenic edema as well. Those preclinical data promoted the development of CGRP antagonists for clinical trials with expectation of blocking cerebrovascular postjunctional CGRP recep- tors. The initial pharmacological properties of such compounds showed their high selectivity for human CGRP receptors. The first clinical investigation of an injected CGRP antagonist BIBN4096BS for acute migraine showed a favorable 66% response rate without cardiovascular side effects (Olesen et al ., 2004). Adenosine Receptors There is evolving evidence suggesting that adenosine A1 receptors may be a target. The selective adenosine A1 receptor agonist, GR79236, inhibits neuronal activity within the trigeminocervical complex and reduces the increased CGRP level in response to superior sagittal sinus stimulation (Goadsby et al. , 2002). The inhibitory effect of GR79236 on neurogenic dural vasodilation, but not by intravenous CGRP administration, suggests that the effect of GR79236 is mediated via the activation of prejunctional adenosine A1 receptors. Antiepileptics (Valproate, Gabapentin, Lamotrigine) In recent years, antiepileptic agents have been among the most promising drugs for the prevention of migraine because of their action on enhancing γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition and interaction with voltage gated Na + channels, although the exact mechanism is not understood. There is evidence that valproate aborts neurogenic dural extravasation and inhibits the central transmission within the trigeminal nucleus caudalis through GABA-A receptors. Sodium valproate is the only antiepileptic drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for migraine prevention. Newer antiepilep- tics, including gabapentin, topiramate, and lamotrigine, are being evaluated. Lamotrigine might be useful for migraine aura by decreasing glutamate release. Botulinum Toxin Botulinum toxin blocks vesicular release of neuropep- tides by interfering with vesicular- and membrane-bound synaptic proteins. Botulinum toxin reduces substance P release from dorsal horn neurons. Antinociceptive effects of botulinum toxin A have been demonstrated in a formalin model; Botox A inhibited peripheral sensitization by block- ing neurotransmitter release. It was postulated that Botox A would be useful in migraine preventive therapy. Although preliminary reports are encouraging, randomized con- trolled studies with greater number of patients are awaited. Opioid Receptors Opioid analgesics are also potent antimigraine agents and have been used to treat severe cases of migraine attack, particularly when other agents are ineffective. Opioid receptors are predominantly concentrated at brainstem trigeminal nucleus caudalis and are present presynaptically and postsynaptically on the trigeminal sensory A δ and C fiber primary afferent terminals. Opioids inhibit neurogenic plasma extravasation and neurogenic vasodilation and exert their inhibitory effect through prejunctional OP3 ( μ ) receptor activation. Besides OP3 (OP2( μ ) receptor activation, OP2( κ ) recep- tors also play a role, as evidenced by the effectiveness of butorphanol. Spinal opioid receptor activation decreases release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic sites while hyperpolarizing the postsynaptic neuron, thereby block- ing at two distinct sites. Opioid receptors are also found in periaqueductal gray (PAG), brainstem, amygdala, and hypothalamus, and descending pathways from PAG and medullary reticular formation and contribute to central effects of opioids. Blockade of spinal 5-HT3 receptors reduce thermal and mechanical responses after nerve injury, and some preliminary reports indicate its effec- tiveness in patients with fibromyalgia (Hrycaj et al. , 1996). Further studies are needed to develop selective OP3 agonists interfering with nociception without physical dependence or tolerance. 120 The Neurobiology of Migraine and Transformation of Headache Therapy Ch06.qxd 9/2/04 11:02 AM Page 120"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Vanilloid Receptors Vanilloid receptors residing on trigeminal peripheral axons are another potential target. Civamide is a vanilloid receptor agonist chemically related to capsaicin that depletes trigeminal neurons of their neurotransmitter con- tent via desensitizing receptors. In a preliminary study, intranasal civamide was effective in aborting acute attack; however, unwanted effects such as nasal burning were unpleasant (Diamond et al. , 2000). Future Prospects Future directions for prevention and treatment of migraine should target inhibition of both peripheral and central terminals and transmission of nociceptive impulses. Glutamatergic receptors NMDA and AMPA do augment nociception at the spinal level and also medi- ate central sensitization. New NMDA and AMPA receptor antagonists with fewer psychomotor side effects will be tested for their efficacy in migraine pain. The NMDA receptor NR2B subunit is an attractive target for pain management based on (1) its co-local- ization within CGRP positive sensory neurons, and (2) the distinctive pattern of receptor distribution within superficial lamina and within pain associated forebrain structures such as anterior cingulate and insular cortex. Transgenic mice overexpressing NR2B selectively within these forebrain structures exhibit enhanced pain behavior, indicating the significance of the cortical NMDA receptor NR2B subunit in aug- menting the nociception (Wei et al. , 2001). Prostaglandins are products of the cyclo-oxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism. Inhibition of the cyclooxygenase pathway mediates the main effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents that are widely used in migraine treatment. The PGE2 receptors EP1 and EP3 mediate nociception and represent a selective target for interfering with a migraine attack (Stock et al. , 2000). Aborting the migraine attack during the prodrome is a challenging direction that could be targeted at several dis- tinct stages such as by (1) inhibiting susceptibility to spreading depression or blocking spreading depression itself (e.g., possibly by enhancing the activity of the Na + , K + -ATPase pump, inhibition of Ca ++ entry from Cav2.1 channels, NMDA receptor antagonists, NR2B subunit antagonists [Menniti et al. , 2000], or antiepileptic agents [lamotrigine, tonabersat]); (2) blocking factors that link or enhance intrinsic triggers to trigeminovascular activation (e.g., TNF α , IL-1 β , NFkB, atrial natriuretic factor or other proinflammatory molecules); and (3) interfering with mechanisms that lead to the passage of nociceptive molecules from vascular or parenchymal compartments to the perivascular space (e.g., matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, gap junctional blockers). Once an attack is underway, strategies such as targeting purinergic P2X3 and P2X2 receptors, SNS, or proteinase-activated recep- tors, in addition to those approaches discussed previously, could prove promising.

The unique capacity of this neurotoxin to sur- vive the harsh environment of the gut, bind to specific acceptor sites, translocate into a cell, and enzymatically cleave specific proteins involved in membrane fusion sets it apart from any therapy used in medicine today. BoNT has opened a window to the molecular mechanics of cel- lular secretion. Although BoNT remains a potent poison that has potential as a weapon of bioterrorism, its simul- taneous development as a therapy has grown to include more than 50 conditions, covering an array of disorders, including dystonia, spasticity, ophthalmological, gas- trointestinal, urological, orthopaedic, and secretory problems, as well as pain and cosmetics. These thera- peutic applications have emerged over the short span of 25 years since BoNT first became available for clinical use. In the future, the possibility of developing hybrid molecules of BoNT that could selectively inhibit secre- tion or deliver desired molecules through the gastroin- testinal tract and into selected cells will expand the use of BoNT at an exponential rate. The application of BoNT as a therapy has only just begun. BOTULINUM TOXINS BoNT is the consummate example of a deadly biolog- ical agent that has been transformed into a major thera- peutic drug. The toxin has long been recognized as the cause of a potentially severe neurological disease, botu- lism, but in the recent past it has also come to be accepted as a highly beneficial agent for the treatment of neurological disorders. The toxin was originally intro- duced for the treatment of certain neuroophthalmologi- cal problems, but it is now being used for the treatment of a wide range of disorders. Regardless of whether the toxin is acting as an etiological agent to cause disease or as a therapeutic agent to relieve disease, its site and mech- anism of action remain the same. BoNT acts selectively on peripheral cholinergic nerve endings to block acetyl- choline release. Botulinum is derived from the Latin word botulus , meaning sausage, and botulism was originally called “sausage poisoning” because it occurred after ingestion of poorly prepared blood sausage. Although BoNT poi- soning has been occurring for centuries, the first major breakthrough in understanding the disease came with the publication of a series of cases that detailed the clin- ical manifestations of the disease. Justinus Kerner (1786- 1862) was the first to describe the features of botulism, and he went on to collect additional cases and to con- duct experiments on animals and on himself (Ergbuth et al ., 1999; Pearce, 1999). Kerner was also the first to sug- gest that the toxin interrupted peripheral nerve trans- mission, while sparing the brain, and to speculate as to the future therapeutic applications of this agent (Ergbuth et al ., 1999). The second major historical event was the isolation of the causative agent of “sausage poisoning.” In 1895, Van Ermengem isolated an anaerobic bacillus from the rem- nants of a meal that sickened and killed some of the members of a party of musicians in Ellezelle, Belgium 125 CHAPTER 7 Botulinum Toxins: Transformation of a Toxin into a Treatment Cynthia L. Comella, MD Lance L. Simpson, PhD Joseph Jankovic, MD Ch07.qxd 9/1/04 6:36 AM Page 125"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"126 Botulinum Toxins (Sakaguchi, 1983). He named the organism Bacillus bot- ulinus (Caya, 2001). The characteristic signs and symptoms of botulism include a descending flaccid paralysis with prominent cra- nial features (i.e., blurred vision, mydriasis, diplopia, pto- sis, dysphagia, and dysarthria). Initially, the disease was viewed solely as a form of food poisoning (e.g., “sausage poisoning”). As knowledge about the causes of botulism has grown, the etiology of poisoning has been divided into five categories: food-borne, infant, wound, hidden, and inadvertent. More recently, and particularly in the wake of concern about bioterrorism, there has been growing awareness of the phenomenon of inhalation poisoning. Although it is true that the level of understanding of the disease has grown, it is also true that the nomencla- ture for identifying etiologies has become somewhat con- fused. For example, “food-borne” refers to the origin of the toxin, “infant” identifies the susceptible population, “wound” refers to an antecedent event, “inhalation” con- veys information about how the toxin was dispersed, etc. There is no reason to believe that physicians would have any greater difficulty diagnosing or treating the disease if it were described in more conventional terms such as pri- mary infection and primary intoxication. Nevertheless, a historical survey is somewhat compelled to use the terms that were used in the past (Centers for Disease Control, 1998; Cherrington, 1998; Arnon, 2002). Food-borne botulism was the first form of the disease to be recognized. BoNT exists in seven different serotypes, designated A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Almost all food-borne disease can be attributed to serotypes A, B, and E. Serotype F only rarely causes human disease (Centers for Disease Control, 1998) and serotypes C, D, and G are not typically associated with human illness. Food-borne dis- ease arises from ingestion of preformed toxin from poorly preserved food. Thus, food-borne botulism is an illustra- tion of a primary intoxication. Absorption of BoNT through the gut after ingestion of tainted food causes symptoms in approximately 2 to 48 hours, with the major determinants of onset being the concentration of toxin in the suspect food and the amount of this food consumed. The initial symptom after ingestion is usually gastroin- testinal, with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal upset that arise from the contamination of the food with other by- products of bacterial growth. Certain other gastrointesti- nal problems, such as paralytic ileus, are due to toxin-induced blockade of cholinergic transmission. Initial neurological symptoms involve the bulbar mus- cles with blurred vision, diplopia, ptosis, ophthalmople- gia, dysarthria, and dysphagia. This can progress to weakness in the arms and torso, weakness in the legs, and in extreme cases, loss of respiratory function. All of these symptoms are directly attributable to blockade of cholin- ergic transmission by the toxin (Cherrington, 1998). Outbreaks of food-borne botulism were fairly com- mon in the United States in the early twentieth century because of the consumption of home products that were poorly prepared or preserved, as well as to suspect com- mercial products (Meyer, 1956). Many patients who con- tracted the disease eventually died. The mortality resulting from the disease early in the century sometimes exceeded 50%. Although outbreaks continue to be reported (Wainwright et al ., 1988), with 724 cases of food-borne botulism in the United States from 1973 through 1996 (Shapiro et al .,1998), survival has improved. Three reasons can explain this increased survival: (1) an increased awareness of the disease, (2) the development and use of antitoxins, and (3) advances in medical tech- nology, allowing for improved life support. Infant botulism, described in 1976 (Pickett et al ., 1976), occurs when spores of Clostridium botulinum col- onize the gut, particularly the intestine. Clostridial spores do not ordinarily colonize the human gut because they are unable to compete against normal gut flora. There are, however, two notable exceptions: (1) infants of less than 1 year in whom the normal flora has not yet devel- oped, and (2) persons of any age in whom antibiotic use has cleared the gut flora. C. botulinum spores have been found in food, such as honey, soil, and dust. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (CDC, 2003) currently recommends avoiding honey in infants younger than 1 year. Most cases of infant botulism, however, are not traceable to a single food source. Currently, infant botulism is the most common form of botulism in the United States with 1444 cases of infant botulism reported between 1973 and 1996. (Shapiro et al ., 1998; CDC, 2003). From 2001 to 2002, the CDC estimated the incidence of infant botulism to be 2 cases per 100,000 live births, with the highest occurrence of 68 per 100,000 found in Staten Island (CDC, 2003). Wound botulism, initially recognized in 1946, occurs as a result of bacterial colonization of deep flesh wounds (Merson and Dowell, 1973). Wound botulism was rare, but increased dramatically in the early 1990s when users of illicit drugs, including injectable drugs and cocaine inhalation, became the most common group affected (Cherrington, 1998; Arnon, 2002). “Hidden botulism” includes those patients with adult botulism in whom no source of toxin can be determined. This type of botulism is likely to be derived primarily from intestinal coloniza- tion with C. botulinum or C. baratti and subsequent pro- duction and absorption of the toxin (CDC, 1998; Caya, 2001). Most at risk for hidden botulism are those with preexisting gastrointestinal pathology (Chia et al .,1986; Cherrington, 1998). The most recently recognized form of botulism is “inadvertent botulism” arising from systemic spread after therapeutic injections of BoNT. Fortunately, these reports Ch07.qxd 9/1/04 6:36 AM Page 126"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"are rare, but they suggest that even with submaximal ther- apeutic doses of BoNT, clinically detectable systemic spread can occur. Thus far, all patients with inadvertent botulism have made complete recovery (Bhatia et al ., 1999; Bakheit et al ., 1997). BoNT treatment has also infre- quently been associated with the exacerbation of previous neuromuscular junction diseases such as myasthenia gravis and Eaton-Lambert syndrome (Tarsy et al ., 2000). Inhalational botulism, although rarely reported (Holzer, 1962), may be potentially the most devastating route if the toxin were to be used as a weapon of bioter- rorism (Arnon et al ., 2001; Park and Simpson, 2003; Simpson, 2004). BoNT received serious consideration as a biological weapon during World War II, and it has sub- sequently been developed as a weapon of mass destruc- tion in many countries throughout the world, including the United States. The U.S. program was discontinued in 1969 to 1970. The possibility of using BoNT to kill large populations has been limited by technical constraints in maintaining potency and stabilizing the toxin. However, an aerosolized form of BoNT has the estimated potential to kill a significant number of people within an estimated 0.5 kilometer distance of release if these technical limita- tions are overcome (Arnon et al ., 2001). In stark contrast to the grim picture of botulism and bioterrorism, BoNT has emerged over the past two decades as an important medical treatment, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in several dystonic and nondystonic neurological disorders, including blepharospasm, hemifacial spasm, strabismus, and cervical dystonia (Botox® Package Insert, 2000; Myobloc™ Package insert, 2000). The first speculation that BoNT could be used as a therapeutic agent was made in the late 1800s by Justinius Kerner (Ergbuth and Naumann, 1999). The crystallization and purification of BoNT A in 1946 opened the door for realization of its clinical potential (Lamanna et al ., 1946; Lamanna, 1959; Schantz and Johnson, 1997). The initial use of BoNT as a therapeutic tool was pioneered by Alan Scott, MD, through a collaboration with Edward Schantz, PhD, beginning in the late 1960s (Schantz and Johnson, 1997). In 1973, the first use of BoNT to provide a graded reduc- tion of muscle activity in nonhuman primates was reported (Scott et al ., 1973). The first use in humans was reported by Scott in 1980, when 56 injections of botu- linum A toxin were given to humans for correction of strabismus (Scott, 1980). The first double-blind, placebo- controlled study of BoNT, published in 1987, established this treatment modality as safe and effective in cranial- cervical dystonia (Jankovic and Orman, 1987). Since then, the uses of BoNT have expanded to other forms of dystonia and to other neurological and non-neurological disorders (TTA, 1990; Jankovic and Brin, 1991). There are now more than 50 “off-label” uses of BoNT (Jost and Kohl, 2000; Jankovic, 2004). Current applications of BoNT span a broad spectrum of disorders, from neuro- logical to cosmetic (Table 7.1). This review focuses on the important events in understanding the pharmacology of BoNT and its evolution from a potent poison to an effective treatment for various neurological conditions (Table 7.2). PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIONS OF BOTULINUM TOXIN In the mid-part of the last century, two significant advances were made in our understanding of botulinum toxin. First, the peripheral cholinergic nerve ending was Botulinum Toxins 127 TABLE 7.1 Time Line of Major Events in the Transformation of Botulinum Toxin into a Therapeutic Agent 1820 Justinius Kerner describes clinical features of “sausage poisoning” and postulates the peripheral action of BoNT 1895 Van Ermengem isolates the causative organism, calling it Bacillus botulinus 1930s Investigation of BoNT as a weapon of warfare 1946 Crystallization of BoNT serotype A 1946 Wound botulism described 1970s Description of pharmacology and structure of botu linum toxin serotypes 1976 Infant botulism described 1973 First report of BoNT A application as a potential ther- apeutic agent in nonhuman primates 1979 Production of 200 g of crystallized BoNT A for use in humans 1980 First report of BoNT A as a treatment for strabismus and blepharospasm 1984-1989 Investigational use of BoNT A (Oculinum, Smith Kettlewell) for treatment of focal dystonias, hemifacial spasm, and spasticity 1987 First double-blind, placebo-controlled study on BoNT 1989 FDA orphan drug approval in the United States of BoNT A as Botox (Allergan) for blepharospasm, strabismus, and other disorders of the seventh cranial nerve 1991 Approval of BoNT A as Dysport (Ipsen) in the United Kingdom 2000 FDA approval in U.S. of BoNT A as Botox (Allergan) and BoNT B as Myobloc (Elan) for use in cervical dystonia 2000 Recognition that antibody-mediated resistance to botu- linum toxin therapy was a major cause of nonre- sponse to treatment 2000-2003 Continued investigation into other uses Approval for cosmetic application Ch07.qxd 9/1/04 6:36 AM Page 127"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"identified as the target organ for toxin action; further- more, the transmitter release mechanism was identified as the specific site of toxin action. Second, the botulinum toxin molecule was isolated and characterized. This work revealed that the toxin is a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 150,000. This early work on botulinum toxin was reviewed by a number of authors (Sugiyama, 1980; Gunderson, 1980; Simpson, 1981; DasGupta, 1994). During the latter half of the last century, there were again two major advances. In one line of investigation, botulinum toxin action was fractionated into several steps, including binding, internalization, and intracellu- lar poisoning (Simpson, 1980, 1981). The toxin was shown to block transmitter release by acting as a zinc- dependent endoprotease to cleave specific polypeptides that are essential for exocytosis (Montecucco and Shiavo, 1993). In another line of investigation, consid- erable progress was made in defining the structure of the toxin molecule. This included molecular biology studies in which the genes encoding the toxin were sequenced, and from which amino acids could be deduced, as well as crystallization studies in which three-dimensional structures of the toxin were deter- mined. This work, too, has been reviewed by various authors (Minton, 1995; Popoff and Marvaud, 1999; Lacy and Stevens, 1999). BoNT is synthesized by C. botulinum , C. butyricum , and C. baratii , all of which are anaerobic spore- forming bacilli. C. botulinum is a common bacterium that is widely dispersed in the environment. The spores are heat resistant, and they can germinate to produce toxin in the appropriate environment of anaerobic conditions, low acidity, and liquid medium, as found in some foods (Cherington, 1998). The toxin is ingested and absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract into the systemic circulation (Maksymowych et al ., 1999). BoNT is synthesized in seven immunologically dis- tinct serotypes, designated A to G (Hathaway, 1990). The serotypes most often associated with human illness are A, B, and E (Shapiro et al ., 1998). Serotype F only rarely causes human disease, and serotypes C, D, and G are not typically associated with human disease. It should be noted, however, that serotype C does paralyze human neuromuscular transmission (Coffield et al ., 1997). The clinical effects caused by poisoning by the various serotypes are similar, although there may be individual distinctions. For example, BoNT/B appears to have more profound autonomic effects than other serotypes, caus- ing intense dry mouth, loss of visual accommodation, and papillary abnormalities, even when muscle weakness is minimal (Jenzer et al ., 1975; Racette et al ., 2002; Dressler and Benecke, 2003). BoNT is synthesized and released from bacteria in a complex multimeric form. BoNT/A, for example, is released as part of a noncovalent complex that includes other proteins, such as hemagglutinin (HA), and non- toxin, nonhemagglutinin (NTNH) (Simpson, 2000). These auxiliary proteins play a key role in the phenome- non of oral poisoning. The complex of BoNT, HA, and NTNH is surprisingly resistant to the harsh conditions of low pH and proteolytic enzymes found in the gut. Thus, in the absence of HA and NTNH, BoNT is much less active as an oral poison (Maksymowych et al ., 1999). On the other hand, these auxiliary proteins play no role in the ability of the toxin to block cholinergic transmission. The BoNT molecule itself is synthesized as a rela- tively inactive single chain polypeptide with a molecular mass of approximately 150,000. Enzymatic nicking of the polypeptide by bacterial or gut proteases results in an activated di-chain molecule, composed of a heavy chain (approximately 100,000) and a light chain (approximately 50,000) linked by a disulfide bond. The carboxyterminal half of the heavy chain (H c ) plays a critical role in toxin binding to the cholinergic mem- brane, the aminoterminal half of the heavy chain (H n ) is essential for translocation in the cytosol, and the light chain is an enzyme with endoprotease activity (Simpson et al ., 1993, 2001). 128 Botulinum Toxins TABLE 7.2 Clinical Uses of Botulinum Toxins Ophthalmological Strabismus Nystagmus Apraxia of eye lid opening Protective ptosis Dystonia Blepharospasm Cervical dystonia Spasmodic dysphonia Oromandibular dystonia Limb dystonia Occupational dystonia Spasticity Poststroke Multiple sclerosis Cerebral palsy Spinal cord injury Other neurological disorders Hemifacial spasm Palatal myoclonus Tremor Tics Parkinson’s disease Tremor Freezing gait Clenched fist Bruxism Myokymia Pain Headache Migraine Tension headache Fibromyalgia Low back pain Painful muscle spasm Radiculopathy Gastrointestinal disorders Achalasia Anal sphincter spasm Constipation Urological Vaginismus Urinary sphincter spasm Spastic bladder Cosmetic Brow furrows Wrinkles Miscellaneous Essential hyperhidrosis Sialorrhea Stuttering Ch07.qxd 9/1/04 6:36 AM Page 128"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Each serotype of BoNT binds to serotype-specific acceptor sites on the presynaptic nerve terminal (Black and Dolly, 1986; Schiavo et al ., 1993a). The fact that BoNT acts preferentially on cholinergic nerve terminals is thought to be due to the enrichment of these acceptor sites on cholinergic membranes. The identity of the bind- ing sites for botulinum toxin has not been conclusively established, although there is mounting evidence for the involvement of sialic acid-containing molecules. BoNT enters the nerve terminal through a progression of two events. The toxin crosses the plasma membrane by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and it subsequently pen- etrates the endosome membrane by pH-induced translo- cation (Coffield et al ., 1994). It is a certainty that the light chain reaches the cytosol, because it is this portion of the holotoxin that possesses enzymatic activity. However, it is unclear whether the heavy chain escapes the endosome to reach the cytosol. The light chain of BoNT is a highly specific endopro- tease (Rosetto et al ., 2002) that cleaves peptides involved in vesicle fusion. The proteins involved in vesicle docking and fusion for neurotransmitter release, the SNARE ( s oluble N -ethlymaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein re ceptor) proteins, were identified in the early 1990s (Barinaga, 1993; Sollner and Rothman, 1994). The preferred substrates for BoNT action are synaptosomal- associated protein of 25kDa (SNAP-25), v esicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP, but also known as synapto- brevin), and syntaxin (Catsicas et al ., 1994). Serotypes A and E cleave SNAP-25, serotypes B, D, F, and G cleave VAMP, and serotype C cleaves both syntaxin and SNAP- 25 (Blasi et al .,1993; Schiavo et al ., 1993a and b). These three polypeptides, in association with several other intraneuronal polypeptides, are essential for vesicle- mediated transmitter release. Therefore, toxin action on these polypeptides produces blockade of exocytosis, which in turn accounts for neuromuscular and auto- nomic blockade (Simpson et al ., 1993, 2001; Humeau et al ., 2000). SNAP-25, VAMP, and syntaxin are not unique to peripheral cholinergic nerve endings (MacKenzie et al ., 1982; Linial, 1997). To the contrary, these polypeptides appear to be involved in release of most neurotransmit- ters. They are also integral to exocytosis in non-neuronal cells, such as gland cells. The presence of the high affin- ity H c acceptor sites on cholinergic nerve terminals accounts for the selective intoxication of these neurons (Schiavo et al ., 2000). The introduction of BoNT into noncholinergic cells, which can be accomplished by a variety of experimental techniques, blocks release of many chemical mediators. Botulinum toxin does not appear to cross the blood- brain barrier. The effects of BoNT are predominantly at cholinergic synapses outside the central nervous system (Grandas et al ., 1998); however, central nervous system effects cannot be excluded. Labeled BoNT/A injected into muscle has been shown to penetrate into the spinal cord via retrograde neuronal axonal transport into the ventral roots and then alter the discharge patterns of the abducens nucleus (Wiegand et al ., 1976; Moreno- Lopez et al ., 1997). This is similar to the pathway used by tetanus toxin, but the effect of BoNT on spinal neurons is not marked and does not reproduce the effects of tetanus toxin. BoNT has been shown to transiently reor- ganize inhibitory and excitatory intracortical circuits. This cortical effect likely arises indirectly from peripheral mechanisms (Berardelli et al ., 2002), although the clinical effects at this time remain to be investigated. The action of BoNT at the neuromuscular junction is to interrupt transmission and in effect to denervate mus- cle (Montecucco et al ., 1996). This chemodenervation effect persists for weeks to months. The duration of effect may depend on serotype (Sloop et al ., 1997; Dolly et al ., 2002; Dolly, 2003). The mechanism for this extended duration has been hypothesized to arise from either con- tinued protease activity within the cell or from persistent interference by cleaved substrate with normal membrane fusion (Dolly et al ., 2002). Currently, there is no known way to reverse the paralytic effects of BoNT after it has been internalized. Both active and passive immunization can inactivate toxin in the circulation, but antibody can- not enter nerves to neutralize internalized toxin. Recovery from BoNT occurs spontaneously and may take months to be complete (Hambleton, 1992). At the cellular level, 3 to 4 weeks after a single injection of BoNT/A in mice, there is sprouting of new processes along the nerve axon, with formation of multiple synapses with the muscle and up regulation of the mus- cle nicotinic receptors. Subsequently, the neuronal sprouts undergo regression and the original synaptic con- nection is restored, with restoration of the original neu- romuscular junction (Aoki, 2001; dePaiva et al ., 1999). THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS OF BoNT One of the interesting aspects of BoNT as a thera- peutic modality has been its development and initial approval as an orphan drug by the U.S. FDA in 1989. The Orphan Drug Act provides an avenue for approval of a product that treats a rare disease affecting fewer than 200,000 Americans. Despite the fact that BoNT was the most potent neurotoxin known, the initial approval of BoNT as BOTOX ® was based on one placebo-controlled study (Jankovic and Orman, 1987) and a number of open-label uncontrolled studies and published clinical observations in 1684 blepharospasm and 2322 strabismus patients (Walton, 1999; BOTOX ® Package Insert, 2000). Botulinum Toxins 129 Ch07.qxd 9/1/04 6:36 AM Page 129"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Once approved by the FDA, the “off label” uses of BoNT rapidly increased, using doses far exceeding those ini- tially approved (TTA, 1990; NIH Consensus Statement, 1991). This gave rise to concerns regarding safety and immunogenicity and led to the more stringent require- ments by the FDA for controlled studies before approval of BOTOX ® and MyoBloc ™ for the indication of cervi- cal dystonia in 2000. Yet most disorders now treated with BoNT do not have adequate assessments of dosing or appropriate techniques of administration, and the effi- cacy and safety data remain largely derived from un- controlled clinical experience (Jost and Kohl, 2000). However, clinical experience with BoNT for a variety of disorders has largely shown long-term efficacy and safety (Jankovic and Schwartz, 1993; Kessler et al ., 1999; Hsiung et al . 2002; Jankovic, 2004; Naumann and Jankovic, 2004). BOTULINUM TOXIN TREATMENT OF BLEPHAROSPASM AND HEMIFACIAL SPASM The first clinical applications of BoNT as a therapeu- tic intervention were in strabismus, hemifacial spasm, and blepharospasm, a form of focal dystonia. Dystonia is a syndrome characterized by involuntary sustained muscle contractions that usually cause twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. (Fahn et al ., 1998). Focal dystonia involves a single body region, with limited muscle involvement making it most amenable to chemodenervation with BoNT. Focal dystonia affects the neck (cervical dystonia), eyes (blepharospasm), jaw and oral muscles (oromandibular dystonia), larynx and vocal cords (spasmodic dysphonia), and limbs (arm/leg dysto- nia, writer’s cramp). Botulinum toxin has been used extensively as a symptomatic treatment in each of these conditions. Before the introduction of BoNT injections, the treat- ment of dystonia was rarely successful. Although approximately 23% to 55% of dystonia patients benefit from oral pharmacological agents (Greene et al ., 1988), the benefits from oral medications are usually transient, and frequently complicated by systemic side effects. (Jankovic and Orman, 1984; Grandas et al ., 1988). Botulinum toxin injections were first introduced as a treatment for blepharospasm in the early 1980s (Scott et al ., 1985). Subsequent studies showed successful control of facial spasms in 75% to 100% of patients (Mauriello, 1985; Jankovic and Orman, 1987; Mauriello and Coniaria, 1987; Dutton and Buckley, 1988; Mauriello et al ., 1996a; Jitpimolmard et al ., 1998; Mauriello, 2002). Although many of these were observational studies, a limited number of controlled studies in a small cohort of patients confirmed the results of open trials (Jankovic and Orman 1987; Mezaki et al ., 1999). Long-term fol- low-up evaluation of patients receiving multiple treat- ments showed sustained improvement, with reduction in spasm intensity (Dutton, 1996). The mechanism of the clinical improvement was largely due to peripheral mus- cle denervation: this notion is supported by the absence of normalization of blink reflexes after injection (Valls- Sole et al ., 1991; Girlanda et al ., 1996). Subsequent studies were directed toward the refine- ment of injection techniques and reduction of the adverse effects after BoNT injection. The adverse effects of BoNT for blepharospasm largely arose from the local- ized diffusion from the injection site. These local side effects included diplopia, ptosis, lid entropion, and epiphora (Dutton and Buckley, 1988; Patrinely et al ., 1988; Mauriello and Aljian, 1991). Ptosis was one of the most frequent complications of BoNT (Dutton, 1996). The anatomy of the eyelid and face, with the proximity of the levator superioris muscle to the orbicularis oculi muscle, was thought to underlie this frequent effect. The orbicularis oculi muscle is approximately 1 mm thick, with a loose connective tissue fascia plane below it that allows for easy diffusion of the toxin. The orbital septum lies deep to this facial plane. This septum resists diffusion of injected liquid, but may be attenuated in older patients or punctured, allowing free access to the levator muscle. Medial and lateral pretarsal injections (avoiding the mid- line) replaced those into the orbital part of the orbicu- laris oculi muscle, reducing the occurrence of this adverse event (Aramideh et al ., 1995; Albanese et al ., 1996; Jankovic et al ., 1996). Diplopia, a less frequent compli- cation, was usually due to BoNT injections into the medial aspect of the lower eyelid, and diffusion of toxin through the orbital septum into the inferior oblique mus- cle (Wutthiphan et al ., 1997). By omitting injections into this area of the lower lid, diplopia was minimized (Frueh et al ., 1988). BoNT was also found to diffuse into the lower facial muscles, with a reduction of compound mus- cle action potentials and motor evoked potentials occur- ring in lower facial muscles (Eleopra et al ., 1996; Girlanda et al ., 1996). If pronounced, this local diffusion also caused facial weakness and asymmetry. The use of BoNT for blepharospasm provided an opportunity to assess both the electrophysiological and pathological time course of BoNT effect in human mus- cle. After treatment with BoNT into the orbicularis oculi muscle, serial electromyographical examinations showed marked denervation changes with increased jitter and blocking appearing at 1 week. These changes were asso- ciated with clinical improvement. After a mean of 116 days, denervation of the m uscle persisted but at a reduced level, despite a return to baseline clinical status (Bogucki et al ., 1999). Despite prolonged denervation after repeated injections, changes in the orbicularis oculi 130 Botulinum Toxins Ch07.qxd 9/1/04 6:36 AM Page 130"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"muscle were minimal, with few showing any evidence of fibrosis, indicating that the effects of BoNT injections, while beneficial for months after each injection, do not result in irreversible muscle atrophy or degenerative changes if administered chronically (Borodic and Ferrante, 1992). The FDA approved BoNT serotype A in 1989 for the indications of blepharospasm, strabismus, and other disorders of the facial nerve (including hemi- facial spasm). BOTULINUM TOXIN TREATMENT OF CERVICAL DYSTONIA Approximately 5 years after BoNT treatment was used in low doses for the treatment of blepharospasm, investigations into the usefulness of BoNT in higher doses for cervical dystonia began. Over the past 2 decades, open-label and controlled studies have shown the effectiveness of BoNT A as a treatment for cervical dystonia (Ceballos-Baumann, 2001). As in blepharospasm, the early studies were mostly open-label, uncontrolled investigations (Tsui et al ., 1985; Stell et al ., 1988; Lorentz et al ., 1990; Blackie and Lees, 1990), but taken together demonstrated the promise of a new therapy for this disorder, with benefit that could be sustained over repeated injections. Furthermore, the nonmotor features of cervical dystonia, including dis- ability, depression, and quality of life, also showed sig- nificant improvement with BoNT treatment (Jahanshahi and Marsden, 1991; Brans et al ., 1998; Brefel-Courbon et al ., 2000; Jankovic et al. 2004). The first controlled study of BoNT A was conducted in 21 patients with cervical dystonia using a crossover design of active BoNT A at 100 Units and placebo. In the 19 patients who completed the trial, there was significant but modest improvement (Tsui et al ., 1986). However, another controlled study in 20 patients found only subjective ben- efit without any objective changes based on the Tsui scale (Gelb et al ., 1989), and an additional study observed no improvement in any measure when administering a fixed dose of BoNT into the same muscles of all patients (Koller et al .,1990). The need to develop appropriate methodology to assess this new therapy was clear. Using a different outcome measure, the Columbia Torticollis Rating Scale, Greene and associates (1990) showed both objective and subjective improvement following BoNT, with an open-label extension demonstrating that addi- tional benefit accrued if higher dosages of BoNT were used. This positive outcome was found by a number of additional investigators (Jankovic and Orman, 1987; Moore and Blumhardt, 1991; Lorentz et al ., 1991). The insights gained during this early period of investi- gation were used in developing the large, pivotal clinical trials of BoNT A and B to obtain approval by the FDA for these drugs. BoNT A (BOTOX) was assessed using a run-in, two-treatment period design to determine the optimal pattern of injection, with flexibility for dosing and muscle selection. The outcome measure, the Cervical Dystonia Severity Scale, was tested for validity before its use in the study. A large number of patients (N = 170) were enrolled in the randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled treatment period and monitored for 10 weeks after treatment. This study showed that there was signif- icant improvement of BoNT A group over placebo for all outcome measures. It further demonstrated that the occurrence of adverse effects across multiple centers was small, with the most common being muscle weakness (7.9%) and dysphagia (6.8%) (BOTOX ® package insert). Although only reported in an abstract, this study served as the pivotal clinical trial for approval by the FDA of BoNT for cervical dystonia in the United States. BoNT serotype B was introduced as a treatment for cervical dystonia in 1997 (Lew et al ., 1997). The pivotal controlled clinical trials were published in 1999 (Brashear et al ., 1999; Brin et al ., 1999). The methodology used in these two pivotal studies took into consideration many of the limitations in prior studies, allowing a flexible injec- tion pattern and using a previously established rating scale for cervical dystonia, the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS). In addi- tion, these studies included a method to prevent possible unblinding during the course of investigation by appoint- ing a separate rating investigator who did not administer the BoNT nor record the adverse events. The positive outcome of both of these studies definitively confirmed the efficacy of BoNT for the treatment of cervical dysto- nia, and provided a methodology that could be useful in future studies of other agents for this disorder. In one of the studies (Brin et al ., 1999), only patients with cervical dystonia who had lost sensitivity to BoNT A were enrolled. The benefit seen in the BoNT A-resistant patients using a different serotype provided strong evi- dence that the BoNT serotypes were distinct. The avail- ability of the two serotypes provided clinicians with valuable treatment options, especially for those patients who had ceased to benefit from treatment with one serotype. Optimal treatment using BoNT is largely dependent on appropriate clinical assessment, knowledge of func- tional anatomy, selection of the most involved muscles as targets for injection, and the use of appropriate dosage and injection techniques (Koller et al ., 1990; Gelb et al ., 1991; Odergren et al ., 1998; Poewe et al ., 1998). The long clinical experience using BoNT for cervical dystonia has provided extraordinary insights into the use of neurotox- ins as a treatment. In one clinical series, Brashear and colleagues (2000) retrospectively monitored 151 cervical Botulinum Toxins 131 Ch07.qxd 9/1/04 6:36 AM Page 131"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"dystonia patients who had received at least one treat- ment. 20% to 33% of their patients discontinued treatment. Several reasons were cited: (1) a lack of benefit from treat- ment was the primary reason, (2) the occurrence of adverse effects after injection was second, and (3) the expense of continued treatment. Treatment failure can arise for several reasons. Apart from immunological resistance to BoNT, which will be discussed below, there have been changes in the technique of administration that have improved the outcome. Cervial dystonia is a dynamic disorder that can change in the quality of the movement and in the occurrence of pain. This has been shown by several investigators (Gelb et al ., 1991; Munchau et al ., 2001). Munchau et al ., (2001) showed that using synchronized video and electromyographical recordings, approximately half of cervical dystonia patients will have spontaneously changing patterns of muscle activation. These patients did not show an equiva- lent benefit after injection as those patients with unchang- ing muscle activation. Injection of uninvolved muscles may reduce or negate the effect of treatment. Although objective techniques have been successfully applied to assess head position in cervical dystonia, the additional equipment, training, and time needed to use these meth- ods preclude routine application in a clinical setting (Albani et al ., 2001). The clinical examination remains the gold standard for assessment in CD and other disorders when choosing appropriate muscles for treatment. The use of EMG in conjunction with the clinical exam- ination in both muscle selection and targeting injections has been evaluated in CD and can be extrapolated to other disorders with complex muscle activation patterns. Investigators using EMG guidance have reported increased benefits in their patients and the potential to use smaller doses of toxin for treatment (Dubinsky et al ., 1991; Brans et al ., 1995; Comella et al .,1992; Ostergaard et al ., 1994). A single-blinded study of consecutive cervi- cal dystonia patients randomized to injection with or without EMG assistance demonstrated that there was a greater magnitude of improvement and a greater number of patients with a marked improvement when EMG was used (Comella et al ., 1992). EMG is thought to increase accuracy of injection into muscle, although alternatively, it may be in enhancing the clinical examination in the process of muscle selection (Gelb et al ., 1991; Brans et al ., 1995; Speelman and Brans, 1995; Ostergaard et al ., 1996; Finsterer et al ., 1997; Ajax et al ., 1998; Dressler, 2000; Van Gerpen et al ., 2000). Although the deep cervical muscles have been shown to be spontaneously overactive in 68% of consecutive cervical dystonia patients, needle placement in these muscles using clinical landmarks alone is accurate in only 50% of attempts (Speelman and Brans, 1995). The success of the cervical dystonia studies provided the impetus for a broader application of BoNT not only as a treatment for cervical dystonia, but also in other disorders in which muscle overactivity was the predomi- nant disorder. BOTULINUM TOXIN TREATMENT OF SPASTICITY With the observation that BoNT could improve mus- cle spasms related to dystonia, studies were undertaken to assess whether similar efficacy could be demonstrated in spasticity (Simpson, 2002). Spasticity is a velocity- dependent increase in muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes as a part of the upper motor neuron syndrome that arises from numerous etiologies (Lance, 1990). Spasticity is more common than dystonia and currently represents the largest population with a neurological dis- order that may be amenable to treatment with BoNT. In contrast to dystonia, however, spasticity is a complex syndrome, combining elements of weakness, impaired dexterity, pain, stiffness, and muscle spasms. With chronic spasticity, there can be shortening and fibrosis in the muscle, causing contractures. The varied manifesta- tions of spasticity and the diverse populations in which it is found have presented a challenge to clinicians to iden- tify the particular patient group that may benefit most from BoNT. The initial goal of BoNT treatment for spasticity was a reduction in muscle tone, as measured by the Ashworth scale or goniometry. The concept that these quantitative goals may not be sufficient to assess the effects of BoNT on spasticity led to the development of additional goals that focused on improving motor function by balancing muscle forces across joints: health-related quality of life, decreasing caregiver burden, decreasing pain from spas- ticity, and improving self-esteem (Koman et al ., 2003). Spasticity disorders that have been treated with BoNT include multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, and stroke. Published results were variable, and most studies were either open-label or controlled studies in small numbers of patients. Patient selection, method- ology, and outcome measures differed among studies. A consistent finding among these studies was a reduction in muscle tone after BoNT injection, but improvement in functional outcomes was not consistent and proved diffi- cult to demonstrate convincingly (van Kuijk et al ., 2002; Burbaud et al ., 1996; Pittock et al ., 2003; Graham, 2000; Corry et al ., 1997). In selected patients, there has been evidence that BoNT improves function. A large placebo-controlled study demonstrated improvement in a simple functional scale after BoNT treatment for wrist and finger spastic- ity following stroke (Brashear et al ., 2002). Controlled studies of cerebral palsy have shown improved gait (Sutherland et al ., 1996; Baker et al ., 2002), increased 132 Botulinum Toxins Ch07.qxd 9/1/04 6:36 AM Page 132"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"arm and hand function, (Fehlings et al ., 2000), reduction in pain, and increased comfort and tolerability of brac- ing (Pierson et al ., 1996). Other studies have shown improved ability to perform simple tasks (Hurvitz et al ., 2003) and improved ability to perform hygienic measures (Snow et al ., 1990). In some, but not all studies, improve- ment persisted for as long as 6 months after injection (Slawek and Klimont, 2003), although long-term improvement may be attributed to the simultaneous and judicious use of rehabilitation therapies. Currently, BoNT has been approved in some European countries for the treatment of spasticity. BOTULINUM TOXIN TREATMENT OF TREMOR DISORDERS Several studies have assessed the usefulness of BoNT for the treatment of essential hand tremor. Two controlled trials demonstrated improvement in tremor severity rat- ing scales and tremor amplitude as measured using accelerometery. Both studies, however, failed to show con- sistent improvement in functional outcomes, possibly because of occurrence of adverse effects. A prominent adverse effect was the occurrence of a dose-dependent mild to moderate finger weakness or reduced grip strength in 30% to 70% of patients (Jankovic et al ., 1996; Brin et al ., 2001). However, each of these studies used fixed doses of BoNT and required injection into four specified forearm muscles: the flexor carpi radialis and ulnaris and extensor carpi radialis and ulnaris, regardless of specific tremor movement, and allowed injections without EMG guidance. In contrast, three open-label studies allowed injections into variable muscles depending on the tremor manifestations showed significant improvement in func- tional ability and mild to moderate improvement in tremor amplitude (Pachetti et al ., 2000). In these studies, finger weakness was much less common and less severe, partly as a result of exclusion of the extensor carpi muscles and adjustment of BoNT dosage. BOTULINUM TOXIN TREATMENT OF HEADACHE AND PAIN BoNT has been effective in reducing pain in cervical dystonia and spasticity. The current status of BoNT and its applications to headache and other pain disorders is promising but remains to be established (Brin et al ., 2002). Current evidence is largely anecdotal. One con- trolled study in migraine showed improvement (Silberstein et al ., 2000); another assessing tension headache did not (Rollnik et al ., 2000). The mechanism of analgesic action of BoNT is unknown but has been proposed to be related to yet poorly understood effects on sensory nociceptive systems, particularly on substance P (Van den Bergh et al ., 1996). Further carefully designed investigations are needed. The collective experience gained through the applica- tion of BoNT treatment for cervical dystonia ble- pharospasm, spasticity, tremor, and other neurological disorders have clearly established BoNT as the treatment of choice in some disorders and a less reliable means of controlling others. The essential requirement for well- designed, controlled assessments of BoNT that use its unique mechanism of action and recognize its limitations has also become apparent. IMMUNOLOGY AND RESISTANCE TO BoNT The extensive use of BoNT in CD showed that a major limitation to repeated BoNT treatment was the development of resistance. Botulinum toxin is a protein that serves as an antigen when injected repeatedly into humans. The development of an antibody response to an antigen is dependent on several factors: the presence of an adjuvant (a substance that increases the immune response), the persistence of the antigen in the tissues, and the frequency of exposure to and quantity of the antigen. In addition, other factors, such as the genetic make-up of an individual, may increase the susceptibility for that individual to develop antibodies to a particular antigen (Critchfield, 2000; Jankovic, 2002). Antibody formation in response to BoNT is a desirable event in people with frequent exposure to the toxin and risk of contracting botulism. Hence, in endemic areas and in laboratory personnel, vaccinations using toxoid are administered. However, in patients whose clinical condition responds to BoNT, the formation of neutraliz- ing antibodies results in a clinical resistance to the bene- ficial effects. In 1979, Shantz and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin prepared 200 mg of crystallized BoNT A. This small amount was the only commercially available source of toxin in the United States for almost a decade (Schantz and Johnson, 1997). BoNT then became available in two serotypes: BoNT type A, dis- tributed as BOTOX ® (Allergan) and Dysport (Ipsen), and BoNT B as Neurobloc and MyoBloc ™ (Elan). Production practices have been refined and BOTOX ® has been reformulated to provide a lower protein load (25 ng protein/100 units to 5 ng protein/100 units) (Borodic et al ., 1996; Jankovic et al ., 2003). In available serotypes, there is no established dosing equivalency (Sloop et al. , 1997). The factors that predispose to development of anti- bodies have not been identified. Large doses of botulinum Botulinum Toxins 133 Ch07.qxd 9/1/04 6:36 AM Page 133"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"toxin ( ≥ 250 units botulinum toxin A BOTOX ® ), larger cumulative doses, and injections administered at less than 3-month intervals (“booster” injections) have been identi- fied as possible risk factors for the development of resist- ance (Greene et al ., 1994). Botulinum toxin resistance primarily occurs in patients receiving higher doses of toxin for the treatment of disorders such as cervical dys- tonia, and is rare in disorders treated with lower doses, such as blepharospasm or hemifacial spasm. Initially, BoNT resistance was not considered to be common. Early reports suggested a frequency of approx- imately 5% resistance in cervical dystonia patients receiv- ing repeated injections (Jankovic and Schwartz, 1993; Kessler and Benecke, 1997). This observation was based on retrospective assessments of patients at single loca- tions. However, the clinical trials of BoNT serotypes A and B published as the package inserts for the drugs when FDA approval was obtained revealed antibody for- mation to be much more frequent than previously thought. Prospective studies of both Botox and Myobloc are underway to assess the frequency and factors associ- ated with resistance. Antibodies to BoNT are detected using various meth- ods (Goschel et al ., 1997). The mouse protection assay (MPA) is the gold standard method. This assay evaluates the ability of increasing dilutions of a patient’s serum to protect experimental mice from lethal test doses of BoNT. Recently, the mouse hemidiaphragm model with phrenic nerve intact has also been described. The immunoprecipitation assay (IPA) is a simple, rapid tech- nique for detecting antibodies against BoNT. IPA has been found to be both sensitive and specific (Palace et al ., 1998; Dressler and Dirnberger, 2001). Compared to the MPA, IPA was more sensitive than the MPA in detecting BoNT antibodies and shows a positive result earlier than the MPA, suggesting it may predict future unresponsive- ness (Hanna and Jankovic, 1998). The in vitro assays listed previously are expensive and have not yet been shown to predict whether clinical resistance will occur. Using the MPA, Jankovic and colleagues (2003) showed that patients treated with the current BOTOX ® (5 ng pro- tein/100 units) had no evidence of blocking antibodies compared to 9.4% frequency of blocking antibodies in patients treated with the original BOTOX ® (25 ng/100 units) for the same period. In addition to the laboratory tests currently being assessed, a variety of clinical tests have been developed to ascertain whether resistance to the effects of toxin exists. The FTA (frontalis type A test) (Borodic et al ., 1995), the unilateral brow injection (UBI) (Hanna et al ., 1999), the SCM (sternocleidomastoid) test, and the EDB (extensor digitorum brevis) test have all been explored as sensitive methods to detect clinical resistance (but not antibody titers) in patients reporting the secondary failure of BoNT to improve symptoms (Kessler and Benecke, 1997; Sloop et al ., 1997; Birklein and Engbutl, 2000; Dressler et al ., 2000). The basic principle of these clinical tests was to determine whether an injection of BoNT into a spe- cific muscle would cause denervation and atrophy in that muscle. The absence of changes in the muscle after injec- tion suggested loss of sensitivity to BoNT. Although studies are in progress, the tests have not been validated. Treatment of BoNT resistance is problematic. Depletion of the neutralizing antibodies through plasma exchange or immunosuppression using drugs such as mycophenolate has been proposed (Naumann et al ., 1998; Duane et al ., 2000). Because each serotype of BoNT is immunologically distinct, replacing one serotype with another was found to be effective, although the long-term sensitivity of the patient to an alternate serotype of BoNT has not been prospectively evaluated (Greene and Fahu, 1993, 1996; Sheehan and Lees, 1995; Truong et al ., 1997; Chen et al ., 1998; Houser et al ., 1998; Brin et al ., 1999; Aoki, 2001). Preliminary results, how- ever, suggest that the development of blocking antibod- ies to one serotype increases the risk of blocking antibodies to another serotype (Atassi, 2002; Dressler et al ., 2003). FUTURE APPLICATIONS Several distinctive features of BoNT account for its toxicity, but also provide potential avenues for novel uses as a therapeutic agent (Simpson, 2000). First, the ability of the toxin to escape degradation in the gut and be absorbed through binding to the gut epithelial cells allows an avenue for entry of other proteins through an oral route. Second, the absence of a significant immune- mediated response on the part of the host against circu- lating toxin opens the possibility of repeated exposure without resistance. Third, the presence of the high-affin- ity acceptor sites on preganglionic cholinergic neurons allows for the targeted binding of the heavy chain of BoNT on specific cells. Fourth, the enzymatic properties of the light chain that result in “multiplicative” rather than a “stochastic” mechanism of toxicity permits small doses to have extensive effects. Fifth, the selective nature of each serotype to cleave proteins involved in neuro- transmitter release lays open the possibility of selectively inhibiting secretion from other cell types. Sixth, the absence of neuronal degeneration and the reversibility of toxin effects present the opportunity to affect cells, with- out permanent destruction of cell mechanisms. Some of these properties have already led to the use of BoNT as a potent treatment for disorders characterized by muscle overactivity, including dystonia and spasticity as dis- cussed previously. These properties have also been used 134 Botulinum Toxins Ch07.qxd 9/1/04 6:36 AM Page 134"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"in investigations exploring mechanisms of neurotrans- mitter release (Simpson, 2004). Current research is inves- tigating the possibilities of developing hybrid molecules of BoNT that exploit its unique features in order to design molecules that resist degradation within the gut, are not toxic, and deliver agents artificially attached to the BoNT molecule into the cytosol of specific cells (Simpson, et al ., 1999; Simpson, 2000). These could be oral vaccines or other therapeutic drugs. For example, by producing a hybrid consisting of the light chain and H n fraction of the heavy chain and conjugating with a sec- ond protein that binds to noncholinergic cell receptors, it may be possible to harness the enzymatic activity of the light chain in order to inhibit secretion from targeted cells by interrupting vesicle fusion (Foster, 2002). The potential of this powerful neurotoxin to serve as a bene- ficial treatment for a variety of neurological and non- neurological diseases is still being realized.

PD affects approximately 1 million people in North America, with an increasing incidence with age most marked after 60 (Bower et al. , 1999; Van Den Eeden et al. , 2003). The defining features of PD, resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia or motor slowing, are generally well controlled with medications for several years (Lang and Lozano, 1998). However, most often within a decade of disease onset, progressive symptoms of disease such as freezing, falling, and dementia, and drug-induced side effects such as motor complications substantially reduce quality of life for PD patients (Olanow, 2003). Therefore the most important goal for PD therapeutics is the devel- opment of effective and enduring neuroprotective ther- apy to slow or stop disease early in its course or ideally even before the onset of symptoms during the preclinical disease phase. During the past several decades molecular neuro- science and genetics have markedly increased our understanding of PD pathobiology and have dramati- cally accelerated development of PD therapeutics. PD has served as a model for neurodegenerative disorders in that advances in neuroscience have informed clinical therapeutics and in turn have been informed by clini- cal research. For example, PD is characterized by degen- eration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (Bernheimer et al. , 1973), and the mainstay of PD therapy remains dopamine replace- ment (Agid et al. , 1999; Ahlskog, 2001; Olanow et al. , 2001). Clinical studies in PD therapeutics continue to elucidate dopamine neurobiology and pharmacology. Conversely, neuropathological and neurochemical stud- ies demonstrating the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic and other subcortical neurons in PD have led to potential therapies to replace those cells such as neurotransplantation for PD (Freed et al. , 2001; Olanow et al. , 2003a). Most recently basic and clinical scientists have each contributed to the challenge of neu- roprotective therapy for PD, on the one hand identify- ing numerous targets for potential therapies and on the other hand working to define the clinical studies to demonstrate neuroprotection. Neuroprotection for PD may be defined as a mean- ingful and enduring slowing in the progressive disability of PD associated with a slowing in the neuronal degen- eration known to occur in PD (Figure 8.1). Neurorescue or neurorestoration refers to improvement in symptoms of PD associated with partial or complete restoration of neuronal function (Olanow et al. , 2003b; Shoulson, 1998c). Neuroprotection may have different meanings or at least the meaning may have a different emphasis for the various constituencies with a stake in PD research. For patients and families of patients, neuroprotection means a longer period of better quality of life. For clini- cians, neuroprotection may mean slowed worsening of clinical symptoms, delay of disease milestones such as falling or dementia, and longer duration of effective treatment with symptomatic medications. For neurosci- entists, neuroprotection is defined by slowing in the neu- ronal degeneration characteristic of PD. For regulatory agencies, neuroprotection may mean demonstrating slowed worsening of symptoms not explained by a 141 CHAPTER 8 Prospects for Slowing the Progression of Parkinson’s Disease Kenneth Marek, MD Ch08.qxd 9/2/04 10:52 AM Page 141"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"symptomatic effect, associated with slowed loss of neu- rons. Studies assessing neuroprotection must balance the requirements of these different constituencies with what is practical in clinical research. This review focuses on recent studies evaluating disease-modifying drugs for PD and in particular the challenge of assessing and demon- strating neuroprotection. NEUROSCIENCE TARGETS AND ANIMAL MODELS Molecular neuroscience has transformed the develop- ment of potential neuroprotective or disease-modifying drugs. Research has identified and has begun to elucidate numerous molecular targets and biochemical pathways potentially relevant to neurodegeneration and disease progression (Dawson and Dawson, 2002; Mandel et al. , 2003). These strategies, summarized briefly next, are directed at both dopaminergic degeneration, in particu- lar, and neuronal degeneration, in general (Table 8.1). Molecular genetic studies have been especially useful both in identifying genes that may be causative or associ- ated with PD and in uncovering functional mechanisms subserved by products of those genes that may provide targets for neuroprotective drugs. Mutations in a-synu- clein and parkin have both resulted in defects in the ubiqutin-proteasome system (UPS), now thought critical to neuronal degeneration (McNaught et al. , 2003; Miller and Wilson, 2003; Skipper and Farrer, 2002) and provid- ing new targets for therapeutic intervention. Potential targets include drugs to reduce abnormal protein folding or vaccine strategies to reduce synuclein deposition. Further elucidation of some of the specific pathways leading to cell death in PD and related disorders has also provided several sites for pharmacological intervention. Specifically, drugs that inhibit the caspase cascade, thereby potentially slowing cell death mechanisms including CEP1347 and related compounds, are being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials (Harris et al. , 2002; Maroney et al. , 2001). The propargylamines, compounds including selegiline, rasagiline, and TCH346, which may reduce apoptotic cell death, are also being studied (Andringa et al. , 2003; Maruyama et al. , 2002; Parkinson Study Group, 2002a; Tatton et al. , 2002; Youdim et al. , 2003). Reducing potential glutamatergic excititoxicity is yet another approach to slowing cell death (Greenamyre et al. , 1992; Spooren et al. , 2001). Relatively weak gluta- matergic drugs, including ramacemide and rulizole, have 142 Prospects for Slowing the Progression of Parkinson’s Disease Dopamine Neurons Motor Ratings Preclinical A Symptomatic Diagnosis Natural History of PD No Treatment Dopamine Neurons Motor Ratings Preclinical B Symptomatic Diagnosis Natural History of PD Symptomatic Treatment Dopamine Neurons Motor Ratings Preclinical C Symptomatic Diagnosis Natural History of PD Neuroprotective Treatment FIGURE 8.1 Model for progression loss of neuronal function in PD and development of clinical symptoms.

More recently modulators of glutamate receptors have been proposed as drugs that may modify the progression of PD cell death (Marino et al. , 2003). There is substantial evidence that mitochon- drial function is abnormal in PD, specifically a defect in complex I in the electron transport chain, and that this bioenergetic deficit contributes to degeneration (Beal, 2003; Greenamyre et al. , 2001; Schapira et al. , 1998). Both laboratory and clinical studies have suggested that drugs designed to bypass complex I to restore mitochon- drial function may slow the progression of PD (Shults and Schapira, 2001). Growing evidence has also indi- cated that PD may be associated with an inflammatory response in the brain marked by activated microglial cells (Hirsch et al. , 2003; McGeer et al. , 2001). This provides yet another potential therapeutic approach to slowing the degeneration of PD—using drugs aimed at reducing this inflammatory response as has been reported in Alzheimer’s disease (Etminan et al. , 2003). Growth factors and trophic factors may also slow loss of dopaminergic neurons and/or restore dopaminergic neuron function. In particular glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) appears to have specific effects on dopaminergic neurons (Brundin, 2002; Ugarte et al. , 2003), and studies of GDNF administered by surgical infusion are under way in PD patients (Gill et al. , 2003). In recent studies other factors such as stress or exercise appear to activate pathways leading to increased GDNF, providing another approach for slowing of PD progres- sion (Cohen et al. , 2003). Other trophic factors including neurturin and sonic hedgehog may also have protective effects on dopamine neurons (Kim et al. , 2003; Oiwa et al. , 2002). Neuroimmunophilin ligands, small molecule growth factors, also have demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo changes on dopamine neurons, possibly consistent with neuronal sprouting (Gold and Villafranca, 2003; Zhang et al. , 2001). These orally active drugs have been well tolerated in PD patients, and clinical studies to assess the effects of neuroimmunophilin ligands in PD progression are in progress (Seibyl et al. , 2002). Several recent studies have examined the potential disease-modifying effects of dopaminergic drugs, com- monly used to treat PD for their symptomatic benefit. Preclinical and animal data have provided a clear ratio- nale to consider whether levodopa, dopamine agonists, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors might influence PD progression. Levodopa, the mainstay of PD sympto- matic treatment, has been postulated to have both neuro- protective and neurotoxic effects (Agid, 1998; Fahn, 1997). Recent studies have shown that levodopa-induced oxidative stress may hasten neurodegeneration and specifically may increase synuclein deposition in vitro (Asanuma et al. , 2003; Conway et al. , 2001), but no evi- dence for levodopa toxicity has been found in vivo (Datla et al. , 2001; Murer et al. , 1998; Mytilineou et al. , 2003). Extensive in vitro and animal data suggest that dopamine agonists may slow neuronal degeneration via both dopamine receptor mediated and non-dopamine recep- tor-mediated mechanisms (Olanow et al. , 1998; Schapira, 2002). Clinical studies based on this rationale are dis- cussed in detail later in this chapter. Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors, including selegiline, were initially considered potentially neuroprotective because of their antioxidant effects, but as already mentioned, recent pre- clinical data suggest that these drugs with a propargyline structure may have a more direct effect on slowing apop- tosis. The dopamine transporter (DAT), a recent target for symptomatic drugs for PD, is yet another target of potential neuroprotective medication. Studies show that DAT binding at the dopamine cell body may worsen neu- ronal degeneration (Blakely, 2001). Translation of neuroscience targets into potential drugs requires informative in vivo models of disease. Although there is no adequate animal model for progres- sive PD, two toxic models of dopaminergic neuronal loss, MPTP and 6OH dopamine, have been crucial in assess- ing potential PD drugs. The most important animal model for PD has been the MPTP model, providing a primate model of selective dopaminergic cell loss. MPTP administration, both in primates and in rodents, has been widely used to test potential neuroprotective drugs (Jenner, 2003; Wichmann and DeLong, 2003). Although recovery from the behavioral effects of MPTP is a reli- able predictor of symptomatic improvement in humans, it remains unclear whether recovery from an MPTP lesion will predict changes in PD progression. The loss of nigrostriatal neurons after treatment with 6OH dopamine in rats and the characteristic turning response after challenge with dopaminergic medications have also been widely used to understand mechanisms of dopaminergic cell death and potential interventions. The dopaminergic cell loss associated with rotenone, a com- mon pesticide, has provided an alternative toxic model and appears to mediate its effect via a mitochondrial mechanism (Perier et al. , 2003; Sherer et al. , 2003). Invertebrate models of PD have also been developed. For example, C. elegans has provided a model to assess dopaminergic toxicity (Nass et al. , 2002). More recently, characterization of the genetic abnormalities associated with familial PD has focused attention on the need for models of synuclein and parkin overexpression. Dr oso- phila models of synuclein and parkin mutations have been recently established and can be used to examine the pathologic consequences of these proteins (Feany and Bender, 2000; Greene et al. , 2003). Transgenic mice with a synuclein mutation have been developed and appear Prospects for Slowing the Progression of Parkinson’s Disease 143 Ch08.qxd 9/2/04 10:52 AM Page 143"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"to demonstrate pathological features of PD and trans- genics with impairment of the ubiquitin/proteasome sys- tem are also under study (Giasson et al. , 2002; Lindsten et al. , 2003). CLINICAL STUDIES OF PD PROGRESSION Many clinical studies have been designed to test drugs that may slow PD progression and/or restore neuronal function. In response to a recent request from the National Institutes of Health, 59 compounds were sug- gested by clinicians and researchers as possibly neuro- protective (Ravina et al. , 2003). Many more drugs are in early or preclinical development by the pharmaceutical industry. Although numerous candidate drugs exist, the most effective study design and clinical endpoints to eval- uate the effect of these drugs on disease progression remain uncertain. Several clinical endpoints have been used to assess progressive functional decline in PD. The most appropriate endpoint depends on the study ques- tion and in particular on the study population, the dura- tion of the study follow-up period, the potential symptomatic effect of the study drug, and the effect of concomitant medications. The most commonly used clin- ical endpoint has been the change during the study period in the widely used clinical scale, the Unified Parkinson disease rating scale (UPDRS) (Fahn et al. , 1987). Alternative clinical endpoints depend on the time to a disease milestone such as need for therapy, develop- ment of motor fluctuations, or a disabling feature of dis- ease such as falls, hallucinations or dementia, or change in UPDRS after a drug washout (Fahn, 1999; Parkinson Study Group, 1993, 2000a; Rascol et al. , 2000). Mixed endpoints combining disability scales and disease mile- stones have also been used (Shults et al. , 2002). More recently, quality of life (QOL) measures have been added to the assessment of disease progression, but there is no uniformly accepted PD QOL scale (Welsh et al. , 2003). Pharmacoeconomic measures have also been included to assess the impact of potential neuroprotection (Siderowf et al. , 2000). Caveats in Clinical Study Design Identifying a clinical endpoint that reliably reflects PD progression and that can be reasonably and practically used in clinical studies remains challenging. Clinical studies of potential disease-modifying drugs are limited by the slow progression and marked variability in pro- gression of the clinical features of PD. Variability in dis- ease progression is likely explained by both the typical individual variability among a population in any disease phenotype and, in particular, the v ariability in individuals’ ability to compensate, using as yet unknown mechanisms, for the loss of dopaminergic neurons. The variability among PD patients also may be explained if, as is likely, currently defined PD is really several related disease enti- ties with similar symptoms. The best current evidence that PD is really Parkinson syndromes are the several genetic parkinsonisms caused by recently identified dif- ferent mutations (Gasser, 2003). For example, recent studies of families with the parkin mutation and with Park 7 mutation suggest a slow progression compared to idiopathic PD (Dekker et al. , 2003; Khan et al. , 2002). The slow progression of PD presents the most difficult dilemma for clinical study design of neuroprotective PD drugs. The magnitude of the effect of a neuroprotective drug may be modest, but still clinically valuable. It is widely agreed among clinicians that a reduction in dis- ease progression of greater than 25% would clearly be clinically important. However, given the slow and varied progression of PD, it would require a large sample size and long duration (typically at least 18 months) of fol- low-up time to show a 25% neuroprotective effect (Marek et al. , 2003a). Typically during the study period, patients require initiation or modification of symptomatic med- ications to treat slowly worsening disability. The avail- ability of effective symptomatic therapy for PD is a blessing for patients, but the remarkable symptomatic benefit of these drugs creates a serious confound when using clinical symptoms and scales to assess disease pro- gression. For example the progressive disability of PD, as measured by the UPDRS, differs greatly at different study stages. In early untreated PD, the UPDRS scale increases at approximately 10 to 12 units/year in a linear manner (Parkinson Study Group, 1989, 1993, 2002a). It is generally possible to maintain a newly diagnosed PD patient without symptomatic medications for about 9 months (Parkinson Study Group, 1989, 2003). When dopaminergic treatment is initiated, the UPDRS is decreased by 8 to 13 units, and then once the patient has been treated, it is slowly increased by 1 to 2 units/year (Jankovic and Kapadia, 2001; Parkinson Study Group, 2000b). The symptomatic effect of commonly used drugs may overwhelm a more modest but ultimately more enduring protective effect. The confound from symptomatic medications is fur- ther complicated when the potential neuroprotective drug also has symptomatic effects (Parkinson Study Group, 1993). Several approaches have been used to overcome the potential confound of symptomatic treat- ment in assessing disease-modifying drugs. The simplest approaches are either to use endpoints that occur before symptomatic therapy, such as time to require initial treat- ment or to wash out the symptomatic drug at the end of the study, but this has proved difficult because of both practical clinical needs of patients and unexpectedly long 144 Prospects for Slowing the Progression of Parkinson’s Disease Ch08.qxd 9/2/04 10:52 AM Page 144"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"duration effects of medication (Hauser and Holford, 2002; Parkinson Study Group, 2003; Shults et al. , 2002; Whone et al. , 2002). Alternatively, endpoints indepen- dent of symptomatic benefit might be used, including those unaffected by the dopaminergic treatment (e.g., falls, dementia) (Kieburtz, 2003). Randomized start designs, in which both the placebo and treatment groups are eventually treated with the study drug but the dura- tion of treatment differs between groups, have also been suggested to mitigate any symptomatic effect of the study drug (Leber, 1997). THE ROLE OF BIOMARKERS IN STUDIES OF PD PROGRESSION The slow and variable clinical progression of PD, cou- pled with the confounding effects of ultimately necessary and effective symptomatic treatment, has fostered the development of more objective clinical tools to assess PD progression and therefore potential PD neuroprotective drugs. These tools are biomarkers for neurodegeneration and/or for clinical manifestations of PD. Biomarkers are broadly defined as characteristics that are objectively measured and evaluated as indicators of normal biologi- cal processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological responses to a therapeutic intervention (Biomarkers Definitions Working Group, 2001). Given the likely mul- tiple etiologies and pathological processes (e.g., protein aggregation, inflammation, oxidative stress) underlying neuronal degeneration in PD and the clear heterogeneity in the expression and progression of the clinical manifes- tations of PD, several biomarkers will likely be necessary to fully assess disease progression. Although biomarkers may be extraordinarily useful and new technologies very seductive, a number of caveats must be considered. First the performance characteristics of the marker must be established in the subject population under study. Second, the marker should be meaningful or relevant to the disease process. Third, it should be clear to what extent the marker is generalizable beyond a specific study population. Finally, the effect of factors such as age, medications, or environment on the biomarker must be clarified (DeKosky and Marek, 2003; Frank and Hargreaves, 2003). Current biomarkers for PD do not fully meet these criteria, and studies to further validate these markers are necessary (Brooks et al. , 2003a). Yet, even as identification and validation of these tools is ongoing, biomarkers have already played an important role in clinical studies of PD progression. Major motivations to use biomarkers in studies of PD progression are to shorten the study duration, reduce the study sample size and/or to provide information other- wise unavailable from clinical endpoints. Biomarkers for PD may be divided into four main categories: genetic, imaging, clinical, and biochemical. For example, genetic PD markers ultimately may be critical in clinical studies in selecting subjects and stratifying outcomes, providing information that cannot be obtained from clinical evalu- ation. Simple biochemical markers for PD degeneration are not yet available, but newer array-based technologies, including proteomics, transcriptomics , and meta bolomics, offer the promise to target biochemical deficits in PD more effectively to identify serum and CSF markers of disease. Currently, imaging biomarkers have emerged as the most mature and widely used tools to assess PD pro- gression and the effects of potential disease-modifying drugs in clinical studies. Imaging biomarkers provide a window to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and the potential to test the effects of drugs on the pro- gressive loss of dopamine neuron function longitudinally in a living PD patient (Brooks et al. , 2003a; Marek and Seibyl, 2000). Imaging Biomarkers During the past decade in vivo neuroreceptor imaging targeting nigral dopaminergic degeneration has been used to monitor onset, severity, and progression of PD. Recent advances in radiopharmaceutical development, imaging detector technologies, and image analysis soft- ware have expanded and accelerated the role of imaging in clinical research in PD in general, and neurotherapeu- tics for disease modifying drugs in particular. Several markers, most focused on the dopamine system, using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) technology have been used to assess PD. The most widely studied imaging biomarkers to assess PD progression have tar- geted presynaptic nigrostriatal function. Specifically, these ligands include PET/[18F]Dopa, which measures conversion of F-dopa to F-dopamine and therefore dopamine function; PET/[11C]VMAT2 (dihydrotetra- benazine), which tags the vesicular dopamine transporter; and several ligands including SPECT/[123I]B-CIT (2 β - carboxymethoxy-3 β (4-iodophenyl)tropane), [123I] FP- CIT, [123I] IPT, [99Tc]TR ODAT-1, and 18F-CFT, which bind to the DAT (Figure 8.2; see also the Color Plate sec- tion) (Asenbaum et al. , 1997; Booij et al. , 1998; Brooks et al. , 1990; Eidelberg et al. , 1995; Frey et al. , 1996; Innis et al. , 1993; Mozley et al. , 2000; Vingerhoets et al. , 1994). The properties of the radiopharmaceutical agent used to target the dopamine system is the most critical issue in developing a useful imaging tool for PD. Some of the key steps in development of a potential radioligand include assessment of the brain penetration of the radioligand, selectivity of the radioligand for the target site, binding properties of the radioligand to the site, and the meta bolic Prospects for Slowing the Progression of Parkinson’s Disease 145 Ch08.qxd 9/2/04 10:52 AM Page 145"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"fate of the radioligand. These properties help to deter- mine the signal/noise ratio of the ligand and the ease of quantitation of the imaging signal. The quantitation of the signal is essential to use these imaging markers as clinical research tools. Both PET (also called dual photon emission tomogra- phy) and SPECT are sensitive methods of measuring in vivo neurochemistry (Lassen and Holm, 1992; Phelps, 1992). The choice of imaging modality is ultimately determined by the specific study questions and study design. Although in general PET cameras have better res- olution than SPECT cameras, SPECT studies may be technologically and clinically more feasible, particularly for the large clinical studies requiring rapid patient accrual and necessary to assess PD progression. PET studies may benefit from greater flexibility in the range of radiopharmaceuticals that can be tested, but SPECT studies have the advantage of longer half-life radiophar- maceuticals necessary for some studies. Dopamine ligands are useful to assess PD insofar as they reflect the ongoing dopaminergic degeneration in PD. In the study most directly correlating changes in dopamine neuronal numbers and imaging outcomes, there is good correlation between dopamine neuron loss and [18F]DOPA uptake, although conclusions are lim- ited by a very small sample size of only five subjects (Snow et al. , 1993). Numerous other studies have shown that the DAT is reduced in striatum in postmortem brain from PD patients (Kaufman and Madras, 1991; Niznik et al. , 1991; Wilson et al. , 1996). In turn, numerous clini- cal imaging studies have shown reductions in [18F]DOPA and [C11]VMAT2 and DAT ligands uptake in PD patients and aging healthy subjects consistent with the expected pathology of PD and of normal aging. Specifically, these imaging studies show asymmetrical, putamen>caudate loss of dopaminergic uptake, and the imaging loss correlates with worsening clinical symptoms in cross-sectional evaluation (Booij et al. , 1997; Fischman et al. , 1998; Frey et al. , 1996; Huang et al. , 2001; Sawle et al. , 1994; Seibyl et al. , 1995). In addition DAT ligands show reductions in activity with normal aging (Mozley et al. , 1999; van Dyck et al. , 2002; Volkow et al. , 1994). Monitoring PD Progression In several studies, neuroreceptor imaging of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system has been further developed as a research tool to monitor progressive dopaminergic neuron loss in PD. In longitudinal studies of PD progression [18F]DOPA, [11C]VMAT2, and dopamine transporter imaging ( β -CIT and CFT) using both PET and SPECT have shown an annualized rate of reduction in striatal [18F]DOPA, [11C]VMAT2, [18F]CFT, or [123I] β -CIT uptake of about 4% to 13% in PD patients compared with 0% to 2.5% change in healthy control subjects (Brooks et al. , 2003b; Marek et al. , 2001; 146 Prospects for Slowing the Progression of Parkinson’s Disease FIGURE 8.2 Dopamine synapse showing the presynaptic dopamine imaging targets (Marek and Seibyl, 2000). (See also the Color Plate section.) Ch08.qxd 9/2/04 10:52 AM Page 146"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Morrish et al. , 1998; Nurmi et al. , 2000b, 2001; Pirker et al. , 2002). Evidence from studies of hemi-PD subjects provides further insight into the rate of progression of disease. In early hemi-PD there is a reduction in [18F]DOPA, [C11]VMAT2, and DAT uptake of about 50% in the affected putamen and of 25% to 30% in the unaffected putamen. As most patients will progress clin- ically from unilateral to bilateral in 3 to 6 years, it is likely that the loss of these in vivo imaging markers of dopaminergic degeneration in the previously unaffected putamen will progress at about 5% to 10% per year (Booij et al. , 1998; Guttman et al. , 1997; Marek et al. , 1996; Sawle et al. , 1994). Imaging studies assessing progression of disease have provided data to estimate sample sizes required to detect slowing of disease progression resulting from study drug treatment. The sample size required depends on the effect size of the disease-modifying drug and the dura- tion of exposure to the drug. The effect of the drug is generally expressed as the percent reduction in rate of loss of the imaging marker in the group treated with the study drug vs a comparison or control group. More specifically, imaging studies have sought a reduction of between 25% and 50% in the rate of loss of [18F]DOPA, [C11]VMAT2, or [123I] β -CIT uptake (i.e., a reduction from 10% per year to 5% to 7.5% per year). The sample size needed to detect a 25% to 50% reduction in the rate of loss of F-dopa or β -CIT uptake during a 24-month interval ranges from approximately 30 to 150 research subjects in each study arm (Brooks et al. , 2003b). These estimates may be influenced substantially by the stage of PD and other symptomatic medications allowed in the study. These data and the sample size estimates support the use of dopamine neuroreceptor imaging to assess the effects of potential neuroprotective drugs in PD, but there are several limitations in the study design and inter- pretation of these studies. 1. Imaging outcomes in studies of PD patients are bio- markers for brain activity, but are not true surrogates for drug effects or clinical outcomes in PD patients (De Gruttola et al. , 2001). Although numerous cross-sec- tional studies have shown a clear correlation between imaging measures such as [123I] β -CIT and [18F]Dopa and clinical outcomes such as the UPDRS, longitudi- nal studies have shown only minimal correlation at best between the change in imaging outcomes and the change in clinical outcomes (Brooks et al. , 2003b; Marek et al. , 2001; Morrish et al. , 1996). There are sev- eral explanations for the lack of correlation between [123I] β -CIT or [18F]DOPA uptake and UPDRS in longitudinal studies. First, the UPDRS is confounded by the effects of the patient’s anti-Parkinson medica- tions, both acutely after initiating therapy and with ongoing treatment. Even evaluation of the UPDRS in the “defined off ” state (12 hours after last medication) or after prolonged washout does not eliminate the long duration symptomatic effects of these treatments (Hauser and Holford, 2002; Nutt and Holford, 1996). Second, the temporal patterns for rate of loss of DAT and the change in UPDRS may not be congruent. This is best illustrated in early PD by data demonstrating a loss of approximately 40% to 60% of striatal [123I] β - CIT or [18F]DOPA uptake at the time of diagnosis when clinical symptoms measured by the UPDRS may be minimal. This preclinical period is estimated to last 3 to 12 years based on back-extrapolating imaging data to calculate the time interval between start of dopamine degeneration and start of symptoms (Marek, 1999; Morrish et al. , 1996). Later in the dis- ease course, after treatment with dopaminergic drugs, the UPDRS changes very slowly, 1.34/year in the “on” and 1.58/year in the “off ” state in a recent report from a large clinic, differing from the 10 point/year change in untreated patients (Jankovic and Kapadia, 2001; Parkinson Study Group, 1989, 2002a). This slow change in UPDRS during the treatment phase of PD reflects treatment to mitigate disability, but imaging during this period shows the expected continued loss of [123I] β -CIT or [18F]DOPA uptake, again indicating that clinical and imaging outcomes provide comple- mentary, but not necessarily correlative, data. Third, the UPDRS is a measure of dopaminergic and non- dopaminergic symptoms and is vulnerable to both patient and evaluator subjectivity. Fourth, both imag- ing outcomes and UPDRS may not progress linearly. Evidence from longitudinal imaging studies suggests a relatively linear progression for the initial 5 years after diagnosis, but that later in disease the rate of loss of [123I] β -CIT uptake may slow (Jennings et al. , 2000; Pirker et al. , 2000). 2. Like clinical outcomes, imaging outcomes of disease progression may be confounded by pharmacological effects of dopaminergic drugs used to treat PD symp- toms and/or by other study drugs. Although most pre- clinical studies evaluating the regulation of imaging outcomes by dopamine agonists and antagonists and levodopa have not shown a consistent effect of these drugs, some studies have shown modulation of the DAT, the vesicular transporter, and dopamine turnover (Gnanalingham and Robertson, 1994; Moody et al. , 1996; Truong et al. , 2003; Vander Borght et al. , 1995; Zigmond et al. , 1990). These data raise concerns, although the relevance of these preclinical studies to human imaging studies is questionable because of the brief exposure time to drugs, suprapharmacological dosing, and species differences. In one of the few clinical Prospects for Slowing the Progression of Parkinson’s Disease 147 Ch08.qxd 9/2/04 10:52 AM Page 147"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"studies comparing imaging ligands within subjects, 35 PD patients and 16 age-matched control subjects imaged with [11C]methylphenidate (a dopamine trans- porter ligand), [18F]Dopa, and [11C]VMAT2 showed reduction in DAT > vesicular transporter > F-dopa uptake. These data suggest that differential regulation of these imaging targets might occur in a progressively denervated striatum (Lee et al. , 2000). Other studies have more directly assessed the potential short-term regulation of imaging ligands by common PD medica- tions. In the CALM-PD CIT study (detailed later), there was no significant change in β -CIT uptake after 10 weeks of treatment with either pramipexole (dosage 1.5 to 4.5 mg) or levodopa (dose 300 to 600 mg), con- sistent with previous studies evaluating levodopa effects after 6 to 12 weeks (Innis et al. , 1999; Nurmi et al. , 2000a; Parkinson Study Group, 2002b). In a similar study, treatment with pergolide for 6 weeks also showed no significant changes in [123I] β -CIT striatal, putamen, or caudate uptake, but an insignificant trend toward increased [ 123 I] β -CIT uptake (Ahlskog et al. , 1999). Data assessing RTI-32, another dopamine transporter ligand, demonstrated significant reductions from base- line in striatal DAT after 6 weeks of treatment with both levodopa and pramipexole, but also with placebo, and this pilot study could not detect differences between the treatment and placebo (Guttman et al. , 2001). There was no effect on [18F]Dopa uptake in a study of 5 patients with restless legs syndrome who had been treated with levodopa (Turjanski et al. , 1999). Although these clinical studies do not demonstrate sig- nificant regulation of the dopamine transporter or [18F]Dopa uptake, they do not exclude a significant short-term treatment-induced change in imaging out- comes, nor do they address the possibility that pharma- cological effects may emerge in longer term studies. 3. The rate of change in imaging outcomes used to measure disease progression is very slow, reflecting the slow clinical progression in PD requiring the duration of these progression studies to be at least 18 to 24 months. Furthermore, it is crucial to assess whether changes in loss of imaging outcomes are enduring and whether they are ultimately associated with slowing of clinical outcomes. Therefore the study design should include the potential for continued follow-up evalua- tion to monitor long-term changes in disease progres- sion in the study cohort. 4. Progressive loss in brain DAT imaging activity also occurs in aging healthy individuals, consistent with pathology, although at a rate approximately one tenth that of PD patients (Marek et al. , 2001). No change in F-Dopa uptake with aging has been shown, consistent with the presumed up regulation of dopamine turnover in normal aging (Morrish et al. , 1996). CLINICAL STUDIES OF NEUROPROTECTION IN PD Despite the difficulties in developing clinical outcome measures and the limits of imaging as a biomarker, sev- eral clinical studies have been completed or are underway to assess potentially neuroprotective drugs in PD. Although no drug has been established as neuroprotec- tive, these studies have provided important data and incremental experience in using clinical and imaging out- comes. These studies, several of which are detailed next, have educated investigators and informed clinical study design so that clinical studies are increasingly more likely to convincingly demonstrate meaningful neuroprotection. DATATOP The DATATOP study pioneered clinical study design to assess neuroprotective drugs. In this study 800 subjects with early untreated PD were randomized to treatment with either or both selegiline and tocopherol. The study was prompted by basic science evidence suggesting that these drugs might slow neurodegeneration by reducing oxidative neuronal stress. The study used a novel clinical endpoint, the time to need for levodopa, as a practical and easily definable clinical measure of disease progres- sion. Results from this study and other similarly designed smaller studies showed that selegline treatment signifi- cantly delayed the time to need for levodopa compared to placebo treatment; tocopherol had no effect (Parkinson Study Group, 1989; Tetrud and Langston, 1989). However, the data also showed that selegiline had a small but significant beneficial effect on PD symptoms as measured by the UPDRS and that this improvement lasted longer than the 1-month washout used in this study (Parkinson Study Group, 1993). Therefore, although the study clearly showed that selegline was effective in slowing disease progression as measured by the primary clinical outcome, selegiline’s symptomatic effect on PD created a confound that could fully explain this effect. The results of the DATATOP study remain controver- sial. Subsequent analyses and studies have suggested that there may be both a symptomatic and protective effect of selegiline (Langston and Tanner, 2000; Larsen et al. , 1999; Shoulson et al. , 2002). Further preclinical studies have suggested that selegiline may exert neuroprotective benefit through its effects on the apoptotic pathway and not as an antioxidant (Maruyama et al. , 2002; Tatton et al. , 2002). However, the symptomatic confound noted in the DATATOP study remains unchallenged, and the extent of any possible neuroprotective effect of selegiline is uncertain. Although the DATATOP study did not demonstrate neuroprotection of either selegline or tocopherol, it was 148 Prospects for Slowing the Progression of Parkinson’s Disease Ch08.qxd 9/2/04 10:52 AM Page 148"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"a critical step in the study design of neuroprotective clin- ical studies for PD (Shoulson, 1998a). It established need for levodopa as an important clinical endpoint, devel- oped a consortium of clinical centers able to recruit and study 800 research subjects, and provided crucial data on the progression of disease of a large cohort of early PD subjects. Data from the DATATOP study have been cru- cial in establishing the progression of PD symptoms in an untreated placebo group and the duration that an early PD placebo group can remain untreated with symp- tomatic medication, both important in estimating sample size for further studies. The DATATOP study also high- lighted the importance of developing clinical studies that could distinguish between a small symptomatic effect and a neuroprotective effect. Dopamine Agonist/Levodopa Studies Several similar clinical studies have compared the effect of treatment with the dopamine agonists, pramipexole (CALM-PD), ropinirole (056 Study), caber- goline, and pergolide (PELMOPET) to treatment with levodopa on PD progression (Parkinson Study Group, 2000b; Rascol et al. , 2000; Rinne et al. , 1998). These clin- ical studies have been designed to examine the policy of initial treatment with dopamine agonists vs levodopa in early PD patients during a 2- to 5-year period, with the primary clinical endpoint being the development in motor fluctuations. Motor fluctuations, when patients experience periods of relatively poor function resulting from slow movements often cycling with involuntary abnormal movements, generally occur in PD patients after treatment with dopaminergic therapies. Fluctuations consist of “wearing off ” of medication, abnormal invol- untary movements called dyskinesias, and on-off phe- nomena (very rapid cycling between off and functional periods). Although it is unclear whether motor fluctua- tions reflect progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, it is certain that development of motor fluctuations is an important clinical milestone of disease progression. The primary clinical data in these studies demonstrated that pramipexole, ropinirole, cabergoline, or pergolide delayed the onset of dopaminergic motor complications, particu- larly dyskinesia, compared with levodopa therapy, but that initial levodopa therapy was more effective than the dopamine agonist in ameliorating signs and symptoms of PD as measured by the UPDRS. In parallel with these clinical outcomes, in vivo imag- ing using either [123I] β -CIT/SPECT or [18F]Dopa/PET has been used to compare the pr ogressive loss of dopa- minergic neurons in early PD patients initially treated with either dopamine agonists or levodopa. Initial results from studies comparing pramipexole (CALM-PD CIT), ropinirole (056), or pergolide (PELMOPET) to levodopa showed nonsignificant trends for a reduction in the loss of [123I] β -CIT uptake (pramipexole) and [18F]Dopa uptake (ropinirole and pergolide) compared to levodopa treatment (Parkinson Study Group, 2000b). Based on these studies, the blinded imaging assessments in the pramipexole (CALM-PD CIT) study were extended to 46 months, and a second ropinirole study focused on neu- roimaging was initiated called the REAL-PET study (Parkinson Study Group, 2002b; Whone et al. , 2002). In CALM-PD CIT, a parallel-group, double-blind randomized study conducted by the Parkinson Study Group and sponsored by The Pharmacia Corp. and Boehringer-Ingelheim, 82 PD patients enrolled in the CALM-PD study were imaged with β -CIT/SPECT at baseline and again 22 (n = 78), 34 (n = 71), and 46 (n = 65) months after initial treatment. Patients were ran- domly assigned to receive pramipexole 0.5 mg three times per day (n = 42) or levodopa 100 mg three times per day (n = 40). For patients with residual disability, the dosage was escalated up to 1.5 mg pramipaxole or 200 mg levodopa three times daily during the first 10 weeks and subsequently open label levodopa could be added. After 24 months of follow-up evaluation, the dosage of study drug could be further modified. The primary outcome variable was the percent change from baseline in striatal [123I] β -CIT uptake after 46 months. Comparison of the treatment groups in CALM-PD CIT showed that the percent loss in striatal [123I] β -CIT uptake from baseline was significantly reduced in the group initially treated with pramipexole compared to the group initially treated with levodopa at each time point: − 7.1 ± 9.0% vs − 13.5 ± 9.6% at 22 months, P = .004; − 10.9 ± 11.8% vs − 19.6 ± 12.4% at 34 months, P = .009; and − 16.0 ± 13.3% vs − 25.5 ± 14.1% at 46 months, P = .01. Approximately 75% of those subjects initially treated with pramipexole alone were also treated with supplemental levodopa by 46 months after baseline. Analysis of the putamen and caudate data separately was similar to the combined stri- atal region of interest (Parkinson Study Group, 2002b). In the REAL-PET study, sponsored by GlaxoSmith- Kline, 186 denovo PD patients were treated in a random- ized, double-blinded multicenter design with either ropinirole or levodopa and imaged with [18F]dopa on study drug and 24 months after initial treatment. Patients were randomized in equal numbers to each treatment group. The mean daily doses after 2 years were 12.2 ± 6.2 mg ropinirole and 558.7 ± 180.8 mg levodopa. Supple- mental levodopa could be added to subjects with insuffi- cient therapeutic benefit from study drug during the study. The primary outcome variable was the percent change from baseline in the putamen [18F]Dopa uptake. Note that baseline imaging was on study drug, but the dose was increased during the 24-month study period. Comparison of the treatment groups showed that the Prospects for Slowing the Progression of Parkinson’s Disease 149 Ch08.qxd 9/2/04 10:52 AM Page 149"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"percent loss from baseline in putamen [18F]Dopa in the ropinirole group was significantly reduced compared with the levodopa group: − 13% vs − 20%, P = .022. An alternative analysis of these data using statistical para- metric mapping, a technique designed to take advantage of the brain imaging data in all brain regions, similarly showed reduction in loss of activity in putamen in the ropinirole vs levodopa groups: − 14% vs − 20%, P = .034 (Whone et al. , 2002). These two clinical imaging studies targeting dopamine function with different imaging ligands and technology both demonstrate slowing in the rate of loss of [123I] β - CIT or [18F]Dopa uptake, in early PD patients treated with dopamine agonists compared to levodopa. These studies evaluated two related, predominantly D2 dopamine receptor agonists, suggesting that the results may indicate a class effect. The relative reduction in the percent loss from baseline of [123I] β -CIT uptake in the pramipexole vs the levodopa group was 47% at 22 months, 44% at 34 months, and 37% at 46 months after initiating treatment. The relative reduction of [18F]Dopa uptake in the ropinirole group vs the levodopa group was 35% at 24 months. These data suggest that treatment with the dopamine agonists, pramipexole and ropinirole, and/or with levodopa may either slow or accelerate the dopaminergic degeneration of PD. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate that in vivo imaging can be used to assess potential disease-modifying drugs in well-con- trolled, blinded clinical studies. Although both the CALM-PD CIT and the REAL- PET demonstrate a robust and remarkably consistent reduction in imaging uptake in the dopamine agonist vs levodopa groups, several issues in the study design limit interpretation of these data regarding neuroprotection. Lack of Placebo Both studies compared two active medications with- out a placebo group. Therefore, these data cannot directly distinguish whether the difference in the rate of loss of [123I] β -CIT or [18F]Dopa uptake in the treat- ment groups results from a reduction due to pramipexole or ropinirole, an increase due to levodopa, or both. Long-term data from the CALM-PD CIT study may be consistent with levodopa toxicity. In the CALM-PD CIT study, the percent reduction of striatal [123I] β -CIT uptake from baseline in the pramipexole vs levodopa groups differs significantly at 22, 34, and 46 months; however, the difference in the rate of change between the two groups is significant between baseline and 22 months, but not 22 to 46 months. This finding may be explained by the increasing percentage of subjects ini- tially treated with pramipexole who are supplemented with levodopa with disease progression (75% by month 46), possibly blunting the pramipexole effect evident at 22 months (Parkinson Study Group, 2002b). Possible Regulation of Imaging Outcomes Another possible explanation for the difference in the loss of [123I] β -CIT and [18F]Dopa uptake in the dopamine agonist vs levodopa groups in these studies is that results were due to a pharmacological interaction between pramipexole or ropinirole, levodopa, or both and the DAT or dopamine turnover, rather than slowed or accelerated neuron degeneration (Ahlskog, 2003; Albin and Frey, 2003; Wooten, 2003). These concerns highlight the need to further investigate the effect of short-term treatment with dopamine agonists and lev- odopa on dopamine imaging outcomes with a well-pow- ered study. While the possibility of pharmacological regulation remains, this explanation must account for the data from both the CALM-PD CIT and REAL-PET studies. Clinical Imaging Correlation In the CALM-PD CIT and REAL-PET studies, there was no correlation between the percent change from baseline in the imaging outcome and the change from baseline in UPDRS at 22 to 24 months. However, the loss of striatal [123I] β -CIT uptake from baseline was signifi- cantly correlated (r = − 0.40, P = .001) with the change in UPDRS from baseline at the 46-month evaluation, sug- gesting that the correlation between clinical and imaging outcomes begins to emerge with longer monitoring. These data underscore that particularly in early PD, clin- ical and imaging outcomes provide complementary data and that long-term follow-up will be required to correlate changes in clinical and imaging outcomes. Slowing the loss of imaging outcomes in PD is relevant only if these imaging changes ultimately result in meaningful, measur- able, and persistent changes in clinical function in PD patients. ELLDOPA Study The ELLDOPA (Earlier vs Later L -DOPA Therapy in Parkinson Disease ) study compared treatment of early untreated PD patients with carbidopa/levodopa (37.5 mg/150 mg, 75 mg/300 mg, or 150 mg/600 mg) or placebo for 40 weeks (Fahn, 1999). Several preclinical studies have indicated that levodopa may be toxic to dopaminer- gic neurons in vitro, whereas other studies have not shown any toxicity in animals, even in the presence of oxidative 150 Prospects for Slowing the Progression of Parkinson’s Disease Ch08.qxd 9/2/04 10:52 AM Page 150"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"stress (Fahn, 1999; Mytilineou et al. , 2003). Moreover, other studies have suggested that levodopa may protect against antiapoptotic proteins or may be trophic and potentially promote functional recovery of damaged nigral neurons (Datla et al. , 2001; Murer et al. , 1998). The goal of the ELLDOPA study w as to examine whether lev- odopa therapy influences the rate of progression of PD using both clinical and imaging outcomes. The study is especially clinically relevant, as carbidopa/ levodopa remains the mainstay of symptomatic therapy for PD. In ELLDOPA, 361 subjects were recruited and ran- domized to the four treatment arms. After 40 weeks of treatment, the study drug was discontinued and patients were evaluated 1 and 2 weeks later. The primary outcome was the change in UPDRS between baseline and the 2- week washout period (42 weeks). All doses of levodopa produced clinical benefit compared with placebo throughout the study and after discontinuing treatment for 2 weeks. Changes of UPDRS scores between baseline and 2 weeks after withdrawal of active treatment were less severe than in the placebo group (change of 7.8 ± 9.0, 1.9 ± 6.0, 1.9 ± 6.9, and − 1.4 ± 7.7 for placebo, 150 mg/day, 300 mg/day, and 600 mg/day, respectively, P > .0001) (Parkinson Study Group, 2003). A subset of the ELLDOPA subjects (N = 135) under- went [123I] β -CIT imaging at baseline and after 40 weeks to assess the effect of levodopa on dopaminergic function as measured by this imaging biomarker. Comparison of the treatment groups in ELLDOPA showed that the percent loss in striatal [123I] β -CIT uptake from baseline was reduced in the groups treated with levodopa compared to placebo, but this reduction was not statistically significant. However, 19 of the 135 subjects (14%) enrolled in the imaging substudy had both baseline and 40-week [123I] β -CIT scans with β -CIT uptake > 75% age-expected putaminal uptake (Marek et al. , 2003b). These scans without dopaminergic deficit (SWEDD) suggest these subjects are unlikely to have PD. Similar scans in the “normal” range were reported in the REAL-PET study in 11% of enrolled subjects (Whone et al. , 2002). Analysis of the [123I] β -CIT SPECT results excluding the subjects with SWEDDs (N = 116) showed a statistically greater decrease in [123I] β -CIT uptake in the levodopa ( − 6 ± 10.3%, − 4 ± 9.4%, − 7.2 ± 7.6%, for 150 mg/days, 300 mg/days, and 600 mg/days, respectively) than in the placebo group ( − 1.4 ± 10.0%), P = .036 for a dose response (Parkinson Study Group, 2003). The ELLDOPA study, like all clinical neuroprotection studies to date, has not provided definitive answers, has raised many critical questions, and has taught us many important lessons. The clinical outcome in the ELLDOPA study, the persistent and dose-related improvement in UPDRS after a 2-week washout of levodopa, suggests two potential explanations. First, levodopa may be neuropro- tective, slowing the loss of disability in PD as measured by the UPDRS even after its symptomatic effect is elimi- nated. Second, the 2-week washout of levodopa was too short to fully eliminate a symptomatic effect of levodopa. This study cannot differentiate between these possibilities. The ELLDOPA study has shown that while a 2-week washout of a powerful symptomatic drug such as lev- odopa is possible, it is unlikely to distinguish between a lin- gering symptomatic and an ongoing neuroprotective effect. In the future, study designs such as randomized start designs, which reduce reliance on a washout period, will be used in neuroprotective studies. The imaging outcome from the ELLDOPA study has also raised several questions. The increased loss of [123I] β -CIT uptake in the levodopa treated groups sug- gests that levodopa may accelerate the loss of dopamine neurons, despite its remarkable symptomatic effect in PD. These results are consistent with the imaging results in the CALM-PD and REAL-PET studies, all suggesting that levodopa treatment may accelerate the loss of imag- ing markers of dopamine neuronal function in compari- son to either placebo or dopamine agonists (Figure 8.3). An alternative explanation for these imaging results, however, is that the change in [123I] β -CIT uptake in the levodopa, dopamine agonist, and placebo-treated groups may be due to a direct regulatory effect of these drugs on the DAT or dopamine turnover without any change in neuronal degeneration. As detailed previously, the stud- ies that have addressed this question are inconclusive because of small sample size. The ELLDOPA study now coupled with the dopamine agonist studies has provided a powerful rationale to initiate well-powered clinical imaging studies with sufficient sample size to answer the crucial question as to whether the study drug-related dif- ference in imaging outcomes in these studies is explained by a short-term regulatory effect in DAT and F-DOPA imaging or whether it reflects differential progressive loss of dopaminergic function. Coenzyme Q10 Study In the coenzyme Q10 study, known as QE-2, early untreated PD patients were treated with either coenzyme Q10 at doses of 300, 600, or 1200 mg/day or placebo for up to 16 months (Shults et al. , 2002). Numerous studies have demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction in PD patients with a clear deficit in complex I (Beal, 2003; Greenamyre et al. , 2001; Schapira et al. , 1998). It remains uncertain whether this mitochondrial dysfunction results from and/or contributes to the neuronal cell loss of PD. Coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone) serves as the electron acceptor for complexes I and II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and also acts as an antioxidant. Several preclinical studies have suggested that coenzyme Prospects for Slowing the Progression of Parkinson’s Disease 151 Ch08.qxd 9/2/04 10:52 AM Page 151"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Q10 might improve mitochondrial function and therefore might reduce the vulnerability of dopamine neurons (Shults, 2003). In addition, a large study assessing the effect of coenzyme Q10 in Huntington disease has shown a trend for reduction in the rate of clinical deterioration (Huntington Study Group, 2001). In QE-2, 80 subjects were recruited and randomized to the four treatment arms and treated for 16 months or until they required treatment with levodopa. The primary outcome, a novel clinical measure known as the Oakes design, was the change in UPDRS between baseline and the last visit, thereby combining the change in UPDRS, a continuous measure of progressive disability, with need for levodopa, a disease milestone. The adjusted mean total UPDRS changes were + 11.99 for the placebo group, + 8.81, + 10.82, + 6.69 for the 300 mg/day, 600 mg/day, and 1200 mg/day group. The change in UPDRS was signifi- cantly greater in the placebo group than in the 1200mg/day group, P = .04, and there was a trend for a dose response among the groups, P = .09 (Shults et al. , 2002). The QE-2 study used a novel combination clinical endpoint to assess neuroprotection. The study results are provocative, but the sample size of this Phase II study does not allow definitive conclusions. Even in this study of a nondopaminergic drug, the data raise the question of a potential symptomatic rather than neuroprotective effect of coenzyme Q10. The possibility of an unexpected symptomatic effect of coenzyme Q10 is suggested by the short-term improvement (after 1 month) in treated patients in clinical scales reflecting activities of daily liv- ing. A larger more definitive study of the effect of high doses of coenzyme Q10 on the progressive disability of PD is planned to address this question. NEUROPROTECTION IN PD: LESSONS LEARNED Slowing the progression of PD remains a crucial unmet need for PD patients and their families (Ravina et al. , 2003; Shoulson, 1998b). During the past 15 years, beginning with the pioneering DATATOP study, several clinical studies (some detailed previously) have been con- ducted in an attempt to demonstrate neuroprotection in PD. Although none of these studies have as yet proven that any study drug modifies PD progression, they have provided a crucial evolving understanding of how to assess potentially neuroprotective medications. Fueled by an increasing number of biochemical targets and an ever- present human need to solve this problem, new studies of neuroprotective drugs are underway and continue to develop (Table 8.1). The lessons learned from prior clini- cal studies, some listed later, must be applied to these newer studies to optimize their potential success. 1. Reduce expectations: Clinical studies and clinical out- comes are an imperfect compromise between the nec- essary scientific rigor of clinical trials and the clinical needs of the participating subjects. It is unlikely that a single study will prove that a drug is neuroprotective. Rather a cumulative body of evidence from several pre- clinical and clinical studies will be required. Therefore, clinical studies should focus on achievable outcomes such as whether there is slowing of clinical disability or reduction in the loss of a relevant biomarker. 2. Expect surprises : Clinical studies of PD neuropro- tection have consistently demonstrated surprising results. The most frequent unexpected result has been a previously unrecognized or underestimated sympto- matic effect of study drugs obscuring a potential protective effect. For example, the long-lasting symp- tomatic effect of selegiline in the DATATOP study was not expected based on data from smaller stud- ies. Similarly the short-term improvement in activi- ties of daily living scales in patients treated with coenyzme Q10 was unexpected and has confused the results. In the ELLDOPA study, the marked improve- ment in UPDRS after a 2-week washout has raised the possibility of a pr eviously unrecognized long- lasting effect of levodopa vs a surprisingly prominent neuroprotective effect. New study designs must identify and/or control for potential symptomatic effects. Studies should be ade- quately powered to identify small symptomatic effects of the study drug. Studies should also be powered to detect potential confounding effects of the study drug on biomarkers such as imaging outcomes used in the study. Washout periods should be long enough to elim- inate lingering symptomatic effects or, if this is not 152 Prospects for Slowing the Progression of Parkinson’s Disease 10 0 01020 Scan Interval (mo) 30 40 50 − 10 − 20 − 30 − 40 CALM-Pramipexole CALM Levodopa ELLDOPA Placebo ELLDOPA 150 ELLDOPA 300 ELLDOPA 600 FIGURE 8.3 Percent loss of [123I] β -CIT uptake from baseline in the CALM-PD CIT and ELLDOPA CIT.

Ch08.qxd 9/2/04 10:52 AM Page 152"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"practically possible, should be discarded in favor of other study designs. Designs such as randomized start studies in which all subjects are ultimately treated with study drug may minimize any symptomatic effect of the study drug in the treatment groups. For example, a recent report of the TEMPO study, evaluating the symptomatic effect of rasagiline in early PD patients, showed that the magnitude of UPDRS improvement in rasagiline-treated patients after 1 year was greater in those treated at study start than after 6 months on placebo, suggesting that the improvement in UPDRS is not explained as solely a symptomatic benefit, but possibly a disease-modifying effect. While this study was not designed as a randomized start, it provides clues and points out the challenges of using this type of study design to assess disease progression when a symptomatic effect is also present. Another study strat- egy to reduce the importance of any relatively short- term symptomatic effects is a large simple trial design to assess long-term effects of study drugs on disease progression in a real-life setting using long-term outcomes such as institutionalization or mortality. 3. Understand the disease: The study design depends on the disease stage, clinical needs of the patient popula- tion, medications allowed, and duration of follow-up period. One simple approach to disease stage is to divide PD patients into untreated patients, treated with stable response to treatment, treated with a fluc- tuating response to treatment, and end-stage patients without an effective treatment effect. The rate of dis- ease progression may depend on disease stage, with relative slowing of disease progression as PD contin- ues (Jennings et al. , 2000). Although studying early untreated subjects focuses on patients with the most neuronal reserve remaining and avoids confounding concomitant medications, it may limit the duration of the study, as most subjects will require symptomatic medication within 12 months (Parkinson Study Group, 1989, 2002a). The randomized start approach may enable early-stage patients to remain in the study even after treatment. Another approach has been to study patients who are treated with stable response to treatment. Addition of study drug to these patients already treated may be useful if these subjects remain on the same symptomatic medication throughout the study or if change in medication is a clinical outcome. Yet another critical practical concern is that treated patients are much easier to identify and recruit into clinical studies than early untreated patients. Clinical studies are often a compromise between the most comprehensive study and the most practical study. Even in a very practical study, however, both the sample size and study duration must be sufficient to answer the study question. In PD, the slow and variable course of disease progression tends to increase the necessary sample size and prolong the study dura- tion. In a recent example of an underpowered and short duration study, the effect of the neuroimmunophilin ligand (NILA) on PD progression was assessed after only 6 months and the results were equivocal (Seibyl et al. , 2002). This has resulted in a second study of 2-years duration to answer this question. 4. Understand the use of biomarkers: Although biomark- ers, in particular imaging markers, have provided important results in neuroprotection studies, they must be used with caution. Biomarkers may be spe- cific to study stage and/or confounded by study med- ication or symptomatic medications. In addition, recent studies using imaging biomarkers have also clearly demonstrated that there may be a poor corre- lation between imaging and clinical measures of dis- ease progression, especially in short-term studies allowing symptomatic treatment. Biomarkers and clinical outcomes provide complementary information regarding disease progression, but not necessarily cor- relative information in disease progression studies. 5. Increase expectations: Neuroprotection must be clini- cally meaningful and clinical endpoints must clearly address the major causes of long-term disability of PD. In addition to slowing of motor symptoms, stud- ies should focus on slowing cognitive loss, gait and balance disturbance, and autonomic symptoms. These studies will likely require patients with moderate to later stage disease and prolonged follow-up time. Delaying or preventing these disease milestones would provide unequivocal evidence of meaningful disease modification. Therefore studies to show neuroprotection must include assessment of subjects at various clinical stages of disease, slowing of both motor and nonmotor clinical disability, and evidence of slowing of dopamine degener- ation. It is likely that neuroprotection studies will require two phases, the first in early PD subjects to demonstrate slowed worsening in accepted clinical scales and slowed loss of a biomarker of neurodegeneration and the sec- ond in later PD subjects to show meaningful delay of milestones of PD disability. NEUROPROTECTION IN PD: FUTURE PROSPECTS The goal of neuroprotective therapy is to provide treat- ment for PD patients as early as possible after the start of neurodegeneration. Like many other neurodegenerative disorders, PD is characterized by a prolonged preclinical period during which dopamine neurons are degenerating, Prospects for Slowing the Progression of Parkinson’s Disease 153 Ch08.qxd 9/2/04 10:52 AM Page 153"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"but symptoms have not yet begun (Figure 8.1). This pre- clinical period, likely lasting years, provides an opportu- nity to initiate early therapy and to protect neurons. However, neuroprotective treatments can be initiated only if tools are available to accurately identify subjects either at risk for dopamine degeneration and/or who are already experiencing preclinical dopaminergic degeneration. Studies assessing family members of PD patients as an at- risk group have demonstrated neuronal loss in unaffected family members (Figure 8.4; see also the Color Plate sec- tion), but the relative contribution of genetics in sporadic PD has been questioned in recent twin studies and in epi- demiological surveys (Elbaz et al. , 2003; Marder et al. , 2003; Piccini et al. , 1997, 1999; Tanner et al. , 1999). Studies to develop and validate screening tools for PD will be crucial to the early use of neuroprotective drugs. Prospects for neuroprotective therapy in PD continue to expand. The studies to date have provided exciting results, but also notes of caution regarding the difficul- ties in clearly demonstrating neuroprotection. Ultimately it may be necessary to combine drugs to develop a neu- roprotective cocktail for PD patients or to tailor drugs for subsets of PD patients, Nonetheless, the explosion of information in basic and clinical neuroscience providing new biochemical targets, additional in vivo models, improved clinical designs, and better validated biomark- ers for PD continues to energize the field and accelerate future research.

Improvement in surgical outcomes has occurred as a direct result of the union of these disciplines, which has led to the development of current surgical approaches for the treatment of PD. Surgical therapy for PD began as a desperate attempt to improve the quality of life of those afflicted with this dis- ease. Early surgeries were based on a rudimentary under- standing of the motor system and resulted from the earnest attempt by physicians and surgeons to aid those most severely afflicted with this disorder. Success was rare, but frequent enough to warrant further efforts. Surgery for PD eventually evolved on the shoulders of scientific studies, which both exposed the problems asso- ciated with these approaches and led to the development of new solutions. While we stand in the twenty-first cen- tury and marvel at the work of our predecessors, won- dering what they were thinking when extirpating the motor cortex, yet marveling at the insights they estab- lished for those to follow, we can only wonder what our colleagues of the future will say when examining our work 100 years from now. This chapter reviews early empirical studies of surgical therapy and the evolution that has led to present neurosurgical approaches for the treatment of PD. We hope to provide a picture of the remarkable progression that has taken place in this field, the unique mixture of disciplines that have led to current therapy, and the subsequent application of these same techniques for other disorders of neurological function. EMPIRICALLY BASED SURGICAL STRATEGIES The earliest surgeries for Parkinson’s disease were pre- dominantly empirically based, derived from a limited understanding of the pathogenesis of parkinsonism and the neuroanatomical basis for motor control. The driving force behind attempting such therapies lay in the desper- ate need of patients, and the willingness on the part of patients and their physicians to explore experimental therapeutic approaches. At the turn of the twentieth cen- tury, the understanding of motor systems focused on peripheral mechanisms and was derived from Sherrington’s work describing rigidity and the role of propriospinal reflexes in the decerebrate animal model (Sherrington, 1898). This led Foerster in 1911 to use bilateral dorsal rhizotomy to treat spasticity in a series of children with cerebral palsy, with beneficial results (Foerster, 1913). Following this work, Leriche, reported the first cases of parkinsonian rigidity treated with dor- sal rhizotomy; however, results were mixed (Leriche, 1912). Nonetheless, the work of Foerster and Leriche fueled further investigations and continued the focus on the peripheral nervous system until 1930, when Pollock and Davis (1930) reported additional cases of dorsal rhi- zotomy in parkinsonian patients. Although dorsal rhizotomy reduced rigidity in some muscles, tremor remained, and some patients developed permanent flex- ion of the wrist, biceps, and neck, leading most to con- clude it was not an effective therapy. After the 1916-1927 epidemic of encephalitis lethar- gica of von Economo, other peripheral surgeries including neurectomy, sympathetic ramisectomies, and 159 CHAPTER 9 Current Neurosurgical Treatments for Parkinson’s Disease: Where Did They Come From?

Results were not encour- aging and the subsequent use of peripheral nervous sys- tem surgeries became increasingly infrequent (The Matheson Commission, 1929, 1932). Although there was early interest in the peripheral nervous system, surgical therapies for movement disor- ders that focused on the central nervous system (CNS) were slow to develop. Victor Horsley, in 1908, used an open approach to excise the precentral gyrus of a patient with severe hemiathetosis (Horsley, 1909). Horsley was aware of the role of the precentral gyrus in motor func- tion but expected a certain degree of redundancy in the control of volitional movements. Indeed, the patient experienced complete postoperative resolution of the dis- abling spasmodic movements, albeit with transient monoplegia followed by a gradual return of some func- tion. After this result, various parts of the pyramidal motor system, including motor and premotor cortex and the corticospinal tracts, were ablated by several groups, guided by the conviction that it was necessary to inter- rupt pathological signals between the cortex and the periphery. The observation that parkinsonian tremor and rigidity improved after stroke was thought to support this idea. Bucy and Case in 1937 first reported the resec- tion of motor cortex for the treatment of PD tremor (Bucy and Case, 1939) (Figure 9.1). Symptoms typically improved after resection or lesioning of the pyramidal system, but the consequent motor deficit resulted in sig- nificant disability. Shortly thereafter, Klemme reported a series of cases with premotor cortex extirpation accom- panied by relief of tremor in over half of patients, with- out paralysis. However, there was still an unacceptably high (17%) rate of postoperative mortality (Klemme, 1940). Surgeons were still reluctant to target the basal ganglia, as a prominent neurosurgeon of the time, Walter Dandy, was convinced that lesions in the extrapyramidal system would result in disorders of consciousness. Corticectomy was ultimately abandoned in the early 1950s because of inconsistent postoperative improve- ment, as well as the substantial rate of associated complications. The extrapyramidal system became a focus of move- ment disorder surgery in the late 1930s. This change in focus was driven by refined anatomical knowledge, in particular by Hassler’s demonstration of a role for the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in PD (Hassler, 1938), and by Spatz’s characterization of the extrapyra- midal motor system and suggestion that it may play a role in the generation of movement disorders (Spatz, 1927). Influenced by these findings, Russell Meyers in 1939 targeted the basal ganglia deliberately and directly. He hoped to disrupt motor circuits thought to mediate the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease without causing significant paralysis. In his first case, he oper- ated on a patient with postencephalitic parkinsonism using an open transventricular approach to the most accessible part of the basal ganglia—the caudate nucleus (Meyers, 1951). The patient had nearly complete resolu- tion of her tremors and improved functional status, allowing her to return to work. Subsequent cases were not as promising, and, citing the lack of a parkinsonian animal model, he went on to systematically target vari- ous extrapyramidal structures, including the anterior limb of the internal capsule and the pallidofugal fibers (Meyers, 1951). In the end, he concluded that sectioning pallidofugal fibers was the most effective; however, all of these approaches carried an unacceptably high mortality rate of 16% to 41%, likely a consequence of the open approach. Nevertheless, this experience established the necessary groundwork for the less invasive approach to the basal ganglia afforded by “closed” stereotactic sur- gery and demonstrated that it was possible to target the extrapyramidal system in the treatment of movement disorders without impairing consciousness or trading involuntary movements for motor deficits. A major first step had been taken. In 1952, Irving Cooper accidentally ligated the anterior choroidal artery during an attempted mes- encephalic pedunculotomy on a patient with posten- cephalitic tremor and rigidity (Cooper, 1953). Cooper aborted the procedure without having performed the pedunculotomy, but the patient awoke from surgery with a significant improvement in contralateral tremor and rigidity, and no motor deficit. This observation led to Cooper’s hypothesis that occlusion of the anterior choroidal artery had resulted in a medial pallidal infarct, and the resulting improvement in the patient’s symptoms—a hypothesis that was consistent with anatomical data of the era. Cooper proceeded to ligate the anterior choroidal artery deliberately in a series of 55 patients with movement disorders before ultimately abandoning the procedure because the variable territory irrigated by the anterior choroidal artery led to unin- tended neurological deficits, including one patient with a postoperative visual field deficit, one with aphasia, and three with contralateral hemiplegia (Cooper and Bravo, 1958). Although results were inconsistent and associated with a high incidence of side effects, the globus pallidum and ansa lenticularis remained favorite targets for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease during the 1950s. Thus within 50 years, the focus of surgery had evolved from the peripheral nervous system to the CNS, and within the CNS the focus had shifted from the pyramidal motor system to the extrapyramidal system. Ch09.qxd 9/1/04 6:37 AM Page 160"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"At the same time, understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of PD had made similar transfor- mations and became focused on the extrapyramidal system and on the basal ganglia, in particular. Still, little was known about the actual function of the basal ganglia, their role in generating the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, or the functional arrangement of basal ganglia circuits. The surgical techniques were still crude, depended on direct visualization of the target structure, and resulted in a wide variety of outcomes. Technological advances were needed and would soon be realized with the application of animal stereotaxis to the human CNS. EARLY STEREOTACTIC SURGERY Horsley and Clarke (1908) described the first animal stereotaxic apparatus, by which Cartesian coordinates (x, y, and z) could be assigned to every point within the brain. Their system was based on three Cartesian planes (midsagittal; basal, running through the external audi- tory canals; and coronal, perpendicular to the other two planes and also running through the external auditory canals). Such stereotaxic systems allowed investigators to insert an electrode or cannula accurately into a desired subcortical target area, with minimal damage to the overlying cortex and white matter. However, variability Current Neurosurgical Treatments for Parkinson’s Disease 161 FIGURE 9.1 Sites of central and peripheral nervous system surgeries attempted for PD. As the surgical treat- ment of PD evolved, surgeons targeted sympathetic chain ganglia, dorsal roots, basal ganglia, and corticospinal fibers at the level of the pyramids, cerebral peduncle, internal capsule, primary motor cortex, or premotor cortex.

Another 40 years elapsed before the combination of intraoperative radiography and the development of a human stereotactic atlas would allow for successful stereotactic surgery in the treatment of human diseases. In 1947, Spiegel and Wycis used intraoperative radiog- raphy to delineate the pineal gland and the foramen of Munro by injecting contrast into the lumbar thecal sac and then obtaining skull x-ray films (Spiegel et al. , 1947a). This technique enabled them to assign Cartesian coordinates based not on skull landmarks, but on deep intracerebral landmarks, and served as the basis for pub- lishing a human stereotactic atlas (Spiegel and Wycis, 1952). Spiegel and Wycis performed their first stereotactic surgeries in human patients in 1947, using the dorsome- dial thalamotomy as an alternative to frontal lobotomy for psychiatric patients (Spiegel et al. , 1947b). A year later, they performed the first stereotactic pallidotomy to treat chorea in a patient with Huntington’s disease (Spiegel, 1966). Interestingly, they did this on the premise that pallidotomy would cause hypokinesis and increased tone. Contrary to their expectations, rigidity was never found to be a complication of pallidal lesions and, in fact, when they began to use lesions of the pallidum and ansa lenticularis to treat “choreatic hyperkinesis” in parkinson- ism, no such rigidity resulted. It was not until later that it became clear that pallidotomy was actually effective in improving rigidity. Notably, operative mortality using the stereotactic apparatus was only 2.0%, compared to 15.7% using Meyers’ open approach (Meyers, 1951). The devel- opment of stereotaxis revolutionized functional surgery by providing a coordinate system with which the human brain could be mapped and by improving the safety of the procedures. As such, human stereotactic technique was the necessary second step toward modern functional neurosurgery. Shortly thereafter, Talairach and colleagues in Paris (Talairach et al. , 1949), Hassler and Reichert in Freiburg (Reichert and Wolf, 1951), Narabayashi in Japan (Narabayashi and Okuma, 1954), and Leksell in Sweden (Leksell, 1949) all developed stereotactic devices and began performing stereotactic pallidotomies. The Paris and Freiburg groups began using the intercommissural line (connecting the anterior and posterior commissures) as the reference line for assigning Cartesian coordinates. Lars Leksell’s device was the first arc-centered (vs patient-cen- tered) stereotactic apparatus (Leksell, 1949). Despite these advances, targeting accuracy remained inconsistent and the optimal target for ablative surgery for PD remained unclear. Early stereotactic pallidotomies were generally placed in the anterior dorsal portion of the pallidum. The results of these anterodorsal pallidotomies were mixed, with some benefit to rigidity, but no long-lasting effect on tremor (Gillingham et al. , 1960; Hassler and Reichert, 1954; Hassler et al. , 1960; Spiegel and Wycis, 1954). Hassler was disappointed with the meager results achieved for tremor following pallidotomy and found that significant tremor suppression in his hands required a very large lesion, which also produced postoperative confusion, sedation, and weakness, likely from lesion extension into the posterior limb of the internal capsule (Hassler et al. , 1960). He subsequently performed detailed retrograde tracing studies and characterized the pallidothalamic and thalamocortical projections. This led him to explore ablative therapy in thalamic areas V.o.a., V.o.p and L.p.o.—areas that receive afferents from the pallidum and cerebellum and project to area 6 and motor cortex (Hassler, 1949, 1953). Hassler’s subsequent work demonstrated that lesions of V.o.a./V.o.p. had some effect on rigidity and lesions of V.o.p./V.i.m. were the best target for tremor (Hassler et al. , 1965, 1970). He felt that thalamic lesions were superior to pallidal lesions for tremor suppression and, at the same time, he was able to avoid making lesions in proximity to the internal capsule. Cooper also concluded that thalamic lesions were better, but he arrived at this in a more serendipitous fashion. Specifically, Cooper attempted to lesion globus pallidus interna (Gpi) in a patient and achieved excellent postop- erative tremor suppression. When the patient died from other causes, an autopsy revealed that the targeting had been off by centimeters and the lesion was actually in the ventrolateral thalamus (Guridi and Lozano, 1997). As a result of these findings, and the inconsistent results of pallidotomy using the techniques of the era, most groups moved to lesioning the thalamus. Leksell was similarly frustrated by the inconsistent results of pallidotomy for tremor, but instead of aban- doning the pallidum, he varied the location of the lesion within the pallidum. Svennilson, a neurologist working with Leksell, systematically analyzed lesion location and outcome in 81 patients who underwent pallidotomy. Leksell varied the lesion site in the first third of this series, finding that the optimal site for reduction of tremor and rigidity was in the ventral posterior pallidum, just anterior to the internal capsule and 20 mm lateral to midline—a target that was substantially posterior to that reported in previous studies (Figure 9.2). After optimiz- ing lesion size in the middle third of patients, Leksell kept the site and size constant in the final 20 patients and achieved a remarkable reduction in tremor and rigidity in 19/20 (95%) of these patients (Svennilson et al. , 1960). Unfortunately, these results did not draw much attention at the time, as many practitioners, swayed by Hassler’s results, had moved to thalamic surgery. Shortly there- after, advances in medical therapeutics would provide an 162 Current Neurosurgical Treatments for Parkinson’s Disease Ch09.qxd 9/1/04 6:37 AM Page 162"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"effective pharmacological therapy for the treatment of PD and arrest advances in surgical therapy for PD for nearly three decades. THE INFLUENCE OF MEDICAL THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES In 1959, Hornykiewicz and Ehringer found that dopamine was decreased in striatal brain homogenates from patients with PD (Ehringer and Hornykiewicz, 1960). Hornykiewicz then convinced the neurologist Birkmayer in 1961 to inject his PD patients with L -dopa, and found striking short-term amelioration of akinesia (Birkmayer and Hornykiewicz, 1961). This was followed by another pivotal report by Cotzias in 1967, document- ing the efficacy of oral doses of D , L -dopa (Cotzias et al. , 1967). When the neurosurgeon, Irving Cooper, heard of the effectiveness of levodopa therapy, he actually diverted 700 of his patients scheduled for surgery to Dr. Cotzias’ clinic for enrollment in this pivotal study. These initial results transformed the treatment of PD, leading to the multiple formulations of levodopa and dopamine agonists in use today. With the advent of effective medical therapies, surgery for PD all but vanished. REVIVAL OF SURGICAL THERAPIES Before long, however, the shortcomings of levodopa in the treatment of PD became obvious. By the early 1970s, it was clear that the response to levodopa became less pre- dictable and increasingly short-lived with continued ther- apy. Despite advances in carboxylase inhibitors and dopamine agonists, medical therapy had not provided an effective sustainable response. Management of levodopa- induced dyskinesia proved even more problematic. Meanwhile, thalamotomies were continued by a handful of surgeons including Hassler’s and Cooper’s groups (Hassler et al. , 1979; Scott et al. , 1970). These groups predominately operated on patients with severe, med- ically refractory tremor and those who could not tolerate medical therapies. At the same time, some groups were beginning to discover that thalamotomy, when extended anteriorly, was effective for reducing rigidity and sup- pressing levodopa-induced dyskinesias (Cooper, 1977; Matsumoto et al. , 1976; Narabayashi et al. , 1984). Thalamic lesions generally have not been reported to improve bradykinesia or akinesia and have been associ- ated with the postoperative worsening of speech and gait disorders in some patients (Selby, 1967; Speelman, 1991). Although surgical therapy continued at a less than prolific pace through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, signif- icant advancements continued to occur, setting the stage for a revival of pallidotomy and later for the introduction of chronic stimulation therapies in the 1990s. Human microelectrode recording (Figure 9.3) was pioneered in France by Albe-Fessard and Guiot in 1960 (Albe-Fessard et al. , 1963, 1966, 1967), allowing for physiological con- firmation of the target and surrounding structures dur- ing surgery. Microelectrode recording has also allowed for the intraoperative testing of physiological hypotheses regarding the basal ganglia and the structures with which they are interconnected. Technology for radiographic targeting also made crit- ical advances during the later half of the twentieth cen- tury. In 1972, Hounsfield (Ambrose and Hounsfield, 1973) and Cormack independently developed computed tomography (CT), with installation of the first commer- cial scanners between 1974 and 1976. In 1973, Lauterbur Current Neurosurgical Treatments for Parkinson’s Disease 163 FIGURE 9.2 Leksell’s target in GPi.

Although these technologies were crude at first, they allowed for the visualization of lesion size and location, provided critical feedback on targeting accuracy, and ushered in the era of CT- and MRI-based stereotactic targeting systems. In 1982, another major advance occurred in PD research, with the discovery that 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) was the etiological agent responsible for the development of parkinsonism in a group of California heroin addicts who used tainted recreational drugs (Langston et al. , 1983). This discovery led to the development of the research tool that Russell Myers longed for in the early 1950s—the development of a nonhuman primate model for PD (Burns et al. , 1983). MODEL-BASED APPROACHES: REVIVAL OF PALLIDOTOMY The MPTP primate model of PD closely resembles the cardinal motor symptoms, as well as the biochemical and pathological profile of the idiopathic human condition. It was not long before Fillion et al. , and Miller and DeLong used microelectrode recording techniques to study the physiological changes in the experimental model. These studies demonstrated increased tonic neu- ronal firing rates in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and in GPi, as well as decreased tonic firing rates in globus pallidus externa (GPe) (Filion et al. , 1985; Miller and DeLong, 1987b). The understanding gained from microelectrode studies, together with a plethora of new neuroanatomical tract tracing studies, led to new hypotheses about the functional organization of the basal ganglia. Alexander, DeLong, and Strick summarized the early anatomical studies and concluded that instead of corticostriatal inputs converg- ing or “funneling” into the basal ganglia, evidence sug- gested that cortico-striato-pallido-thalamo-cortico circuits remain segregated in parallel pathways (Alexander et al. , 1986). They proposed the existence of separate “motor,” “prefrontal,” “oculomotor,” and “limbic” circuits with similar organization but with each circuit projecting from different cortical areas to separate areas of striatum, pal- lidum/SNr, and thalamus. Further studies led to the hypothesis that each of these circuits projected through a “direct” striatal-GPi/SNr-thalamus loop and an “indirect” striatal-GPe-STN-GPi/SNr-thalamus loop (Figure 9.4) (Alexander et al. , 1990). In the motor circuit, supplemen- tary motor area (SMA), arcuate premotor, primary motor and somatosensory cortex have somatotopically organized 164 Current Neurosurgical Treatments for Parkinson’s Disease FIGURE 9.3 Microelectrode physiology encountered when targeting GPi and STN. Typical neural activity is shown for striatum (putamen and caudate), thalamus, GPe (globus pallidus externa), GPi (globus pallidus interna), subthalamic nucleus (STN), substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), and NB (nucleus basalis). Populations of high frequency discharge pausing cells (HFD-P) and low frequency discharge bursting cells (LFD-B) are found in GPe. A line drawing shows a parasagittal representation of these structures from the Shaltenbrand and Bailey Atlas (Schaltenbrand and Bailey, 1959).

The sensorimotor portion of GPi then projects to the ventralis lateralis pars oralis (VLo;Voa, Vop human analog) and lateral ventral anterior pars caudalis (VApc;VA human analog), which then pro- ject back to the SMA and premotor cortex, respectively (Alexander et al. , 1990). Models of basal ganglia function were proposed first by Albin et al. (1989) and later by DeLong (1990b). These investigators proposed a model for hypokinetic disorders based on changes in mean dis- charge rates of basal ganglia structure, which became known as the rate model for PD. The rate model of PD suggests that the loss of dopaminergic cells in the SNc causes a differential effect on neuronal activity in the direct and indirect pathways, and the consequent change in neuronal discharge rates in these pathways leads to the motor symptoms characteris- tic of this disease (Figure 9.4). Loss of dopaminergic input at excitatory striatal D1 receptors was proposed to lead to a decrease in inhibitory activity from the striatum to GPi in the direct pathway. In the indirect pathway, loss of dopamine at inhibitory D2 striatal synapses was pro- posed to produce a relative increase in activity of inhibitory putaminal neurons projecting to GPe, thus leading to decreased neuronal activity in GPe. Resultant decreased inhibitory output from GPe to STN leads to increased mean discharge rates in the STN and excessive excitation of GPi. Thus, by both decreased inhibition of GPi via the direct pathway and increased excitation of Current Neurosurgical Treatments for Parkinson’s Disease 165 FIGURE 9.4 Schematic illustration of the rate model for PD.

Therefore, in the motor pathway, there is inhibition of thalamocortical activity projecting to the SMA and other cortical motor areas, which was considered the underlying factor for the development of hypokinesia and other motor signs associated with PD. In support of this circuit theory, Bergman, Wichmann, and DeLong found that the cardinal parkinsonian symp- toms were ameliorated by excitotoxic (ibotenic acid) STN lesions and could be temporarily improved with reversible inactivation of the STN with the γ -aminobu- tyric acid-A agonist, muscimol (Bergman et al. , 1990; Wichmann et al. , 1994). During these investigations into the pathophysiology of PD, Laitinen reintroduced pallidotomy into the surgi- cal arena by publishing a series of patients he operated on from 1985 to 1990 using Leksell’s successful, but for- gotten techniques (Laitinen et al. , 1992). Unlike Leksell in his series, Laitinen and colleagues now also had the aid of CT-guided stereotactic targeting. They reported that 92% of patients had near complete loss of rigidity, 81% of those with tremor had near complete tremor reduc- tion, and improvements in dystonia, gait, and levodopa- induced dyskinesia were also noted. From the MPTP- primate work, it was clear that improvement of parkin- sonian motor symptoms required targeting of the senso- rimotor circuit. This circuit passes ventroposterolaterally in GPi, accounting for the success of Leksell’s empiri- cally chosen target and the failure of earlier anterodorsal GPi lesions. Furthermore, electrophysiological mapping of the basal ganglia allowed for confirmation of the loca- tion of the sensorimotor region. Several subsequent studies used improved MRI-based stereotactic targeting and intraoperative electrophysiological mapping to place lesions in the sensorimotor portion of GPi with consis- tently beneficial results (Baron et al. , 1996, 2000; Dogali et al. , 1995; Lozano et al. , 1995). Contemporary surgical studies have also benefited from more rigorously blinded study design and standard- ized rating scales (Fahn and Elton, 1987). A prospective single-blind trial randomizing 36 patients to unilateral pallidotomy vs best medical therapy showed that unilat- eral pallidotomy improved the total Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score by 32% over the presurgical baseline while patients with medical therapy alone worsened by 5%. There was significant improve- ment in tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, dyskinesias, gait, and freezing (Vitek et al. , 2003) in the pallidotomy group. Although clearly more effective than medical therapy alone in appropriately selected patients, pallidotomy still had several limitations. While unilateral procedures pro- vided relief from all of the cardinal symptoms on the contralateral side with modest ipsilateral effect, gait and balance did not show consistent long-term improve- ments. Bilateral lesions were required to substantially ameliorate gait and balance disturbances for the major- ity of patients (De Bie et al. , 2002; Favre et al. , 2000; Intemann et al. , 2001; Merello et al. , 2001). Unfortunately, bilateral lesions were associated with an increase in the rate of side effects. Most studies reported significant hypophonia, dysarthria, and worsening cogni- tive and neuropsychiatric function after bilateral pallidotomy (De Bie et al. , 2002; Favre et al. , 2000; Intemann et al. , 2001; Merello et al. , 2001). Although cognitive side effects may occur as a result of encroach- ment on the more anterior nonmotor areas, hypophonia has been a persistent side effect reported by most studies. Similar to bilateral pallidotomy, bilateral thalamotomy was also associated with a high incidence of side effects that precluded the use of such a procedure except under the most dire of circumstances (Matsumoto et al. , 1976; Schuurman et al. , 2000). Neurorestorative approaches were in development at this time, with tremendous enthu- siasm for adrenal and fetal tissue transplantation. This enthusiasm leads physicians to take a more cautious approach toward ablative procedures, not wanting to pre- clude the patient from benefiting from the future use of these technologies. During this time, work with electrical stimulation was underway and was on course to provide a viable alternative to ablative therapies. DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION High frequency stimulation was found to relieve parkinsonian tremor as early as the 1960s, when it was used during intraoperative evaluations by Hassler to test for the optimal site for thalamotomy (Hassler et al. , 1960). Cooper, noting Sherrington’s early work showing cerebellar stimulation in the decerebrate cat reduced extensor tone (Sherrington, 1897), implanted chronic cerebellar stimulators in patients with spasticity and cere- bral palsy beginning in 1973 (Cooper, 1973a, 1973b). He also implanted cerebellar stimulators for the control of epilepsy, based on the theory that cerebellar stimulation increased CNS inhibition (Cooper, 1974). Results of his studies were mixed, and drew criticism for poor experi- mental design and nonstandard evaluation scales (Rosenow et al. , 2002). In 1979, he used deep brain stim- ulation (DBS) with a quadripolar Medtronic electrode in the pulvinar and internal capsule in a patient, with reported relief of her chronic pain and spasticity. He sub- sequently tried thalamic and internal capsule DBS for dystonia, dysarthria, and torticollis (Cooper et al. , 1980). In 1987, as Laitinen was reexploring pallidotomy as an alternative to thalamotomy, Benabid et al. and Blond 166 Current Neurosurgical Treatments for Parkinson’s Disease Ch09.qxd 9/1/04 6:37 AM Page 166"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"et al. , looking for a way to relieve parkinsonian tremor bilaterally, implanted the Medtronic quadripolar elec- trode in the Vim thalamus in patients who already had a contralateral thalamotomy (Benabid et al. , 1987; Blond and Siegfried, 1991). Benabid reported that 88% of patients had improvement in their tremor (Benabid et al. , 1996). However, many of these patients eventually required further surgery because of progression of aki- netic-rigid symptoms or dyskinesias for which Vim-DBS was ineffective (Benazzouz et al. , 2002). The lack of a reli- able effect on the cardinal parkinsonian symptoms other than tremor has limited the use of Vim-DBS for PD and led to the exploration of other targets. By 1992, several critical events had taken place that would transform the field: (1) there was a new understand- ing of the organization and function of the basal ganglia motor circuits with the proposed rate model, (2) there was a renewed interest in the pallidal target brought about by Laitinen’s publication of his experience with pallidotomies for PD, and (3) there was evidence from work with thala- mic Vim DBS, that deep brain stimulation may produce a similar effect to ablative therapy but one that is reversible and without destruction of the target. It was at this time that Sigfried and Lippitz placed bilateral DBS electrodes in Leksell’s target, the ventroposterolateral GPi, in three patients (Siegfried and Lippitz, 1994). Their results were good, and paralleling the effects of pallidotomy, seemed to show improvement in bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, gait, and speech. About the same time, and armed with new evidence that STN lesions also relieved parkinsonian symptoms in the MPTP primate model (Bergman et al. , 1990), Benazzouz et al. (1993) showed that STN stimulation also improved parkinsonism in the MPTP primate model of PD. This finding led to a collaboration with Benabid’s group and the first STN DBS implantation in human patients, with excellent results (Pollak et al. , 1993). In a large, multicenter, prospective, double-blind, but not ran- domized study, both the STN and GPi were targeted in patients with advanced PD. Both targets showed signifi- cant benefit with bilateral GPi DBS, producing 37% improvement in the “off-medicine” UPDRS motor sub- score and STN DBS producing 49% (The Deep-Brain Stimulation for Parkinson’s Disease Study Group, 2001). The only trial completed to date that randomized patients to either target involved only 10 patients and showed no significant difference between groups (Burchiel et al. , 1999). Different centers use widely different targeting techniques; most implantations in STN are bilateral, while many in GPi are unilateral and there is also great variabil- ity in lead placement within each target, making compar- ison between centers difficult. Currently, although both STN and GPi are used to treat PD, the majority of centers performing these procedures target the STN exclusively. REEVALUATION OF THE MODELS With some exceptions, the rate model successfully pre- dicts many of the clinical and electrophysiological changes seen before and after functional neurosurgical interventions for PD. Evidence from patients and from the MPTP nonhuman primate model of parkinsonism demonstrates decreased discharge rates in GPe and VLo and increased mean discharge rates in STN and GPi, consistent with the model (DeLong, 1990a; Filion and Tremblay, 1991; Miller and DeLong, 1987a; Vitek et al. , 1994, 1998a). However, other observations from the “pre-DBS” era contradict the rate model. In particular, lesions in the motor thalamus do not exacerbate or induce parkinsonism but rather improve tremor and rigidity (Hassler and Dieckmann, 1970; Narabayashi, 1982; Narabayashi et al. , 1984). Second, the rate model predicts that a pallidotomy would produce excessive involuntary movements or dyskinesias by disinhibiting the thalamus; however, this is not the case. In fact, palli- dotomy is very effective in alleviating drug-induced dys- kinesia, hemiballismus, and chorea (Speigel, 1966; Suarez et al. , 1997; Vitek et al. , 2000). Albin et al. , read- dressed their model in a 1995 publication and, while pleased with its overall applicability, cited some short- comings, particularly the ability of the rate model to explain the pathophysiology of dyskinesia and dystonia (Albin et al. , 1995). Vitek et al. (1999) reported that in patients with dystonia and hemiballism, there were decreased mean discharge rates of neurons in GPe and GPi. More important, he reported that neurons in GPe and GPi had an irregular pattern of neural activity char- acterized by irregularly grouped discharges separated by intermittent pauses. The characterization of physiologi- cal changes in these disorders has led to the development of an alternative pattern model of basal ganglia function (Vitek et al. , 1994, 1998b, 1999; Vitek and Giroux, 2000). The pattern model of PD (Figure 9.5) postulates that clinical features in movement disorders do not result exclusively from a change in rate of firing but rather from a change in a combination of physiological characteris- tics including pattern, somatosensory responsiveness, degree of synchronization, and rate. In the monkey model, 40% of pallidal neurons develop oscillatory behavior after treatment with MPTP, and these oscilla- tions are often at the frequency of the monkey’s tremor (Nini et al. , 1995; Raz et al. , 2000). There is also evidence of increased synchronization of pallidal neurons, which disappears with dopamine replacement (Havazelet Heimer et al. , 2001; Raz et al. , 1996, 2000). There is also evidence of increased and less specific somatosensory responsiveness of pallidal and thalamic neurons in the MPTP monkey as compared to normal control subjects (Filion et al. , 1988; Vitek et al. , 1990).

There is an evolving consensus that an alteration in the pattern of neural firing plays a key role in the mechanism by which DBS alleviates the motor symptoms of PD and other movement disorders. Electrophysiological studies during STN stimulation in parkinsonian monkeys have documented a net increase in the mean neural discharge rate in GPi cells, suggesting activation of excitatory efferent projections to GPi (Hashimoto et al. , 2003). This effect has been noted only at stimulation rates that are therapeutic; at subtherapeu- tic rates there is no significant difference in the number of neurons with increased, decreased, or unchanged firing rates (Vitek, 2002). Moreover, the pattern of neural activ- ity in GPi was stimulus-locked to STN stimulation, with an increased regularity occurring in GPi neurons during stimulation. These findings are antithetical to the predic- tions of the rate model; as STN output is increased from clinically effective stimulation, the rate model would sug- gest a net excitation of GPi neurons, which in turn would inhibit thalamocortical activity causing a contradictory worsening of motor function. This has not been observed during STN stimulation. Some theories suggest that stimulation might “act like a lesion” by depolariza- tion blockade, synaptic exhaustion, or activation of presynaptic inhibitory afferents to the target structure. While neuronal activity may be suppressed in the STN by one or more of these mechanisms, the net output from the STN is increased as evidenced by increased mean dis- charge rates in GPi during STN stimulation. Further support for stimulation-induced activation comes from studies of GPi stimulation in normal monkeys, which have shown concomitant inhibition of thalamic neural activity consistent with activation of inhibitory GPi pro- jections (Anderson et al. , 2003). Evidence of DBS acti- vation of target nuclei has also been accumulating from microdialysis (Windels et al. , 2000), fMRI (Jech, 2001, 2002; Rezai et al. , 1999), and positron emission tomogra- phy studies (Fukuda et al. , 2001; Haslinger et al. , 2003; Perlmutter et al. , 2002). These observations must be weighed against the evidence that DBS suppresses neu- ronal activity (Benazzouz et al. , 1995; Beurrier et al. , 2001; Dostrovsky et al. , 2000). Thus, although high fre- quency stimulation may inhibit local neurons, the overall output from the structure being stimulated is increased. The explanation for this observation is derived from the- oretical models describing the effect of stimulation on neural tissues at varying distances from the site of stimu- lation (McIntyre and Grill, 2002), which suggest that although local neurons may be suppressed by stimula- tion, axonal elements leaving the target structure are activated. This hypothesis would explain the present experimental results, which are consistent with excitabil- ity profiles of neuronal elements based on their biophys- ical properties (McIntyre and Grill, 1999) and fits with more recent models emphasizing the role of altered pat- terns of neuronal activity in the development of hypoki- netic and hyperkinetic movement disorders. When appreciating the electronic technology used in deep brain stimulation therapies compared to today’s electronic marvels, it appears relatively crude. The quadripolar electrode used is not significantly different from that used in 1979 by Cooper and has the ability to deliver various combinations of tonic bipolar and monopolar currents at different voltage, frequency, and pulse width settings. However, it is not until the current period that advances in neuroscience have brought a suf- ficient understanding of the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease and the mechanisms by which DBS works. With this understanding, we can now embark on the development of new devices that are able to marry advanced computer science engineering with the under- standing of the basal ganglia neural circuitry and models of the effect of electrical stimulation in the brain. NEW DIRECTIONS Mathematical models of the effects of DBS electrodes on neighboring neural tissue suggest a complex combi- nation of excitation and/or inhibition of neighboring cells, afferent inputs, and fibers of passage depending on stimulus parameters and distance from the stimulus probe. Future designs may be able to capitalize on this knowledge to tailor DBS electrode geometries and stim- ulus parameters to selectively isolate intended neural substrates and minimize side effects from stimulation- induced effects on neighboring structures (McIntyre and Grill, 2000). At present, deep brain stimulators deliver a tonic rate of stimulation. As we gain insight into how dif- ferent patterns of basal ganglia activity relate to symptom- atology and how DBS affects these patterns, it is conceivable that stimulators could be designed to deliver different patterns of stimulation that are target-specific. Devices might also be designed that would bear multiple or perpendicularly projecting electrode arrays, allowing for greater postoperative sculpting of the charge distri- bution. This would, in turn, reduce the dependence of clinical outcome on precise lead location and allow for greater long-term modification of stimulation effect as the patient’s underlying disease progresses and symptoms Current Neurosurgical Treatments for Parkinson’s Disease 169 Ch09.qxd 9/1/04 6:37 AM Page 169"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"worsen. Ultimately, as advancements in science parallel advancement in technology, more sophisticated stimula- tors may be developed that deliver state-appropriate stimulation dependent on local neuronal activity (i.e., “smart” programming technology). Although STN and GPi are predominately targeted for the treatment of PD, it remains possible that other targets will provide even greater efficacy. For example, stimulation of the sensorimotor portion of GPe has yet to be formally tested; yet there are data in both animals and humans that GPe-DBS can improve parkinsonian motor symptoms (Russo et al. , 2003; Vitek et al. , in press; Yelnik et al. , 2000). Moreover, we still know very little about the role of projections from the pallidum to the mid- brain extrapyramidal area and pedunculopontine nucleus in motor control and PD and whether future stimulation technologies affecting the activity of these areas might prove beneficial. NEURORESTORATIVE THERAPIES The revolution in dopaminergic medical therapies for PD, launched by Hornykiewicz’s work in 1959 (Ehringer and Hornykiewicz, 1960), has induced a new generation of surgical therapies aimed at restoration of brain dopamine levels or dopaminergic neurons. These thera- pies include fetal and stem cell transplantation and gene therapy and are discussed briefly here, as they are cov- ered in detail elsewhere in this text. Human fetal nigral cells have been implanted in putamen or putamen and substantia nigra, with some studies showing some bene- fit only in patients under age 60, and a high rate of post- operative dyskinesias likely resulting from unregulated production of dopamine in the grafted tissue (Freed et al. , 2001; Mendez et al. , 2002). Embryonic stem cell transplantation remains in the early stages of develop- ment, with some dopaminergic cell lines being tested in animal models (Bjorklund et al. , 2002; Yang et al. , 2003). Another approach has developed from the foundation of knowledge developed from ablative and DBS thera- pies and an understanding of basal ganglia motor cir- cuitry. A Phase I clinical trial has been initiated using gene therapy to deliver glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) into subthalamic glutaminergic cells with the aim of promoting γ -aminobutyric acid production in these cells, thus changing the action of these neurons from excitatory to inhibitory (During et al. , 2001). A third biologic approach is through the use of trophic factors. Either by gene therapy or by direct infu- sion, the use of neural trophic factors has been proposed as a method of promoting the restoration and mainte- nance of degenerating dopaminergic cells (Gill et al ., 2003; Kordower et al ., 2000). An unblinded phase I study of direct infusion of GDNF into the putamen showed a 39% improvement in the off-medicine UPDRS motor score and 61% improvement in the ADL sub-score at one year (Gill et al ., 2003), However, accurate evaluation of the efficacy of this therapy awaits the results of a double- blind randomized controlled trial. CONCLUSION We are constantly reminded of the precarious nature of scientific discovery. It is at times serendipitous, and at times visionary based on well-thought out and methodi- cally tested hypotheses. It is clear that forgotten discover- ies of the past often reappear and may take on added importance once scientific rationale has caught up with earlier observations. Circumstance may rule against progress, as was the case when one of the most effective early surgical therapies (i.e., Lars Leksell’s pallidotomy) was ignored as L -dopa therapies were born. However, as new tools or circumstances permit, the excellent ideas and work of the past are revisited and often contribute anew to the field. The tools that promoted surgical advances are easily apparent from the historical land- scape. We see the effects of retrograde anatomical tracing studies in the hands of Hassler, implementation of the stereotaxis by Horsley and Clark, advancements in neuroradiology from early ventriculography to CT and MRI. No less important are the implementation of microelectrode physiology by Albe-Fessard and Guiot, the development of neurostimulator technologies, and now gene and transplant therapies. Advances in neuro- science have played a crucial role in the progress of this field, laying the groundwork for our understanding of the separate functions of the pyramidal and extrapyra- midal motor systems, the role of dopaminergic neurons in PD, the formulation of the basal ganglia circuit model, newer revisions of this model, and the development of new surgical technologies based on these advances. It seems clear that we will find some advancements of the future elegantly laid out in the past; equally true is the likelihood that dogma developed without basis in fact or supported by scientific study will slow the advancement of others. As we move forward, we are bolstered by the discoveries of our predecessors, the excitement that lies ahead, and the knowledge that we are improving the future for our patients.

For instance, monogenic hereditary neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy generally fall into this category. In many instances the neuropathy can also be actively treated; for instance, in toxic neuropathies by avoidance of the toxin, or, in certain cases, by chelation of it. For neuropathies associated with metabolic disor- ders, active management of the metabolic defect may be sufficient to reverse the neuropathy, as in radiation of a plasmacytoma associated with demyelinating neuropathy, by successful renal transplantation in uremic neuropathy, or by close glycemic control in diabetic neuropathy Implicit in these examples of recovery of peripheral nerve function is the extraordinary capacity of periph- eral neurons (primary sensory, lower motor, and second order autonomic neurons) to regenerate and reconnect under the right circumstances. Suffice it to say that over the past five or more decades, numerous examples of devising the right circumstances, usually referred to as “advances,” have taken place. For the most part, the time frame for advances in management and treatment of peripheral neuropathies has been the past 50 to 75 years, but with an accelerating pace, so that the bulk of therapeutic innovations found to be effective has been introduced in the past two decades. This premise seems to hold particularly true for the treat- ment techniques discovered to be useful in hastening recovery of persons with immune-mediated neuropathies (Table 10.1). It should also be noted that the therapies used for immune-mediated neuropathies are empirical; that is, the mechanism by which they work is still unknown. This is not to say that there was no rationale for trying plasma exchange or intravenous immune globulin; actually there was considerable laboratory and clinical evidence to make one think they might be efficacious. The fact remains, however, that the precise modes of action of these therapies were and still are obscure. The remainder of this chapter focuses on a particular example of treatable neuropathy: the acute immune- mediated neuropathies that fit within the rubric of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). It tells the ongoing saga of how the currently accepted practices used to treat GBS came about and how new therapies may emerge. BACKGROUND GBS is currently thought of as an autoimmune disor- der in which the immune response misdirects against the host’s own tissues, in this instance, peripheral nerve struc- tures. The errant response is most often triggered by an infectious agent (virus or bacterium) or rarely an antigen in a vaccine. A growing body of evidence has accumulated over the last 20 to 30 years to support the autoimmune hypothesis, but before then, many other explanations were proposed. These included the notion that GBS was due to direct infection of nerve tissue, or that a bland swelling of the nerve roots was responsible, or that no primary inflammatory response was involved and that only a minimal, late-appearing, secondary inflamma- tion was sometimes seen. The description of experi- mental allergic neuritis (EAN) by Waksman and Adams 175 CHAPTER 10 Treatable Peripheral Neuropathies: Plasma Exchange, Intravenous Immunoglobulin, and Other Emerging Therapies Arthur K.

(1969) helped to make the case that GBS, like EAN, was inflammatory in nature and most likely autoimmune in origin. A myriad of investigations in the past 20 years document the occurrence of a cascade of immune/inflammatory events that are activated during the early phases of GBS. From these experimental and clinical studies have come the hints and clues that led to successful, albeit empirical, measures that shorten the course and lessen deficit in GBS. As early as 1971, serum from patients in the acute stages of GBS was shown to have demyelinating activity in myelinated peripheral nerve in culture (Cook et al. , 1971). In the late 1970s, reports of beneficial effects of plasma exchange on individual cases of chronic inflam- matory demyelinating polyneuropathy began to appear (Server et al. , 1979; Levy et al. , 1979; Fowler et al. , 1979), 176 Treatable Peripheral Neuropathies TABLE 10.1 Major Clinical Trials of Treatment for Guillain-Barré Syndrome Year Number of Study Trial/Site Reported Patients Follow-up Trial Arms Endpoints Results/ P Value Comment 1 GBS Study 1985 245 6 months PE vs none 1. % improved 1. 59% (PE) vs 39% First major trial Group (18 1 grade at (none), P < .01 showing centers), 4 weeks 2. 19 days (PE) efficacy; USA/Canada 2.

With this knowledge in mind, several investigators undertook pilot trials of plasma exchange in GBS patients. PLASMA EXCHANGE Early in the 1980s, rumors were spreading that plasma exchange was showing therapeutic promise in small, uncontrolled series of patients with GBS. A young police- man from a New Jersey shore community was transferred emergently to our neurology service on which I was attending. He had progressed rapidly from no symptoms to flaccid quadriparesis and beginning reduction of vital capacity, all in a little more than 2 days. The diagnosis was clearly Guillain-Barré syndrome. Our residents favored trying plasma exchange. I did not agree; only anecdotal information was available as to its utility, and the risk ver- sus benefit was unknown. The residents pressed the point; soon agreement was reached that the plasma exchange would be carried out, but in a manner that I would pre- scribe. The residents were smiling. At my bidding, we all gathered in a corner of the patient’s room, and I asked all of the students and housestaff to whisper in unison with me the word plasmapheresis three times. When that was done, I pronounced the plasma exchange complete, staring down all of the dissenters, who respectfully kept their own counsel, if not their smiles. That evening and night, the young policeman with GBS held his own with only minor slippage of the vital capacity; during the next day, he improved rapidly. On attending rounds the residents did not mention the so- called “plasmapheresis” procedure, but the medical stu- dents smirked and whispered behind cupped hands when we approached the patient’s room. Our patient was dis- charged home in ambulatory condition in a few days, never having received any therapy other than supportive care. This anecdote epitomizes the dilemma we faced then, and still do. How does one distinguish therapeutic effect from the natural history of GBS in all of its varia- tions? After all, it had long been known that a prepon- derance of GBS patients make a good recovery with supportive care only (Pleasure et al. , 1968), some more rapidly than others. Several months later in May 1980, at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting, a particular ses- sion on neuromuscular disorders included several presen- tations on the use of plasma exchange in the acute stages of Guillain-Barré syndrome. The series of cases described from the platform were small, a half dozen cases or less per presentation, and were uncontrolled. Most presenters concluded that on balance their patients were improved by the treatment. Among the discussants who came to the microphones after each presentation were doubters who asked whether the treatment effects could be distinguished from the natural history of the disorder. I chaired the session and, after the final presen- tation on plasma exchange for Guillain-Barré syndrome, conducted an informal poll of the crowd packed into the room. All of those present who had undertaken therapeutic plasma exchange in any patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome were asked to raise their hands; perhaps 40 or more did so. Then those who thought that plasma exchange had had a beneficial effect on the illness were asked to raise their hands again. About half the hands went up. And when a show of hands by those who thought there had been no observable effect was requested, a similar number of hands were raised. The session was concluded with a quip from the chair that only good results are reported from the platform and that failures remain unreported. Nevertheless, the question had been posed. A clinical trial was needed. That evening, an impromptu meeting of those potentially interested in participating in a multicenter clinical trial of plasma exchange in Guillain-Barré syndrome was con- vened, at which G.M. McKhann and others from Johns Hopkins laid the groundwork for the decisive North American trial. It required 4 years and 5 months from conception of the trial until the results were formally presented for the first time at the annual meeting of the American Neurological Association in Baltimore in October 1984. The written account was published the following August (GBS Study Group, 1985). The planning, organization, and successful bid for funding (granted by the National Institutes of Health) were underway quickly in 1980. Twenty-one centers throughout the United States and Canada were recruited to join the trial. The study had two arms: supportive care vs plasma exchange plus sup- portive care. A total of 245 patients, a power estimate that was carefully assessed and agreed upon before the trial began, were enrolled and randomized to one of the two arms. Each enrollee was confirmed to be in the first 30 days of Guillain-Barré syndrome and was monitored for 6 months. The final subject was enrolled in April 1984, 4 years after the study was first conceived. An intensive effort to condense and analyze the mountains of raw information occupied the next few months. The leadership of G.M. McKhann and his colleague, J.W. Griffin, and their many collaborators made it all happen. I was the clinical consultant to the project. The formal presentation of results of the trial took place at the annual American Neurological Association meeting in October 1984. Several weeks before that Treatable Peripheral Neuropathies 177 Ch10.qxd 9/1/04 6:38 AM Page 177"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"event, an informal evening meeting of all of the investi- gators and consultants was held in Baltimore. The late E.D. Mellits, the principal statistician for the study, was given the task of presenting the data and their interpre- tation. Before doing so, he asked the same questions that had been posed more than 4 years earlier at the 1980 Academy meeting. Many of the investigators thought that plasma exchange was beneficial, but an almost equal number thought that plasma exchange probably had lit- tle or no effect on the course of Guillain-Barré syn- drome. The latter group, which included myself, was wrong. Plasma exchange significantly shortened the course of Guillain-Barré syndrome as compared to sup- portive care alone. The results were statistically robust, favoring plasma exchange, whether by looking at degree of improvement at predetermined times (4 weeks or 6 months after ran- domization) or by looking at the time required to attain predetermined levels of improvement (one clinical grade on the London scale, or grade 2 on the London scale; grade 2 is defined as the capacity to walk 5 meters with- out assistance). At 4 weeks after randomization, 59% of patients receiving plasma exchange had improved one grade, whereas only 39% of those receiving supportive care alone had improved one grade ( P < .01). The mean improvement was 1.1 grade vs 0.4 grade in the two arms, again favoring plasma exchange ( P < .001). Similarly, the median time required to improve one grade was 19 days for plasma exchanged patients vs 40 days for those receiv- ing supportive care alone ( P < .001). In terms of median time in days to reach grade 2, the plasma exchanged indi- viduals walked unassisted at a mean of 53 days as com- pared to 85 days for the conventionally managed patients ( P < .001). The preceding analyses included all individuals in each of the two arms of the study, regardless of how many days had passed since first symptoms or whether the person had required ventilator support at some point in his or her illness. When those factors were examined, it was apparent that those randomized to the plasma exchange group within the first week of symptoms improved dramatically in relation to those randomized to conventional management in the first week of symptoms. This effect waned as the time from first symptom to ran- domization increased to 2 and then to 3 weeks. In brief, plasma exchange worked better the earlier it was imple- mented and appeared to have little or no effect if started after the third week of symptoms. By the same token, plasma exchange had no significant effect if started after the patient already required ventilatory support. Further analysis using multivariate statistical tech- niques (McKhann et al. , 1988) examined the natural his- tory of Guillain-Barré syndrome as measured in the control arm of the North American trial. The analysis also determined which clinical factors had a significant effect on the rate of recovery. Only four of dozens of fac- tors examined had a statistically significant effect on the rate of recovery, apart from plasma exchange. These four factors, looked at in a dichotomous yes-or-no fashion, were found to correlate with worse outcome in terms of the number of days to reach grade 2 (walking unas- sisted). In order of their predictive power, the factors were: (1) reduction of the mean amplitudes of the com- pound muscle action potentials (CMAP) to less than 20% of expected on electrodiagnostic testing, (2) older age (60 vs 30), (3) severity, as marked by need for venti- latory support, and (4) fulminance, as determined by days from first symptoms to randomization ( ≤ 7 days less vs < 7 days). Those persons with all of the risk factors for poor outcome had only a 39% chance of walking unas- sisted at 6 months, whereas those with none of the pre- dictors (younger, slower onset, no need for ventilator support, and mean CMAP greater than 20% of normal) had a 95% chance of walking unassisted at 6 months. All of these factors, which include age, severity, and fulminance of the attack of GBS, and the initial electro- diagnostic findings, are beyond physician control, but the decision to use plasma exchange is not. In the North American study, plasma exchange had a beneficial effect over and above any or all of these factors. Thus a patient with all four unfavorable findings and not receiving plasma exchange had a 39% chance of walking at 6 months, but if plasma exchange was performed, that person had a 60% chance of walking at 6 months. The chances were even better if the exchanges were started before ventilatory support became necessary. A similar pattern was observed for all of the interme- diate combinations of favorable and unfavorable factors. In brief, plasma exchange shortened the course of GBS and hastened the return to walking without assistance at every level of favorability or unfavorability, and the ear- lier in the illness plasma exchange was begun, the better. Another important lesson can be gleaned from the experience with the North American trial and others: A large trial with more than 100 patients randomized to each arm is essential to obtain definitive answers to ther- apeutic questions about GBS. A corollary is that large, generously powered trials, such as the North American trial (1985), and also the French Cooperative Group trial (1987) and the London-based Plasma Exchange/ Sandoglobulin Guillain-Barré Trial Group (1997), allow statistically significant subgroup analyses that enrich tremendously what can be learned from a single trial. Further, if in large trials, such as those just mentioned, no significant differences in outcome measures are found when comparing two, or perhaps more, treatment approaches, one can have confidence in the equivalency of the compared treatment modes. That is not true of 178 Treatable Peripheral Neuropathies Ch10.qxd 9/1/04 6:38 AM Page 178"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"smaller (a dozen or so subjects in each arm) trials that find no significant difference between compared treat- ment modes; the lack of significance may only reflect lack of power, and not equivalency of the tested treatments. The North American trial was not carried out in isola- tion from what else was going on in the GBS and immune- mediated neuropathy arena. During the time in which the trial was being carried out (1980–1985), two other smaller trials were reported, one showing (Osterman et al., 1984) and the other not showing (Greenwood et al. , 1984) therapeutic effect of plasma exchange. The Swedish study (Osterman et al. , 1984) enrolled 38 GBS patients; 18 received plasma exchange beginning on average by the seventh day of illness. The degree of recovery at 1 and 2 months after exchange was begun was better than the controls ( P < .05). Similar trends were seen in the London study (Greenwood et al. , 1984), but did not reach significance. The latter study enrolled 29 patients, and in the 14 subjects receiving it, plasma exchange was begun on average a week later than in the Swedish study. Both studies, although executed compe- tently, were too small to be conclusive. The French Cooperative Group carried out another major randomized, controlled study of plasma exchange treatment for GBS in the acute stages. This was done more or less concurrently with the North American trial and was reported formally later (French Cooperative Group, 1987). The cut-off for randomization in this study was 17 days from onset of GBS symptoms, vs the North American trial cut-off of 30 days. Like the North American study, the French study was fully powered; 220 patients were randomized into one or other of the two arms, namely, standard of care only vs standard of care with plasma exchange. In the treated arm, four exchanges were carried out, beginning on the day of randomization and repeated on alternate days. The difference between the two groups was striking and favored plasma exchange; it took only 6 days median time to onset of motor recovery vs 13 days in the control group. In the plasma exchange arm, two different replacement fluids were compared (albumin solution vs fresh frozen plasma), but made no difference in outcome. As such, those data were combined for subsequent analyses. Of note, plasma exchange was started earlier on aver- age in the French trial (6.6 days) than in the North American trial (11 days). This difference probably explains the earlier plateau of worsening and beginning of recovery in the French study as compared to the North American observations. Also of interest in the French study was 1-year follow-up results (French Cooperative Group, 1992). In the plasma exchange group, 71% recovered full strength vs 52 % in the control group ( P = .007 ). These observations made in the first two major therapeutic trials in GBS emphasize that the earlier the initiation of treatment in GBS, the better the results. INTRAVENOUS IMMUNOGLOBULIN Human immune globulin, pooled from more than a thousand patients and purified, was introduced as a ther- apeutic agent in the early 1980s, at first for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (Imbach et al. , 1981). Indications for its use in other known or presumed autoimmune disorders were rapidly explored, including myasthenia gravis (Arsura et al. , 1986), chronic inflam- matory demyelinating polyneuropathy (Vermeulen et al. , 1985) and, important for our purposes, a pilot study of GBS (Kleyweg et al. , 1988). As in the other disorders, the use of high-dose pooled, purified human immune globu- lin intravenously (IVIg) showed promise, and soon the Dutch investigators based in Rotterdam and led by F.G.A. van der Meche organized a large, randomized trial to compare IVIg with plasma exchange (PE). The design of the Dutch trial (van der Meche et al. , 1992) called for randomization of 200 patients, with stopping rules if significant differences were found through interim analyses at the time of randomization of the 100th or 150th patient. The stopping rule halted the trial at the 150th patient randomized because IVIg was significantly linked to a high proportion of patients improving one clinical grade on the London scale at 4 weeks after randomization (53% for IVIg vs 34% for PE ; P = .024). The proportion of patients improving one grade at 4 weeks was the primary outcome measure, as it had been for the North American trial of PE vs control group. In retrospect, the design of the Dutch trial and its early halt were unfortunate, mainly because the statistical significance of the result that stopped the trial was due to a remarkably low percentage (34%) of patients in the PE arm improving one grade. In contrast, in the North American trial, the proportion of control subjects who improved one grade at 4 weeks was 39%, and the pro- portion of those receiving PE improved at a robust rate of 59%. Therefore the poor rate of improving one grade at 4 weeks in the patients receiving PE (34%) in the Dutch trial is not readily explained. Nevertheless, that finding stopped the Dutch trial well short of the 200 patients planned, and thus short-circuited many of the subgroup analyses that might have been possible with larger cohorts. Also, results left somewhat ambiguous the issue of whether IVIg was really more efficacious than PE in the management of GBS. In short order, another major trial was organized to address the relative utility of PE and IVIg, including a third arm combining PE and IVIg. This massive trial was organized principally by R.A.C. Hughes in London and Treatable Peripheral Neuropathies 179 Ch10.qxd 9/1/04 6:38 AM Page 179"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"180 Treatable Peripheral Neuropathies involved 383 adult patients in the early stages of GBS hospitalized at 38 centers in 11 countries in Europe, North America, and Australia (Plasma Exchange/Sandoglobulin Guillain-Barré Syndrome Trial Gr oup, 1997). The experi- ence gained from the North American, French, and Dutch trials was invaluable in designing and executing this trial, which, despite its size and complexity, was car- ried out with remarkable efficiency and timeliness. Looking at both the primary and the secondary outcome measures, results showed no difference of significance between any of the three arms, although there was a min- imal trend favoring IVIg and PE. The latter advantage, if it exists, is more than offset by the difficulty of trying to administer both therapies. There is general agreement now that PE and IVIg are equally effective therapeutic interventions for GBS in the acute stage (Hughes et al. , 2003), and the earlier either of the two can be administered, the better the result. It should also be noted that PE is the only thera- peutic intervention that has been established in com- parison to controls, the term “controls” meaning no treatment other than supportive care. IVIg was judged to be therapeutically effective because was shown con- vincingly to be at least as good as PE (Hughes et al. , 2001). From a practical standpoint, IVIg is considerably easier to use, can be more quickly implemented, has a better record for completion of treatment, and has a lower incidence of complications. As a result, IVIg is much more widely used currently in Europe, North America, and the Antipodes than is PE. Nevertheless, the tale of how these two equally effective therapies for GBS were recognized, examined, and established is worth keeping in mind. OTHER APPROACHES A number of other potential therapies have been examined, mainly in small, relatively uncontrolled studies (Wollinsky et al. , 2001; Lyu et al. , 2002); in general they have not excited enough enthusiasm to undertake the kind of large trials used to validate the utility of PE and IVIg. Nevertheless the current therapies leave much to be desired. Mortality, usually from secondary complications of being bedfast and exhibiting respiratory insufficiency, is still near 5%, and nearly 30% of GBS patients have less than full strength at 1 year, including some who are severely disabled. If a person with GBS comes to medical attention early in the course of illness and that person’s illness is quickly realized, if GBS is understood to be a likely diagnosis in that person, if swift action is taken to intervene accord- ingly, and if the agent administered can selectively and rapidly block or reverse the autoimmune process, then better treatments can be devised. This is a tall order that involves both a high level of vigilance for, and awareness of, GBS, and this level of vigilance and awareness must be present throughout both the health care system and the public domain. Further, devising a selective, specific therapeutic agent involves knowing much more in molec- ular and immunological terms about the basis and mech- anism of the autoimmune process and where and how it can be effectively interrupted. Can this be done? Yes. Is the autoimmune process too advanced once clinical deficit is present to be interruptible ? No, there is both human (Hafer-Macko et al. , 1996) and experimental (Kieseier and Hartung, 2003) evidence to suggest that the immune response can be interrupted after clinical weak- ness is already apparent, and that the clinical course can be altered, perhaps dramatically. Can GBS be recognized early enough, assuming a specific disease-targeting ther- apy becomes available? It seems likely that medical awareness of the diagnosis of GBS will be considerably enhanced if specific therapy comes to hand. References Arsura EL et al. (1986).

It is espe- cially helpful in patients who have symptoms of both disorders, whose tics preclude the use of stimulant med- ications for the treatment of their ADHD symptoms. ADHD patients have impaired function of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a higher cortical area critical for the regu- lation of behavior, attention, and affect. Tourette’s patients activate the PFC when they successfully inhibit their tics. The use of guanfacine to treat these disorders arose from research in animals, elucidating the critical neuromodulatory effects of catecholamines on PFC func- tion, interleaved with the astute observations of dedicated clinicians. Studies in genetically-modified mice have iden- tified the α 2A-adrenoceptor as the molecular target for guanfacine’s therapeutic actions. Studies in monkeys have shown that stimulation of this receptor at its postsynaptic sites in PFC strengthens PFC regulation of behavior at the cellular and behavioral levels. There are few examples in neuropsychiatry where neurobiological mechanisms marry so well with clinical actions. The following recounts the stories that led to this successful translation. BACKSTORY 1: YALE UNIVERSITY, NEW HAVEN, CT; 1970s “In the 1970s, I cared for a young boy, Steven, whose nonstop head banging, spitting, eye gauging, spasms, yelling, and swearing excluded him from family and school. As we met together several times a week over sev- eral years, he allowed me to understand a life tormented by destructive urges in which he killed whatever he loved, pushed away whoever came close.” So wrote Donald Cohen, Director of the Yale Child Study Center, as he looked back 25 years to the Tourette’s patients he was caring for and cared about so deeply (Cohen, 2001). There were no effective treatments for Tourette’s Syndrome at the time, and Cohen dedicated himself to finding one. He wondered about the neurobiology of the disease. What changes in the brain could lead to these torturous disruptions of a young life? A few blocks away, at the Connecticut Mental Health Center, George Aghajanian and his graduate student, Jay Cedarbaum, were recording from the noradrenergic (NE) cells of the locus coeruleus (LC) in the brainstem of rats. They had read of work in Europe by Langer, show- ing that α -adrenergic agonists could reduce sympathetic nervous activity through stimulation of presynaptic receptors on NE neurons, and wondered if the same sort of negative feedback could be found in the regulation of central NE neurons. Aghajanian’s group had recently found that the α -agonist, clonidine, could inhibit the fir- ing of LC neurons (Svensson et al ., 1975), and thought this finding deserved further scrutiny. α -Adrenergic receptors were just beginning to be differentiated into α− 1 vs α− 2 receptors and so were still distinguished by their location. Cedarbaum and Aghajanian performed a classical pharmacological study, examining the effects of a series of compounds with differing affinities for α - vs β -adrenergic receptors on LC firing, including clonidine. Clonidine dramatically reduced LC cell firing. They 183 CHAPTER 11 Molecular Pharmacology and the Treatment of Tourette’s Syndrome and Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder Amy F.T.

LC cells are so sen- sitive to the inhibitory effects of clonidine that it had to be carried in a solution ionically diluted 10-fold with NaCl” (Cedarbaum and Aghajanian, 1977). These data had a powerful effect on the neuroscience and medical communities. They created the paradigm for how the field views α− 2 adrenoceptor function: exclusively presy- naptic, powerfully reducing LC firing and NE release—a view that pervades today. However, Cedarbaum and Aghajanian were not so simplistic in their thinking, and even in their landmark paper wrote “On the other hand, postsynaptic receptors similar to the LC α -receptor may exist elsewhere in the brain.” (Cedarbaum and Aghajanian, 1977). Thus, these authors recognized from the beginning that α− 2 receptors likely had differing functions as postsynaptic receptors. It took many years for the neuroscience community to similarly attain this balanced view. Yale Medical School and the Connecticut Mental Health Center are situated in the inner city of New Haven, and in the 1970s heroin addiction was a major focus of drug abuse research. The Aghajanian lab dis- covered that opiates reduced LC firing, much like cloni- dine, and that opiate-addicted rats had a tremendous increase in LC activity when they were withdrawn from opiate treatment (Aghajanian, 1982). Similar results were replicated in monkeys (Roth et al ., 1982). Aghajanian and colleagues wondered if excessive LC activity could contribute to the symptoms of opiate withdrawal in humans, and whether clonidine might allay some of these symptoms. Based on the animal research, Gold and col- leagues tested clonidine in opiate addicts and found it to alleviate many of the symptoms of withdrawal (Gold et al ., 1978). Donald Cohen was intrigued by this research and asked Aghajanian to round with him to experience the patients with profound Tourette’s symptoms. Might they too have excessive NE activity? Might clonidine have soothing effects in these patients as well? For the first trial, they selected Steven, the boy described previously. We estimated the dose and then gathered around his bedside. Forty minutes after the first dose, he fell asleep. When he awoke in one hour, he was already calmer. Over the next days, his symptoms abated, and he became more easily engaged socially and in treatment. The clinical benefits of clonidine in the treat- ment of the disorder seemed apparent in other patients as well. (Cohen and Leckman, 1999). Thus, clonidine became one of the first successful treatments for Tourette’s Syndrome (Cohen et al ., 1979). A few years later, Robert Hunt, working with Cohen, tested clonidine in patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactiviy Disorder (ADHD), another syndrome characterized by disinhibited behavior. Again, clonidine ameliorated symptoms of hyperactivity (Hunt et al ., 1985). Hunt and Cohen hypothesized that clonidine had its therapeutic effects by reducing excessive LC activity, sedating hyperaroused patients to a more optimal level of arousal. Although clonidine’s profound sedative effects (and its severe hypotensive actions) were a problem clin- ically, it was thought that the sedative effects were inher- ent to its therapeutic actions, and thus a necessary side effect if the drug was to work (Hunt et al ., 1990). BACKSTORY 2: THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH, BETHESDA, MD; 1970S Patricia Goldman (later Goldman-Rakic) began her career as a Fellow in the Section of Neuropsychology at the NIMH in 1965 in the lab of Haldor Enger Rosvold and later served as the Chief of the Section on Developmental Neurobiology. Rosvold and his col- league, Mort Mishkin, were engaged in lesion studies of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in monkeys. The very first such studies had been done at Yale in the 1930s, examin- ing the contributions of the dorsolateral PFC to memory. Jacobsen and Fulton (Jacobsen, 1936) created the spatial delayed response task, a test of spatial memory that required constant updating of memory for spatial posi- tion. Jacobsen found a striking loss of short-term spatial memory in monkeys with large dorsolateral frontal lesions. It was research far ahead of its time, and World War II brought it to a quick demise. Studies of frontal lobe began again at Yale in the 1950s, but this time with a very different motivation. Lobotomies were being per- formed at a clipping pace nearby at Connecticut Valley Hospital by surgeons such as Scoville. A few neuropsy- chologists, including Rosvold, were trying to understand how lobotomies worked and did not work, trying to doc- ument what had changed. The monkey studies were reinitiated to aid that process. Karl Pribram performed the neurosurgeries in monkeys. Pribram had been trained as a neurosurgeon by Paul Bucy (of the Kluver-Bucy Syndrome), and Pribram in turn trained Mishkin (and later Hebb and Lashley). Rosvold brought Mishkin with him to NIMH, who there trained Patricia Goldman when she arrived in the Rosvold lab. It was an extraordi- nary dynasty of neurosurgeons, spanning almost a cen- tury, and influencing a foundation of research on the neural basis of memory. Goldman refined the earlier work of Jacobsen; she performed careful lesion studies and defined the critical region for delayed response deficits: the cortex surrounding 184 Molecular Pharmacology and the Treatment of Tourette’s Syndrome and Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder Ch11.qxd 9/2/04 10:50 AM Page 184"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"the caudal two-thirds of the principal sulcus (Goldman and Rosvold, 1970). She showed that this cortex was needed only if the task required both visuospatial and memory processing. At the same time, Fuster (Fuster, 1973), in Los Angeles, and Kubota and Niki (Kubota and Niki, 1971) in Japan were recording from neurons in the PFC as monkeys performed delayed response tasks, and found cells that fired during the delay period when no cue was present. Thus, there was a cellular basis for the memory processes viewed at the behavioral level. This type of memory has come to be called working memory, based on the theories of the psychologist, Baddeley, who derived his concepts of working memory during this same time period (Baddeley, 1981). A few years later, Goldman-Rakic defined the anatomical inputs to the PFC, showing that the principal sulcal cortex receives its visuospatial information from parietal cortex, while other regions of PFC receive visuo-feature, auditory, or affective information (Goldman-Rakic, 1987). Thus, she revealed parallel circuits for guiding behavior based on representations of distinct types of information. Goldman was also interested in other types of inputs to the PFC: the catecholamine-containing axons that arise from brainstem. The catecholamines had been dis- covered at NIMH in the1940s and 1950s by Axelrod and colleagues, and remained a focus of research in neu- ropsychiatry. Aware of this work, Goldman recruited Roger Brown from Carlson’s lab to perform a new tech- nique, high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), so that they could measure catecholamines in the primate cortex for the first time. They found significant and het- erogeneous levels of NE and dopamine (DA) throughout most of the cortex, and found that the PFC had surpris- ingly high levels of DA (Brown et al ., 1979). With a psy- chopharmacologist named Tom Brozoski, , Goldman set out to learn how this DA innervation contributed to PFC working memory function. In their landmark study, Brozoski et al . (1979) selec- tively depleted catecholamines from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex by infusing the catecholamine neuro- toxin, 6-OHDA, into the principal sulcal cortex. They attempted to make selective depletions of DA vs NE, by treating one group with DMI, a drug that blocks uptake of catecholamines and 6-OHDA into NE terminals (the so-called DA-depleted group). Another group received 6-OHDA without DMI (the so-called NE-depleted group). A control group received infusions of the ascor- bic acid vehicle, the ascorbic acid being necessary to pre- vent oxidation of the 6-OHDA. A fourth group received 5.6-DHT + DMI to selectively deplete serotonin. Finally, there were two additional control groups: one that received an ablation of the principal sulcal cortex, and an untreated control group. Following cognitive assessment, detailed biochemical measurements were performed of the principal sulcus and surrounding tissues. Brozoski et al. reported that the DA-depleted group, but not the NE or serotonin-depleted animals, exhibited working memory deficits. The impairment was as marked as that observed with ablation of the tissue itself, and could be ameliorated with systemic treatment of the cate- cholamine precursor, L -dopa, or the DA agonist, apo- morphine. A footnote stated that “Clonidine enhanced spatial delayed alternation performance of virtually all animals” and thus the effect was considered nonspecific. Brozoski et al. concluded that only DA had significant effects on PFC function. This study became the basis for all neuropharmacological studies of PFC. The finding that DA has profound neuromodulatory effects on PFC function continues to shape most theories on the neuro- biological bases of neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, as I arrived at Yale in 1982, the prevailing views were that DA, but not NE, had important modulatory effects on PFC function, that α -2 receptors were exclu- sively presynaptic, and that clonidine had powerful effects at these receptors to reduce NE transmission. NOREPINEPHRINE ENHANCES PFC FUNCTIONS VIA ACTIONS AT POSTSYNAPTIC α− 2A-ADRENOCEPTORS Patricia Goldman-Rakic moved to Yale in 1979. I joined her shortly thereafter as a postdoctoral fellow to examine the contribution of DA loss to age-related cog- nitive decline. Brown and Goldman-Rakic had shown that there is an extensive depletion of DA from the PFC with advancing age, while other DA terminal fields show more subtle changes (Goldman-Rakic and Brown, 1981). I wanted to determine whether the same compounds that had improved the young, 6-OHDA-depleted monkeys would also improve the working memory abilities of the aged monkeys. I found that apomorphine and L -dopa had very mixed effects, but that clonidine had surpris- ingly robust beneficial effects on working memory performance in the aged monkeys. I remembered the footnote about clonidine in the Brozoski paper, and gave Tom a call. He very generously sent me all the biochemical and cognitive data from the study. The data were extraordinary. They showed that clonidine’s enhancing effects were not nonspecific: there was a pattern. The vehicle-infused animals were improved by clonidine, but their levels of NE were not normal. The ascorbic acid in the vehicle solution had induced a depletion of NE from the principal sulcal cortex. What’s more, the degree of improvement with clonidine directly related to the amount of NE depletion: those monkeys with the greatest NE loss (the 6-OHDA group) were the most improved, those with Molecular Pharmacology and the Treatment of Tourette’s Syndrome and Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder 185 Ch11.qxd 9/2/04 10:50 AM Page 185"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"smaller NE depletion (6-OHDA + DMI; acsorbic acid) were modestly improved, and those with normal NE levels (unoperated or preoperated) showed little improvement (Figure 11.1; Arnsten and Goldman- Rakic, 1985). It was a classic example of postsynaptic supersensitivity. But this meant two things: (1) α− 2 receptors must be localized postsynaptically as well as presynaptically, especially in the PFC, and (2) NE, as well as DA, must influence PFC cognitive function. Postsynaptic Actions Working with Jing Xia Cai, Jenna Steere Franowicz, and others, we built on this initial research in several directions. Cai showed that clonidine’s beneficial effects were enhanced rather than diminished in monkeys treated with reserpine, a compound that depletes the presynaptic terminal of monoamines (Cai et al ., 1993). This was a classic test of pre- vs postsynaptic function, confirming our original finding. Thus, animals with cat- echolamine depletion, either due to normal aging or a neurotoxin, were improved by clonidine, and those with the greatest depletion were improved the most by the drug. Similar findings were emerging in humans: Clonidine improved the performance of patients with Korsakoff ’s amnesia on tests of recall memory and the Stroop interference task (Mair and McEntee, 1986), a test that relies on PFC function, and these beneficial effects of clonidine directly correlated with indices of NE loss as measured by CSF MHPG (McEntee and Mair, 1990). Thus, as with the monkeys, those with the greatest NE loss were the most improved by clonidine. These data encouraged our views that clonidine acted postsynapti- cally, and that the findings we saw in animals were relevant to humans. A few years later molecular biologi- cal tools became available, demonstrating that the vast majority of mRNA for α− 2 receptors resides in noncate- cholamine neurons (Scheinin et al ., 1994), confirming the important role of postsynaptic α− 2 receptors in the brain. Dissociating Cognitive and Sedative Actions Clonidine produced dramatic improvements in work- ing memory, but it also produced pronounced sedative and hypotensive side effects. The aged monkeys would look wan and sleepy while performing near perfectly on the task. Although clonidine was tried in a variety of clinical disorders, it was clear that these side effects would severely limit its utility. Was there any way to dis- sociate the sedation and hypotension from the working memory enhancement? In the mid-1980s, the labs of Frances Leslie (Boyajian and Leslie, 1987) and David Bylund (Bylund, 1985) independently provided evidence for subtypes of α− 2 receptors. I was close friends with the Leslie lab, and they showed me their autoradiographs while the study was still in progress. I wondered if we could see evidence of subtypes at the behavioral level. The Leslie lab described two sites in brain, the rau- wolscine-sensitive site (Rs, now known to be the α− 2C receptor), which was dense in striatum, and the rau- wolscine-insensitive site (Ri, now known to be the α− 2A receptor), which had a broader distribution. Agonists had varying affinities for these sites: guanfacine preferred the Ri site, while clonidine and BHT920 preferred the Rs site. Working with Jing Xia Cai, who was visiting from China, we assessed these compounds in our aged mon- keys for their effects on working memory, blood pressure, and sedation. At first, the compounds all seemed rather similar; high doses of guanfacine improved working memory and produced some hypotension and sedation. To be rigorous, we decided to explore a wider dose range, and include very low doses as well as the high doses. We always test the monkeys “blind” to drug condition. One evening I was testing a particularly distractible aged monkey named “Chat;” she could only remember the correct spatial position over a few seconds before divert- ing herself with something in the test cage or grooming. This evening Chat was totally different. When the screen came up she was not picking at her foot or manipulating the caging, she was completely focused on the task. Her eyes were like laser beams, without a hint of sedation. She performed near perfectly and I knew something important had happened. After testing I broke the blind: it was a very low dose of guanfacine. A comparable pro- file was observed in the other aged monkeys. The low doses had no effect on blood pressure, and no signs of sedation, yet improved cognitive performance (Arnsten 186 Molecular Pharmacology and the Treatment of Tourette’s Syndrome and Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder DOSE OF CLONIDINE (mg/kg) 0.0 .01 .02 .04 .08 PRE OP % CHANGE FORM SALINE 40 20 0 SMALL NE LOSS LARGE NE LOSS FIGURE 11.1 The potency of clonidine in enhancing spatial working memory performance in monkeys is directly related to the degree of noradrenergic (NE) depletion in the principal sulcal prefrontal cortex. These findings are consistent with clonidine acting at supersensitive, postsynaptic α -2 receptors in the prefrontal cortex. (Adapted from Arnsten and Goldman-Rakic, 1985). Ch11.qxd 9/2/04 10:50 AM Page 186"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"et al ., 1988). Shortly thereafter, we saw similar effects with UK14304, another agonist that preferred the Ri site as assessed by the Leslie lab (Arnsten and Leslie, 1991). We concluded that low doses of agonists with higher affinity for the Ri site such as guanfacine and UK14304 could improve working memory without hypotensive or sedative side effects, whereas drugs like clonidine and BHT920 with higher affinity for the Rs site only improved working memory at higher doses that induced a prominent side effect profile (Figure 11.2). Thus, it was possible in an aged animal with naturally occurring cate- cholamine depletion to completely dissociate the sedative and cognitive-enhancing effects of these compounds. The enhanced performance on the task was not simply due to sedating the animal to a more optimal level of arousal, but to strengthening PFC regulation of behavior. Identifying the Molecular Target Within a few years cloning became possible and three cloned subtypes of α− 2 receptor were identified in humans: the α− 2A, α− 2B and α− 2C subtypes. Using an antibody directed to the α− 2A subtype, Chiye Aoki demonstrated that the α− 2A receptor was localized over the postsynaptic density on dendritic spines of pyramidal cells in monkey prefrontal cortex (Aoki et al ., 1994; Aoki et al ., 1998a; Aoki et al ., 1998b; Arnsten et al ., 1996). She also saw the receptor at other cellular locations, including presynaptic sites, but there was no doubt that the α− 2A receptor was in the ideal position to influence working memory function. The Ri was now known to be the α− 2A subtype, but we did not know for certain that this was the critical receptor for guanfacine’s beneficial effects on working memory. Guanfacine prefers this receptor, but by rigor- ous definition it is not truly selective for this site. The advent of genetically altered mice allowed us to strin- gently test the role of the α− 2A subtype for the first time. Both the α− 2A and α− 2C subtypes had been identified in the PFC. The Tanila lab in Finland examined wild-type vs α− 2C knockout mice in a spatial working memory task. The α− 2C knockout mice performed normally on the task, and showed enhancement with an α− 2 agonist just like the wild-type animals (Tanila et al ., 1999).

In contrast, clonidine improves working memory only at higher doses that produce prominent sedation and hypotension. (Adapted from Arnsten et al. , 1988). Ch11.qxd 9/2/04 10:50 AM Page 187"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"same time, Jenna Franowicz and I were examining mice with a functional knockout of the α− 2A receptor, mice created by the Limbird lab at Vanderbilt and donated to us by the Kobilka lab at Stanford. This work was part of Jenna’s PhD thesis. She found that the wild-type mice were improved by guanfacine just like our monkeys, but the α− 2A mutants showed no effect with the drug (Figure 11.3; (Franowicz et al ., 2002)). Furthermore, although the α− 2A mutant mice learned the spatial working memory task as fast as the wild-type animals, they had weaker working memory abilities and were not able to perform well with delays of more than a few sec- onds (Franowicz et al ., 2002). Thus, this work definitively showed that the α− 2A subtype was the molecular target for guanfacine’s beneficial effects on working memory. Parallel studies in knockout mice have shown an impor- tant role for this subtype in the sedating and hypotensive effects of α− 2 agonists (MacDonald et al ., 1997). However, the sedative effects likely involve a wide inter- play of α− 2 receptors, including receptors in locus coeruleus ( α− 2A and C), cortex ( α− 2A and C), thalamus ( α− 2B), basal forebrain, and spinal cord ( α− 2A and C?). Specificity of Actions in Prefrontal Cortex The enhancing effects of α− 2 agonists are specific to PFC cognitive functions. Systemic administration of clonidine, guanfacine and other α 2 agonists to monkeys or rats improves the performance of a variety of PFC tasks: spatial as well as object working memory tasks dependent on lateral PFC, as well as reversal tasks dependent on ventral PFC that require behavioral inhibi- tion (reviewed in Arnsten and Robbins, 2002). The α− 2 agonists are especially helpful under distracting condi- tions when interference is high and PFC functions are challenged (Arnsten and Contant, 1992). Conversely, NE depletion, like PFC lesions, increases distractibility (Carli et al ., 1983; Roberts et al ., 1976). In contrast, α− 2 ago- nists have no effect on non-PFC tasks such as recognition memory, visual pattern discrimination, or covert atten- tional orienting dependent on medial temporal, inferior temporal, and parietal cortices, respectively (Arnsten and Robbins, 2002). We performed a SPECT imaging study of monkeys administered guanfacine vs saline while per- forming a spatial working memory task and found that guanfacine improved performance and increased regional cerebral blood flow in the same region of PFC that Goldman-Rakic had earlier shown to be most criti- cal to spatial working memory, the caudal two-thirds of the principal sulcal cortex (Figure 11.4A; See also the Color Plate section; (Avery et al ., 2000)). Guanfacine had no effect on regional cerebr al blood flow in auditory asso- ciation cortex, a region unchallenged by the task. Thus, specificity was observed with systemic administration in both cognitive and imaging studies. We have collaborated with Bao Ming Li’s lab in China to show that α− 2 agonists act directly within the PFC to enhance working memory. Thus, infusions of guanfacine directly into the prinicpal sulcal PFC produced a delay- related improvement in working memory (Mao et al ., 1999), while blockade of α− 2 receptors in this same region with yohimbine dramatically impaired working memory performance in a delay-related manner (Li and Mei, 1994). More recently the Li lab has shown that yohimbine infusion into the PFC induces impulsive errors on a go–no-go task similar to that used in ADHD children (Ma et al ., 2003). They have also observed that intra-PFC yohimbine infusions induce locomotor hyper- activity (B.M. Li, personal communication). Thus, the cardinal symptoms of ADHD can be reproduced by blocking α− 2 receptors in PFC. Bao Ming Li has shown similar effects at the level of the single cell. Iontophoretic application of yohimbine onto PFC neurons in monkeys performing working memory tasks reduced delay-related activity, the cellular measure of working memory, with- out effecting spontaneous cell activity (Li et al ., 1999). Similar effects were observed in Japan by Sawaguchi (Sawaguchi, 1998). Conversely, Li et al. showed that ion- tophoretic application of clonidine strengthened delay- related activity (schematically represented in Figure 11.4B; see also the Color Plate section), and that this increase in delay-related firing could be revered by iontophoretic application of yohimbine (Li et al ., 1999). Systemic administration of clonidine at a dose that improves delayed response performance also increased delay-related firing of PFC neurons (ibid). It is remarkable to have such consistency at the cellular and behavioral levels. 188 Molecular Pharmacology and the Treatment of Tourette’s Syndrome and Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder GUANFACINE IMPROVES WORKING MEMORY IN WILD TYPE, BUT NOT α 2A MUTANT MICE 70 SAL GFC Wild Type α 2A Mutant SAL GFC 80 % CORRECT 90 FIGURE 11.3 The α -2 adrenoreceptor agonist, guanfacine, improves delayed alternation performance in wild-type mice, but has no effect in mice with a functional knockout of the α -2 A receptor.

These receptors are com- monly coupled to Gi proteins which inhibit cAMP/ protein kinase A intracellular signaling. Most research on second messenger mechanisms in mammals has focused on the hippocampus, where activation of cAMP/protein kinase A is needed to sustain long term potentiation (LTP) and consolidate memory (Frey et al ., 1993). However, our data indicate that activation of pro- tein kinase A in PFC impairs working memory (Taylor et al ., 1999), perhaps consistent with the constant updat- ing and fluidity required of working memory function. Our recent data suggest that protein kinase A signaling is activated by stress exposure (Arnsten, 2000), and becomes disinhibited with advancing age (Ramos et al ., 2003). Therefore, some of the beneficial effects of α− 2A agonists in stressed and aged animals may result from inhibition of detrimental protein kinase A signaling. Beneficial Influences of Presynaptic α -2 Receptors on PFC function Stress also impairs PFC function through activation of protein kinase C intracellular signaling (Arnsten, 2000). The doctoral thesis of Shari Birnbaum has shown that high levels of NE released during stress engage α− 1 receptors, which in turn activate protein kinase C and impair working memory (Birnbaum et al. , 2004). Thus, α− 2 agonists may have a protective effect on PFC func- tion during stress by reducing high levels of NE release and decreasing high levels of tonic LC cell firing via presynaptic α− 2A and α− 2C receptors, thus reducing harmful α− 1 receptor actions in the PFC. However, Birnbaum observed that guanfacine was more potent than clonidine in protecting working memory from stress, even though clonidine is 10 times more potent than guanfacine in reducing LC firing and decreasing NE release (Birnbaum et al ., 2000). Thus, postsynaptic α -2 receptor actions likely play an important role even under conditions of high NE release. In summary, a highly consistent story has emerged from labs in China, Finland, England, Japan, and the United States, demonstrating that NE strengthens PFC function at the cellular and behavioral levels through activation of postsynaptic α− 2A receptors. TRANSLATION TO THE CLINIC Guanfacine translated from the lab to the clinic due to discussions with physicians deeply interested in α -2 adrenoceptor mechanisms for childhood disorders. In the early 1990s, I was asked to give a seminar at Vanderbilt University. Robert Hunt was in the audience, and we spoke at length after the seminar, planning an open trial of guanfacine in ADHD. Donald Cohen also asked me to give a seminar at the Yale Child Study Center, pre- senting our findings that low doses of guanfacine could improve working memory and protect performance from distraction with few sedative or hypotensive effects. Donald later worked with Mark Ruddle and Phil Chappell to assess guanfacine in an open label study of children with both tics and ADHD symptoms who could not take stimulant medications. The Hunt (Hunt et al ., 1995) and Chappell (Chappell et al ., 1995) papers were published in 1995, along with a third open trial Molecular Pharmacology and the Treatment of Tourette’s Syndrome and Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder 189 FIGURE 11.4 A: A single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging study of rhesus monkeys performing a spatial work- ing memory task found that guanfacine significantly increased regional cerebral blood flow in the principal sulcal prefrontal cortex.

B: Many prefrontal cortical neu- rons exhibit increased firing during the delay period while monkeys perform a delayed response task. These cells are often tuned (e.g., firing only if the cue had been on the right but not on the left side). Bao Ming Li has shown that either systemic or iontophoretic application of cloni- dine significantly increases delay-related firing of prefrontal cortical neurons without altering spontaneous firing rate (Li et al. , 1999). This finding is schematically depicted in Figure 11.4B. (See also the Color Plate section.) Ch11.qxd 9/2/04 10:50 AM Page 189"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"(Horrigan and Barnhill, 1995). These positive results encouraged more rigorous analysis of guanfacine. The first double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of guanfacine in children with ADHD and tics was carried out at the Yale Child Study Center by Scahill et al . (2001). This study showed that guanfacine significantly improved teacher ratings of both inattention and hyper- activity/impulsivity. It also improved performance of the Connors Continuous Performance Task, a test that requires sustained attention and behavioral inhibition, functions reliant on PFC. Guanfacine also reduced the number of tics. The Tourette’s Center at Yale had shown in functional imaging studies that the dorsolateral PFC is activated when Tourette’s patients successfully inhibit their tics (Peterson et al ., 1998). Thus, it is possible that guanfacine helps reduce tics through a similar mecha- nism: strengthening PFC inhibition of an abnormal process in deeper basal ganglia structures. Another controlled study has shown that guanfacine can ameliorate ADHD symptoms in adults with ADHD (Taylor and Russo, 2001). Interestingly, this study found that guanfacine was superior to stimulants in enhancing performance of the Stroop interference task, again point- ing to a PFC mechanism. A similar pattern has emerged in normal adults given acute guanfacine. Reminiscent of the results in monkeys, guanfacine improved perform- ance of tasks dependent on the PFC such as spatial working memory, paired associates and planning, but did not improve recognition memory (Jakala et al ., 1999a,1999b). The same battery of tasks has recently been given to ADHD patients, and interestingly, they are impaired on the very same PFC tasks that are improved by guanfacine (McLean et al ., 2003). An extensive litera- ture now documents that ADHD patients are impaired on a host of PFC tasks (reviewed in Arnsten et al ., 1996), and both functional and structural imaging studies have demonstrated that PFC-striatal-cerebellar circuits are disrupted in patients with this disorder (reviewed in Arnsten and Castellanos, 2002). Thus, guanfacine may provide a rational therapy, strengthening PFC regulation of behavior and attention. Guanfacine and similar agents are being tested in other patient populations (schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder) where PFC cognitive deficits contribute to disability (Friedman et al ., 2001; Horrigan, 1996). The pioneering studies of Jacobsen, Kubota, Fuster, and Goldman-Rakic have given us the paradigms to ana- lyze our highest cognitive abilities, subserved by pre- frontal cortical circuits. We have learned that prefrontal cortical neurons can fire to stimuli that are no longer in the environment, allowing us to hold in mind representa- tions of faces, events and places, and rewards and punishments from the distant or recent past. These rep- resentations can inhibit our thoughts, feelings and actions, and direct us toward worthier goals: a cohesive sentence, a math assignment completed, a horrible mem- ory suppressed, so that we may go on living. These are the cognitive processes most assaulted in neuropsychi- atric illness. Our ability to understand the neurochemical processes that strengthen or weaken prefrontal cortical abilities will give us the tools to treat these illnesses, and the wisdom to view these disorders with compassion rather than disdain. It is my hope that future strategies for the treatment of neuropsychiatruc illness will be sufficiently informed by basic neuroscience to permit a wholly rational approach: (1) A sound understanding of the brain circuits underly- ing distinct neuropsychiatric symptoms, (2) a knowledge of the neurochemical needs of those circuits and if pos- sible, the neurochemical changes in those circuits associ- ated with the disorder, and (3) the ability to optimize the neurochemical environment for that circuit with the appropriate medication, ultimately with compounds that are delivered to that circuit selectively. This strategy would only be effective if the substrate for drug actions is present (i.e., drugs like guanfacine do not work if the PFC is ablated) (Arnsten and van Dyck, 1997). However, this strategy may be very effective in disorders such as ADHD, bipolar disorder and posttraumatic stress disor- der where the cerebral architecture remains generally intact. THE PROCESS OF DISCOVERY Several themes recur as one examines the elements that facilitate the discovery process. Perhaps most evident is the importance of an intellectually rich and adventur- ous research community that promotes the cross- pollination of ideas. New discoveries are generally made by physicians and scientists who are both curious and open-minded about research outside their own area of expertise and who actively seek out novel perspectives. It is certainly important to disregard false boundaries such as neurological vs psychiatric disorders, molecular vs behavior research, and to recognize that insights can emerge from a variety of frameworks. These associations between seemingly disparate arenas are certainly among the most joyful of scientific experiences. They are the reward of disciplined study: “In the field of observation, chance favors only the prepared mind” (Louis Pasteur 1854). Discovery also seems to be facilitated by immersion in the raw data (be it the symptoms of a disorder or the per- formance of a monkey on a task). Highly digested or preinterpreted data can remove the very patterns most needed to detect new mechanisms. And it is critical to be rigorously objective and thus adventurous in one’s 190 Molecular Pharmacology and the Treatment of Tourette’s Syndrome and Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder Ch11.qxd 9/2/04 10:50 AM Page 190"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"thinking, to try not to be contaminated by current fash- ions in thinking. Perhaps most difficult of all is to see the data for what they are, free of one’s own wishes for them. One must have a guiding vision, and yet the ability to dis- card that vision when the data disagree (a mental flexa- bility that requires PFC function!). Theories allow us to see patterns and realize that they are clues, but they can also prejudice our vision and create inertia. We are always fooling ourselves in some manner, and yet, there is no better way to proceed. References Aghajanian GK (1982).

This chapter discusses the ways in which neuroscience and neuropsychopharmacology are beginning to provide a new improved understanding of these disorders. The delineation of the underlying neurobiological abnormali- ties will provide the methods to define more homogenous diagnostic subgroups. This in turn will allow a greater opportunity for the development of direct, targeted, and more efficacious treatments. Functional abnormalities in the corticotropin-releasing hormone and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis have been observed in patients with depression and anxiety and molecular abnormalities, as possible causes of these abnormalities are now being eval- uated. Imaging studies have disclosed atrophy in the hippocampus in depression that is reversed with antide- pressant treatment. This finding is supported by powerful evidence from preclinical research showing that stress decreases neurogenesis and cell survival in the hippocam- pus, which is reversed with antidepressant treatment. In addition, the molecular and cellular pathways involved in neuroplasticity and cell survival have been found to be influenced by several other drugs effective in the treat- ment of mood disorders. The pathways and cellular constituents involved in conditioned fear are being eluci- dated, and the molecular and pharmacological factors underlining fear acquisition and extinction are being delineated. This information will allow the development of more physiologically relevant pharmacological and behavioral treatments for anxiety disorders. Candidate genes are being investigated and initial results are promis- ing. Individuals homozygous for the short allele of the serotonin transporter have been shown to be particularly vulnerable to the stressful life events and childhood maltreatment that can cause depression. The new under- standing of molecular and neurobiological pathogenesis will allow the definition of new clinical subgroups where rational treatments can be directed at the cause of illness. This in turn will improve efficacy and ultimately lead to prevention of these disabling disorders. BACKGROUND Epidemiology There is a high prevalence of depression in the commu- nity and when other medical illness is present, prevalence rates are much higher. The most recent national survey reports a 16.2% lifetime and 6.6% 12-month prevalence of major depressive disorder in the United States (Kessler et al. ., 2003). The prevalence is increasing with each new birth cohort. As can be seen in Figure 12.1, 25% of indi- viduals who are currently in their twenties can expect to have a major depressive episode during their lifetime. Because of its high prevalence and disabling symptoms, depression causes the fourth highest number of disability adjusted life-years of all medical conditions occurring worldwide. Thus, depression is listed as the fourth highest worldwide cause of burden of disease, with only lower respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, and perinatal disorders ranked higher (Murray and Lopez, 1997). There is a high comorbidity of depression and anxiety, with 59% of depressed individuals having a comorbid anxiety disorder and also a 25% rate of substance use and a 25% rate of impulse control disorder, with a 70% rate for any other disorder (Kessler et al. , 2003). The use of formal diagnostic criteria that requires an individual to manifest a high level of symptoms to be labeled a case 193 CHAPTER 12 Neuroscience, Molecular Medicine, and New Approaches to the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety George R.

For instance, there is a more than sixfold increase in preva- lence of panic attack symptoms, as the criteria for diag- nosis are less stringent (Figure 12.2) (Eaton et al. , 1994). This is important because symptom levels too low to meet full criteria for a disorder according to the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition (DSM IV), can still have major effects in terms of disability and mortality. For example, it has been known for some time that the presence of major depression, as defined in DSM IV, increases mortality in individuals with cardiac disease. However, as illustrated in Figure 12.3, even low levels of depression that are usually not thought to be clinically relevant are also associated with a fivefold to sixfold increase in percent mortality (Bush et al. , 2001). The importance of the comorbidity of depression on overall subjective well-being is illustrated in individuals with car- diac disease in Figure 12.4. Severity of impairment of left ventricular ejection fraction, which directly relates to mortality, did not relate to subjective symptom burden, physical limitation, quality of life, or overall health. Ischemia, as measured by exercise capacity on the tread- mill test, did significantly relate to all four subjective cat- egories, especially physical limitation; and, most important, depressive symptoms related the strongest to the four subjective categories, even more strongly to physical limitation than did exercise capacity. This illus- trates the pervasive effect that depression can have on quality of life (Ruo et al. , 2003). There is at least a doubling of the rate of depression in most medical illness, and there is an increased rate of depression the more severe the illness. For example, in a mail survey of individuals with multiple sclerosis, 42% reported clinically significant depressive symptoms. There was a 58% increase in severity of depressive symptoms reported by those individuals who had advanced disease vs those who had minimal disease (Chwastiak et al. , 2002). Individuals reporting a chronic painful condition seem to have an especially high rate of depression. In a large phone survey in Europe, com- pared to individuals reporting no pain and no illness, those reporting a medical illness had an odds ratio of 1.2 of having depression, those reporting a chronic painful condition had an odds ratio of 3.4, and those reporting both a medical condition and a chronic painful condition had an odds ratio of 5.1. Thus, the effect of a medical condition and chronic painful con- dition appears to be additive (Ohayon and Schatzberg, 2003). Taken together the epidemiological findings indicate a high prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders in the community, and even higher rates of depression are associated with a wide range of medical illness. The importance of depression on mortality and quality of life is well illustrated in cardiovascular disease, where the Predicted Cumulative Lifetime Prevalence of Major Depression by Age 30 (percent) 20 15 10 25 5 Birth Year 1941 or before 60 and over 1942-1956 45-59 1957-1971 30-44 1972-1983 18-29 Current Age (2001-2002) FIGURE 12.1 Depression is increasing in young people.

Historical Emergence of Neuropsychopharmacology and Neuroscience Descriptions of depression and anxiety date back to the earliest written records, and the interaction of innate factors within the individual with environmental demands has always been recognized. As an example, in 800 BC, Saul, King of Israel, developed depression, guilt, and incapacity. Among the treatments was placing a young woman in his bed and playing soothing music. He later became “psychotic” and attempted to kill members of the royal household.

There are no objective measures from laboratory chemistries, imaging, electrophysiological studies, or functional tests included to help make a positive diagnosis of these conditions. During the 26 years from the publication of DSM II in 1968 to the publication of DSM IV in 1994, the number of descriptive diagnoses listed in DSM IV has doubled from 182 to 365. The number of anxiety diagnoses has increased fourfold, and the number of diagnoses in depression increased from 8 in 1968 to a possibility of more than 40 in 1994 depending on the specifiers used. As described later, this proliferation of diagnostic sub- types does not mean that we have a better understanding of pathophysiology with the consequent improvement of specificity and efficacy of treatment. The neuropsychopharmacology revolution starting in the mid 1950s introduced an entirely new dimension of treatment for depression and anxiety. Previously, “moral” and psychosocial treatments (with some use of electroconvulsive treatment [ECT], and sedatives) were the only treatments available. The finding in the 1950s that lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) at doses as low as 0.1 μ g/kg could alter normal consciousness and produce reliable alterations in perception, cognition, and affect was a major catalyst to the neuropsychopharmacological revolution that has dominated progress during the last 50 years. During this time period the substantial advances in the methods and ideas of neuroscience have swept neu- ropsychopharmacology forward. Considering that sero- tonin (5-HT) was just being identified in brain in the 1960s, the recent report in 2003 that a specific 5-HT-4 agonist can overcome opiate-induced respiratory depres- sion without loss of analgesic effect illustrates the high degree of specificity with which brain circuits and recep- tor systems can now be targeted with selective drugs (Manzke et al. , 2003). Some of the major events in our understanding of treatments for depression and anxiety are listed in Table 12.1. The initial serendipitous discovery that ipro- niazid, used in the treatment of tuberculosis, was antide- pressant led to the development of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) as antidepressant treatments. This was followed 4 years later by the discovery that imipramine, which was later found to inhibit monoamine uptake, was also an effective antidepressant. These find- ings led to the monoamine theories of depression in 1963 and 1964, which hypothesized that depression was the result of deficiency of monoamines in brain, and that antidepressants act by increasing synaptic monoamine levels. By 1980 additional drugs that were not effective MAOIs or monoamine uptake inhibitors were found to be effective antidepressants. In addition, MAOIs and monoamine uptake inhibiting drugs produced an imme- diate increase in brain monoamine levels, but clinical antidepressant effects were delayed for 10 to 14 days. This led to the monoamine receptor sensitivity theory of depression, which hypothesized that it was slower changes in brain receptor systems that were important in producing the antidepressant effect and that it was the net increase of 5-HT transmission that was central to antidepressant efficacy. A major advance occurred when the molecular and cellular theory of depression was proposed in 1997. This hypothesis was derived from the observations that anti- depressant treatments (ADTs) result in the sustained activation of the cyclic adenosine 3-5 monophosphate (cAMP) system, which in turn activates the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). This results in increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hippocampus and cortex. Since stress decreases levels of BDNF expression and increases cell atrophy in the dentate gyrus and pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus and this is prevented by chronic (but not acute) administration of all classes of antidepressant treatments, it was hypothesized that the reversal of cellu- lar atrophy by increasing BDNF was a key component of effective antidepressant drug action (Duman et al. , 1997). The more recent findings that a substance P antag- onist was antidepressant and that cytokine therapies such as interferon- α can regularly cause depression broadened the possibilities that depression was not just the result of monoamine abnormalities. It has focused attention on intracellular pathways as the area where both the cause of illness and mechanism of therapy can best be understood (Manji et al. , 2001; Nestler et al. , 2002; Coyle and Duman, 2003). Recently, during the past few years, research has taken advantage of progress in molecular genetics to identify gene variants that relate to various behaviors relevant to depression and anxiety, and there is currently a concerted effort to identify genes of major effect in the cause of these disorders. Problems in Relating Clinical Descriptive Diagnosis to Neuroscience In most areas of medicine, the current predictive and therapeutically relevant diagnostic structure has evolved out of a murky past, and this is the same with depression and anxiety; but in these disorders, the progress of understanding has lagged far behind other areas of med- icine (by some estimates by as much as 50 to 60 years). In part, this slow progress has occurred because it is not clear whether the patient is reporting nonspecific 196 Neuroscience, Molecular Medicine, and New Approaches to the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety Ch12.qxd 9/7/04 9:34 AM Page 196"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"symptoms, has a syndrome, or is manifesting a disease. Clearly, the symptoms of depression and anxiety can be elicited in normally encountered situations (e.g., depres- sive symptoms during loss and grief or anxiety symp- toms when the individual is under threat). Large questions remain as to when depression and anxiety symptom clusters remain stable enough to constitute a syndrome and when the findings are reliable enough to constitute a disease. In contrast to other areas of medi- cine and neurology where more reliable symptoms, signs, and objective laboratory measures are available, the psy- chiatric assessment of depression and anxiety is based only on the history of symptom presentation. Another confounding issue is the large variability in the behavioral repertoire of humans. Throughout the his- tory of psychopharmacology, it has been well known that there is a wide range of behavioral response to all types of psychoactive compounds, ranging from hallu- cinogens, through anxiogenic compounds, to drugs of abuse. These behavioral variations depend on the sub- ject’s history, expectations, and physiological response. Thus, even in experimental laboratories with healthy humans, it has been difficult to predict the wide range of behavioral responses from experimentally administered agents. In patients with depression and anxiety, it has been even more difficult to establish diagnostic categories that will reliably predict drug response. The sole reliance on description for diagnosis in psy- chiatry creates a serious dilemma: Since the descriptively defined diagnostic groups are heterogeneous as to genetic etiology, structural pathology, and pathophysiology, attempts to discover a common neurobiological abnor- mality for any single diagnostic group are doomed to meet with failure. Because of this situation, it has been difficult to build a ladder of progress by sequentially defining sub groups and refining treatments that are more targeted, specific, and efficacious.

Neuroscience and Molecular Medicine The role that modern neuroscience and molecular medicine can play in solving the problems of descriptive diagnosis is illustrated in Figure 12.5. Even though the diagnostic subgroups for anxiety and depression have multiplied in the past 30 years, their specificity in pre- dicting treatment response has not increased proportion- ately. In the model presented in Figure 12.5, each new descriptively described subdivision of the initial heterogeneous diagnostic group includes a second heterogeneous subgroup of patients based on structural abnormalities, pathophysiology, and genetic contribu- tions to the illness. The descriptive separation into sub- groups simply perpetuates the heterogeneity, as no methods are used to stratify it. In contrast, there are many examples from modern molecular medicine where specific genetic, pathophysiological, or structural abnor- malities have served to define important subgroups. This has allowed the development of rational, focused, and specifically directed treatment; and when this has occurred, the treatments have been much more effica- cious. The model presented in Figure 12.5 outlines the role that neuroscience and modern molecular medicine will play in psychiatry. The remaining review attempts to assess how far along we are in applying this model. 198 Neuroscience, Molecular Medicine, and New Approaches to the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety FIGURE 12.5 When the original syndrome was described it contained a heterogeneous group of patients where the cause of illness was either (A) genetic, (B) structural, or (C) pathophysiologic (e.g. and environmental stress, etc.). A descriptive separation of the original syndrome results in 3 new heterogeneous groups that each contain patients with (A) genetic, and (B) structural, and (C) pathophysiologic causes of illness. Thus, when the specific treatments directed at (1) genetic, (2) structural, and (3) pathophysiologic causes are used in each of these 3 new heterogeneous groups, there is low efficacy because the specific treatment is not matched to the cause of illness in a homogenous group of patients—thus only some patients show full recovery. In contrast, with modern molecu- lar medicine where the original syndrome is separated by cause of illness into 3 separate homogenous groups based on (A) genetic, or (B) structural, or (C) pathophysiologic causes, each of the specific treatments can be directed at the correct and homogenous group of patients that results in high efficacy and full recovery in all patients.

Only in the animal models can there be the rigorous experimentation and experimental control required to dissect the biological factors involved in disease production. Obviously, clini- cal studies are also important, as they can validate the disease pathogenesis in humans through careful clinical observation and experimental studies involving symp- tom provocation and treatment. In understanding the pathogenesis of depression and anxiety, there has been more difficulty using animal models than in other med- ical specialties where more simple and valid animal models are available (e.g., stroke, coronary artery dis- ease, renal failure, bone fractures). Many aspects of the presentation of depression and anxiety symptoms are uniquely human. Thus it has been difficult to develop the predictive power of animal models seen in other areas of medicine; however, there has been considerable progress. Animal models of fear as it relates to human anxiety disorder have provided an extremely effective avenue of research. In the area of stress, animal models have been extremely useful in delineating the pathways involved and for discovering preventative or remedial treatment. To a lesser extent animal models of depres- sion that involve impaired escape behaviors such as the forced swim test or learned helplessness have also been useful. The most important aspect of progress has been the robust rise in power and efficiency of neuroscience, neu- ropsychopharmacology, and now molecular medicine. The growth and improvement of neuroscience methods, understanding, and applications have been interactive throughout with neuropsychopharmacology, so at pres- ent the vast majority of even purely physiological studies use some form of neuroactive substances as part of their experimental design. The advent of molecular biology and molecular medicine has increased the opportunities and effectiveness of neurobiological research by orders of magnitude. For example, before 1999 in the field of neu- ropsychiatry, the pathogenesis of narcolepsy was quite vague and confusing. With the discovery through posi- tional cloning of a narcolepsy gene in dogs (a mutation in the hypocretin II receptor), the field experienced an unprecedented leap forward. Today there is a rich matrix of information on the causes and subtypes of narcolepsy involving the hypocretin system and other clinical and genetic variables (Nishino, 2003). In recent years molec- ular neurobiology has been essential for many of the major discoveries that are leading the field forward. These methods are now being applied to the understand- ing of depression and anxiety where a brief survey is described next. Stress and Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone and the Hypothalamic, Pituitary Adrenal Axis Stress has always been thought to play a prominent role in the cause of depression and anxiety, which is related to the widespread view that depression and anxi- ety simply reflect acute and chronic failure of stress related control systems. At the clinical level the hypothe- sis that depression and anxiety are caused by failures in the regulation of the stress-response system has the most data to support it. There are high rates of depression (up to 85%) in Cushing’s disease, which has high circulating cortisol levels, and severely depressed individuals have been shown to excrete abnormally high levels of corti- costeroids and their metabolites. The resistance of plasma cortisol to suppression by the potent synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone has been the basis for a widely used test that has generated a great deal of clini- cal data. Individuals whose cortisol levels are resistant to suppression by dexamethasone have a higher than aver- age rate of relapse, even with apparently effective symp- tomatic treatment. This hypothesis has been extended to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Levels of CRH in the cerebral spinal fluid are elevated in depression. At autopsy, patients have been found to have an increased number of CRH secreting neurons in limbic brain regions and the number of CRH binding sites in frontal cortex is reduced, presumably secondary to increased CRH concentrations. When CRH is infused into depres- sives, they have a blunted adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) response, which suggests a desensitized pitu- itary CRH receptor system. Recently the combined dexa- methasone CRH test has been applied. The CRH elicited ACTH response is blunted in depressives, but dexa- methasone pretreatment produces an opposite effect; compared to control subjects, there is actually an enhanced ACTH release following CRH in the depressed patients. This result is thought to be related to increased numbers of vasopressin-expressing neurons in the parvo- cellular part of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, which has been confirmed on postmortem examination (Holsboer, 2000). Like the dexamethasone test, the dexamethasone- CRH test has shown that normalization of the CRH– hypothalamic, pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is necessary for full clinical remission. Patients showing abnormalities in the test at the time of hospital discharge have a high propensity to relapse. The combined dexamethasone- CRH test is also able to differentiate healthy individuals Neuroscience, Molecular Medicine, and New Approaches to the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety 199 Ch12.qxd 9/7/04 9:34 AM Page 199"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"who are at high risk for developing depression from healthy control subjects. In Figure 12.6, it can be seen that the healthy individuals who have a family history of depression but who have not yet developed depression, have a dexamethasone-CRH test intermediate between the healthy individuals from families with no history of depression and depressed patients. This finding suggests that there is an abnormality in the corticosteroid receptor signaling pathways involving the regulation of the HPA axis in individuals vulnerable to depression (Holsboer, 2000). Current research using molecular methods to manip- ulate the status of the various corticosteroid regulatory receptor systems has produced promising leads, but they have not been validated in clinical populations (Holsboer, 2000). The clinical relevance of abnormalities in the CRH-HPA axis is highlighted by the finding that the dexamethasone-CRH test produces higher cortisol concentrations in patients with multiple sclerosis. Those patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis had the least abnormality, intermediate were patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, and the most marked abnormality was seen in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis. The HPA axis abnormality correlated with neurological disability but not with evaluations of depressed mood (Then Bergh et al. , 1999). Abnormalities in the CRH-HPA system have also been found in anxiety disorders where there is evidence for CRH overdrive and negative glucocorticoid feedback in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Kellner, et al. , 2000). Even though abnormalities in HPA axis regulation are present in depression and anxiety, and it is clear that this is an important part of these syn- dromes, it remains to be shown that these abnormalities are the primary cause of the disorder rather than a sec- ondary consequence of dysregulation in other systems. The Molecular and Cellular Theory of Depression Since this hypothesis was proposed (Duman et al. , 1997), there have been extensive additional data that sup- port and extend the idea that factors influencing neuro- plasticity, neurogenesis, and cell survival are critical in the pathogenesis and treatment of depression. Currently, this theory offers the most promise for understanding the cause and treatment of depression. In addition to the monoamine-cAMP-CREB pathway, additional path- ways have been delineated that could be related to the cause of mood disorders and subserve the mechanism of action of drugs used to treat them. The initial observations—that stress decreased neuro- genesis in the hippocampus and that this was reversed by antidepressant treatment—have been extended by the finding that several different classes of antidepressants increase hippocampal neurogenesis after chronic but not after acute treatment (Malberg et al. , 2000). This finding is consistent with the clinical data, which show that chronic but not acute treatment is effective. In addition, studies have shown that antidepressant treatment increases the proliferation of hippocampal cells and that these new cells mature and become neurons. Studies have shown that newly generated cells in hippocampus display passive membrane properties, action potentials, and functional synaptic inputs similar to those found in mature dentate granular cells (van Praag et al. , 2002). In addition, there is evidence that a subgroup, approxi- mately 14% of newly generated neurons in an adult rat, become γ -aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) basket cells that are capable of forming inhibitory synapses with principal excitatory granular cells (Liu et al. , 2003). This demonstrates that in hippocampus, neurogenesis can 200 Neuroscience, Molecular Medicine, and New Approaches to the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety 35 75 24 50 100 150 200 250 Number Subjects Healthy Controls Healthy High Risk Probands Major Depressive Episode Cortisol at 16:00 hrs (n mole/L) FIGURE 12.6 Healthy individuals with high risk for depression have an elevated cortisol response to the combined dexamethasone-CRH test.

It has been shown that disrupting hip- pocampal neurogenesis blocks the behavioral responses to antidepressants (Santarelli et al. , 2003). In addition, this work provides important new data on differences between antidepressants. Mice with the 5-HT 1A recep- tor knocked out were insensitive to the neurogenic and behavioral effects of the SSRI fluoxetine, but the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine, which can act via the norad- renergic system, did produce neurogenesis and behavioral effects in the 5-HT-1A knock out mice. X-irradiation of the hippocampus prevented the neurogenic and behav- ioral effects of both types of antidepressants. It is of major interest that early maternal deprivation reduces the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus of adult rats. After 24 hours of maternal separation on postnatal day 9, rats studied at postnatal day 72 had reduced BDNF expression and an altered BDNF response to stress (Roceri et al. , 2002). In rat pups under- going maternal separation, treatment with fluoxetine prevents the separation-induced decrease in neurogenesis (Lee et al. , 2001). Because early life stress is a docu- mented risk factor for the development of affective dis- orders, it is of further interest that prenatal restraint stress of the mother on day 18 after mating reduces the number of granule cells in hippocampus of female but not male offspring when they were 75 days old (Schmitz et al. , 2002). This has considerable relevance for a possi- ble explanation for the 1.5 to 3 times more frequent occurrence of depression in women than in men. The idea that BDNF is a target for antidepressant drug action has clinical support in that BDNF expres- sion in dentate gyrus, hilus, and super granular regions was higher in humans treated with antidepressant med- ications at the time of their death compared to subjects not treated with antidepressants (Chen et al. , 2001). Extensive imaging studies of mood disorders have revealed structural brain changes within a neuroanatom- ical circuit termed the limbic-cortico-striatal-pallidal- thalamic tract (Sheline, 2003). The imaging studies are also supported by a series of postmortem studies where major depressive disorder and bipolar illness are charac- terized by alterations in the density and size of neuronal and glial cells in limbic brain regions (Rajkowska, 2003). In addition to the increased BDNF expression observed at postmortem in patients treated with antidepressants, another powerful line of evidence supporting the hypoth- esis is that in depressed patients, reduced hippocampal volume can be related to the number of days of untreated depression (Sheline et al. , 2003). This is strong but indi- rect evidence that antidepressant treatment increases hip- pocampal volume, presumably through neurogenesis. Since lithium treatment is reported to increase human brain gray matter (Moore et al. , 2000), other mechanisms other than neurogenesis in hippocampus may also be involved. Several pathways are involved in increasing neuroplas- ticity, neurogenesis, and survival. In Table 12.2, four of the pathways that are known to be effected by treatments for mood disorders are illustrated. Antidepressants, ECT, lithium, valproic acid, carbamazapine, and lamotrigine, all of which have proven to be effective in the treatment of mood disorders, have effects on the pathways that increase neuroplasticity, neurogenesis, and cell survival (Coyle and Duman, 2003). It is of interest that drugs that have such different pharmacologic profiles overlap in this manner. Extensive cross talk and interaction between the pathways may account for the lack of specificity seen in the disorder and the widely different but effective treatments. There have been a wide number of family twin and other genetic studies of depression and bipolar illness, and it is of interest that mutations in the area surround- ing the BDNF gene have been identified as associated with bipolar disorder (Sklar et al. , 2002). The role of the cAMP signaling pathway in mood disorders is strength- ened by the finding that variations in CREB1 cosegregate with depression in women (Zubenko et al. , 2003). Another recent report is that 10% of bipolar disorder cases have a polymorphism in the G protein receptor kinase 3 (Barrett et al. , 2003). Studies such as these will need to be replicated, but they offer considerable promise for the identification of patient subgroups that could be targeted with specific treatments. Neuroimmune Pathways in Depression Another line of evidence for heterogeneity in the path- ways leading to depression involves the immune system. For the past several years it has been known that treatment with interferon- α and interleukin 2-based immunotherapy is regularly accompanied by increased depression, reaching clinical levels in up to 50% of patients. Figure 12.7 illustrates the change in depres- sion ratings after 4 weeks of interferon- α treatment in 10 patients. All but one patient had an increase in depres- sion during treatment, and the increase was greater in those patients who had higher baseline ratings before treatment (Capuron and Ravaud, 1999). The initial injec- tion of interferon- α produces an increase in cortisol and ACTH in all patients, but those patients with the high- est increase of both cortisol and ACTH are the ones who develop clinical depression later in treatment (Figure 12.8) (Capuron et al. , 2003). Interferon- α has been found to lower serum dipeptidyl peptidase IV activ- ity, which is proportional to the increase in depressive and anxiety symptoms seen with interferon- α treatment. It is also related to the immune activation (Maes et al. , 2001). Immune activation is also associated with a Neuroscience, Molecular Medicine, and New Approaches to the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety 201 Ch12.qxd 9/7/04 9:34 AM Page 201"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"decrease in serum tryptophan, the concentration of which relates to the increased depressive symptoms (Capuron et al. , 2002a). Depression after interferon- α treatment can be prevented by treatment with the SSRI paroxetine. It is of interest that the paroxetine treatment prevented the development of depressive symptoms and cognitive symptoms, but it had much less of an effect on the neurovegetative symptoms such as abnormal appetite, abnormal sleep, fatigue, psychomotor retar- dation, pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and bowel problems (Capuron et al. , 2002b). Neuropeptides in Depression Although initially antidepressants were thought to work solely through the monoamine systems, there is now evidence that neuropeptides are also involved and that neuropeptide antagonists can be antidepressant. In an initial study, a substance P antagonist was more effec- tive than placebo and equally effective as paroxetine in reducing depressive symptoms (Kramer et al. , 1998). A second clinical study of a substance P antagonist as a treatment for depression has also shown similar efficacy to paroxetine. In a study of 23 depressed patients where substance P was measured before and after antidepres- sant treatment, mean substance P levels in serum were higher than in control subjects before treatment. Although in the patients there was no overall change in mean substance P levels between baseline and 4-weeks of treatment, there was a correlation. Approximately one third of the patients who had a decrease in substance P during treatment had a better drug response that those with an increase (Bondy et al. , 2003). The infusion of substance P into healthy volunteers is reported to produce a small but reliable worsening of mood. Clinical findings have been given additional support from studies in mice where the Tac-1 gene that encodes 202 Neuroscience, Molecular Medicine, and New Approaches to the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety FIGURE 12.7 Inteferon- α increases depression.

The Tac-1–deficient mice were more active in the porsolt swim test and did not become hyperactive after bulbectomy, thus demonstrating a resistance to depression-like effects. In addition, they were less fearful in several models of anxiety (Bilkei-Gorzo et al. , 2002). These findings demonstrate that tachykinins are power- ful mediators of depression-like or anxiety-like behavior in mice and support the continued development of sub- stance P antagonist as treatments. In addition, neuropep- tide Y has been implicated as having antidepressant actions in an animal model by acting through the NPY Y-1 receptor subtype (Redrobe et al. , 2002). Neurobiology of Anxiety Progress in understanding the neurobiological patho- genesis of anxiety has been greater than in any other diagnostic category in psychiatry. This is primarily due to the major advances in the use of animals models, which has allowed the discovery of the neuropathways subserv- ing conditioned fear and the neurobiological factors sub- serving anxiety-like behavior. At the clinical level there is a great deal of ambiguity regarding the diagnosis of anx- iety disorder in patients (i.e., terms and concepts put for- ward to describe anxiety disorders range from anxiety neurosis and anxiety hysteria to street fear and soldiers heart to conditions like autonomic epilepsy and vasomo- tor neurosis). The current DSM IV diagnostic system has improved this, but problems still remain. Anxiety symp- toms accompany a large range of other medical illnesses including cardiac arrhythmias, hypothyroidism, anaphy- laxis, asthma, seizure disorders, and after intoxication with or withdrawal from numerous drugs. The use of benzodiazepines and antidepressants and the develop- ment of more reliable behavioral therapies now make treatment of anxiety disorders the most effective in the field of psychiatry. Stress has always been seen as a central factor in the production of fear and anxiety, and the discovery and use of specific CRH agonists and antagonists have vali- dated this idea. CRH agonists have been found to pro- duce a variety of fear and anxiety-like behaviors, and all of these effects can be reduced or abolished by centrally administered CRH antagonists. CRH receptor-deficient mice have impaired spatial recognition memory but also demonstrate decreased anxiety-like behaviors (Contarino et al. , 1999). This finding is consistent with the anxio- genic effect of CRH. It is of interest that conditional mutagenesis of the glucocorticoid receptor produced the expected impairment of HPA axis regulation but also produced impaired behavioral response to stress and reduced anxiety (Tronche et al. , 1999). Thus, the data support the idea that the CRH-HPA axis not only pro- vides a response to fear and anxiety but also plays a role in initiating and maintaining these states. Some of the most significant advances in the field have derived from the discovery of neuroautonomic cir- cuits subserving conditioned fear. Figure 12.9 outlines auditory fear conditioned pathways. The basal lateral nucleus of the amygdala plays a central role in integrat- ing auditory input and in sending information to the cen- tral nucleus of the amygdala, which orchestrates the behavioral, autonomic, and endocrine outputs.

The cortex is also involved. It has been shown that dam- age to the dorsal part of the medial prefrontal cortex enhances fear to a conditioned tone. Prefrontal neurons reduce their spontaneous activity in the presence of a conditioned aversive tone as a function of the degree of fear, and this is related to amygdala activity, indicating that the amygdala controls both fear expression and pre- frontal neuronal activity (Garcia et al. , 1999). This rela- tionship is reciprocal; the medial prefrontal cortex is involved in the formation of new memories that extin- guish prior conditioning. The new extinction memories stored in the medial prefrontal cortex inhibit fearful memories that most likely reside in subcortical structures (Milad and Quirk, 2002). This fits with the data that extinction does not erase conditioning but instead forms a new memory that supercedes it. The delineation of fear circuits has facilitated the discovery of new molecular mechanisms involved in fear-related memory. Receptors for gastrin-releasing peptide have been found on GABA interneurons of the lateral nucleus of the amygdala. When the gastrin-releasing peptide is deficient, mice demonstrate more long-term fear memory (Shumyatsky et al. , 2002). Similarly, it has been shown that endoge- nous cannabinoids are also involved in the extinction of long-term fear memory; knock out of the cannabinoid 1 receptor and an antagonist of this receptor impairs short- and long-term extinction of fear conditioning (Marsicano et al. , 2002). Benzodiazepines, which modulate the GABA recep- tor, are widely used in the treatment of panic and anxiety disorders. In patients suffering from panic attacks, a deficit of GABAa receptors has been identified in brain using imaging studies. These data indicate that variations in GABAa receptor subtype composition within patients could be a contributor to the lower threshold for anxiety seen in these individuals. These fine differences in the GABAa subtypes may provide an advantage in the design of new therapeutic agents. Along this line, it has been found that mice with mutation in the α -1 type GABAa receptor demonstrated anxiolytic, myorelaxant, motor impairing, and ethanol potentiating effects of drugs acting on the receptor while the sedative, amnestic, and some of the anticonvulsant effects were abolished (Rudolph et al. , 1999). Another dimension of the GABAa system is its inter- action with neurosteroids.

Pathways thought to be involved in emotional learning involve extraleminiscal pathways, which project to the medial division of the medial geniculate nucleus, and the posterior intralaminar nucleus, which project to pri- mary auditory cortex, auditory association cortex, and the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, which also receives inputs via the auditory association and polymodal association cortex. The basolateral nucleus projects to the central nucleus of the amygdala, a major output of the amygdala, which projects to brain areas that produce the behavioral, autonomic, and endocrine manifestations of fear. The central nucleus also feeds back to the cortex via the nucleus basalis. Leminiscal Pathway Medial Geniculate N.

When panic attacks were induced in patients with panic disorder with sodium lac- tate and choleystokinin, patients had pronounced decreases in the neurosteroids that were GABAa agonists and an increase in the concentrations of the functional antagonists. Similar changes were not seen in control subjects (Strohle et al. , 2003). These investigations illus- trate the opportunities for neurochemical dissection of the factors controlling the low threshold for panic attacks in patients with panic disorder. Improved animal models have allowed investigation of the developmental aspects of anxiety disorders. It is known that maternal separation increases hypothalamic CRH gene expression, HPA activity, and behavioral responses to stress in adult animals. Environmental enrichment during the peripubertal period reverses the effects of maternal separation on HPA and behavioral responses but does not effect CRH-mRNA expression in adult animals (Francis et al. , 2002). This finding has implications for treatment, as it demonstrates in this model that the functional behavioral effects can be modified while the fundamental neurobiological defect remains unchanged. Mice lacking the 5HT 1-A receptor have increased anxiety-like behavior, but it has been shown using a tissue-specific conditional rescue strategy that receptor expression during early postnatal period, but not in the adult, is necessary to rescue the increased anxiety-like behavior (Gross et al. , 2002). Findings like this demonstrate that the postnatal processes are impor- tant in establishing anxiety-like behavior and that there may be different functions and consequences of these receptor systems throughout development. Development is important as it relates to critical issues in genetic vulnerability of humans to stress and the man- ifestation of anxiety disorders. The initial findings demonstrating that humans with PTSD have reduced hippocampal volume fit nicely with the hypothesis that the reduced volume was secondary to stress-induced atrophy. However, in a pivotal study, monozygotic twins who were discordant for trauma exposure had smaller hippocampi than control subjects (Figure 12.10) (Gilbertson et al. , 2002). Figure 12.11 illustrates that the severity of the PTSD in the exposed twin correlated with the decrease in that twin’s own hippocampal size; how- ever, the same intensity of exposure correlated with the decreased hippocampal size in the brother who was never exposed. This points to critical developmental factors in the predisposition to develop PTSD. The rich matrix of findings from preclinical and clini- cal studies now offers many opportunities for develop- ment of new and more specific treatments for anxiety disorders. Since conditioned fear in laboratory animals and human PTSD share many of the same mechanisms, application of the preclinical information should result in improved treatments for patients.

The promoter activity for the 5-HTT gene is located on 17q 11.2. and is modified by sequence elements within the proximal 5 ′ regulatory region. This is designated the 5-HTT gene linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR). The short allele has been associated with lower transcriptional effi- ciency and reduced 5HT transport compared to the long allele. It has been shown through a series of studies that reducing plasma tryptophan reduces brain serotonin lev- els. When this test is applied to depressed patients recently recovered on treatment, there has been a brief increase in depressive symptoms. In Figure 12.12 the left panel illustrates that when serotonin is depleted when using the tryptophan depletion test, there was a larger increase in depressed ratings in patients treated with SSRIs than in patients treated with catecholamine uptake inhibitors (Delgado et al. , 1999). In contrast, (right panel) when recently recovered depressed patients were given the catecholamine depleting drug, alpha methyl paratyrosine, patients on catecholamine uptake inhibitors had a higher depression score, and little effect was seen in patients treated with SSRIs (Miller et al. , 1996). Symptom relapse was specific to the type of anti- depressant treatment and the catecholamine system impaired. Since antidepressant treatment with SSRIs or catecholamine uptake inhibitors appears equally effica- cious in depressed patients, the specificity illustrated in Figure 12.12 was not easily explained. Now it appears that the 5HT pathway and the catecholamine pathway involve separate mechanisms that both increase neurogen- esis in the hippocampus. The 5HT 1A knockout mice did not showed neurogenesis when treated with a cate- cholamine uptake inhibitor, but not an SSRI (Santarelli et al ., 2003). In addition, it has now been found that symptom increase after serotonin depletion has a genetic basis. Nondepressed healthy women were given a trypto- phan depletion test and patients with the l/l allele showed little effect. Patients with the s/s allele showed the largest increase in depressive symptoms and patients with l/s 206 Neuroscience, Molecular Medicine, and New Approaches to the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety FIGURE 12.11 A: Reduced hippocampal volume correlates with increased PTSD severity in the monozygotic twins exposed to combat.

Thus, in this instance, findings from the use of 5HT 1A knockout mice and the findings of the genetic contribution to a clinically useful provoca- tive test have added new understanding as to the possible mechanisms of antidepressant action. In contrast to studies where the 5HT polymorphism has been inconsistently associated with different diag- nostic groups of patients, recent studies of genetic and environmental interactions have been much more inform- ative. In a unique initial cohort of 1037 children who have been monitored until age 26 years, it has been possible to relate the number of stressful life events occurring after their twenty-first birthday to depression at age 26. Figure 12.14 shows that the s/s genotype has almost a doubling of probability of major depression over the l/l genotype. In addition, when childhood maltreatment and the occurrence of depression are examined in these individu- als, it can be seen (Figure 12.15) that the s/s genotype had again an approximately doubling of depression com- pared to the l/l genotype (Caspi et al. , 2003).

This is one of the best studies to illustrate the fundamentally important concept, that the interaction of the genotype with the environment generates the clinical syndrome. The use of these genetic methods may have clinical applications (Figure 12.16) where patients with Parkinson’s disease (which is known to be associated with depression) with the s/s genotype had more than four times the percentage of depression than individuals with the l/l genotype (Mossner et al. 2001). Taken together, the data suggest that the l/l-s/s polymorphisms reflect important neurobi- ological processes that are not directly associated with diagnosis but do interact in important ways with envi- ronmental contingencies to influence disease expression. NEUROSCIENCE AND CURRENT TREATMENTS Monoamines Imipramine was discovered to be an effective antide- pressant more than 40 years ago, and no new drugs have been developed to demonstrate unequivocal superior effi- cacy. The development of large numbers of drugs, with varying degrees of specificity in blocking monoamine uptake and antagonism of various monoamine receptor subtypes, has resulted in considerable differences in side effect profiles. At the present time the physician’s choice of the drug’s side effect profile primarily determines which drug treatment is used. In this regard, the SSRIs are widely prescribed because of their relative lack of side effects compared to the older trycyclic drugs. There have been inconsistent data regarding whether different antidepressants are more efficacious in different patient subgroups; however, there are consistent data to show that psychotic depression requires the addition of a neu- roeleptic in addition to standard antidepressant treat- ment. Atypical depression may respond better to monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase have been developed that do not carry some of the side effect liabilities of the older drugs. Overall, there has been no major shift in the paradigm of monoamine uptake inhibitors or monoamine oxidase inhibitors as treatments, although there has been a mas- sive effort by the pharmaceutical industry to improve side effect profiles. A wide range of compounds has been used to augment the antidepressant response in treat- ment nonresponders. These include the use of lithium, thyroid, and neuroleptics, especially respiridone. 208 Neuroscience, Molecular Medicine, and New Approaches to the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety FIGURE 12.14 Stressful life events produce depression in genetically vulnerable individuals.

The advent of transcranial magnetic stimulation has shown some antidepressant efficacy, but it has yet to find a main role in common clin- ical practice. For patients very resistant to treatment, vagal nerve stimulation has been used, but with only par- tial improvements. One area where practice has improved is the use of antidepressants in patients with comorbid illness. With the use of SSRIs and their reduced number of cardiovas- cular side effects, it is now possible to engage in active treatment in patients with cardiac disease and depres- sion. In a recent study of behavioral intervention that improved psychosocial function and depressive symp- toms, behavioral treatment did not impact on cardiovas- cular mortality (Writing Committee, 2003). However, emerging data show that treatment with SSRIs can help reduce mortality in cardiovascular disease, especially with the use of paroxetine (Sauer et al. , 2003). It is important to note that up to 50% of antidepres- sant trials are failures, as the rate of improvement of patients on the test drug is not significantly different than the rate of patients on placebo. This indicates that there is large opportunity for further progress. CRH and the HPA Axis A number of CRH antagonists have been under devel- opment, and in many animal models they show clear antidepressant and antianxiety efficacy. In one of the first clinical studies, a human CRH-1 receptor antagonist was studied in 24 patients with a dose ranging study. Significant reductions in depression and anxiety scores were observed, with some worsening of affective symptom- atology after drug discontinuation (Zobel et al. , 2000). This result supports the principle that a CRH-1 antago- nist could be a new type of antidepressant and anxiolytic treatment. A study of mifepristone (a corticosteroid antagonist) in psychotic depression was conducted in 30 patients. A placebo control was not used, and when the high-dose group was compared to the low-dose group, 68% met the criterion of a 30% or greater decline in the depression rating scale, whereas only 36% of the low-dose group met this threshold. Although results were not statistically sig- nificant, the number of subjects was small, and if that number were doubled at the same rate of improvement, statistically significant results would have been observed (Belanoff et al. , 2002). Excitatory and Inhibitory Neurotransmission A large number of clinical trials have investigated the use of GABA agonists in the treatment of depression. These drugs have shown some partial efficacy, but as yet they have not demonstrated superior efficacy over the standard tricyclic or SSRI treatments. Studies have shown that GABA levels in the occipital lobe of depressed patients are lower in some patient groups and that this increases to normal levels with effective treat- ment. The most promising studies appear to be related to the NMDA receptor system. In preclinical studies, mod- ulators of the glycine side on this receptor were highly correlated to antidepressant-like effects on a wide range of animal models. It is of considerable interest that the NMDA antagonist ketamine is an antidepressant. When a single dose was administered intravenously to depressed patients, beginning at 4 hours and extending to 72 hours, there was a clear antidepressant response, reaching a drop of 13 points on the Hamilton rating scale at 72 hours (Berman et al. , 2000). Behavioral Treatments As opposed to the pharmacological treatments, with behavioral treatments it has been extremely difficult or impossible to identify the active therapeutic factor and to quantify its dosage and ensure its administration; how- ever, there have been major advances in this field over the Neuroscience, Molecular Medicine, and New Approaches to the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety 209 FIGURE 12.16 Reduced function of serotonin transporter gene is associated with increased depression in individuals with Parkinson’s disease.

At the present time, therapists follow man- uals and receive reliability training so there is increas- ing assurance that the expected behavioral treatment is actually being delivered. When cognitive behavioral therapy and antidepressant therapy are used in combination, some advantages have emerged. However, in the treatment of panic disorder, even though there is an advantage of the combined treat- ment over cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) alone at the end of treatment, there was a greater relapse in the combined group at follow-up evaluation (Foa et al. , 2002). Thus, there are some data to indicate that the pharmaceutical therapy and CBT may address quite dif- ferent aspects of cerebral function and that, depending on the specific circumstances, this may be synergistic or antagonistic. Behavioral therapies have special indications where pharmacotherapy is questioned, such as in pregnancy. Up to 20% of pregnant women can have elevated depres- sive symptoms, and a trial in interpersonal psychother- apy in this patient group has shown that up to 60% of women can meet recovery criteria, which is significantly better than a parenting educational control program (Spinnelli and Endicott, 2003). Psychother apy treatments may also be useful in situations where pharmacotherapy is not available. A well-controlled trial of group interper- sonal therapy in rural Uganda showed markedly greater antidepressant effect in the interpersonal therapy group than the control group (i.e., a reduction of 17 vs 3 points, respectively, in the measure of the severity of depression) (Bolton et al. , 2003). The role of exercise in the treatment of depression has been of considerable interest. A number of pre- clinical studies demonstrate that increased motor activity in rodents is related to an increase in BDNF in hippocampus. In a study of depressed individuals over age 50 who were randomly assigned to a 4-month course of aerobic exercise, sertraline therapy, or a com- bination of exercise and sertraline, at the end of the treatment protocol, all three groups exhibited signifi- cant improvement and the proportion of individuals who met remission criteria was comparable across the treatment conditions. However, at follow-up evaluation after 10 months, subjects in the exercise group had sig- nificantly lower relapse rates than subjects in the med- ication group (Babyak et al. , 2000). In Figure 12.17 it can be seen that the percentage of patients at 10 months who were continuing to exercise was about the 210 Neuroscience, Molecular Medicine, and New Approaches to the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety FIGURE 12.17 Exercise treatment alone results in lower rates of depression at 10 months after initial treatment with exercise, sertraline, or the combination.

As delineated previously, the animal models for PTSD are the most congruent to human anxiety disorders, as conditioned fear in animals and PTSD fear in humans demonstrate many symptomatic and other characteristic similarities. It is of interest in this regard that some of the behavioral treatments for PTSD have been found to be quite efficacious. In a study of sixth grade students who were exposed to violence and had clinical levels of PTSD, those who had a 10-session course of standardized cog- nitive behavioral therapy had lower symptom scores than the control group (8.9 vs 15.5, respectively) (Stein et al. , 2003). Other treatments of PTSD in adults have shown that exposure and cognitive restructuring are effective in reducing symptoms and that they are better than relaxation. The behavioral treatment literature has little specific data from animal models to design treatment. However, our current understanding of the mechanisms that pro- duce conditioned fear may now be applied to improve the treatment of PTSD. In particular, exposure therapy to stimuli that are identical to the original trauma could be used to facilitate extinction of traumatic memories. Individuals in Turkey who had PTSD consequent to an earthquake, when given 1 hour of extinction treatment in an earthquake simulator (which was similar to the original trauma), showed significant improvement most evident during the subsequent 4 weeks (Figure 12.18) (Basoglu et al. , 2003). The high order of cognitive abilities of humans com- pared to other laboratory animals is both an advantage and disadvantage when developing behavioral treatments for depression and anxiety. The advantages are that these capacities can be used to discriminate between threaten- ing and nonthreatening situations, increase control, avoid symptoms, and generate adaptations and alternative cop- ing strategies. The disadvantage can be that these cogni- tive elements, if uncontrolled, can negate or allow escape from some of the behavioral interventions. As under- standing of the molecular, cellular, and physiological control of depressive and anxiety behaviors improves it would be expected that the animal models may be used to build a foundation and framework for human studies. Because of the high order of cognitive processing in Neuroscience, Molecular Medicine, and New Approaches to the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety 211 FIGURE 12.18 A single session of extinction training reduces PTSD symptoms in earthquake survivors.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS Diagnostic Specificity The reliance on descriptive diagnosis is expected to remain in place until practical and trustworthy alterna- tives are demonstrated. As in other areas of medicine (e.g., diabetes, epilepsy), the clinical diagnostic categories lag far behind our understanding of the specific avenues of pathogenesis. It is hoped that there will be an increas- ing acceptance of the diffuseness of the disorders and acceptance of the graded and blurred boundaries between symptoms, syndromes, and diseases. It is clear no single lesion will be discovered for any diagnostic group. As in other areas of medicine, multiple pathways of pathogenesis will be delineated and their relationship to clinical manifestations will become more clear. Neuroscience and Molecular Medicine Understanding of the mechanisms of brain function and specific influences of genetic variations on behavior will continue to improve. In particular, the opportunity to identify specific genetic abnormalities in families and then correlate the behavioral and clinical manifestations of illness to this abnormality will shed a new perspective on pathogenesis and diagnosis of anxiety and depres- sion. A major influence will be the role of the genetic abnormalities as risk factors and a high emphasis on environmental interactions. Even today the short and long alleles of the 5-HT transporter can be used in deal- ing with the causes and treatment interventions for 212 Neuroscience, Molecular Medicine, and New Approaches to the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety FIGURE 12.19 Estrogen treatment for postpartum depression in 23 women.

Clinicians will need a much more far-ranging concept of disease pathogenesis. They will need to come to grips with the power of the envi- ronmental interaction given the particular genetic vulnerabilities of individuals. An Example from Obstetrics At the descriptive level, a great deal has been written about postpartum depression, its existence, causes, and possible treatments. The data in Figure 12.19 present a striking result. Replacement of estrogen deficiency in women presenting with postpartum psychosis produces an 83% remission rate in 2 weeks, with 100% remission rate by 8 weeks (Ahokas et al. , 2001). This finding illus- trates three points: (1) A behavioral diagnosis missed the etiological variable; (2) when the etiological variable was directly corrected, a complete recovery was obtained; (3) the pathogenesis within the diagnostic subgroup needs to be homogeneous and exactly corrected by the treatment. In this group of women homogeneous for estrogen deficiency, the result of estrogen replacement was total recovery in 100% of patients. Long-Term Future With the advances stemming from neurosciences and molecular medicine, it is expected that the specificity of diagnosis relative to pathogenic pathways will be increasingly congruent. Thus treatments will be directed at the cause of illness and will thereby be much more effective. There is no reason to expect that the high preva- lence and destructive disability of depressive and anxiety disorders will remain at its current level if this formula can be effected. On the contrary, it is probable that these disorders will be more effectively and more frequently treated in the future. References Ahokas A, et al . (2000).

The last century of progress in genetics has been impressive. The word gene was first used in the early 1900s by William Bateson. The discovery that chromosomes con- tained the genetic material occurred in the next decade in Thomas Hunt Morgan’s laboratory and firmly estab- lished the fruit fly as a model organism in genetics. The structure of DNA was solved by Watson and Crick in 1953 about three decades later. Now scientists have essen- tially sequenced the entire human and mouse genomes, in addition to other invertebrates, and the chimpanzee is close behind (Adams et al. , 2000; Lander et al. , 2001; Venter et al. , 2001; Waterston et al. , 2002; Wolfsberg et al. , 2002). All of this, less than 50 years after the structure of DNA was first published. Although knowledge of the human and other genomes provides an important road map, we still have a long way to go to translate this windfall into new therapeutics. Thus far, the field of neurogenetics has had most of its success in finding genes for relatively rare conditions with mendelian inheritance. This is not to diminish these sem- inal contributions, as finding these genes has already led to major advances in our understanding of several com- mon neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (Tanzi and Bertram, 2001), Parkinson’s disease, and fron- totemporal dementia (Clark et al. , 1998; Hong et al. , 1998), as well as rarer conditions such as the triplet repeat diseases (Paulson and Fischbeck, 1996; Rosenberg, 1996; Paulson, 2000; Taylor et al. , 2002). Several of these genetic discoveries have already led to therapeutic clinical trials. We are now beginning to understand how genes contribute to normal human development and individual variability in common disease susceptibility, and cognitive and behavioral phenotypes. The ability to study individual genes afforded by advances in molecular biology and genetics that have so propelled our knowledge of neuronal development and functioning over the last two decades has also contributed to an increasing gap between molecular and systems neu- roscientists. How do we move from the individual gene to an understanding of brain function or dysfunction at a systems level? In addition, how do we reconcile the classic, hypothesis driven, neurobiological approach with the dis- covery-based methodology on which most modern genetic research is based? Knowledge of the genome sequence of humans and experimental animals invites us to use this genome knowledge and attempt to integrate it with our knowledge of the neural systems that underlie disease. To do so, we must be ready to accept research methods that rely primarily on large-scale discovery, rather than the more standard approach of testing one hypothesis at a time (Geschwind, 2000; Lockhart and Barlow, 2001; Mirnics et al. , 2001; Geschwind and Gregg, 2002). This chapter emphasizes two such methods, gene expression analysis with DNA microarrays and proteomics. GENOMICS Why Gene Expression? About 1% to 2% of the human genome codes for expressed genes, or messenger RNA (mRNA), which is sub- sequently translated into protein within cells (Figure 13.1). 217 CHAPTER 13 Genomics, Proteomics, and Neurology Lorelei D. Shoemaker Daniel H. Geschwind, MD, PhD Ch13.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 217"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"218 Genomics, Proteomics, and Neurology Estimates based on bioinforma tics and expr essed seq uence tags suggested that there are about 30,000 genes in the human genome, about twice that in the fruit fly (Adams et al. , 2000; Venter et al. , 2001). Given this modest increase in the number of expressed genes vs an almost exponential rise in organismal complexity from drosophila to human, it is clear that it is the regulation of genes through the tim- ing and levels of expression and alternative splicing of these genes that underlie cellular homeostasis and signal- ing within the nervous system. Therefore, to understand the role of genes in development, functioning, and diseases of the nervous system, we need to be able to measure the dynamic patterns of gene expression within specific brain regions and cell types. To perform this task efficiently requires methods allowing study of the expression pat- terns of large numbers of genes (mRNA) and their regu- lation at the translational (protein) and posttranslational level (e.g., protein phosphorylation or glycosylation). Microarrays permit tour de force monitoring of the entire transcriptome (all mRNAs in a cell) of a given neuronal or glial cell or brain region. Rapidly evolving proteomics techniques, such as mass spectrometry (MS) coupled to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE) permit simi- lar assessment of the proteome (all proteins in a cell). These and other methods focusing on different levels, from gene to RNA to protein, and their relationships are depicted in Figure 13.1. Microarrays and proteomic tech- niques provide a striking improvement in power and throughput over conventional techniques such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and Northern or Western blotting, which allow the simultane- ous assessment of only single or small groups of genes and proteins. DNA Microarrays DNA microarrays, also referred to as gene chips, are composed of DNA attached to a solid surface in an ordered fashion at high density (Schena et al. , 1995; Lipshutz et al. , 1999). About half of the genome can be arrayed on a surface the size of a glass microscope slide or other similar surface, such as a silicon wafer or mirror. Each spot on the array is a distinct DNA species that provides a specific target for a hybridization experiment. In a typical microarray experiment, one wants to mea- sure the amount of a given mRNA species in a specific brain region or cell type. As there are thousands of gene spots on each array, all can be queried in a single hybridization step because of two basic principles of nucleic acid hybridization: (1) DNA and RNA bind specifically to their complementary sequence due to Watson-Crick base pairing, and (2) binding will occur in proportion to the nucleic acid species abundance in a mixture. The more abundant a given mRNA (or cDNA) is in a cell or tissue, the more binding to its complement on the array will occur. Thus, by hybridizing the array with mRNA or its more stable counterpart, cDNA, from a region or cell of interest, one gets a reading of the abundance of every gene represented on an array in the hybridized sample. The availability of microarray sets containing more than 80% of the genes in the genome of interest makes it conceivable to identify all of the impor- tant target disease-causing genes in a few hybridization steps (Lipshutz et al. , 1999; Lockhart and Winzeler, 2000; Geschwind and Gregg, 2002). Array Platforms Currently there are two major array formats, oligonu- cleotide arrays and cDNA arrays (Schena et al. , 1995; Lipshutz et al. , 1999; Lockhart and Winzeler, 2000; Luo and Geschwind, 2001; Geschwind and Gregg, 2002). Price, availability, and the presence of genes of interest are reasonable criteria to apply when choosing between these platforms. As more comparative performance data become available, this additional factor can be considered Genome Sequence Gene dosage Chromatin structure Epigenetic modification Transcriptome mRNA concentrations mRNA localisation Proteome Protein abundance Post-translational modification Protein–protein interactions AAAAA AAA AAAAAAA FIGURE 13.1 Levels of biological system understanding from genome to the proteome. Neurological disease can be studied at each level, all of which should be considered to develop appropriately targeted therapeutics. This chapter focuses on how we can assess the functional consequences arising from the genome or the interactions of the genome and the environment in a high throughput manner at the transcriptome (microarray) and proteome (proteomics) level.

Some of the choice may come down to factors related to individual study design. For example, to study alternative splicing, oligonucleotide arrays are preferable to cDNA-based arrays (Shoemaker et al. , 2001). Most commercial platforms involve short (22- to 25-mer; Affymetrix) or longer (30- to 70-mer; Codelink/Amersham; Agilent; BD Biosciences) oligonucleotides representing unique sequences from individual genes. Affymetrix arrays are manufactured using a unique in situ synthesis of short oligon ucleotides using a patented photolithography method (Lipshutz et al. , 1999). Agilent arrays are made using ink jet printing technology for in situ synthesis of 60-mer oligonucleotides on the array (Hughes et al. , 2001), whereas Amersham Codelink arrays are com- posed of covalently attached 30-mer oligonucleotides (Ramakrishnan et al. , 2002). All of the major platforms use some form of fluorescent labeling of the applied probe to detect gene expression (Karsten and Geschwind, 2002). In general, oligonucleotides are easier to scale to mass production and afford easier quality control than cDNA. cDNA arrays involve more steps, including large-scale PCR amplification of clone inserts, insert purification, resuspension in printing buffer, and gridding onto a non- porous surface, most commonly a 30 × 15 mm glass microscope slide (Luo and Geschwind, 2001; Karsten and Geschwind, 2002). A typical cDNA array is printed using a computer-controlled robotic cantilever arm; each spot is about 50 to 150 μ M in diameter. To print an oligonucleotide array, one can use the same gridding robot, arraying purchased sets of oligonucleotides, omit- ting the time consuming step of clone insert amplifica- tion and purification. Other flexible and porous surfaces such as a nylon membrane can also be used as array sur- faces, and these can be probed with radioactive targets (Whitney et al. , 1999; Chiang et al. , 2001). The major advantage to in-house manufactured cDNA or oligonucleotide arrays is their reduced cost. However, this advantage has to be balanced with the improved reliability and batch-to-batch consistency obtained with many more expensive, commercial arrays. Printing consistent, high quality cDNA arrays is diffi- cult and has been accomplished by only a few centers. To address this problem, NINDS and NIMH have funded a microarray consortium consisting of three centers to provide consistent low-cost arrays and expertise to the neuroscience community (http://arrayconsortium.cnmc research.org/NINDS/jsp/overview.jsp). The reliability of these arrays remains to be demonstrated, but they should serve as a reasonable alternative to commercial arrays. Few studies of array reliability have been published (Ramakrishnan et al. , 2002; Yuen et al. , 2002; Barczak et al. , 2003), and whether the commercial sets of partial or whole genome oligonucleotide sets (e.g., Sigma, Illumina, Operon, MWG) for in-house printing perform as well as cDNA arrays or commercial oligonucleotide arrays from Agilent, Codelink, or Affymetrix is not firmly established; however, initial publications assessing printed oligonucleotide arrays are promising (Barczak et al. , 2003). Furthermore, in most published studies, when gene expression changes that are identified as sig- nificantly differentially expressed with either a single cDNA or oligonucleotide platform are checked using alternative methods such as RT-PCR, Northern blotting, or in-situ hybridization, the majority of such changes are usually confirmed (Mirnics et al. , 2000; Geschwind et al. , 2001; Ramakrishnan et al. , 2002; Iwashita et al. , 2003; Karsten et al. , 2003). This attests to the reliability of the standard microarray platforms in general. Whatever platform is used, microarray technology offers the ability to rapidly survey all of the genes expressed in the genome (tr anscriptome) in parallel for a very low per- gene cost. Several hundred articles have been published using microarrays to study a variety of problems in basic and clinical neuroscience (Geschwind, 2003). Some of the more notable early studies include a survey of gene expression across mouse strains and brain regions (Sandberg et al. , 2000; Mody et al. , 2001; Pavlidis and Noble, 2001; Brown et al. , 2002a, 2002b; Su et al. , 2002), neural stem cell biology (Geschwind et al. , 2001; Terskikh et al. , 2001; Karsten et al. , 2003), human post- mortem schizophrenic brain (Mirnics et al. , 2000), multi- ple sclerosis (Whitney et al. , 1999, 2001; Lock et al. , 2002), as well as the downstream effects of single gene defects in mouse models of neurodevelopmental disor- ders such as Fragile X and Rett syndrome (Brown et al. , 2001; D’Agata et al. , 2002; Tudor et al. , 2002). We believe that the application of microarrays and proteomics tech- niques to study both human tissues and disease models will lead to the discovery of numerous novel pathways for drug development in neurological disease. From this per- spective, this technology truly fulfills the promise of translating the genome from the bench to the bedside (Geschwind, 2003). A major issue in microarray experimentation is the need for statistical and computational know how, which is often underestimated by the first-time user. The actual array hybridization experiment takes very little time; most of the time is consumed in analyzing the large volume of data produced. Data management and bioinformatic analysis is a key component of microarray experiments (Kohane et al. , 2002). Numerous tools are available to annotate gene expression lists and to connect these genes with biological pathways (Geschwind, 2002). A detailed discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this chap- ter, but a number of helpful reviews, books, and websites are available in this area (Karsten and Geschwind, 2002; Genomics, Proteomics, and Neurology 219 Ch13.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 219"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Kohane et al. , 2002; Nadon and Shoemaker, 2002). The growth of microarray data repositories will allow for innovative methods of data analysis using existing data sets, and it is clear that data sharing greatly increases the utility of the genomic approach using microarrays (Geschwind, 2001b). A Roadmap: Basic Issues of Experimental Design and Limitations Whether or not one uses microarrays or other meth- ods that measure gene expression in a particular experi- ment depends on many factors (Geschwind, 2001a; Luo and Geschwind, 2001; Karsten and Geschwind, 2002). If one is interested in studying only a handful of genes in a large number of samples, quantitative RT-PCR may be optimal. In-depth analysis of a single tissue may be best served by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and massively parallel signature sequencing, which both involve large-scale sequencing of small sequence tags that allow relatively unambiguous and efficient identifi- cation of genes (Brenner et al. , 2000; Velculescu et al. , 2000). The frequency of each fragment is determined by counting, so as to assess the relative abundance of that particular gene in a particular library. For example, genes expressed in different cancer cells have been identified using SAGE libraries derived from those cell lines. The sensitivity of these techniques is directly related to the amount of sequencing done and, in many cases with deep sequencing efforts, will be more sensitive than microarrays (Velculescu et al. , 1995, 2000; Brenner et al. , 2000; Datson et al. 2001; Evans et al. , 2002). However, these techniques are expensive and time consuming and are best suited for an in-depth analysis of all genes expressed in only a few (one to three) libraries from tis- sues or cells. So, if one wants to identify every gene expressed in a given tissue, these clone and count meth- ods are ideal. Databases of SAGE-derived gene abun- dances derived from the efforts of many investigators, each studying a few cell types or tissues, are available and will be increasingly useful as their number expands (Velculescu et al. , 2000). Microarrays may not be quite as sensitive, but are more rapid, and allow nearly two orders of magnitude more comparisons for the same price as these sequencing-based methods. Thus, microarrays are optimal for a high throughput design, when more than a few samples are compared, and biological replicates will be studied (Karsten and Geschwind, 2002). Which Array? The most important issue in this regard (after asking, Is it affordable?) is whether some of the genes of poten- tial interest are on the array. If one has a few candidate genes, it is helpful to ensure that these genes are present. Until now, one has needed two arrays from major vendors to cover the entire genome. Single slide whole genome arrays from most major vendors cover about 80% to 90% of the transcriptome. In addition, no assessment of alter- native splicing can be made using these commercial arrays. We have approached the issue of gene coverage in two ways. The first way is to use subtraction to create arrays of subtracted libraries that are designed to study specific biological processes of interest (Dougherty and Geschwind, 2002). For example, we have used represen- tational difference analysis subtraction to create microar- rays to study neural and other stem cell populations (Geschwind et al. , 2001; Terskikh et al. , 2001), as well as cerebral patterning during embryogenesis in mice and humans (Geschwind and Miller, 2001). The value of this combined approach is evidenced by the success of these studies in identifying a number of novel genes likely to be critical regulators of neural stem cell self-renewal and pluripotentiality, as well as novel patterning genes. The second method to enhance for genes of interest on microarrays is to use bioinformatics to identify the majority of the genes expressed in the brain, or system of interest, and make an array using these genes. Preliminary neuroarra ys of this type have been made by BD Biosciences/Clontech and Kevin Becker at NIA and his colleagues (Barrett et al. , 2001). We have used a combination of bioinformatics and discrete expert knowledge to create a larger neuroarray containing about 11,000 genes expressed in the nervous system (www.brainmapping.com). We anticipate making a large scale oligonucleotide-based neuroarray and testing it during 2004, making it available through the NIH con- sortium in late 2004. Replication and Statistical Analysis Early microarray studies used few samples and few biologic replicates because of the cost of arrays. It is now clear that even with the most reliable array plat- forms, the use of biological replicates is important (Karsten and Geschwind, 2002). This necessitates care- ful attention to experimental design and choice of an array platform that will afford the ability to perform the number of experiments required to identify reliable changes in gene expression (Yang and Speed, 2002). A minimum of three replicates is usually required, although this depends on the purpose of the study and amount of downstream confirmation to be done. For example, in an elegant study, Zirlinger and colleagues were able to get by using few arrays in their study of amygdala genes, because the arrays were only being used as an initial screening device to identify genes for large scale in situ hybridization experiments (Zirlinger et al. , 220 Genomics, Proteomics, and Neurology Ch13.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 220"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"2001). In this study, there was no attempt to identify sta- tistically significant cha nges—a goal that requires careful replication. Although initial studies relied little on statis- tics, identifying genes meeting a certain threshold (Schena et al. , 1995; Geschwind et al. , 2001), or belonging to a particular cluster (Iyer et al. , 1999; Zhang and Zhao, 2000), statistically defined cutoffs are now more or less required to define differentially expressed genes (Nadon and Shoemaker, 2002; Sabatti et al. , 2002; Irizarry et al. , 2003; Smyth et al. , 2003). In most cases, the major statis- tical problem is not whether the genes identified are false positives, but how many genes have been missed ( α error) because of the large number of multiple comparisons being done relative to the number of independent repli- cates. Many new methods that help surmount this prob- lem have been described (Long et al. , 2001; Nadon and Shoemaker, 2002; Sabatti et al. , 2002), and are now in widespread use. Even with careful replication, some degree of confir- mation using an alternative method is usually required. In most cases, this method is RT-PCR, Northern blot- ting, or in situ hybridization of a few of the key changes identified. In our initial study of the genetic program of neural stem cells and progenitors, we performed a large number of Northern blots and in situ hybridizations because of the few replicates performed. This technique demonstrated that in spite of the lack of statistics, the threshold methods used were robust, and the majority of genes identified as differentially expressed by arrays were confirmed (Geschwind et al. , 2001). Limitations and Technical and Methodological Issues RNA Quality The most important consideration is RNA quality. Only the highest quality RNA should be used. In most cases, using total RNA is preferable to mRNA, given the fewer processing steps and excellent results obtained with total RNA (Karsten et al. , 2002). Small variability in conditions can also induce large changes in gene expression (Karsten and Geschwind, 2002). In tissue culture experiments, factors such as media batch, or CO 2 or temperature variation in the incubator can con- found results. Other common sources of variability include any cDNA amplification methods used, probe labeling, hybridization conditions, and washing (Karsten and Geschwind, 2002). The same methods should always be used to compare two conditions. When these issues of experimental design are considered and proper technique is applied, micr oarray experiments provide reliable and consistent data on gene expression at a systems level. Human Disease When considering the use of human tissue, these vari- ables include tissue preservation methods, postmortem interval, dissection methods, and RNA quality (Ginsberg and Che, 2002; Karsten et al. , 2002; VanDeerlin et al. , 2002). Frozen tissue generally provides the best material, although ethanol fixation can be used. Differences in gene expression between samples may be due to differ- ences in genetic background (ethnicity) and sex, and also must be considered, necessitating a larger number of samples than with inbred mouse strains or cell culture (Geschwind, 2000). One critical issue that is often not considered when studying human disease is the stage of disease in the indi- vidual from whom the tissue has been obtained. In most cases, these are postmortem, or chronic cases, where the pathological changes are in their end stages. For example, in neurodegenerative disease, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, or Alzheimer’s disease, most of the critically affected neurons or glia are already lost. In this case, a microarray study is only able to elucidate the changes in gene expression accompanying neuronal loss, rather than the initial metabolic insults. So at a biological level, what one observes are changes in gene expression that signify loss of particular cells. Unfortunately, this does little to enhance our under- standing of the mechanism of disease. In the same vein, study of neurodevelopmental diseases such as autism, during embryonic or fetal development, is precluded, so we are left with assessing the outcome rather than the cause. However, in a disease like autism, or schizo- phrenia, where relatively little is known about the regions or cell types affected, this kind of information is far more valuable than in a disease such as Parkinson’s dis- ease, where the pathological alterations are relatively well documented. Cellular Heterogeneity A major concern of many neuroscientists is the detec- tion limit of microrrays. This is an issue in neuroscience where most tissues being studied are relatively heteroge- neous, in contrast to cell lines or cancer cells, which are simpler systems. Most array platforms allow reliable detection of species at 1/100,000 the level of low abun- dance mRNAs within a given cell. However, central nervous system tissues can be composed of dozens or hundreds of cell types, so that some low abundance genes will not be detected in heterogeneous tissues. This makes it a reasonable consideration of experimental design to focus on small brain regions or individual cells. Methods such as single cell PCR and microdissection (Eberwine et al. , 1992; Crino et al. , 1996; Ginsberg et al. , Genomics, Proteomics, and Neurology 221 Ch13.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 221"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"2000) and laser capture microdissection (LCM) (Luo et al. , 1999; Kamme et al. , 2003) allow for capture of cDNA from single cells, permitting the study of gene expression in a single cell type or group of cells (Tietjen et al. , 2003). These methods facilitate the study of epileptic foci, tuberous sclerosis lesions (Crino et al. , 1996), neurofibrillary tangles, and a number of other focal or cell type-specific lesions observed in disease (Ginsberg et al. , 2000; VanDeerlin et al. , 2002). For practical reasons, however, it is often preferable to start the gene expression profiling study using a particular brain region or tissue, which can be monitored using methods that provide more microscopic cellular resolu- tion. Again, this goal will depend on the precise line of study. To understand the vulnerability of particular cell classes to disease-causing mutations, such as dopamin- ergic neurons in Parkinson’s disease, specific motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hippocampal neurons in Alzheimer’s disease, study at the level of the cell is likely to be required. Preliminary Success in Studies of Disease: Biomarkers and Disease Pathophysiology We view the use of cDNA microarray technology to study disease as falling into two major classes: (1) those that attempt to identify causal molecular alterations occurring in disease, and (2) those trying to identify bio- markers that will aid in diagnosis and patient classifica- tion. The main goal of the first group of studies is to advance knowledge as to disease pathophysiology. The main goal(s) of the second group of studies is to improve the accuracy of diagnosis or to identify subsets of patients most likely to respond to specific therapies. Several studies have taken the first approach, attacking diseases such as schizophrenia (Mirnics et al. , 2000; Hakak et al. , 2001; Hemby et al. , 2002; Middleton et al. , 2002; Vawter et al. , 2002), multiple sclerosis (Whitney et al. , 1999, 2001; Lock et al. , 2002; Mycko et al. , 2003), alcoholism (Lewohl et al. , 2000; Mayfield et al. , 2002), and brain tumors (Rickman et al. , 2001; Pollack et al. , 2002; Pomeroy et al. , 2002). Complex genetic diseases, or those that are sporadic such as Multi-System Atrophy, are excellent choices for microarray analysis because other genetic approaches, although direct, require enormous coordinated effort from many investigators and will not help with sporadic diseases (Risch and Merikangas, 1996; Nadeau and Frankel, 2000). The use of arrays offers an alternative to positional cloning by simultaneously assay- ing both the effects of genes and the environment that lead to alterations in gene expression that eventually cause dis- ease. In most common diseases, which are genetically complex, these methods offer a manner for identifying new pathways involved in disease pathophysiology, with the hope that these pathways will be good therapeutic targets. Microarrays have also been successfully used in mouse models of developmental defects or disease, including Freidreich’s ataxia (Tan et al. , 2003), fragile X (Brown et al. , 2001), and Rett syndrome (Colantuoni et al. , 2001; Tudor et al. , 2002). Using microarrays to identify the critical pathways altered early in disease in transgenic or knockout models where a single gene or combination of genes has been altered is an especially compelling approach (Livesey et al. , 2000). In this case, the issues of postmortem artifacts, stage of disease, and genetic back- ground, which can plague human postmortem studies, can be avoided (Geschwind, 2000). Tissues can be stud- ied early, berfore neuronal loss or the downstream effects of disease. Pathways altered in animal models can be identified and then tested to see whether they are simi- larly altered in humans, providing confirmation of their relevance to the human disease. Biomarkers of Disease Most published studies using microarrays have been directed at identifying mechanisms causing disease. We are aware of only one major study that has looked for biomarkers that could aid in diagnosis (Tang et al. , 2001). The lack of published articles in this area is prob- ably due to the intense criticism that these studies will not work, because they do not look at brain tissue, but peripheral tissues such as blood. We believe that this is a specious and overly conservative criticism that underesti- mates the power of both gene expression profiling and proteomics techniques. Evidence supporting this position is provided by the important study of Tang et al. (2001). Tang and colleagues compared gene expression profiles in blood using Affymetrix arrays in rats subjected to acute models of stroke, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, and seizures. Specific patterns of gene expression were identi- fied that allowed distinguishing between these neurologic insults, 24 hours after the insult occurred. These data provide a proof of principle that complex patterns of peripheral blood gene expression can accurately predict the cause of a previous acute brain injury. The obvious next step is to see whether these patterns are useful in diagnosis of human patients in clinical settings. While this approach is risky in that it may fail, it poses little risk to patients, and its benefits are clear. We anticipate a time in the future when gene expression profiling in peripheral blood will be used as an additional piece of data to diag- nose patients in an acute setting (Geschwind, 2003). Perhaps more valuable will be the use of these techniques in the diagnosis of chronic or subacute ill- nesses. Already, microarrays have been used to accurately classify brain tumors, adding precision beyond classic 222 Genomics, Proteomics, and Neurology Ch13.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 222"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"pathological grading (Rickman et al. , 2001; Pomeroy et al. , 2002; Mischel et al. , 2003; Shai et al. , 2003). It is unknown whether gene expression in peripheral blood allows differentiation between patients with different neu- rodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Lewy body disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or frontotempo- ral dementia. Such approaches could allow for early diag- nosis and hence presymptomatic treatment (Figure 13.2; see also the Color Plate section). This is a huge issue, as once symptoms appear, it may be too late to regain previ- ous functional status. In addition, gene expression profiles could predict drug response or toxicity, helping the clini- cian to optimize or individualize therapy (Figure 13.2). This is especially important in cancer therapy, where chemotherapeutic response is often hard to predict, and toxicities are serious. In addition, could a subset of the gene expression alterations observed in the studies of brain tumors themselves be identified in peripheral blood or other peripheral cell lines derived from patients, so as to allow screening? The issue of using peripheral blood cells or other peripheral cells for screening or disease biomarkers is an important clinical issue that begs for pilot studies looking at gene expression in patients with chronic neurological disease. And while microarrays are optimal for studying mRNA expressed in cells, certain obtainable biological specimens such as cerebrospinal fluid or serum, may be hard to study using microarrays, as they are protein rich and mRNA poor. These tissues are perhaps better studied using proteomics techniques, which offer a similar promise of identifying biomarkers for chronic neurological diseases. PROTEOMICS Why Proteins? With an estimated 30,000 genes in the human genome, which could translate into an order of magnitude greater number of proteins when alternative splicing and post- translational modifications are considered, a natural, if not necessary, complement to gene expression patterns is an understanding of the protein products of these genes. Although studying gene expression at the mRNA level has the advantage of being more scalable and is cur- rently easier than working with protein, mRNA does not Genomics, Proteomics, and Neurology 223 Patients with Alzheimer’s disease A molecular fingerprint with potential predictive value Treatment Non-responders Responders WBC (green) WBC (red) Patients with frontotemporal dementia Patients with Alzheimer’s disease A molecular fingerprint with potential diagnostic value WBC (green) WBC (red) B A FIGURE 13.2 The use of microarrays for disease classification. A: Microarrays can be used to detect single nucleotide differences (polymorphisms) or identify gene expression patterns that predict treatment outcome or adverse effects in patients. B: Oligonucleotide arrays that allow polymorphism detection in a number of candidate genes simultaneously, such as cytochrome p450, that may affect drug metabolism, hence predisposing to treatment failure or adverse effects, will likely soon be widely adopted. Microarrays may also be used to augment diagnostic protocols. In the speculative example shown, mRNA from peripheral blood leukocytes is hybridized onto a cDNA array and the pattern indicates whether the patient is more likely to have Alzheimer’s disease or frontotemporal dementia. Perhaps, more readily adopted into clinical practice will be the use of arrays to classify tumor samples from patients to both aid in diagnosis and predict optimal treatment.

There are estimated to be more than 300 different posttranslational modifica- tions including glycosylation, nitration, oxidation, and phosphorylation, highlighting the diversity of protein products possible from a single gene (Aebersold and Goodlett, 2001). Altered protein expression or modifica- tion is likely to provide valuable clues to understanding the disease state, aiding diagnosis, and targeting drug therapy. Clinically relevant biological samples such as serum, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and urine are protein rich (Bergquist et al. , 2002) and RNA poor, rendering them inferior candidates for DNA array studies but excellent for proteomics-based studies. By combining proteomic and genomic techniques, investigators can overcome the drawbacks of genomic approaches described previously, and ultimately provide a founda- tion for correlating protein function or protein modifica- tion with disease states. What Is Proteomics? Proteomics is broadly defined as the identification and analysis of sets of proteins expressed within anything from a cell through to an organism, and encompasses the determination of protein-protein interactions, protein localization (such as within an organelle or aggregate), identification of posttranslational modifications, tempo- ral expression patterns, and function. Characterization of the proteome is an attempt to describe all proteins within a cell or organism in a defined state and several proteomes relevant to neuroscience are being analyzed, including the mouse and rat cerebellum (Taoka et al. , 2000; Beranova- Giorgianni et al. , 2002) and human cortex (Langen et al. , 1999). In the context of neurological disease, however, the focus is rather on differential protein profiling to identify changes in protein expression or modification between normal and abnormal states, to understand the basic biology, or to develop diagnostic tools and treatments (Petricoin et al. , 2002; Hanash, 2003; Petricoin and Liotta, 2003). Proteomics strategies have been success- fully used in the area of Alzheimer’s disease to identify oxidized proteins in postmortem diseased brain (Castegna et al. , 2003), in Down syndrome (Yoo et al. , 2001; Weitzdoerfer et al. , 2002), and brain tumors (Zhang et al. , 2003) to identify disease-related proteins, and in Huntington’s disease (HD) to identify both proteins asso- ciated with intracellular aggregates (Suhr et al, 2001) and differentially expressed proteins in an HD mouse model and postmortem human HD tissue (Zabel et al. , 2002). Traditional approaches to studying proteins include Western blot, immunocytochemistry, immunoprecipitation, and yeast two-hybrid analyses. These techniques generally require probing single proteins at a time, demand a prior knowledge of the protein (such as the molecular weight or amino acid sequence), or are dependent on the use of exist- ing antibodies. Similar to their RNA counterparts of Northern blotting, RNAse protection, or in situ hybridiza- tion, these traditional protein approaches also preclude dis- covery of novel but potentially clinically relevant proteins. Comparable to microarrays, protein profiling is used as a discovery tool because of the ability to analyze many proteins at one time without previous knowledge or bias. Profiling of complex mixtures of proteins progressed sig- nificantly in the 1970s with the application of two- dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE) (O’Farrell, 1975), whereby proteins are separated according to charge by iso- electric focusing in the first dimension, and according to size using standard sodium dodecye sulfate-polyacry- lamide gel electrophesis (SDS-PA GE) in the second dimen- sion. Identification of proteins was limited, however, and was based on isoelectric point and molecular weight esti- mations (Skene and Willard, 1981; Bellatin et al. , 1982; Schubert et al. , 1986; Castellucci et al. , 1988; Kennedy et al. , 1988; Geschwind and Hockfield, 1989). Sequencing of the protein through Edman degradation provided addi- tional information but was an option only for higher abun- dance proteins, as it requires substantial amounts of pure protein. This was a considerable limitation to the down- stream analysis of differentially expressed proteins (Geschwind et al. , 1996). A Roadmap for Mass Spectrometry–Based Proteomics: Basic Issues of Experimental Design and Limitations We can now separate proteins using gel- and non-gel- based systems and identify them by MS, greatly improv- ing the power and efficiency of proteomics research (Aebersold and Goodlett, 2001; Mann et al. , 2001). Contemporary proteomics is composed of three compo- nents (Figure 13.3): (1) analytical separation to reduce the complexity of the protein matrix; (2) MS analysis to measure the mass of either the peptides from the digested protein or the intact protein; and (3) bioinformatic analy- sis for protein and/or PTM identification and ultimately for generation of protein networks and signaling path- ways. There is a multitude of technical options within each component, discussed in detail later, enabling the researcher to custom design experiments best suited for the biological sample and the scientific question. Automation is possible at essentially every point in the process and generally allows for medium to high throughput analysis, although the technology can be expensive, is not currently widely available, and, in some cases, is still being developed. Although the basic 224 Genomics, Proteomics, and Neurology Ch13.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 224"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"proteomics experiment is illustrated in Figure 13.4, it is important to note that no one experimental design will provide complete coverage of the proteome, necessitat- ing a combination of techniques both at the level of sep- aration and of MS analysis. Proteomics Platforms: Separating Proteins Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis The most common approach to the separation of complex protein mixtures is 2DGE, and within the last decade, there has been marked improvement in resolu- tion, reliability, and MS compatibility (Gorg et al. , 2000; Ong and Pandey, 2001). Gel-based protein sepa- rations are best suited for protein identification by pep- tide mass and sequencing experiments, as intact proteins are difficult to extract from gels (Nesatyy and Ross, 2002). Proteins are separated by 2DGE, detected with a protein stain such as Coomassie Blue or the more sensitive fluorescent stains (for example, SyproRuby) and imaged. The most sensitive dyes are capable of detecting nanograms of protein per spot, so analysis of lower abundance proteins (1/10,000 to 1/100,000) require the application of hundreds of micrograms of sample protein. Although it is possible to resolve several thousands of proteins by 2DGE, the technique is time-consuming and difficult to automate, and gel-to-gel comparisons can be challenging. Gel comparisons are more rapid and reliable with difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) reagents that label each protein sample with a unique cyanine dye, allowing multiple samples to be analyzed within the same gel (Unlu et al. , 1997). Zhou et al. (2002) used DIGE reagents to compare total cell lysates of esophageal carcinoma cells and normal cells prepared from the same frozen tissue sample and were able to identify 165 cancer-specific proteins with a greater than threefold difference. After image analysis, differentially expressed proteins are excised as individ- ual gel pieces and digested in the gel with a protease such as trypsin. The peptides are extracted from the gel and the protein is identified by MS, the most common instruments used being matrix-assisted laser desorp- tion ionization–time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and electrospray ionization-ion trap mass spectrometers, discussed in detail later. To identify oxidized proteins, Castegna et al . (2003) analyzed total cell lysates of both control and Alzheimer’s disease postmortem human brains using 2DGE, matrix-assisted laser des- orption ionization–time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF), and liquid chromatography-MS/MS to identify six differen- tially nitrated proteins, the roles of which remain to be determined (Castegna et al. , 2003). Drawbacks to gel-based separations include less than maximal extractions of tryptic peptides from in-gel digestion and incomplete peptide map coverage of the protein, restricting protein identification (Gygi et al. , 2000). A major limitation to gel-based separations is an existing bias against lower abundance proteins and pro- teins in certain classes (hydrophobic, highly acidic, or basic). Membrane proteins, which are important for cell- to-cell communication, cellular transport, and drug tar- geting, pose a unique challenge, as they are likely present at a low copy number within the cell, in addition to being hydrophobic. Chromatography To analyze those classes of proteins not amenable to 2DGE, to increase throughput, and to improve repro- ducibility, chromatography involving a series of separa- tion chemistries (such as ion exchange, reverse phase, size exclusion) is used (Link et al. 1999; Whitelegge et al. , 2002; Wu et al. , 2003).

Listed below each component are the basic experimental options available. Separation of proteins is accomplished by either gel or chromatography based methods. Mass spectrometry (MS) is used to measure the masses of whole proteins and peptides, to provide peptide sequence, and to generate m/z profiles. Bioinformatics is concerned with interpreting MS data and to ultimately understanding the information in the context of the biological system.

As with gel-based separations, however, certain proteins may not be repre- sented in the analysis, although this is becoming less of an issue as these techniques are further refined. To exploit the improved coverage of membrane proteins with chromatographic separations, Schirmer et al . (2003) used multidimensional chromatography and ion trap MS of peptide digests to identify 67 previously unknown potential integral membrane proteins of the nuclear envelope, 23 of which mapped to chromosomal regions linked to various dystrophies. In another study to investigate the effects of treatment with a novel anti- cancer drug, peninsularinone, Yan et al . (2003) studied total cell lysates from a treated and control human ade- nocarcinoma cell line. Cytosolic proteins were separated by ion exchange chromatography (isoelectric point) in the first dimension and by nonporous reverse phase chromatography (hydrophobicity) in the second dimen- sion. Intact proteins were mass measured using electro- spray-time-of-flight MS, and digested proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF MS, and by MALDI-QTOF if there was ambiguity in protein identification. Differential protein expression was evaluated by chro- matographic subtraction software. This strategy, while also yielding an overwhelming amount of information on each protein (isoelectric point, hydrophobicity, intact mass for possible PTMs, protein identification, and rel- ative abundance), offers an improvement on repro- ducibility over 2DGE. The features, strengths, and weaknesses of both gel and chromatography-based approaches to protein separation are summarized in Table 13.1. Enhancing Quantitation with Isotope-Coded Affinity Tag Technology To improve both the qualitative and quantitative analysis of protein expression, isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) technology is currently the best strategy and is used with both gel and chromatography separation techniques (Gygi et al. , 1999a). ICAT labels two protein samples separately with “heavy” and “light” isotope reagents and the samples are mixed. MS analysis of the modified peptide mix reveals a parallel heavy and light profile, the intensities of which vary according to pro- tein (or peptide) abundance. In a study to identify and quantify the effects of an antitumor drug, camp- tothecin, on primary cultured cortical neurons, Yu and colleagues (2002) used ICAT reagents to label soluble proteins from treated and untreated cells. Using liquid chromatography-MS/MS f or sequence information (and subsequent protein identification) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron (FTICR) MS for precise measurements of peptide mass and abundance, they identified 129 differ- entially expressed proteins. Although this particular drug may not be effective in humans, this work demonstrates the higher throughput, accuracy, and power gained by combining techniques to examine the effects of drug treatment at the level of the proteome. The main disadvantage of ICAT is that the reagents only label cysteine-containing peptides, so if a particu- lar protein or peptide does not happen to contain a cysteine residue (more likely for a peptide), it will not be represented. Development of additional reagents for labeling other functional groups is proceeding rapidly. 226 Genomics, Proteomics, and Neurology FIGURE 13.4 Flow diagram of a basic proteomics experiment. 1: Diseased and normal tissue or fluid samples are prepared and simpli- fied to concentrate or isolate the proteins of interest. 2: The proteins in the samples are separated by gel electrophoresis.

J. Thomson, MS was not effective for protein analysis until the development of soft ionization tech- niques in the 1980s. MS has now emerged as the method of choice for identifying and sequencing proteins. The fundamental advantage to coupling MS to protein analysis is the ability to obtain accurate mass measure- ments of biological molecules. This characteristic enables researchers to identify proteins from their pep- tide masses and sequence information to analyze intact protein mass (Gomez et al. , 2002), as well as to deter- mine the nature and location of posttranslational modi- fications (Whitelegge et al. , 1999, 2000; McLachlin and Chait, 2001; Mann and Jensen, 2003). In addition, MS generally requires low picomoles (10 − 12 moles) of mate- rial and does not require 100% protein purity. Acquisition of MS data is highly automated, and the structural as well as the functional assessment of these data is facilitated by available software and databases, such as Sonar and Sequest, and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Identification of Proteins Protein identification based on intact mass alone is difficult, as several proteins may possess a similar mass, and theoretical mass calculated from gene sequence rarely matches the measured mass of the expressed pro- tein. Identification of proteins is best approached by digesting the protein before MS analysis, using a site- specific cleavage reagent such as the protease, trypsin, and measuring the mass of the resulting peptides. The protein is identified by comparing the e xperimental “mass fingerprint,” containing no fewer than four to five pep- tide masses, to theoretical “mass fingerprints” predicted from in silico digests of proteins within a database. The most confident approach to protein identification, how- ever, is to obtain partial amino acid sequence of these peptides by fragmenting the peptide within the mass spectrometer (termed collision-induced dissociation) and mass measuring the products (a tandem MS or MS/MS experiment). The peptides break predictably at the pep- tide bond from both the N and C termini, resulting in the creation of a ladder of N-terminus (or b type) and C- terminus (or y type) product ion (m/z) peaks. Mass analysis of the resulting fragments provides sequence information, as the difference between each m/z peak is a reflection of the mass of the cleaved amino acid, each amino acid (with the exception of the isomers, leucine and isoleucine) having a unique mass. Proteins are confi- dently identified with as few as one or two peptides, again, by comparison with in silico digests and sequence of known proteins. Previously uncharacterized proteins for which there is no match in existing databases are Genomics, Proteomics, and Neurology 227 TABLE 13.1 Summary of the Two Broad Experimental Approaches to Separating Complex Mixtures of Proteins before Analysis by Mass Spectrometry Gel-Based Separations Non-gel-based Separations Example 2DGE Multi-dimensional chromatography Form of protein Proteins applied as intact but are extracted from Intact or digested proteins gel as peptides Type of information Protein and PTM identification; intact protein mass Possibility for both intact protein mass difficult to determine and protein identification Throughput Low to medium, difficult to automate High, amenable to automation Qualitative protein Based on gel image comparisons, improved with Based on chromatographic subtraction expression DIGE reagents Quantitative protein Semi-quantitative, improved with DIGE and Yes, improved with ICAT reagents expression ICAT reagents Advantages Well-established technique, ease of use, visual results May offer better representation of low abundance, hydrophobic, highly basic and acidic proteins Disadvantages Low abundance, hydrophobic, highly basic and acidic Certain proteins may be underrepresented, proteins may be underrepresented, reproducibility issues incomplete resolution of proteins/peptides Types of samples Tissue and cell lysates, biological fluids Tissue and cell lysates, biological fluids 2DGE , two-dimensional gel electrophoresis; PTM , posttranslational modification; DIGE , difference gel electrophoresis; ICAT , isotope-coded affinity tag.

Identification of PTMs pres- ent within the peptide is made by incorporating the pos- sibility into the MS analysis software. A phosphorylation event, for instance, is represented by an 80 dalton shift in the mass. Obviously, if a PTM is present in a peptide that was not analyzed (as a result of poor recovery from the digested gel, for example), it will not be identified. Determining Intact Protein Mass Intact mass measurements of proteins provide insight into protein heterogeneity resulting from PTMs (includ- ing those not identified in digested proteins), alternative splicing events and even DNA sequencing errors. The mass difference between the experimental and the theo- retical mass is, again, a reflection of the modification. The identification and degree of PTMs, however, still present a challenge to the field of MS-based proteomics because of their diversity and stability, although PTM-specific methods are being developed (Mann and Jensen, 2003). Which Mass Spectrometer? The choice of mass spectrometer is frequently deter- mined by availability, as researchers must normally rely on core proteomics facilities. As mentioned previously, the most confident protein identifications are based on peptide sequence information, but not all mass spec- trometers are capable of providing this, as it requires the ability to mass measure and collide peptides, and mass measure the resulting fragments. Protein identification based on peptide mass alone, however, is a reasonable alternative. Mass spectrometers share three fundamental compo- nents: (1) an ion source that generates gas phase ions; (2) a mass analyzer where ions are separated according to mass (m) and charge (z); and (3) an ion detector that records ion arrival and abundance as a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) peak, from which mass information is obtained. Mass spectrometers differ in the type of ion source, as well as in the design of the mass analyzer, and each has its particular strengths and weaknesses, accu- racy, and resolution. Thorough reviews describing mass spectrometers are available (McLuckey and Wells, 2001; Vestal, 2001; Aebersold and Mann, 2003). The amount of a specific protein required for MS analysis varies widely, depending on the specific molecule and the mass spectrometer, but is of the order of low picomoles (10 − 12 moles) of protein. The two most common ion source/mass analyzer com- binations are MALDI-TOF and electrospray ioniza- tion/ion trap mass spectrometers. Table 13.2 offers a brief comparison of these two instruments. MALDI-TOF MS requires spotting the proteins or peptides with an ioniza- tion-enhancing matrix onto a plate and ionization of the sample with a laser. Although MALDI-TOF is best suited for high throughput mass measurement of intact proteins or peptides, limited peptide sequence can also be obtained with a post-source decay experiment, although the frag- mentation pattern is generally more difficult to interpret. Electrospray ionization/ion trap MS requires intro- duction of the protein or peptide into the mass spec- trometer as a fine liquid spray, often from a liquid chromatography system, and as such, requires more analysis time than MALDI-TOF. Ionization of the sam- ple into multiply charged species occurs as a result of an applied voltage differential. Both mass and peptide sequence are obtained in a typical tandem MS experi- ment using this instrument, often described as liquid chromatography-MS/MS. Other instruments exist, such as quadrapole and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometers, as do hybrid instruments, where multiple mass analyzers are placed in series. FT-ICR MS currently offers the highest accuracy (± 0.02 Da for a 20 kDa protein, for example) and resolution, but is costly and not widely available. SELDI-TOF MS and the Quest for Disease Biomarkers For the rapid generation of protein profiles that can be quickly compared for biomarker identification, sur- face-enhanced laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) MS combines separation of complex mix- ture of proteins and MS analysis all on one chip (Issaq et al. , 2003). As little as 1 μ l of protein mixtures, such as saliva or serum, are applied directly to a plate that has a chemically (such as cation exchange) or biochemically (such as an antibody) modified surface. A subset of pro- teins interacts with these surfaces, allowing nonbinding proteins to be washed away. The plate is placed into the mass spectrometer and the bound proteins are mass measured. In a manner analogous to microarrays, pro- files from disease and normal samples are compared to identify disease-specific species or a disease fingerprint that is diagnostically useful (see Figure 13.2). A serious disadvantage to SELDI-TOF MS is the dif- ficulty in identifying the altered proteins, caused mainly by the lower accuracy and resolution of the mass spec- trometer and inability to obtain MS/MS peptide sequence data. Instruments are being developed to cir- cumvent this issue. A comparison of SELDI-TOF to the two other MS instruments is outlined in Table 13.2. SELDI-TOF MS was used to screen serum for detec- tion of ovarian cancer by analyzing low molecular weight serum protein patterns in both diseased and healthy patients (Petricoin et al. , 2002). The identities of these differentially expressed proteins is unknown, however, 228 Genomics, Proteomics, and Neurology Ch13.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 228"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"leaving many unanswered questions regarding the disease biology, but it does demonstrate the potential power of protein profiling in disease detection. Zhang et al. (2002) used SELDI-TOF MS to analyze cellular secretions from CD8 T lymphocytes of immunologically stable HIV- 1-infected patients and observed a unique cluster of peaks in the protein fingerprints. They were fortunate to be able to identify these peaks as α -Defensin 1, 2, and 3, based on intact mass alone, which was verified through the use of antibodies. More sophisticated strategies to the discovery of biomarkers are being developed and include the advanced chromatographic separation, as α - Defensin 1, 2, and 3, labeling technologies, and MS dis- cussed previously. Bioinformatics Programs designed to interpret MS and MS/MS spectra and provide probable protein matches include Sequest (http://fields.scripps.edu/sequest), Sonar (www.genomicslutions.com), and Mascot (www.matrix- science.com), and use existing databases such as NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and SwissProt (www.ebi.ac.uk). Search strategies typically involve peptide mass finger- print data, peptide sequence data, and/or raw MS/MS data (Yates, 1998; Perkins et al. , 1999). Peptide mass fin- gerprint relies strictly on the match of the mass of the fragments produced with those theoretically generated from an in silico digest of known proteins. This strategy relies heavily on mass accuracy, and protein identifica- tion is often confounded by PTMs, mutations, and sequencing errors, which may alter the experimental pep- tide masses. Modifying search conditions to allow for mass changes reflective of PTMs permits their identifica- tion in the peptide. Protein identification by amino acid sequence information, using the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s (NCBI’s) Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search algorithm, for example, is straightforward, although its success in unambiguously identifying proteins is dependent on the amount of sequence queried. Raw MS/MS data offers searching based on peptide mass, as well as peptide sequence, and yields confident protein matches. An important consideration for any of these strategies is that protein identification is possible only if that protein, or one that is highly homologous, exists in the database. De novo sequencing for entirely uncharacterized and unpre- dicted proteins is generally more advanced and techni- cally challenging because, unlike Edman degradation, the peptide will fragment simultaneously from both the C and N terminus, the directionality of which is initially unknown, complicating the interpretation (Shevchenko et al. , 1996). Non-MS-Based Protein Profiling Although the advantages of MS-based proteomics are clear, it is worth mentioning other important advances in protein profiling independent of MS. Protein array technology that is analogous to microarray is currently being developed and is either analytical or functional in nature (Phizicky et al. , 2003; Zhu and Snyder, 2003). Analytical chips use affinity compounds such as antibodies or antigens, whereas functional chips are composed of pure proteins covalently bound to the array surface. In a manner similar to microarrays, the protein arrays are exposed to a fluorescent-labeled pro- tein sample, noninteracting proteins are removed, and interactions are detected. Anderson et al . (2003) used antibody arrays to compare proteins differentially expressed in primary muscle cell cultures from a patient with spinal muscular atrophy compared with control Genomics, Proteomics, and Neurology 229 TABLE 13.2 Summary of Three Common Mass Spectrometry Instruments Used in the Field of Proteomics Electrospray Ionization-Ion MALDI-TOF MS Trap MS SELDI-TOF MS Sample preparation required Yes, although direct tissue Yes Separation occurs directly on analysis possible mass spectrometry (MS) plate Measurement of intact Both, especially valuable to Both, but better suited for Generation of m/z profiles protein or peptide mass examine heterogeneity of peptides and small proteins protein Peptide sequencing Yes, but more difficult to interpret Yes No Advantages Rapid sample analysis (sec/sample) Can be coupled directly to Rapid sample analysis chromatographic systems (sec/sample); m/z fingerprints (LC) offer visual results; separation and MS on one chip Disadvantages Cannot be coupled directly to Analysis time can be significant Difficult to identify chromatographic systems such if using LC (tens of min per differentially expressed as LC sample) proteins Ch13.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 229"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"specimens and observed nine down regulated proteins involved in transcription, six of which were confirmed by oligonucleotide arrays. Although these arrays offer a relatively quick analysis, they are generally dependent on the use of existing and known proteins and antibodies. Some of the challenges facing the protein chip field include optimizing the attachment chemistry of the protein such that neither function nor binding ability is compromised. Importance of Posttranslational Modifications: Phosphorylation as an Example Phosphorylation is an important regulator of pro- tein function and activity and figures prominently in intracellular signaling cascades. Hyperphosphorylation of proteins is believed to play a role in the pathogene- sis of many diseases, including cancer (Sebolt-Leopold, 2000) and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia (Brion et al. , 2001; Jackson et al. , 2002; Agarwal- Mawal et al. , 2003; Pei et al. , 2003). MS-based approaches include 2DGE and 32 P or phosphospecific protein stains such as Pro-Q Diamond for global phos- phoprotein analysis (McLachlin and Chait, 2001). For low abundance phosphorylation events, phosphory- lated proteins or peptides are enriched by affinity purification, followed by identification by MS (Goshe et al. , 2001; Oda et al. , 2001; Zhou et al. , 2001). Newly developed non-MS-based array technologies, although dependent on preexisting knowledge of kinases and substrates, are interesting and perhaps higher-through- put alternatives for more hypothesis-based testing. Zhu et al . (2000) arrayed 119 yeast protein kinases onto a slide and characterized their activities for 17 substrates by 33 P γ -ATP and phosphoimaging. They discovered a number of unpredicted kinase activities, and the exis- tence of many more tyrosine-phosphorylating kinases than predicted. Downstream Confirmation of Results Similar to microarray studies, independent confirma- tion of results is a crucial step in any proteomics experi- ment, and is often accomplished through conventional techniques, such as Western blot for semiquantitative and qualitative protein expression analysis, and immunocytochemistry for localization of the protein. This is augmented by in situ hybridization for localiza- tion of the mRNA and RT-PCR to correlate protein and transcript expression. These protein techniques repre- sent the bottleneck of most studies, as they are generally time-consuming and rely on antibodies for further analysis. Limitations, Technical and Methodological Issues Human Disease Biological fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid (Yuan et al. , 2002; Ramstrom et al. , 2003), urine (Pang et al. , 2002), serum (Anderson and Anderson, 2002), and saliva (Yao et al. , 2003), although not optimal for microarray studies owing to low mRNA levels, are excellent candi- dates for research and diagnosis in biomedical pro- teomics, as alterations in the physiology of cells are likely reflected in the circulating or excreted proteins. Biopsy and postmortem tissue, frozen or ethanol-fixed, is also a potential sample source (Ahram et al. , 2003; Hynd et al. , 2003), but is affected by variability of protein stability and preparation-related protein modifications, as well as those variables outlined in microarray studies, namely tissue preservation methods and prefixation times. Protein quality is as important in proteomics as mRNA quality is in array studies. Proteins can be easily altered (e.g., degraded or oxidized) through sample handling and analysis, often with a deleterious effect on reproducibility of results. Recently, cells and intact tissue have been ana- lyzed directly by MALDI MS, circumventing reliance on any isolation and purification of the proteins (Schwartz et al. , 2003). Stoeckli et al. (2001) have used this tech- nique to examine, in situ , the spatial distribution of dif- ferentially expressed proteins in a human glioblastoma xenograft, demonstrating the ability to analyze protein differences without extensive extractions and separations, effectively decreasing analysis time but, more importantly, minimizing protein degradation or introduction of artifacts. Protein Abundance and Issues of Heterogeneity A successful proteomics strategy begins with simpli- fication of the protein mixture, a necessary first step when one considers the thousands of proteins present, the abundances of which vary by several orders of mag- nitude (Corthals et al. , 2000). Simplification is accom- plished by subcellular fractionation, immunoaffinity purification, or isolation of protein-protein complexes. Tissue heterogeneity continues to be an issue, as it is with cDNA array studies, and small but significant protein expression patterns can be completely obscured by inappropriate choice of sample. There is also the issue of heterogeneity of subcellular localization or protein topography. A protein present at similar levels within two different cell states may be localized specifically to the membrane surface in one state com- pared to another, suggestive of altered protein func- tion. Microarray experiments cannot yield this level of information, as this technique only surveys mRNA abundance. 230 Genomics, Proteomics, and Neurology Ch13.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 230"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"The Transition to the Clinic Despite its potential, MS-based proteomics has not yet fully made its way into the diagnostic clinic and is likely further from this application than arrays because clinic-based applications of proteomics for disease diag- nosis requires quick, cost-effective, and user friendly methodology whose foundation is analysis of patient biomaterial samples for the generation of disease pat- terns. Most current approaches require specialized knowledge for use and interpretation, and are costly. Although biomedical proteomics has the potential to have a tremendous impact on disease diagnosis and treat- ment, it is an emerging clinical technology whose discov- eries require further validation. Biomedical research has generally embraced MS-based proteomics, but state- of-the-art proteomics facilities are certainly not ubiqui- tous, even in research institutions. Basic research applica- tions often demand greater accuracy and resolution, requiring more sophisticated instruments, and knowledge- able personnel to run and maintain them and to correctly analyze the data. In many respects, SELDI-TOF systems that offer “proteomics on a chip” (such as Ciphergen) are in the best position to enter the clinic by offering a low technology, but high throughput platform for disease bio- marker profile discovery. The need continues, however, for the more advanced techniques of protein separation and MS analysis to identify these disease-related proteins, to understand their function, and ultimately to exploit them for uses beyond diagnosis to protein-based therapy. The field of proteomics has benefited greatly from the growing pains experienced by the field of genomics and shows great promise for revolutionizing the way in which we think about, diagnose, and treat disease. MERGING GENOMICS AND PROTEOMICS APPROACHES: NEURAL STEM CELL BIOLOGY Work in our laboratory, and that of our collaborators, provides one example of the complementary nature of genomics and proteomics approaches. DNA array studies of neural stem and progenitor cells in the Kornblum and Geschwind laboratories (Geschwind et al. , 2001; Karsten et al. , 2003) identified a number of novel genes likely to have a role in the regulation of neural stem cell prolifera- tion and pluripotentiality. Surprisingly, few membrane proteins were identified, despite being likely regulators of extrinsic signals involved in central nervous system stem cell fate specifica tion, proliferation, and differentiation. To address this, 2DGE is now being used to separate a mem- brane fraction obtained by differential centrifugation of neural stem and progenitor cells to identify differentially expressed membrane and memb rane-associated proteins. The differentially expressed proteins are cut from the gel, digested with trypsin and the peptides mass measured and sequenced by liquid chromatography-MS/MS. Using this standard proteomics strategy, more than 50 differentially expressed proteins were identified, a small number of which were also identified by microarray studies (Shoemaker et al. , 2003). Most importantly, several mem- brane proteins were identified, including a novel 7 trans- membrane protein. To expand the coverage of differentially expressed membrane proteins, alternative separation strategies such as multidimensional chro- matography are being explored. Further integration of genomics and proteomics data will provide more insight into the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms underlying neural stem cell biology and lead to markers that will enable more specific studies in the area of neural repair (Kornblum and Geschwind, 2001). CHALLENGES AND CONCLUSIONS A daunting challenge facing the field of genomics and proteomics is the merging of microarray and pro- teomics data into meaningful datasets in order to enable the correlation of changes in mRNA with changes in protein profiles (Ideker et al. , 2001). Microarray data are more amenable to sharing and several public data- bases exist (Geschwind, 2001b; Becker et al. , 2002), but the inconsistency of cross-platform comparisons, or cross-laboratory comparisons even within one platform, pose a barrier (Mirnics et al. , 2001). Data sharing pre- sents certain difficulties, as protein and mRNA expres- sion is dynamic, depending on, for example, time of day of sampling, disease stage, and access of the tissue or cells to nutrients and other growth variables such as temperature. Additional variability is introduced during sample preparation and analysis. Standardization of methodologies and result formats may go a long way to improving the technical issues of data sharing. Establishing a standard ontology for microarray exper- iments was a first critical step in achieving that goal (Brazma et al. , 2001; Geschwind, 2001b). Although pub- lic 2DGE image repositories exist (for example www.expasy.ch), there is a need to establish comprehen- sive proteomics databases that contain not only the experimental data but also the information necessary to effectively evaluate and compare data sets, an important consideration because proteins, and the techniques used to study them, are so dynamic. To meet this need, Taylor et al. (2003) recently proposed a model of stan- dardized proteomics data based on MIAME, again, borrowing from the field of genomics. Organizations such as the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO, www.hupo.org) may also play a role in advancing the Genomics, Proteomics, and Neurology 231 Ch13.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 231"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"field of proteomics by encouraging the sharing of data, technologies and bioformatics tools, as well as coordi- nating proteome initiatives. Once these issues are addressed, one is left with the challenge of interpretation. As mentioned previously, there are likely to be biologically real variations between transcript and protein levels; understanding the physio- logical relevance of these differences is a slow process. For example, human glioblastomas have been studied using both cDNA array and proteomics techniques (Sallinen et al. , 2000; Zhang et al. , 2003). Zhang et al . (2003) used an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant glioblastoma model cell line to identify 52 differentially expressed predicted and novel proteins by 2DGE, MALDI-TOF MS, and liquid chromatography-MS/MS. They confirmed five of these proteins by either Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or RT-PCR, and found four that were also highly expressed in human glioblastoma tis- sue. The levels of three of the four proteins correlated with disease grade, suggesting these candidates might be useful to understand the biology, as well as to serve as disease markers. In contrast, microarray studies of glioblastoma and other brain tumors have led to more of a global pic- ture of the pathophysiological alterations, because they have identified large-scale changes in gene expres- sion, leading to improved classification and prediction in many cases (Pomeroy et al. , 2002; Mischel et al. , 2003). One such study was able to predict the chromo- somal origin of an amplification event because of the up regulation of contiguous genes as a separate event from EGFR amplification. In this study, investigation at the protein level in patient tumor specimens identi- fied the EGFR expression changes, which could then be correlated with a particular gene expression profile in those tumors (Mischel et al. , 2003). This illustrates an optimal use of technology to integrate individual protein expression data with global gene expression data. Based on this and other work, it is likely that microarray profiling will soon be used to complement analysis of protein expression by immunohistochem- istry and other methods in the clinic for diagnosis and prognostication in human brain cancers (Geschwind, 2003). Systems biology will play an important role in devel- oping and refining the tools to build, use, and interpret networks of transcript and protein data (Davidov et al. , 2003). Ultimately, we must rely on both genomics and proteomics approaches to understand the interplay of expression, translation, and posttranslational control within the context of disease biology. This level of under- standing is only one, albeit, critical step in developing novel therapeutics.

Indeed, an explo- sion of information regarding the cellular and molecular events responsible for neuronal cell death and recovery has occurred over the last decade. These discoveries have clarified multiple injury cascades, including free radical generation, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, apoptotic cell death, and inflammation, each of which is a prime target for the development of novel therapeutic interventions (McIntosh et al. , 1989; Dirnagl et al. , 1999). An obvious approach to protecting the brain from irreversible injury as a consequence of cerebral ischemia or trauma is preventive measures. To this end, various stroke risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, obe- sity, smoking, and surgical procedures, are just a few tar- geted factors discussed as preventive measures. In the area of traumatic brain injury (TBI), the use of automo- bile seat belts and airbags, as well as the use of motorcy- cle helmets, can help prevent or limit irreversible damage. However, after the primary insult has occurred, strate- gies, including intensive care procedures, to limit second- ary insults and the use of protective strategies to inhibit secondary injury mechanisms may potentially limit dam- age and improve outcome. The ability of these measures to reduce structural damage and improve functional out- come depends on various factors that are a topic of the present discussion. Stroke is the third most common cause of death in most industrialized countries, with an estimated global mortality of 4.7 million/year (American Heart Association, 2002). Stroke killed 283,000 people in 2000 and accounted for about 1 in every 14 deaths in the United States. Each year, about 700,00 people suffer new or recurrent stroke; this is a major cause of serious long- term disability, with more than 1 million reporting func- tional limitations after suffering from stroke. TBI is a leading cause of death and disability among children and young adults. Each year, an estimated 1.5 million Americans sustain head trauma and, as a consequence, 230,000 are hospitalized and survive. A total of 50,000 die, and 80,000 to 90,000 experience the onset of long- term disability. As a cumulative result of past TBI, an estimated 5.3 million men, women, and children in the United States are living with permanent TBI-related dis- ability (Consensus Conference, 1999a). In the area of spinal cord injury (SCI), approximately 11,000 new cases occur each year in the United States. Current estimates are that approximately 250,000 patients are living with paralysis as a result of SCI. Thus continued inves- tigations in the area of neuroprotection are extremely important with regard to limiting the detrimental conse- quences of each of these central nervous system (CNS) injuries. A large amount of literature is available regarding neuroprotection strategies in various models of cerebral ischemia and trauma. Pharmacological treatments tar- geting specific injury cascades, as well as the use of ther- apeutic hypothermia, have provided compelling evidence for neuroprotection in preclinical studies. Nevertheless, few agents have been successfully moved to the clinic, and currently no pharmacological treatments have been proven to protect against the detrimental consequences of TBI (Doppenberg and Bullock, 1997; Maas, 2001; Narayan et al. , 2002). With regard to stroke, there is one treatment that is somewhat successful in a subpopulation 237 CHAPTER 14 Neuroprotection: Where Are We Going? Gary H. Danton, MD, PhD W. Dalton Dietrich, PhD Ch14.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 237"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"of victims. The thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activa- tor has been proven effective in treating stroke when given within 3 hours of the onset of neurological symp- toms (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke rt-PA Stroke Study Group,1995). Thus, successful thrombolysis after vascular thrombosis and emboliza- tion, if occurring early enough, can result in recanaliza- tion and reperfusion of previously ischemic areas. However, a current concern is the potential incidence of reperfusion injury, including hemorrhagic transforma- tion. This potentially detrimental consequence of throm- bolysis has severely limited the number of patients currently being treated with this therapy. PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL EVENTS Stroke A stroke occurs when blood is prevented from prop- erly perfusing a region of the brain, resulting in cell death and neurological deficits. In all, 88% of strokes are ischemic (decreased blood flow) and 12% are hemor- rhagic (owing to a ruptured vessel). Cerebral blood flow (CBF) may be reduced from the entire organ during car- diac arrest or severe hypotension. Flow reductions to part of the brain occur from acute vascular occlusion resulting from processes such as atherothrombosis of cerebral vessels (61% of all stroke excluding transitory ischemic attack) or emboli (24% of all stroke excluding transitory ischemic attack) from the heart, atherosclero- sis of the carotids or aortic arch, and even fat from fractured bones (Wolf et al. , 1977; American Heart Association, 2002). Under ischemic conditions, neurons die when delivery of oxygen and an energy source (e.g., glucose) do not meet the demands of neuronal metabo- lism. Therefore to preserve ischemic neurons, either blood flow needs to be restored or metabolic demand needs to decrease. Approximately 75% of hemorrhagic strokes are due to intracerebral hemorrhage, with the remaining 25% attributed to subarachnoid hemorrhage (American Heart Association, 2002). There are similarities and dif- ferences between the physiological consequences of each particular etiology. Thus stroke is a heterogeneous group of disorders, and treatments that apply to one type of stroke may not apply to others. Traumatic Brain Injury Stroke and traumatic injuries arise from very differ- ent insults. Nevertheless, similarities exist between the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cell death. TBI results from mechanical impact acceleration- deceleration insults that cause skull fractures, compres- sion of cerebral tissues, and tearing of white and gray matter with subsequent hemorrhage (Graham, 1996). TBI, like stroke, can lead to a spectrum of histopatho- logical changes, including hemorrhagic contusion, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and widespread white matter damage (Adams, 1992; Graham and Gennarelli, 1997). As with cerebral ischemia, histopathological damage after TBI can be both focal and diffuse (Cortez et al. , 1989; Dietrich et al. , 1994). Also, countercoup contusions, most common after deceleration of the head, can occur remote from the point of injury. After TBI, the primary insult initiates a wide range of secondary injury mechanisms that critically participate in the pathogenesis (McIntosh et al. , 1998; Bramlett et al. , 1999). Histopathological data from autopsy specimens after fatal head injury, for example, have shown evidence of ischemic processes contributing to the pathological process (Graham and Adams, 1971). The severity of the secondary injury mechanisms may depend on the injury severity (mild, moderate, severe) or location of the pri- mary insult (Graham et al. , 1995). In conditions of severe TBI, reductions in CBF have been reported to reach ischemic levels. Thus cerebral ischemia is discussed as one secondary injury mechanism that may participate in TBI (Miller, 1985). Patterns of both diffuse and focal neuronal injury can be identified after human and experimental TBI (Christman et al. , 1994; Graham et al. , 1995). A common consequence of severe trauma is the generation of a hem- orrhagic contusion that results from blunt head injury or a gliding insult. Both insults can directly damage blood vessels and neuronal membranes, including those of cell bodies and axonal processes (Peerless and Rewcastle, 1967). Regions exhibiting mild reductions in flow can surround focal areas of reduced CBF after brain trauma (DeWitt et al. , 1986; Dietrich et al. , 1996). This sur- rounding area, in some cases, is similar to the penumbral regions surrounding an ischemic core and may contain scattered damaged neurons with an intact neuropil. This area may be both sensitive to therapeutic interventions and at risk for secondary insults. Damage to the hippocampus is commonly reported in autopsy studies of head-injured patients (Kotapka et al. , 1992), and clinical and experimental studies describe cog- nitive abnormalities associated with hippocampal dys- function. In an acceleration model of brain injury in human primates, CA1 hippocampal and histological damage was reported in the majority of animals (Gennarelli and Graham, 1998). Following parasagittal fluid percussion (F-P) brain injury, CA3 hippocampal neurons are reported to be selectively vulnerable, with bilateral damage to the dentate hilus (Lowenstein et al. , 238 Neuroprotection Ch14.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 238"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"1992). Thalamic damage after TBI is also described in clinical and experimental studies (Ross et al. , 1993; Bramlett et al. , 1997b). In human brain injury, the loss of inhibitory thalamic reticular neurons is proposed to underlie some forms of attention deficits. In experimen- tal models, focal damage to the thalamic nuclei is seen with subacute and long-term F-P injury that may result from progressive circuit degeneration after axonal dam- age, neuronal cell death, or from the lack of neurotrophic delivery. Delayed neuronal damage has been reported in the hippocampal CA1 sector after transient cerebral ischemia (Ito et al. , 1975; Pulsinelli et al. , 1982; Kirino et al. , 1984). Only recently has the progressive nature of the histopathological consequences of TBI been appreci- ated. Bramlett and colleagues (1997a) first reported that, two months after a moderate parasagittal F-P injury, sig- nificant atrophy of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus was apparent in histopathological sections. The progressive nature of tissue loss was subsequently documented by Smith and colleagues (1997a), where damage to cortex and hippocampus at various time peri- ods up to 1 year after lateral F-P injury was reported. Dixon and colleagues (1999) reported similar findings in a model of controlled cortical impact injury. Most recently, Bramlett and Dietrich (2002) reported signifi- cant white matter loss at 1 y ear after TBI. Tak en together, these studies emphasize the progressive nature of this pathology and emphasize the complexity of injury processes occurring long term after the primary insult has occurred. DOMINANT MECHANISMS Excitotoxicity After ischemia and traumatic injury, neuronal depo- larization permits sodium and calcium influx. Much of the initial depolarization is due to failure of membrane- bound ion pumps (Taylor and Meldrum, 1995; Dirnagl et al. , 1999; Endres and Dirnagl, 2002). Cell depolariza- tion leads to glutamate release into the synaptic cleft through calcium-mediated exocytosis. Excessive extracel- lular glutamate binds to receptors on adjacent cells. Activated glutamate receptors are both metabotropic and inotropic, acting through G-protein coupled second- ary messenger systems or ligand-gated ion channels, respectively. Subsequent neuronal activation leads to excess calcium entry, possibly the most important event in the excitotoxic cascade. Elevated intracellular calcium mediates second messenger systems that lead to activa- tion of proteolytic enzymes, xanthine oxidases and phos- pholipases, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS); generates free radicals; initiates apoptosis; and causes additional glutamate release. Inhibiting glutamate receptors, or sodium and calcium channels may also stop this excito- toxic cycle from continuing (Dirnagl et al. , 1999; Endres and Dirnagl, 2002). Free Radicals Free radicals are molecules with one or more unpaired electrons, making them capable of oxidation-reduction reactions. They are produced during ischemia-reperfu- sion (Kontos, 2001) as well as in TBI (Globus et al. , 1995). Superoxide (O 2 − ) is a radical generated by oxidative enzymes during cellular reactions such as aerobic respi- ration and prostaglandin synthesis. Ordinarily, O 2 − pro- duction is minimal but during periods of metabolic stress, its production increases significantly. Superoxide is converted into the very reactive hydroxyl radical by the iron catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction. Under normal con- ditions, superoxide dismutase (SOD) combines O 2 − and H + into molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, thereby protecting cells from the harmful effects of O 2 − . The remaining hydrogen peroxide is broken down by catalase (Nelson et al. , 1992). Much of the damage caused by free radicals is thought to involve the highly reactive molecule peroxynitrite. The reaction between O 2 − and nitric oxide (NO), yielding peroxynitrite, is faster than the scavenging reaction between O 2 − and SOD (Beckman and Koppenol, 1996). Under normal physio- logical conditions, NO concentration is maintained by NO scavengers such as oxy-hemoglobin. During brain injury, however, up regulation of NOS produces excessive NO that is free to react with O 2 − (Stagliano et al. , 1997a; Wada et al. , 1998, 1999; Eliasson et al. , 1999). More detailed descriptions of free radical biology in brain injury have been published (Beckman and Koppenol, 1996; Kontos, 2001). These reactive molecules damage both elements of the CNS parenchyma and blood vessels resulting in cell death, blood-brain barrier (BBB) perme- ability, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation. Inflammation Hematogenous inflammatory cells exacerbate injury by at least two mechanisms. They can form occlusive aggregates in blood vessels after initial reperfusion lead- ing to secondary CBF reductions. They can also con- tribute directly to cell death through cytotoxin production (Danton and Dietrich, 2003). Both of these mechanisms require inflammatory cells to first bind endothelial cells in cerebral vessels, and both are more established in stroke models, but their involvement after TBI is still under investigation (Morganti-Kossmann et al. , 2001). Cell adhesion molecules such as integrins, Neuroprotection 239 Ch14.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 239"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"selectins, and members of the immunoglobulin super- family (IgCAM) permit endothelial-inflammatory cell interactions. Integrins are transmembrane, heterodimeric molecules composed of an α and β subunit. They bind to extracellular matrix components and other adhesion molecules. Selectins are calcium dependent, transmem- brane glycoproteins that bind carbohydrates. L-selectin (CD62-L) and E-selectin (CD62-E) are found on leu- kocytes and endothelial cells, respectively, whereas P-selectin (CD62-P) is found on both platelets and endothelial cells. IgCAMs are transmembrane proteins with an immunoglobulin-like domain that binds other adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix components (del Zoppo, 1997; del Zoppo and Hallenbeck, 2000; Danton and Dietrich, 2003). Evidence has mounted in both experimental and clinical literature that adhesion molecules increase and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) accumulate in vessels. In some models and clini- cal situations, PMNs enter the parenchyma. Increased adhesion molecule expression was reported in rat models of thromboembolic and focal stroke in rats (Okada et al. , 1994; Zhang et al. , 1995b, 1998; Suzuki et al. , 1998; McEver, 2001) and baboons (Okada et al. , 1994). Reports of increased selectins, ICAMs, and vascular cell adhesion molecules (VCAM) are mixed in stroke patients, but these data are difficult to collect (reviewed in Danton and Dietrich, 2003). Inflammatory cell-mediated vascular occlusion was observed using in vivo microscopy through an open cranial window after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Fluorescent leukocytes adhered to vessels and were associated with decreased blood flow (Ritter et al. , 2000). In a baboon model of MCAO, individual and PMN aggregates occluded capil- laries and larger vessels (del Zoppo et al. , 1991). Treatment with antibodies against integrins improved CBF in vessels with diameters between 7.5 and 50 μ m. No difference was noted in neurological score 1 hour after reperfusion, but chronic outcomes were not studied (Mori et al. , 1992). Both clinical and experimental studies sought evi- dence for a cytotoxic role of PMNs. The hypothesis is that PMNs release proteases, phospholipases, NO, hydrogen peroxide, and O 2 – that damage viable tissue within the ischemic penumbra. Histological analysis of rat brains after pMCAO found that leukocytes do migrate into the infarct (Garcia et al. , 1994). Epidemiological studies in patients found that the pres- ence of generalized inflammation, whether from a recent infection or an elevated PMN count, worsens stroke out- come (Suzuki et al. , 1995; Macko et al. , 1996). Leukocyte infiltration was observed in stroke patients using tech- netium-99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime labeled leukocytes and single photon emission computed tomog- raphy. They observed increased signal representing inflammatory cells within brain images after acute stroke, but it is unclear whether these cells remained inside vessels or entered the parenchyma (Wang et al. , 1993). Cerebrospinal fluid analyses from stroke patients demonstrate that leukocytes cross the BBB and that inflammatory response differs between stroke types. PMNs were observed in infarcts with collateral circula- tion, embolic etiology, and lobar hematomas, and not in infarcts without collaterals. Histopathological examina- tion in deceased patients verified some of these findings (Kato et al. , 1995). Apoptosis Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a natural process whereby cells die in an orderly fashion. The process allows organisms to get rid of unneeded cells without release of cytotoxins from dying tissue. Apoptotic cells can generally be observed undergoing chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation in nucleo- some linkage regions, cell shrinkage, and formation of apoptotic bodies (Majno and Joris, 1995; Wang, 2000). Necrosis occurs under toxic conditions in which damage is so severe that death is uncontrolled. Necrosis is char- acterized by ion influx, mitochondria and cell swelling, nonspecific DNA fragmentation, and cell rupture (Wang, 2000). Both necrosis and apoptosis occur in ani- mal models of stroke, TBI, and SCI (Keane et al. , 2001; Katz et al. , 2001; Ozawa et al. , 2002). In stroke models, the core infarct is thought to die via necrosis while cells in the penumbra may undergo apoptosis (Lipton, 1999). Since apoptosis occurs over a period of days through an orderly series of cellular cascades, inhibiting the process may prevent cell death and preserve function. Initiation of apoptosis has been linked to oxidative stresses, DNA damage, and inflammation (Liu et al. , 1999). Numerous members of apoptotic cascades have been identified (Liou et al. , 2003), but caspases are par- ticularly important and well characterized. Caspases are cysteine proteases activated by cleavage and separation of four domains followed by reassembly into a het- erodimeric protein complex. At least 14 caspases have been identified. Some are considered initiators and oth- ers effectors of apoptosis. The intrinsic pathway is cas- pase-mediated and results from mitochondrial permeability and cytochrome c release. Cytochrome c associates with Apaf-1 to permit its association with pro- caspase-9. Once activated in the complex, caspase-9 acti- vates caspase-3, which initiates the rest of the cascade. The extrinsic pathway is initiated by cell surface receptors known as death receptors. Once activated, they form a protein complex that involves activation of procaspase-8. Caspase-8 can activate both caspase-3 and a protein called Bid that induces mitochondrial permeability and 240 Neuroprotection Ch14.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 240"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"the intrinsic cascade. Caspase-independent pathways have also been identified including those activated by proteins AIF, and proteases such as cathepsins, calpains, and granzymes (Phan et al. , 2002; Liou et al. , 2003). ANIMAL MODELS Cell Culture Cells in culture can be made ischemic simply by decreasing oxygen and glucose in culture media. Individual cells, small groups of cultured cells, and organotypic slices can be studied to evaluate individual responses and interactions among neurons. Culture models are useful because they are well-controlled sys- tems where experimental variables can be easily manip- ulated. However, structure, gene expression, and cellular responses may differ between cultured and in vivo cells. In vitro systems may be most useful for studying fundamental aspects of cell biology that are less likely to be altered by culture systems. Unfortunately, it is unclear how results in in vitro sys- tems relate to human disease. Animal models have advantages over in vitro systems because cells are in their natural state. Unfortunately, because manipulating individual variables is difficult, drawing conclusions from animal systems is challenging. To keep the number of variables to a minimum, animal models of human disease are designed to be easily repro- ducible among subjects. This often requires simplifying the insult, which results in the experimental disease being fundamentally different from the human condition. Models are designed so specifically that changing to another breed of the same species may yield different results (Markgraf et al. , 1993). Global Ischemia Global ischemia models reduce blood to the entire brain, mimicking cerebral ischemia from cardiac arrest or severe hypotension. In rats, global ischemia is pro- duced by cardiac arrest or by two-vessel or four-vessel occlusion. Two-vessel occlusion is performed by tying lig- atures around the carotid arteries and dropping mean arterial pressure to 50 mm Hg by controlled exsanguina- tion. Blood is immediately reinfused after 10 minutes and the ligatures removed. Four-vessel occlusion is performed by tying off the vertebral arteries and temporarily occluding the carotid arteries. The cardiac arrest model induces ischemia in a more clinically relevant fashion by pharmacologically inducing cardiac arrest for 7-10 min- utes followed by resuscitation with epinephrine and chest compressions. These injuries result in selective neuronal necrosis of the cortex, basal ganglia, and hippocampus about 3 to 7 days after injury. Because selective neuronal necrosis is delayed, therapies can be tested for their abil- ity to prevent cell death (Dietrich et al. , 1999). Focal Ischemia Focal ischemia models reduce blood supply to specific brain regions by occluding cerebral vessels. A variety of techniques are performed to induce middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. After surgical exposure by craniotomy, the MCA can be ligated with suture (Dietrich et al. , 1989). To perform MCA occlusion with- out a craniotomy, a stiffened suture is inserted into the external carotid, through the internal carotid and up to the MCA base (Belayev et al. , 1996). Photothrombotic MCA occlusion is produced by injecting rats with rose bengal or erythrosine B dye and focusing an argon laser onto the exposed MCA. The laser-dye interactions pro- duce singlet oxygen, a reactive molecule that damages the wall of the vessel by initiating lipid peroxidation. Platelets activate in response to the damage and form an occlusive thrombus (Watson et al. , 1987). Suture models can be studied as permanent or transient occlusion by removing the suture after a specified amount of time. The photothrombotic model also has been studied in permanent and transient models by using an ultraviolet laser to dethrombose the occluded vessel (Watson et al. , 2002). The photothrombotic model was developed to more closely mimic human disease, as the occlusive lesion is a natural platelet clot. Embolic Stroke A variety of models have been developed to study embolic stroke in animals. Nonocclusive common carotid artery thrombosis (CCAT) is produced by con- current injection of rose bengal or erythrosine B and focusing an argon laser onto the common carotid artery of rats and mice. Damage to the carotid wall activates platelets to produce a nonocclusive thrombus that show- ers the distal cerebral vasculature with emboli. Some of the emboli occlude distal cerebral vessels, restrict blood flow, and infarct the supplied tissue. Infarcts from CCAT are generally smaller than those in pure ischemic models and because the mechanism of injury is embolic, there is some variability between animals. CCAT has been used to study cerebrovascular consequences of embolic stroke (Danton et al. , 2002a) and the effects of multiple emboli over time (Danton et al. , 2002b) and to test neuroprotec- tive agents (Stagliano et al. , 1997b). A second common model of thromboembolic stroke involves removing blood from animals and reinjecting the blood into the carotid circulation after permitting it to clot. This model Neuroprotection 241 Ch14.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 241"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"produces primarily fibrin-based clots amenable to ther- apy with tPA (Zivin et al. , 1985). Traumatic Brain Injury Gennerelli (1994) classified models of head injury according to the method of producing injury. F-P and rigid indentation models are characterized by a percus- sion concussion, whereas inertial injury models and impact acceleration models are considered acceleration concussion. The central lateral and parasagittal F-P models are characterized by behavioral responsiveness, metabolic alterations, changes in local cerebral blood flow (lCBF), and blood brain barrier (BBB) permeabil- ity, resulting in behavioral deficits (Dixon et al. , 1987; McIntosh et al. , 1989; Dietrich et al. , 1994). The central F-P model tends to have variable and small contusions in the vicinity of the fluid pulse and scattered axonal dam- age, most limited to the brainstem. In the lateral and parasagittal F-P models (Cortez et al. , 1989; Dietrich et al. , 1994), cortical contusions remote from the impact site are commonly observed. Evidence of axonal damage is seen throughout the white matter tracks ipsilateral to the injury, with tissue tears seen in the gray-white inter- faces (Bramlett et al. , 1997c; Graham et al. , 2000). Depending on the severity of the injury, the F-P model produces a range of disorders including contusion, wide- spread axonal damage, and selective neuronal necrosis. Controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury is another rodent TBI model that produces a well-demarcated cortical con- tusion with variable degrees of hippocampal involve- ment, depending on velocity and deformation (Dixon et al. , 1991). An advantage of the CCI injury is that it can be used in mice and allows for testing of genetically altered animals. Inertial acceleration models produce pure acute sub- dural hematomas and diffuse axonal injury (Gennarelli, 1994). These models are characterized by a variable period of coma and axonal damage in the upper brain- stem and cerebellum. An optic nerve model of traumatic axonal injury has been investigated (Saatman et al. , 2003). This model is advantageous in characterizing the pathophysiology of primary traumatic axonal injury. Although the total human injury condition cannot be addressed adequately with a single animal model, these models are advantageous for investigating a particular feature of human brain injury and uncovering the patho- genesis of the injury cascade. In vitro models have also been developed that can be used to critically investigate the consequences of trauma on a specific cell type in the absence of confounding and systemic cellular factors (Ellis et al. , 1995). Models range from scratching the cell culture with a pipette tip to inducing cellular deforma- tion or stretching cultured cells. Also, combined mechan- ical trauma and metabolic impairment in vivo have helped to clarify mechanisms underlying the cellular response to trauma and the role of specific cell types in these injury mechanisms (Allen et al. , 1999). Spinal Cord Injury Several established models of SCI have been used to clarify the pathophysiology and treatment of ischemia and traumatic injury. These include transection, com- pression, photochemical, and contusion injury models (Prado et al. , 1987; Gruner, 1992; Grill et al. , 1997; Murray et al. , 2002; Park et al. , 2003). The specific model that is chosen for a specific study is best determined by what scientific question is being addressed. For example, if evidence for axonal regeneration after SCI is being investigated, transection models (complete or incom- plete) are advantageous to rigorously assess axonal growth. In contrast, in studies of neuronal protection, compression or contusion models may allow for specific vulnerable neuronal populations to be quantitatively assessed. Finally, SCI models have been developed in mice, taking advantage of genetically manipulated ani- mals (Inman et al. , 2002). NEUROPROTECTIVE DRUGS As already emphasized, ischemic and traumatic insults share many of the same processes that are consid- ered important to cell death mechanisms (Mendelow, 1993). Although the location and severity of the primary insult are important factors to determine the impact of the individual injury process, excitotoxicity, calcium- mediated events, free radicals, mitochondrial damage, inflammation, and apoptosis are commonly discussed as possible targets for therapeutic interventions (Miller, 1985). Sodium Channel Blockers (Table 14.1) Sodium influx occurs at a number of points along the ischemic cascade. Entry through voltage-sensitive chan- nels occurs soon after Na/K pump failure-induced depo- larization. Once sodium concentrations rise, they drive the Na/Ca exchange pump in reverse, allowing calcium to enter the cell as well. Furthermore, after glutamate- induced excitotoxicity, sodium channels open to propa- gate the action potential. These are all potential targets of these agents (Taylor and Meldrum, 1995). Experimental studies were conducted with phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, sipatrigine (619C89), and riluzole. Members of this class were beneficial in gerbil models of global ischemia, rat models of MCAO, and improved both 242 Neuroprotection Ch14.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 242"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"histopathological and behavioral outcomes (Taft et al. , 1989; Pratt et al. , 1992; Rataud et al. , 1994; Smith et al. , 1997b). Sipatrigine demonstrated efficacy in pretreat- ment but not posttreatment studies (Kawaguchi and Graham, 1997; Smith et al. , 1997b). Clinical trials with sipatrigine and fosphenytoin were discontinued without success because of toxicity and lack of efficacy, respec- tively (Smith et al. , 1997b; Muir et al. , 2000). Potassium Channel Modulators (Table 14.1) Drugs such as BMS-204352 open postassium chan- nels, hyperpolarizing neurons and protecting them from excitotoxicity. BMS-204352 opens the calcium-activated, BK channels and voltage-dependent, noninactivating KCNQ channels. Opening potassium channels hyperpo- larizes cells, reversing the depolarized state induced by ischemia. BMS-204352 decreased infarct volume in a rat model of proximal MCAO (Gribkoff et al. , 2001) but showed no efficacy in Phase III trials (Mackay, 2001; Jensen, 2002). Calcium Channel Blockers (Table 14.1) Once depolarized, calcium enters damaged neurons through a variety of channels including voltage-gated L-type Ca channels (Pisani et al. , 1998), N -methyl- D - aspartate (NMDA)-sensitive ligand-gated channels, and release from intracellular stores. Calcium contributes to cell death by mediating a variety of toxic cascades. Activated proteolytic enzymes cleave cytoskeletal pro- teins that form intracellular aggregates. Calcium-medi- ated lipolysis damages membranes and provides fatty acid substrates for free radical production. Increased intracellular calcium facilitates mitochondrial permeabil- ity, activating apoptotic cascades. Calcium-dependent exocytosis facilitates glutamate release, which forms the basis of the excitotoxicity hypothesis. As potential thera- pies toward all these processes, calcium channel blockers have been avidly pursued as neuroprotectives and tested in a variety of models. (S)-emopamil is a phenylalkylamine with additional 5-HT2 activity. Pretreatment with (S)-emopamil improved neuronal survival by about twofold after global ischemia in rats, but was not effective when administered 30 minutes after treatment (Lin et al. , 1990). After pMCAO, (S)-emopamil decreased infarct volume when administered up to 1 hour after onset of ischemia (Nakayama et al. , 1988). Nimodipine is a commonly used calcium channel blocker for treating hypertension and has been studied as a neuroprotectant in animal models (Bielenberg and Beck, 1991b; Yasui and Kawasaki, 1994) and clinical tri- als (Gelmers et al. , 1988). Nimodipine limits ischemic damage to neurons in culture (Pisani et al. , 1998) and in hippocampal slices (Yasui and Kawasaki, 1994; Wassmann et al. , 1996). It decreased infarct volume by 50% at 48 hours in a rat model when given in multiple doses starting before pMCAO (Bielenberg and Beck, 1991a). Experimental trials were mixed, however, as no benefit was observed after 20 minutes of four-vessel occlusion global ischemia (Vibulsresth et al. , 1987). A variety of clinical trials were conducted with nimodipine after stroke and TBI. At least 14 trials of nimodipine in ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hem- orrhage have been conducted since 1982. Nine ischemic stroke trials reported no effect, one reported short-term worse outcome with treatment, and four trials reported positive outcome. Positive outcomes included improved survival in men (Gelmers et al. , 1988), memory (Sze et al. , 1998), clinical course (Gelmers, 1984), and Mathew score among certain subgroups (Martinez-Vila et al. , 1990). Two clinical trials with flunarizine found no statistically significant improvement in outcome (Limburg and Hijdra, 1990; Franke et al. , 1996). A meta-analysis of 29 trials totaling 7665 patients treated with calcium channel blockers found no benefit for ischemic stroke (Horn and Limburg, 2001). At least three trials of nimodipine in TBI found no statistical benefit, except for the subgroup of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (Bailey et al. , 1991; Teasdale et al. , 1992; Murray et al. , 1996). Five tri- als designed to study subarachnoid hemorrhage found statistically significant benefits for nimodipine use in these patients. Improvements were noted in mortality and short- and long-term outcome (Allen et al. , 1983; Neil- Dwyer et al. , 1987; Jan et al. , 1988; Ohman et al. , 1991).

It prevents glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in neuron cultures by reducing intracellular calcium con- centration (Frandsen and Schousboe, 1991). In animal models, it reduced cortical necrosis by 85% to 95% after MCAO in rats (Hong and Chiou, 1998) and protected against delayed neuronal death in gerbils (Zhang et al. , 1993b), but had no effect after 11 minutes of complete ischemia in dogs (Kross et al. , 1993). NMDA Antagonists (Table 14.2) The NMDA receptor is an inotropic, calcium-con- ducting receptor considered to be the main contributor to glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity (Dietrich et al. , 1992a, 1992b; Nakamura et al. , 1993). It rests on the postsynaptic membrane, and if the cell is already depo- larized, glutamate binding opens the pore, allowing cal- cium entry. A number of antagonists have been studied in experimental and clinical trials (Lees, 1997; Clark and Lutsep, 1999; Jain, 2000; Ovbiagele et al. , 2003). Although animal studies were very promising, most clin- ical trials were stopped because of phencyclidine-like effects such as hallucinations and agitation. The noncompetitive antagonist MK-801 (dizocilpine) improved outcome in models of focal ischemia, produc- ing either no effect or between 13% and 78% reduction in infarct volume, depending on experimental conditions (Dirnagl et al. , 1990; Buchan et al. , 1992; McCulloch et al. , 1993; Valtysson et al. , 1994; Margaill et al. , 1996). For example, age-related changes altered drug efficacy as MK-801 reduced infarct volume in young rats, but not in aged rats (Suzuki et al. , 2003b). In models of global ischemia, significant improvements in CA1 neu- ron survival and behavioral improvement were observed, especially when combined with hypothermia (Lin et al. , 1993; Green et al. , 1995; Dietrich et al. , 1995a). However, beneficial findings have not been observed consistently in all models. No benefit was observed in a rat model of photothrombotic MCA occlusion (Yao et al. , 1993) or following transient focal ischemia in pri- mates (Auer et al. , 1996). Both MK-801 and dextromor- phan, another noncompetitive NMDA inhibitor, exhibited protective effects in experimental studies, but clinical trials were terminated early because of phency- clidine-like side effects and lack of efficacy (Kermer et al. , 1999; Jain, 2000). Aptiganel (Cerestat, CNS1102) is a noncompetitive NMDA antagonist that decreases infarct volume and behavioral deficits when administered up to 120 minutes after MCAO (Pitsikas et al. , 2001). Safety and tolerability studies in patients found neuroprotective plasma levels in healthy volunteers and patients with ischemic stroke (Dyker et al. , 1999). Unfortunately, a Phase III clinical trial of aptiganel treatment within 6 hours of stroke onset was terminated early because of a lack of efficacy and a trend toward higher mortality in treated patients. CP101,606 (ceresine) is a noncompetitive NMDA antagonist selective for the NR2B subunit. CP101,606 improved behavioral outcome and decreased infarction volume between 20% and 30% 2 hours after thromboem- bolic stroke in rats (Yang et al. , 2003). A 63% reduction in infarct volume was observed in a feline model of focal ischemia with pretreatment and continuous infusion (Di et al. , 1997). Initial trials found that CP101,606 was well tolerated in patients with TBI and intracerebral hemorrhage (Merchant et al. , 1999; Bullock et al. , 1999; Jain, 2000). The NMDA antagonists selfotel, eliprodil, and NPS- 1506 also demonstrated efficacy in animal models. Selfotel (CGS 19755) is a competitive NMDA antagonist that was discontinued after two Phase III trials found no beneficial effect (Davis et al. , 1997). Eliprodil is a com- bined competitive NMDA antagonist and calcium chan- nel blocker. It reduced neurological deficit and infarct volume by about 50% in rats with thromboembolic 244 Neuroprotection TABLE 14.2 Neuroprotective Agents Targeting Excitotoxicity Drug Reference NMDA Antagonists MK-801 (Dietrich et al. , 1992a; Green et al. , 1995; Dietrich et al. , 1995a; De Vry et al. , 2001) Aptiganel (Lees, 1997; Dyker et al. , 1999) CP101,606 (Di et al. , 1997) (Bullock et al. , 1999; Merchant et al. , 1999) Eliprodil (Lees, 1997) NPS-1506 (Mueller et al. , 1999) Magnesium (Muir, 2002) AMPA Antagonists (Akins and Atkinson, 2002) YM-872 (Kawasaki-Yatsugi et al. , 2000; Suzuki et al. , 2003b; Furukawa et al. , 2003) NAALADase Inhibitors GPI5232 (Williams et al. , 2001) 2-PMPA (Slusher et al. , 1999; Vornov et al. , 1999; Tortella et al. , 2000) GABA Agonists Clomethiazole (Endres and Dirnagl, 2002) (Lyden et al. , 2002) Diazepam (Endres and Dirnagl, 2002) Glycine Antagonists Gavistinel (Sacco et al. , 2001) Licostinel (Albers et al. , 1999) Ch14.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 244"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"stroke. The combination of eliprodil and tPA reduced deficit by 70% and infarct volume by 89%. A Phase III trial was terminated, however, because of a lack of effi- cacy (Jain, 2000). NPS-1506 is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist that inhibits active channels in a volt- age-dependent fashion. It was neuroprotective in animal models for hemorrhagic stroke, tMCAO, and pMCAO, with between a 33% and 57% decrease in infarct volume at effective doses. Phase I trials were completed and found no PCP-like side effects at neuroprotective doses (Mueller et al. , 1999). Glycine Antagonists (Table 14.2) Glycine is an obligatory coagonist at NMDA recep- tors. Instead of antagonizing the NMDA receptor at the glutamate site, the glycine-binding site can be blocked without causing phencyclidine-like side effects. Despite reducing infarct volume by up to 48% after MCAO in rats, gavistinel (GV150526) had no benefits in patient mortality in the GAIN Phase III clinical trial (Sacco et al. , 2001). A second glycine antagonist, licostinel (ACEA 1021), was reported to be well toler- ated in acute stroke patients (Albers et al. , 1999), although there were questions of crystal formation in patients’ urine. AMPA Antagonists (Table 14.2) AMPA receptors bind glutamate on the postsynaptic membrane and gate both sodium and potassium cur- rents. Antagonists to this receptor might inhibit or reduce glutamate-mediated depolarization, thereby reducing NMDA receptor activation. YM-872 (zonam- panel) administered up to 2 hours after pMCAO and tMCAO decreased infarct volume and neurological deficit by 30% to 40% at 1 week (Takahashi et al. , 1998; Kawasaki-Yatsugi et al. , 2000). YM-872 also improved outcome in a rat model of thromboembolic stroke and enhanced tPA efficacy (Suzuki et al. , 2003b). Overall, animal models have reported between a 20% and 60% decrease in infarct volumes (Ovbiagele et al. , 2003). After lateral fluid percussion injury in rats, YM-872 adminis- tered for 4 hours beginning 15 minutes after injury improved histological and behavioral outcome at 1 and 2 weeks (Furukawa et al. , 2003). YM-872 is being studied in two large clinical trials, the AMPA Receptor Antagonist Treatment in Ischemic Stroke Trial (ARTIST + ) and AMPA Receptor Antagonist Treatment in Ischemic Stroke (ARTIST MRI). The ARTIST + trial compares tPA with and with- out YM-872 treatment. The ARTIST MRI trial is mea- suring outcome at 28 days by T2-weighted MRI with FLAIR and at 90 days by clinical criteria. N -acetylaspartylglutamate Inhibitors (Table 14.2) N -acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) is a stored form of glutamate, released by the enzyme N -acetylated- α - linked acidic dipetidase (NAALADase). Inhibitors of NAALADase include 2-PMPA (2-(phosphonomethyl) pentanedioic acid and a more lipophilic analog GPI5232. By decreasing conversion of NAAG, they stoichiometri- cally decrease glutamate release and are neuroprotective in neuron culture as well after tMCAO (decreased infarct volume around 50%) (Slusher et al. , 1999; Vornov et al. , 1999; Tortella et al. , 2000; Williams et al. , 2001). Metabotropic Glutamate Modulators (Table 14.2) There are eight subtypes of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGLUR), which are divided into three groups. The group I mGLURs (mGLUR 1 and 5) activate the phosphoinositide cascade, which leads to opening of Ca ++ and K + channels. mGLUR5 potentiates NMDA receptor activation, which may be the mechanism of group I mGLUR antagonist neuroprotection. Groups II and III depress intracellular systems such as adenylate cyclase and Ca ++ entry. Therefore, their agonists tend to be neuroprotective. Group II agonists require glia for their neuroprotective effects, whereas group III agonists work well in neuronal culture alone. Because group II receptor antagonists do not interfere with normal neu- rotransmission, they are not expected to have side effects similar to other glutamate antagonists. At least nine group I antagonists, six group II agonists, and three group III agonists demonstrated neuroprotective proper- ties. BAY 36-7620 is a recently developed group I antag- onist with oral bioavailability and good BBB penetration (Flor et al. , 2002). It was neuroprotective after subdural hematoma in rats but statistical significance was not reached after MCAO (De Vry et al. , 2001). Magnesium (Table 14.2) Magnesium essentially targets the rise in intracellular Ca ++ . By blocking the gating mechanism of channels, it inhibits Ca ++ influx through voltage-gated Ca channels and NMDA receptors. Magnesium also inhibits cortical spreading depression and neurotransmitter release, and it promotes vasodilation (Ovbiagele et al. , 2003). It is particularly appealing because of its low cost, wide- spread availability, and relative safety. Magnesium was protective in models of thromboembolic, tMCAO, and pMCAO, with decreases in infarct volume between 25% and 61%. At least six clinical trials showed promise for magnesium therapy (Muir, 2002). Three large clinical trials in stroke are underway to further evaluate magne- sium’s efficacy. The Intravenous Magnesium Efficacy in Neuroprotection 245 Ch14.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 245"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Stroke (IMAGES) trial is recruiting 2700 patients to assess death and disability when magnesium is adminis- tered within 12 hours after stroke onset. The Magnetic Resonance in Intravenous Magnesium Efficacy in Stroke Trial (MR Images) will determine the ability of Mg to reduce infarct volume determined by MRI. The Field Administration of Stroke Therapy-Magnesium Phase III Trial (FAST-MAG) will examine whether magnesium is effective when administered by ambu- lance personnel between 15 minutes and 2 hours after symptom onset. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel assignment trial is currently recruiting patients for a magnesium trial following TBI as well. γ -Aminobutyric Acid Agonists (Table 14.2) γ -Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neuro- transmitter thought to oppose glutamate-mediated exci- totoxicity by opening a Cl-1 channel. GABA agonists were found to be neuroprotective in global and focal ischemia (reviewed in Schwartz-Bloom and Sah, 2001). Clomethiazole was the most recent candidate for GABA therapy. The Phase II Clomethiazole Acute Stroke Study (CLASS) found no benefit, but the drug was well toler- ated. Phase III trials called the Clomethiazole Acute Stroke Study in Ischemic, Hemorrhagic, and tPA-treated Patients were discontinued after demonstrating no effi- cacy (Lyden et al. , 2002). Serotonin Antagonists (Table 14.3) Serotonin (5-HT) is released from activated platelets and elevated levels were observed after CCAT and global ischemia (Wester et al. , 1992). Atherosclerosis and carotid stenosis impair vascular dilation, making cere- bral vessels susceptible to serotonin-mediated constric- tion (Ringelstein et al. , 1992; Gur et al. , 1996; White and Markus, 1997). Antagonists such as sarpogrelate, ketanserin, and ritanserin have been studied to prevent pathological vasoconstriction (Danton et al. , 2002c). Ketanserin normalizes local CBF after photochemically induced cortical infarction (Dietrich et al. , 1989a). Ritanserin improved histopathological outcome after transient global ischemia (Globus et al. , 1992) and improved CBF after photothrombotic focal ischemia (Back et al. , 1998), but it had no benefit during pMCAO (Takagi et al. , 1994). Clinical trials using serotonin antagonists suggest that they can be used safely. Ketanserin effectively reduced vascular morbidity by 23% in a trial of 3899 patients more than 40 years old with intermittent claudication. Unfortunately, there was an adverse reaction in patients using diuretics that resulted in a number of deaths (Prevention of Atherosclerotic Complications,1989). Sarpogrelate decreased platelet-derived aggregates, solu- ble adhesion molecules, and thrombomodulin in patients with diabetes mellitus, suggesting that this treatment strategy may prevent thrombotic complications in at-risk patients (Shouzu et al. , 2000). Patients with hemody- namic disturbances, risk factors for platelet aggregation and embolization, may be most likely to benefit from this treatment strategy. Adenosine Agonists (Table 14.3) Adenosine has antiplatelet properties and inhibits neuronal activity and excitotoxicity by binding to the A1 receptor. Adenosine-targeted drugs may act directly on adenosine receptors (A1, A2a, A2b, A3) or increase endogenous adenosine by inhibiting reuptake and break- down. The adenosine-regulating agent acadesine reduced platelet deposition after CCAT and tended to decrease infarct areas (Dietrich et al. , 1995b). The adenosine kinase inhibitor GP683 decreased infarct size in rats when administered 30 minutes after tMCAO, demon- strating its usefulness in focal ischemia (Tatlisumak et al. , 1998a). Adenosine agonists have been studied in clinical trials. A Phase III clinical trial with acadesine during coronary bypass surgery reported an 88% reduction in cardiovas- cular mortality (Mullane, 1993). The European Stroke Prevention Study-2 reported a reduction in stroke with either aspirin (18%), dipyridamole (16%), or combina- tion therapy (37%). Both aspirin and dipyridamole are 246 Neuroprotection TABLE 14.3 Neuroprotective Agents Targeting Vascular Disease Drug References Serotonin Antagonists Ketanserin (Dietrich et al. , 1989a) Ritanserin (Back et al. , 1998) Sarpogrelate (Danton et al. , 2002c) (Shouzu et al. , 2000) Adenosine Agonists GP683 (Tatlisumak et al. , 1998b) Acadesine (Dietrich et al. , 1995b) Anti-Adhesion Molecules Enlimomab (Use of anti-ICAM-1 therapy, 2001) Matrix Mettaloproteinase Inhibitors Batimistat (Asahi et al. , 2000) KB-R7785 (Jiang et al. , 2001) BB-1101 (Rosenberg et al. , 1998) HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Danton et al. , 2002) Ch14.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 246"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"platelet inhibitors, but dipyridamole’s effects may be due to an increased level of endogenous adenosine (Picano and Abbracchio, 1998). Free Radical Scavengers (Table 14.4) Free radicals are molecules with one or more unpaired electrons that participate in oxidation-reduction reac- tions. They are produced during ischemia-reperfusion, diffuse into neighboring tissue, and damage blood ves- sels, neurons, and glia. Vascular damage from these mol- ecules may promote BBB permeability, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation. Free radicals react with NO produced by NOS isoenzymes to form peroxynitrite, a highly reactive molecule. More detailed descriptions of free radical biology following ischemia and the role of NO in these reactions have been reviewed elsewhere (Beckman and Koppenol, 1996; Kontos, 2001). Free radical scavengers protect both the cerebral vas- culature and the brain parenchyma. Most agents have been successfully used as pretreatment or immediate posttreatment strategies. There are some experimental data on the use of these agents at longer intervals after injury. For example, U-101033E significantly reduced infarction size at 4 hours but not at 24 hours after pMCAO (Hall et al. , 1996). NXY-059 reduced infarct size when administered 3 hours after tMCAO. Treatment at 6 hours, but NOT at 3 hours, improved behavioral deficits at 1 day but not at 2 days after injury. The scav- enger PBN successfully reduced BBB permeability and infarct size 12 hours after focal ischemia (Cao and Phillis, 1994). Early treatment with the lipid peroxidation inhibitor LY341122 improved histopathological outcome after moderate fluid percussion brain injury in rats by up to 60% (Wada et al. , 1999a). Although most agents were tested in rodent models, NXY-059 has successfully improved the behavioral and histopathological conse- quences of pMCAO in marmosets (Marshall et al. , 2001), raising hopes that these treatments will be clini- cally applicable. Clinical trials have had limited success following acute ischemic stroke but have had more success treating sub- arachnoid hemorrhage. Patients administered nicaraven 5 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage had a reduced incidence of delayed ischemic neurological deficits. A number of trials examined tirilazad after stroke and a consensus group determined that patients were likely worse off in the treated groups. Numerous side effects may have complicated any benefit of the drug (Tirilazad International Steering Committee, 2000). The iron chela- tor deferoxamine improved endothelial-dependent dila- tion in patients with coronary artery disease (Duffy et al. , 2001). Dysfunctional endothelial-dependent dilation of the MCA in rats was observed after CCAT and is a complication found in some patients with cerebrovas- cular disease. Selected groups of patients with these dis- ease processes may benefit from free radical scavenger therapy. Methylprednisolone Clinically, the corticosteroid and anti-inflammatory agent, methylprednisolone (MP) is the recommended drug for administration following SCI in the United States (Bracken et al. , 1990, 1992). Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, MP has been reported to decrease oxygen radical-induced lipid peroxidation, inhibit eicosanoid formation, increase CBF, improve reversal of intracellular Ca ++ accumulation, and enhance synaptic transmission (Hall, 1982, 1992; Young and Flamm, 1982; Anderson et al. , 1985). In experimental and clinical studies, MP has been shown to improve out- come when given in the first hours after injury. However, there is a critical need to develop and test other novel therapeutic strategies that may be used in the clinical arena. Therapeutic strategies that are neuroprotective in the acute injury setting may also be used in conjunction with cellular transplantation and regeneration experi- ments to promote recovery in the chronic injury setting. Anti-adhesion Molecule Therapy (Table 14.3) Targeting the hematogenous inflammatory response has primarily focused on up regulated adhesion mole- cules. In models of tMCAO, pretreatment and posttreat- ment with antiselectin antibodies successfully decreased infarct volume up to 70% after 2 hours and improved CBF (Connolly et al. , 1997; Goussev et al. , 1998).

Cotreatment with the granulo- cyte-depleting antibody RB6-8C5 further improved out- come (Zhang et al. , 1995a). Recently, a clinical trial of the murine anti-ICAM-1 antibody Enlimomab worsened neurological score and mortality in patients (Use of anti- ICAM-1 therapy, 2001). A follow-up study using the murine anti-rat ICAM-1 antibody in rats also found an increase in infarct volume and no efficacy. It is believed that immune activation in response to the foreign mouse protein probably accounted for the clinical and follow-up experimental results (Furuya et al. , 2001). Modifications of the antiadhesion molecule therapy might make this strategy worthwhile. Matrix Metalloproteinases (Table 14.3) Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are angiogenic enzymes that break down components of the extracellu- lar matrix. Although angiogenesis seems like a potential benefit, MMPs may enhance BBB breakdown after stroke and increase inflammation. MMP inhibitors such as batimistat (BB-94) and KB-R7785 decreased infarct volume in mice following permanent focal ischemia (Asahi et al. , 2000; Jiang et al. , 2001). BB-1101 reduced edema 24 hours after focal ischemia in rats and reduced hemorrhage in both rats and rabbits (Rosenberg et al. , 1998; Lapchak et al. , 2000; Sumii et al. , 2002). MMP inhibitors have been evaluated in patients for their antiangiogenesis properties in cancer treatment and are well tolerated in patients (Hidalgo and Eckhardt, 2001). Antiapoptosis Agents (Table 14.5) As previously described, caspases play a major role in both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways and are a prime target for therapeutic development (Schulz et al. , 1999). Caspase inhibitors have worked in a variety of brain injury models. In a model of neonatal hypoxia- ischemia, administration of the pan-caspase inhibitor boc-aspartyl(OMe)-fluoromethylketone was significantly neuroprotective when given up to 3 hours after the insult (Cheng et al. , 1998). The caspase inhibitor N -benzyloxy- carbonyl-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-fluo- romethylketone attenuated postischemic caspase-3-like enzymatic activity and blocked delayed neuron loss in the hippocampus (Gillardon et al. , 1999). Treatment with Z-VAL-Ala-Asp (Ome)-FMK (zVAD) improved neuro- logical outcome after cardiac arrest in rats (Katz et al. , 2001). Improved outcomes have also been noted in mod- els of tMCAO and pMCAO (Schulz et al. , 1999). Cyclosporin A and FK-506 are immunosuppressive agents that inhibit calcineurin and have mixed results suggesting antiapoptotic effects (Herr et al. , 1999; Ovbiagele et al. , 2003; Yardin et al. , 1998). Using isolated brain mitochondria, cyclosporin A prevented mitochon- drial permeability transition under partial but not strong depolarization. This suggests that cyclosporin A is an effective apoptosis inhibitor under limited conditions (Brustovetsky and Dubinsky, 2000). In neuron cultures, FK506 and not cyclosporin A blocked neuronal apopto- sis induced by serum deprivation (Yardin et al. , 1998). FK-506 decreased infarct volume in rodent models of pMCAO and tMCAO and improved cell density after global ischemia. The therapeutic window in these studies ranged from 60 to 240 minutes and benefit was noted between 1 and 2 weeks depending on the model (Furuichi et al. , 2003). It also inhibited release of ceramide (a medi- ator of apoptosis) and apoptosis in both in vitro and in vivo stroke models (Herr et al. , 1999). FK506 reduced axonal injury in a model of impact acceleration TBI in rats (Singleton et al. , 2001). Cyclosporin A also reduced lesion volume in models of tMCAO, forebrain ischemia, and optic nerve crush injury (Shiga et al. , 1992; Uchino et al. , 1995; Rosenstiel et al. , 2003). Although it is clear that these agents have neuroprotective properties, the mechanism is not conclusively understood. Neutrophil activating protein (NAP) is a synthetic vasoactive intestinal peptide analog with sequences simi- lar to neuroprotective proteins. NAP significantly reduced motor disability and infarct volumes 24 hours after stroke onset. NAP was effective when administered 4 but not 6 hours after pMCAO and was effective up to 30 hours. Histological analysis found that NAP signifi- cantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells (Leker et al. , 2002). Nitric Oxide Inhibitors (Table 14.5) NOS consist of three isoenzymes, neuronal (nNOS or type I), inducible (iNOS or type II), and endothelial (eNOS or type III). nNOS is calcium activated, PDZ domain associated and found in all brain regions, as well as skeletal muscle, prostate, pancreas, and testis (Park et al. , 2000). iNOS is calcium independent, soluble, and, with a few exceptions in peripheral tissues, is expressed when induced by cell stressors (Park et al. , 2000). eNOS is 248 Neuroprotection TABLE 14.5 Other Neuroprotective Agents under Investigation Drug References Caffeine and Alcohol (Piriyawat et al. , 2003) (Aronowski et al. , 2003) Caspase inhibitors (Schulz et al. , 1999) Cyclosporin (Shiga et al. , 1992; Uchino et al. , 1995) FK506 (Singleton et al. , 2001; Furuichi et al. , 2003) cNOS inhibitors (Wada et al. , 1998a, 1998b; Wada et al. , 1999b) Ch14.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 248"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"calcium activated, membrane bound via palmitoylation and myristoylation sites, and associates with calveolin. nNOS and iNOS are thought to be hazardous in the setting of stroke, TBI, and SCI, whereas eNOS has ben- eficial effects through vasodilation and maintaining per- fusion. To evaluate the effect of eNOS inhibition on cerebral vessels, the nonspecific NOS inhibitor NG- nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) was infused intra-arterially and blood vessels visualized with in situ microscopy. Pial arteries constricted and cor- tical CBF decreased by 72.5%. Ultrastructurally, microvascular stasis and BBB disruption occurred as well (Prado et al. , 1992). L-NAME increased infarct volumes between 103% and 176%, depending on brain region after MCAO (Kuluz et al. , 1993). Following CCAT in rats, L-NAME worsened sensorimotor (forelimb plac- ing) and cognitive (water maze) tasks, and the selective nNOS inhibitor 3-bromo-7-nitroindazole (7-NI) acceler- ated sensorimotor recovery and improved histopatholog- ical outcome (Stagliano et al. , 1997a). Using a functional assay, cNOS activity (eNOS and nNOS) increased within 5 minutes after TBI by 234% and returned to control val- ues by 30 minutes. cNOS activity was reduced 1 day after TBI to about 50% and remained low for up to 7 days. Pretreatment but not posttreatment with 7-NI decreased contusion volume (Wada et al. , 1998a) and improved sensorimotor function after TBI in rats (Wada et al. , 1999b). These data strongly support beneficial roles for eNOS and detrimental roles for nNOS. The iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine was used to determine the effect of iNOS inhibition after TBI. Although aminoguanidine did not reduce contusion vol- ume, it did reduce the number of necrotic neurons (Wada et al. , 1998b). In functional assays following TBI, iNOS activity increased more than 275% by 3 days and more than 600% by 7 days. Immunostaining for iNOS and glial fibrillary acidic protein to identify astrocytes at 3 and 7 days found that most iNOS expression was in both astro- cytes and macrophages within the subarachnoid space. iNOS was first hypothesized to play a role in SCI when the transcription nuclear factor-(NF) κ B activation was observed after SCI. NF- κ B is required for iNOS expres- sion (Bethea et al. , 1998). Recently cNOS activity was increased by 6 hours and then decreased. iNOS activity was elevated at all time points after SCI. Acute adminis- tration of aminoguanidine significantly improved func- tional and histopathological outcome (Chatzipanteli et al. , 2002). Caffeine and Alcohol (Table 14.5) Despite the ability of caffeine and alcohol to constrict cerebral blood vessels (Nehlig et al. , 1992; Zhang et al. , 1993a), the combination is neuroprotective after ischemic stroke. After tMCAO in rats, treatment with ethanol plus caffeine administered between 30 and 120 minutes postis- chemia decreases infarct volume by 71.7% and 47.1%, respectively. However, chronic daily oral ethanol plus caf- feine before ischemia eliminated the neuroprotection seen with acute treatment (Strong et al. , 2000). Outcome was further improved when caffeine and alcohol at con- centrations comparable to 2 to 3 cups of strong coffee and a cocktail were combined with hypothermia. In addi- tion, there was no increase in hemorrhage when com- bined with tPA (Aronowski et al. , 2003). A pilot study in patients found that the combination can be safely given and neuroprotective concentrations were reached (Piriyawat et al. , 2003). An outcomes trial needs to be planned before instituting the public service announce- ment, “Rum and Coke when you’re having a stroke.” PITFALLS OF CLINICAL TRIALS (TABLE 14.6) Once evidence for a therapeutic strategy has mounted in animal experiments, it may be attempted in clinical tri- als. Kidwell et al. (2001) reviewed 178 clinical trials for ischemic stroke from 1990 to 1999, over half of which studied neuroprotective agents. Although 23% reported benefits, the investigators found that less than 2% met strict criteria defining them as having a positive outcome. According to Faden (2002), the past 50 years of clinical trials in TBI resulted in no convincing evidence of a ben- eficial neuroprotective agent. With these realizations, investigators began a great deal of introspection into fundamental methods of research to assess reasons for discrepancy between preclinical and clinical out- comes (Faden, 2001; Gladstone et al. , 2002). A number Neuroprotection 249 TABLE 14.6 Why Neuroprotective Agents Work in Animal Models and Not in Patients Experiments are not repeated by different investigators. Many animal experiments do not evaluate the therapeutic window to determine if the treatment will be clinically feasible. Animal experiments use histopathology while clinical investigations use functional outcomes. Adverse side effects are not adequately studied. Therapeutic doses are not achieved and may be further attenuated by blood-brain barrier impermeability. Therapies target pathomechanisms that are not common to all stroke patients. Patients with different types of stroke damage are combined in the same study. Outcome measures are not standardized, sensitive, and well defined. Therapies may be influenced by gender, age, and other individual differences.

Animal Models Anesthesia Almost all animal protocols require the use of anes- thesia in any situation that causes pain to the experimen- tal animal. Although the use of anesthesia is necessary for humanitarian reasons, volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane and halothane reduced infarct volumes early after focal ischemia and limited selective neuronal necro- sis at 14 days (Kawaguchi et al. , 2000; Xiong et al. , 2003). Using anesthesia and a neuroprotective agent is a combi- nation therapy that is unavoidable in most preclinical studies but must be kept in mind when translating results to patients. Dosing Drug doses used in clinical trials often are based on animal studies. Determining minimally effective doses entails generating dose-response curves in multiple injury models by different groups of investigators. Generating dose-response curves is frequently overlooked because doing so quickly increases experimental cost in terms of time, personnel, materials, and number of animals. However, this determination is critical as are detecting any hazards of using higher or lower doses. Small-animal studies are not ideal for detecting harmful side effects because small animals tolerate drugs very well, are not routinely examined for systemic side effects, and are fre- quently sacrificed early after treatment; thus long-term consequences are unknown. To address these issues, the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) recommended generating dose-response curves in models of both small and large animals (NIH Consensus Development Panel, 1999b). The more species tested, the more likely investigators are to detect harmful side effects. In addition, larger animals might be more prone to developing side effects similar to those of humans. Difficulties in dosing and side effects were particularly marked in studies with the glutamate receptor antago- nists Selfotel (CGS 19755) and MK-801. Doses of Selfotel at approximately 40 mg/kg were neuroprotective in a variety of animals, including gerbil (Boast et al. , 1988) and rabbit models of ischemia (Perez-Pinzon et al. , 1995). However, Phase IIa trials found the limit of safe doses in patients with stroke to be 1.5 mg/kg (Grotta et al. , 1995). Higher doses led to psychotomimetic effects characteristic of glutamate receptor antagonists. Trials with the agent continued and two Phase III trials were eventually suspended because of an early increase in mortality in the Selfotel-treated group and a trend toward increased 90-day mortality (Davis et al. , 2000). Dawson et al. (2001) retrospectively studied side effects of glutamate receptor antagonists, including Selfotel in rats following pMCAO. They used a vestibulomotor test (rotorod) to evaluate adverse neurological effects. They determined that agents such as Selfotel have detectable side effects giving them therapeutic ratios of less than 1, while more promising neuroprotective thera- pies have ratios greater than 1. Careful detection of side effects and the generation of dose-response curves may prevent drugs that are bound for failure from going to clinical trials. Modifying neuroprotective strategies based on therapeutic ratios may improve clinical trial success rate. It is hoped that improvements in clinical trial design will alleviate some of these problems. Lees (2002) sum- marized a new design for clinical trials. Adaptive ran- domization design is a technique based on Bayesian statistics (Malakoff, 1999) that allows trial designers to use fewer patients in determining minimal effective doses. Although these techniques are not appropriate for conclusions regarding efficacy they will reduce numbers of inadequately or over-treated patients (Lees, 2002). Therapeutic Window Therapeutic window is the time range between injury and treatment during which the treatment is still effec- tive. Time windows for neuroprotective agents that target early injury mechanisms are frequently over before patients can reasonably get treatment. Many therapies work best when administered before and immediately after the insult. Experiments with animal models often begin with a pretreatment protocol. If the therapy works, it is tested at different intervals from injury onset. Most effective therapies work best within 15 to 30 minutes; rarely are they effective more than 3 hours after injury (Grotta, 1999). Although there is little reason to assume that the therapeutic window in small animals is the same as the window in humans, less than 3 hours seems to fit both paradigms. Unfortunately, it is difficult to get patients to the hospital, evaluated, and enrolled in a clin- ical trial within 3 hours of symptom onset. More than 17,324 patients were screened to enroll the 624 subjects in the NINDS rt-PA trial, and most were excluded because of the time window. In the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II (ECASS II) that looked at rt-PA therapy with a treatment window between 0 and 6 hours, more than 80% of patients were treated between 3 and 6 hours and no effect was detected (Hacke et al. , 1998). Had the NINDS trial chosen a longer window, a difference might 250 Neuroprotection Ch14.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 250"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"not have been detected, and rt-PA might not have made it to clinical use. To avoid erroneously discarding a bene- ficial therapy, future trials should either strictly enforce enrollment or stratify patients into groups based on time- to-treat. Conducting randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled studies that stratify patients based on time-to-treat will require larger numbers of subjects and take longer to complete. However, these studies may give investigators the best chance of detecting efficacious therapies. Preclinical studies often begin with a pretreatment design to improve chances of detecting an effect. Clinical correlates to pretreatment studies include administering neuroprotective agents to chronically high-risk patients or during procedures that carry risk of stroke such as carotid endarterectomy. Most procedures have relatively small risks of complications, so these studies would likely take a long time to acquire sufficient numbers of sub- jects, but they may help establish the neuroprotective potential of new therapeutics. Therapeutic Targets: The Ischemic Penumbra The ischemic penumbra can be broadly defined as that region of the ischemic zone that is potentially sal- vageable (Astrup et al. , 1981). Because saving the penumbra is a promising treatment strategy, it is the focus of current neuroprotective research in stroke. The penumbra resides around the core infarct and is charac- terized by hemodynamic, metabolic, and molecular alterations (Takagi et al. , 1993; Sharp et al. , 2000). Most of the biochemical and histological descriptions of the penumbra were studied in models of MCA occlu- sion where single large vessel occlusion permits collat- erals to feed areas adjacent to the ischemic focus; this produces a large, well-characterized penumbra amenable to neuroprotective agents. Reductions in CBF after an ischemic or traumatic injury can lead to the generation of propagated or nonpropagated depressions in electrical activity com- monly called cortical spreading depression (Leao, 1944). These ionic events have been shown to con- tribute to neuronal injury in vulnerable brain regions such as the ischemic penumbra (Back et al. , 1994; Busch et al. , 1996; Hossmann, 1996). Therapeutic interventions, including glutamate receptor blockers and therapeutic hypothermia, may act by inhibiting these potentially deleterious ionic events. Strong et al. (2002, 2003) have provided clinical evidence for the presence of cortical spreading depressions in the human cortex after focal injury. Embolic models such as CCAT produce thrombi in the common carotid artery that embolize and occlude both large and small distal vessels. It is unclear whether a significant penumbra exists in these models. Instead of occluding one large vessel and permitting collaterals to feed the “penumbral” region, collateral flow may be reduced by embolic occlusion of collateral vessels. In another rat model of embolic stroke, injected thrombotic clots were observed occluding large vessels at early time points and microvessels at later time points. The authors concluded that the initial clots in large vessels break up and embolize distally to smaller vessels (Wang et al. , 2001). Other subtle pathophysiological features of embolic models have been described. For instance, vasoactive fac- tors produced from thrombotic processes occurring in damaged vessels may reduce flow to significant portions of the cerebral hemisphere, further limiting collateral flow and the penumbral territory (Dietrich et al. , 1991). In addition, platelet embolization results in alterations of vascular reactivity through regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, suggesting that vessels exposed to platelet emboli may have altered hemodynamic control (Danton et al. , 2002a). Preconditioning studies with embolic and ischemic stroke also have illustrated differences between models. After a brief episode of pure ischemia, molecular events occur that protect the brain from future insults in a phe- nomenon known as ischemic preconditioning. When CCAT was followed by global ischemia, the ischemic lesion was much more severe than global ischemia alone, even at sites distant from embolic infarcts (Dietrich et al. , 1999b). In contrast to what is expected of pure ischemia models, these results suggest that platelet embolization makes the brain susceptible to future insults, even in locations that were not infarcted. Human stroke is more likely to have similar properties such as emboli, and it is reasonable to question how these events will affect the presence of a penumbra. Translating experimental animal data to clinical use for humans is made difficult because of the following: (1) differences in anatomy and physiology, (2) differ- ences in pathophysiological response to injury, and (3) differences between injury mechanisms in animal mod- els vs human disease. The first two problems are being addressed by using multiple species in each model. Before going to clinical trials, primates are used to bet- ter predict response in humans. The third problem is addressed by using multiple models. Therapies that work in many models are more likely to target funda- mental pathomechanisms and apply to human disease. Unfortunately, investigators often gain expertise in only a few similar models with questionable applicability to the broad range of human disease. Furthermore, having multiple, independent laboratories replicate studies pro- vides a stronger rationale for moving a therapy to the Neuroprotection 251 Ch14.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 251"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"clinic as the probability of having multiple false-positive studies is reduced. Clinical Studies of the Penumbra Many studies report evidence of penumbral regions in patients after stroke (Hakim et al. , 1989; Schlaug et al. , 1999; Baron, 1999, 2001; Heiss, 2000) and have begun to address these key questions: 1. How can the penumbra be identified? 2. What proportion of stroke patients has a viable penumbra? 3. How large is the ischemic penumbra? 4. How long does the penumbra last? 5. Will saving the penumbra improve outcome? Answers to these basic questions will enable clinicians and investigators to identify patients most likely to bene- fit from neuroprotective therapies. Radiological techniques visualize regions representing ischemic penumbra in some stroke patients. To define a region as the penumbra, hemodynamic and metabolic parameters associated with impending infarction were identified in both animal and human studies. Positron emission tomography (PET) identified tissue with reduced CBF and regional cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO2) that represented infarcted areas and surround- ing regions that may be the penumbra (Hakim et al. , 1989; Heiss, 2000). Baron and colleagues combined PET, repeated CT imaging, and clinical correlations to conclude that penumbral tissue is variably represented in different patients. Penumbra was detected up to 16 hours in some and was absent by 5 hours in other patients (Baron, 1999). Heiss et al. (2001) used PET with 60mCi H215O and 20mCi [11C] used flumazenil to measure both CBF and benzodiazepine receptor (BDZR) density, respectively. BDZR density is used as a marker of neuronal integrity. They established 95% probability limits of infarction (4.8 ± 0.53 ml/100 g/min) and survival (14.1 ± 1.83 ml/100g/min) for CBF and for flumazenil binding. They concluded that measuring these parameters enables iden- tification of brain regions amenable to neuroprotective therapies. In their cohort of 10 patients, 13% of final infarct volume had sufficient CBF and neuronal integrity to be capable of rescue (Heiss et al. , 2001). In three patients, this area was more than 45%, suggesting that some patients are more likely to benefit from neuropro- tective therapies than others. A complication in this study was that patients were assessed an average of 6 hours after onset of symptoms, but one would expect the per- centage of salvageable tissue to decrease over time, par- ticularly after the first 3 hours (Baron, 2001). White vs Gray Matter In addition to damage of the gray matter structures, white matter vulnerability is observed in anoxic, ischemic, and traumatic conditions (Waxman and Ranson, 1997; Dietrich et al. , 1998; Dewar et al. , 1999). Because the normal function of the brain is dependent on the communication between brain regions, clarifica- tion of mechanisms contributing to acute and/or pro- gressive white matter damage is critical to our understanding of brain injury (Pantoni and Garcia, 1995; Pantoni et al. , 1999). Following focal cerebral ischemia, as well as TBI, damage to the white matter tracts can be observed using a variety of immunocyto- chemical markers (Gentleman et al. , 1995; Dietrich et al. , 1998; Gillard et al. , 2001). Preclinical studies have largely focused on protecting gray matter, as rats have a higher ratio of gray to white matter than humans (Gladstone et al. , 2002). Neuropro- tective therapies that work well on gray matter do not necessarily protect white matter. In this regard, one explanation for the lack of successful human stroke trials is that neuroprotective strategies have primarily targeted gray but not white matter structures. For example, MK- 801 was neuroprotective against selective neuronal necro- sis in photothrombotic stroke (Yao et al. , 1994) and in global ischemia (Lin et al. , 1993), but did not attenuate white matter damage in a model of focal ischemia in cats (Yam et al. , 2000). The AMPA antagonist SPD 502 r educed damage in both white and gr ay matter after f ocal ischemia (McCracken et al. , 2002). In the future, MRI techniques that distinguish gray and white matter injuries may be useful to stratify patients for particular therapies that are beneficial against the patient’s particular lesion. Although the majority of neuroprotection studies have concentrated on neuronal preservation, significant progress was also made in the pathophysiology and treat- ment of white matter injury (Fern et al. , 1996; Waxman and Ranson, 1997; Dewar et al. , 1999). A critical role of Ca ++ influx involving persistent Na + channels and the Na + -Ca ++ exchanger has been demonstrated in anoxic CNS white matter injury (Stys et al. , 1992a). L-type and N-type Ca ++ channels also appear to provide routes for the influx of Ca ++ (Fern et al. , 1995). The neurotransmit- ter, GABA, and the neuromodulator, adenosine, have also been shown to play a role in white matter injury (Fern et al. , 1994, 1996). In terms of white matter protection, Na + channel blocking drugs, including tetrodotoxin-TTX and saxi- toxin, provide protection from anoxic injury (Stys et al. , 1992a), as well as a number of antiepileptic drugs includ- ing phenytoin and carbamazepine (Fern et al. , 1993). Use-dependent blockage of Na + channels is a proposed mechanism for neuroprotective actions of antiarrhythmic 252 Neuroprotection Ch14.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 252"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"drugs (Waxman and Ranson, 1997). L-type calcium channel antagonists, verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine have each been reported to protect the optic nerve from anoxic injury (Fern et al. , 1995). Anoxic protection is also seen with drugs that block the Na + -Ca ++ exchanger (Kleyman and Cragoe, 1988; Kaczorowski et al. , 1989). In the area of TBI, recent studies have emphasized both acute and progressive injury mechanisms underly- ing diffuse axonal injury (Povlishock, 1992). These include increased permeability abnormalities (Pettus et al. , 1994), calcium-induced calpain-mediated proteoly- sis (Buki et al. , 1999; Wolf et al. , 2001), as well as caspase activation (Ozawa et al. , 2002). Mitochondrial abnor- malities have also been implicated in axonal perturba- tions following trauma (Okonkwo and Povlishock, 1999). Based on current evidence, white matter changes as a result of anoxic/ischemic or traumatic insults play a crit- ical role in the neuropathological and functional conse- quences of these insults and are important targets for therapeutic interventions (Waxman and Ranson, 1997; Dewar et al. , 2003). Gender-Specific Injury Response Experimental studies frequently use only male ani- mals to reduce variability between mixing genders and to avoid accounting for the estrus cycle in experimental design. Recent data have established gender differences following experimentally induced stroke and TBI (Hurn and Macrae, 2000; Roof and Hall, 2000; Stein, 2001). Models of embolic stroke and global and focal ischemia described reduced injury in intact female vs male rodents (Hall et al. , 1991; Li et al. , 1996; Alkayed et al. , 1998). These data also suggest that ovariec- tomized females have injuries more consistent with males (Alkayed et al. , 1998; Bramlett and Dietrich, 2001). Testosterone was studied by comparing castrated vs intact males and was reported to worsen outcome after focal ischemia (Hawk et al. , 1998). The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study reported that estrogen and progesterone hormone replacement therapy increase risk of stroke (Wassertheil-Smoller et al. , 2003). The estrogen only arm of the study is awaiting completion. Because stroke patients are likely to be postmenopausal, it is unclear whether gender differ- ences relating to estrogen introduce variability into clin- ical trials. Recent experimental data in a model of TBI reported that therapeutic hypothermia does not improve outcome in females as it does in males (Suzuki et al. , 2003a). It is unclear whether these results are sim- ilar in stroke models. Thus gender differences might complicate neuroprotection trials with regard to both outcome and therapeutic response. Patient Selection for Clinical Trials In contrast to preclinical studies using young, healthy animals under controlled physiological conditions, patients present with various stroke etiologies and comorbidities. Therapies targeting penumbra will not work in patients without a penumbra. When patients without a penumbra are enrolled in a study, their lack of improvement may statistically hide any positive effects of treatment. Radiological techniques that can screen for penumbra are being validated for incorporation into clinical trial selection criteria. The combination of diffu- sion-weighted imaging lesion volume, NIHSS score, and time from symptom onset to scanning was recently vali- dated as a predictor of patient outcome (Baird et al. , 2001). The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) divides the MCA territory into 10 sections, and 1 point is subtracted for each section containing hypoattenuation or evidence of early ischemic changes. Thus a normal score is 10 and lesion of the entire MCA territory is 0. A score of less than 7 yielded a 14-fold increase in risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemor- rhage in patients treated with the thrombolytic ateplase, compared with scores above 7 (Barber et al. , 2000). Tools such as these may provide a rapid means of iden- tifying candidate patients. Schlaug et al. (1999) identified penumbra in 25 patients presenting within 24 hours of hemispheric stroke onset, and they operationally defined the penum- bra by comparing diffusion and perfusion MRI. To determine parameters best able to identify penumbral regions at greatest risk of infarction, Schaefer et al. (2003) examined diffusion-weighted and perfusion- weighted images in 30 stroke patients between 1 and 12 hours after symptom onset. Regional CBF distinguished between penumbra that infarcts and hypoperfused tissue that recovers. The combined efforts of these and other investigators are establishing the utility of neuroradio- logical techniques to improve clinical trials and enhance stroke treatment. Outcome Measures Outcome measures are often different between exper- imental trials and clinical trials (Gladstone et al. , 2002). Preclinical studies often evaluate acute injury response, whereas late outcomes are most clinically important. Infarct size may be decreased early after injury but just delayed in progression. Final lesion volume may be the same (Schaefer et al. , 2003). Preclinical studies often use infarct volume to determine efficacy, whereas clinical studies rely on behavioral measures. Behavioral mea- sures were developed to evaluate functional recovery in Neuroprotection 253 Ch14.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 253"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"animals. Rats often regain much of their behavioral functioning over time, even without treatment, and a battery of tests is most effective at detecting persistent deficits. Following CCAT, for example, rats have senso- rimotor (forelimb placing) deficits up to 3 days postin- jury, no difference in vestibulomotor (beam balance) skills, and only subtle impairments in cognitive tasks (Morris water maze) at 48 hours, but not 21 days, post injury (Stagliano et al. , 1997a). Following MCAO, sen- sorimotor deficits recovered by day 30, but cognitive deficits remained up to 5 weeks (Markgraf et al. , 1992). Avoiding these pitfalls ensures that all neuroprotective agents have established acute and chronic histopatho- logical and behavioral benefits (NIH Consensus Development Panel, 1999b). Outcome measures are also problematic when com- paring clinical trials. Duncan et al. (2000) reviewed out- come measures in 51 large neuroprotection trials. Only 29 had defined outcome measures and time frames for their endpoint. There was considerable variability between studies, including 15 different impairment measures, 11 activity measures, 1 quality of life/health status measure, and 8 miscellaneous measures designed by the investiga- tors. Well-defined and standardized outcome measures would aid in meta-analysis and cross-comparisons between trials. Clinical trials are beginning to use objective radiologi- cal data as outcome measures. Physicians agree that func- tional outcomes are most important, but reduced lesion volumes lead to functional improvement. Radiological outcomes could help steer research in appropriate direc- tions by detecting subtle therapeutic benefits. Functional improvements may require substantial tissue salvage best accomplished by multiple therapies, each making small contributions to limit infarction. Therapies that yield a clear radiological benefit but no functional improvement should not be discarded. Reevaluating dosages and time of administration may improve efficacy. Flaws in trial design and patient selection may contribute to failures in detecting improved functional outcome. Warach (2001) argued that clinical trials of 100 to 200 patients using radiological outcomes might have sufficient power to evaluate efficacy, but 5 to 10 times as many patients are required in Phase III trials. Thus studies with radiological outcomes may be a cost-effective approach for deciding whether or not to plan a Phase III trial (Warach, 2001). TEMPERATURE Small variations in brain temperature have profound effects on histopathological and behavioral outcome in models of global and focal cerebral ischemia. Whereas a 2 ̊ C reduction in intraischemic brain temperature is neu- roprotective, a small increase in brain temperature wors- ens outcome (Dietrich et al. , 1990a, 1990b; Dietrich, 2001; Minamisawa et al. , 1990). In an early study by Busto and colleagues (1987), intraischemic hypothermia following transient global ischemia protected the CA1 hippocampus and dorsolateral striatum. In models of cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary bypass, hypother- mia protection has also been reported by various investi- gators (Leonov et al. , 1990). These beneficial effects of cooling on histopathological outcome have been comple- mented by electrophysiological and functional outcome measures. For example, Green and colleagues (1992) reported that intraischemic hypothermia at 30 ̊ C attenu- ated the cognitive and sensory motor consequences of global ischemia. In dogs, mild hypothermia at 34 ̊ C resulted in significant improvement in neurological func- tion at postarrest (Leonov et al. , 1990). Postischemic hypothermia provides long-term benefits if cooling is ini- tiated soon after injury and continued for 24 hrs (Dietrich et al. , 1993; Colbourne et al. , 1997). Although an early study of mild hypothermia found no protection (Morikawa et al. , 1992) others have shown that more profound temperature reductions (24 ̊ C) after permanent focal ischemia did provide protection (Onesti et al. , 1991). In addition, extended periods of mild hypothermia have also been reported to reduce infarct volume (Zhang et al. , 1993c). Thus, it appears that in conditions of permanent focal ischemia, profound degrees of hypothermia and/or extended hypothermic durations may be necessary to significantly protect the injured brain. In contrast to permanent occlusion, significant improvements in outcome have been shown in various models of transient MCA occlusion (Huh et al. , 2000; Kawai et al. , 2000). Selective brain hypothermia during the 2-hour period of transient occlusion significantly reduced infarct volume (Chen et al. , 1992). A brain tem- perature reduction of 3 ̊ C and 8 ̊ C, respectively, has been reported to provide dramatic and complete neuro- protection after 80 minutes of transient MCA occlusion (Barone et al. , 1997). One of the limitations of postis- chemic hypothermia appears to be the therapeutic win- dow. Although dramatic protection is observed if hypothermia is induced during or immediately after the ischemic insult, fewer degrees of protection are observed as a delay in the initiation of hypothermia is demon- strated. Based on current experimental data, a 2 to 3 hour hypothermic window has been consistenly reported in the literature (Coimbra and Wieloch, 1994), indicat- ing that cooling needs to be initiated soon after the pri- mary insult. Brain temperature has also been shown to play an important role in TBI. Clifton first reported that imme- diate posttraumatic hypothermia for 1 hour improved 254 Neuroprotection Ch14.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 254"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"behavioral outcome after F-P injury (1991). Subsequent histopathological studies showed that moderate hypothermia (30 ̊ C/3 hr) reduced the frequency of corti- cal neuronal damage and contusion volume (Dietrich et al. , 1994a). Mild-to-moderate hypothermia provides neuroprotection of white matter structures after anoxic or traumatic injury (Stys et al. , 1992b; Marion and White, 1996; Koizumi and Povlishock, 1998). Finally, cognitive function is improved in posttraumatic animals after hypothermic therapy (Bramlett et al. , 1995). Various pathophysiological mechanisms, including excitotoxicity, free radical production, metabolic stress, and inflamma- tion, have been reported to be reduced by therapeutic hypothermic interventions (Dietrich et al. , 1996). A number of single institute studies have reported a benefit of hypothermic therapy in head-injured patients (Marion et al. , 1997; Jiang et al. , 2000; Polderman et al. , 2002). In these studies, hypothermia has commonly been shown to reduce intracranial pressure (ICP) and improve the rate of favorable outcome without increasing compli- cation rates. However, a recent multicenter trial failed to demonstrate an overall improvement with hypothermia (Clifton et al. , 2001), although post hoc analysis showed a benefit to patients who were less than 45 years old and were hypothermic on admission (Clifton et al. , 2002). Thus more investigations are required to determine the limitations of hypothermic therapy and the identification of specific patient populations that can best benefit from this treatment. Several clinical studies have been initiated to test the beneficial effects of therapeutic hypothermia in various patient populations (Marion and White, 1996; Schwab et al. , 1998; Kammersgaard et al. , 2000; Clifton et al. , 2001). The results of two multicenter trials were published that reported benefits of therapeutic hypothermia (Hypothermia after Cardiac Arrest Study Group, 2002; Bernard et al. , 2002). In the European study nine centers in five countries participated, with a total enrollment of 275 patients. Systemic hypothermia for 24 hours combined with passive rewarming resulted in a favorable neurologi- cal outcome in 55% of hypothermic patients compared to 39% of normothermic patients. That two independent studies resulted in basically the same positive findings and conclusions is extremely positive for the field of therapeu- tic hypothermia. Some have argued that these results may place hypothermia as part of expected standard of care. Recently, feasibility studies have been initiated to determine whether systemic hypothermia can be pro- duced in stroke patients (Schwab et al. , 1998, 2001). Schwab and colleagues (1998) induced moderate hypothermia in 25 patients with severe ischemic stroke of the MCA territory. Patients were kept at 33 ̊ C for 48 to 72 hours by surface cooling. In that pilot study hypother- mia was shown to reduce ICP; however, during the rewarming period, brain hemorrhage and secondary ICP were documented. Investigators are currently studying the rewarming phase to determine how to control ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure during the critical posthypothermic period (Steiner et al. , 2001). Also, rele- vant to the preclinical data, studies have shown reduced levels of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid of stroke patients who were cooled compared to normothermic subjects (Berger et al. , 2002). An important area of investigation is the develop- ment of better methods of patient cooling. In the past, bags of ice and body blankets have been used to produce a surface cooling with some success. As the necessity for more critical control of a patient’s temperature becomes apparent, other strategies must be developed to accom- plish this goal. To this end, new strategies for surface cooling, as well as endovascular cooling catheters, are being developed and tested (Georgiadis et al. , 2001). These cooling devices are demonstrating that periods of hyperthermia (fever) in patients after CNS injury can be reduced in frequency as well as being used to produce systemic hypothermia. The continued development of this important field will improve the way we administer hypothermia and provide better protection and treat- ment for patients with neurological disorders. ENDOGENOUS REPARATIVE PROCESSES One of the most exciting discoveries in recent years in the area of neuroscience has been the observation that neurogenesis continues in the adult CNS after injury (McKay, 1997; Doetsch et al. , 1999; Gage, 2000; Alvarez- Buylla and Garcia-Verdugo, 2002; Garcia-Verdugo et al. , 2002). Using a variety of labeling techniques and methods of tracing neurogenesis after CNS injection, several labo- ratories have reported neurogenesis in areas such as the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus of the hippocam- pus (Liu et al. , 1998; Zhang et al. , 2001; Dash et al. , 2001; Parent et al. , 2002). For example, after cerebral ischemia, seizures, and TBI, there is a massive proliferation of stem and progenitor cells (Mak et al. , 2003; Chen et al. , 2003). The identification of the fate of these cells is an area of intensive investigation. In a model of F-P brain injury, the total number of proliferating cells identified with 5-bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of metabolic activity, was shown to significantly increase in the area of subventricular zone and hippocampus (Chirumamilla et al. , 2002; Chen et al. , 2003). After transient cerebral ischemia, increased numbers of BrdU-labeled neurons were detected in the dentate gyrus (Liu et al. , 1998). Targeting this endogenous proliferative response to injury, including the use of neuroprotective agents, may be one way to enhance recovery after brain injury. Neuroprotection 255 Ch14.qxd 9/1/04 6:41 AM Page 255"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"WHERE ARE WE GOING? Despite the lack of clinically successful neuroprotec- tive strategies, there has never been more excitement in the field of drug development targeting death of gray and white matter. Indeed, the clarification of various injury mechanisms has now emphasized the shortcom- ings of previous clinical trials that it is hoped will improve future studies. Also, preclinical modeling has been significantly improved, whereby therapeutic win- dows, long-term protection, and functional outcome measures are now incorporated into neuroprotective studies. Pharmacokinetics and methods of drug delivery are now emphasized in both preclinical and clinical investigations. The importance of temperature variations on injury mechanisms has led to the first successful neuroprotec- tive strategy in patients following cardiac arrest. Future progress will involve the development of safe and effi- cient methods of inducing hypothermia so that multicen- ter trials can be more rigorously evaluated. These methods will enhance the ability to cool patients rapidly, critically maintain temperatures within predetermined ranges, and control rates of posthypothermia rewarming. Prevention of periods of CNS hyperthermia with these cooling devices should also reduce the incidence of sec- ondary insults, possibly allowing pharmacological strate- gies to provide better protection. Indeed, the use of mild hypothermia in combination with drug therapy may lead to synergistic effects and better outcomes. Endogenous ischemic tolerance or ischemic precondi- tioning is a phenomenon whereby an ischemic or hypoxic insult is so brief that it causes no pathological damage and results in neuroprotective molecular and cellular changes. This phenomenon is interesting for two reasons. First, by understanding the mechanism of endogenous neuroprotection, perhaps new therapeutic strategies can be developed to exploit these systems. Second, some investigators have suggested that brief, nonlethal episodes of hypoxia or ischemia may be induced in patients who are likely to experience an ischemic event, such as those undergoing high-risk surgical procedures. Although induction of hypoxia/ischemia in patients is probably premature at this point, research is ongoing into how this phenomenon can be exploited. Ischemic preconditioning works through antiexcitotoxic, anti- apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, and clin- ical trials are being planned to test pharmacological ischemic preconditions in high-risk patients (Dirnagl et al. , 2003). Future directions in neuroprotection may also make use of multiple drugs targeting specific therapeutic win- dows and pathomechanisms. This “combination therapy” approach may find its way into clinical trials, although current support for such therapies by drug companies is limited. The ability of drugs to target multiple pathome- chanisms should maximize the chances of CNS protec- tion in the postinjury setting. It has become increasingly apparent that therapeutic interventions must be, to some degree, customized for each patient. Every patient with CNS injury is unique with respect to the size and location of structural lesions, presence or absence of secondary injury mechanisms, and genetic or environmental factors that differ among patient populations. Basing treatment decisions on indi- cators of specific tissue injury mechanisms is an attrac- tive and possibly beneficial practice. Development and use of biomarkers and imaging strategies that indicate injury cascade activity or the progression of secondary injury mechanisms will help make this possible. In the future, genetic factors that may predispose or protect a patient to a certain type of injury may help guide therapeutic interventions. Genetic screening may be developed for use in new treatment protocols. The continued study of endogenous neuroprotection mecha- nisms such as hypoxic/ischemic preconditioning should reveal new therapeutic strategies. Because of the restricted windows of opportunity for most therapeutic interventions, treatments need to be ini- tiated at the earliest postinjury period. Thus the adminis- tration of drugs at the accident site or by emergency room staff should increase efficacy. This point is particu- larly important because an important reason why clinical trials fail is that the drug or therapy was not initiated soon enough to stop the injury cascade. Finally, neuroprotection treatments should not be lim- ited to the postinjury setting alone. Patients at risk during elective surgical procedures may benefit from pretreat- ment strategies. Drug therapies or mild hypothermia could be used during complications from invasive brain or spinal cord procedures. Also, as the field of transplanta- tion strategies advances, it may be advantageous to use neuroprotective strategies in combination with transplan- tation and regeneration strategies. Many of these approaches will be invasive, and the use of a neuroprotec- tive strategy may limit the damage produced by the proce- dure. Continued discussions between researchers in both the experimental and clinical arenas should continue to help advance the development and testing of novel thera- peutic strategies in patients with a variety of CNS injuries.

Substantial progress has been made over the last 20 years in understanding the basic biology and function of the normal nervous system, and in elucidating molec- ular and cellular mechanisms that underlie neurological disease. Together with these advances in understanding have come discoveries of novel genes and proteins, which collectively present an unprecedented opportunity to intervene in and treat a number of neurological disorders that heretofore have been untreatable. These opportunities for treatment are matched by new practical challenges: How can we deliver novel therapeu- tics to the nervous system? For example, nervous system growth factors offer the potential to prevent cell death and stimulate cell function, but they are large protein molecules that do not penetrate the central nervous sys- tem (CNS). Further, growth factors cause adverse effects from stimulation of nontargeted systems if delivered into the CNS widely and without region-specific targeting. Gene delivery offers the potential to provide growth fac- tors to specific regions of the CNS that contain degener- ating neurons, thereby bypassing diffusion limitations of the blood-brain barrier while restricting delivery of growth factors to their intended targets. In a second example, effective treatment of developmental abnormal- ities of the nervous system caused by single gene muta- tions, such as the inherited mucopolysaccharidoses, would require insertion of a correct copy of a gene into many cells of the nervous system at a developmental or early postnatal time point. This, too, can theoretically be achieved by gene therapy by introducing gene delivery “vectors” into multiple and broad sites of the CNS, thereby replacing defective gene copies with copies of natural, working genes. Thus, the potential of gene therapy lies in practically targeting therapeutic substances to precise or broad CNS regions at effective concentrations for sustained time periods. This offers the possibility, depending on the nature of a given disease, to prevent cell death, augment cell function, or replace a developmentally defective gene. The field of gene therapy and its relevance to the treatment of neurological disease have come a long way in the past 20 years, and are likely to become a mainstay of neurological therapy in the next 20 years as we enter the era of “molecular medicine.” This chapter describes the development of gene therapy for neurological disease and presents examples of its implementation to treat neurological disease together with some of the challenges that remain to be addressed. DEVELOPMENT OF GENE THERAPY IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM The beginnings of gene therapy for diseases of the nervous system can be traced to any one of several poten- tial time points: identification by early biologists of the critical importance of the nucleus of the cell to the sur- vival and function of each cell; identification of the dou- ble helical structure of DNA in 1962; initial production and then routine use of “recombinant” DNA in the 1970s; first use of gene therapy to treat an animal model of neu- rological disease in 1988 (Rosenberg et al. , 1988); or the first human trial of gene therapy in 1990 (Culver et al. , 267 CHAPTER 15 Prospects for Gene Therapy for Central Nervous System Disease Mark H. Tuszynski, MD, PhD Ch15.qxd 9/1/04 6:42 AM Page 267"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"1991) (see also Osterman et al. , 1971; Friedmann and Roblin, 1972; Anderson and Fletcher, 1980). As noted previously, the real potential of gene therapy for nervous system disease lies in the ability to correct disorders result- ing from genetic mutations at even early time points of development, or to deliver therapeutic genes to the ner- vous system that can in some way compensate, ameliorate or prevent cell loss or dysfunction resulting from disease. A third and more recently emerging use of gene therapy is to block the expression of deleterious genes that cause dis- ease, such as Huntingtin or the amyloid precursor protein. Thus, in inborn errors of metabolism, the goal of gene therapy is to replace a mutated or deleted gene. In disor- ders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s dis- ease, or spinal cord injury, gene therapy can be used as a tool to deliver therapeutic substances such as growth fac- tors to the nervous system to prevent cell death and stim- ulate cell function. Lastly, in diseases such as Huntington’s disease or AD, expression of deleterious disease-causing genes could be blocked (by expressing small-interfering RNAs or antisense mRNAs via gene therapy). To implement gene therapy, a gene of interest must be identified, sequenced, and, ideally, have a well-defined function. The replacement gene is then introduced into the nervous system and expressed for a sufficient time period (possibly indefinitely) to treat the disease. Putting Genes into Cells: Ex Vivo vs In Vivo Gene Therapy Gene therapy can be divided into two basic approaches: ex vivo and in vivo gene delivery (Figure 15.1). In ex vivo gene delivery, host cells are obtained from a biopsy and established as in vitro (or ex vivo ) cultures, and are geneti- cally modified using one of several potential methods described later. Production of the desired gene product by the modified cells can be quantified. Cells are then grafted into the nervous system where they act as localized bio- logical pumps to deliver the gene product. Autologous cells that can act as vehicles of ex vivo gene delivery include fibroblasts (obtained from skin biopsies), bone marrow stromal cells, stem cells (e.g., from the bone mar- row), clonal lymphocytes, or Schwann cells. Outside the nervous system, tumor cells have also frequently been tar- gets of ex vivo genetic modification by enhancing their production of immune signaling molecules such as cytokines; once reintroduced into the body, the cells may more vigorously stimulate a response of the immune sys- tem to tumor antigens. In vivo gene therapy, on the other hand, circumvents all ex vivo cell preparation by instead injecting genes, usu- ally carried within viral vectors, directly into host cells in vivo . This results in the direct genetic modification of cells of the nervous system (Figure 15.1). Use of ex vivo vs in vivo Gene Therapy In the early days of testing the potential of gene ther- apy for animal models of nervous system disease, ex vivo gene therapy vectors generally resulted in better levels of gene product delivery in the nervous system than in vivo methods. More recently, however, in vivo methods of gene delivery have advanced substantially and now appear to exceed the efficiency of ex vivo gene delivery. For this reason, in vivo gene delivery methods are likely to become the mainstay of gene therapy for the nervous system, except in cases where cells must also be intro- duced to treat disease. Examples of the latter could include spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis, where not only a therapeutic gene would be beneficial (e.g., a growth factor to stimulate axon growth or myelin syn- thesis), but a replacement cell is also needed to provide a physical bridge in a lesion cavity (spinal cord injury) or to replace myelinating cells (e.g., a Schwann cell or neural stem cell, in multiple sclerosis). With few excep- tions, however, most gene therapy applications will now use in vivo gene delivery. Techniques of Gene Delivery into Cells New genes can be introduced into cells using several methods. The process begins by constructing a “plasmid” that is composed of nucleic acids coding for the gene of interest. This gene of interest is expressed by a promoter 268 Prospects for Gene Therapy for Central Nervous System Disease FIGURE 15.1 Schematic illustration of in vivo vs ex vivo gene therapy. In vivo gene therapy simply injects a therapeutic vector in the central nervous system (CNS) directly to modify native cells of the host brain. Ex vivo gene therapy obtains host cells from a biopsy, genetically mod- ifies them in vitro , and then implants the host’s own cells into the CNS to act as localized delivery agents for the therapeutic gene of interest. Ch15.qxd 9/1/04 6:42 AM Page 268"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Most recently, other RNA-based retroviral vectors have been used in gene therapy applications that do not require host cell division for viral entry into the cell. These include HIV-based vectors, feline immunodefi- ciency virus-based vectors, and lentiviral vectors (Naldini et al. , 1996a). These viruses presumably bind to cell sur- face receptors to gain entry into cells. Because these vec- tors are capable of entering nondividing cells, they can be used for direct gene delivery into nondividing cells of the adult brain. As described previously for MLV-based gene delivery systems, these vectors are rendered safe by removing wild-type genes responsible for viral replication and particle production. The very few remaining wild- type genes in some of the vectors express no secreted pro- teins, and hence are not known to elicit an immune response from the host. When used for in vivo gene deliv- ery to the nervous system, these vectors predominantly enter neurons (greater than 90% of modified cells in the brain are neuronal) and continue to express their gene product for at least one year in the primate brain, the longest time point examined to date. Like MLV vectors, HIV-based vectors integrate into the host genome. A number of DNA-based viruses have also been adapted for use in gene therapy (Miller, 1990; Muzyczka, 1992; Glorioso et al ., 1995; Naldini et al. , 1996b, Rabinowitz and Samulski, 1998). One of the earliest viruses to be studied for therapeutic gene delivery was the common cold virus, adenovirus. Binding to cell surface- based receptors, this virus enters nondividing cells and can therefore be used in in vivo gene therapy paradigms inside and outside the nervous system. Indeed, this vec- tor has been the most broadly tested of all in vivo gene therapy vectors in human clinical trials. However, the most commonly used version of the adenoviral vector expresses a number of wild-type viral proteins and, not surprisingly, has been plagued by resulting inflammatory and immune problems. These problems occur because of the existence of circulating neutralizing antibodies to adenoviral epitopes and as a result of the continued expression of wild-type adenoviral proteins from the vec- tor after entry into host cells. Indeed, an immune response to adenovirus led to a patient death in a sys- temic (non-nervous system) gene therapy trial in 1999, representing a setback to the field of gene therapy. However, the availability of later-generation AAV and lentivirus vectors substantially reduced this risk of immune response because the vectors do not express wild-type viral genes, and, in the case of lentivirus, humans do not have preexisting circulating antibodies to the virus. The safety profile of the AAV and lentiviral vectors for use in the nervous system is further reinforced because the absolute quantity of vector delivered for nervous system applications will in general be far lower than quantities used for systemic (non-nervous system) gene therapy. When adenovirus vectors are used for gene delivery in the nervous system, they do elicit immune responses (Cartmell et al. , 1999). More recently, newer generation “gutless” adenovirus vectors have been devel- oped that do not express wild-type viral genes, which may improve the safety profile of adenovirus-based vec- tors substantially. For the present, however, AAV- and HIV-based vectors appear to offer safety from the stand- point of an absence of significant host immune response to the vector and duration of in vivo gene expression. As mentioned previously, lentiviral vectors continue to express their therapeutic gene for at least 1 year after delivery to the primate brain, the longest time point examined to date (unpublished data). AAV vectors also appear to express their gene products for extended time periods in vivo , with persistent expression for at least 4.5 years in vivo (K. Bankiewicz, personal communication). A potential drawback of some in vivo gene therapy vectors, however, is the following: Depending on the spe- cific site of viral integration into a host genome, host gene expression may become disrupted. Hypothetically, if viral integration occurs in a host genomic sequence that codes for a tumor suppression gene, then tumor genes could become de-repressed, leading to malignant transformation. Alternatively, integration of viral pro- moters into the host genome could hypothetically acti- vate the expression of certain host genes, which, if adjacent to coding sequences for oncogenes, could also lead to tumorigenesis. This is a greater hypothetical prob- lem with in vivo gene delivery vectors that integrate into the host genome, such as retroviruses. AAV, which pri- marily remains intranuclear but extrachromosomal, is less likely to cause insertional mutagenesis in a host. Indeed, in a retroviral gene therapy trial for severe com- bined immunodeficiency in France, most patients showed a clear benefit from gene therapy to replace their defec- tive immune system gene (McCormack and Rabbitts, 2004); however, 3 of 11 children in the trial subsequently developed a form of leukemia resulting from insertional mutagenesis. Work is underway to modify the retrovirus and alter its sites of integration into the host genome. Other retroviral vectors, such as HIV-based and lentiviral vectors may not have the same integration site and may therefore have less risk. And again, other efficient in vivo gene therapy vectors such as AAV show little integration into the host genome, and several clinical trials in humans using AAV to date have not reported subsequent development of cancers. Comparison of in vivo and ex vivo Gene Therapy For use in treating neurological disorders, ex vivo and in vivo gene therapy approaches each have distinct 270 Prospects for Gene Therapy for Central Nervous System Disease Ch15.qxd 9/1/04 6:42 AM Page 270"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"advantages and disadvantages, depending on the poten- tial disease application (Table 15.1). Advantages of in vivo gene delivery include: 1. Simplicity. Gene delivery can be accomplished in a sin- gle step of direct vector injection into the desired brain target region, in contrast to the considerable cell pro- cessing that is required when using ex vivo gene delivery. 2. Minimal invasiveness. In vivo gene delivery is achieved by injection of several microliters of vector particles in a fluid solution to the brain and could be performed repeatedly if necessary; ex vivo gene therapy delivers cell suspensions that occupy some space in the brain and would be more difficult to repeat. Potential disadvantages of in vivo gene therapy relative to ex vivo gene therapy include the following: 1. Nonspecificity of target cell infection. Neurons, glia, and vascular cells can become genetically modified when in vivo vectors are injected into the brain. Whether there might be deleterious effects of express- ing certain genes in glia and vascular cells, such as growth factor or neurotransmitter genes, is unknown (although empirically, adverse effects have not been noted in prolonged primate expression studies to date). Ex vivo gene therapy allows specific selection of the cell type that expresses the gene(s) of interest before delivery to the brain. 2. Toxicity. As noted previously, some in vivo gene ther- apy vectors can be directly toxic to host cells, includ- ing herpes virus and rabies virus. Early adenovirus vectors elicited immune responses. HIV-based and AAV vector systems are generally safe and nontoxic and more recently have emerged as potential lead can- didates for gene delivery in the nervous system. Newer generation herpes “amplicon” vectors (expressing no wild-type viral genes) and herpes virus/AAV hybrid “amplicon” vectors under development also offer potentially safe gene delivery to the nervous system (Maguir-Zeis et al. , 2001; Heister et al. , 2002; Wang et al. , 2002). “Gutless” adenoviruses that do not express wild-type viral genes could also allow the reemergence of adenovirus-based systems for nervous system application (Yant et al. , 2002). 3. Risk of malignant transformation. As mentioned pre- viously, integrating vectors could cause cancer by interrupting a tumor suppressor gene or mutating an oncogene. This risk also exists for ex vivo gene delivery that uses vectors that integrate into the host genome. This risk is far less in nonintegrating in vivo vectors such as AAV. 4. Spontaneous recombination with wild-type viruses. It is hypothetically possible that an in vivo gene therapy vector could recombine with a wild-type virus, result- ing in replication-competent vectors or other mutated viruses with potential for virulence. This risk can be minimized to a range approaching near impossibility by removing most wild-type coding sequences in the therapeutic vector, by screening recipients of gene therapy for existing infection with wild-type virus such as HIV, and by the creation of hybrid vectors with lit- tle if any overlap in wild-type coding sequences. Advantages of ex vivo gene delivery relative to in vivo gene delivery include the following: 1. Targeting. Ex vivo gene therapy can target selected cell types in vitro for subsequent grafting to the brain. 2. Safety. Ex vivo gene delivery does not introduce infec- tious viral particles into the brain; hence there is little risk of recombination with wild-type viruses. Ex vivo gene delivery uses cells from the host; thus there is no risk of immune rejection. Empirically, in a clinical trial of ex vivo nerve growth factor (NGF) gene deliv- ery for AD, there have been no complications to date of the ex vivo gene delivery system. Disadvantages of ex vivo gene therapy relative to in vivo gene therapy include the following: 1. Requirement for target cells to divide. As noted previ- ously, for host cells to be maintained and genetically modified in vitro , they must be capable of dividing. Thus, most postmitotic cell populations such as neu- rons cannot act as vehicles of ex vivo gene therapy in the nervous system. 2. Tumor formation. It is possible that the dividing cells delivered to the brain could form tumors. However, this has not been observed when implanting primary (nonimmortalized) cells into the brain, although Prospects for Gene Therapy for Central Nervous System Disease 271 TABLE 15.1 Comparison of in vivo and ex vivo Gene Therapy in vivo Gene Therapy ex vivo Gene Therapy Advantages Simple, effective Targets specific cell types minimally invasive Safe (little risk of wild-type viral recombination) Disadvantages Modifies neurons, Cumbersome glia, vessels Risk of cancer Risk of cancer induction induction (retroviruses) Potential wild-type recombination Absence of regulation Absence of regulation Ch15.qxd 9/1/04 6:42 AM Page 271"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"grafts of immortalized cell lines have formed tumors. “Conditionally immortalized” cell lines that shut off immortalizing genes at 37 ̊C have been successfully implanted into the body without forming tumors (McKay, 1992; Whittemore et al. , 1997). To date, tumor formation has not been observed in a human clinical trial of NGF gene delivery for AD. Insertional mutagenesis is also a risk when using viral vectors that integrate into the host genome in ex vivo gene therapy, as described previously under “disadvantages of in vivo gene delivery.” 3. Complexity. The ex vivo gene therapy process of cell culture, gene modification, and preparation for implantation is cumbersome and time consuming, requiring 2 to 3 months. In vivo gene delivery can be performed immediately. In vivo and ex vivo gene therapy both suffer from the drawback that they must be introduced into the brain by direct injection to be effectively administered to the CNS. The blood-brain barrier blocks passage of most vectors into the brain. Even if peripheral delivery routes for the CNS were available, they likely could not be used because most nervous system applications of gene delivery would require highly specific and restricted delivery of genes such as growth factors to specific regions of the brain. Production of the gene of interest in nontargeted regions of the brain could be deleterious. On the other hand, direct gene delivery into the CNS can be accomplished relatively simply and safely through a small burr hole. Finally, whereas many gene therapy vectors now effi- ciently express their gene products for prolonged time periods (years in the case of AAV and lentivirus), the ability to turn “off ” gene expression has not been per- fected. Future development of a practical and effective gene delivery system that can be regulated is discussed later in more detail. Growth Factor Gene Therapy for Neurological Disease: Alzheimer’s Disease Neurodegenerative diseases are attractive candidates for gene therapy. Several of these disorders, including AD, Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral scle- rosis (ALS), lack truly effective therapies. Other disor- ders, such as Parkinson’s disease, have effective symptomatic therapies but no means to prevent disease progression. The discovery of a class of neuroprotective substances called nervous system growth factors offers the potential for the first time to reduce cell loss in neu- rological disease and to stimulate the function of remain- ing neurons. However, growth factors are large and polar molecules, and they do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Further, they exhibit toxicity if delivered to nonaffected brain regions. Thus, effective harnessing of the potential of growth factors to treat neurological disease requires site-specific, intracranial delivery. Gene therapy has emerged as a leading method for achieving long-term, highly localized, and regionally restricted delivery of growth factors to the brain. Clinical trials of growth fac- tor gene delivery are underway in the most common age- related neurodegnerative disorder, AD (Tuszynski, 2002), and will soon include Parkinson’s disease, and possibly ALS and Huntington’s disease. Growth Factors Several different families of growth factors exist, each of which affects the survival and function of various neu- rons throughout the nervous system. The first nervous system growth factor was identified more than 50 years ago by Rita Levi-Montalcini and Viktor Hamburger, and was aptly named nerve growth factor . Levi-Montalcini and Hamburger discovered that mouse sarcoma extracts contained a substance that promoted sensory and sym- pathetic neuron survival in the embryonic chick (Levi- Montalcini and Hamburger, 1951; Levi-Montalcini, 1987). Over subsequent decades, several important fea- tures surrounding the role of NGF during development were defined. Its structure was elucidated in the early 1970s (Angeletti et al. , 1973), and the gene was cloned in 1983 (Ullrich et al. , 1983). However, the startling discov- ery that NGF could also influence neuronal survival in the adult nervous system came nearly 40 years after its initial discovery. In 1986 and 1987, three research groups independently reported that injections of NGF protein into the adult brain prevented the death of forebrain cholinergic neu- rons (Hefti, 1986; Williams et al. , 1986; Kromer, 1987). In 1987, it was also reported that NGF reversed sponta- neous age-related morphological and behavioral decline in rats (Fischer et al. , 1987). These findings ushered in an era of intense interest in both basic mechanisms of growth factor action in the nervous system and an explo- ration of their therapeutic potential to prevent cell death in neurological disease. The ability of NGF to prevent the death of cholinergic neurons was extended to primate systems, where it promoted the survival of 80% to 100% of cholinergic neurons after lesions (Koliatsos et al. , 1990; Tuszynski et al. , 1990, 1991). NGF for Alzheimer’s Disease The potential relevance of NGF actions to neuronal loss in AD was evident immediately (Hefti and Weiner, 1986; Phelps et al. , 1989). Cholinergic neurons of the 272 Prospects for Gene Therapy for Central Nervous System Disease Ch15.qxd 9/1/04 6:42 AM Page 272"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"basal forebrain undergo profound atrophy and death during the course of AD (Perry et al. , 1977; Whitehouse et al. , 1981), contributing to cognitive decline (Perry et al. , 1978; Bartus et al. , 1982; Whitehouse et al. , 1982; Candy et al. , 1983). NGF is normally produced through- out life in the brain and is believed to support the integrity of cholinergic systems (Sofroniew et al. , 1990). Notably, NGF transport and availability to support the function and survival of cholinergic neurons are defective in AD (Mufson et al. , 1995; Scott et al. , 1995). Thus, NGF could reduce or prevent the cholinergic component of cell loss in AD. Delivery of NGF protein to the brain is difficult, however, because NGF is a medium-sized, charged pro- tein that does not cross the blood-brain barrier. To reach the brain effectively in animal studies, NGF was pumped into the lateral ventricles where it diffused short distances to reach cholinergic cell bodies (Hefti, 1986; Williams et al. , 1986; Kromer, 1987; Emmett et al. , 1996). Intracerebroventricular infusion of NGF was the only available delivery route for a clinical trial in AD, and plans were formulated accordingly (Phelps et al. , 1989). However, preclinical distribution and toxicology studies of intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusions revealed several adverse effects of this route of NGF administration. All of these effects reflected the potency of NGF in stimulating the function of neurons of the adult brain, and all adverse effects were attributable to the broad, nontargeted distribution of NGF that resulted from intraventricular infusions. For example, Isaacson and Crutcher reported that NGF-sensitive sympathetic axons sprouted around the cerebral vascu- lature after ICV infusion (Isaacson et al. , 1990). Williams reported that ICV infusions of NGF caused weight loss in rats owing to a reduction in food intake (Williams, 1991). Perhaps most worrisome, Winkler and colleagues (Winkler et al. , 1997) as well as Emmett and colleagues (Emmett et al. , 1996) reported that Schwann cells, which bear receptors for NGF, migrated into an expanding cell layer in the subpial space surrounding the brainstem and spinal cord after ICV NGF infusions. This Schwann cell response reversed after discontinua- tion of NGF infusion. NGF infusions also led to sen- sory axon sprouting and a pain syndrome. These adverse effects all occurred in neuronal systems with known patterns of sensitivity to NGF, and all reflected stimulation of the relevant neuronal systems by NGF. Thus it was evident that central intraventricular infu- sions of NGF protein were an impractical delivery method for a clinical trial in AD. Indeed, three AD patients in Sweden received ICV infusions of NGF, and not surprisingly the trial was discontinued because of the development of weight loss and pain (Eriksdotter Jonhagen et al. , 1998). NGF Gene Delivery An alternative method was required that could deliver NGF across the blood-brain barrier, yet restrict its deliv- ery to cholinergic cell targets to avoid adverse events. Gene therapy was already emerging as a potential means of achieving sustained and localized protein delivery to the brain. In 1988, the first successful use of ex vivo gene delivery to the brain was reported, using NGF gene delivery to rescue cholinergic neurons after injury (Rosenberg et al. , 1988). These early studies of gene ther- apy in the nervous system used ex vivo rather than in vivo gene delivery paradigms because the vectors for ex vivo gene delivery were superior at the time, both in terms of long-term gene expression in the brain and in safety (absence of immune responses). In the first study of gene delivery to the brain, rat fibroblasts were obtained from skin biopsies and genetically modified to produce and secrete human NGF using retroviral vectors. These cells were implanted into the septal nucleus of rats that had undergone fimbria-fornix lesions. Typically, fimbria- fornix lesions result in the degeneration and death of cholinergic neurons by depriving these cells of contact with their hippocampal targets. Rats that received ex vivo grafts of NGF-secreting fibroblasts exhibited highly sig- nificant rescue of cholinergic neurons compared to con- trol subjects that received implants of cells expressing a control reporter gene, β -galactosidase. Subsequently, Chen and Gage (1995) reported that ex vivo gene delivery of NGF also reversed cholinergic neuronal atrophy and improved cognition in aged rats. We then examined whether ex vivo NGF gene delivery could also prevent cholinergic neuronal degeneration in the brains of adult primates. Rhesus monkeys underwent fornix lesions followed by implants of primary autolo- gous fibroblasts that were genetically modified to pro- duce and secrete human NGF. Genetically modified cells were placed adjacent to degenerating cholinergic neu- ronal cell bodies in the basal forebrain. One month later, animals that received NGF-secreting cell implants exhib- ited a significant reduction in cholinergic degeneration compared to control monkeys that received implants of primary fibroblasts that did not secrete growth factors (Figure 15.3) (Tuszynski et al. , 1996). A total of 68% of neurons were rescued in monkeys that underwent ex vivo NGF gene delivery, whereas control monkeys showed survival of only 25% of cholinergic neurons ( P < .05). Further, as we became more experienced in accurately placing ex vivo NGF-secreting cells adjacent to degener- ating cholinergic neurons, the extent of neuronal protec- tion increased to 92%. This neuronal protection was achieved using NGF doses roughly 500-fold lower than quantities of NGF protein used in previous ICV infusion studies (Koliatsos et al. , 1990; Tuszynski et al. , 1990).

This limited diffusion substantially improved the poten- tial safety profile of NGF, reducing the risk that adverse effects would result from protein spread beyond the tar- geted region. Emerich, Kordower, and colleagues also reported cholinergic neuronal rescue in monkeys after fornix lesions, using an alternative form of gene therapy in which encapsulated xenogenic cells were implanted into the brains of either y oung or aged monkeys (Emerich et al. , 1994; Kordower et al. , 1994). At this point, it was clear that ex vivo NGF gene deliv- ery could prevent lesion-induced degeneration of cholin- ergic neurons in the primate brain. Cholinergic neurons die in AD, although the precise mechanism whereby cholinergic neurons (or any neuron, for that matter) die in AD is unknown. Thus, we thought that it was impor- tant to demonstrate that cholinergic neurons degenerat- ing as a result of another mechanism of neural damage could also respond to ex vivo NGF gene delivery. Aging is another form of damage to the nervous system, result- ing in spontaneous atrophy of cholinergic neurons in rats. Thus we examined the brains of aged rhesus mon- keys for sensitivity to ex vivo NGF gene therapy. Examination of the brains of unoperated, aged monkeys revealed that 40% of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are atrophic (but not dead) compared to young monkeys (Smith et al. , 1999). Notably, 3 months after undergoing ex vivo NGF gene delivery, aged rhesus monkeys exhib- ited a restoration of functional cholinergic neuronal markers to levels equivalent to young monkeys (Smith et al. , 1999). Cell size was also restored to levels indistin- guishable from young monkeys. Control, aged monkeys that underwent ex vivo gene therapy containing a reporter gene, but not NGF, evidenced no neuroprotection. Further, aged monkeys undergoing ex vivo NGF gene delivery demonstrated a return to levels of young mon- keys of cholinergic axon projections to the cortex (Conner et al. , 2001). Dose-Escalation/Toxicity Studies of NGF ex vivo Gene Transfer in Primates The preceding studies showed that ex vivo NGF gene delivery could prevent cholinergic neuronal degeneration and ameliorate age-related cholinergic neuronal atrophy in the brains of primates, suggesting that various mecha- nisms of cholinergic damage in primates were indeed sensitive to ex vivo NGF gene delivery. Rodent studies indicated that two additional mechanisms of cholinergic degeneration were also sensitive to NGF delivery: excito- toxic injury (Dekker et al. , 1991) and amyloid-induced degeneration of cholinergic neurons in trisomy-16 mutant mice (Holtzman et al. , 1993). Further, NGF dif- 274 Prospects for Gene Therapy for Central Nervous System Disease FIGURE 15.3 NGF prevents the death of adult primate cholinergic neurons.

Thus the prospect that gene therapy could achieve localized and effective delivery of NGF to the brain was emerging. To further test this possibility before embarking on a clinical trial, a dose escalation/toxicity study of ex vivo NGF gene delivery was performed in adult monkeys. Subjects received escalating volumes of autologous NGF-producing cells (autologous fibroblasts) into the nucleus basalis. Volumes ranged from 5 μ l of cells per injection site to a maximum of 100 μ l of cells per injec- tion site. Extent and duration of gene expression were measured together with NGF levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, implanted graft size, weight, and general activity measures over a 1-year period. At the highest cell injection volumes, fibroblasts refluxed from injections sites, yet no resulting toxicity was observed. Weights of all grafted subjects remained stable, and there was no evidence of pain or discomfort. Implanted cells did not migrate and tumors did not form. NGF was not detectable by enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay in spinal fluid samples taken 6 months and 1 year after therapy, and Schwann cells did not migrate into the subpial space of the brain- stem or spinal cord. Gene expression was present for at least 1 year in the primate brain, assessed from brain biopsies taken at graft sites; NGF levels exceeded physi- ological levels fivefold after 1 year in vivo . Thus, ex vivo NGF gene delivery in the primate brain could prevent cholinergic neuronal degeneration, reverse spontaneous age-related cholinergic atrophy, and safely sustain gene expression for 1 year with no evidence of toxicity. A Phase I Clinical Trial of NGF Gene Therapy in Alzheimer’s Disease Based on the preceding safety and efficacy data, a rational basis was established for proceeding to a clinical trial to determine whether ex vivo NGF gene therapy could reduce cholinergic neuronal degeneration in AD. NGF could hypothetically benefit AD via two distinct mechanisms: by reducing cholinergic neuronal death, or by augmenting cholinergic neuronal function by stimulat- ing NGF-mediated release of acetylcholine in the cortex. Two important questions remained to be tested in the clinical trial: 1. Could cholinergic cell loss in AD be prevented by NGF delivery? The underlying cause of neuronal death in AD remains unknown. Whereas extensive neurofibrillary degeneration occurs in cholinergic neurons in AD, there is little deposition of amyloid in the cholinergic nucleus basalis. As noted previously, NGF levels in the cholinergic basal forebrain in AD are significantly reduced compared to age-matched control subjects (Mufson et al. , 1995; Scott et al. , 1995), although NGF production in the cortex is not reduced in the AD brain. Thus, defects in NGF retrograde transport appear to exist in AD and could result in cholinergic neuronal degeneration. Delivery of NGF to the cholinergic neuronal cell body using ex vivo gene therapy could bypass a transport defect and sus- tain the survival and function of cholinergic neurons. Even if a primary deficiency of NGF itself does not cause cholinergic neuronal loss in AD, NGF gene delivery could potentially benefit AD by augmenting cholinergic transmission. 2. Would amelioration of the cholinergic component of cell degeneration in AD be sufficient to impact cogni- tive decline? Multiple neuronal systems decline in AD in addition to cholinergic neurons. However, of the neuronal systems that decline in AD, loss of choliner- gic neurons correlates best with synapse loss (Terry et al. , 1991) and dementia severity (Perry et al. , 1978). Further, the cholinergic system plays a critical role in modulating cortical plasticity in the intact brain (Conner, 2003). Indeed, several clinical trials have shown a modest effect of cholinergic system augmen- tation by cholinesterase inhibitors, even though these oral agents only slightly augment central levels of acetylcholine (Davis et al. , 1992, Mayeux and Sano, 1999). Thus, preventing cholinergic degeneration in AD, especially early in the disease, could impact disease progression and quality of life. A Phase I safety trial of ex vivo NGF gene delivery in humans with early stage AD began at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in 2001. Early stage patients were selected for two reasons. First, patients must understand the nature and potential risks of the procedure they are undergoing, as this is the first human clinical trial of gene therapy in AD. Most patients with early AD are capable of such insight. The consent of the primary caregiver is also obtained. Second, the hypothet- ical benefit of NGF in preventing cholinergic degenera- tion will be of most benefit earliest in the disease, when the greatest population of cholinergic neurons remains to be rescued. Using the same methods described previously for our preclinical primate studies, primary autologous patient fibroblasts were genetically modified to produce and secrete human NGF in vitro . After verifying adequate pro- duction of human NGF, cells were placed into the human nucleus basalis of Meynert in a dose-escalation trial design. The lowest dose of cells delivered in this clinical Prospects for Gene Therapy for Central Nervous System Disease 275 Ch15.qxd 9/1/04 6:43 AM Page 275"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"trial was effective in rescuing cholinergic neurons in non- human primate studies, and the highest dose used in this trial was well below maximum tolerated cell volumes in monkeys. Eight subjects have undergone the gene deliv- ery procedure, and endpoints that will be examined in the trial include general safety measures as well as cognitive function and glucose metabolism on positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Potential risks of the study include those associated with inadvertent, widespread distribution of NGF pro- tein, including pain, weight loss, and Schwann cell migration into the subpial space. Other risks include hemorrhage from needle passage into the brain, tumor formation from the grafted cells, and migration of the grafted cells. These adverse effects were not encoun- tered in more than 200 NGF-secreting cell implants in preclinical primate studies, representing an extensive base of empirical safety data that mitigates the poten- tial risk of a clinical trial. Of potentially greatest con- cern in this clinical trial would be the development of adverse effects resulting from unintended widespread expression of NGF. Although pain could be treated with analgesics or weight loss controlled with behav- ioral measures, optimally a means would be available to turn expression of the therapeutic gene “off.” Such means are not currently available, and are under devel- opment (see later). Given the impressive efficacy of NGF in preventing loss of cholinergic systems, the extensive empirical safety data in five primate studies (Emerich et al. , 1994; Kordower et al. , 1994; Tuszynski et al. , 1994, 1996; Smith, 1999; Conner, 2001), the lack of other broadly effective therapies for AD, and the dis- ease’s relentlessly progressive course, the clinical trial has proceeded. In vivo Gene Therapy for Alzheimer’s Disease The current ex vivo trial of NGF gene therapy in AD will be followed by a trial of in vivo gene therapy for AD. As noted previously, the available vectors for ex vivo gene therapy were superior to the vectors for in vivo gene ther- apy until recently; hence our clinical program advanced on an ex vivo design. The emergence of AAV and lentivi- ral vectors for in vivo gene delivery to the nervous system will likely replace ex vivo trials in nervous system disease, unless in vivo vectors have unexpected toxicities that have not been revealed to date by primate studies, a possibility that seems unlikely. For applications to Alzheimer’s dis- ease, in vivo NGF gene delivery has been shown to pre- vent cholinergic neuronal death in rat models using AAV vectors (Mandel, 1999; Blesch, 2002) and, preliminarily, to reverse age-related cholinergic neuronal atrophy (Klein et al. , 2000). Studies are ongoing with both AAV and lentivirus systems in primates, providing a potential basis for human clinical trials. Other Genes for AD More than 50 nervous system growth factors have been identified to date (Tuszynski, 1999), raising the pos- sibility that growth factors might also be used to target other degenerating neuronal populations in AD. Two other growth factors are of particular interest in this regard: brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and basic fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). BDNF pre- vents the death of cortical neurons (Giehl and Tetzlaff, 1996; Lu et al. , 2001), and levels of BDNF are dimin- ished in the hippocampus in AD (Phillips et al. , 1991). FGF-2 prevents injury-induced degeneration of entorhi- nal cortical neurons (Gomez-Pinilla et al. , 1992; Peterson et al. , 1996). Whereas the entire cortex would not be a practical target for growth factor gene delivery in a dis- order such as AD, critical areas such as the entorhinal cortex or hippocampus might be candidates for growth factor gene delivery to prevent cell loss. This possibility is the subject of ongoing preclinical studies. In addition, cells that have been genetically modified to secrete the neurotransmitter acetylcholine have been shown to sig- nificantly ameliorate age-related cognitive decline in rats (Winkler et al. , 1995). A practical limitation in the appli- cation of a transmitter replacement approach for gene therapy of AD, however, is the large size of the human cortex that would need to be targeted. In contrast, the size of the basal forebrain cholinergic system that is the target of our ongoing trial of ex vivo NGF gene delivery in AD is only 1 cm in rostral-caudal extent. Gene Therapy for Parkinson’s Disease Growth Factor Gene Delivery for Parkinson’s Disease Three growth factors are potential therapeutic candi- dates for gene delivery in the second-most common neurodegenerative disorder, Parkinson’s disease (PD): glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurturin (NTN), and BDNF. Progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons occurs in the substantia nigra in PD, and several in vitro studies demonstrate that GDNF, NTN, and BDNF support the survival of developing nigral neu- rons. More important, in vivo studies in both rodent and primate models of PD show that these growth factors prevent nigral cell loss and promote functional recovery (Spina et al. , 1992; Frim et al. , 1993; Lin et al. , 1993; Hyman et al. , 1994; Gash et al. , 1996; Kotzbauer et al. , 1996; Winkler et al. , 1996; Connor et al. , 1999; Bjorklund et al. , 2000; Kordower et al. , 2000). 276 Prospects for Gene Therapy for Central Nervous System Disease Ch15.qxd 9/1/04 6:43 AM Page 276"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Based on these types of findings, a clinical trial of ICV GDNF protein infusion was performed in PD (Nutt, 2003). However, the nontargeted nature of ICV GDNF infusions induced adverse effects including nau- sea, weight loss, and Lhermitte signs. Not only did this broad, nontargeted delivery route cause toxicity, but GDNF failed to reach nigral neurons in significant con- centrations (J. Kordower, Rush-Presbyterian Medical Center, personal communication). Once again, this out- come reinforces the concept that the adequate clinical assessment of the potential of growth factors to treat human disease will require that effective concentrations of the agents be delivered to neural structures in ade- quate doses and in a manner that is highly targeted and regionally-restricted, to avoid adverse effects of these potent agents. Evidence from the preclinical literature suggested that the optimal site for delivery of growth factors to degen- erating nigrostriatal circuitry might in fact be the region of the caudate/putamen, where a growth factor could induce sprouting of host dopaminergic terminals into their natural striatal targets (Kirik, 2000). GDNF, NTN, or BDNF delivered to the striatum in this manner could promote the survival of nigral neurons because the growth factors are transported in a retrograde fashion from the striatum to neurons of the substantia nigra (Mufson et al. , 1996). Rodent studies using in vivo gene delivery of GDNF in fact showed significant neuropro- tection and functional recovery in rats with experimen- tally induced PD (Connor et al. , 1999; Bjorklund et al. , 2000). Subsequently, Kordower and colleagues showed in a primate model of PD, MPTP-induced parkinsonism, that in vivo lentiviral GDNF gene delivery induced nearly complete anatomical recovery and functional recovery (Kordower et al. , 2000). In addition, lentiviral gene deliv- ery to aged monkeys also reversed age-related biochemi- cal and anatomical degeneration of nigrostriatal circuitry (Kordower et al. , 2000). Hence, a clear rationale has been established for pursuing gene delivery in PD, with the potential to both prevent neuronal degeneration and augment the function of remaining circuitry. In the absence of vectors that can be clinically regulated and that would allow shut-off of the gene in vivo , however, additional primate studies should be done to demon- strate convincingly the safety of this approach. A Phase I trial of intraparenchymal infusion of GDNF protein into the striatum in PD has been reported, providing additional rationale and proof-of- principle for delivery of growth factors to treat PD (Gill et al. , 2003). Five patients received continuous infusions of GDNF into a single site in the putamen via an implanted Medtronics pump, and showed signs of both clinical improvement and increased regional fluorodopa uptake on PET scan. However, hardware problems occurred in two patients, and all subjects showed an increase in MRI signal at the infusion site. Hypothetically, gene delivery could be a safer and more effective means of long-term delivery of growth factors to the nervous system compared to chronic infusions and implanted hardware. However, such conclusions cannot be made in the absence of high-quality clinical trial data demonstrating both the safety and efficacy of in vivo gene delivery. Neurotransmitter Gene Therapy for PD Another potential means of using gene therapy in the nervous system in PD is the replacement of neurotrans- mitters. Neurotransmitter replacement could provide more physiological levels of transmitter replacement in diseases such as PD to smooth out debilitating motor fluctuations that occur in later stages of oral dopamine agonist therapy. Nearly 15 years ago, Wolff and col- leagues used an ex vivo gene delivery approach to pro- vide the dopamine synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) to rats with experimentally induced PD (Wolff et al. , 1989). They showed elevated striatal levels of dopamine and functional recovery. Subsequent studies using TH replacement, or replacement of another enzyme in the dopamine synthesis pathway, dopamine decarboxylase, have continued to support the feasibility of transmitter-synthesizing gene delivery to the striatum (Kang et al. , 1993; Bankiewicz et al. , 1998; Azzouz, 2002). Clinical trials using this approach are actively being considered. The primary shortcoming of this approach is an uncertainty that the efficacy and safety of nonregulated gene delivery for transmitter syn- thesis enzymes will exceed that of simple oral agents that are currently available. And unlike growth factor gene delivery, neurotransmitter replacement would not be neuroprotective. Surgical lesions have recently gained (or regained) substantial popularity in PD treatment, together with a more recent shift to the implantation of stimulating electrodes (deep brain stimulation) to block aberrant excitability in neural systems that contribute to PD symptoms. Taking the approach of a “chemical” lesion of the subthalamic nucleus by gene transfer of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD, the synthetic enzyme for the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA), a clinical trial of in vivo AAV GAD gene delivery is ongoing for PD (Luo et al. , 2002). In rodent studies, GAD gene delivery was reported to be effective in reducing the activity of sub- thalamic circuitry and improving PD-like symptoms. Lacking in this program is a clear rationale for pro- ceeding with the clinical trial based on compelling data from primate studies. Thus it is difficult to objectively Prospects for Gene Therapy for Central Nervous System Disease 277 Ch15.qxd 9/1/04 6:43 AM Page 277"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"assess the feasibility of this clinical program. Whereas some risk is justifiable in using a growth factor gene therapy program that offers the potential of fundamen- tally altering the primary pathogenesis of a neurode- generative disease such as PD by preventing cell loss, the rationale for transmitter replacement is less clear; therefore the preclinical data should be at least equally strong to that of a growth factor approach. At present, it is not. Growth Factor Gene Therapy in ALS and Huntington’s Disease Growth factors have been identified that are neuro- protective and functionally beneficial in models of Huntington’s disease and ALS, offering again the poten- tial to improve disease treatment by reducing cell death. Ex vivo gene delivery of ciliary neurotrophic factor in rodent and primate models of Huntington’s disease ameliorates cell loss and promotes functional recovery (Emerich et al. , 1996, 1997). More recently, AAV- in vivo gene delivery of GDNF was reported to exhibit benefi- cial functional effects in a rat model of Huntington’s dis- ease (McBride et al. , 2003). Given the lack of alternative therapies for this neurodegenerative disorder, clinical tri- als of growth factor gene delivery are being contem- plated. ALS is a relentlessly progressive and untreatable neu- rodegenerative disorder. BDNF, GDNF, ciliary neu- rotrophic factor, and insulin-like growth factor I have separately been reported to improve cell survival and functional outcomes in animal models of the disease. Clinical trials with protein infusions of these growth fac- tors have been conducted and failed (Group, 1996, 1999). Yet again, it is likely the case that the routes of growth factor administration in these trials (peripheral or ICV) failed to reach motor neurons in sufficient concentra- tions to elicit biological stimulation of cell bodies. However, targeted delivery to motor neurons distributed along the neuraxis in ALS will be practically difficult to achieve. Two gene therapy studies, the first using aden- ovirus to deliver GDNF (Mohajeri et al. , 1999) and the second using AAV to deliver insulin-like growth factor I (Kaspar, et al. , 2003), reported that localized delivery of growth factors to functionally critical motor neuronal groups, such as diaphragmatic motor neurons, can pro- long survival in animal models of ALS. Adenovirus and AAV are transported in a retrograde fashion to motor neurons of the spinal cord when injected into muscle. Thus, central neuronal rescue in this disease might be achievable following peripheral gene delivery. These pos- sibilities are also the subject of ongoing deliberation with regard to initiation of clinical trials. Gene Therapy for Inborn Errors of Metabolism A significant potential for the field of gene delivery is to replace absent or mutant enzymes in inborn errors of metabolism. Beneficial effects of in vivo gene transfer in several animal models of inborn errors of metabolism affecting the nervous system have been reported, including lysosomal storage disease (mucopolysaccharidosis) (Li and Davidson, 1995; Daly et al. , 1999; Stein et al. , 1999), metachromatic leukodystrophy (Consiglio et al. , 2001), α -sarcoglycan-deficient mice (Allamand et al. , 2000), arylsulfatase A deficiency (Learish, et al. , 1996), β -hex- osaminidase deficiency (the gene affected in Tay-Sachs disease) (Lacorazza et al. , 1996), galactosialidosis (Hahn et al. , 1998), and Fabry disease (Takenaka et al. , 2000). Gene replacement to the bone marrow early in life, or to the neuraxis either early or at slightly later time points, could provide biochemically and symptomatically beneficial therapies for many of these diseases that are otherwise untreatable. Some active work is ongoing in an attempt to bring these potential therapies to clinical trials. The first human gene therapy trial in the nervous sys- tem in fact attempted to deliver the enzyme aspartoacy- lase, which is deficient throughout the neuraxis, to children with Canavan’s disease (Leone et al. , 2000). AAV vectors coding for aspartoacylase were injected intraventricularly in two children. This route of ICV injection rendered remote the probability that the desired gene product would be widely accessible to the brain parenchyma. Another clinical trial in Canavan’s disease is underway in the United States, using multiple intra- parenchymal injections of in vivo AAV expressing aspar- toacylase. Gene Therapy for Nervous System Trauma Another potential application of gene therapy is to locally deliver growth-promoting substances, such as growth factors, to focal sites of CNS injury to promote cell survival and axon growth. For example, growth fac- tor gene delivery in models of spinal cord injury has stimulated the growth of injured axons and generated modest functional recovery in some cases (Grill et al. , 1997; Liu et al. , 1999; Tuszynski, 2002). Growth factor effects are sustained in the larger spinal cords of pri- mates (Tuszynski, 2002). Nonetheless, restoring neural circuitry after injury remains a great challenge. An important challenge for the practical implementation of growth factor gene delivery in spinal cord injury is the need for regulated gene delivery. Continuous activation of growth factor production in sites of spinal cord injury leads to failure of axons to regenerate beyond the 278 Prospects for Gene Therapy for Central Nervous System Disease Ch15.qxd 9/1/04 6:43 AM Page 278"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"lesion site because they become “trapped” within the growth factor source. There is a need to turn growth factor gene expression sequentially “on” and then “off ” at an injury site to promote axonal growth into, through, and beyond the lesion site. Such studies are ongoing. The prospect of gene delivery to prevent neu- ronal loss after brain trauma is also a possibility (Lu et al. , 2001). Most applications for growth factor deliv- ery for trauma will require brief bursts of gene expres- sion, or, perhaps more likely, short-term growth factor infusion. Gene Therapy for Nervous System Cancer Gene therapy has been investigated in models of intracranial glioma for some time (Short et al. , 1990). In one set of studies, death-inducing genes such as thymi- dine kinase can be introduced into rapidly dividing tumor cells in vivo , or passively transferred by injecting cells that express thymidine kinase into the tumor. On addition of the drug gancyclovir, cells that have incor- porated thymidine kinase are killed, together with neigh- boring cells (Barba et al. , 1994; Alavi and Eck, 2001). Early clinical trials are underway. In another approach, genetically modified herpes viruses that express genes to augment presentation of tumor antigens to the host immune system are injected into tumors (Ram et al. , 1997; Shand et al. , 1999; Cohen et al. , 2000; Rainov, 2000; Alavi and Eck, 2001; Markert et al. , 2001; Nanda et al. , 2001a; Todo et al. , 2001). Clinical trials with her- pes virus-based approaches to gliomas are in Phase III clinical trials. Optimizing Gene Delivery for the Future Regulatable Vectors An important safety feature that will optimize the future of gene therapy will be the ability to control gene expression in vivo , turning gene therapy expression sys- tems “on” and “off ” at will. Such regulatable expression systems have been under development for some time (Gossen et al. , 1994). Ultimately, it is hoped that regulat- able vectors will be able not only to stop gene delivery should an adverse event occur, but allow the physician to adjust the therapeutic dose of a delivered gene product in vivo much in the way that pharmacological drug doses can be adjusted. The most thoroughly studied regulatable expression system is probably the tetracycline-sensitive system, developed by Bujard and colleagues (Gossen et al. , 1994). In this controlled expression system, an operon is normally bound to a promoter and allows gene expres- sion to occur. When tetracycline is present, however, it binds to the operon, causing it to dissociate from the promoter, turning gene expression off (“tet-off ” system). The inverse of this regulatable scheme has also been con- structed, wherein the operon binds to the promoter only in the presence of tetracycline, turning gene expression on (“tet-on” system). Using the tet-off system, we have shown that the ability of NGF gene delivery to rescue cholinergic neurons can be completely eliminated by administering an oral tetracycline analog, doxycycline (Blesch et al. , 2001). When tested in primates, however, the tetracycline-regulated system lost efficacy over time because of the formation of host antibodies to its regu- latory components (Favre et al. , 2002). Hence, this sys- tem requires further development before becoming practical for clinical use. Other systems for regulating gene expression in vivo have been developed, including systems that are regulated in the presence of the steroid ecdysone (Suhr et al. , 1998), and “suicide” systems that can kill genetically modified cells if an “escape” from gene therapy is needed (Nanda et al. , 2001b). Regulatable systems are the subject of ongoing studies. Convection-Enhanced Gene Delivery Although localized delivery of a therapeutic gene is a clear strength of gene therapy in the nervous system, the practical distance over which genes of interest can be delivered to the brain can sometimes be limiting. For example, in Parkinson’s disease, the entire striatum may need to be targeted to effectively deliver growth factor or neurotransmitter genes. “Convection-enhanced” delivery methods have been developed for the delivery of cyto- toxic agents to brain tumors, and the same techniques have been adopted for use in delivering genes to broader areas of the brain such as the striatum (Bankiewicz et al. , 1998). Similar approaches could be useful in inborn errors of metabolism, where broad distribution of a therapeutic gene might be needed to achieve phenotypic correction. CONCLUSIONS AND PROSPECTS The development of molecularly based therapies in medicine moves inevitably forward. As knowledge regard- ing the human genome, mechanisms of gene and cell function, and the development of practical gene delivery systems move rapidly forward, so too does the potential for developing more effective therapies for neurological disease. Together with this remarkable potential for alter- ing the landscape of medical therapy comes a need for responsibility on the part of investigators to implement their clinical trials in a rationale and evidence-based manner. Upon this strong foundation of science and Prospects for Gene Therapy for Central Nervous System Disease 279 Ch15.qxd 9/1/04 6:43 AM Page 279"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"responsibility, it is not unlikely that the fate of people facing untreatable diseases will be markedly improved within our lifetimes. Gene therapy is part of the new era of molecular med- icine. Merging the potential of growth factors to rescue neurons with gene therapy technology that can deliver therapeutic substances across the blood-brain barrier into specific and restricted brain regions, the possibility exists that neuronal degeneration could be significantly reduced in neurological disorders. Gene therapy’s poten- tial is broader still, with the possibility of replacing defi- cient or mutant genes in inborn errors of metabolism or replacing deficient neurotransmitters in the brain. The newest generation of in vivo gene delivery vectors signi- ficantly improved the safety profile of gene therapy, although the need for regulatable expression vectors remains.

The use of these insights in the devel- opment of pharmacological therapy is covered in detail. Other chapters by Tuszynski, Goldman, Gage, and Isacson discuss the development of other treatment modalities: gene therapy and stem cell therapy, respectively. POSITIONAL CLONING Much of biomedical research is based on the premise that finding the cause of a disease is the best way to develop effective treatment. Identifying the primary defect responsible for a disease also brings new insight into normal biological structure and function. Since the mid-1980s, the strategy of positional cloning has been enormously useful in finding the causes of hereditary dis- eases (Figure 16.1). The path first followed with disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and cystic fibro- sis—gathering DNA samples from clinically character- ized patients and family members, studying these samples with genetic markers of known chromosomal location to determine which markers segregate with the disease, and analyzing candidate genes in the chromosomal interval defined by genetic linkage to find the gene that is specif- ically mutated in the disease—has now been followed with hundreds of other hereditary diseases. Disease gene identification allows accurate diagnostic testing in patients and prenatal, presymptomatic, and carrier test- ing in unaffected family members; it allows the develop- ment of cell culture and animal models that can be used to delineate the disease mechanism; and it leads to the identification of molecular targets for therapeutic inter- vention. The fruits of the Human Genome Project have greatly facilitated positional cloning in recent years (see Chapter 13). Millions of genetic markers—simple sequence repeat and single nucleotide polymorphisms—have been identi- fied and mapped, and comprehensive sequence analysis has led to detailed maps of genes of known and unknown function throughout the human genome. Advances in genotyping and sequencing technology have sped up the process of gene mapping and identification considerably. Nonetheless, there are many more disease genes yet to be found; of more than 14,000 defined hereditary diseases and genetic loci in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database, only 285 CHAPTER 16 Therapeutics Development for Hereditary Neurological Diseases Jill Heemskerk, PhD Kenneth H.

Many of the diseases with genes still to be found are neurological, and each of these offers the possibility of new insights into nervous system struc- ture and function and new opportunities for refined diag- nosis and therapeutic development. For the neurological disease genes that have already been identified, more needs to be done to connect genotype to phenotype, to work out the details of the disease mechanism, and to develop effective treatment. POLYGLUTAMINE DISEASE In 1991, the primary defect responsible for X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) was identi- fied as an expanded trinucleotide (CAG) repeat in the androgen receptor gene (La Spada et al. , 1991). SBMA is an adult-onset, slowly progressive disease with progres- sive weakness of the bulbar and extremity muscles result- ing from degeneration of motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord. The repeat expansion mutation leads to an expanded polyglutamine tract in the amino terminal domain of the androgen receptor protein. The androgen receptor is a nuclear receptor, a member of the steroid and thyroid hormone receptor family, and the amino ter- minal domain is likely involved in interaction with other nuclear proteins and is separate from the hormone and DNA binding domains. Although the mutation causes some loss of normal androgen receptor function, as evi- denced by functional studies (Mhatre et al. , 1993; Brooks et al. , 1997) and by the signs and symptoms of androgen insensitivity that often occur in patients with SBMA, the primary effect of the mutation is to cause a toxic gain of function in the receptor protein (i.e., it alters the protein structure such that the receptor becomes toxic to motor neurons). This conclusion is based on the finding that animals and humans with other mutations that cause a partial or complete loss of androgen receptor function have a different phenotype, with feminization but not the progressive weakness and motor neuron loss of SBMA. Further support for a toxic gain of function mechanism comes from the finding that the mutant protein is toxic and reproduces features of the disease phenotype when introduced into cultured cells and transgenic animals (Merry et al. , 1998; Abel et al. , 2001). When the gene responsible for Huntington’s disease was identified (Huntington’s Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993), it was found to have the same kind of CAG/polyglutamine expansion mutation as had been found in SBMA. Although the clinical manifesta- tions of Huntington’s disease (chorea, psychological problems, and cognitive decline) differ from the progres- sive weakness of SBMA, and the cell type most suscepti- ble to degeneration is the medium spiny neuron of the caudate nucleus rather than the primary motor neuron in the brainstem and spinal cord, the diseases are similar in that they are both adult-onset, neurodegenerative disor- ders. In subsequent years, seven more neurodegenerative diseases were found to be caused by CAG/polyglutamine expansion, including six spinocerebellar ataxias and den- tatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (Zoghbi and Orr, 2000). Although caused by mutations in different genes and involving different neuronal cell populations, these disorders likely share the same basic mechanism of length-dependent polyglutamine toxicity. The protein context likely determines the neuronal specificity, but the toxicity is inherent to the polyglutamine tract. These dis- eases may all thus be seen as variants of the same disor- der: polyglutamine expansion neurodegenerative disease. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the neu- ronal toxicity of expanded polyglutamine (Ross, 2002). The expanded proteins are prone to aggregation, with a similar repeat length threshold for aggregation and dis- ease. There is evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and excitotoxicity. Mutant polyglutamine may impair protea- somal function, with consequent effects on protein turnover. Loss of normal protein function may con- tribute to the pathology in Huntington’s disease as well as SBMA. Nuclear inclusions of mutant protein are seen in autopsied patients and in animal models of polygluta- mine disease; and in model systems, toxicity can be enhanced by nuclear localization, indicating that the cell nucleus may be an important site of toxic interaction. There is evidence to support early transcriptional dysreg- ulation and sequestration/depletion of important nuclear proteins in the disease mechanism. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. The challenge now in poly- glutamine disease research is to identify the critical path- ways in the pathogenesis and to develop treatment aimed at targets along these paths. Well-established cell culture and animal models are available for this purpose. SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive form of motor neuron disease, with onset in infancy or childhood. SMA patients have marked proxi- mal muscle weakness and in severe cases early death owing to respiratory failure. SMA is caused by deletion and other mutations of the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene on chromosome 5 (Lefebvre et al. , 1995). Disease severity correlates with the decrease in SMN protein levels (Lefebvre et al. , 1997). SMN is a ubiqui- tously expressed protein that plays a role in the assembly and stability of spliceosomes, and SMN deficiency leads to defects in mRNA splicing (Pellizzoni et al. , 1998). Ch16.qxd 9/2/04 10:28 AM Page 286"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"The SMN gene is normally present in two copies on chromosome 5: SMN1 , which is mutated in SMA, and SMN2 . SMN2 differs from SMN1 at a single nucleotide in exon 7 that leads to exon skipping in a majority of transcripts from this gene and a failure to produce full length protein. Cell culture and mouse models have been developed for SMA (Wang and Dreyfuss, 2001; Monani et al. , 2000). An attractive approach to SMA treatment is to increase levels of expression or promote correct splic- ing of transcripts from SMN2 . Drug screens have led to several candidates that up-regulate SMN2 , including sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor (Chang et al. , 2001). The main questions in SMA research now are: (1) How does SMN deficiency cause selective degen- eration of motor neurons, and (2) What can be done to mitigate the manifestations of the disease? HEREDITARY NEUROPATHY AND MOTOR NEURON DISEASE The characteristic clinical phenotype of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), includes progressive weakness, muscle atrophy, and sensory and reflex loss most prominent in the distal extremities (see Chapter 24). The same clinical features can occur with either demyelination or axonal degeneration in the peripheral nerves. There are more than 30 genetic loci for hereditary neuropathy, and at least 18 genes have now been identified (http://molgen- www.uia.ac.be/CMTMutations/). The more common demyelinating neuropathy genes were found in the early 1990s, but only recently have the rarer axonal neuropathy genes begun to be identified. Axonal neuropathy genes found recently encode proteins important in axon struc- ture and transport, including kinesin family member 1B (CMT2A), lamin A (CMT2B1), and neurofilament light chain (CMT2E). The recently discovered CMT2D gene suggests a different mechanism (Antonellis et al. , 2003). More work is needed to identify additional axonal neu- ropathy genes and in determining how mutations in these genes cause axonal degeneration. Each new gene that is found is another piece of the jigsaw puzzle that repre- sents axonal biology and pathophysiology. Hereditary motor neuron disease includes SMA and SBMA (discussed previously) and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). About 20% of familial ALS patients have mutations in the gene for SOD1, with inex- orably progressive weakness and spasticity due to degen- eration of both upper and lower motor neurons, similar to what is seen in sporadic ALS patients (Rosen et al. , 1993). Other patients with hereditary motor neuron dis- ease have a more benign course (e.g., ALS2, caused by mutations in the gene for alsin) (Yang et al. , 2001; Hadano et al. , 2001); dominantly inherited distal SMA, which resembles CMT2D and results from mutations in the same gene (Antonellis et al. , 2003); ALS4, which is caused by mutations in the senataxin gene (Chen et al. , 2004); and distal SBMA with vocal fold paralysis, which is caused by mutation in the gene for a subunit of dyn- actin (Puls et al. , 2003). As with hereditary neuropathy, more motor neuron disease genes remain to be found, and for those that have been found, more needs to be learned about the pathophysiology. The new insights that have been gained into the causes and mechanisms of hereditary motor neuron disease need to be used to develop effective treatment for patients with these and other sporadic forms of motor neuron disease. FRIEDREICH’S ATAXIA Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive disease, the most common inherited form of ataxia. Clinical manifestations usually start in childhood or ado- lescence and include distal weakness, sensory loss, and cardiomyopathy, as well as loss of coordination and gait difficulty. Pathologically, there is degeneration of periph- eral nerve and spinocerebellar pathways; the primary sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia are particu- larly vulnerable. The genetic cause is mutation, most commonly an intronic repeat expansion, in the gene for frataxin, a nuclear encoded mitochondrial protein (Campuzano et al. , 1996; Koutnikova et al. , 1997). Loss of frataxin function leads to iron accumulation in mito- chondria and oxidative damage (Puccio & Koenig, 2000). Small clinical trials have indicated that patients with car- diomyopathy benefit from treatment with the antioxidant idebenone (Rustin et al. , 2002; Mariotti et al. , 2003). It remains to be determined whether treatment with higher doses over a longer period of time has a beneficial effect on the neurological manifestations that are the major problem in FRDA. MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY The muscular dystrophies are a set of over twenty hereditary diseases that involve progressive degeneration of muscle. Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the most common and severe of these diseases, is caused by muta- tions in the gene for the muscle structural protein dystrophin. Becker’s dystrophy is a less severe disease caused by other mutations in the same gene. Four limb girdle dystrophies (which resemble Duchenne and Becker’s dystrophies except that they have autosomal rather than X-linked recessive inheritance) are caused by mutations in genes for the sarcoglycans, which are Therapeutics Development for Hereditary Neurological Diseases 287 Ch16.qxd 9/2/04 10:28 AM Page 287"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"structurally linked to dystrophin and associated with the muscle plasma membrane. Therapeutic strategies for Duchenne and Becker’s dystrophies have included up- regulation of the dystrophin-related protein utrophin (similar to the up-regulation of SMN2 to substitute for SMN1 , described previously), replacement of muscle with transplanted myoblasts or stem cells, gene replace- ment with naked DNA or viral vectors, and transcript correction with oligonucleotides that promote exon skip- ping. The gene for dystrophin is too large for currently available viral delivery systems (although truncated ver- sions with preserved function may fit); the sarcoglycan genes are smaller and suitable for packaging into aden- ovirus and adeno-associated virus. Gene replacement and the other strategies have shown some promise in ani- mal experiments, but safety and efficacy have not yet been demonstrated in patients. PHARMACOLOGICAL DRUG DISCOVERY FOR NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS Although a critical step toward finding a therapy, the identification of disease-causing genes is a very early stage in the drug discovery process. After a target for drug discovery has been identified, it may be years before a compound is identified that has the desired effect at that target. Even once an active compound is identified, the industry-wide estimate for time to the start of clinical testing is more than 4 years, with clinical testing and reg- ulatory approval requiring an additional 7.5 years on average (DiMasi et al. , 2003). As we discuss later, the genes linked to neurological disorders are not necessarily drug targets in and of themselves, and additional time is likely to be necessary to boot strap from the causative gene to a suitable target molecule. The following sections outline the standard industry approach to target-based drug development, describe the particular challenges for genetic neurological disorders, and present novel approaches for rising to meet these challenges. COMMERCIAL DRUG DISCOVERY A now standard approach to drug discovery in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is the use of high throughput drug screening (HTS, Fox et al. , 2002). HTS involves testing hundreds of thousands, even millions, of chemical compounds to find the rare ones that have activity against a molecular target of interest. This is made possible by the use of multiwell plates (e.g., 384-well plates) and automated, assembly line handling and analysis. The assays used in automated screening are necessarily simple, such as enzyme activity assays or cell viability assays; thus a simple molecular or cellular model must be developed for HTS to be practical in any disease area. The compounds that are screened in HTS approaches are chosen largely for their chemical diversity. The aim is to represent as many chemical struc- tures as possible to maximize the chances of finding a novel activity. The pharmaceutical properties of the com- pounds screened are defined only very generally if at all, with the goal of empirical discovery of novel chemical activities. Depending on the assay, HTS may yield an initial suc- cess rate of 0.1% to 1% of the compounds screened; thus screening of 100,000 compounds might yield 100 or 1000 positive compounds, or hits. However, 90% or more of these initial hits may be false-positive results: while the large scale, automated screening approach allows testing of many compounds simultaneously, the necessary sim- plicity of the experimental design gives an inherently high error rate. These hits must therefore undergo a rig- orous confirmation process that includes dose response testing and verifying the activities in other related assays. Prioritization of hit compounds also involves assessment of the potential suitability for pharmaceutical develop- ment of the compounds, based on the pharmacological properties of active compounds and the structure-activ- ity relationship with other active compounds. At the end of this process, there will perhaps be only 1 in 100 hit compounds warranting further consideration. It is important to realize that, although compounds that reach this stage are a refined set compared to the starting compounds, even these confirmed hits are not yet viable leads. In general, most of the hit compounds will prove to be impractical for drug development. All chemi- cal compounds have some level of inherent toxicity, and the potency of activity of a compound must be high enough that the dose required for clinical benefit would be well below that at which intolerable toxicity or side effects would occur. Iterative rounds of medicinal chem- istry are required to modify the compounds in an attempt to increase the potency of a compound and decrease its toxicity before it can safely enter clinical testing. The final stages of drug development before the start of clinical t esting are detailed pharmacological and toxi- cological studies (FDA Guidance, 1997). Pharmacological studies are done in rodents and other animals to determine whether the compound can get to its intended target at suf- ficient levels and be broken down and eliminated without toxicity. The rigorous toxicology testing required to begin human testing involves short- and long-term evaluation in multiple organ systems of both rodents and larger animals. In vitro genotoxicity studies are also generally required. Given the effort and time required to transform a chemical compound into a drug, it is not surprising that 288 Therapeutics Development for Hereditary Neurological Diseases Ch16.qxd 9/2/04 10:28 AM Page 288"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"industry tends to focus attention on disease areas with large patient populations and well-defined pathways to useful therapies. This is even less surprising considering that only one compound in five that enter clinical trials ever becomes a marketed drug (PhRMA Profile, 2003). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has instituted orphan drug incentives that have encouraged some biotechnology companies to take on development of drugs for small disease areas (Milne, 2002), but most of the drug development burden for genetic neurological diseases has thus far been taken on by private disease foundations and government funded academic researchers. As described next, this has led to the devel- opment of new approaches that may have broad impact on drug discovery in general (Verkman, 2004). CHALLENGES OF THE GENETIC NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS One of the most important considerations in how readily the identification of a gene will lead to a thera- peutic strategy is the nature of the gene product. The range of drug targets used in industry is relatively nar- row, and many pharmaceutical and biotechnology com- panies favor target classes that have formed the basis of prior drug development efforts (Knowles and Gromo, 2003). These include G-protein-coupled receptors, nuclear hormone receptors, serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, serine proteases, phosphodiesterases, and ion channels (Hopkins and Groom, 2002). As discussed ear- lier in this chapter, the genes linked to most genetic neu- rological disorders do not fall into the industry definition of “druggable” targets. One strategy for making these diseases more amenable to drug discovery on the industry model is to identify targets involved in the disease mechanism that may be more amenable to therapeutics development, such as kinases or receptors. However, much basic mechanistic work will be required to understand the causative pathways in these diverse diseases. Many of the genes identified by positional cloning, such as frataxin, are novel, and their function is as yet incom- pletely understood (Puccio and Koenig, 2000). Others, such as mutant SOD1, carry mutations that confer unknown toxic functions on an otherwise well-charac- terized protein (Cleveland and Rothstein, 2001). Although indicators of oxidative stress and other cellu- lar dysfunction may correlate with the presence of the disease-causing mutations, it is not yet known where in the hierarchy of cellular events these mechanisms occur. Further, because the mutations are present throughout development and life, it is necessary to determine the period required for the gene function to cause the dis- ease phenotype in order to know when an intervention might produce clinical improvement. Thus an impor- tant challenge that remains after the identification of a disease-causing gene is the need to understand its mech- anism of action. NOVEL PROTEIN TARGETS With the current lack of standard drug targets, aca- demic investigators are developing novel strategies for drug discovery. Screening efforts with atypical protein targets, such as expanded polyglutamine tracts and α -synuclein are underway with encouraging results (Conway et al. , 2001, Heemskerk et al. , 2002). These in vitro screens are based on the propensity of purified mutant proteins to form aggregates in solution, and chemical compounds are screened for their ability to dis- rupt or prevent this aggregation. This approach identifies compounds that exert their effect through direct interac- tion with the disease-causing proteins. From a therapeu- tic standpoint, the underlying hypothesis that preventing aggregation will be clinically beneficial is untested, and as such it may not be appealing for commercial drug dis- covery efforts. However, active compounds can be used to test this idea in the academic setting, and the develop- ment of tools for hypothesis testing is one of the goals of such screens. Active compounds can be evaluated in mouse models to determine whether the in vitro effects of a compound can be reproduced in vivo and, if so, whether the effects are beneficial. Thus chemical com- pound screening can provide research tools to determine the disease mechanisms and to test whether an approach holds promise for drug discovery. WHOLE CELL TARGET-BASED ASSAYS Cellular assays have also been developed based on neurogenetic targets. In these assays, the behavior of a disease-linked protein is measured in the context of the whole cell. Examples are aggregation of proteins with expanded polyglutamine tracts and mutant SOD1 (Pollitt et al. , 2003, Heemskerk et al. , 2002), and activa- tion of caspase 3 in response to mutant proteins (Piccioni et al. , 2004). Although effects on a specific protein or metabolic pathway are measured in these assays, an active compound could in principle exert its effect through interaction with any protein in the cell. This strategy allows the identification of compounds based on targets that have not yet been precisely identified. As dis- cussed later, active compounds can then be used to iden- tify interacting proteins, thus providing new targets for further drug discovery. Therapeutics Development for Hereditary Neurological Diseases 289 Ch16.qxd 9/2/04 10:28 AM Page 289"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"PHENOTYPIC ASSAYS Assays have also been developed that make no assumptions about the mechanism of action of a disease- causing protein. These assays measure the phenotypic effects of expression of disease proteins, such as cellular toxicity caused by expression of expanded polyglutamine and mutant SOD1 (Igarashi et al. , 2003; Heemskerk et al. , 2002) or by reduced function of SMN (Wang and Dreyfuss, 2001). As with other cell-based assays, com- pounds active in these assays may act at any point in a disease cascade and thus provide an opportunity to iden- tify new components of the disease pathways in an approach known as chemical genetics (Stockwell, 2002; Lokey, 2003). Because the assay does not rely on specific knowledge of the mechanism of action of the proteins that cause disease, these assays have the further advan- tage that active compounds can be used to determine the underlying causes of toxicity. Such assays tend not to be favored in industry drug discovery efforts because the medicinal chemistry required to optimize leads is hampered by the lack of a known target. The design of chemical modifications to maximize the potency of an interaction is most efficient when guided by knowledge of both interacting partners (i.e., target and ligand). This limitation can be overcome by (1) screening with collections of clinically tested com- pounds that may have known targets and are already optimized for human use or (2) using the active com- pounds from phenotypic screens to identify their cellular targets. These strategies are discussed further next. SCREENS WITH CLINICALLY TESTED COMPOUNDS Although medicinal chemistry is possible without a known target, the process is expedited when the starting compound has favorable pharmaceutical features such as low toxicity and availability in vivo . Bioactive compounds, including clinically tested or approved drugs, natural products, and narcotics, are compounds that have been optimized, either through medicinal chemistry or natural selection, for activity in biological systems. In the event that hits with such compounds are not sufficiently potent in the assay of interest, chemical analogs with similar pharmacological properties are often available that can be tested for increased potency. A second advantage of screening with clinically approved drugs and known bioactive compounds is that these compounds have been observed to give a higher hit rate than compounds chosen for chemical diversity (Stockwell, 2003); therefore, con- firmed hits can be identified from starting collections as small as several hundred compounds (Korth et al. , 2001; Conway et al. , 2001; Piccioni et al. , 2004). Because of the high success rate with a relatively small collection of com- pounds, the bioactive screening approach is applicable for more complex models such as C. elegans (Heemskerk et al. , 2002) and Drosophila (Muqit and Feany, 2002; Heemskerk et al. , 2002). Screening of bioactive com- pound collections is ideally suited to academia where the desire to make new biological discoveries outweighs the desire to claim novel intellectual property for commercial purposes. Screens with clinically approved drugs can also be commercially viable as a drug discovery approach, because the FDA orphan drug act provides commercial incentives for finding new rare disease indications for previously marketed drugs (Milne, 2002). TARGET IDENTIFICATION Various methods have been developed to identify the molecular targets of compounds identified in cell-based and phenotypic screens (Lokey, 2003). Once identified, these targets can be used in further screens to identify additional active compounds. This stepwise approach to target selection has the advantage that two key features of the target are already known: first, that the target can be modulated to ameliorate the disease phenotype, at least in a model system; and second, that the activity of the target can be modified by interaction with small molecules. Methods for identifying the protein partners of active compounds include biochemical approaches using labeled or immobilized compounds and probing cDNA expres- sion cloning systems with labeled compounds (reviewed in Lokey, 2003). Given the somewhat promiscuous nature of bioactive compounds (Stockwell, 2003), targets identi- fied by in vitro binding must be further validated. The possibility of identifying the cellular targets of small mol- ecules in models of genetic neurological diseases provides hope that tractable drug development strategies for neu- rological disorders will emerge and will broaden the focus of commercial target-based drug discovery. From an industry perspective, the lack of reliable drug targets and predictive models for neurological disorders results in an extremely high level of economic risk (Choi, 2002). Despite the large potential markets for treatments of conditions such as stroke and Alzheimer’s disease, pharmaceutical and biotech companies have limited their efforts in neurotherapeutics development because of the high rate of failure in clinical testing of drug candidates for these disorders (Lee et al. , 1999; Fillit et al. , 2002). Thus, defining novel therapeutic targets and strategies for the genetic neurological disorders presents a valuable opportunity as well as a challenge. In addition to finding treatments for these diseases, the identification of new drug discovery approaches is likely to expand the industry 290 Therapeutics Development for Hereditary Neurological Diseases Ch16.qxd 9/2/04 10:28 AM Page 290"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"definition of druggable targets, thus increasing the variety of approaches to finding therapies in all disease areas.

The number of ion channels linked to neurological diseases continues to increase at a rate of one or two a year, and there are hints that the mutations associated with neurological diseases inherited in a mendelian fashion are only the tip of the iceberg: Subtle derangements of ion channel function may be at the root of idiopathic generalized epilepsy. This chapter summarizes the clinical features and genetic mechanisms underlying the known CNS channelopathies, assesses the state of understanding of the cellular mecha- nisms that explain the manifestations, and tentatively points the way to further progress in understanding the full impact of this fast-moving area for neurological therapeutics. The chapter concentrates on the genetic channelopathies and does not discuss autoimmune diseases affecting ion chan- nels. Nor does it consider the possibility that acquired defects in ion channel transcription contribute to disease mechanisms in a vast range of other areas of neurology. Moreover, muscle channelopathies are considered sepa- rately in this book, and are not discussed here, except where they shed light on CNS diseases caused by mutations of closely related ion channels. THE CNS CHANNELOPATHIES: A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE CHANNELS KNOWN TO BE AFFECTED The CNS channelopathies span a broad range of “classical” ion channels. These include voltage-gated channels known to underlie action potential initiation and repolarization, channels involved in membrane potential stabilization, and channels that mediate Ca ++ ion flux across membranes. The classical ion channels also include ligand-gated ion channels (ionotropic recep- tors) that mediate communication among neurons by opening an ion-selective pore in the plasma membrane in response to binding of neurotransmitter molecules. The classification of the neurological channelopathies is problematic because distinct mutations of the same ion channel can cause different clinical disorders and because, conversely, mutations of several different channels can converge onto a common clinical presentation. Moreover, some phenotypes that have been identified in association with ion channel mutations are indistinguishable from disorders that may have arisen from other mechanisms. Table 17.1 shows a genetic classification of those channelopathies known to be transmitted in a mendelian fashion and where the causative mutations have been identified. This implies that the mutation is sufficient to cause the phenotype and generally indicates dominant inheritance when it is present together with the wild-type allele, or recessive inheritance when it is homozygous. It must be borne in mind, however, that some dominantly inherited mutations (e.g., of nicotinic receptor subunit genes) show incomplete penetrance. Moreover, some recessive mutations in glycine receptor subunits can cause disease through compound heterozygosity. That is, an affected individual can inherit two different mutant alleles from clinically unaffected parents in whom each mutation behaves recessively. K + Channelopathies Voltage-gated K + channels are encoded by a very large family of genes that show considerable homology, 293 CHAPTER 17 Inherited Channelopathies of the CNS: Lessons for Clinical Neurology Dimitri M. Kullmann, MD, PhD Ch17.qxd 9/2/04 10:27 AM Page 293"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"294 Inherited Channelopathies of the CNS although they only account for a subset of all known K + channels. They generally open slowly upon membrane depolarization and mediate an outward K + flux that con- tributes to repolarizing neurons and/or stabilizing their membrane potential. These channels are composed of four pore-forming α subunits, together with four cyto- plasmic accessory β subunits. They share a common motif, with intracellular N and C terminals, six trans- membrane segments (of which the fourth has several positively charged residues that are critical for voltage- dependent activation), and a pore-lining region between the fifth and sixth segments. Mutations have been identi- fied in three different trans-membrane subunits: Kv1.1 (encoded by KCNA1), Kv7.2 (KCNQ2), and Kv7.3 (KCNQ3). Kv1.1 is the archetypal delayed rectifier chan- nel. That is, its properties are well described by Hodgkin- Huxley kinetics, and it was the first K + channel to be cloned from a mutant Drosophila strain that showed tem- perature-dependent shaking, hence its alternative name “Shaker channel.” It is thought to play an important role in repolarizing axons. As for Kv7.2 and Kv7.3, they have slow kinetics and open at relatively negative membrane potentials. Their physiological role has only recently been resolved, to a great extent as a result of progress in understanding the channelopathies (see later). Missense mutations of KCNA1 occur in association with the autosomal dominant disorder episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) (Browne et al. , 1994). This disorder is char- acterized by brief paroxysms of cerebellar incoordina- tion, frequently triggered by stress or exertion. In between attacks patients are generally unaffected, although many have myokymia (spontaneous discharges of motor units) implying hyperexcitability of motor axon terminals. More recently, the phenotypic range of this disorder has been broadened by the finding of patients with isolated episodic ataxia, or myokymia and cramp without ataxia (Eunson et al. , 2000). Moreover, some families appear to have a relatively severe form of EA1 that does not respond to the usual treatments (carba- mazepine or acetazolamide). Finally, epilepsy is found at a greater than expected rate in EA1 families. The other K + channels, Kv7.2 and Kv7.3, are both associated with benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC) (Biervert et al. , 1998; Charlier et al. , 1998; Singh et al. , 1998). This syndrome is also autosomal dominant and consists of frequent partial and generalized seizures beginning in the first week of life and generally resolving spontaneously by 6 weeks. A variety of electroen- cephalography (EEG) disturbances have been reported, but the interictal EEG is usually normal. The discovery of these channel subunits genes was prompted by linkage studies, which identified two loci for BFNC. Positional cloning led to the discovery of two closely related genes, KCNQ2 and KCNQ3.

The channel composed of both subunits has the kinetic and pharmacological properties of the so- called M current, an important conductance modulated by muscarinic receptors. In common with EA1, the pheno- typic spectrum of KCNQ2 mutations has recently been widened, with the discovery of a family with the combi- nation of neonatal convulsions and myokymia (Dedek et al. , 2001). Na + Channelopathies Voltage-gated Na + channels underlie the upstroke of fast-action potentials throughout the CNS. This family of channels is considerably smaller than the voltage-gated K + channels. Na + channels are made up of a single pore- lining α subunit, which resembles four voltage-gated K + channels in tandem (from which the Na + channel family probably evolved through twofold gene duplication). This subunit mediates the ion flux and contains the voltage- sensing and principal gating mechanisms. Na V 1.1 and Na V 1.2 are distributed in complementary patterns in many CNS neurons, with Na V 1.1 principally located to dendrites, where it probably underlies dendritic action potential, and Na V 1.2 in the axon, where it underlies action potential ini- tiation and propagation. Both channels have fast kinetics. They open very rapidly on depolarization, and then rap- idly inactivate in the presence of sustained depolarization. Two accessory subunits ( β 1 and β 2 ), containing single trans-membrane segments, are associated with each α subunit. The β 1 subunit further accelerates fast inactiva- tion, when the function of coexpressed α subunits is com- pared to the α subunit expressed alone. The first mutation to be found in a CNS Na + channel subunit gene was found in SCN1B, which encodes β 1 in association with a highly pleomorphic dominantly inher- ited syndrome, generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS + ) (Wallace et al. , 1998). This disorder is unusual in that it cannot be diagnosed in a single patient, but only when it is present in several members of a fam- ily. This occurs because individual members of affected families can have very different patterns of seizures, including febrile and nonfebrile convulsions persisting beyond childhood, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, but also myoclonic, absence and atonic seizures. Some mem- bers are also affected by myoclonic-astatic epilepsy, a malignant pediatric syndrome. The boundaries of this syndrome continue to expand, while the minimal diag- nostic criteria remain uncertain because neither febrile seizures nor epilepsy per se occurs universally. Mutations associated with GEFS + or similar familial syndromes (generalized febrile and nonfebrile seizures) have since been discovered in SCN1A (Na V 1.1) (Escayg et al. , 2000b) and SCN2A (Na V 1.2) (Sugawara et al. , 2001; Heron et al. , 2002). Further mutations have been discovered in association with a ligand-gated channel, the α 1 subunit of ionotropic γ -aminobutyric (GABA A ) receptors (see later). Ca ++ Channelopathies Voltage-gated Ca ++ channels activate upon membrane depolarization and inactivate relatively slowly in com- parison with Na + channels. They mediate an inward flux of Ca ++ ions, which, in some neurons (for instance in the thalamic reticular nucleus or in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum), can be sufficient to sustain a regenerative depolarization (a Ca ++ action potential). Another ubiqui- tous role for Ca ++ channels is to trigger a number of intracellular signaling cascades that depend on Ca ++ ,in particular neurotransmitter release at synapses. The pore-forming α 1 subunits of Ca ++ channels have a similar trans-membrane topology as Na + channels, with four repeated domains each containing six trans-membrane segments; however, the mechanisms of inactivation are different, as are the accessory subunits. At least two sub- units are associated with CNS Ca ++ channels: the α 2 δ subunit, most of which is extracellular, but which also contains a single trans-membrane segment, and the β subunit, which is cytoplasmic. These subunits exist in several isoforms encoded by different genes. The pharmacological and biophysical profile of Ca ++ channels is principally determined by the identity of the α 1 subunit, which itself undergoes alternative splicing. Thus, the CACNA1A gene encodes the α 1 A subunit of Ca V 2.1 channels, which, depending on the splice variant and together with accessory subunits, mediate a high- threshold, slowly inactivating current that is sensitive to certain invertebrate toxins. The older name P/Q-type current, which developed before the molecular classifi- cation of Ca ++ channels, reflects the variable inactiva- tion rates and toxin sensitivities of the individual splice variants of this gene product. Different mutations of CACNA1A give rise to dominantly inherited CNS dis- orders with a wide phenotypic spectrum. This includes familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM), a severe variant of migraine with aura, inherited in an autosomal domi- nant manner, where the aura can consist of focal weak- ness that mimics a stroke (Ophoff et al. , 1996). It also includes episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), which differs from EA1 in that paroxysms are more prolonged and often include migrainous features, and patients can develop a slowly progressive cerebellar degeneration. A pure progressive cerebellar ataxia without obvious fluctuations in severity is also recognized (spinocerebel- lar ataxia type 6, SCA6) (Zhuchenko et al. , 1997). Some Inherited Channelopathies of the CNS 295 Ch17.qxd 9/2/04 10:27 AM Page 295"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"preliminary evidence suggests that mutations of the β 4 auxiliary subunit may also be associated with CNS dis- ease (Escayg et al. , 2000a). Cl − Channelopathies In contrast to muscle fibers, Cl − channels play only a minor role in setting the resting membrane potential of neurons. These channels have a quite different structure from the cation-selective channels listed previously. Their function and subunit composition are relatively poorly understood, but at least some of them exist as homo- dimers, with two Cl − pores, which operate relatively inde- pendently. They are tonically active at rest, but allow Cl − ions to enter relatively more effectively at depolarized membrane potentials. Three different mutations of the ClC-2 channel (encoded by CLCN2) have recently been reported to cosegregate with autosomal dominant epilepsy (Haug et al. , 2003). Although the range of epileptic syndromes is narrower than in GEFS + ,it includes all forms of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE): childhood and juvenile absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and epilepsy with grand mal seizures on awakening. Nicotinic Receptor Channelopathies These receptors are heteropentameric ligand-gated cation channels that are activated by acetylcholine (the endogenous agonist) and nicotine (a widely used exoge- nous agonist). CNS nicotinic receptors are biophysically similar to the well-characterized receptors that mediate excitation at the neuromuscular junction; however, the subunit composition of CNS nicotinic receptors is differ- ent. An abundant subtype occurring in the thalamus and cortex is composed of α 4 and β 2 subunits. Its role is unclear. Although nicotinic receptors of this subtype are at least partially located to presynaptic structures and appear to enhance the release of other neurotransmitters, it is not clear under which circumstances this phenome- non occurs physiologically. Part of the difficulty of studying these receptors is that both acetylcholine and nicotine not only activate them but also powerfully desensitize them. Whether a similar form of desensitiza- tion occurs in response to synaptically released acetyl- choline is not known. Mutations in both α 4 and β 2 (encoded by CHRNA4 and CHRNB2) have been found in families affected by autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) (Steinlein et al. , 1995; De Fusco et al. , 2000; Phillips et al. , 2001). This disorder is characterized by clusters of convulsions arising from sleep, often with preserved consciousness. The attacks are sometimes misdiagnosed as parasomnias, partly because EEG abnormalities can be missed. The discovery of disease- associated CHRNA4 mutations, followed by CNRNB2 mutations, followed a similar sequence as that of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 mutations in association with BFNC. As mentioned previously, although within an individual family the mutation cosegregates with the dis- ease, there is evidence for incomplete penetrance, imply- ing that other factors, genetic or environmental, affect the seizure threshold. GABA A Receptor Channelopathies By comparison with nicotinic receptors, far more is known about the role of GABA A receptors in mediating fast GABAergic transmission in the CNS. They are abundantly expressed throughout the brain and spinal cord, and are frequently, although not exclusively, located in the postsynaptic membrane opposite GABA release sites of inhibitory interneurons. Although they have a similar heteropentameric composition as nicotinic receptors (and share a common trans-membrane topol- ogy and gating mechanisms), they are permeable to anions (Cl − and HCO 3 − ) instead of cations. Depending on the electrochemical trans-membrane gradient for these ions, their activation leads either to hyperpolariza- tion or to depolarization of the neuronal membrane. These effects are accompanied by a shunting effect on membrane resistance, which means that even when they depolarize neurons, GABA A receptors can attenuate the excitatory effects of other synaptic inputs. GABA A receptors are thus principally inhibitory, at least in adult tissue. GABA A receptors are made up of a wide variety of subunits, but two common constituents, which proba- bly coassemble in many receptors, are α 1 and γ 2 . Both subunits contribute to determining the kinetics, affinity, desensitization rate, and pharmacological profile of the receptors (i.e., the sensitivity to benzodiazepine, alcohol, and barbiturates among clinically relevant agents). The γ 2 subunit also contributes to synaptic targeting of GABA A receptors. Mutations of the γ 2 subunit, encoded by GABRG2, have been identified in several families with GEFS + or closely associated syndromes (Baulac et al. , 2001; Wallace et al. , 2001). And one family with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) has been reported to carry a mutation in the gene for α 1 GABRA1 (Cossette et al. , 2002). Glycine Receptor Channelopathies All of the channelopathies listed previously are domi- nantly transmitted. The exception is that familial hyper- ekplexia (FH) can arise from either dominant or recessive mutations of the GLRA1 gene, which encodes 296 Inherited Channelopathies of the CNS Ch17.qxd 9/2/04 10:27 AM Page 296"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"the α 1 subunit of glycine receptors (Shiang et al. , 1993; Brune et al. , 1996). This receptor also belongs to the nicotinic family, together with nicotinic acetylcholine and GABA A receptors. Although glycine receptors are abundant throughout the CNS, α 1 containing receptors are thought to mediate fast inhibitory transmission only in the spinal cord and brainstem. The receptors are het- eropentameric, composed of α 1 and β subunits. Patients with FH can present in infancy or later, with stiffness and exaggerated startle responses triggered by sounds or other unexpected stimuli. THE NATURE OF THE MOLECULAR LESION: CAN IT EXPLAIN THE PHENOTYPE? Mutations cause disease through several different genetic mechanisms, many of which occur among the channelopathies. Most of the mutations that have been identified are missense. However premature stop codons and splice site mutations that are predicted to truncate the peptide sequence also occur. SCA6 often arises from an expansion in a CAG repeat in the CACNA1A gene (Zhuchenko et al. , 1997), but this is the only known example of a disease caused by a polyglutamine tract in an ion channel gene. Ion channels are almost unique in that the conse- quences of mutations can be characterized in great detail with biophysical methods. Foremost among these are electrophysiological recordings from cells expressing mutant ion channels, in particular oocytes of Xenopus laevis and transfected mammalian cultures. This approach goes far beyond the level of analysis possible with conventional enzyme activity assays. In particular, voltage clamp recordings potentially allow an insight into the details of the voltage-dependence and ligand binding kinetics, opening probability, single channel con- ductance, and mean current density (a reflection of the population behavior of channels expressed in a whole cell). In addition, interactions with wild-type subunits, or accessory subunits can be assayed. Additional informa- tion comes from examining the subcellular distribution of mutated ion channels, which can be achieved either by immunocytochemistry or by tagging subunits with fluo- rescent molecules. Bearing in mind that altered channel properties may well give rise to compensatory alterations in the expres- sion of these and other proteins and also possibly to developmental alterations, the results of heterologous expression studies have begun to yield an insight into disease mechanisms. An alternative top-do wn approach to understand the disease mechanisms is to ask whether the channel is expected to enhance or decrease the excitability of neu- ronal circuits known to be involved in particular clinical disorders. Thus a simple view of epilepsy and paroxysmal and/or hyperkinetic movement disorders (hyperekplexia, episodic ataxia, hemiplegic migraine) is that they may arise from a failure of the mechanisms that normally repolarize and/or stabilize neuronal membranes, or an increase in mechanisms that depolarize them. This gives rise to the prediction that such disorders can result from deficient voltage K + channel function, failure of GABAergic or glycinergic inhibition, or gain of function of Na + and possibly Ca ++ channels. In some cases such top-down predictions are in gen- eral agreement with the results of heterologous expres- sion studies. Thus, missense mutations associated with KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 that have been expressed have been found to cause partial loss of function; the current density is reduced compared to wild-type (Biervert et al. , 1998; Schroeder et al. , 1998; Lerche et al. , 1999). Kinetics, how- ever, are apparently unchanged. Channels in an individual carrying a mutation in KCNQ2 potentially consist of three types of subunits: mutant and wild-type Kv7.2 and wild type Kv7.3. When this situation was reproduced in vitro by coexpressing all three DNA species, the cur- rent density reduction was decreased by only about 25% (Schroeder et al. , 1998). This implies that relatively mod- est degrees of loss of function are sufficient to give rise to the disease. It also explains the dominant inheritance of BFNC. Why most patients cease to have seizures after about 6 weeks of age is unclear, but this may reflect com- pensatory up regulation of other subunits, or a general decrease in the excitability of the neuronal circuitry where seizures initially arose as a result of impaired M current function. Missense KCNA1 mutations associating with EA1 also cause loss of function (Adelman et al. , 1995). This loss ranges from very mild changes in the voltage dependence or rate of activation and inactivation through to completely nonfunctional channels. Some of the mutations are not only unable to assemble to form functional channels, but also exert a dominant negative effect on the coexpressed wild-type K + channel subunits, possibly by coassembling with them and sequestering them within intracellular organelles (Rea et al. , 2002a). Mutations associated with a more severe clinical syn- drome (drug resistance and/or association with epilepsy) also cause more profound K + current reductions and/or dominant negative effects (Eunson et al. , 2000). Why patients with these mutations have paroxysms of ataxia is unclear. The strong expression of Kv1.1 in the cerebellum (where they occur in axons of GABAergic inhibitory neurons) hints at a failure of normal regulation of Purkinje cell output, a possibility that is supported by studies of mice with targeted deletion of the KCNA1 gene (Zhang et al. , 1999). A knock-in mouse model has Inherited Channelopathies of the CNS 297 Ch17.qxd 9/2/04 10:27 AM Page 297"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"lent further support to this view, in that the frequency of spontaneous GABAergic synaptic signals was increased in Purkinje cells, possibly because of hyperexcitability of the axons of interneurons (Herson et al. , 2003). Similar processes may underlie the occurrence of spontaneous action potentials in motor axons, providing a possible explanation for myokymia. Little is known of the events underlying the initiation and termination of a paroxysm of ataxia, although it has been suggested that the cere- bellar cortex may be susceptible to a phenomenon anal- ogous to cortical spreading depression (Ebner and Chen, 2003). Another example in which predictions from known functions of channels agree with the results of heterolo- gous expression is the association of GABA A receptor mutations with epilepsy. Several missense mutations of the γ 2 subunit cause partial loss of function, either by impairing the maximal opening probability of channels containing this subunit or by affecting its membrane expression (Baulac et al. , 2001; Wallace et al. , 2001; Bianchi et al. , 2002). The relatively modest predicted decrease in GABAergic transmission may be sufficient to explain the dominant inheritance. In common with other genetic causes of GEFS + , however, it is not known why different members of the same family exhibit highly disparate types of seizures. Finally, GLRA1 mutations in FH also impair the nor- mal function of glycine receptors. Dominantly inherited mutations tend to encode glycine receptors that are func- tional, albeit with reduced apparent affinity for the lig- and and/or decreased maximal current (Langosch et al. , 1994; Lewis et al. , 1998). In contrast, recessively inherited mutations tend to be nonfunctional. These include both missense and nonsense mutation (Brune et al. , 1996; Rea et al. , 2002b). This implies that the product of one wild- type allele is sufficient to mediate normal glycinergic inhibition. Haploinsufficiency does not appear to play a role in this disorder, in striking contrast to BFNC. An alternative mechanism that can potentially give rise to paroxysmal excessive neuronal discharges is gain of function of channels that underlie action potentials, namely Na + channels. Although some progress has been made in relating Na + channel mutations to GEFS + , here too, there are some major difficulties. The original SCN1B mutation discovered in a large kindred with GEFS + apparently causes complete loss of function of the β 1 subunit (Wallace et al. , 1998). Because this subunit normally accelerates the rate of fast inactivation, this is equivalent to a gain of function for Na + channels: they may remain open for longer than when the α subunit coassembles with the wild-type β 1 . This effect is similar to that seen for some mutations of the muscle Na + channel SCN4A associated with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. Some, but not all, heterologous expression studies that have examined missense mutations of SCN1A in GEFS + have also reported that they impair fast inactivation of Na + channels (Lossin et al. , 2002). Other reports, how- ever, have drawn attention to changes in voltage-depend- ent kinetics (Alekov et al. , 2001). An unexpected challenge to the view that enhanced Na + currents underlie seizures is the observation that nonsense mutations are a common cause of the malig- nant pediatric syndrome Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of infancy (Claes et al. , 2001). Many of these mutations are predicted to result in truncation of large and essential parts of the α subunit, and therefore should result in loss of function. A possible resolution of this paradox that remains to be explored is that the mutation results in compensatory overexpression of the wild-type allele, or of other Na + channels. Some channelopathies remain difficult to explain by asking whether a simple gain or loss of function can be expected to increase or decrease the excitability of the brain. The different disorders associated with Cav2.1 mutations are especially problematic. Different mutations associated with FHM have been reported to either increase or decrease Ca ++ current density on heterologous expression (Kraus et al. , 1998; Hans et al. , 1999). Moreover, the mutations have different effects on the volt- age dependence of activation and inactivation and single channel conductance, without a consistent pattern. Given the persistent uncertainty as to the site (let alone mecha- nism) of initiation of a migraine attack, it is difficult to know whether gain or loss of function of Ca ++ channels is expected from a top-down approach to the problem. An interesting recent suggestion is that, although the current density, which reflects population behavior of the chan- nels, is affected in different ways, at least one aspect of the behavior of single channels is consistently changed in the same direction by the different FHM mutations. The Ca ++ flux through an individual channel (which is the product of single channel conductance and open channel proba- bility) is consistently increased when relatively modest depolarizing steps are applied (Tottene et al. , 2002). This could mean that the disease arises from gain of Ca ++ channel function, assuming that other confounding phe- nomena, such as trafficking of the channels to the mem- brane, are not relevant to the role of the channels in sites critically involved in migraine initiation. This hypothesis is consistent with the “microdomain” hypothesis of Ca ++ - triggered transmitter release, which holds that only one or a few channels may be sufficient to mediate the Ca 2 + influx necessary to trigger vesicle exocytosis. Other mutations of Cav2.1 also present some difficul- ties in interpretation. In particular, conflicting reports exist about the effect of the SCA6-associated polyglutamine expansion on current density (Matsuyama et al. , 1999; Restituito et al. , 2000; Piedras-Renteria et al. , 2001). Given 298 Inherited Channelopathies of the CNS Ch17.qxd 9/2/04 10:27 AM Page 298"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"that some other polyglutamine disorders are thought to result from abnormal handling of the expanded region and intranuclear protein deposition, it is not clear whether any effect on channel function is relevant at all. Indeed, some neuropathological data suggest that surviving Purkinje cells of the cerebellum accumulate cytoplasmic inclusions, which are reminiscent of intranuclear inclu- sions seen in other polyglutamine expansion diseases (Ishikawa et al. , 2001). On the other hand, arguing against a cytotoxic effect of the expanded sequence is the finding that an apparently identical purely progressive ataxia can arise as a result of missense mutations of the same gene (Friend et al. , 1999). As for EA2, all the mutations that have been studied result in partial or complete loss of function (Guida et al. , 2001; Wappl et al. , 2002). It remains to be established why this disorder is paroxysmal and whether the impaired Ca ++ channel function causes ataxia via a direct effect on cerebellar neurons, or by altering transmitter release. A limitation of the heterologous expression studies reported hitherto is that they have not explored systemat- ically the importance of alternative splicing of the affected channel proteins. Finally, CLCN2 mutations also present a paradox. Of the three reported mutations associated with IGE, two are loss of function while the third appears to increase Cl − flux by shifting the activation threshold for the chan- nel (Haug et al. , 2003). Given that the functions of this channel in setting the Cl − gradient and/or the resting membrane potential of neurons are somewhat mysteri- ous, there is clearly much work to be done to understand this channelopathy. MECHANISMS OF DISEASE: WHAT REMAINS TO BE UNDERSTOOD? The preceding discussion has considered the general principle that seizures and hyperkinetic movement disor- ders result from gain of function mutations of Na + chan- nels and loss of function mutations of K + or glycine or GABA A receptors. It ignores some important principles of brain organization, which greatly complicate the rela- tionship between ion channel function and the function of the brain in situ . These include the trivial fact that opposite consequences may be expected from an alter- ation in ion channel function depending on whether it is principally expressed in an inhibitory neuron or an exci- tatory cell. Moreover, the “safety factor” by which a pop- ulation of neurons tolerates a change in ion channel function may differ. For instance, relatively subtle decreases in Kv7.2/Kv7.3 channel function seem to be sufficient to give rise to neonatal convulsions, and yet functional loss of a GLRA1 allele is without effect. A possible explanation why BFNC is a benign syndrome may simply be that the safety factor increases with age. Further, as hinted previously, compensatory changes in the expression of some ion channel genes may occur. These secondary developmental effects may either mask the effect of the molecular lesion in some brain circuits, or reveal unexpected effects. An overcompensatory increase in homologous currents could explain why non- sense mutations of SCN1A cause SMEI, or reconcile the hypothesis that neurotoxic effects of Ca ++ influx explain cerebellar degeneration in EA2 with the evidence that CACNA1A mutations result in loss of function. Ultimately, these complications call for physiological studies of neuronal circuits in situ . Because human tissue is generally inaccessible, several animal models may pro- vide some answers. The best is the knock-in mouse, where the native channel gene has been substituted with a gene (human or murine ortholog) harboring the dis- ease-associated mutation. As mentioned previously, het- erozygous mice expressing an EA1-associated mutation of Kv1.1 reproduce some but not all features of the human disorder: impaired motor coordination, but only after isoprenaline injection, and the animals do not obviously have neuromyotonia (Herson et al. , 2003). Nevertheless, these mice do allow examination of candi- date neuronal circuits that are involved in ataxia. The fre- quency of spontaneous GABAergic synaptic currents in Purkinje cells was found to be higher than in wild-type littermates, implying that a defective “brake” on GABAergic inhibition in the cerebellar cortex may be involved in the ataxia. However, much work remains to be done to find an explanation for the initiation of paroxysms in patients affected by this disorder. Other potentially useful models are transgenic mice over- expressing mutant channels or mice in which the native channel has been disrupted (to mimic a nonsense mutation). Finally, a variety of spontaneous mouse mutants have been identified where the ortholog is affected, generally by muta- tions different from those occurring in humans. Some of these mutants reproduce the human disorder quite well, but some unexpected results call for caution in relying on such models. Thus, for instance, in contrast to homozygous human nonsense mutations of GLRA1 (which only result in hyperekplexia but probably a normal life span), a non- sense mutation of the same gene in the mouse leads to death by 3 weeks (Buckwalter et al. , 1994). Another example in which deleting the murine gene appears to have different effects from the human non- sense mutation is CACNA1A, which encodes Ca V 2.1. Although heterozygous patients have episodic ataxia, heterozygous mice are unaffected, although homozygous knock-out mice have severe ataxia and behavioral arrest suggestive of absence seizures (Jun et al. , 1999; Fletcher et al. , 2001). Several spontaneous homozygous murine Inherited Channelopathies of the CNS 299 Ch17.qxd 9/2/04 10:27 AM Page 299"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"strains with spontaneous mutations of the same gene also have the combination of ataxia and behavioral arrest (and associated EEG changes similar to those seen in human absence epilepsy) (Fletcher et al. , 1996; Lorenzon et al. , 1998). This prompts the question whether human absence epilepsy may also be linked to the same gene. Supporting such an association, one de novo nonsense mutation has been identified in a patient affected by a combination of absence epilepsy and EA2 (Jouvenceau et al. , 2001). CHANNELOPATHIES AND THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES The full impact of ion channel mutations for epilepsy and other paroxysmal disorders remains to be deter- mined. Most patients do not show a clear mendelian pat- tern of inheritance, although concordance is elevated among family members for most paroxysmal neurological disorders. Screening of sporadic hemiplegic migraine cases for CACNA1A mutations has revealed coding mutations in a minority of cases (Terwindt et al. , 2002). However, screening patients with SMEI for SCN1A mutations has a relatively high yield (Claes et al. , 2001; Sugawara et al. , 2002). The genetics of idiopathic epilep- sies and migraine are consistent with polygenic mecha- nisms. Subtle effects of sequence variants in promoters or in introns on gene expression or splicing patterns may be insufficient to cause an overt phenotype on their own, but may act in combination with similar phenomena affecting other genes. Clearly, given that ion channel genes play such an important role in monogenic paroxysmal neuro- logical disorders (and indeed account for 10 of 12 mono- genic epilepsies), they are also the best candidate genes for explaining complex inheritance. This is likely to be an active and fruitful field of research in the near future. It is reasonable to speculate that the neuronal circuit alterations that occur in the channelopathies are relevant to common paroxysmal neurological diseases with indis- tinguishable or similar phenotypes. If so, what clues do they provide for new therapeutic avenues? Perhaps disap- pointingly, several of these avenues are already well trod- den as a result of serendipitous or screening-led drug discovery programs. Thus, Na + channels and GABA A receptors are already the targets of several of the most widely used antiepileptic drugs. An interesting coinci- dence is that Kv7.2/Kv7.3 channel function is relatively selectively enhanced by the experimental antiepileptic drug retigabine (Main et al. , 2000; Wickenden et al. , 2000). Although development of this drug appears to have been suspended, it provides a unique opportunity to attempt a pharmacological correction of the decreased M current density thought to underlie BFNC. However, because most affected individuals cease to have seizures after a few weeks of life, treatment is usually not required. A few individuals do continue to have persistent seizures, and it would be interesting to know whether the drug is especially effective in these patients. One in vitro pharmacological study has also suggested that mutations of nicotinic receptor subunits may enhance their sensitivity to carbamazepine (Picard et al. , 1999). However, it is difficult to design an experiment to determine whether this phenomenon explains the effec- tiveness of this drug in treating ADNFLE, let alone other epilepsies. The role of the channel in vivo is still far from understood, and different disease-associated muta- tions have a variety of effects on nicotinic receptor cur- rent density, affinity, and Ca ++ permeability. A poorly understood feature of several neurological channelopathies is that they are responsive to the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide. Although this is especially noticeable for the periodic paral- yses (which are not addressed in this chapter), it is also reported for EA2, and possibly also for FHM and EA1 (Kullmann et al. , 2001). Among possible explanations is that a metabolic acidosis reduces the excitability of neu- ronal circuits. Although carbonic anhydrase inhibitors were at one time commonly prescribed antiepileptic drugs, they have been displaced by drugs thought to target other sys- tems, including Na + channels and GABA A receptors. Nevertheless, inhibition of carbonic anhydrase has been reported to be an important mechanism of action of the new antiepileptic drug topiramate (Dodgson et al. , 2000). The beneficial effect of acetazolamide in some chan- nelopathies has prompted open-label trials in sporadic migraine with and without aura, with some anecdotal reports of success (Haan et al. , 2000). CONCLUSION Although the monogenic channelopathies are likely to remain relatively uncommon, further therapeutic advances in the treatment of common paroxysmal neu- rological diseases may still derive directly or indirectly from this area of research. This progress will depend heavily on establishing whether subtle functional variants of ion channels are risk factors for sporadic epilepsy and related disorders. Moreover, some of the neuronal cir- cuits implicated in the monogenic channelopathies may also be involved in common disorders with similar clini- cal manifestations. In addition, of course, it will be nec- essary to develop more selective drugs. It may ultimately be important to identify agents that discriminate between closely related channels (or even splice variants) that per- form different functions at different sites, such as Ca ++ channels that trigger the release of excitatory or 300 Inherited Channelopathies of the CNS Ch17.qxd 9/2/04 10:27 AM Page 300"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"inhibitory transmitters and also mediate postsynaptic Ca ++ signaling.

Ion channel mutations have been associated with many different skeletal muscle disorders. Periodic paralysis has been linked to mutations in sodium, cal- cium, and potassium channels. Myotonia has been linked to mutations in sodium and chloride channels. Mutations in voltage-gated and ligand-gated calcium channels can cause malignant hyperthermia and central core disease. Finally, congenital myasthenia syndromes can be caused by mutations in the acetylcholine receptor, as well as the voltage-gated sodium channel. These and other disorders that are caused by ion channel defects are often referred to as channelopathies. This chapter examines how dis- ease mutations alter the function of different muscle ion channels and considers how these changes in ion channel properties contribute to the pathophysiological mecha- nisms underlying muscle disorders. Although chan- nelopathies are typically rare, the insights gained from studying these genetic mutations should aid in the devel- opment of better treatments for excitability disorders. ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR MUTATIONS CAN UNDERLIE CONGENITAL MYASTHENIC SYNDROMES The first step in the excitation of muscle fibers is when acetylcholine (ACh) released from the presynaptic nerve terminals diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the muscle sarcolemma, opening an intrinsic ion channel. The AChR ion channel allows sodium along with some calcium ions to flow into the muscle, thereby depolarizing the mem- brane potential, which triggers an action potential in the muscle. Genetic mutations in the AChR have been iden- tified as one of the underlying causes of congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS). This group of disorders typically presents at birth or early childhood and is char- acterized by muscle weakness, often involving cranial muscles, and a fatiguing or decremental response to low- frequency stimulation of the motor nerves. CMS can arise from defects in presynaptic, synaptic, or postsyn- aptic proteins and different syndromes show autosomal or recessive inheritance patterns. The most common cause for postsynaptic CMS is a defect in the AChR. The nico- tinic AChR of skeletal muscle, an integral membrane protein, is perhaps one of the best-characterized ligand- gated ion channels (Corringer et al. , 2000). The AChR has a pentameric structure, with all of the subunits con- tributing to the pore structure. In immature and dener- vated muscle the receptors are formed by two α , one β , one γ and one δ subunits. In mature innervated muscle, the γ is replaced by an ε subunit. This developmental dif- ference seems to have important implications in the molecular pathophysiology of CMS. All of the different AChR subunits show a significant degree of homology and are probably derived from a common ancestor. Each AChR has two ACh binding sites, one formed at the interface between an α and δ subunit and the other by the second α subunit and either the γ or ε subunit. Binding of ACh is believed to produce a conformational change, altering the positions of the M2 domains of each subunit that contributes to the pore, which increases 303 CHAPTER 18 Inherited Channelopathies of Muscle: Implications for Therapy Theodore R.

Several relatively distinct syndromes are caused by mutations in the muscle AChR (Engel et al. , 2003). Slow channel syndrome (SCS) is a rare disorder that is typi- cally associated with progressive muscle atrophy and characteristic repetitive compound muscle action poten- tials that are elicited in response to single stimuli (Engel et al. , 1982). As with most other congenital muscle disor- ders, however, significant clinical variability is observed. At least 16 different missense SCS AChR mutations (involving single-amino acid substitutions) have been identified (Croxen et al. , 1997, 2002; Engel et al. , 1996; Gomez et al. , 2002; Milone et al. , 1997; Ohno et al. , 1995; Sine et al. , 1995; Wang et al. , 1997). SCS usually shows a classic autosomal dominant inheritance pattern; how- ever, some mutations can exhibit variable penetrance, and one SCS mutation showed a recessive inheritance pattern in a family studied by Croxen et al. (2002). SCS AChR mutations have been identified in all of the sub- units of the mature AChR, with eight in the α subunit, five in the ε subunit, three in the β subunit, and one in the δ subunit. Half the mutations occur in the M2 trans- membrane domain that contributes to the pore of the channel. At least two occur at residues that are important for ACh binding ( α G153S and α V156M). All of the mutations associated with SCS are gain-of-function mutations, and in general the SCS mutations result in endplate potentials with slower decay kinetics. Several of the SCS AChR mutations enhance the affinity of the AChR for ACh (Sine et al. , 1995; Wang et al. , 1997). This enhanced affinity results in slower dissociation of ACh and prolonged channel activation as a result of longer episodes of channels reopening (Sine et al. , 1995). Many of the other SCS mutations, especially those in the M2 domain, enhance the gating efficiency of the channel (Engel et al. , 1996; Milone et al. , 1997; Ohno et al. , 1995). Channels with these mutations typically exhibit pro- longed open times and a higher incidence of spontaneous channel openings (Figure 18.1), indicating that the closed-state is destabilized and the open-state is stabilized by the mutations. The changes in gating efficiency and/or ACh affinity seem to play a crucial role in the progressive nature of the disease. The prolonged channel activation associated with these mutations can allow increased cal- cium entry into the muscle, and this is believed to con- tribute to the progressive degeneration of the junctional folds and the increased muscle weakness that occurs in patients with SCS (Croxen et al. , 1997; Engel et al. , 1996). Zhou et al. (1999) found that many of the SCS mutant channels could be abnormally activated by choline, suggesting that serum choline could result in continuous channel activity and thus exacerbate the muscle damage. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which are useful in other types of CMS, are countertherapeutic with SCS, as they can increase the decay of the already prolonged endplate potential. However, the functional characterization of the SCS mutations indicated that AChR blockers might be therapeutically effective (Fukudome et al. , 1998). Some patients treated with quinidine sulfate, a long-lived AChR blocker, exhibited significant clinical improvement (Harper and Engel, 1998). Fluoxetine, another long-lived AChR blocker, also has been used successfully in SCS patients (Harper et al. , 2003). Another approach that might eventually be suc- cessful for the treatment of SCS is the use of RNA inter- ference to silence the expression of mutant AChR sub units (Abdelgany et al. , 2003). Two other types of AChR mutations are also associated with CMS, but these mutations have different functional 304 Inherited Channelopathies of Muscle: Implications for Therapy FIGURE 18.1 Endplate recordings from control muscle and muscle with AChRs containing the CMS α V249F mutation.

One group of mutations, referred to as fast-channel mutations, alter the functional properties of the AChR. The other group is made up of null or low-expressor mutations that significantly reduce or eliminate expression of the mutant subunit. Both of these groups of mutations are associated with recessive CMS disorders with overlapping phenotypes. Some mutations both reduce subunit expression and alter the functional properties of the AChR (Shen et al. , 2002). The fast-channel mutations contribute to fast-channel syndrome (FCS), which is characterized by mild to severe muscular weakness. FCS has some clinical overlap with SCS and autoimmune myasthenia gravis. However, biop- sied muscle from patients with FCS typically shows rap- idly decaying, low-amplitude endplate currents (Ohno et al. , 1996). In contrast to SCS, FCS is not usually asso- ciated with muscle degeneration, but AChR endplate density is usually reduced in FCS (Engel et al. , 1993). FCS shows a recessive inheritance pattern and typically the fast-channel mutation on one allele is accompanied by a null mutation on the second allele. However, indi- viduals with homozygous fast-channel mutations have been identified (Wang et al. , 2000). Approximately 10 dif- ferent FCS mutations have been identified (Engel et al. , 2003; Shen et al. , 2002; Sine et al. , 2002). Mutations have been identified in the α , δ , and ε subunits, and most of these are missense mutations. The main functional con- sequences of the FCS mutations are reduced steady-state affinity for ACh, shorter open times, and reduced fre- quency and duration of channel bursting. The reduced channel activity and smaller endplate currents can directly impair neuromuscular transmission (Ohno et al. , 1996). Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and agents that increase the size or number of the quanta released by nerve impulses have been effective in treating FCS (Shen et al. , 2002, 2003). More than 60 low expressor or null mutations have been identified in AChR subunits (Engel et al. , 2003). These mutations involve missense, frameshift, and splice- site mutations, as well as promoter mutations (Croxen et al. , 1998, 2001; Nichols et al. , 1999; Ohno et al. , 1997). The vast majority of these mutations are in the ε subunit, and it is thought that this is because low levels of expres- sion of the fetal type γ subunit can partially compensate for the loss of ε subunit expression (Croxen et al. , 2001). The primary result of AChR low expressor or null muta- tions is a reduced AChR density, and the clinical pheno- type varies from very mild to very severe (Ealing et al. , 2002; Ohno et al. , 1997; Sieb et al. , 2000). Deficiencies in the AChR endplate density can also result from defects in other proteins that regulate AChR density such as Rapsyn (Ohno et al. , 2002). As with the related FCS, patients with AChR deficiency typically respond to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and agents that increase the size or number of the quanta released by nerve impulses such as 3,4-diaminopyridine. Understanding the molecular pathophysiologies of CMS can enhance our ability to treat these disorders. Even though SCS and FCS are both CMS disorders that result from missense mutations in the same ion channel, the FCS and SCS mutations have different effects on the activity of AchRs; therefore these closely related syn- dromes require distinct therapeutic strategies. LIGAND-GATED CALCIUM CHANNEL MUTATIONS Genetic defects in a different skeletal muscle ligand- gated ion channel, the ryanodine receptor (RyR1), have been shown to be a common cause of malignant hyper- thermia (MH). MH is a potentially fatal disease that pre- disposes patients to muscle rigidity and sudden rises in body temperature after exposure to volatile anesthetics, such as halothane, or depolarizing muscle relaxants, such as succinylcholine (Jurkat-Rott et al. , 2000a). These agents trigger an increase in intracellular calcium in skeletal muscle of patients with MH, which can directly cause the muscle rigidity. Because individuals with MH do not exhibit clinical symptoms unless exposed to triggering agents, it has been difficult to identify individuals that are susceptible to MH. Assessment of the response of biop- sied muscle to halothane or caffeine is an effective diag- nostic tool; hypersensitivity to these agents in vitro correlates well with the patient’s susceptibility to MH (Brandt et al. , 1999), but a noninvasive test for routine diagnosis is not available. It is hoped that a better under- standing of the molecular basis of MH may lead to bet- ter diagnostic tools (Robinson et al. , 2003). MH associated with RyR1 mutations show autosomal dominant inheritance patterns with significant clinical variability, including incomplete penetrance. RyR1, per- haps one of the largest functional proteins, acts as a cal- cium release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle and is formed as a tetramer from four identical 564 kDa subunits. Each human RyR1 subunit is 5032 amino acids long (Zorzato et al. , 1990), with much of the protein comprising a large N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, referred to as the myoplasmic foot. More than 40 different missense mutations and at least one single- amino acid deletion of RyR1 have been identified in patients with MH (Manning et al. , 1998; McCarthy et al. , 2000; McWilliams et al. , 2002; Quane et al. , 1994; Tammaro et al. , 2003; Yang et al. , 2003), and many of the disease mutations are clustered in two r egions of the myoplasmic foot (Figure 18.2). The myoplasmic foot Inherited Channelopathies of Muscle: Implications for Therapy 305 Ch18.qxd 9/2/04 10:31 AM Page 305"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"seems to play a crucial role in coupling voltage-depend- ent gating of L-type calcium channels in the sarcolemma to RyR1 (Proenza et al. , 2002), although this interaction may not be direct and may be mediated by other proteins that bind to RyR1. In the myoplasmic foot 10 mutations have been identified between amino acids 35 and 614, and another 23 mutations have been identified between amino acids 2129 and 2458. It is not entirely clear how mutations in these regions are involved in the abnormal rise in cytoplasmic calcium after exposure to triggering agents, but the myoplasmic foot contains the majority of the ligand binding sites. Dantrolene, a skeletal muscle relaxant that depresses excitation-contraction coupling by suppressing the release of calcium from intracellular stores in muscle, binds specifically to residues 590-609 of RyR1 (Paul-Pletzer et al. , 2002). Dantrolene has been successfully used in treating MH. An additional nine mutations have been identified between amino acids 4643 and 4906 in the C-terminal portion of the protein that forms the transmembrane segments and the ion channel pore. Functional characterization of the different RyR1 mutations has been limited by the intracellular location of the RyR1 channels and the difficulty in obtaining cur- rent recordings from intracellular membranes. However, studies of pigs with MH caused by a mutation that cor- responds to the human MH mutation R614C indicated that this mutation increases RyR1 open times and decreases closed times (Fujii et al. , 1991). This mutation is sufficient to allow clinically relevant levels of halothane to induce a rapid increase in cytoplasmic cal- cium (Otsu et al. , 1994). A study of six different RyR1 human mutations (R163C, G341R, R614C, V2168M, R2458H, and T4826I) caused similar changes in the functional properties of RyR1 channels expressed in dys- pedic myotubes (Yang et al. , 2003). All of these muta- tions increased the sensitivity of the myotubes to potassium depolarization-induced calcium release by a similar amount when compared to wild-type RyR1 chan- nels, suggesting that MH RyR1 mutations might alter the interaction between RyR1 and voltage-gated L-type cal- cium channels. In addition, despite being located in dif- ferent regions of the channel sequence, all of these mutations increased the sensitivity to caffeine and reduced the inhibition of RyR1 channels by calcium and magnesium, suggesting that a reduction in negative feed- back control of RyR1 might contribute to the clinical phenotype of MH. Thus the MH RyR1 mutations seem to have similar effects on the functional properties of the RyR1 channels. As with other genetic muscle disorders, however, there is significant heterogeneity in the MH clinical phenotype. Yang et al. (2003) reported significant differences in the magnitude of the effects that the differ- ent mutations had on RyR1 function, and these differ- ence could contribute to the interfamilial heterogeneity. However, intrafamilial heter ogeneity suggests that envi- ronmental and/or genetic modifiers also contribute to the clinical phenotype of MH (Robinson et al. , 2000). Mutations in the RyR1 channel have also been identi- fied in patients with central core disease (CCD). CCD is a rare myopathy that typically shows an autosomal-dom- inant inheritance pattern (Shy and Magee, 1956). Affected individuals present with proximal muscle weak- ness and hypertonia in infancy. Although the clinical severity of CCD is highly variable, CCD usually is not progressive. As many as 20 different mutations in RyR1 have been linked to CCD ( Davis et al. , 2003; McCarthy et al. , 2000). Some of the MH RyR1 mutations also cause CCD in some, but not all, individuals (Robinson et al. , 2002). Although the CCD-associated RyR1 muta- tions have been found in all three of the hotspot regions of the RyR1 sequence described for the MH mutations, mutations in the third region, which comprises the trans- membrane and pore segments of the channel, are more likely to be associated with CCD (Davis et al. , 2003; Monnier et al. , 2001; Tilgen et al. , 2001). Two distinct mechanisms have been proposed to explain how the RyR1 mutations lead to CCD (Dirksen and Avila, 2002). Some mutations, including those that also cause MH, seem to result in leaky RyR1 channels that allow the sarcoplasmic reticulum to lose calcium. This depletion of the intracellular calcium stores can impair excitation-contraction coupling and thus con- tribute to muscle weakness. Although many of the RyR1 mutations involve single amino acid substitutions, some 306 Inherited Channelopathies of Muscle: Implications for Therapy FIGURE 18.2 Diagrammatic representation of the RyR1 structure showing the locations of mutations associated with MH and CCD. MH mutations tend to be located in two regions in the large myoplasmic foot, and CCD mutations are predominantly found in the C-terminal region associated with the transmembrane segments and channel pore. Ch18.qxd 9/2/04 10:31 AM Page 306"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"of the patients with CCD have deletions in region 3 of RyR1 that cause the channels to become leaky (Avila and Dirksen, 2001; Zorzato et al. , 2003). More recently a sec- ond mechanism for CCD has been proposed. A set of CCD mutations in region 3 of RyR1 have been identified that do not reduce the calcium content of the sarcoplas- mic reticulum, but instead seem to disrupt voltage-gated calcium release, thus effectively uncoupling excitation- contraction coupling (Avila et al. , 2001, 2003). In some families, CCD inheritance shows an autosomal-recessive pattern (Romero et al. , 2003). In two families this involved compound heterozygous mutations. In one family, the R614C mutation, which is classically associated with a strict MH phenotype, was identified on one allele, whereas a novel G215E mutation was identified on the other allele in two affected family members. It is not clear how these two distinct RyR1 mutations might interact to cause CCD. VOLTAGE-GATED CALCIUM CHANNEL MUTATIONS A mutation in the voltage-gated L-type calcium chan- nel of skeletal muscle has also been linked to MH. The L-type calcium channel, also known as the dihydropyridine receptor, is a heteroligomeric complex, but the main functional subunit is the α 1 subunit, which forms the channel pore and contains the voltage sensors (Catterall, 2000a). All of the different voltage-gated calcium chan- nel α 1 subunits have the same basic overall structure, with 24 putative transmembrane segments arranged in four pseudosubunits or domains. Each domain consists of six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) and the SS1-SS2 regions that form the channel pore. The S4 segment of each domain is thought to be involved in voltage sensing and activation gating. The α 1 subunit of the skeletal mus- cle voltage-gated L-type calcium channel is encoded by the CACNL1A3 gene (Hogan et al. , 1994). An arginine to histidine substitution (R1086H) in the cytoplasmic loop-linking domains III and IV of CACNL1A3 has been associated with MH (Monnier et al. , 1997). This cytoplasmic linker may play a role in binding to RyR1 (Leong and MacLennan, 1998); therefore this mutation may directly impact excitation-contraction coupling and intracellular calcium release. It is predicted that this mutation would lead to an increase in calcium influx through the L-type calcium channel or alter the coupling of L-type calcium channel and the ryanodine receptor only in the presence of MH triggering agents; however, this has not been established in experimental systems. Three other missense mutations in CACNL1A3 (Jurkat-Rott et al. , 1994; Lehmann-Horn et al. , 1995; Ptacek et al. , 1994) have been identified as causing hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP). Individuals with HypoPP experience episodes of muscle weakness that are often associated with a low serum potassium level. Lowered extracellular potassium has the paradox- ical effect of depolarizing the membrane potential of muscle from HypoPP individuals. The muscle weakness, which can last many hours and often occurs in the morn- ing, typically affects the limbs, but facial and respiratory muscle weakness can also occur. Although the CACNL1A3 mutations show an autosomal-dominant mode of inheritance, significant interfamilial and intrafamilial variability is observed (Elbaz et al. , 1995). For example, the R528H mutation is associated with a mild phenotype, with reduced penetrance in both males and females in some families (Sillen et al. , 1997), whereas in other families, complete penetrance is observed with a severe clinical prognosis (Caciotti et al. , 2003). This suggests the presence of important genetic or environ- mental modifiers that affect the severity of the disease phenotype. The three CACNL1A3 missense HypoPP mutations all involve altering a positively charged residue in the S4 subunits of domain II (R528H) and domain IV (R1239H/G). Although these mutations are located in the voltage sensing segments, the predominant effect appears to be a reduction of current density. Changes in cytoplasmic calcium levels play a crucial role in muscle contraction, but it is not clear how a reduction of cal- cium current could underlie the sporadic episodes of muscle paralysis or the paradoxical depolarizing effect of lowered extracellular potassium on muscle membrane potential that is characteristic of HypoPP. Some studies have reported small shifts in the voltage-dependence of activation and/or steady-state inactivation with the CACNL1A3 HypoPP mutations (Jurkat-Rott et al. , 1998; Morrill and Cannon, 1999), although the R528H mutation shifts activation in the negative direction and the R1239H and R1239G mutations shift activation in the positive direction. In addition to functioning as a calcium channel, CACNL1A3 also plays a critical role as a calcium-inde- pendent voltage-sensor in excitation-contraction cou- pling to the ryanodine receptor. Thus it is possible that these mutations affect functional properties that have not yet been identified. It is interesting to note that in patients with the R528H mutation, the reduced excit- ability of the muscle fibers was associated with a signifi- cant reduction in sodium current amplitude (Ruff and Al-Mudallal, 2000). Reductions in inward rectifier potas- sium currents (Ruff, 1999) and adenosine triphosphate potassium currents (Tricarico et al. , 1999) have also been associated with HypoPP associated with calcium channel mutations. These studies indicate that the calcium chan- nel mutations might indirectly cause HypoPP by altering Inherited Channelopathies of Muscle: Implications for Therapy 307 Ch18.qxd 9/2/04 10:31 AM Page 307"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"the properties of other ionic channel and suggest that HypoPP resulting from CACNL1A3 mutations might represent an indirect channelopathy (Ruff, 2000). Although MH and HypoPP are thought to be distinct disorders, several patients with HypoPP, including a patient with the R528H mutation, have been reported to also exhibit MH (Caciotti et al. , 2003; Lambert et al. , 1994; Rajabally and El Lahawi, 2002). PERIODIC PARALYSIS DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH POTASSIUM CHANNEL MUTATIONS Several different potassium channel mutations have been identified as causing periodic paralysis disorders, including Andersen’s syndrome (AS). Individuals with AS exhibit periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, and dysmorphic features (Tawil et al. , 1994). Thus, unlike most of the other skeletal muscle channelopathies, which primarily alter muscle activity, this disorder affects skeletal muscle activity, cardiac muscle activity, and developmental signaling. As with other chan- nelopathies, however, marked clinical variability can be observed, and some family members may exhibit only one or two of the three major clinical characteristics. AS shows an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern, but can also occur sporadically. Periodic paralysis asso- ciated with AS can be hyperkalemic, hypokalemic, or normokalemic (Sansone et al. , 1997) and is present in about two thirds of individuals with AS. Rest after exercise is the most common trigger of attacks and, as with most other forms of periodic paralysis, acetazol- amide can be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of attacks. Because a prolonged QT interval is the most common cardiac abnormality observed in patients with AS, evaluating the consequences of changing serum potassium levels on muscle weakness is not generally recommended with AS. Six missense mutations and two deletion mutations were identified in families or individuals with AS in the initial study, showing that mutations in the inward rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 can cause AS (Plaster et al. 2001). A ninth mutation (R67W) was identified by Andelfinger et al. (2002). In the kindred that this par- ticular mutation was identified, female subjects typi- cally exhibited ventricular arrhythmia (but not prolonged QT intervals) and male subjects exhibited periodic paralysis. None of the family members in this kindred carrying the R67W mutation displayed all three of the classic AS characteristics: 32% displayed two and 20% did not exhibit any. In two unrelated indi- viduals with the R67W mutation, however, the com- plete clinical triad of skeletal muscle, cardiac, and developmental abnormalities was observed. At least 21 different Kir2.1 mutations have now been associated with AS. Mutations have been identified in the C (13/21) and N (4/21) termini, as well as the pore loop (3/21), but only one mutation ( ∆ 95-98) has been identi- fied in a transmembrane domain. Roughly half of the mutations affect residues that are important to the bind- ing of phosphatidylinosital-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) by Kir2.1 (Ai et al. , 2002; Donaldson et al. , 2003; Lopes et al. , 2002). PIP 2 binding by Kir2.1 is critical for the expression of functional currents (Soom et al. , 2001). All of the Kir2.1 AS mutations characterized to date seem to completely eliminate current expression when the mutant channels are expressed alone in heterologous expression systems. However, inward rectifier potassium channels are tetramers formed with four subunits. When expressed with wild-type Kir2.1 channels, different AS mutants resulted in different magnitudes of current reduction (Figure 18.3). With some mutants it appeared that one mutant subunit was sufficient to eliminate current expression, indicating a dominant negative effect of the mutation, whereas with others the reduction showed varying degrees of severity (Plaster et al. , 2001; Andelfinger et al. , 2002; Ai et al. , 2002; Tristani-Firouzi et al. , 2002; Lange et al. , 2003). However, Tristani- Firouzi et al. (2002) were unable to find a correlation between the degree of dominant-negative suppression that a particular mutation exerted and the clinical sever- ity of AS for subjects expressing Kir2.1 mutations. Kir2.1 channels are predominantly expressed in heart, muscle, and brain tissue, where they contribute to setting and stabilizing the resting membrane potential and regulating cell excitability (Jan and Jan, 1997). Blocking inward rectifier potassium currents in skeletal muscle can significantly depolarize the muscle fibers, thereby leading to inactivation of skeletal muscle sodium channels and contributing to muscle inexcitabil- ity and paralysis. The possibility that mutant Kir2.1 sub- units form heteromultimers with Kir2.2 and Kir2.3 subunits (Preisig-Muller et al. , 2002) makes it difficult to fully predict the impact of the AS mutants on excitabil- ity. Kir2.1 mutations appear to account for about two thirds of the individuals with AS. It is not clear what causes the remaining occurrences. Mutations in a subunit of a different type of potas- sium channel have also been associated with periodic paralysis. A mutation (R83H) in the gene (KCNE1) cod- ing for the potassium channel accessory subunit MiRP2 was identified in several individuals with periodic paral- ysis (Abbott et al. , 2001). Paralysis was associated with rest after exercise and a low serum potassium level in one affected individual, but with normal potassium levels and sleep for an unrelated individual with the same MiRP2 mutation. Myotonia has not been observed in individuals with this mutation.

Abbott et al. found that wild-type MiRP2 associated with and altered the properties of Kv3.4 potassium channels, which generate a slowly inactivating voltage gated potassium current in skeletal muscle. The R83H mutation reduced the current density produced by MiRP2-Kv3.4 channel complexes and the R83H-MiRP2 mutant depolarized C2C12 muscle cell resting mem- brane potential by more than 10 mV. Thus, as with the AS Kir2.1 mutations, it appears that the R83H-MiRP2 mutation contributes to paralysis by depolarizing the muscle membrane potential, leading to sodium channel inactivation and muscle inexcitability. MYOTONIA CONGENITA IS CAUSED BY MUTATIONS IN THE VOLTAGE-GATED CHLORIDE CHANNEL Voltage gated chloride channels also play an impor- tant role in regulating the membrane potential of muscle. More than 65 different mutations in the ClC-1 chloride channel, which is predominantly expressed in skeletal mus- cle, have been identified in patients with congenital myotonia. Two forms of general myotonia congenita (GMC) are associated with chloride channel mutations, an autosomal dominant form (Thomsen’s disease) and a recessive form (Becker’s disease) (George et al. , 1993, 1994; Heine et al. , 1994; Koch et al. , 1992). Both forms exhibit a similar phenotype, in which myotonia (muscle stiffness) can often be triggered by exercise after a period of rest. Muscle fibers from affected individuals are hyper- excitable, may exhibit higher input resistances, depolar- ized resting membrane potentials, and reduced chloride conductances. At least 41 different missense mutations, 16 nonsense mutations, and 9 splice mutations have been identified (see Pusch, 2002); and the majority of these myotonia-causing ClC-1 mutations show an autosomal- recessive inheritance pattern. Only about half of the ClC-1 mutations have been functionally characterized in heterologous expression systems, and many of the mutant channels that have been studied do not produce functional currents. It is important to understand the stoichiometry and structure-function relationships of ClC-1 channels in order to understand how different mutations might con- tribute to the clinical phenotype and the inheritance pat- terns observed with GMC.

Ch18.qxd 9/2/04 10:31 AM Page 309"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"channels have been identified in mammals, and these voltage-gated chloride channels have a different structure from other voltage-gated ion channels. ClC channels are homodimers, but each ClC subunit in the homodimer forms a distinct ion conducting pathway, giving the chan- nels a double-barreled structure (Ludewig et al. , 1996). The two separate ClC-1 ion pores seem to have separate fast gates that control their activity independently (Figure 18.4). These fast gates increase the probability of channel openings with depolarization on a millisecond or sub-millisecond time scale. In ClC-0 channels (cloned from the electric organ of Torpedo mamorata ), it was found that in addition to the fast gate there was also a slow gate that affected the activity of both conduction pathways in a coordinated manner. The slow gate of ClC-0 channels decreases the probability of channel opening with depolarization on the time course of sec- onds to minutes. ClC-1 channels also seem to have a common slow gate that affects the activity of both con- ductance pathways in parallel; however, the slow gate of ClC-1 operates on a millisecond to tens of milliseconds time scale, and the slow gate of ClC-1 closes at hyperpo- larized potentials (Accardi and Pusch, 2000). Saviane et al. (1999) proposed that mutations that altered the common slow gate might be more likely to be associated with the dominant form of GMC, whereas those that affect the fast gate or the conductance of individual sub- units might be more likely to be associated with the reces- sive form. Although the activity of ClC channels is voltage-dependent, the mechanism by which voltage gates ClC channels is rather different, in that there is no obvious voltage-sensing structure in ClC channels that is analogous to the S4 segments of the voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and calcium channels. Chloride, the permeating anion in ClC channels, itself is thought to play a crucial role in the voltage-dependent gating of ClC channels. Thus mutations that affect residues that line the pore of ClC-1 can affect permeation, gating, or both (Fahlke et al. , 1997; Zhang et al. 2000b). ClC-1 GMC mutations have been reported to induce a depolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of opening, increase the cation permeability, and even invert the voltage-depend- ence of ClC-1 gating so that channels act as rectifiers (Fahlke et al. , 1995, 1997; Pusch et al. , 1995; Wollnik et al. , 1997; Zhang et al. , 2000a). Most of the mutant channels either eliminate or drastically decrease the chlo- ride conductance at voltages near typical muscle resting membrane potential when expressed alone. When expressed with wild-type ClC-1 channels, however, some mutants exert a dominant negative effect, whereas with others, normal currents are recorded (Steinmeyer et al. , 1994; Kubisch et al. , 1998). For example, Kubisch et al. (1998) found that several mutations identified in patients with dominant GMC imparted a depolarizing voltage- shift on the gating of mutant-wild-type heteromeric channels while two mutations identified in patients with recessive GMC had little or no effect on the currents recorded from cells coexpressing wild-type channels (Figure 18.4). Although this might explain why some mutations are associated with a dominant inheritance pattern and others with a recessive inheritance pattern, it does not explain why several GMC ClC-1 mutations show mixed dominant/recessive patterns (Koty et al. , 1996; Plassart-Schiess et al. , 1998; Zhang et al. , 1996). However, several studies have indicated that a greater than 50% reduction in the chloride conductance of skele- tal muscle is required to produce myotonia, and thus genetic or environmental factors that modulate the expression of ClC-1 channels could determine whether a particular mutation can have a dominant effect (Meyer- Kleine et al. , 1995). Because the myotonia associated with GMC ClC-1 mutations is clearly associated with a reduced chloride conductance, which leads to membrane depolarization, therapeutic strategies targeted at increasing the chloride conductance in muscle cells might be the most direct approach. Currently there are no specific activators of ClC-1 channels; however, the recent crystal structure of the bacterial ClC homolog (Dutzler et al. , 2002) may pro- vide clues regarding how to design specific activators (Estevez et al. , 2003). Functional RNA repair using a trans-splicing ribozyme have also shown some success in vitro (Rogers et al. , 2002). GMC is usually not a major problem for many patients, and symptoms can be con- trolled using drugs, such as mexiletine, that reduce sodium channel activity. However, some studies have indicated that in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), which is caused by a CTG expansion in the gene for dys- trophia myotonica protein kinase, loss of chloride cur- rent as a result of aberrant splicing of the ClC-1 pre-mRNA increases membrane hyperexcitability; thus reduced chloride channel expression may play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of DM1 (Charlet et al. , 2002; Mankodi et al. , 2002). Treatments that increase the activ- ity and expression of ClC-1 channels could benefit other more common muscular disorders. VOLTAGE-GATED SODIUM CHANNEL MUTATIONS Voltage-gated sodium channels underlie the rapid upstroke of the action potential in skeletal muscle and are crucial to muscle excitability. The first skeletal muscle ion channel mutations to be associated with a human disease were hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP) mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (Lehmann- Horn et al. , 1987; Ptacek et al. , 1991; Rojas et al. , 1991). 310 Inherited Channelopathies of Muscle: Implications for Therapy Ch18.qxd 9/2/04 10:31 AM Page 310"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"Since then more than 30 different mutations in the skele- tal muscle sodium channel (Nav1.4) have been linked to autosomal-dominant inherited disorders in humans. The primary functional unit of the fast-activating, fast-inacti- vating sodium channel is a 220-260kD polypeptide α subunit, which has the same basic structure as the volt- age-gated calcium channel α 1 subunit (Catterall, 2000b). The SS1-SS2 regions of each of the four domains form the channel pore, the S4 region of each domain is thought to be involved in activation gating, and the cyto- plasmic linker between domains III and IV is believed to be important in fast inactivation. Although mutations have been identified in all four of the domains, almost half of the mutations identified are in domain 4 and only two mutations have been identified in domain 1 (Figure 18.5A). The majority of mutations are in transmembrane segments, with the most of the remainder occurring in cytoplasmic loops. Only one mutation has been identified in an extracellular loop, and none have been identified in the pore segments or the N and C termini. Nav1.4 mutations have been identified in patients with HyperPP, HypoPP, paramyotonia congenital (PMC), and potassium-aggravated myotonia (PAM). HyperPP is associated with attacks of generalized weak- ness that can be provoked by potassium loading or rest- ing after exercise. The attacks of weakness are usually mild but can last several hours. Many patients with HyperPP also exhibit myotonia. With PMC paradoxical myotonia that is worsened rather than reduced with warm-up is the characteristic symptom. In patients with PMC cold can exacerbate or trigger episodes of myoto- nia and sometimes attacks of weakness. Individuals with PAM exhibit myotonia that can be induced by potassium loading but not by cold and do not experi- ence attacks of weakness. However it is often difficult to classify a patient with a distinct disorder because of clinical variability and overlapping symptoms. For example, patients with the T704M mutation, one of the most common Nav1.4 mutations, have been diagnosed as having classic HyperPP as well as a mixed HyperPP/ PMC phenotype (Brancati et al. , 2003; Feero et al. , 1993; Ptacek et al. , 1991). As with other disease-associ- ated channel mutations, significant intrafamilial and interfamilial variability has been reported for patients with sodium channel mutations (Plassart et al. , 1994), indicating that other genetic and/or environmental fac- tors can affect the clinical phenotype. Almost all of the Nav1.4 mutations associated with human disease have been studied using recombinant channels in heterologous expression systems. Initial studies were done using Nav1.4 cloned from rat (Trimmer et al. , 1989), but many of the more recent studies have been done with the human Nav1.4 clone (George et al. , 1992). Channels have been expressed and characterized in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cell lines by many different groups. Studies have examined a range of different aspects of channel gating. However, it can be difficult to compare the effects of different muta- tions on channel properties because of the use of differ- ent protocols, as well as different expression systems. Initial studies with rat Nav1.4 channels suggested that HyperPP mutations were associated with an increase in persistent noninactivating sodium currents (Cannon and Strittmatter, 1993). Typically Nav1.4 currents inac- tivate completely within several milliseconds, but Cannon and Strittmatter reported that rat channels con- taining mutations corresponding to the human T704M and M1592V mutations continued to allow sodium cur- rent to flow even after tens of milliseconds. Computer simulations and pharmacological studies showed that enhanced persistent sodium currents could indeed lead to the development of hyperexcitability and inexcitabil- ity (Cannon and Corey, 1993; Cannon et al. , 1993) depending on the conditions. However, although the development of persistent sodium currents resulting from impaired fast inactivation may underlie myotonia and paralysis, other mechanisms have also been pro- posed. Another early study using the rat Nav1.4 channel to study the effects of the T704M mutation reported that this mutation shifted the voltage dependence of activation in the negative direction (Cummins et al. , 1993). It was proposed that this shift in activation could lead to a lowered threshold for action potential genera- tion, which could support myotonic activity. The shift in activation could also lead to enhanced window currents, which are persistent currents that occur in a limited volt- age range and arise from overlaps in the voltage depend- ence of activation and fast inactivation. Subsequent studies of the T704M and M1592V mutations in the human Nav1.4 channels showed that both of these HyperPP mutations shift activation in the negative direction by 5 to 12 mV (Bendahhou et al. , 1999b; Rojas et al. , 1999; Yang et al. , 1994), but that neither impaired fast inactivation.

Fast gates act independently to control the activity of two distinct ionic pathways. A common slow gate controls the activity of the two ionic pathways simultaneously.

Furthermore, while enhanced persistent currents, either as a result of impaired fast inactivation or enhanced activation and the develop- ment of window currents, are probably sufficient to induce muscle depolarization and paralysis, it is believed that they are not sufficient to account for the prolonged paralysis that can last several hours in patients with HyperPP. Ruff (1994) proposed that HyperPP sodium channel mutations must also impair sodium channel slow inactivation, a distinct inactivation process that occurs on the order of seconds to minutes, or muscle function would recover relatively quickly. Subsequent studies of slow inactivation clearly demonstrated that slow inactivation was indeed severely impaired by sev- eral of the mutations associated with HyperPP (Cummins and Sigworth, 1996; Hayward et al. , 1997). The L689I, I693T, T704M, and M1592V mutations, all of which have been associated with HyperPP or a mixed HyperPP/PMC phenotype in which the predominant symptom is episodic weakness and myotonia is absent or rare, impair slow inactivation and shift the voltage dependence of activation in the negative direction (Figure 18.5B) (Bendahhou et al. , 1999b, 2002; Hayward et al. , 1999). However, other HyperPP muta- tions do not follow this pattern. The A1156T mutation, which is associated with a mixed HyperPP/PMC pheno- type with frequent myotonic discharges, did not alter either slow inactivation or activation, but slowed the rate of fast inactivation (Hayward et al. , 1999; Yang et al. , 1994). The I1495F mutation, which is associated with a HyperPP phenotype without evidence of myotonic discharge, shifted activation in the negative direction, but enhanced both fast and slow inactivation (Bendahhou et al. , 1999b). Clearly not all HyperPP mutations have the same functional consequences on sodium channel gating, despite contributing to similar clinical phenotypes. Many, but not all, of the PMC Nav1.4 mutations have been characterized. Six of these mutations (T1313M, L1433R, R1448C/H/P/S) have similar effects on Nav1.4 properties to the A1156T mutation (Bendahhou et al. , 1999a; Chahine et al. , 1994; Lerche et al. , 1996; Yang et al. , 1994). These mutations all decrease the rate of fast inactivation and increase the rate of recovery from inac- tivation. However, they have mixed effects on the volt- age-dependence of fast inactivation, with some causing positive shifts and others negative shifts. The direction of the shift may influence the clinical phenotype, as muta- tions that cause negative shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation are more likely to be identified in PMC patients that experience episodes of weakness (Lerche et al. , 1996). None of the PMC mutations are known to affect slow inactivation, and none of them significantly alter activation, but several have been shown to signifi- cantly slow deactivation (the rate at which opened chan- nels return to the closed state during repolarizations) (Richmond et al. , 1997a, 1997b). The combination of slowed inactivation and slowed deactivation is thought to be crucial to the development of myotonic activity and may play a role in the cold sensitivity of PMC (Featherstone et al., 1998). The increased rate of recov- ery from inactivation, which can allow more rapid repet- itive firing of action potentials, is also likely to contribute to muscle hyperexcitability. The M1360V mutation, which is associated with a mixed HyperPP/PMC phenotype, also decreased the rate of fast inactivation and increased the rate of recovery from inactivation but did not alter slow inactivation (Hayward et al. , 1997; Wagner et al. , 1997). Thus many PMC mutations exhibit similar functional defects in het- erologous expression systems. The exception is the V1293I mutation, which shifts the voltage dependence of activation in the negative direction but does not signifi- cantly alter fast or slow inactivation (Green et al. , 1998). Only one report indicates that a PMC mutation enhances persistent sodium currents (T1313M, Hayward et al., 1996), and other studies of this mutation have not confirmed this finding (Yang et al. , 1994). Eight PAM mutations have been described (L266V, V445M, S804F, I1160V, G1306A/V/E, and V1589M). Many, but not all, of these mutations slow the rate of fast inactivation and many, but not all, enhance the rate of recovery from inactivation (Green et al. , 1998; Mitrovic et al. , 1994, 1995; Wang et al. , 1999; Wu et al. , 2001). With the exception of G1306E, these mutations do not significantly alter the voltage dependence of activation, but four of five mutations tested slowed the rate of deac- tivation. Five of the eight mutations shifted the voltage dependence of fast inactivation in the positive direction, but none of the mutations have been reported to impair slow inactivation (although two may enhance slow inac- tivation) (Hayward et al. , 1996; Takahashi and Cannon, 1999). Thus PAM mutations have similar functional con- sequences to PMC mutations. However, at least four of the PAM mutations seem to increase the size of persist- ent currents by roughly threefold. None of the Nav1.4 mutations seem to endow intrinsic potassium sensitivity to the sodium channels, and it is now believed that the effect of potassium on muscle activity is indirect. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis has also been linked to Nav1.4 mutations in some patients (Bulman et al. , 1999; Sternberg et al. , 2001). Four different mutations at two nearby residues have been identified. Although these all involve the neutralization of a charge in one of the 312 Inherited Channelopathies of Muscle: Implications for Therapy Ch18.qxd 9/2/04 10:31 AM Page 312"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"putative voltage-sensors of the sodium channel, little effect is seen on activation. These mutations seem to either enhance fast inactivation (Jurkat-Rott et al. , 2000b), enhance slow inactivation (Struyk et al. , 2000), or enhance both (Bendahhou et al. , 2001). While the majority of Nav1.4 disease-causing mutations involve a gain of function (enhanced activation or impaired inacti- vation), the HypoPP mutations reduce the availability of sodium channels at depolarized potentials. Thus in indi- viduals with HypoPP membrane depolarization causes paralysis by triggering sodium channel inactivation. The selective enhancement of inactivation explains why mem- brane hyperexcitability and myotonia are not associated with HypoPP. Thus a reduced sodium current density is a common feature of HypoPP. However, as with the cal- cium channel HypoPP mutations, it is not clear why hypokalemia paradoxically depolarizes the muscle fibers in patients with these mutations. Finally, a skeletal muscle sodium channel mutation has been implicated in CMS (Tsujino et al. , 2003). The V1442E mutation, the only Nav1.4 mutation identified in an extracellular loop, markedly enhanced the rate of fast Inherited Channelopathies of Muscle: Implications for Therapy 313 FIGURE 18.5 Mutations in Na v 1.4 are associated with several muscle disorders.

By contrast to the other Nav1.4 mutations, which do not seem to affect the respiratory muscles despite that fact that Nav1.4 is the predominant sodium channel in respi- ratory muscles, the patient with the V1442E mutation did exhibit significant episodes of respiratory paralysis in addition to the paralysis of other muscles. The V1442E mutation had a significantly greater effect on reducing sodium channel availability than the HypoPP mutations; therefore action potential generation could fail in muscle from the affected patient, even at normal membrane rest- ing potential. However, as with many of the other Nav1.4 mutations, acetazolamide has been beneficial in prevent- ing attacks of muscle paralysis in the patient with the V1442E. All of the Nav1.4 sodium channel mutations reported to date in humans involve single amino acid substitutions rather than truncation or deletion of parts of the chan- nel. None of the mutations that have been tested have eliminated the expression of functional currents, although a myriad of effects on channel properties have been reported. It has been difficult to study the effects of these mutants in native muscle cells; therefore it is not always clear if the profiles generated in heterologous expression systems are accurate representations of the consequences of these mutations in native tissue. However, these studies suggest that treatments that enhance the rate of sodium channel inactivation might be effective for treating PAM and PMC, and treatments that enhance slow inactivation or shift the voltage dependence of acti- vation might be effective in treating some patients with HyperPP. CONCLUSIONS More than 250 distinct mutations that contribute to congenital muscle disorders have been identified in seven different muscle ion channels. The muscle disorders caused by ion channel mutations typically show signifi- cant variability in the phenotypic expression of the asso- ciated disease, often showing intrafamilial and interfamilial variability. A specific ion channel mutation can contribute to what appear to be two distinct disor- ders (such as CCD and MH) or exhibit different patterns of inheritance (dominant or recessive) in different fami- lies. Thus it is clear that genetic and environmental mod- ifiers play important roles in determining the clinical phenotype. Many of the ion channel mutations are asso- ciated with a gain of function but others cause a loss of function. Some, such as the calcium channel mutations, which may cause HypoPP by reducing sodium and potassium current densities, may represent indirect chan- nelopathies. Some of the inherited muscle disorders, such as the myotonic sodium channel disorders, are treated by agents that largely target symptoms but not the cause of the disease, but others such as MH caused by RyR1 mutations can be treated by agents that specifically target the defective molecule. Understanding the molecular pathophysiology that underlies different skeletal muscle channelopathies is aiding the development of rational therapies for these disorders and could help develop strategies for the treatment of related disorders of excitability.

Targeting these molecules with appropriate chemical entities or biological therapies can alter disease-producing pathways in ways that are clinically helpful. Because ion channels play important roles in the nervous system, it is not surprising that they have emerged as important molecular targets and that the channelopathies, that is, disorders in which abnormal function of ion channels results in clinical signs and symptoms (Figure 19.1), are of major interest to neurotherapeutics investigators. Before the past several years, attention focused on sev- eral broad groups of channelopathies. In the genetic chan- nelopathies , channel protein structure is altered so that channels fail to function or function abnormally as a result of mutations of ion channel genes (Rose and Griggs, 2001). Examples are provided by GEFS + 2 (Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus, Type 2), which is caused by a mutation of the Na v 1.1 sodium channel (Escayg et al., 2000), and by mutations of the Na v 1.2 sodium channel, which can produce epilepsy in animal models (Kearney et al., 2001) and in humans (Sugawara et al., 2001). Another example is provided by familial hemiplegic migraine, which is associated with mutations of the CACNA1A calcium channel gene (Ophoff et al., 1996). In contrast to the genetic channelopathies, which are inherited, some channelopathies are acquired. The acquired channelopathies include the autoimmune and toxic channelopathies in which channel function is per- turbed by antibodies or toxins. One particularly well- studied autoimmune channelopathy is the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome in which antibodies against presyn- aptic calcium channels interfere with transmitter release at the neuromuscular junction (Newsom-Davis, 1997). Another example of an autoimmune channelopathy is provided by Rasmussen’s encephalitis in which autoanti- bodies bind to glutamate receptors and affect their func- tion in neurotransmission (Gahring and Rogers, 1998). An example of a toxic channelopathy is provided by poison- ing with ciguatoxin, which activates sodium channels, causing spontaneous repetitive firing, synaptic fatigue, and swelling of axons and nerve terminals (Benoit et al., 1996). Recent studies have provided evidence for the existence of yet another group of channelopathies, which have been termed the transcriptional channelopathies (Waxman, 2001). In these disorders, there is dysregulated production of an aberrant repertoire of channels whose protein struc- ture is not abnormal , due to changes in the transcription of (non-mutated) channel genes; and the altered ensemble of channels (which are not mutated or affected by antibod- ies or toxins) perturbs neuronal function. Recognition of the transcriptional channelopathies has focused attention on aberrantly expressed channels as molecular targets in neurological disease and has identified new therapeutic opportunities. In this chapter we will discuss several examples of transcriptional channelopathies involving the nervous system (peripheral nerve injury and periph- eral neuropathies, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis), as well as changes in channel transcription within neurons in diabetes, the functional implications of which (adaptive vs maladaptive) are still being studied. SODIUM CHANNEL GENE TRANSCRIPTION: A DYNAMIC PROCESS Recognition that dysregulated expression of ion chan- nel genes can produce neurological disorders has been propelled by identification and characterization of the 319 CHAPTER 19 Transcriptional Channelopathies of the Nervous System: New Targets for Molecular Medicine Stephen G. Waxman, MD, PhD Ch19.qxd 9/1/04 6:46 AM Page 319"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"channel genes and gene products, and by the discovery that the transcription of ion channel genes is a complex and dynamic process. Voltage-gated sodium channels are among the most completely studied channels in this respect and thus will be used as examples in this chapter. Neurophysiological doctrine has traditionally referred to the sodium channel as if it were a singular entity. An additional layer of complexity has been added, however, by analysis at the molecular level, which has shown that at least nine different genes encode distinct voltage-gated sodium channels with a common overall structural motif but with different amino acid sequences (Catterall, 1992; Plummer and Meisler, 1999; Goldin et al., 2000). The functional properties of most of these channels have now been studied, and it has become apparent that dif- ferent sodium channels can exhibit different voltage- dependencies, activation and inactivation kinetics, and recovery properties. Not surprisingly, the selective expression of different ensembles of sodium channels contributes to the different functional characteristics of different types of neurons. Properties as fundamental for neuronal function as threshold, refractory period, and the temporal patterning of action potentials are all affected by the type(s) of sodium channels that are expressed within a given neuron (Waxman, 2000). It is thus not unexpected that changes in sodium channel transcription can have significant effects on neuronal function. The transcription of sodium channels within neurons is not a static process. On the contrary, it is dynamic. Levels of transcription for some sodium channels (e.g., Na v 1.6) increase during the course of development of some types of neurons, while transcription of others (e.g., Na v 1.3) decreases (Beckh et al., 1989; Brysch et al., 1991; Felts et al., 1997). Multiple factors appear to par- ticipate in the regulation of channel transcription, trans- lation, and deployment. Neurotrophic factors exert a complex set of effects on channel expression. For exam- ple, both nerve growth factor (Black et al., 1997; Dib- Hajj et al., 1998; Fjell et al., 1999a; Cummins et al., 2000) and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (Cummins et al., 2000; Fjell et al., 1999b; Boucher et al., 2000) up-regulate transcription of the Na v 1.8 and Na v 1.9 sodium channel genes, while down-regulating transcrip- tion of the Na v 1.3 gene in spinal sensory neurons. Electrical activity may also modulate the transcription of sodium channels within myocytes (Offord and Catterall, 1989) and neurons (Sashihara et al., 1996; Sashihara et al., 1997; Klein et al., 2003). There are also strong reg- ulatory controls on post-transcriptional aspects of sodium channel expression. For example, an oligodendro- cyte-derived soluble factor contributes to the regulation of clustering of Na v 1.2 channels along axons (Kaplan et al., 2001), while myelination is necessary for Na v 1.6 clustering (Boiko et al., 2001; Kaplan et al., 2001). Plasticity in the transcription of ion channel genes within the uninjured nervous system is not limited to development. The dynamic nature of ion channel gene expression in the normal adult brain is illustrated by the magnocellular neurons within the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus. These neurosecretory neurons func- tion as part of an osmoregulatory system that controls thirst, diuresis, and other aspects of water balance. They are relatively quiescent in their basal state, firing irregu- larly at low frequencies (<3 impulses per second). But when there are increases in the osmolarity of extracellu- lar milieu, these neurons convert to a bursting mode in which they generate high-frequency bursts of action potentials that trigger the release of vasopressin from their terminals within the pituitary gland (Andrew and Dudek, 1983; Inenaga et al., 1993; Li and Hatton, 1996). The two modes of operation of supraoptic magnocel- lular neurons (quiescent and bursting), and the ability to drive them from one state to another by noninvasive maneuvers such as oral salt-loading, which results in a 320 Transcriptional Channelopathies of the Nervous System FIGURE 19.1 The channelopathies occur as a result of several types of molecular pathology. Genetic chan- nelopathies are the result of mutations in the genes encoding channel proteins. In the autoimmune and toxic channelopathies , the binding of autoantibodies or toxins to channels alters their function. Transcriptional chan- nelopathies are the result of dysregulated expression of non-mutated genes, which results in the production of an abnormal repertoire of channels whose protein structure is not abnormal. Ch19.qxd 9/1/04 6:46 AM Page 320"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"change in brain osmolarity, made them a useful model system in which to ask: when a neuron converts from a quiescent to a bursting state, does it merely use its (pre- existing) ion channels differently, or is there a change in ion channel expression? To answer this question, Tanaka et al. (1999) used in situ hybridization, immunocytochem- istry, and patch clamp methods to examine the expression of various sodium channel subtypes in these neurons in control rats and following salt loading. Their in situ hybridization results clearly showed that, in association with the transition of the magnocellular neurons to the bursting state, transcription of mRNA for the Na v 1.2 and Na v 1.6 sodium channels (but not for Na v 1.1 or Na v 1.3) is up-regulated. Immunocytochemical studies showed that the increase in mRNA was accompanied by an increase in channel protein. Moreover, patch clamp recordings showed that the newly produced channels had been inserted into the neuronal cell membrane and were func- tional. The amplitudes of both fast, transient currents (which are produced by both Na v 1.2 and Na v 1.6 and which underlie the depolarizing upstroke of the action potential) and persistent currents (which are produced by Na v 1.6 and can be activated by small depolarizations close to resting potential, thus contributing to the lower- ing of threshold for action potential generation) are increased (Tanaka et al., 1999). Thus these neurons rebuild their cell membranes, increasing their electro- genicity, in association with the transition to the bursting state. The molecular remodeling of these neurons within the normal nervous system provides an example of adap- tive plasticity via the production and deployment of a new repertoire of ion channels, which retunes these cells and converts them to a different functional state. Considering the dynamic nature of channel expres- sion in the normal nervous system, it is not surprising that pathological events can trigger changes in ion chan- nel gene expression within neurons. Changes in channel expression within the injured nervous system can be adaptive (see Craner et al., 2003a), but this is not always the case. We now discuss three examples of changes in the transcription of sodium channel genes within the injured nervous system which appear to be maladaptive , that is, the channelopathies associated with peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis (MS). We also discuss changes in sodium channel expres- sion whose adaptive/maladaptive consequences are not yet fully understood, within the magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamus in untreated diabetes mellitus. PERIPHERAL NERVE INJURY Growing evidence from animal models and humans indicates that changes in sodium channel transcription can occur as a result of peripheral nerve injury, and sug- gests that altered sodium channel expression can con- tribute to clinically significant phenomena including paraesthesia and neuropathic pain. Paresthesia and neu- ropathic pain arise, in part, from abnormal firing of injured axons and the spinal sensory neurons (dorsal root ganglion or DRG neurons) from which they arise (Devor and Seltzer, 1999; Zhang et al., 1997; Wood and Perl, 1999). Even before the use of patch clamp recording for the study of neuropathic pain, electrophysiological stud- ies using sharp microelectrodes suggested that abnormal activity of sodium channels can contribute to the hyper- excitability of injured afferents (Kocsis and Waxman, 1983; Kocsis et al., 1983). The intra-axonal recording in Figure 19.2A, from a previously transected, long-term regenerated axon in rat sciatic nerve, illustrates the ten- dency for injured axons to produce aberrant repetitive action potential activity which is not seen in uninjured axons. The bursting activity is abnormal in itself since healthy axons do not respond in this way. In addition, it Transcriptional Channelopathies of the Nervous System 321 FIGURE 19.2 Primary spinal sensory (dorsal root ganglion; DRG) neurons and their axons can become hyperexcitable after nerve injury. A: Intra-axonal recording showing repetitive action potential activity in a previously transected, regenerating axon from rat sciatic nerve (1 year post-crush), following block of potassium channels with 4-aminopyridine.

The burst and under- lying depolarization have an envelope similar to the paroxysmal depolarizing shift seen in epileptic neurons, but are generated along an injured axon trunk where synaptic activity is absent. The configuration of the burst and depolarization were interpreted in early studies as suggesting a contribution of kinetically slow or persistent sodium channels, not seen in normal axons, to firing in injured axons (Kocsis et al., 1983). However, observation of this abnormal mode of electrogenesis in injured axons did not distinguish whether it was the result of a differ- ent mode of function of pre-existing ion channels or of the activity of newly expressed channels. Moreover, the early intracellular recordings could not provide informa- tion about the molecular identity of the channels that were involved. Recent studies at the molecular level have provided answers to these questions. These studies have used patch clamp and molecular methods to demonstrate that nerve injury does, in fact, trigger dysregulation of sodium channel gene transcription and have provided insights into the molecular identity of the channels. The changes triggered by nerve injury include the turning-off of expression of some previously active sodium channel genes, and the turning-on (or turning-up) of expression of another sodium channel gene that is normally rela- tively quiescent in spinal sensory neurons. Figure 19.3 shows that gene expression for the tetrodotoxin (TTX)- resistant sodium channels Na v 1.8 (SNS) and Na v 1.9 (NaN) is down-regulated within primary spinal sensory neurons following transection of their peripheral axons by nerve injury (Dib-Hajj et al., 1996). In parallel with this transcriptional change, as shown in Figure 19.4A and B, the currents produced by Na v 1.8 and Na v 1.9 channels within these neurons are attenuated (Sleeper et al., 2000). Changes in expression of Na v 1.9 may be especially important because Na v 1.9 produces a persist- ent current (Cummins et al., 1999), which contributes to the setting of resting potential (Herzog et al., 2001) and threshold (Baker et al., 2003), and amplifies small depo- larizing inputs such as generator potentials (Herzog et al., 2001; Baker et al., 2003). In contrast to Na v 1.8 and Na v 1.9, which are down- regulated, transcription of the Na v 1.3 (type III) sodium channel gene is up-regulated in axotomized DRG neu- rons (Dib-Hajj et al., 1996; Sleeper et al., 2000; Waxman et al., 1994). The newly formed Na v 1.3 mRNA is trans- lated so that Na v 1.3 sodium channel protein, which is not detectable in uninjured spinal sensory neurons or their axons, is produced and is deployed to distal parts of tran- sected axons (Figure 19.5), which are sites of abnormal impulse generation within neuromas (Black et al., 1999a). Concomitant with the up-regulation of Na v 1.3 expression, patch-clamp studies show the emergence of a new sodium current, characterized by rapid repriming (i.e., rapid recovery from inactivation) within the axot- omized neurons (Cummins and Waxman, 1997) (Figure 19.4C–E). Confirmation that Na v 1.3 channels produce at least a significant part of this current has been pro- vided by patch clamp recordings on heterologously expressed Na v 1.3 channels, and on Na v 1.3 channels experimentally expressed in DRG neurons (Cummins et al., 2001). The accelerated repriming of the inappro- priately expressed Na v 1.3 channels produces a decrease in refractory period which leads to high frequency action potential activity, thus contributing to hyperex- citability of DRG neurons following nerve injury (Cummins and Waxman, 1997). Although the factor(s) that trigger changes in sodium channel expression after nerve injury are not entirely understood, several lines of evidence point to loss of access to peripheral pools of neurotrophic factors includ- ing NGF and GDNF as contributing factors: i) DRG neurons respond differently to axonal transection within peripheral nerves (which project to target tissues that produce neurotrophins), compared to transection within dorsal roots (which project to the spinal cord). Up- regulated transcription of Na v 1.3 (Black et al., 1999a) and down-regulated transcription of Na v 1.8 and Na v 1.9 (Sleeper et al., 2000) are seen following transection of the peripherally directed branch of DRG neurons within the sciatic nerve, but not after central axotomy within the dorsal root. ii) Experimental delivery of NGF (Dib- Hajj et al., 1998) and GDNF (Cummins et al., 2000) to peripherally axotomized DRG neurons up-regulates Na v 1.8 and Na v 1.9 mRNA and protein, as well as the sodium currents that are produced by these channels. These neurotrophic factors also down-regulate Na v 1.3 expression in spinal sensory neurons (Black et al., 1997; Boucher et al., 2000; Cummins et al., 2001; Leffler et al., 2002). iii) NGF deprivation reduces Na v 1.8 transcription in DRG neurons of adult rats in vivo ( Fjell et al., 1999a), a finding that explains the critical role of NGF in the phenotypic maintenance (i.e., maintenance of appropri- ate physiological properties) of these neurons (Lewin et al., 1992; Ritter and Mendell, 1992). Taken together, these observations indicate that changes in sodium channel transcription following nerve injury are at least partly due to a loss of access to peripheral sources of neurotrophic factors. Experimental evidence for behavioral consequences of these changes has been provided by observations, in experimental nerve injury models in rats, that allodynia and hyperalgesia are associated with similar changes in transcription of the Na v 1.8 (down-regulated), Na v 1.9 (down-regulated), and Na v 1.3 (up-regulated) sodium channel genes and in the currents produced by these 322 Transcriptional Channelopathies of the Nervous System Ch19.qxd 9/1/04 6:46 AM Page 322"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"channels (Dib Hajj et al., 1999). Intrathecal delivery of GDNF (which, as described previously, plays a role in the regulation of Na v 1.3, Na v 1.8, and Na v 1.9 expression in spinal sensory neurons) partially reverses the down- regulation of Na v 1.8 and Na v 1.9 mRNA, and up- regulation of Na v 1.3 mRNA in a rodent model of chronic neuropathic pain (Boucher et al., 2000). Accompanying its down-regulating effect on levels of Na v 1.3 mRNA, intrathecally administered GDNF also reverses the acceleration of repriming of sodium cur- rents in axotomized DRG neurons (Leffler et al., 2002) and has been reported to prevent and reverse sensory abnormalities in rodent neuropathic pain models (Boucher et al., 2000). These results demonstrate, in experimental models, that nerve injury—in part by inter- rupting access to peripheral pools of trophic factors— can produce changes in the pattern of sodium channel gene transcription in DRG neurons that alter the excitability of these cells, and indicate that these changes in channel gene expression and the resultant changes in neuronal activity participate in the generation of neuro- pathic pain.

Allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia develop within weeks following the onset of hyperglycemia in rats with experimental (streptozotocin [STZ]-induced) diabetes mellitus. In situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry demonstrate that, in association with painful STZ- induced diabetic neuropathy, there is a significant up- regulation of mRNA and protein for the Na v 1.3, Na v 1.6, and Na v 1.9 sodium channels and a down-regulation of Na v 1.8 mRNA and protein (Craner et al., 2002). The changes in expression of Na v 1.9 are especially interesting because they include injury-induced expression in non- nociceptive cells that normally do not express this chan- nel. In the uninjured nervous system Na v 1.9 is expressed preferentially within pain-signaling DRG neurons (Black and Waxman, 2002; Fang et al., 2002). In rats with exper- imental painful diabetic neuropathy, there is up-regulation of Na v 1.9 mRNA and protein not only in C-type DRG neurons, but also in larger DRG neurons (Craner et al., 2002). There is evidence for sprouting after nerve injury of non-nociceptive myelinated (A β afferent) fibers onto dorsal horn neurons that normally would receive exclu- sively A δ and C-nociceptive projections (Woolf et al., 1992; Kohama et al., 2000) and for a role of increased responsiveness of A δ fibers (Field et al., 1999; Ahlgren et al., 1992) and A β fibers (Campbell et al., 1988) in the generation of dysesthesia and pain after nerve injury. Craner et al. (2002) have suggested that up-regulation of Na v 1.3, Na v 1.6, and Na v 1.9 within C-type DRG neurons may contribute to hyperexcitability of these cells, and 324 Transcriptional Channelopathies of the Nervous System FIGURE 19.4 Changes in the number of functional channels within the neuronal cell membrane are reflected by changes in amplitudes of the c urrents produced by Na v 1.8, Na v 1.9, and Na v 1.3 channels following transection of the axons of DRG neurons within the sciatic nerve.

Although less well studied, there is evidence for a transcriptional channelopathy in human nerve injury. Figure 19.2B shows an intra-axonal recording from an axon within a sural nerve biopsy from a patient who was referred for evaluation because of a painful peripheral neuropathy (Kocsis and Waxman, 1987). Axons in this nerve displayed abnormal spontaneous activity as well as inappropriate bursting in response to brief stimuli, with repetitive firing arising from a slow depolarization that is not present in normal human nerve fibers. By analogy to the studies on experimentally injured nerves described above, it would be predicted that this is due to dysregula- tion of sodium channel expression. Recent immunocyto- chemical studies have in fact provided evidence for abnormal expression patterns of Na v 1.8 and Na v 1.9 sodium channel proteins, consistent with the altered transcription observed in animal models, in DRG neu- rons from patients with nerve injuries and neuropathic pain (Coward et al., 2000). . Taken together, the results from human tissue as well as animal models provide evidence that indicates that axonal injury can trigger dysregulated expression of sodium channel genes. Abnormally expressed channels including the Na v 1.3 channel, which is sparsely expressed in the normal cen- tral nervous system (CNS), and Na v 1.9 and Na v 1.8, which are preferentially expressed in nociceptors (Akopian et al., 1996; Dib-Hajj et al., 1998; Fang et al., 2002), may represent especially tractable targets for pain therapies. SPINAL CORD INJURY Clinically significant pain is experienced by more than 50% of patients with spinal cord injury and is often refractory, or only partially responsive, to standard clini- cal interventions (Balzy, Park, 1992; Turner et al., 2001). There is thus a need for information about the molecular mechanisms underlying pain after spinal cord injury. Long-lasting central neuropathic pain occurs following experimental contusion spinal cord injury in rodents (Hulsebosch et al., 2000; Lindsey et al., 2000; Hains et al., 2001; Mills et al., 2001) and is associated with hyperex- citability of dorsal horn neurons (Hao et al., 1991; Yezeiersky and Park, 1993; Hains et al., 2003a,b). Because the rapidly repriming Na v 1.3 sodium channel has been indicted as a potential contributor to peripheral neuro- pathic pain, we recently hypothesized that dysregulated expression of Na v 1.3 might contribute to pain following spinal cord injury (Hains et al., 2003c). We tested this hypothesis in rats, which developed mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia by 28 days following contusion spinal cord injury at lower thoracic levels. In situ hybridization demonstrated up-regulated expression of Na v 1.3 mRNA within lumbar spinal cord dorsal horn neurons after spinal cord injury (Figure 19.6A and B), and immunocytochemistry with an isoform-specific anti- body revealed up-regulation of Na v 1.3 protein (Figure 19.6C and D). Na v 1.3 co-localized with the NK1 recep- tor, which is localized within second-order nociceptive neurons within the dorsal horn. While spontaneous background activity rates of dorsal horn neurons were unchanged following spinal cord injury, the majority of multireceptive neurons within the dorsal horn after spinal cord injury were hyperexcitable and fired at sub- stantially increased rates following stimulation compared to uninjured controls. (Figure 19.6E and F) (Hains et al., 2003c). To further examine the role of Na v 1.3 in dorsal horn sensory neuron hyperexcitability and pain following spinal cord injury, we next studied spinal cord–injured rats following intrathecal administration of antisense oligonucleotides that targeted Na v 1.3 (Hains et al., 2003c). As shown in Figure 19.6G and H, the expression of Na v 1.3 mRNA in dorsal horn neurons following spinal cord injury was substantially reduced after 4 days of antisense treatment. Similarly, there was a decrease in the level of Na v 1.3 protein when dorsal horn neurons were treated, after spinal cord injury, with Na v 1.3 anti- sense. (Figure 19.6I and J). Accompanying the knock- down of Na v 1.3 expression, evoked discharge rates in dorsal horn neurons were significantly reduced in spinal cord–injured animals that had received antisense, return- ing to levels close to controls (Figure 19.6K and L). Administration of Na v 1.3 antisense also had a rapid and significant effect on pain-related behavior, reversing the decreases in mechanical and thermal thresholds (Figure 19.7). Moreover, following cessation of antisense admin- istration, Na v 1.3 protein levels and dorsal horn neuron excitability returned to pre-antisense levels, and mechan- ical and thermal thresholds returned to pre-antisense lev- els in spinal cord-injured rats (Figure 19.7), adding additional evidence for a role of Na v 1.3 in pain following spinal cord injury (Hains et al., 2003c). In addition to demonstrating that there are changes in sodium channel expression within neurons following spinal cord injury, these studies establish a link between dysregulated expression of Na v 1.3 within dorsal horn neurons, hyperexcitability of these nociceptive cells, and pain following spinal cord injury.

It is not known, at this time, whether changes in Na v 1.3 expression after spinal cord injury are solely responsible for dorsal horn neuron hyperexcitability, because these neurons express multiple types of sodium channels, and it is possible that changes in the expression of these or other channels contribute to changes in threshold, refractory period, or the ability to generate and conduct high-frequency impulse trains. Irrespective of this, these new results implicate Na v 1.3 as a significant contributor to dorsal horn neuron hyperexcitability and pain following spinal cord injury. MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Recent evidence indicates that, in addition to demyeli- nation and axonal degeneration, a transcriptional chan- nelopathy may also contribute to neuronal dysfunction in MS (Waxman, 2002). Demyelination of an axon might be expected to impose an increased drive on channel expression in the neuronal cell body from which it arises. In healthy myelinated axons, sodium channels are clus- tered within the axon membrane at the node of Ranvier, and only a low density of channels (too low to support secure impulse conduction) is present in the internodal axon membrane beneath the myelin (Waxman, 1977; Ritchie and Rogart, 1977). Conduction block in demyelin- ated axons occurs, in part, because injury to the myelin exposes sodium channel–poor membrane, which imposes a capacitative load, thus draining current from the axon without generating an action potential. Recovery of action potential conduction nonetheless occurs in some chronically demyelinated axons (Bostock and Sears, 1978), and this has been shown to be due to the acquisi- tion of a higher-than-normal density of sodium channels within the bared axon membrane (Foster et al., 1980; England et al., 1991; Felts et al., 1997). Recent studies by Craner et al. (2003a) demonstrate that this adaptive change includes a reversion from expression of Na v 1.6, the major sodium channel at mature nodes of Ranvier (Caldwell et al., 2000) to expression of Na v 1.2, which is the major channel along premyelinated axons (Kaplan et al., 2001; Boiko et al., 2001). The deployment of Na v 1.2 along extensive regions of axons that have been demyelinated is accompanied by up-regulated transcrip- tion of Na v 1.2 mRNA within the neuronal cell bodies, which give rise to these axons (Craner et al., 2003a). This transcriptional change appears to serve an adaptive role, providing a substrate for the continuous conduction of impulses along demyelinated axons.

To deter- mine whether there are changes in sodium channel transcription in inflammatory demyelinating diseases, Black et al. (1999) initially studied the mutant Taiep rat, a model in which myelin initially ensheaths CNS axons in a normal manner but subsequently degenerates due to an abnormality of oligodendrocytes (Duncan et al., 1992). The early studies focused on expression of the Na v 1.8 sodium channel (originally termed SNS, S ensory N euron S pecific), which is normally detectable only in spinal sensory neurons and trigeminal neurons (Akopian et al., 1996; Sangameswaren et al., 1996) because, as described previously, the transcription of Na v 1.8 within these neu- rons changes markedly after axon transection. In situ hybridization showed that, following loss of myelin within the cerebellar white matter of Taiep rats, there was markedly enhanced expression of Na v 1.8 mRNA within Purkinje cells. Immunocytochemical studies of Taiep rats showed that the up-regulation of Na v 1.8 mRNA is accompanied by the production of Na v 1.8 protein in Purkinje cells. In a more recent study, Black et al. (2000) examined the expression of Na v 1.8 in the brains of mice with chronic-relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (CR-EAE), an inflammatory model of MS, and in post- mortem brain tissue from humans with MS. The Biozzi mouse CR-EAE model (Baker et al., 1990) was used because it reproducibly provides lesions within the cerebellum, a characteristic that is not commonly observed in monophasic EAE (Baker et al., 2000). As shown in Figure 19.8A–D, in situ hybridization demon- strated significantly increased expression of Na v 1.8 mRNA within Purkinje cells in CR-EAE. Expression of Na v 1.8 protein within Purkinje cells was also up-regu- lated as shown in Figure 19.8E–G (Black et al., 2000). Up-regulation transcription of Na v 1.8 was not part of a global increase in expression of sodium channels, because expression of Na v 1.9, another TTX-resistant sodium channel that is normally expressed in a preferen- tial pattern, like Na v 1.8, in DRG and trigeminal ganglion neurons, was not up-regulated. The increased expression of Na v 1.8 is not limited to animal models of MS. Study of postmortem brain tissue, obtained from patients with disabling progressive MS with cerebellar deficits on neurological examination, has clearly demonstrated up-regulation of Na v 1.8 mRNA and protein within human Purkinje cells (Figure 19.9) (Black et al., 2000). Taken together, these observations in two animal models of MS, and in humans with MS, show that expression of Na v 1.8 is up-regulated in Purkinje neurons, producing Na v 1.8 sodium channel protein, which is not normally present in these cells. Studies extended the evi- dence for a channelopathy in MS by demonstrating (Figure 19.10) that annexin II/p11 [a protein that binds to the N-terminus of Na v 1.8 and facilitates the insertion of 328 Transcriptional Channelopathies of the Nervous System FIGURE 19.8 Sodium channel Na v 1.8 (originally termed SNS, Sensory Neuron Specific) is abnormally expressed within cerebellar Purkinje neurons in mice with EAE.

Expression of Na v 1.8/SNS and annexin11/p11 is also up-regulated in retinal ganglion cells (which give rise to axons that travel in the optic nerve, a site that is fre- quently affected by MS) in EAE (Craner, Black, and Waxman, unpublished). Nav1.8 protein is not present, however, along the axons of Purkinje cells within the cerebellar white matter (Black and Waxman, unpub- lished) or the axons of retinal ganglion cells within the optic nerve (Craner et al., 2003a). The functional consequences of up-regulated Na v 1.8 transcription and translation have not yet been studied in vivo in patients with MS. One possibility that deserves consideration is that Na v 1.8 up-regulation is an adaptive change, providing a substrate for the restoration of action potential conduction along demyelinated Purkinje cell axons. Renganathan et al. (2001) found that Na v 1.8 channels produce a substantial fraction of the inward current that flows during the upstroke of the action potential in the DRG neurons in which these channels are normally present. Thus, if Na v 1.8 channels were inserted into the demyelinated axon membrane, they might contribute to restoration of action potential con- duction in demyelinated axons. However, Na v 1.8 protein has not been detected along demyelinated Purkinje cell or optic nerve axons, although Na v 1.2 and Na v 1.6 pro- tein can be clearly detected (Craner et al., 2003a). This argues against an adaptive role of Na v 1.8 in restoration of conduction along demyelinated axons. It is more likely that up-regulated expression of Na v 1.8 in EAE and MS is a maladaptive change; that is, represents a transcriptional channelopathy. Sodium channels play a crucial role in electrogenesis within Purkinje cells (Llinas and Sugimori, 1980; Stuart and Hausser, 1994; Raman and Bean, 1997). Mutations of sodium channels that are expressed in Purkinje cells have been shown to produce changes in patterns of impulse generation in these cells, which can result in clinical signs of cerebellar dysfunction such as ataxia (Raman et al., 1997; Kohrman et al., 1996). The physiological signature of Na v 1.8 is unique in that it exhibits depolarized voltage-dependence of inactivation, slow development of inactivation (Akopian et al., 1996; Sangameswaren et al., 2000), and rapid recovery from inactivation (Elliott and Elliott, 1993; Dib-Hajj et al., 1997). As a result of these properties, Na v 1.8 channels are available over a wider range of dynamic activity and membrane potential than other sodium channels (Schild and Kunze, 1997), and cells expressing Na v 1.8 should be more slowly adapting than cells lacking Na v 1.8 (Elliott and Elliott, 1993). Several observations support the prediction that abnormal Na v 1.8 expression in Purkinje cells perturbs the temporal pattern of electrical activity in the cerebel- lum. Renganathan et al., (2001) used voltage-clamp and current clamp recording to examine the pattern of elec- trogenesis in DRG neurons from transgenic Na v 1.8 − / − DRG neurons in which functional Na v 1.8 channels are not present (Akopian et al., 1999), and to compare it with electrogenesis in Na v 1.8 + / + neurons. Renganathan et al. (2001) showed that the presence of Na v 1.8 channels within DRG neurons markedly influences both the con- figuration of the action potentials [a change that can cause activation of N-type channels and thus transmitter release (Scroggs and Fox, 1992) if Na v 1.8 is deployed to axon terminals] and the temporal pattern of firing in response to depolarizing stimuli. Consistent with the sug- gestion that cells expressing Na v 1.8 should be slowly adapting (see previous section), this study demonstrated that Na v 1.8 + / + C-type DRG neurons produce sustained pacemaker-like trains of action potentials in response to depolarizing stimuli, which are not present within Na v 1.8 − / − C-type DRG neurons. Renganathan et al. (2003) used biolistic techniques to transfect Purkinje cells in vitro with Na v 1.8 and stud- ied these cells by patch clamp. Voltage-clamp recording from these cells demonstrated that Na v 1.8 channels can be functionally expressed at physiological levels (with current amplitudes similar to those observed within DRG neurons where Na v 1.8 is normally expressed) within Purkinje cells. Current clamp recordings demon- strated that the expression of Na v 1.8 within Purkinje cells alters the activity of these neurons in three ways: first, by increasing the amplitude and duration of action potentials (compare Figure 19.11B and 19.11A); second, by decreasing the proportion of action potentials that are conglomerate and the number of spikes per conglomer- ate action potential (again, compare Figure 19.11B and 19.11A); and third, by supporting sustained, pacemaker- like impulse trains in response to depolarization, which are not seen in the absence of Na v 1.8 (Figure 19.12). More recently, we studied Purkinje cell firing patterns in mice with CR-EAE (Saab et al., 2004), and observed a reduction in the number of secondary spikes per con- glomerate action potential, and breakdown of the conglomerate action potentials with irregularity of tim- ing of the secondary spikes. We also observed bursts of non-adapting, high-frequency action potentials in Purkinje cells from mice with CR-EAE. These results indicate that the aberrant expression of Na v 1.8 within Purkinje cells distorts their pattern of elec- trical activity, both in vitro and in vivo . This perturbation in Purkinje cell activity should interfere with normal cerebellar functioning.

Most clinical observers regard cerebellar signs in MS as per- sistent (non-remitting) even if developing early in the dis- ease course (see, e.g., Matthews et al., 1991), and this is not readily explained by inflammation or demyelination per se.

(2003c) observed, in a relapsing-remitting model of EAE, that the level of Na v 1.8 expression within Purkinje cells increases pro- gressively and is correlated with the severity of non- remitting (including cerebellar) deficits. In addition, the clinical observation of occasional patients of MS with cerebellar deficits on examination, without apparent cerebellar lesions in neuroimaging, is consistent with the hypothesis that molecular changes, too subtle to be detected by currently available imaging techniques, can contribute to cerebellar dysfunction. Finally, paroxysmal ataxia has been well described in MS and, in many cases, responds to treatment with carbamazepine (Andermann et al., 1959; Espir et al., 1966). The temporal profile of the sudden and brief attacks, which are similar to the paroxysmal episodes that are associated with episodic ataxias, are not easily explained by demyelination or axonal degeneration; and the therapeutic response to car- bamazepine suggests that sodium channels participate in their pathogenesis. Up-regulated expression of Na v 1.8 has, as noted pre- viously, been observed within retinal ganglion neurons in EAE (Craner, Black, and Waxman, unpublished) and, if similar changes occur in MS, may also have clinical con- sequences. As in Purkinje cells, voltage-gated sodium channels contribute significantly to electrogenesis in reti- nal ganglion cells (Lipton and Tauck, 1986; Skaliora et al., 2002). Consistent with an abnormality of retinal neurons, there is evidence for retinal dysfunction in MS, even in patients without a history of optic neuritis (Plant et al., 1986). Study of human retinal tissue will be required to determine whether Na v 1.8 is expressed in retinal ganglion neurons in MS. The hypothesis that Na v 1.8 channels, aberrantly expressed within Purkinje neurons and possibly within retinal ganglion neurons, contribute to symptomatology in MS would be strengthened if it could be shown that Na v 1.8 blocking drugs ameliorate ataxia, other cerebellar abnormalities, and/or visual loss in MS. Na v 1.8-specific channel blocking drugs are not yet available, but this is likely to change since the deployment of Na v 1.8 within nociceptive neurons has made it an attractive molecular target. When Na v 1.8-specific blocking drugs are devel- oped, a next step will be to examine the effect of these drugs on animal models of MS such as EAE and, if indicated, in humans with MS. A CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM CHANNELOPATHY IN DIABETES? The role of the CNS in the pathophysiology of dia- betes remains incompletely understood. There is some evidence suggesting that prolonged elevated levels of vasopressin, which is produced within the magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus, are a risk factor for the development of diabetic nephropathy, which can lead to end-stage renal disease (Bardoux et al., 332 Transcriptional Channelopathies of the Nervous System FIGURE 19.12 Purkinje neurons transfected with Na v 1.8 show sus- tained repetitive firing, not present in the absence of Na v 1.8, on injec- tion of depolarizing current. A: Control Purkinje neuron lacking Na v 1.8 produces a conglomerate action potential consisting of five spikes, but no sustained firing, in response to a sustained depolarizing stimulus (80 pA, 1 second). B: Purkinje neuron expressing Na v 1.8 produces larger-amplitude action potentials and shows sustained pacemaker-like activity in response to identical stimulus. The current pulse protocol is shown in C. Modified from Renganathan et al. (2003). Ch19.qxd 9/1/04 6:46 AM Page 332"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"1999; Ahloulay et al., 1999). As noted previously, vaso- pressin is released as a result of action potential firing by supraoptic magnocellular neurons. Because changes in the transcription of sodium channel genes can be evoked within supraoptic magnocellular neurons by elevations in osmolality within the normal brain (Tanaka et al., 1999), as described at the beginning of this chapter, Klein et al. (2002) recently hypothesized that the hyperosmolality associated with diabetic hyperglycemia can trigger a change in sodium channel expression in these cells. To test this hypothesis, they used in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry, and patch clamp recording to study sodium channel expression within magnocellular neurons from the hypothalamus of rats with STZ- induced diabetes. As shown in Figure 19.13, in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical analysis demon- strated significant up-regulation of Na v 1.2 and Na v 1.6 sodium channel mRNA and protein in the magnocellular neurons within weeks of the development of hyper- glycemia, but there was no change in sodium channel expression within other nearby nuclei or the surrounding neuropil. To determine whether the up-regulated mRNA and protein resulted in the insertion of functional channels within the membranes of magnocellular neu- rons, acutely dissociated magnocellular neurons were studied using patch clamp. Although the voltage- dependence of activation and steady-state inactiva- tion (Figure 19.14) and the time constants for inactivation were similar for diabetic and control neu- rons, the peak transient current amplitude was 130% greater ( P < .001) in diabetic magnocellular neurons; peak current density in diabetic neurons was 65% greater ( P < .05) than that in controls. Persistent sodium cur- rents, which are known to contribute to neuronal burst- ing and are increased in magnocellular neurons exposed to hyperosmolar conditions (Tanaka et al., 1999), were also compared. Tetrodotoxin-sensitive persistent cur- rents that were activated at potentials close to threshold ( − 65 to − 55mV) were significantly larger in diabetic neurons, with a current density that was increased by approximately 50% compared to that in control neurons ( P < .05; Klein et al., 2002). This study demonstrates that, in experimental dia- betes, increased transcription results in an increased den- sity of functional sodium channels within magnocellular neurosecretory neurons of the hypothalamus, a change that will increase excitability of these cells and evoke vasopressin release from them. Because prolonged Transcriptional Channelopathies of the Nervous System 333 FIGURE 19.13 Voltage-gated sodium channel gene expression in hypothalamic magnocelluar neurons is up- regulated in diabetes.

If this speculation is correct, altered sodium channel expression within supraoptic neurons associated with diabetes may be viewed as a channelopathy and may be amenable to ther- apeutic approaches that might delay the development of end-organ complications such as nephropathy. On the other hand, it is possible that the changes are adaptive, contributing to homeostatic mechanisms in untreated or undertreated diabetes. Further study is clearly needed. Irrespective of whether the changes are maladaptive or adaptive, the changes in the diabetic hypothalamus provide another example of the dynamic nature of ion channel expression within the CNS. OTHER CHANNELS? OTHER NEURONS? OTHER TRIGGERS? Transcriptional channelopathies of the nervous sys- tem are a growing group of disorders that includes other classes of channels and other types of neurons. Increased K v 1.1 and K v 1.2 potassium channel (Wang et al., 1999) expression, for example, have been reported along dys- myelinated axons within the brain of the Shiverer mouse, in which myelin fails to compact due to a defect in myelin basic protein. Recent studies provide evidence for the ectopic expression of the α 1B pore-forming subunit of N-type calcium channels within dystrophic (presumably degenerating) axons in EAE and MS (Kornek et al., 2000) and for the presence of mGluR1 α glutamate recep- tor immunoreactivity along axons in MS (Geurts et al., 2003), although it is not clear whether the receptors are inserted into the axon membrane. Immunocytochemical (Ishikawa et al., 1999) and electrophysiological (Everill and Kocsis, 1999) studies have provided evidence for down-regulation of potassium channels and up- regulation of some calcium channels (Baccei and Kocsis, 2000) in axotomized dorsal root ganglion cells. There also is evidence for altered GABA A receptor expression in axotomized DRG neurons (Oyelese and Kocsis, 1996; Oyelese et al., 1997). Although less well studied, there is also evidence sug- gesting that channel transcription may be perturbed in other disorders of the nervous system. It is possible, for example, that transcriptional channelopathies contribute to some types of epilepsy. Increased expression of Na v 1.2 and Na v 1.3 sodium channel mRNA has been observed in rat hippocampus following kainate-induced seizures (Gastaldi et al., 1997); it is not known whether these transcriptional changes, or a change in properties of pre- existing channels, for example, by phosphorylation, pro- duce the increased sodium current density and shifted voltage-dependence that are seen in hippocampal neu- rons after kindling epileptogenesis (Vruegdenhil et al., 1998). At this time it is also not known whether diffuse axonal injury associated with head trauma or corti- cospinal axon transection due to spinal cord injury can trigger changes in ion channel expression, for example, in cortical motor neurons, that might contribute to posttraumatic epilepsy or to loss of these neurons. The factor(s) that provoke dysregulated ion channel in injured neurons need further study. A silencer element (RE1) has been identified within the 5 ′ promoter region of the Na v 1.2 sodium channel gene (Kraner et al., 1992; Mori et al., 1992), and it may play a role in some trans- criptional channelopathies. Whether similar regulatory elements occur within other channel genes is not yet known. There is a need for more information about the effects of changes in electrical activity (Offord and Catterall, 1989; Sashihara et al., 1996; Sashihara et al., 1997; Klein et al., 2003), and in levels of neurotrophic factors (including NGF and GDNF) (Dib-Hajj et al., 1998; Cummins et al., 2000; Toledo-Aral et al., 1995) on channel expression, both in the intact nervous system and after various insults. Inflammation within the termi- nal field of axons is known to result in a change 334 Transcriptional Channelopathies of the Nervous System FIGURE 19.14 Patch clamp recordings of acutely dissociated MNCs from diabetic rats show increased peak and ramp currents ( A , left and right, respectively) and current densities ( B ), indicating that increased numbers of functional sodium channels have been inserted within the membranes of diabetic MNCs; black bars = control, white bars = dia- betic, data plotted as mean ± SE, * = P < .05 by non-paired t-test.

POSSIBLE THERAPEUTIC OPPORTUNITIES With further progress from molecular and physiologi- cal studies in vitro and in vivo, we will undoubtedly learn more about the transcriptional channelopathies. A more complete understanding of these channelopathies may point to new therapeutic strategies, because the unique amino acid sequences of different channels may facilitate specific targeting. The preferential expression of some channels within specific groups of neurons may, moreover, facilitate their manipulation with mini- mal side effects. The transcriptional channelopathies, and the molecular targets they present, may offer new opportunities for treatment of a range of disorders affecting the nervous system.

The broad range of first-line treatments often focusing on antidepressants and opi- oids, and the fact that even the most useful drugs only alleviate pain in a minority of recipients highlight our lack of understanding of these pain syndromes. Fortunately, new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie neuropathic pain are changing this situation. Over the past decade, a number of useful animal models of neuropathic pain have been developed. The ability to manipulate gene expression in transgenic animals and to examine the consequence of gene abla- tion or overexpression in such models has provided a wealth of new potentially interesting drug targets for neuropathic pain. In addition, analysis of the efficacy of drugs in the treatment of neuropathic pain in both ani- mal models and the clinic has suggested new directions for effective drug development. In this chapter we review recent insights into the molecular mechanisms of neuro- pathic pain, focusing on alterations in the excitability of damaged peripheral nerves, and the receptors and regu- latory molecules that underlie this process. THE PROBLEM Neuropathic pain may arise as a consequence of diseases that lead to peripheral nervous system degener- ation such as diabetes, herpes zoster, or acquired immuno- deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Between 2 and 3 million patients in the United States suffer such pain, with many referrals to pain clinics arising from the million people a year in whom herpes zoster, also known as shingles, devel- ops. Post-herpetic neuralgia as a result of permanently damaged nerves develops in approximately 20% of shin- gles sufferers. At least 2% of the Western world is affected by diabetes and 50%, according to some esti- mates, eventually develop diabetic neuropathy. Of the many millions of AIDS patients, at least 10% develop a neuropathic pain syndrome as a result of viral or drug- induced damage to peripheral nerves. Apart from these clinical conditions, peripheral nerve injury as a result of trauma or surgical complications may also lead to neu- ropathic pain state s. Up to 10% of amputees may develop phantom limb pain. Damage to the spinal cord and brain may also lead to chronic central pain states. Chronic pain is, in fact, reported in a majority of patients after spinal cord injury. The substantial figures of neuropathic pain incidence may be an underestimate. For example, US surveys sug- gest that the lifetime incidence of lower back pain (LBP) ranges from 60% to 90% with a 5% annual incidence. No consensus exists concerning the mechanism or most appropriate treatment and management of mechanical LBP. To date there are no comprehensive figures outlin- ing the incidence of various chronic pain syndromes. Approximately 38% of the general population in Denmark suffer from chronic pain (Andersen and Worm-Pedersoen, 1989). Similarly a survey of chronic pain in Sweden found that 45% of all adults have experi- enced recurrent or persistent pain, while 8% endure severe persistent pain (Korff et al., 1990). A telephone survey found that 7% of a large random sample of adults in the United Kingdom were in substantial pain (Bowsher et al., 1991). A more detailed study of chronic pain in the United Kingdom found that 50% of those surveyed reported chronic pain or discomfort, including 16% with back pain and 16% with arthritis. In 16% of those surveyed, chronic pain was severe (Elliott et al., 1999). Because the mechanisms underlying these chronic 339 CHAPTER 20 New Molecular Targets for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain John N. Wood, PhD, ScD Stephen G.

Such pain can have a substantial impact on the qual- ity of life not only of the chronic pain sufferers, but also their families. The consequences of long-term chronic pain are not only physical but may also include social iso- lation, marital breakdown, loss of employment with con- sequent financial difficulties and, unsurprisingly, depression. PRESENT TREATMENTS AND ANIMAL MODELS In a retrospective analysis of placebo-controlled trials, Sindrup and Jensen (1999) extracted the data on the effi- cacy of various drugs in treating neuropathic pain. A useful measure is to estimate the number of patients that need to be treated (NNT) for one person to obtain 50% pain relief. Thus the smaller the number, the more effec- tive the drug treatment. An important caveat in this his- torical survey is that newer drugs such as gabapentin may not have been tested in as much depth as antidepressants that have been known to be useful for some time. In addi- tion, N -methyl- D -aspartate (NMDA) antagonists and a variety of other potentially useful drugs are not included in the study. In diabetic neuropathy, NNT was 2.4 for tri- cyclic antidepressants. The NNT was 6.7 for selective serotonin reuptake inhibi tors; 3.3 for the anti-epileptic carbamazepine; 10.0 for a sodium channel blocker, mex- iletine; 3.7 for gabapentin, which probably targets nocicep- tor Cav2.2 calcium channels; 1.9 for dextromethorphan and 3.4 for tramadol, both opioid-like drugs; and 5.9 for capsaicin, the exogenous activ ator of the TrpV1 noxious heat receptor. In post-herpetic neuralgia, opioids were inactive, but the NNT was similar for other drugs, for example, 2.3 for tricyclic antidepressants, 3.2 for gabapentin, 2.5 for oxy- codone (a weak opioid), and 5.3 for capsaicin. In peripheral nerve injury, NNT was again 2.5 for tri- cyclics and lower (3.5) for capsaicin. In central pain, NNT was 2.5 for tricyclic antidepressants, whereas selec- tive serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mexiletine, and dex- tromethorphan were inactive. These figures are interesting from a variety of perspectives. First, the most effective drugs do not target the site or underlying mech- anism of neuropathic pain development, but rather tar- get the integrative assessment of the pain, and its effect through the use of antidepressants. The distinct patterns of drug efficacy also suggest that different mechanisms may underlie various subtypes of neuropathic pain. Recapitulating the human peripheral nerve injuries that lead to neuropathic pain in animal models has proved extremely useful for mechanistic studies. Usually such models are named after the principal author on the first papers in which these models were described. Most models focus on partial nerve injury to sciatic or sural nerves, which allow altered hind-limb pain sensitivity to thermal and mechanical insults to be measured and com- pared with the uninjured contralateral paw (Figure 20.1). For technical reasons, most groups have focused on neu- ropathic pain models in inbred strains of rat, where the sur- gery is easier and behavioral read-outs are fairly robust. Yoon et al. (1999) investigated the differences between dif- ferent strains of rat in terms of neuropathic pain behavior. Despite very similar normal pain thresholds, neuropathic pain behavior showed major differences between rat strains. After injury produced by tightly ligating the left L5 and L6 spinal nerves, behavioral signs representing mechanical allodynia, cold allodynia, and spontaneous 340 New Molecular Targets for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain Animal Models of Neuropathic Pain Rhizotomy SNL CCI SNI Sural Nerve Tibial Nerve Common Peroneal Nerve Sciatic Nerve Saphenous Nerve Femoral Nerve Axotomy sciatic + saphenous nerve ligation and transection CCI Chronic constriction injury (Bennett 1988) Seltzer Partial ligation of sciatic (Seltzer 1990) Chung Ligation and transection of L5/6 spinal nerves (Kim et al. 1997) SNI Spared nerve injury (Decosterd and Woolf 2000) STZ Streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathy Sciatic axotomy L3 L4 L5 L6 FIGURE 20.1 Ligation and transection of peripheral nerves innervating the hind paw are two of the most com- monly used approaches to modeling neuropathic pain in rodents.

Surprisingly, there were differences even between supposedly identical rat strains from different suppliers, with a relative resistance to neuropathic pain behavior in some rat strains. As transgenic technology has been increasingly applied to studies of pain mechanisms, the emphasis on animal models has switched to the study of mice. Almost all transgenic mice are made using embryonic stem cell lines from 129/Sv mice that are introduced into C57Bl6 moth- ers. The advantage of this approach is that coat color can indicate whether the engineered stem cells have inte- grated into the host to create a chimera. The progeny are thus not inbred. This genetic heterogeneity has had important consequences for analyzing pain phenotypes because, as with the rat, there are dramatic differences in pain behavior between different strains of mice. Mogil et al. (1999) have embarked on a comprehensive analysis of the pain behavior of different mouse strains. Such studies can provide important information about com- mon mechanisms between different types of pain behav- ior, as well as allowing the mapping of candidate genes that may play important roles in pain pathways. These studies also highlight the potential variability in responses between different human populations to pain therapeutics. Mogil et al. tested 11 inbred mouse strains (129/J, A/J, AKR/J, BALB/cJ, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, C58/J, CBA/J, DBA/2J, RIIIS/J, and SM/J) using 12 measures of pain behavior, including thermal nociception (hot plate, Hargreaves’ test, tail withdrawal), mechanical nociception (von Frey filaments), chemical nociception (abdominal constriction, carrageenan, formalin), and neuropathic pain (autotomy, Chung model peripheral nerve injury). Strain differences in the various assays could be as much as 50-fold, emphasizing the importance of appropriate lit- termate controls for the analysis of transgenic mouse pain behavior. The first commonly used model of rodent neuropathic pain (Bennett model of chronic constriction injury, CCI) relied on the tight ligation of the sciatic nerve using thread soaked in chrome alum, which in itself imparted a low pH insult to the local tissue (Bennett et al., 1992). Kim et al. (1997) ligated tightly both L5 and L6 (or L5 alone) spinal nerves (Chung model), and compared the evoked behavior with that found in the Bennett model. Both thermal and mechanical thresholds were affected, with a long-lasting hyperalgesia to noxious heat (at least 5 weeks) and mechanical allodynia (at least 10 weeks) of the affected foot. In addition, there were behavioral signs of the presence of spontaneous pain. The partial nerve injury caused in this model was an important develop- ment in allowing functional changes in both damaged and adjacent neurons to be investigated. In a similar fashion, Seltzer (1990) ligated about half of the sciatic nerve close to the spinal cord. Within a few hours the rats developed guarding and licking behavior of the ipsilat- eral hind paw, suggesting the presence of spontaneous pain. This behavior continued for many months. There was a decrease in the withdrawal thresholds in response to repetitive von Frey hair stimulation at the plantar side. Both allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia were appar- ent in this model, as was thermal hyperalgesia Given the variation in procedures between different laboratories, a useful single laboratory comparison of the characteristics of chronic constriction injury by loose liga- tion of the sciatic nerve, tight ligation of the partial sci- atic nerve (PSL), and tight ligation of spinal nerves (SNL) was made by Kim et al. (1997). All three methods of peripheral nerve injury produced behavioral signs of both ongoing and evoked pain with similar time courses. However, mechanical allodynia was greatest in the SNL injury and smallest in the CCI model. On the other hand, ongoing pain was much more prominent in the CCI model than in the other two. More recently, a further variation on the theme of partial nerve injury has been developed with the spared nerve injury model (SNI) (Decosterd and Woolf, 2000). This involves a lesion of two of the three terminal branches of the sciatic nerve (tibial and common per- oneal nerves) leaving the remaining sural nerve intact. The spared nerve injury model is unique in restricting contact between intact and degenerating axons, and this allows behavioral testing of the non-injured skin territo- ries next to the denervated areas. Erichsen and Blackburn-Munro (2002) investigated the pharmacologi- cal sensitivity of the SNI model to various potential analgesic drugs measuring reflex nociceptive responses to mechanical and cold stimulation after systemic adminis- tration of opioids, sodium channel blockers, and other drugs. They found that morphine attenuated mechanical hypersensitivity in response to von Frey hair and pin- prick stimulation and cold hypersensitivity in response to ethyl chloride. The sodium channel blocker, mexiletine, relieved both cold allodynia and mechanical hyperalge- sia, but the most distinct and prolonged effect was observed on mechanical allodynia. Gabapentin signifi- cantly alleviated mechanical allodynia, but perhaps sur- prisingly had no effect on mechanical hyperalgesia. In contrast, the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 and the AMPA receptor antagonist NS1209 did not provide any relief. The Chung model has also been characterized in terms of responses to different type of analgesic drugs that have some utility in the clinic (Abdi et al., 1998). Amitriptyline (an antidepressant), gabapentin, and lido- caine (a local anesthetic) were effective in increasing the threshold for mechanical allodynia Amitriptyline and lidocaine reduced the rate of continuing discharges of injured afferent fibers, although gabapentin did not New Molecular Targets for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain 341 Ch20.qxd 9/1/04 6:47 AM Page 341"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"influence these discharges, presumably acting centrally. The differences in the pharmacological characteristics of the various animal models of neuropathic pain are likely to reflect different mechanisms that are relevant to human pathophysiology. It is heartening that effective drugs found serendipitously in the clinic (e.g., gabapentin) are effective in animal models, thus validat- ing studies of animal models as relevant to analgesic drug development. CANDIDATE GENES FOR CLINICAL INTERVENTION Classical genetic studies involving mapping of inbred strains of animals are time-consuming. Now that the complete sequence of the mouse and human genomes are available, it is possible to scan essentially all expressed genes in normal and pathophysiological states to try to find candidate transcripts that may be involved in the underlying pathology. Microarray technology now gener- ally uses oligonucleotide arrays of 50 to 60 bases (rather than cDNA copies) immobilized on glass slides, that are hybridized with tagged cDNA copies of RNA extracted from control or experimental samples. Analysis of tripli- cate samples is usually considered necessary to obtain meaningful figures on alterations in transcript levels. A number of limitations to this powerful and expen- sive technology should be borne in mind. First, changes in gene expression of less than twofold are hard to detect. Second, splice variant differences, particularly involving small exon substitutions, may not be detectable with present arrays. In addition, dramatic alterations in mRNA expression in a small subset of neurons may be swamped by background levels of the transcript in other tissues. Perhaps most importantly, transcriptional regula- tion may not be the principal site of gene dysfunction. For example, the redistribution of voltage-gated channels within the membrane of a damaged nerve may produce major excitability changes that are not a consequence of altered transcriptional regulation. There are a number of analyses of altered gene expres- sion patterns characteristic of axotomy in the literature. Wang et al. (2003) found 178 genes to be dysregulated 3 days after axotomy. Using Northern blot analysis, quan- titative slot blots, and in situ hybridization, they con- firmed these data for 83% of the genes. Xiao et al. (2002) carried out a similar analysis 2 weeks after axotomy, and cataloged altered genes into a number of different cate- gories. Costigan et al. (2002) found effects similar to those reported by Wang et al. (2003) with approximately 240 genes dysregulated 3 days after axotomy. This wealth of information brings its own problems. How can one test the significance of these altered levels of expression functionally? The relative merits of antisense, siRNA, and gene deletion technologies for the analysis of these candidate genes are discussed subsequently. RECEPTORS AND CHANNELS IMPLICATED IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF NEUROPATHIC PAIN A combination of gene regulation studies, knockouts, and pharmacological insights have provided us with a range of new targets for neuropathic pain that are cata- loged subsequently. Although a survey of the literature provides an apparently bewildering range of different mechanisms in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain, there are common themes and interrelationships between many of the different deficits cataloged in animal models. First, damage to sensory neurons or their axons can lead to alterations in responses to trophic factors and cytokines (e.g., nerve growth factor [NGF], glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), tumor necrosis factor [TNF]), leading to altered patterns of gene expression (e.g., the re-expression of genes normally expressed in early development such as the sodium channel Na v 1.3). Second, damage to axons leads to altered subcellular patterns of channel expression (voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels) that lead to hyperexcitability or spontaneous electrical activity. Thus large diameter sensory neurons express high levels of the HCN pacemaker channel and become hyperexcitable. This in turn leads to altered pat- terns of input into the dorsal horn involving voltage- gated calcium channel subunits (e.g., α 2 δ -1) and changes in second order sensory neuron synaptic efficacy involv- ing NMDA receptors. Presynaptic or postsynaptic P2X receptors within the dorsal horn also appear to be neces- sary for the establishment of neuropathic pain. The alter- ations in synaptic organization within the dorsal horn are accompanied by local increases in microglia that appear to further potentiate neuropathic pain behavior by the release of soluble factors. Molecular targets that are rea- sonably well established as contributing to neuropathic pain are shown in Table 20.1. Sodium Channels Voltage-gated sodium channels comprise a family of ten structurally related genes that are expressed in spa- tially and temporally distinct patterns in the mammalian nervous system. It has long been known that sodium channel blockers are powerful analgesics when delivered at low concentrations (Strichartz, 2002). Evidence of a role for these channels in neuropathic pain has come from studies of neuronal excitability, analysis of patterns of expression of channel isoforms in animal models of neuropathic pain, and antisense and knockout studies. 342 New Molecular Targets for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain Ch20.qxd 9/1/04 6:47 AM Page 342"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"Two sodium channels, Na v 1.8 and Na v 1.9, are selectively expressed within the peripheral nervous system, predom- inantly in nociceptive sensory neurons, and these partic- ular isoforms have attracted attention as analgesic drug targets. In addition, an embryonic channel Na v 1.3 and a beta subunit, β -3, are up-regulated in DRG neurons in neuropathic pain states. Craner et al. (2002) showed that in experimental dia- betes, there is a significant up-regulation of mRNA and protein for the Na v 1.3, Na v 1.6, and Na v 1.9 sodium chan- nels and a down-regulation of Na v 1.8 mRNA that accom panies allodynia. In most neuropathic pain models exemplified by axotomy, however, Na v 1.8 and 1.9 are down- regulated, while Na v 1.3 is induced (Waxman et al., 1994; Dib-Hajj et al., 1996, 1998; Okuse et al., 1997) (Figure 20.2, Table 20.2). Na v 1.3 is widely expressed in the adult central nervous system (CNS) but is normally absent, or present at low levels, in the adult peripheral nervous system. Axotomy or other forms of nerve damage lead to the re-expression of Na v 1.3 and the associated beta-3 subunit in sensory neurons, but not in primary motor neurons (Waxman et al., 1994; Dib-Hajj et al., 1996; Hains et al., 2002). This event can be reversed in vitro and in vivo by treatment with high levels of exogenous GDNF. Na v 1.3 is known to recover (reprime) rapidly from inactivation (Cummins et al., 2001). Axotomy induces the expression of rapidly repriming tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive sodium channels in damaged neurons, and this event can also be reversed by the combined actions of GDNF and NGF (Leffler et al., 2002). Concomitant with the reversal of Na v 1.3 expression by GFNF, ectopic action potential generation is diminished and thermal and mechanical pain-related behavior in a rat CCI model is reversed (Boucher et al., 2000). Moreover, Na v 1.3 is up-regulated in multireceptive nociceptive dorsal horn neurons following experimental spinal cord injury; this up-regulation is associated with hyperexcitability of these nociceptive neurons and pain; antisense knockdown of Na v 1.3 attenuates the dorsal horn neuron hyperexcitability and the pain behaviors in animals with spinal-cord injury (Hains et al., 2003). It therefore seems likely that Na v 1.3 re-expression plays a significant role in increasing neuronal excitability, thus contributing to neuropathic pain after nerve and spinal cord injury. Na v 1.8 is mainly expressed in nociceptive neurons (Akopian et al., 1996; Djouhri et al., 2003). This channel contributes a majority of the sodium current underlying the depolarizing phase of the action potential in cells in which it is present (Renganathan et al., 2001). Functional expression of the channel is regulated by inflammatory mediators, including NGF (Dib-Hajj et al., 1998b), and both antisense and knockout studies support a role for the channel in contributing to inflammatory pain (Khasar et al., 1998; Akopian et al., 1999). Antisense studies have also suggested a role for this protein in the development of neuropathic pain (Lai et al., 2002), and a deficit in ectopic action propagation has been described in the Na v 1.8 null mutant mouse (Roza et al., 2003). However, neuropathic pain behavior at early time points seems to be normal in the Na v 1.8 null mutant mouse (Kerr et al., 2000).

Na v 1.9 is also expressed selectively in nociceptive neurons (Dib-Hajj et al., 1998a; Fang et al., 2003) and underlies a persistent sodium current with substantial overlap between activation and steady-state inactivation (Cummins et al., 1999) that has a probable role in setting thresholds of activation (Dib-Hajj et al., 2002; Baker et al., 2003), suggesting that blockade of Na v 1.9 might be useful for the treatment of pain. Conversely, it has been suggested that Na v 1.9 activators might alleviate pain because Na v 1.9 is down-regulated after axotomy (Dib- Hajj et al., 1998a; Cummins et al., 2000) and the resul- tant loss of the Na v 1.9 persistent current and its depolarizing influence on resting potential (Cummins et al., 1999) might remove resting inactivation from other sodium channels (Cummins and Waxman, 1997). In the absence of Na v 1.9 null mutants or selective blockers, there is incomplete information on the role of this chan- nel in neuropathic pain, although it is known that normal level of expression seems to be dependent on the supply of NGF or GDNF (Cummins et al., 2000). Present evidence thus makes sodium channels highly attractive analgesic drug targets, but specific antagonists for Na v 1.3, 1.8, and 1.9 have yet to be tested in the clinic. Calcium Channels The evidence of an important role for voltage-gated calcium channels in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain is strong. A variety of drugs targeted at calcium channel subtypes are effective analgesics, and mouse null mutants of N-type Ca v 2.2 calcium channels show dramatic diminution in neuropathic pain behavior in response to both mechanical and thermal stimuli. In addition, two highly effective analgesic drugs used in neuropathic pain conditions selectively target calcium channel subtypes. The conotoxin ziconotide blocks Ca v 2.2 alpha subunits, and the widely prescribed drug gabapentin binds with high affinity to α 2 δ subunits of calcium channels (Figure 20.3). Voltage-gated calcium channels comprise a single alpha subunit and show structural homology with sodium channels, but the accessory subunits associated with these channels are more complex.

Four α 2 δ subunit genes have now been cloned. Message and protein for the α 2 δ -1 subunit is highly expressed in sensory neurons but is also found fairly ubiquitously in other tissues (Gong et al., 2001). The gene structure is similar for all α 2 δ subunits, with 39 exons and a number of splice variants. All α 2 δ subunits have a predicted N terminal signal sequence, indicating that the N terminus is extracellular, with an intracellular C terminus and potential transmembrane region. There are up to 14 conserved cysteines throughout the α 2 δ -1, 2, and 3 sequences, six of which are within δ , providing additional evidence that α 2 and δ are disulfide-bonded. Following the identification of α 2 δ subunits as compo- nents of skeletal muscle calcium channels, they have also been shown to be associated with neuronal N and P/Q type channels. The α 2 δ -1 subunit has been shown to bind to extracellular regions including Domain III on the Ca v 1.2 subunit (Felix et al., 1997).

The α -subunits are now classified using a numerical designation. Ch20.qxd 9/1/04 6:47 AM Page 345"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"α 2 δ -1 subunit. Transient transfection of cells with α 2 δ -1 increased the number of gabapentin binding sites (Gee et al., 1996). Subsequently gabapentin has been found to bind to two isoforms of α 2 δ subunits (the α 2 δ -1 and α 2 δ -2 isoforms, but not α 2 δ -3 or α 2 δ -4) (Gee et al., 1996; Gong et al., 2001). This binding may involve the Cache and other domains (Anantharaman and Aravind, 2000), but it is unknown how gabapentin exerts its action. The effects of gabapentin on native calcium currents are con- troversial, with some but not all authors reporting small inhibitions of calcium currents in different cell types. Gabapentin could interfere with α 2- δ binding to the α 1 subunit, thus destabilizing the heteromeric complex. However, the skeletal muscle calcium channel complex was not affected by gabapentin. Interestingly, α 2 δ -1 up- regulation in neuropathic pain correlates well with gabapentin sensitivity (Luo et al., 2002), suggesting that the α 2 δ -1 isoform is the most likely site of action of gabapentin. The up-regulation of α 2- δ subunits does not occur in all animal models of neuropathic pain that result in allodynia. Luo et al. (2002) compared DRG and spinal cord α 2 δ -1 subunit levels and gabapentin sensitiv- ity in allodynic rats with mechanical nerve injuries (sci- atic nerve chronic constriction injury, spinal nerve transection, or ligation), a metabolic disorder (diabetes), or chemical neuropathy (vincristine neurotoxicity). Allodynia occurred in all types of nerve injury investi- gated, but DRG and/or spinal cord α 2 δ -1 subunit up-reg- ulation and gabapentin sensitivity coexisted only in mechanical and diabetic neuropathies. This may partially explain why gabapentin is ineffective in some patients with neuropathic pain. Further support for calcium channels as useful drug targets in neuropathic pain comes from an analysis of the characteristics of the Ca v 2.2 null mutant mouse gener- ated by Saegusa et al. (2001). The same authors (Saegusa et al., 2002) have compared the Ca v 2.2 and 2.3 null mutants in a variety of pain models. Despite the wide- spread expression of Ca v 2.2, it has proved possible to demonstrate major deficits in inflammatory and in par- ticular neuropathic pain in this transgenic mouse using the Seltzer model. Thermal and mechanical thresholds were dramatically stabilized in this mutant mouse. The relationship between α 2 δ subunits and Ca v 2.2 has not been investigated in detail, so it is possible that gabapentin has sites of action on calcium channels other than Ca v 2.2 . A role for Ca v 2.2 in chronic pain is consistent with a known analgesic role for N-type calcium channel block- ers. Ziconotide, a toxin derived from marine snails, blocks Ca v 2.2 channels with high affinity and has been found to have analgesic actions in animal models and humans. In a study of the antinociceptive properties of ziconotide, morphine, and clonidine in a rat model of postoperative pain, heat hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia were induced in the hind paw (Wang et al., 2000). Intrathecal ziconotide blocked established heat hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent manner and caused a reversible blockade of established mechanical allodynia. Intrathecal ziconotide was found to be more potent, longer acting, and more specific in its actions than intrathecal morphine in this model of postsurgical pain. Brose (1997) provided dramatic evidence of the utility of ziconotide (SNX-111) in the clinic in a case of a patient with 23 years of intractable severe deafferentation pain. Intrathecal ziconotide provided complete pain relief with elimination of hyperesthesia and allodynia in a dose-dependent manner, although side effects were experienced. This type of study has led to clinical use of ziconotide in the treatment of intractable pain in patients with late stage cancer. Recent evidence that omega cono- toxins also target P2X3 receptors (Lalo et al., 2001) sug- gests that ziconotide may act on a broader range of targets than first suspected. Potassium Channels Neuronal excitability is enhanced by lowered levels of functional expression of voltage-gated potassium chan- nels. Evidence has been obtained that potassium channel transcripts are differentially regulated at the transcrip- tional level in animal models of neuropathic pain. Using RT-PCR, Ishikawa et al. (2002) found that, in a chronic constriction injury model of neuropathic pain, K v 1.2, 1.4, 2.2, 4.2, and 4.3 mRNA levels in the ipsilateral DRG were reduced to 63% to 73% of the contralateral sides of the same animal at 3 days and to 34% to 63% at 7 days following CCI. In addition, K v 1.1 mRNA levels declined to approximately 72% of the contralateral level at 7 days. No significant changes in K v 1.5, 1.6, 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.5, and 4.1 mRNA levels were detectable in the ipsilateral DRG at either time. Interestingly, of the K v channels present in DRG, K v 1.4 seems to be the only channel expressed in small diameter sensory neurons, and the expression levels of this channel are much reduced in a Chung model of neuropathic pain (Rasband et al., 1999). Passmore et al. (2003) provided evidence that KCNQ potassium currents (responsible for the M-current) may also play a role in setting pain thresholds. Retigabine potentiates M-currents, and leads to a diminution of nociceptive input into the dorsal horn of the spinal cord in both neuropathic and inflammatory pain models in the rat. Nicotinic and GABA Receptors Rashid and Ueda (2002) found that intrathecal administration of ( − )nicotine and ( + )epibatidine, at doses 346 New Molecular Targets for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain Ch20.qxd 9/1/04 6:47 AM Page 346"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"without undesirable effects, had no antinociceptive action in sham-operated mice but completely reversed thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia in mice with partial sciatic nerve injury. The GABA(A) agonist muscimol (adminis- tered intrathecally) also produced neuropathy-specific analgesic action, giving analgesia only in nerve-injured mice. The GABA(A) antagonists bicuculline and picro- toxin blocked the analgesic effect of muscimol as well as that of nicotine and epibatidine. Thus, neuropathy-spe- cific analgesic actions of nicotinic agonists may be due to stimulation of the GABAergic system whose inhibitory tone had been reduced because of injury. Pacemaker Channels Cyclic nucleotide–regulated hyperpolarization-acti- vated cation channels (HCN channels) play an impor- tant role in cardiac function and are expressed within sensory neurons. Chaplan and collaborators (2003) have described a novel role for HCN channels in touch- related pain and spontaneous neuronal discharge origi- nating in the damaged dorsal root ganglia. Nerve injury markedly increased pacemaker currents in large- diameter dorsal root ganglion neurons and resulted in pacemaker-driven spontaneous action potentials in the ligated nerve. Pharmacological blockade of HCN activ- ity using the specific inhibitor ZD7288 reversed hyper- sensitivity to light touch and decreased the firing frequency of ectopic discharges originating in A- β and A- δ fibers by 90% and 40%. Targeting these channels appears problematic, however, given their other roles in the periphery. NMDA and Glutamate Receptor Systems Glutamate is the principal excitatory signaling mole- cule within the nervous system, and nociceptive input into the spinal cord is down-regulated by molecules such as ketamine that block NMDA receptors. The main problem with targeting the glutamate signaling system is the presence of side effects, because of the global expres- sion of glutamate receptors throughout the nervous sys- tem. However, progress has been made in minimizing side effects by targeting NMDA receptor subtypes to induce analgesia. Conditional knockout of NR1 within dorsal horn reduces injury-induced pain (South et al., 2003). Parsons (2001) focused on the functional inhibi- tion of NMDA receptors that can be achieved through actions on the glycine binding site, the NR2B polyamine site, or the phencyclidine site located inside the NMDA channel. Moderate-affinity channel blockers such as glycine(B) and NR2B selective antagonists show a much better side effect profile in animal models than high- affinity channel blockers or competitive NMDA receptor antagonists. Boyce et al. (1999) found that the NR2B subunit had a restricted distribution in laminas I and II of the dorsal horn, suggesting a presynaptic location on primary afferent fibers. The selective NR2B antagonist CP-101,606 caused no motor impairment or stimulation in rats at doses far in excess of doses inhibiting allodynia in neuropathic rats. NR2B antagonists may therefore have clinical utility for the treatment of neuropathic pain conditions in humans, although the best efforts of the pharmaceutical community have yet to achieve this objective (Figure 20.4).

Prolonged depolarization and glutamate release can lead to activation of NMDA receptors, a specialized coincidence detector for glutamate implicated in alterations in synaptic plasticity. Thus prolonged noxious input into the dorsal horn can lead to central changes in synaptic efficacy that have been implicated in chronic pain. Ch20.qxd 9/1/04 6:47 AM Page 347"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"Malmberg et al. (2003) also exploited the channel blocking properties of conotoxins to compare the anal- gesic effects of conotoxins targeted against the NR2B (Conantokin B) or NR2A and NR2B (Conantokin G) subtypes of the NMDA receptor with the effects of ziconotide in a rat sciatic nerve ligation model. Con-G reversed the allodynia produced by nerve injury, with greater potency on thermal sensitivity than on mechani- cal allodynia. The therapeutic window between analgesic effects and motor impairment was greater for NMDA receptor blockers than ziconotide in these studies. Other components of glutamate signaling including metabotropic receptors and transporters have been implicated in the development of neuropathic pain. Simmons et al. (2002) found that agonists directed at group II mGluR receptors were effective in attenuating neuropathic pain. In the L5/L6 spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain in rats, LY379268 signifi- cantly reversed mechanical allodynia behavior in a dose- related manner but had no significant effects on acute pain tests such as tail flick or paw withdrawal. These results suggest a useful action of selective group II mGluR agonists for the treatment of persistent pain. By contrast, antisense studies suggest that mGluR1 antago- nists may be useful. Fundytus (2001) used antisense oligonucleotides to knock down mGluR1 receptors and found reduced cold hyperalgesia, heat hyperalgesia, and mechanical allodynia in the injured hind paw of neuro- pathic rats. Glutamate transporters play an important role in glu- tamate homeostasis and the suppression of excitotoxic- ity. A differential expression of glutamate transporters in the spinal cord has been described (Sung et al., 2003) in a rat CCI model. Here an initial functional transporter up-regulation up to day 5 within the ipsilateral spinal cord dorsal horn was followed by a down-regulation at days 7 and 14 following nerve injury. The mitogen- activated protein kinase inhibitor PD98059 almost abolished transporter up-regulation with concomitant exacerbated thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allody- nia, although some of these effects are likely to be due to other actions of the map kinase inhibitor. Taken together, plasticity in the glutamate signaling system seems to be central to the development of neuro- pathic pain, but the problems of targeting chronic pain without side effects have yet to be fully resolved. Purinergic Receptors The ATP-gated cation channel P2X3 is relatively specifically expressed by nociceptive neurons, and has been assessed as an analgesic target for antisense studies, the generation of null mutant mice, and the development of specific pharmacological antagonists (North 2003). There appears to be a strong case that this receptor plays a role in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. Barclay et al. (2002) used antisense oligonucleotides administered intrathecally to functionally down-regulate P2X3 recep- tors. After 7 days of treatment, P2X3 protein levels were reduced in the primary afferent terminals in the dorsal horn. After partial sciatic ligation, both inhibition of the development of mechanical hyperalgesia and significant reversal of established hyperalgesia were observed within 2 days of antisense treatment. The time course of the reversal of hyperalgesia was consistent with down- regulation of P2X3 receptor protein and function. Despite these observations there is no evidence that P2X3 receptors are up-regulated in neuropathic pain. There does in fact seem to be down-regulation of P2X3 following L5/L6 spinal nerve ligation in rats (Kage et al., 2002). A significantly reduced number of small diameter neurons exhibited a response to α , β –methyleneATP (a P2X3 selective agonist), but large diameter neurons and some small neurons retained their expression of functional P2X3 receptors (Figure 20.5). TNP-ATP is a potent antagonist of P2X3 receptors but is metabolically unstable and also acts on P2x1-4 subtypes. Nevertheless, TNP-ATP is capable of completely reversing tactile allodynia, albeit in a transient fashion over an hour (Tsuda et al., 1999). More recently a potent stable antago- nist of P2X3 and P2X2/3 heteromultimers has been devel- oped. This compound, A317491 (Jarvis et al., 2002), reverses mechanical allodynia and thermal sensitivity in a rat neuropathic pain model. Interestingly, ziconotide also blocks P2X3 receptors, so some of its analgesic actions may also be mediated through this receptor (Lalo et al., 2001). P2Y receptors may also play a regulatory role in neuropathic pain. Ogada (2003) showed that intrathecal administration of P2Y receptor agonists UTP and UDP produced significant antiallodynic effects in a rat sciatic nerve ligation model. Vanilloid Receptors The polymodal nature of responses to noxious stimuli demonstrated by the capsaicin receptor TrpV1 and the usefulness of capsaicin in treating some chronic pain syn- dromes suggest that members of this receptor class may play a role in chronic pain. There is indeed evidence that TrpV1 is up-regulated in the DRG neurons adjacent to those that have been damaged by spinal nerve ligation (Fukuoka et al., 2002) while being down-regulated in damaged neur ons. The up-regulated TrpV1 expression seems to be associated with A-fiber sensory neurons (Hudson et al., 2001). These new receptors have been sug- gested to be important for the analgesic effects of capsaicin cream (Rashid et al., 2003). There are also claims that TrpV1 antagonists may be useful in treating neuropathic 348 New Molecular Targets for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain Ch20.qxd 9/1/04 6:47 AM Page 348"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"pain. Capsazepine, a non-competitive antagonist of TrpV1, markedly attenuated mechanical hyperalgesia in a guinea pig sciatic nerve injury model (Walker et al., 2003), but this effect was absent in rodents. Thus, a case for an important role of Trp channels in neuropathic pain pathogenesis is missing. However, evidence of a role for TrpV4 in noxious mechano-sensation (Suzuki et al., 2003) may stimulate fur- ther investigation of this class of receptors as pain targets. Cannabinoids Cannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptors both on sensory neu- rons and within the CNS are known to be useful targets for agonists with analgesic activity in neuropathic pain (Fox et al., 1999). In the partial sciatic ligation model of neuropathic pain, CB-selective agonists WIN55,212-2, CP-55,940, and HU-210 produced complete reversal of mechanical hyperalgesia within 3 hours of subcutaneous administration. Zhang et al. (2003) showed that chronic pain models associated with peripheral nerve injury, but not peripheral inflammation, induce CB2 receptor expression in a highly restricted and specific manner within the lumbar spinal cord. The appearance of CB2 expression coincided with the appearance of activated microglia, and it is likely that CB2 agonists may be acting through these immune system cells. Opioids and Other Neuropeptides Conventional opioid drugs have been shown unequiv- ocally to be useful in treating certain neuropathic pain conditions such as diabetic neuropathy (Rowbotham et al., 2003). More controversial is the role of the noci- ceptin/orphanin FQ system in regulating neuropathic pain. Initial reports suggested that nociceptin had anal- gesic effects in neuropathic pain models (Halo et al., 1998). In contrast, Mabuchi et al. (2001) used a noci- ceptin/orphanin FQ antagonist, JTC-801, to demon- strate attenuation of thermal hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain models. Levels of endomorphins, novel opioid ago- nists that act on mu receptors, increase in the periaque- ductal gray matter of rats with sciatic nerve ligation (Sun et al., 2001). The role of these novel opioid ligands in neuropathic pain is thus still unclear. Holmes et al. (2003) provided evidence that overex- pression of galanin attenuated mechanical allodynia compared with controls after nerve damage using a spared nerve-injury model. These results support an inhibitory role for galanin in the modulation of nocicep- tion both in intact animals and in neuropathic pain states. By contrast, NK1 antagonists rather than agonists have some analgesic actions, suggesting that substance P does play a role in neuropathic pain induction. Neurotrophins and Cytokines The breakdown of axonal transport of neurotrophic factors has been associated with some of the alterations in DRG gene expression that are associated with neuro- pathic pain. For example, the sodium channels Na v 1.8 and Na v 1.9 require basal NGF levels for normal patterns of expression (see, for example, Cummins et al., 2000). Counterintuitively, NGF has algogenic activity in neuro- pathic pain. Overexpression of NGF in glia, driven by a GFAP-promoter, caused enhanced ipsilateral responses to thermal and mechanical stimulation following CCI compared to wild-type mice. Following CCI, sympathetic neurons sprouted into ipsilateral and to a lesser extent contralateral DRG with the sprouting much greater in mice than in controls (Ramer et al., 1999).

(2000) found that injecting neutralizing anti-NGF antibodies into injured DRG could lead to significant analgesic effects in terms of mechanical thresholds measured with von Frey hairs. Svensson et al. (2003) extended these observations to the clinic, injecting the human masseter muscle with NGF and evoking a long-lasting mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia in the jaw-closing muscles as measured by pressure pain thresholds and pressure tolerance thresholds. Some of the actions of NGF seem to be affected by downstream release of BDNF. At the molecular level, acting through its high affinity receptor TrkB, BDNF seems to be able to regulate the activity of some ion channels, thus modulating synaptic efficacy. A role for BDNF in regulating pain pathways has long been pro- posed (Thompson et al. , 1999), and pharmacological evi- dence that BDNF can act to regulate NMDA receptor activity important in spinal cord pain pathways has been presented. The evidence of a role for BDNF as a neuro- modulator in the spinal cord includes its presence in vesi- cles in nociceptive fiber terminals, increases in dorsal horn levels of BDNF in inflammatory pain, analgesic effects of Trk-B receptor bodies that are considered to act as scavengers of BDNF released from primary sen- sory neurons, and excitatory effects on dorsal horn neu- rons. BDNF is up-regulated in uninjured DRG neurons in sciatic nerve ligation models (Fukuoka et al. , 2001), but the role of this neurotrophin in neuropathic patho- genesis is uncertain. By contrast, the withdrawal of trophic support by GDNF seems to play an important role in changing pain thresholds. Takahashi et al. (2000) found that behavioral changes in rat neuropathic pain models were accompanied by decreased expression of GDNF in the DRG and the sciatic nerve on the injured side on the fourteenth day after the surgery. Boucher et al. (2000) normalized neuropathic pain behavior in CCI rats by the intrathecal administration of GDNF. Some of these effects may be due to reversing changes in sodium chan- nel expression. Trophic factors of the GDNF family acting through the c-ret famil y of receptor kinases are thus potentially interesting therapeutic agents. Interleukin-6 is another intriguing target. Murphy et al. (1999) showed that in constriction nerve injury, interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA was induced in a subset of rat primary sensory neurons. Mice with null mutations of the IL-6 gene lacked hypersensitivity to cutaneous heat and pressure after CCI injury. Tumor Necrosis Factor TNF is known to alter mechanical but not thermal pain thresholds when applied exogenously to the nerve trunk (Sorkin and Doom, 2000). Transgenic animals overexpressing TNF under the control of a GFAP pro- moter (that would express TNF in Schwann cells and astrocytes) also show greater mechanical allodynia in an L5 transection nerve injury model than control mice (de Leo et al., 2000). In neuropathic pain models such as the sciatic nerve ligation model, the expression of TNF receptors type 1 and 2 is up-regulated in both damaged and uninjured DRG neurons as measured immunocyto- chemically (Schafers et al., 2003). In addition to increased receptor expression, immunoreactive TNF itself is induced. Okamoto (2001) found that gene expres- sion in injured rat sciatic nerve was significantly increased at day 7 for IL-1beta and IL-6 and at day 14 for TNF. A role for TNF is strongly supported by the thera- peutic actions of compounds that block TNF action. Thalidomide blocks the production of TNF by activated macrophages. Sommer et al. (1998) found that in rats pretreated with thalidomide, CCI resulted in diminished mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, although treatment with thalidomide at a time point when hyper- algesia was already present did not alter the course of the pain-related behavior. Similarly, a metalloprotease inhibitor, TAPI, that blocks maturation of TNF (Sommer et al., 1997) leads to a reduction of thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia of up to 50%. Thus, TNF seems to be involved in the early development of neuro- pathic pain, but postinjury block of TNF action does not appear therapeutically useful. PHYSICAL CHANGES IN NEUROPATHIC PAIN STATES Peripheral nerve damage is associated with the inva- sion of damaged tissues and spinal cord by immune sys- tem cells, potential rewiring of central synapses, and altered behavior in supporting glia. Hanani et al. (2002) found that after axotomy, Schwann cells became exten- sively coupled to other Schwann cells that enveloped other neurons, apparently by gap junctions. Such con- nections were absent in control ganglia. The number of gap junctions increased 6.5-fold after axotomy. There is renewed debate about the possibility of cen- tral sprouting after nerve injury within the dorsal horn. Early studies using cholera toxin B as a marker are now suspect because of phenotypic changes in central termi- nals that occur after nerve injury. Bao et al. (2002) showed that after nerve injury, a small number of A-fibers do indeed sprout into inner lamina II, a region normally innervated by C-fibers, but not into outer lamina II or lam- ina I. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) was found in these sprouts in inner lamina II, an area very rich in NPY1 receptor- positive processes. Thus, large NPY immunor eactive DRG 350 New Molecular Targets for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain Ch20.qxd 9/1/04 6:47 AM Page 350"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"neurons sprout into the NPY1 receptor-rich inner lamina II after peripheral nerve damage. We have already seen that CB2 receptor-bearing microglia invade the dorsal horn adjacent to injured peripheral neurons (Zhang et al., 2003). Abbadie et al. (2003) found that CCR2 chemokine receptor null mutant mice had dramatic deficits in neuropathic pain. In a model of neuropathic pain, the development of mechan- ical allodynia was totally abrogated in CCR2 knockout mice. In response to nerve ligation, persistent and marked up-regulation of CCR2 mRNA was normally evident in the nerve and dorsal root ganglion. Chronic pain also resulted in the appearance of activated CCR2- positive microglia in the spinal cord. Thus macrophages and microglia bearing the chemokine receptor CCR2 (and P2X4 receptors) appear to play an important role in neuropathic pain pathogenesis and represent an exciting new prospect for drug development. TARGET VALIDATION METHODS IN THE STUDY OF NEUROPATHIC PAIN Dissecting the role of potential targets in regulating pain thresholds has often relied upon the use of suppos- edly selective pharmacological agents (e.g., MK801—an antagonist for NMD A receptors), but for many signaling systems there are no specific antagonists to analyze their physiological function. In such situations, three genetic approaches can prove informative: the use of antisense oligonucleotides, the specific down-regulation of mRNA using small interfering RNA (siRNA), and the genera- tion of mice with targeted mutations. Each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages. Antisense technology is cheap, but specificity is a pr oblem because high concentrations of oligonucleotide may have some cellular toxicity, and may also target structurally related transcripts. SiRNA technology is still being developed, but has already revolutionized C.elegans genetics, where the specificity of siRNA action and the catalytic nature of RNA degradation mean that very low concen- trations of dsRNA can be used. SiRNA is effective in vitro and in vivo in primary sensory neurons, where a 21bp complementary double-stranded RNA can be used to specifically degrade cognate RNA sequences through the formation of a complex with ribonucleases (Figure 20.6). siRNA acts transiently and catalytically, and may not lead to long-lived RNA degradation (part of its attrac- tion), but for animal models where neuropathic pain is modelled over a period of weeks, this is a major diffi- culty. Null mutants do not share this problem, but the problems of developmental compensatory mechanisms and death during development have often provided obstacles to interpretation of phenotype. It is also desir- able to generate mice where tissue-specific deletions can be carried out, and ideally postnatal activation of Cre recombinase should be possible. Thanks to the work of Sauer and collaborators (Le and Sauer, 1999), who have exploited the recombinase activity of a bacteriophage enzyme Cre, to delete DNA sequences that are flanked by lox-P sites recognized by this enzyme, it was possible to New Molecular Targets for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain 351 dsRNA Dicer ds- RNase complex 21-23bp dsRNA RISC complex Cognate mRNA mRNA degradation RNA interference as a route to blocking gene expression FIGURE 20.6 In the first step, input double-stranded (ds) RNA is processed by the enzyme DICER into 21–23- nucleotide “guide sequences.” In mammals, these dsRNAs may also be introduced into the cell after chemical syn- thesis by standard transfection techniques. The dsRNAs are incorporated into a nuclease complex, called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which acts in the second effector step to destroy mRNAs that are recog- nized by the guide RNAs through base-pairing interactions.

To ablate genes in sensory ganglia, it is necessary to produce mice in which functional Cre recombinase is driven by sensory neuron-specific promoters. To analyze the effectiveness of expressed Cre in excising lox-P-flanked genes, a reporter mouse using the β -galactosidase express- ing gene with a floxed (lox-P flanked) stop signal can be used. Where Cre removes the stop signa, β -galactosidase activity can be analyzed histochemically. It will also be useful to generate transgenic mice expressing Cre in sub- sets of sensory neurons and drug-activatable Cre isoforms. Recently a tamoxifen-activatable form of Cre recombinase has been developed. This form of Cre recombinase com- prises a fusion protein between Cre and a human mutated estrogen receptor. The addition of tamoxifen but not endogenous steroids allows the Cre recombinase to assume an active conformation. This method allows the excision of genes at defined periods in adulthood. This powerful technology is likely to be applied increasingly over the next few years, and together with siRNA promises to speed up target validation strategies in animal models of neuropathic pain. DRG-specific CRE- recombinase mice have been made by a number of mice, and an increasing number of floxed target genes (e.g., BDNF) are also now available for this type of analysis (Figure 20.7). TRANSLATING TARGETS INTO TREATMENTS Because a complex interplay between many types of molecules within damaged neurons, glia, and cells of the immune system underlies the establishment of chronic neuropathic pain, there is now a wealth of potential molecular targets which may be useful in the treatment of pain. Huge strides in understanding the molecular basis for pain have recently been made. A key to the develop- ment of useful analgesic drugs is to avoid unnecessary side effects. Importantly, as yet there is not a single target that has been shown to be uniquely associated with the establishment of neuropathic pain. Thus we may be faced with the challenge of developing magic shrapnel rather than a magic bullet. Nonetheless, the concept of a magic bullet for the treatment for pain remains an important one, since some molecules may play predominant (although not solitary) roles in the production of pain, and as noted previously, some molecules such as specific types of sodium channels are selectively expressed in nociceptive neurons. As yet, many of the most attractive targets (e.g., sodium channels) do not have specific phar- macological blockers or activators. However, the intense focus of academia and of the pharmaceutical industry on the problem of neuropathic pain suggests that progress will be made in short order, with important con- sequences for clinical treatment.

If possible, it is reasonable to initiate protective measures before onset and to prevent further degenera- tion, once the disease appears. In reality, most patients are free of symptoms until most of the relatively vulner- able cells are dysfunctional or dead. For this reason, and since any retardation of degeneration is unlikely to be absolute, it is rational to develop cell replacement for the lost neurons and glia. Such “live cell” replacement thera- pies are conceptually different from classical pharmacol- ogy. Novel cell-based therapies therefore have generated many new questions in the neurological community and skepticism. These novel cell repair and regeneration ther- apies are experimental, with limited data accumulated on the best therapeutic cell compositions and application to the potentially responsive patient groups. In Parkinson’s disease (PD), there are patients who have experienced sig- nificant and long-lasting benefits after fetal cell transfer to gray matter. These benefits are physiologically verified (fluorodopa PET scans and functional MRI), long- lasting (beyond 14 years), and clinically meaningful (50% to 60 % reduction in clinical scores off DA drug therapy) (Piccini et al. , 1999; Piccini et al. , 2000). Transfer of fetal dopamine (DA) neuron–containing suspension (about 5% DA cell content) into putamen (Mendez et al. , 2002; Piccini et al. , 1999; Piccini et al. , 2000) has so far yielded the best results in patients with PD (Figure 21.1; see also the Color Plate section). There appears to be less benefit to patients, and substantially higher risk for side effects, after implantation of solid tissue-piece fetal DA cells (also approximate 5% cell DA content) (Freed et al., 2001; McNaught et al. , 2002). To understand the hurdles of developing a neurological cell therapy, it is instructive to look at the history of other live cell therapies. Surgical cell replacement (cell transplantation) instead of insulin injection for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus was initially heralded as a potential breakthrough, but a number of biological and technical hurdles have slowed progress (Ryan et al. , 2002; Weir et al. , 1990). As for diabetes mellitus, neuronal replacement thera- pies for PD have so far not successfully addressed all the complexities to make the cell transfer therapies work in patients with PD. Although fetal DA cell transfer has been validated and effective in some patients with PD, recent surgical applications of the techniques have not established the most effective parameters for cell prepa- ration, transplantation, immunological treatments, or patient selection. Modern double-blind pharmacological trial designs (which are indeed very good tools as final tests to establish the safety and clinical efficacy of well- designed drugs) were perhaps applied too early to evalu- ate these prototype treatments. Nonetheless, much can still be learned from these early trials, particularly about side effects (off-medication dyskinesia in PD) and the need for appropriate patient selection based on preoper- ative evaluations of drug responses, as well as disease severity and stage. As an example of differences between drug trials and cell-based studies, a double-blind cell transplantation trial used a 1-year endpoint as the con- clusion of the blind study, and final analysis of data 357 CHAPTER 21 Therapeutic Transfer and Regeneration of Neural Progenitors or Neurons in Gray Matter of the Adult Brain Ole Isacson, MD Ch21.qxd 9/2/04 10:25 AM Page 357"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"(Freed et al. , 2001). The 1-year time point using li ve imma- ture DA cells is insufficient for human fetal DA cells to fully grow and establish functional effects in ani mal mod- els or patients (Isacson et al. , 2001). Consequently, after the study was published, many patients continued to improve during year 2 and 3 after surgery, as presumably the fetal cells continued to mature, integrate, adapt, and help improve the functional status of the patients with PD (Piccini et al. , 1999). DERIVING OR REGENERATING OPTIMAL PROGENITOR DOPAMINE NEURONS FOR PARKINSON’S DISEASE Midbrain lateral substantia nigra DA loss of function creates parkinsonism. This specific DA loss produces akine- sia, rigidity, and tremor. During brain development, new- born DA cells migrate into fetal midbrain and send axons to targets in the emerging striatum and cortex. The DA neuron is generated by cell signals emanating from factors released around the ventral midbrain from neural ectoderm or ES cells (Hynes and Rosenthal, 2000) (Figure 21.2; see also the Color Plate section). Remarkably, of the three original germ layers, the neural ectoderm and the brain develop partly through a so-called default pathway (Munoz-Sanjuan and Brivanlou, 2002). Similarly, after embryonic stem (ES) cells or embryoid body cells have become neural precursors, many will spontaneously acquire a neuronal midbrain- hindbrain identity, including DA cell specificity (Deacon et al. , 1998; Lee et al. , 2000b; Tropepe et al. , 2001) (see Figure 21.2). When there is an absence or block of meso- dermal and endodermal signals, the ES cells will become primitive and eventually differentiated neuronal cell types. This process was described initially in frogs and in knock- out gene cell systems, where bone morphogenetic protein 358 Therapeutic Transfer and Regeneration FIGURE 21.1 Preoperative and postoperative fluorodopa PET scans obtained in a patient with Parkinson’s dis- ease who received simultaneous intrastriatal and intranigral fetal VM grafts.

One of the cell types that is derived from such spontaneous neural differen- tiation is the DA cell type (Deacon et al. , 1998; Lee et al. , 2000b). Our work in 1998 (Deacon et al. , 1998) showed that this default pathway also operated in mammalian cells after transplantation, or in a cell culture dish (Lee et al. , 2000b; Tropepe et al. , 2001). It was demonstrated that when cells are dissociated and transplanted at very low concentrations (simulating a low access cell-mediated contact and presum- ably an absence of BMP signaling) into tissues, a neuronal identity was the default cell choice—which in the mouse included DA and serotonergic neurons (Bjorklund et al. , 2002) (Figures 21.2 and 21.3; see also the Color Plate sec- tion). The actual genetic subprograms controlling the mid- brain DA cell type development appear to include sequential and parallel action of several transcription fac- tors. Following proliferation in the ventricular zone, neu- roblasts will migrate down toward the central and lateral ventral mesencephalon. The FGF8-rich zone and territories reached by SHH protein (Hynes and Rosenthal, 2000) induce in the progenitor cells a sequence and group of tran- scription factors and enzymes that establish most of the cell character of the midbrain neurons that share the DA trans- mitter type (see Figure 21.3). Engrail genes, Nurr1 and PitX3 , are some of the most typical transcription factors of this set. Nurr1 certainly activates most of the transmitter- related genes and some of the trophic signaling pathways (Kim et al. , 2003), but PitX3 is also critical to the construc- tion and survival of DA neurons that can reach motor con- trol regions of the caudate-putamen (Burbach et al. , 2003). In fact, the functional absence of PitX3 during development will cause the A9 DA neuron to fail to establish in the mid- brain, whereas the A10 VTA neuron can still survive, grow, and function in the limbic circuitry. In our experiments, the ES cell–derived DA neurons reinnervated the brain and restored DA transmission (Figure 21.4; see also the Color Plate section). This was shown by DA release, behavioral correction of a motor syndrome, and functional integration (blood flow and restored activity in cerebral cortex) (Bjorklund et al. , 2002) (see Figure 21.4). More recent works confirmed these findings and also enhanced the design of ES cells to more readily and reliably generate necessary fetal DA cells as replacement donor cells in PD (Chung et al. , 2002b; Kim et al. , 2002). It is pos- sible to enhance the percent of ES cells that become DA neurons by stably inserting and expressing the gene trans- cription factor Nurr1, which drives genes associated with the DA cell type—for instance, tyrosine hydroxylase (the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of dopamine) and the dopamine transporter, responsible for transmitter reuptake (see Figure 21.3). Dopa-decarboxylase present in dopamin- ergic and serotonergic neurons is also induced by Nurr1 , along with several other marker and trophic support genes typical of the midbrain, including the c-ret components (Grf- α subunit) of the GDNF receptor (Wallen et al. , 2001). It has also been demonstrated that the ES cells can be dif- ferentiated into DA neurons in cell culture, and this process is enhanced by overexpression of Nurr1 (Chung et al. , 2002a; Kim et al. , 2002) (see Figure 21.3). Transplanting such cells at their fetal DA equivalent stage into the rat brain produces reinnervation of the degenerated host stria- tum, and creates a behavioral recovery from deficits associ- ated with the dopamine deficiency (Kim et al. , 2002). In conclusion, genetic engineering of stem cells, cell sorting, and selection technologies are viable methods to generate the potentially therapeutic DA cells. CLINICAL APPLICATION OF THE EMERGING CELL-BASED TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR PARKINSON’S DISEASE New therapeutic non-pharmacological methods involve cell and synaptic renewal or replacement in the living brain to restore function of neuronal systems, including the DA system in PD (Isacson et al., 2003).

It has been demonstrated that functional motor deficits associated with PD can be reduced after application of this new technology. Evidence shows that the underlying disease process does not destroy the trans- planted fetal DA cells, although the patient’s original DA system degeneration progresses (Piccini et al. , 1999; Piccini et al. , 2000). The optimal DA cell regeneration system would reconstitute a normal network capable of restor- ing feedback-controlled release of DA in the nigro- striatal system (Bjorklund and Isacson, 2002).

In the case of mouse embryonic stem cells, these cells can grow on feeder layers in leukemia inhibitor factors (LIF) in stage 1. At this stage, various genes can be added or deleted. In the case of Nurr1, it is a positive drive for transcription of dopamine and neuron-related genes. At stage 2, embryoid bodies are formed containing similarly pluripotent cells. In the left panel, as shown by Kim et al. (2002), the embryonic stem cells are brought in five stages to their fetal stage, in which they are then made into a cell suspension and transplanted directly into the Parkinson rat model. Similarly to the default pathway, these embryonic stem cell derived fetal neu- rons will create a functional recovery on amphetamine rotation, as well as a number of spontaneous tasks includ- ing reaching tasks and other evidence of corrected dopamine deficiency. In the upper panel (Bjorklund et al. , 2002), the cells are dissociated at specific cell concentrations and can be placed directly in the brain on low con- centrations and will then, after a few weeks’ time, develop over the species-specific program towards dopaminer- gic and serotonergic neurons. In previous experiments, such neurons would, over time, produce sufficient dopamine to correct the behavioral syndrome of Parkinson’s disease asymmetry, such that the correction can be normalized if sufficient cells are reinnervating the brain compared to sham cells (Bjorklund et al. , 2002).

In clinical trials, despite technical shortcomings, human fetal dopamine specified phenotypic ventral mesen- cephalic (VM) neurons have shown functional capacity in patients with PD (Freed et al. , 2001; Lindvall and Hagell, 2000; Mendez et al. , 2002; Piccini et al. , 1999; Piccini et al. , 2000; Ramachandran et al. , 2002). Unregulated produc- tion of DA from grafted fetal neurons is the cause of unwanted dyskinesias seen in a subset of patients with PD who have undergone transplantation (Freed et al. , 2001; Olanow, 2002). This is quite possible in a scenario of a “primed” dyskinetic circuitry produced by previous L - dopa treatment in a patient. Nonetheless, preclinical and clinical transplantation work demonstrates that striatal DA terminal release from appropriately grafted fetal DA neurons is controlled by both cell intrinsic and extrinsic synaptic and autoreceptor mechanisms and therefore, at least theoretically, the risk for dyskinesias should be less than that with drug treatments (Bjorklund and Isacson, 2002; Piccini et al. , 1999). In animal models, fetal DA- grafted neurons can reduce L -dopa–induced peak dyskine- sias (Lee et al. , 2000a). In grafted DA neurons, presynaptic DA autoreceptors regulate excess DA release, and in vivo infusion of the full DA agonist apomorphine can block spontaneous DA release in the striatum (Bjorklund and Isacson, 2002; Strecker et al. , 1987; Zetterstrom and Ungerstedt, 1984). IS IT NECESSARY TO OBTAIN STRUCTURAL RECONSTITUTION OF TERMINAL SYNAPTIC FUNCTION AND CONTROLLED DOPAMINE RELEASE BY NEW DOPAMINE NEURONS? The scientific and clinical field of neural and cell repair has experienced major conceptual problems, per- haps typical of all new technologies. The initial success of L -dopa for PD, and growth of pharmacology as a medical discipline, in some ways prevented a paradigm shift to new molecular, cell biological, and regenerative strategies. Pharmacology-like reasoning suggested that a “biological pump” of dopamine would be sufficient for functional recovery in PD. This misconception led to several unsuccessful clinical trials, for example those involving autologous transplantation of catecholamine- containing adrenal medulla cells (Backlund, 1985; Madrazo, 1988). The lack of recovery, the low adrenal medulla graft survival, and the reported morbidity of patients with PD strengthened, however, the rationale for using dopamine-releasing fetal neural mesencephalic donor cells (instead of adrenal medulla that produces minute nonsynaptic DA even after nerve growth factor stimulation). Again, however, the cell therapy using fetal DA neurons is in a “prototype” technology phase, since the quality of cell implantation technology and cell preparations using fetal DA cells is variable, and highly experimental in PD (Isacson, 2003). Thus, cell transfer and brain repair using immature neurons and glia is innovative both from the technical and biological stand- points, and will require much work to optimize. The scaling up of this method from rodents to primates and humans has proved very demanding, particularly in obtaining an acceptable, abundant, and reliable donor cell source and preparation and consistent surgical results. Early studies indicated some motor improve- ment associated with increased fluorodopa uptake (Widner et al. , 1992). Longitudinal and validated data from Lindvall and colleagues indicate stable DA cell sur- vival and function in patients for over a decade after sur- gery and substantially reduced need for pharmacological substitution by dopaminergic drugs (Piccini et al. , 1999; Piccini et al. , 2000). The transplantation of non-dissoci- ated (solid) human VM tissue pieces has also provided benefits to some patients (Freed et al. , 1992; Freeman et al. , 1995). In a series of pilot transplantation studies carried out by Olanow and colleagues in the United States, autopsy from two bilaterally transplanted (6.5- to 9-week human fetal VM) patients who died 18 to 19 months after surgery showed over 200,000 surviving DA neurons, which partially reinnervated the right putamen (about 50%) and the left putamen (only about 25%) (Kordower et al. , 1996). Electron microscopy revealed axo-dendritic and occasional axo-axonic synapses between graft and host was possible, and analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA revealed higher expression within the fetal neurons than within the residual host nigral cells (Kordower et al. , 1996). Autopsy of another patient in this surgical group showed over 130,000 surviving DA neurons, reinnervat- ing almost 80% of the putamen (Kordower et al. , 1998). Notably, both patients had shown major improvements in motor function and increases in fluorodopa uptake in the putamen on positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. Nevertheless, these and other detailed obser- vations indicate that many specific regions of the human putamen may not be innervated by such nonspecific VM grafts, unless they contain the appropriate number and type of the A9 dopamine neuronal phenotype (Haque et al. , 1997; Mendez et al. , 2003). More critically, the clin- ical trials using fetal “noodle” and solid mesencephalic tissue also created significant side effects in the form of dyskinesias typical of DA excess and striatal lesions 362 Therapeutic Transfer and Regeneration Ch21.qxd 9/2/04 10:26 AM Page 362"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"(Freed et al. , 2002; Hantraye et al. , 1992; Olanow, 2002). The most important factor in obtaining optimal functional effects (and minimal side effects) in PD by brain repair is probably the presence of new terminals and DA transmission that adequately adapt to the local milieu, and provide physiologically appropriate DA release in the host caudate-putamen and substantia nigra (Bjorklund and Isacson, 2002; Isacson, 2003; Piccini et al. , 1999; Piccini et al. , 2000) and synaptic feedback control, such as DAT and DA D2 receptors. Fetal DA neurons typically grow to establish functional connections with mature host striatal neurons. Synaptic contacts between transplanted fetal DA cells and host cells, as well as afferent contact by host neurons to transplanted cells, have been observed ultrastructurally (Doucet et al. , 1989; Mahalik et al. , 1985). The critical insight is that pharmacological delivery of DA into the striatum may in the end not be as effective in ameliorat- ing the motor symptom of PD, as regulated, synaptic release provided with transplanted DA neurons (Isacson et al. , 2003). First, when DA is directly admin- istered into the ventricles of patients with PD, serious psychosis and motor abnormalities develop (Venna et al. , 1984). Second, after high DA levels in vivo , experiments show an abnormal up-regulation of a large number of genes within the striatum (Gerfen et al. , 1998). Complications associated with unregulated DA levels are also obvious when observing effects of long-term L - dopa administration in patients. As PD progresses, and the midbrain DA neuron and its synapses continue to degenerate, the non-physiological levels of DA within the striatum and abnormal downstream activity in the basal ganglia produce severe motor abnormalities, such as dyskinesias. In neurophysiological recordings, it is clear that dopamine provides a modulatory role for the glutamate-mediated transmission, so that it appears to have a form of a gating function at that important stri- atal synapse (Freeman et al. , 1985; Grace , 1991; Johnson et al. , 1992; Ljungberg et al. , 1992; Nutt et al. , 2000; Onn et al. , 2000; Strecker and Jacobs, 1985). Ph ysio- logically appropriate DA functions can be achieved by normal DA synapses or, alternatively, cells that express the complete set of feedback elements required to regu- late release and uptake of DA (Isacson and Deacon, 1997; Strecker et al. , 1987; Zetterstrom et al. , 1986). DA-mediated involvement in the striatal neuronal net- work is such that unless there is tonic release of DA that is finely regulated at the synaptic cleft by afferents, glu- tamatergic synapses will be less effective in control of the striatal GABAergic output neurons (Nutt et al. , 2000; Onn et al. , 2000). Discontinuous stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors following loss of DA terminals or excessive L -dopa treatment is likely a major cause of dyskinesia induction. Normall y, basal changes in firing by mesencephalic dopamine neurons is limited, at least as has been tested in animal models (Ljungberg et al. , 1992; Strecker and Jacobs, 1985). More importantly, such frequency stimulation does not raise the extracel- lular concentration of putaminal dopamine because the synaptic network and terminals work to reduce fluctua- tions in DA concentration by reuptake mechanisms (DAT) and possibly other autoreceptor-mediated func- tions (D2) (Freeman et al. , 1985; Grace, 1991; Johnson et al. , 1992; Ljungberg et al. , 1992; Nutt et al. , 2000; Onn et al. , 2000; Strecker and Jacobs, 1985). Indeed, fetal DA transplants have been shown to reduce the incidence of L -dopa–induced peak dyskinesias in animal models (Lee et al. , 2000a). Several clinical studies have also shown normalized metabolic and brain functional activity throughout the basal ganglia after DA neural transplantation (Piccini et al. , 1999; Piccini et al. , 2000). PET and carbon-11–labeled 2B-carbomethoxy-3B- (4-fluorophenyl)tropane (11C-CFT) can be used to visu- alize and quantify striatal presynaptic DA transporters in PD patients and degeneration models. In one such study of a unilateral lesion of the SN DA system in rodents, the binding ratio was initially reduced to 15–35% of an intact side. After fetal DA neuronal trans- plantation, behavioral recovery occurred gradually when the 11C-CFT binding ratio had increased to 75–85% of the intact side, revealing a threshold for functional recovery in the lesioned nigrostriatal system after neural transplantation that fits our understanding of the nor- mal DA motor system requirements (Brownell et al. , 1998). Importantly, autoregulation of DA release and metabolism by intrastriatal DA cell containing grafts has been shown by in vivo microdialysis in the striatum. Infusion of a nonselective DA agonist (apomorphine) almost abolishes endogenous DA release in the DA neuron-grafted striatum (Galpern et al. , 1996; Strecker et al. , 1987), showing a near-normal autoregulation of DA levels by the implanted DA neurons. The forma- tion of effective DA terminals and synapses with ade- quate DA release and control have been determined in transplanted rodents after dyskinesia inducing L -dopa injections (Gaudin et al. , 1990; Lee et al. , 2000a). L -dopa–induced peak-dose dyskinesias in non-human primates are also much reduced after fetal DA cell trans- plantation (H. Widner, personal communication). These data indicate that DA levels within the transplanted striatum can be regulated in a functional manner by cor- rectly transplanted DA neurons if they act as the normal functional cellular regulators of DA neurotransmission in their normal target areas (Bjorklund and Isacson, 2002; Isacson and Deacon, 1997).

Most of these vari- ables have not been systematically evaluated in primates or patients. This is not because of passivity on anybody’s part, but rather a reflection of the technical and cellular challenges that the new cell therapies present. Small exploratory (and lately a couple of placebo-controlled) trials have shown both encouraging results in some patients (validated by analytic imaging and postmortem studies) and the potential problems with getting the right cells to the right brain regions and those patients who may benefit the most. The specific preparations of donor cells and associated procedures are very important in cell-based therapies and there are major differences in cell preparations for transplantation in PD in clinical tri- als to date. The most successful method involves freshly dissected fetal tissue pieces (minute cubic millimeter pieces) that can be treated with proteolytic enzymes, then dissociated into a cell suspension (Brundin et al. , 1985; Lindvall and Hagell, 2000; Mendez et al. , 2002; Piccini et al. , 1999; Piccini et al. , 2000; Ramachandran et al. , 2002). Other less effective procedures have included untreated tissue pieces, minced from the ventral mesen- cephalon of aborted fetuses (Freeman et al. , 1995; Henderson et al. , 1991; Kordower et al. , 1995; Olanow, 2002). A third type, the so-called noodle technique (Freed et al. , 2001) includes a cell culture step. Such cul- ture steps may alter the cells and select for cell types that are different than the populations obtained by fresh preparations. These three different techniques produce different grafts. Only the cell suspension grafts grow to slender deposits that do not disrupt or displace the host target tissue (Brundin et al. , 1985; Mendez et al. , 2002; Piccini et al. , 1999; Piccini et al. , 2000; Ramachandran et al. , 2002). In any event, all the current PD transplan- tation studies have employed rather crude cell prepara- tions, because the starting point for all work are the pieces dissected from fetal tissue, which contain only approximately 10% newborn DA neurons; the rest are cells of types not generally relevant to PD degeneration (Brundin et al. , 1985), except the progenitors of glial sup- port cells. In addition, while there is selective degenera- tion of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc; A9) neurons, with a relative sparing of ventral tegmental area (VTA; A10) neurons in PD (Gibb, 1992; Iacopino and Christakos, 1990; Ito et al. , 1992; Yamada et al. , 1990), both of these DA cell groups are currently transplanted as a mixture (Freed et al. , 2001; Hauser et al. , 1999; Kordower et al. , 1996; Lindvall et al. , 1988). Notably, these two subpopulations of DA neurons within the SN have very different functions and project to different brain areas (importantly also within the SN, through dendritic release). The medial- to midline-positioned DA neurons (known as area A10) (Dahlstrom and Fuxe, 1964) selec- tively send axons to limbic and cortical regions (Gerfen et al. , 1987) while the adjacent lateral A9 DA neurons (the major dysfunction in PD) grow selectively to puta- men areas controlling motor function (Damier et al. , 1999). Thus, the differences between A10 and A9 DA neurons (Costantini et al. , 1997; Haque et al. , 1997) are potentially very important for understanding how to make cell replacement strategies work in patients with PD. In summary, while current work demonstrates a clear capacity of fetal dopamine cell transplants to repair PD brains (Mendez et al. , 2000b; Piccini et al. , 1999; Piccini et al. , 2000), there are technical limitations with available prototypes of this new technique. Both animal model experiments and clinical trials are limited by today’s mixed cell preparations of low DA neuronal yield, inappropriate surgical placements in the brain, and potentially the loss of DA cell subpopulations of thera- peutic interest during tissue incubation, cell culture, and preparation steps. Practically and ethically it is not possi- ble to use fetal tissue as a source for transplantation for PD in more than rare experimental situations. For exam- ple, to replace a sufficient number of DA neurons, one needs six to eight fetal tissue pieces per patient, primarily because of low post-transplantational survival of the grafted fetal DA neurons. In addition, current surgical techniques are inconsistent with respect to placement, volume, and type of cells grafted. However, it is encour- aging that recent research in stem cell biology may pro- vide a solution to this problem of low cell access and yield (Bjorklund et al. , 2002; Kim et al. , 2002). CAN WE PRODUCE BETTER THERAPIES WITH FEWER SIDE EFFECTS BY ACCOMPLISHING A MORE SPECIFIC CELLULAR AND SYNAPTIC DOPAMINE REPLACEMENT? Recently it has been postulated that excess and unreg- ulated production of DA from grafted fetal neurons could be responsible for some unwanted side effects seen in patients with PD who have undergone transplantation (Freed et al. , 2001). However, it has been convincingly demonstrated that striatal DA release normally is tightly regulated by both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Presynaptic dopamine auto-receptors regulate excess DA release and administration of the DA agonist apomor- phine can inhibit spontaneous DA release up to 100% (Zetterstrom and Ungerstedt, 1984). It is believed that approximately 50% of this inhibition can be contributed to a direct effect on DA autoreceptors and 50% involves 364 Therapeutic Transfer and Regeneration Ch21.qxd 9/2/04 10:26 AM Page 364"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"postsynaptic neurons engaged in short- and long-distance feedback circuits (Zetterstrom and Ungerstedt, 1984). Subsequently it has been shown that grafted fetal DA neurons also display similar auto-inhibition mechanisms as demonstrated by a 40% reduction in spontaneous DA release when grafted animals are treated with apomor- phine (Bjorklund and Isacson, 2002; Strecker et al. , 1987). These basic studies are important, because they provide evidence contrary to current theories that implanted DA neurons may release excess amounts of DA in an unregu- lated manner and thereby contribute to side effects such as dyskinesias (Freed et al. , 2001). Instead, such side effects may have several alternative explanations (Isacson et al. , 2001). DA released from nerve terminals into the synaptic cleft is normally rapidly taken up and transported back into the terminals by the dopamine transporter (DAT). This mechanism is important for appropriate tem- poral regulation of DA concentration in the synaptic cleft. When the DAT is blocked by agents such as cocaine, DA will remain in the synaptic cleft in higher concentra- tions and for longer time periods than normal thus allow- ing increased binding and activation of postsynaptic receptors. When fetal ventral midbrain is dissected prior to transplantation, most published protocols do not make any distinction between the DA neurons residing in the VTA (A10) and those in the SNc (A9) (Freed et al. , 2001; Hauser et al. , 1999; Kordower et al. , 1996; Lindvall et al. , 1988). These two midbrain subpopulations of DA neu- rons express different levels of the DAT (Blanchard et al. , 1994), project to different areas (Graybiel et al. , 1990), and show different response to growth factors (Johansson et al., 1995; Meyer et al. , 1999). In addition, patients with PD show a relative sparing of DA neurons in the VTA compared to the SNc indicating that the VTA DA neu- rons are less vulnerable compared to their SNc counter- parts (Abe, 1992; Gibb, 1992; Iacopino and Christakos, 1990; Yamada et al. , 1990). One possible explanation for the reported dyskinesias in five of 37 patients in the study by Freed et al. ( 2001) and 13 of 23 patients in the study by Olanow et al. ( 2002) could be that unselective prepa- rations of fetal tissue pieces containing fetal dopamine neurons before implantation may result in selective sur- vival of the less vulnerable, but inappropriate VTA DA neurons (Isacson et al. 2001). When such neurons are implanted into the putamen of patients with PD, they may form inappropriate connections with, or avoid the projection neurons of the putamen, because these are not their normal targets (Isacson et al. , 2001; Isacson and Deacon, 1997). In addition, differences in DAT expres- sion between subpopulations of DA neur ons (Blanchard et al. , 1994; Ciliax et al. , 1999; Sanghera et al. , 1997) may also result in abnormal dendritic DA release in the puta- men (Falkenburger et al. , 2001) and uptake patterns that could cause suboptimal DA transmission. Another likely reason for uncontrolled motor response after transplanta- tion is that location and size of tissue pieces implanted may in some cases create small lesions in the putamen with subsequent dysregulation of the GABAergic output neurons (as seen in Huntington’s chorea). This theory is supported by the fact that small lesions in the striatum of primates (modeling Huntington’s disease) make these ani- mals severely dyskinetic in response to DA agonist treat- ment (Burns et al. , 1995; Hantraye et al. , 1990; Hantraye et al. , 1992), that would also occur in a situation of diffuse release from inappropriate DA neurons placed as tissue pieces in the lateral putamen (Freed et al. , 2001; Olanow, 2002). Supporting such a view is the relative absence of side effects from transplanted fetal DA cells to humans, when donor cells are prepared and placed as liquid cell suspension into PD putamen (Lindvall and Hagell, 2000; Mendez et al. , 2000a; Ramachandran et al. , 2002; Schumacher et al. , 2000) (see Figure 21.1). Such grafts typically reach less destructive size, but are better inte- grated in the host with mor e extensive axonal and synaptic outgrowth into appropriate target zones (Mendez et al. 2004, submitted). Finally, of significance, the importance of appropriate cellular and biochemical characteristics of transplanted DA cells has also been shown by behavioral experiments. In a rodent model of parkinsonism, recovery from move- ment asymmetry is correlated with the rate of cellular maturation of the donor species (Bjorklund and Isacson, 2002; Isacson and Deacon, 1997). ES cells generating DA neurons also abide by such biological principles (Bjorklund and Isacson, 2002). Multiple anatomical analyses have demonstrated that specific axon guidance and cell differentiation factors remain in the adult and degenerating brain, providing growth and axonal guid- ance cues for fetal or ES cells (Haque et al. , 1997; Isacson and Deacon, 1996; Isacson et al. , 1995). SUBPOPULATIONS OF MIDBRAIN DOPAMINERGIC NEURONS PERFORM DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS AND REACH DIFFERENT TARGETS: ITS POTENTIAL RELEVANCE TO REPAIR OF PD BRAINS An important question in neural transplantation is the capacity for specific neuronal cell types to selectively reinnervate denervated host target regions (Isacson, 2003; Isacson and Deacon, 1996; Isacson et al. , 1995; Nilsson, 1988; Schultzberg et al. , 1984). Neurons devel- oped from fetal or ES cell stages, when transplanted into host targets display a relative specificity in axonal out- growth into regions typical of their mature phenotype (Isacson and Deacon, 1996; Isacson et al. , 1995; Nilsson, 1988; Schultzberg et al. , 1984). Midbrain DA neurons Therapeutic Transfer and Regeneration 365 Ch21.qxd 9/2/04 10:26 AM Page 365"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"can be clearly categorized into subpopulations based on differences in the expression of certain proteins such as the dopamine transporter, TH, calbindin, and cholecys- tokinin (CCK) and molecules performing target neuron selection (Blanchard et al. , 1994; Haber , 1995; Schultzberg et al., 1984). The biochemical markers used reflect spe- cific projection areas reached by the different categories of DA SN neurons. In rodents, Schultzberg et al. (1984) first demonstrated by grafting embryonic VM tissue into the dorsal deafferented striatum, that subsets of SN DA neurons have specific final patterns of axonal terminal networks. CCK-negative/TH (A9) cells extend their axons into the motor striatum, while CCK-positive/TH neurons (A10) do not. Instead, A10 DA neurons project their axons in cortical areas and limbic striatal regions. Another interesting protein is the retinoic acid-generating enzyme, aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (AHD2), which is expressed only in a subset of DA neurons in the substan- tia nigra (and VTA in some species) (McCaffery and Drager, 1994). Most AHD2 DA neurons project to the dorsal and rostral regions of the striatum and have a reduced DA terminal density gradient ventrally. Transplanted DA neurons at first appear to extend fibers in a nonspecific heliocentric fashion around the graft; however we have shown that the subset of transplanted DA fibers expressing AHD2 preferentially reinnervate the dorsolateral part of the rat striatum (Haque et al. , 1997). Histological observations of postmortem patient tissue (Isacson, unpublished) also indicate that trans- planted human DA neurons will only seek their normal targets; and actively avoid innervation of other caudate- putamen regions according to their specific neuronal phenotype. Interestingly, the AHD2 enzyme is very sen- sitive to oxidation which may correlate with increased vulnerability of A9 neurons seen in PD (McCaffery and Drager, 1994). Recently, we have found with our collabo- rators doing clinical trials, that cell surface markers such as G-protein linked inward rectifying potassium channels type 2 (GIRK2) are selectively expressed in ventral and midbrain A9 DA neurons (not expressing calbindin). These new data allow a more in-depth analysis of the cell types and their growth characteristics while repairing the DA system in PD. Our clinical work (Mendez et al. , 2003) now indicates that a substantial proportion of type A9 GIRK2-positive DA neurons can be obtained by fetal cell suspension grafts. Because only 2% to 10% of neu- rons normally in the dissected VM are of a phenotype DA, hypothetically after transplantation they may com- pete for trophic support with the majority of the trans- planted non-DA neurons. It is well known that midbrain DA neurons are positively influenced by growth factors such as bFGF (Mayer et al. , 1993) and GDNF (Gr anholm et al. , 1997; Meyer et al. , 1999). Such trophic dependency may vary between midbrain DA cell subpopulations, and it is likely that a limited supply of trophic molecules influences DA cell survival and growth. In addition, 20% to 80% of the SN cell population in rodent laboratory studies of programmed cell death between P2 and P14 (Janec and Burke, 1993). In summary, transplanted fetal VM-derived DA neurons develop extensive axonal termi- nal networks, in the host striatum and nucleus accum- bens in a normal, dense, homogeneous fashion (Bjorklund et al. , 1980; Schultzberg et al. , 1984). By con- trast, identical phenotypic DA neurons (from fetal or stem cell derivation) only extend a few axons into the host brain when transplanted into non-target areas such as cortex, thalamus and hypothalamus (Abrous, 1988). Ultrastructural data show that grafted DA neurons are able to form appropriate and abundant synaptic connec- tions with medium-sized spiny striatal neurons, which are the primary target of the mesencephalic DA afferents (Clarke, 1988). The molecular mechanisms defining anatomical specificity of the DA projections have not been fully elucidated but they are likely to involve target- derived trophic signals and recognition of target-specific cell surface molecules by growth-cones (Isacson and Deacon, 1997). Is this cellular specificity of relevance to all cell ther- apy paradigms? We have demonstrated (Haque et al. , 1997) that a nonlinear regression function exists between DA neuron survival and extent of functional motor recovery. For example, approximately 590 rat-derived DA cells in the graft were necessary to obtain a 50% reduc- tion in motor asymmetry using solid piece VM trans- plants. A plateau in motor recovery was reached at about 1200 TH-positive neurons. Interestingly, using pieces (non-dissociated grafts), the number of cells required for a 50% reduction in rotation is higher than comparable values in the literature for cell suspension grafts (Haque et al. , 1997). There may be several reasons for differences in efficacy between single cell suspension grafts and tis- sue pieces. Single cell suspension grafts become more vas- cularized than multiple-fragment transplants (Leigh, 1994). Further, Nikkah et al. (1994) showed that smaller suspension grafts show relatively better axonal coverage of the striatum compared to larger grafts. Large grafts, whether transplanted as cell suspensions or as tissue pieces, may actually limit the direct access to host tissue cues causing grafted cells to have less interaction with the host and integrate more within the actual transplanted tissue. These data and reasons indicate that single fetal cells in smaller deposits or possibly endogenous progeni- tor cells integrate better into the host brain and elicit behavioral recovery more efficiently (Brundin et al. , 1985; Hernit-Grant, 1996; Sotelo, 1987). Co-grafting of embryonic striatal tissue with fetal VM show that such grafts result in enhanced DA neuronal survival and function through trophic support (Costantini and 366 Therapeutic Transfer and Regeneration Ch21.qxd 9/2/04 10:26 AM Page 366"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"Snyder-Keller, 1997). Thus, graft-host interaction and graft-graft interaction are both factors r egulating fetal VM transplant development. Interestingly, we established that the percentage reduction in rotations at 10 weeks’ post-transplantation is mostly associated with the pro- portion of AHD2-positive A9 DA neurons in the grafts (Haque et al. , 1997). An inverse tendency was also appar- ent with the presence of A10 neurons. This observation suggests that the greater the proportion of A9 neurons in cell transfer or repair, the greater the degree of sympto- matic recovery of motor signs or abnormalities. The importance of proper development of appropriate molecular and phenotypic cell characteristics can be observed in the functional effects of transplanted xeno- geneic DA neurons. In xenografting experiments in a rat model of parkinsonism, recovery from amphetamine- induced motor asymmetry is tightly linked to the normal developmental rate of the species from where the grafted DA neurons are derived (Bjorklund and Isacson, 2002; Isacson and Deacon, 1997). Galpern et al. (1996) reported that between 80 and 120 porcine TH-positive neurons were required to see the same statistical effect using 120 to 140 rodent DA neurons, which is consistent with larger species-determined axonal growth areas in animals with larger brains. In summary, the pathology of PD reveals a relatively selective loss of DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc; A9) with a relative sparing of ventral tegmental area (VTA; A10) neurons. Our preliminary stud- ies and reasoning suggest that selective repair by A9 DA cells in the putamen is more likely to contribute to sympto- matic relief and prevent motor side-effects compared to implantation of the A10 DA cell group (Brownell et al. , 1998; Haque et al. , 1997; Mendez et al. , 2003). For exam- ple, transplanted A9 (AHD2 + , GIRK2 + and dopamine D2 receptor + ) neurons selectively reinnervate the appropriate motor regions of the affected putamen and correlate better with improved behavioral function in rodent models (Haque et al. , 1997) than non-A9 SN DA neurons. Because the A9 DA neurons have a better capacity to down-regulate dopamine release than A10 DA neurons by synaptic mech- anisms, the A9 neurons are also a priori less likely to have unregulated DA release, that may cause too high or low and unstable DA levels provoking motor side effects, such as dyskinesia in patients as typically seen after long-term L - dopa or DA agonist treatment (Isacson et al. , 2001; Olanow and Obeso, 2000; Olanow and Tatton, 2000). GENERATION OF A STEM CELL–DERIVED THERAPY FOR PARKINSON’S DISEASE Previous work has shown that DA neurons can be expanded in a cell culture dish from growth factor expanded embryonic day 12 (E12) VM precursor cells (Studer et al. , 1998) or ES cells (Kawasaki et al. , 2000; Lee et al. , 2000b), as well as from Nurr1 transfected mouse pro- genitor clones cultured with midbrain type 1 astrocytes (Wagner et al. , 1999). Remarkably, by injecting the undif- ferentiated ES cell directly into living tissue (brain or kid- ney capsule) ES cells or embryoid body cells can spontaneously differentiate into neurons (Deacon et al. , 1998) (see Figure 21.4). We have recently demonstrated that naïve ES cells implanted in low numbers into a DA- depleted striatum can develop and function as replicas of the DA neurons lost in PD. These new cells restore amphet- amine induced motor symmetry and cortical activation (Bjorklund and Isacson, 2002) lost both in PD and PD animal models (see Figure 21.4). Such findings suggest that ES cells are a reasonable cell source for PD transplantation and could overcome the problem associated with using fetal primary neuron (pre-differentiated) or the fetal VM expanded precursor cells (Studer et al. , 1998), which both show low in vivo survival rates after transplantation (3% to 5% of the grafted DA neurons) (Brundin and Bjorklund, 1998; Studer et al. , 1998). In contrast, the direct ES cell transfer to brain has a high in vivo yield (up to fourfold) expansion and differentiation into DA neurons from a small number of implanted cells (1000 ES cells) (Bjorklund and Isacson, 2002). Vigorous basic research that defines the developmental sequences and repair mechanisms involved in fetal and stem cell–derived DA neuron cell therapy will likely provide a future modality for the treatment of PD. Nonetheless, the growth potential of the cell source (ES) also needs to be tempered and controlled (Bjorklund and Isacson, 2002). The risk for growth of non-neural tissues from the endodermal and mesodermal germ-layers needs to be eliminated (Bjorklund and Isacson, 2002). This can be accomplished by blocking activation or influence of meso- and endodermal cell fate inducers (Bjorklund and Isacson, 2002). HOW CAN STEM CELL BIOLOGY RESEARCH HELP PARKINSON PATIENTS? Most living systems undergo continuous growth. In humans, bone marrow stem cells are capable of dividing into most of the cells necessary for blood and immune systems. Even entire tissues or organs, such as the liver, can be regrown. Cells in the lining of the gut are shed and replaced on a daily basis, and in the skin, the basal cell layers of the dermis provide a continuous supply of growth. In adult mature mammalian cell systems, it is however typical that only organ-specific and specialized progenitor cells divide to maintain growth of organ sys- tems in the body, while pathological processes can limit such replenishment. A fertilized cell is capable of cell Therapeutic Transfer and Regeneration 367 Ch21.qxd 9/2/04 10:26 AM Page 367"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"divisions that grow logarithmically and in the early clus- ter of cells (in the range of 250 cells) each cell is capable of (or appears to be) forming any germ layer and part of the body plan (Hemmati-Brivanlou and Melton, 1997). This type of cell is therefore denoted stem cell, or in this case, ES cells. Recently, such divisible (yet non-malignant and non-carcinogenic) cells have gained increased atten- tion. In a more limited scientific context, the concept and methodology of stem cell derived dopamine cells intrigues both neurobiologists and clinically oriented sci- entists, insofar as it could both explain the biology of the developing dopamine cells and what controls its func- tion, as well as generating a procedure for obtaining such cells in abundance for clinical applications. Starting at the genetic level, a number of genes related to the development or control of dopaminergic precursor proliferation, identity, and specialization (e.g., sonic hedgehog protein, LMX1b, PitX3 , Nurr1 , Engrail genes) act in concert with other transcription factors to activate specific transmitter enzymes (for instance TH, DAT, and dopa-decarboxylase) in dopaminergic neurons (Mandel et al. , 1998; Marsden, 1982; Montgomery et al. , 1996) (see Figure 21.3). An alternate or different route to cell repair is the possibility of manipulating inherent neurogenesis in the adult brain (Rakic, 2002). For example, in the adult brain exist neural precursor cells embedded in the sub- ventricular zone (SVZ) that are capable of migration and differentiation into different neural cell types (Alvarez- Buylla and Garcia-Verdugo, 2002). These neural progeni- tor cells can be expanded and studied, possibly even as a neuronal repair tool (Flax et al. , 1998). The expansion of SVZ neuroprecursor cells is stimulated by delivery of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), brain-derived neu- rotrophic factor (BDNF) (Benraiss et al. , 2000), noggin (Lim et al. , 2000), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) (Shimazaki et al. , 2001), or epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Craig et al. , 1996) to the CSF. Migration into the parenchyma can be stimulated by infusion of transform- ing growth factor-alpha (TGF- α ) into a target region (Fallon et al. , 2000). Neuronal differentiation from pre- cursors is enhanced by GDNF, BDNF (Zurn et al. , 2001) and natural BMP receptor antagonists (Lim et al., 2000). Expression of a dopaminergic phenotype can be driven by transcription factors such as PitX3 (Lebel et al. , 2001) and Nurr1 which drive genes of the full DA neuronal phe- notype such as TH, DAT and components of trophic fac- tor receptors (Saucedo-Cardenas et al. , 1998; Tornqvist et al. , 2002; Wallen et al. , 2001). Further, release of GDNF or BDNF by genetically modified cells in the cau- date-putamen can increase survival of precursor cells and of dopaminergic neurons in the SN following lesions (Akerud et al. , 2001), and the programmed cell death process can also be temporarily suspended by anti- apoptotic factors such as XIAP (Eberhardt et al. , 2002). Interestingly for novel therapies, genetically modified cells can also serve as biologic pumps to produce growth fac- tors that sustain neurons on site in the striatum or pro- jecting dopaminergic neurons from the SN (Akerud et al. , 2001; Brownell, 1994; Schumacher et al. , 1991). In summary, stem cell biology is valuable in a discov- ery process of several new and potential treatments for Parkinson’s disease. For example, research on ES cells may demonstrate the genetic transcription factors that control the specific genes participating in DA orches- trated neuronal function and cell development. Genetic programs have dynamic components; for example, con- certed actions of growth factors or neurotrophic factors that act as molecular switches required for initiating and maintaining the function of a DA neuron. The knowledge of how DA neurons can be formed would allow a reason- able process to be established for industrially producing a large number of such cells for transplantation or their regeneration inside the living brain (Isacson, 2003). The stem cell biology related to brain development and repair can be approached by methods using either adult or embryonic stem cells potentially capable of generating new neurons, after selective engineering, expansion in cell culture systems or in the living brain. The investigation of ES cells also provides a system in which transcription fac- tors responsible for directing the typical dopaminergic cell fate in the nigrostriatal systems can be determined. This allows a sophisticated understanding of the factors con- trolling the specialization and health of such cells. This research may yield a stable and renewable cell source for therapeutic use in neurodegenerative diseases. In conclusion, recent discoveries elucidating the cell biology of dopaminergic neurons allow both sequential and parallel strategies for protection of remaining cells and treating with new cells to restore function in Parkinson’s patients (Check, 2002). The rapidly develop- ing understanding of pathological mechanisms in Parkinson’s disease and the life cycle of the dopamine neuron from stem cells, via progenitor cells, to adult and later aging dopamine neurons provides reasonable opportunities for new interventions to reverse the effects of this disease. Nonetheless, detailed knowledge is neces- sary about (1) the appropriate neurons, (2) correct brain locations for repair, and (3) responsive PD patients for these regeneration therapies to become successful. THE CHALLENGES OF DEVELOPING NOVEL THERAPEUTICS USING LIVING CELLS AS AGENTS FOR PARKINSON’S DISEASE Neural disorders caused by acute and widespread damage, such as spinal cord trauma or stroke, pose for- midable conceptual and therapeutic challenges because 368 Therapeutic Transfer and Regeneration Ch21.qxd 9/2/04 10:26 AM Page 368"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"of the many cells and cell types required to reconstitute such tissues (Rossi and Cattaneo, 2002). Nevertheless, recent use of neural progenitors in animal models has produced some evidence for direct or induced regenera- tion associated with functional recovery. Given the major efforts placed on understanding biological and therapeu- tic factors involved, there is also hope for new cell based procedures in such cases. However, even for the best can- didate neurological diseases for cell therapy (such as PD), where neuronal repair is conceptually and practically proven to work in some patients, there is an apparent underestimation of the biological, technical, and cellular sophistication required to make the treatment reliable and safe. Although neural repair for PD may be a more challenging therapeutic development than cell-based therapy for type 1 diabetes mellitus, that experience may provide insight and perspective. About 25 years ago, the first reports were made of cell-based delivery of insulin as effective in rats with induced diabetes (Warnock et al. , 1983). The rapid application of this completely new tech- nology led to many disappointing clinical trials—where islet cells did not survive or function well. In the late 1990s, researchers revisited the conceptually elegant and useful idea of providing the patient with normal islet cells, with biofeedback to respond and release controlled levels of insulin (Weir et al. , 1990). By the recent work of clinical and basic research groups, between 150 and 200 patients with diabetes mellitus now have functioning islet cell transplants that in most cases have obviated the need for insulin injections, and probably the associated side effects of insulin injection (Ryan et al. , 2002). Likewise, understanding and accomplishing procedures that gener- ate, select, and transfer appropriate cells in brains of responsive patients will be a requirement for the success of future cell and cell-based therapies. The development of brain cell transplantation with embryonic neurons and glia is innovative both from a technical and biologi- cal standpoint and thus will require much work to opti- mize the transplant protocol. The scaling up of this method from rodents to primates has proved very challenging, particularly in obtaining an acceptable, abundant, and reliable donor cell source and tissue preparation. In a realistic future perspective, the most important fac- tor to consider in trying to obtain optimal functional effects (and minimal side effects) is probably the establish- ment of new synapses and DA transmission that ade- quately adapts to the local milieu and provides physiologically appropriate DA release in the nigrostriatal system. Notably, transplanted fetal DA neurons have been shown to grow synaptic connections with mature host stri- atal neurons (Doucet et al. , 1989; Mahalik et al. , 1985). Current evidence indicates that DA-mediated regulation of striatal neuronal and network interactions is of critical importance for normal motor control, and that if DA release is not regulated, glutamatergic synapses are less able to provide normal control of striatal GABAergic output neurons (Nutt et al. , 2000; Onn et al. , 2000). Physiological DA function is achieved by normal DA release and uptake. Implanted cells that express the complete set of feedback elements required to regulate the release and uptake of DA may function well (Isacson and Deacon, 1997; Strecker et al. , 1987; Zetterstrom et al. , 1986). Fetal DA trans- plants have been shown to reduce the incidence of L -dopa–induced dyskinesias in rodents with 6-OHDA lesions (Lee et al. , 2000a). Similarly, L -dopa–induced dyski- nesias in non-human primates also are reduced after fetal DA cell transplantation (Bjorklund and Isacson, 2002). In several cases after transplantation of fetal mesencephalic cell mixtures, patients with PD have been able to eliminate their dopamine medication altogether (Lindvall and Hagell, 2000; Mendez et al. , 2002). However, such cases are rare, and while transplants can survive for at least 15 years, there is limited understanding of optimal cell transfer parameters and patient selection. For the patients who have received cell transplants in Sweden, Canada, and the United States, it is not clear why some transplants work and others do not (Freed et al. , 2001; Lindvall and Hagell, 2000; Mendez et al. , 2002; Olanow, 2002). The current clin- ical studies have noted several mild-to-severe side effects caused by the implantation of dopaminergic cells. The primary problem has been the development of “off med- ication” dyskinesias in some patients with otherwise suc- cessful dopamine graft survival (not successful function) (Freed et al. , 2001; Olanow, 2002). The mechanism(s) that underlie these “off medication” dyskinesias are unknown. It has been shown that despite good graft viability, there is suboptimal reinnervation of the host target areas and sub- optimal dopamine cell composition of the transplanted and surviving grafts. In addition, some transplanted neu- rons may in effect produce too much and/or continuous dopamine for the denervated striatum, thereby producing dyskinesia during off periods, analogous to the well-known dopamine-induced dyskinesia during patients’ ON periods. The dopamine neuron is a highly specialized functional unit that has evolved to release dopamine in a very specific way in target structures. In this way, it is very different than a transmitter pump or any other cell that could release and supply dopamine. More optimal cell therapy for PD may therefore include only cells that function like A9 DA neu- rons, which are indeed specialized for function in putamen (excluding A10 cell types that work in mesolimbic and cor- tical settings). There are risks for other side effects and dyskinesia that depend on the final size and location of transplants; because posterior putamen lesions when exposed to dopamine will generate dyskinesias (perhaps by space-occupying lesions such as a grafts) (Hantraye et al. , 1992). These latest exploratory clinical transplantation Therapeutic Transfer and Regeneration 369 Ch21.qxd 9/2/04 10:26 AM Page 369"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"studies have found some evidence that the stage of the dis- ease and the responsiveness of the patient to L -dopa will influence the outcome of the transplantation procedures and function of the new dopamine cells. Some Parkinson’s plus syndromes are not L -dopa responsive. It has become apparent in recent controlled clinical trials in PD demon- strating that the severity of PD influences transplant effects, or lack thereof. Below the level of 50 point UPDRS, patients had significantly better responses than those with above 50 score on UPDRS, before surgery (Olanow, 2002). In summary, identifying responsive patients and the generation and production of appropriate neurons (specificity principle) are necessary criteria towards successful future cell therapies against neurologi- cal diseases. Additional criteria to provide patients with cell technology require information about surgical and proce- dural applications, including cell implantation locations and cell dosage, cell preparations and trophic factors, and immunological and connectivity variables to allow func- tional reconstitution neurocircuitry. Combined methods of stem cell design, cell genesis, and selection to repair spinal cord and cortical motor system in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the cortico-striatal system in Huntington’s dis- ease, or the motor circuitries involving the DA system in Parkinson’s Disease, may then lead to new regenerative and restorative therapies. Therefore, the current state-of-the-art cell therapy for PD appears to require transfer of appropriate and selec- tively placed DA neurons and glia in patients who are responsive to DA substitution therapy. Possibly, the emergence of stem cell generated DA neurons in concert with improved surgical and technical approaches may provide a more optimal intervention.

Within the adult ventricular zone, self-renewing and multipotential neural stem cells are widely dispersed throughout the adult ventricular wall (Kirschenbaum and Goldman, 1995; Morshead et al. , 1994; Weiss et al. , 1996), and are especially abun- dant in the forebrain, in which they have been identified in species ranging from mice to man (Gage, 2000; Goldman, 1998). In addition, phenotypically commit- ted neuronal progenitor cells remain widely distributed throughout the ventricular wall (Kirschenbaum and Goldman, 1995), especially within its rostral extensions to the olfactory bulb, and caudally through the sub- granular zone to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (Doetsch and Alvarez-Buylla, 1996; Doetsch et al. , 1997; Palmer et al. , 1997). Besides these neurogenic progenitor cell populations, glial progenitors also reside within both the ventricular zone and tissue parenchyma (Roy et al. , 1999). These include a subpop- ulation of multipotential parenchymal progenitors, which though nominally glial may generate neurons as well as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Kondo and Raff, 2000; Nunes et al. , 2003; Palmer et al. , 1999). In humans, these cells are dispersed throughout the sub- cortical white matter, just as in other infraprimate mammals (Nunes et al. , 2003). Together, these different classes of progenitors constitute the major known categories of neural precursor cells in the adult human central nervous system (CNS) (Figure 22.1; see also the Color Plate section) (reviewed in Alvarez-Buylla and Garcia-Verdugo, 2002; Goldman, 2001, 2003; Goldman et al. , 2002). ADULT PROGENITORS MAY BE CATEGORIZED AS DISTINCT POOLS OF TRANSIT-AMPLIFYING CELLS The neuronal and glial progenitor cells of the adult human brain may be considered akin to “transit ampli- fying cells,” which have now been described as such in a variety of solid tissues. As initially defined in the skin and GI mucosae, transit amplifying cells comprise the phenotypically biased, still-mitotic progeny of uncom- mitted stem cells (Loeffler and Potten, 1997; Niemann and Watt, 2002; Potten and Loeffler, 1990; Watt, 2001). As stem cell progeny depart these localized regions of stem cell expansion, their daughters may commit to more restricted lineages, phenotypically delimited but still mitotic, which comprise the transit-amplifying pools. Although these cells proliferate to expand discrete line- ages, they do not exhibit unlimited multilineage expan- sion, as distinct from their parental stem cells. By this definition, the neuronal and glial progenitor cells of the adult brain may be considered distinct tran- sit-amplifying derivatives of a common ventricular zone stem cell (Doetsch et al. , 2002; Goldman, 2003). The neuronal progenitor cell of the forebrain subependyma was first proposed as a transit amplifying cell type, on the basis of its neuronal bias during mitotic expansion, and its ability to replenish the stem cell pool under appropriate mitotic stimulation. (Garcia-Verdugo et al. , 1998). However, because the neuronally committed pro- genitor cells of the rostral migratory stream, and those of the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, both con- tinue to divide while migrating (Menezes et al. , 1995); they too comprise transit amplifying phenotypes (Doetsch et al. , 2002). Indeed, even the glial progenitor 375 CHAPTER 22 Cellular Plasticity of the Adult Human Brain Steven A.

The nominally glial progenitor cell of the brain parenchyma now appears to comprise by far the most abun- dant progenitor cell phenotype of the adult brain. In adult humans, in whom the subependymal zone is but a discon- tinuous monolayer, periventricular zone neural stem cells appear to comprise a relatively scarce pool (Pincus et al. , 1998), although the subependymal astrocytes from which they may derive may be more widely distributed (Sanai et al. , 2004). Similarly, the neuronal progenitor pool of the olfactory bulb appears to be similarly vestigial in humans, although the neuronal progenitors of the adult human hip- pocampus may be more abundant (Eriksson et al. , 1998; Roy et al. , 2000). As a result, in adult humans the major transit-amplifying pool would appear to reside within the parenchyma itself, in which large numbers of widely dis- persed glial progenitors provide an abundant reservoir of cycling, multipotential progenitors that, although restricted to glial phenotype in vivo , are multipotential and neuro- genic. These cells may comprise as many as 3% of all cells in the adult white matter, yielding remarkably high esti- mates for their absolute incidence (Nunes et al. , 2003; Roy et al. , 1999; Scolding et al. , 1999). Although the incidence of analogous parenchymal progenitor cells in the adult human gray matter has not yet been rigorously evaluated, these cells have already been described as abundant in the cortical gray matter of adult rodents (Palmer et al. , 1999), and there is no reason to think that they are any less abundant in humans. 376 Cellular Plasticity of the Adult Human Brain FIGURE 22.1 Progenitors of the adult human brain. This schematic illustrates the basic categories of progeni- tor cells in the adult brain, and their known interrelationships. The human temporal lobe is schematized by way of example. It includes both ventricular zone neural stem cells ( red ), which in turn generate at least three popula- tions of potentially neurogenic transit amplifying progenitors of both neuronal and glial lineages ( yellow ). These include the neuronal progenitor cells of the ventricular subependyma, those of the subgranular zone of the den- tate gyrus, and the white matter progenitor cells (WMPC) of the subcortical parenchyma, which although nomi- nally glial, may remain potentially neurogenic. The latter may be represented in the gray matter parenchyma as well, although the relationships of the parenchymal gray and white matter progenitors have not yet been eluci- dated. Each transit amplifying pool may then give rise to differentiated progeny appropriate to their locations, including neurons ( purple ), oligodendrocytes ( green ) and parenchymal astrocytes ( blue ).

Nonetheless, neurogenesis occurs at only a few discrete and invariant sites, rostrally in the striatal wall and olfactory subependyma, and caudally in the dentate gyrus. In all other regions of the neuraxis, subependy- mal progenitors, despite their neurogenic capacity in vitro , appear to generate glia in vivo . This process is mirrored in lower species, such as the songbird, in which widely dispersed progenitor pools are associated with neurogenesis in only a few discrete brain regions (Goldman, 1998). Across phylogeny then, persistent progenitor cells appear to be tonically inhibited from neuronal production, save for discrete regions of per- missive neurogenesis (Gage, 2000). This paradox of a regional restriction of neurogenesis, despite more widely dispersed if not ubiquitous ventricu- lar zone progenitor pools, has proven highly instructive. Specifically, it led to the concept of permissive niches for neurogenesis, borrowing from the hematopoietic system the concept of permissive niches for both stem cell expansion and phenotypic restriction. At the most basic level, neurogenic (and gliogenic) niches are both estab- lished and defined by reciprocal paracrine interactions between astrocytes, endothelial cells, and ependymal cells. It is the largely humoral products of these interac- tions that appear to determine whether resident precur- sor cells divide at all, and if they do, whether they then give rise to neurons or glia. In most areas of the adult ventricular neuroepithe- lium, astrocyte-derived bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) typically suppress local neurogenesis, by direct- ing astrocytic differentiation from competent neural progenitors (Gross et al. , 1996). In addition, nitric oxide synthase appears to tonically inhibit progenitor turnover in these regions, and its inhibition can mobilize resident progenitors to divide (Packer et al. , 2003). Yet in the specifically neurogenic regions of the adult olfactory stream and hippocampal dentate gyrus, both ependymal cells and progenitors express noggin, a competitive antagonist of the BMPs (Chmielnicki et al. , 2003; Lim et al. , 2000). The local production and parenchymal sequestration of noggin may then permit subependymal neurogenesis, by limiting the access of astrocyte-derived BMPs to neural stem and progenitor cells (Lim et al. , 2000; Paine-Saunders et al. , 2001). In these specifically neurogenic regions, astrocytes also appear to support neurogenesis (Lim and Alvarez-Buylla, 1999; Song et al. , 2002), doing so through both IGF1 (Aberg et al. , 2000; Jiang et al. , 1998) and FGF (Palmer et al. , 1995) receptor-dependent activation of cycling pro- genitors. In addition, astrocyte-released adenosine triphos- phate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP), acting through P2Y G-protein–coupled purine receptors, may mediate glial regulation of mitotic neurogenesis in the adult ventricular zone and hippocampus (Braun et al. , 2003). Thus, astrocytes appear to be elaborating both positive and negative influences on neurogenesis, in a spatial pattern that may be both organized by ependymal noggin, and sustained in part by noggin’s matrix sequestration (Paine-Saunders et al. , 2002). This mechanism may permit the establishment of neurogenic niches not only in the striatal subependyma, but also in the dentate gyrus and olfactory bulb, each of which expresses high levels of noggin protein (Chmielnicki et al. , 2004; Chmielnicki and Goldman, 2002). As such, the distribution and degree of noggin production may be appropriate targets for modulating both the geography and extent of ventricular zone neurogenesis in adult animals (Chmielnickl et al. , 2004). NEUROGENIC NICHES MAY BE DEFINED BY FOCI OF LOCAL ANGIOGENESIS Permissive niches for neurogenesis may be supported by the paracrine interactions of neural precursor cells with the cerebral microvasculature. In the adult hip- pocampus, neuronal progenitor cells are spatially associ- ated with mitotic endothelial cells, in discrete foci of concurrent angiogenesis and neurogenesis (Palmer, 2002; Palmer et al. , 2000). Both endothelial cells and neural progenitors express the VEGFR2/KDR receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Jin et al. , 2002), suggesting that the two phenotypes may be co-activated by stimuli inducing local VEGF secretion or release. Mammalian endothelial cells can express brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which acts as a potent differentiation and survival factor for neu- rons generated from adult subependymal progenitor cells (Ahmed et al. , 1995; Kirschenbaum and Goldman, 1995; Pincus et al. , 1998; Shetty and Turner, 1998). Indeed, human brain endothelial cells can support the migration and survival of neurons arising from cultures of the adult striatal ventricular zone, and their support of ventricular zone neurogenesis can be suppressed by trkB-Fc, a scavenger of secreted BDNF (Leventhal et al. , 1999). It would seem likely that hippocampal angiogenesis might also support local neurogenesis in a BDNF-dependent fashion, although this has yet to be directly demonstrated. Cellular Plasticity of the Adult Human Brain 377 Ch22.qxd 9/2/04 10:21 AM Page 377"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"This concept of endothelial support of adult neuroge- nesis finds additional support in studies of persistent neurogenesis in the adult songbird forebrain, in which angiogenesis per se appears to be a potent trigger for neu- rogenesis and neuronal recruitment. In the neostriatal vocal control nucleus of these animals, testosterone stim- ulates the production and release of VEGF. This local increase in VEGF elicits a burst of mitotic angiogenesis, which is followed by the production of BDNF by the stimulated microvascular cells (Louissaint et al. , 2002). The local release of BDNF then acts as both a migratory and survival cue for neurons departing the VZ, permit- ting their parenchymal integration as new neurons. In this system as well as in the mammalian hippocampus and subependyma (Palmer, 2002), multiple non-neuronal cell types thus collaborate to provide a locally instructive environment for neuronal differentiation. PROGENITOR CELLS PERSIST WITHIN THE BRAIN PARENCHYMA AS WELL AS ITS GERMINAL ZONES Besides the subependymal pools of neurogenic pro- genitors, cycling progenitor cells of apparent glial lineage and fate persist throughout the brain parenchyma. These too may constitute a population of transit amplifying cells, from which astrocytes and oligodendrocytes arise, both tonically and reactively. Remarkably though, at least some of these cycling cells appear to persist as uncommitted progenitors, and are able to generate neu- rons as well as glia once freed from the local environment of the adult white matter (Belachew et al. , 2003; Nunes et al. , 2003; Palmer et al. , 1995). As such, the nominally oligodendrocyte progenitor cells of the adult human brain may now best be viewed as a pool of uncommitted neural progenitor cells, that are biased toward glial pro- duction by their environment, although still fundamen- tally multipotent. Indeed, the very absence of neurogenesis in most regions of the adult brain, despite the ubiquity of neurogenic progenitor cells in the brain parenchyma, argues that the environment of the adult brain actively suppresses neuronal mitogenesis. Instead, most regions of adult brain parenchyma appear to sustain an environ- ment specifically instructive for central gliogenesis, so that gliogenesis is essentially the default fate of adult parenchymal progenitor cells. Transplant studies have supported this point. Spinal progenitors, which although multipotential in vitro are typically gliogenic when implanted back into spinal cord, can generate neurons when transplanted to the pro-neu- rogenic environment of the hippocampus (Horner et al. , 2000). Conversely, highly neurogenic hippocampal and olfactory progenitors typically quickly cease neurogene- sis once transplanted to non-neurogenic regions of brain. Similarly, otherwise neuro genic pro genitor cells implanted into the sublethally irradiated hippocampus generate glia (Monje et al. , 2002; Monje and Palmer, 2003). Thus, the irradiated hippocampus ceases neurogenesis not because of the loss of resident progenitor cells, but rather because radiation appears to render the hippocampal microenvi- ronment nonpermissive for neurogenesis. As such, pro- genitor activation in the irradiated hippocampus yields gliosis rather than neurogenesis, because newly generated cells follow astrocytic rather than neuronal differentia- tion paths. Such is the power of the microenvironment in dictating the differentiated phenotypes of its progeny. GLIA AS NEURAL PROGENITOR CELLS Alvarez-Buylla and colleagues first reported that adult neural stem cells comprised a subpopulation of subependymal glial cells, in which the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter was transcriptionally active (Doetsch et al. , 1999). On this basis, these investigators proposed that neural stem cells were of astrocytic lineage (Alvarez-Buylla and Garcia-Verdugo, 2002; Alvarez- Buylla et al. , 2001). However, it is important to note that neither GFAP promoter activation nor GFAP protein expression are sufficient to define a cell as an astrocyte (Barres, 2003; Goldman, 2003). Rather, astrocytes may best be defined functionally—by their participation in the blood-brain barrier and gliovascular unit, their high- capacity uptake of glutamate, and their strongly hyper- polarized resting membrane potential (Nedergaard et al. , 2003). The antigenic markers that correspond to these functional traits include the water transport molecules aquaporin 4 and 9 (Rash et al. , 1998), the calcium bind- ing protein S100 β , and the glutamate transporters GLAST, EAAT2 and 4 (Anderson and Swanson, 2000). These are all markers of astrocytic phenotype, and yet none has been shown to have a necessary correspondence to GFAP expression patterns, either within the subependyma or otherwise. Thus, if neural stem cells are indeed astrocytes, then one might expect both the aqua- porins and glutamate transporters to be expressed by neural stem cells. Similarly, if neural stem cells were indeed astrocytes, one would expect to identify their ana- tomic relationship with the vasculature, and to see both vascular endfeet and junctional contacts with endothelial cells (Simard et al. , 2003). Although this r emains a topic of active investigation, to date none of these conditions has yet been met in the investigation of neural stem cells of either the fetal or adult brain. Thus, neural stem and pro- genitor cells may include stages during which they express GFAP, without necessarily being astrocytes as rigorously defined. This point remains controversial, as several 378 Cellular Plasticity of the Adult Human Brain Ch22.qxd 9/2/04 10:21 AM Page 378"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"investigators have reported lineage data that would at the very least argue for the lineal derivation of persistent neural stem cells from astrocytic founders (Zhuo et al. , 2001), as well as for the ability of astrocytes to generate a neural stem cell phenotype in vitro (Kondo and Raff, 2000; Laywell et al. , 2000). From the standpoint of clinical therapeutics, the real importance of identifying the phenotype of resident neu- ral stem cells is in defining the precise populations amenable to inductive regeneration, and in identifying the signals that will allow stem cell mobilization and dif- ferentiation without affecting parenchymal glia. Indeed, one might argue that the more similar both subependy- mal and parenchymal progenitor cells are to mature astrocytes, the more narrow will be the therapeutic win- dow for their induction, and the harder it will be to design strategies that will allow their specific mobiliza- tion and directed differentiation without untoward effects on tissue astrocytes—which, after all, are by far the most abundant cell population of the adult brain. PARENCHYMAL GLIAL PROGENITORS INCLUDE MULTIPOTENTIAL PROGENITORS The phenotypic identification of neural stem cells was made more difficult by recent observations that besides the subependymal cell population of the ventricular zone, glial progenitor cells within the brain parenchyma might also have multilineage competence. Such multipo- tential precursor cells were first identified in the parenchyma of the adult rodent brain, as well as in its ventricular lining (Palmer et al. , 1999; Richards et al. , 1992). In the human, analogous pools were found within the cortex (Arsenijevic et al. , 2001) and subcortical white matter (Nunes et al. , 2003). The latter cells in particular, defined as white matter progenitor cells (WMPCs), were initially identified as oligodendrocyte progenitors on the basis of their expression of PDGF α R and the A2B5 epi- tope (Scolding et al. , 1998; Scolding et al. , 1999), their transcriptional activation of the CNP promoter (Roy et al. , 1999), and their predominant differentiation as oligodendrocytes, both in vitro and upon transplantation (Windrem et al. , 2002). Yet upon removal to low-density, serum-free culture, in which the cells are effectively removed from both autocrine and paracrine influences, they generate neurons as well as astrocytes and oligoden- drocytes, and remain propagable for several months in vitro (Nunes et al. , 2003) (Figure 22.2; see also the Color Plate section). In vivo , these cells appear as small, highly ramified cells with thin processes that lack endothelial endfeet or even contact. Most express nestin and the NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, markers of immature neural progenitors, and S100 β , a glial marker expressed by immature cells of both the astro- cytic and oligodendrocytic lineages; most express neither GFAP nor aquaporin, nor do they transcriptionally acti- vate the GFAP promoter, and hence cannot be readily characterized as astroglial (Goldman, 2003). Together, these data suggest that the parenchymal glial progenitor of the adult human white matter, nominally an oligoden- drocyte progenitor cell, is in fact a multipotential neural progenitor cell, restricted to generate glia by virtue of the adult parenchymal environment, and not because of any autonomous lineage commitment. GLIAL PROGENITORS OF THE SUBCORTICAL WHITE MATTER ARE TRANSIT-AMPLIFYING CELLS Importantly, although the parenchymal progenitor cell seems to be fundamentally multipotential, it is subject to replicative senescence and does not express measurable telomerase (Nunes et al. , 2003). As a result, it typically ceases expansion after 3–4 months in vitro , spanning no more than 18 population doublings. In light of its lack of telomerase, its self-limited expansion capacity, and its glial bias despite multilineage competence, the parenchy- mal progenitor cell cannot be considered a parenchymal stem cell. Rather, this phenotype may best be considered a transit-amplifying progenitor of both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Interestingly then, just as the transit- amplifying neuronal precursor of the adult rat ventricular zone may revert to a multipotential state in the presence of EGF (Doetsch et al. , 2002), the dividing glial progeni- tor of the human white matter is similarly able to revert to a multilineal neurogenic precursor. Although this is espe- cially manifest when the cells are expanded in vitro , adult glial progenitor cells may generate neurons as soon as they are removed from the local tissue environment, whether extracted on the basis of CNP promoter activa- tion, A2B5 imm unoselection (Nunes et al. , 2003), or NG2 expression (Belachew et al. , 2003). Accordingly, when freshly sorted parenchymal progenitors were introduced via transuterine xenograft into the fetal rat brain, all neu- ral phenotypes were found to arise in a context-dependent manner (Nunes et al. , 2003). In general terms then, removal of glial progenitor cells from all environmental influences may prove both necessary and sufficient to ensure the appearance of multipotential progenitors in their resultant isolates. As such, one may consider the parenchymal progenitor pool of the adult brain as includ- ing both multipotential and glial-restricted members, the relative proportions and lineage competencies of which are dynamically regulated by the local tissue environment. These observations may suggest a hitherto unappreciated degree of cellular plasticity within the adult brain.

Achieving and then directing this capability to ther- apeutic endpoints may prove a strategy of great import. NON-NEURAL PROGENITORS MAY RARELY CONTRIBUTE TO BRAIN ARCHITECTURE Another challenge ripe with promise is that of using non-neural sources of cells for therapeutic engraftment to the CNS. A number of studies had earlier posited that non-neural progenitor cells, including both bone mar- row– and umbilical cord–derived stromal cells, might be competent to give rise to neurons and glial cells in the adult CNS (Krause, 2001; Mezey et al. , 2000). From these studies arose the concept of trans-differentiation of non-neural progenitors to neural stem cells, and then to neurons and both oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. This issue has engendered considerable controversy, in part due to the methodological limitations of these studies, in which the expression of defined neural markers by donor stromal cells was often viewed as synonymous with func- tional phenotypic trans-differentiation. Yet despite the lack of clear data supporting the differentiation of implanted stromal cells into functionally competent neu- rons and myelinogenic oligodendrocytes, several espe- cially compelling instances of apparent neuronal differentiation from donor stromal cells had begged explanation. These included several reports of cerebellar Purkinje neurons of unmistakable morphology and dis- tribution that expressed genetic tags indicating their der- ivation from stromal donor cells (Priller, 2001; Weimann et al. , 2003). Against this background, studies of hematopoietic and stromal stem cell treatment of hepatic insufficiency then led to the discovery that the fusion of donor stromal cells with resident hepatocytes could lead to the formation of donor-recipient heterokaryons (Vassilopoulos et al. , 2003; Wang, 2003). This might readily have led to the false impression of donor cell dif- ferentiation to nonmesenchymal phenotypes. In a follow-up to these studies, Alvarez-Buylla and colleagues then demonstrated that cerebellar Purkinje neurons, along with both hepatocytes and cardio- myocytes, may be particularly susceptible to such fusion events (Alvarez-Dolado et al. , 2003). As a result, the initial reports of neuronal trans-differentiation from bone marrow stromal cells, including those of Purkinje neuronal differentiation, now appear to have been arti- factual. In retrospect, these reports appear to have been based on fusion events, in which host neurons and glia incorporated the genetic tags imparted by their stromal fusion partners (Ying et al. , 2002). Nonetheless, these studies succeeded in raising the possibility that endoge- nous bone marrow–derived mesenchymal progenitors, once mobilized to the bloodstream, might be able to fuse with autologous CNS partners, thereby conferring new information to resident cells. Whether this occurs in the natural history of either normal adult humans, or in response to disease or injury, is presently unknown. Yet whatever the natural history of fusion events within the CNS, the administration of stromal donor cells for the purpose of fusion-mediated gene delivery to the CNS may prove a useful and broadly applicable thera- peutic strategy. THERAPEUTIC TARGETS FOR IMPLANTED NEURAL PROGENITOR CELLS The potential therapeutic targets of adult progenitor cells are manifold and are the subject of other reviews, both in this volume and elsewhere (Chmielnicki and Goldman, 2002; Goldman et al. , 2002; Goldman et al. , 2001). Briefly, these cells may be viewed as vectors for cell replacement via transplantation, or as targets for the endogenous induction of resident progenitor cells. Whereas the former represents the broad category of cell- based therapy of the nervous system, the latter comprises gene therapeutic approaches to progenitor induction and repair. For cell replacement, neuronal progenitors of rela- tively homogeneous phenotype are just beginning to become available, from both tissue-derived and embry- onic stem cell–derived neural progenitor cells. As both the directed induction (Studer et al. , 2000; Wichterle et al. , 2002) and promoter-based isolation (Keyoung et al. , 2001; Li et al. , 1998; Roy et al. , 2000a; Roy et al. , 1999; Roy et al. , 2000b; Wang et al. , 1998) of therapeutically desired phenotypes become more refined, we may envis- age the acquisition of progenitors for all major pheno- types of the human CNS. Indeed, our ability to do so may be expected to advance in parallel with our growing understanding of the developmental ontogeny of these cells. Such positionally restricted and transmitter-defined neuronal progenitors already appear amenable to non- oncogenic immortalization using telomerase (Roy et al. , 2004), which should anticipate their being generated in clinically useful numbers and purities. As a result, neu- rodegenerative diseases as diverse as Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and Alzheimer’s may prove feasible targets for cell-based therapy, as progenitors restricted to mid- brain dopaminergic, striatal GABAergic, and forebrain cholinergic fate, respectively, become available. As a therapeutic modality, the transplantation of neu- ronal progenitors would seem of greatest potential ther- apeutic efficacy precisely for neurodegenerative diseases Cellular Plasticity of the Adult Human Brain 381 Ch22.qxd 9/2/04 10:21 AM Page 381"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"382 Cellular Plasticity of the Adult Human Brain such as Parkinson’s and Huntington’s, as well as for both the ischemic and metabolic oligodendrocytic disorders, since each of these is largely attributable to the dysfunc- tion or loss of a single neural phenotype. As a corollary to this point, it may be fair to predict that diseases of polyphenotypic loss, such as stroke, trauma, and spinal cord injury, may be far less amenable to cell-based implant strategies, precisely because of the many differ- ent types of cells lost in these processes and our lack of understanding of how to reconstruct vectorially specified neural networks from their constituent cellular elements. Although several studies have reported some degree of benefit from the implantation of undifferentiated neural precursor cells into stroke and traumatic cord injury, none has convincingly demonstrated any restoration of normal microanatomy or structural integrity to these more profound disruptions of neural architecture. Glial pathologies may lend themselves to cell-based therapy even more readily than neuronal disorders, given the relative homogeneity and accessibility of the major glial phenotypes, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, and the abundance of their parental progenitors. As noted, oligo- dendrocyte progenitors may be isolated to purity and used for therapeutic remyelination. This may be done in both adult targets of acquired demyelination (Windrem et al. , 2002), and perinatally in disorders of myelin formation or maintenance, such as the congenital leukodystrophies (Windrem et al. , 2004) (Figure 22.3; see also the Color Plate section). The latter include disorders of gly- cosaminoglycan metabolism such as the mucopolysaccha- ridoses, as well as the gangliosidoses and other lysosomal lipid storage disorders (Kaye, 2001). As a group, these dis- orders may be amenable to astrocyte-mediated cell therapy as well as to oligodendrocyte progenitor-based strategies, because astroglia may be sufficiently migratory in the CNS to ensure the widespread delivery of wild-type enzymes and therapeutic transgenes to recipient brain tissue. From the standpoint of structural repair, as opposed to enzyme replacement and metabolic restitution, disease targets as diverse as the vascular leukoencephalopathies in adults, and cerebral palsy in children, may prove amenable to glial cell–based therapies; each of these disease categories is predominantly characterized by glial loss. Indeed, one may expect rapid clinical translation of glial cell–based therapy, as more is learned of the disease stages and attendant ther- apeutic windows at which human glial progenitor cell transplants may be most effectively used. THE THERAPEUTIC INDUCTION OF ENDOGENOUS PROGENITOR CELLS Our emphasis here on cell therapy–based repair reflects the reality that most studies in restorative neurol- ogy of the past decade have focused on the use of trans- planted neurons and glia, and more recently of stem and progenitor cells, as therapeutic agents. Relatively less effort has been devoted to using or mobilizing endoge- nous progenitor populations. Yet as we have discussed, several major populations of accessible progenitor popu- lations persist in the adult brain, including that of the human. These pools are individually accessible, and may be mobilized through a variety of both pharmacological and gene therapeutic strategies that result in the mitotic expansion of resident stem and progenitor cells. Epidermal and fibroblast growth factors (Craig et al. , 1996; Kuhn et al. , 1996; Kuhn et al. , 1997), tumor growth factor– α (Fallon et al. , 2000), nitric oxide synthase inhi- bitors (Packer et al. , 2003), insulin-like growth factor (Aberg et al. , 2000), BDNF (Benraiss et al. , 2001; Pencea et al. , 2001), and noggin (Chmielnicki et al. , 2004; Chmielnicki and Goldman, 2002), among others, have each been shown to mobilize endogenous subependymal progenitor cell populations. Parenchymal glial progeni- tors have also been the target of mobilization strategies, a prominent goal of which has been the induction of oligoneogenesis for induced remyelination of demye- linated foci (Levine et al. , 2001). Parallel studies have sought to generate therapeutically useful neuronal popu- lations from r esident parenchymal progenitors; for exam- ple, dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons from parenchymal progenitors of the adult substantia nigra (Zhao et al. , 2003). Such studies have been predicated on the logic that progenitors may be destined, by virtue of early ho- meodomain encoding, to give rise to neurons appropriate to the area of CNS from which those progenitors are derived. For instance, neural stem cells derived from the ventral mesencephalic ventricular zone appear biased toward dopaminergic neurogenesis (Sawamoto et al. , 2001). In addition, discrete subpopulations of progeni- tors competent to give rise to specific neuronal pheno- types, such as the striatal or dentate neuronal progenitor populations, may be stimulated through the use of cognate growth factors, whether delivered as purified proteins or gene therapeutics. For instance, viral overex- pression of BDNF may be used to stimulate generation of new medium spiny neurons (Benraiss et al. , 2001; Chmielnicki et al. , 2004; Chmielnicki and Goldman, 2002), a possible therapeutic strategy in Huntington’s disease. Such strategies of inducing resident progenitor cells to regenerate those neuronal and glial cell popula- tions lost to specific diseases have only begun to bear fruit experimentally. Realistically, a great number of both conceptual and operational hurdles must be overcome before induced neurogenesis can be considered a practi- cal or imminently feasible therapeutic option.

It was long believed that the predominant repair mechanisms did not extend beyond postmitotic events, such as sprouting of axon ter- minals, changes in neurotransmitter-receptor expression and synaptic reorganization. The generation of new neu- rons in the adult brain was reported for the first time in the mid-1960s. Using tritiated thymidine autoradiogra- phy, Altman and Das found that dividing cells survived in the adult brain and generated cells with the morpho- logical characteristics of neurons (Altman and Das, 1965). Over subsequent years, Altman and his colleagues continued to provide evidence for this phenomenon. However, due to technical restrictions, such as the lack of definitive phenotypic markers, and conceptual con- straints posed by the existing dogma that denied the pos- sibility of regeneration in the adult CNS, the idea of adult mammalian neurogenesis was met with major skep- ticism and enthusiasm remained low. Several years later, Kaplan and colleagues revisited the idea and provided strong ultrastructural evidence for the neuronal identity of newly generated cells in the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus, one of the regions where neurogenesis persists into adulthood (Kap lan and Hinds, 1977). In the mid-1980s, the developing field of adult neurogenesis was further stim- ulated by the work of Nottebohm and co-workers, who studied seasonal neuronal cell death and generation of new neurons in the adult canary brain and postulated that this process was involved in the acquisition of new memory (Goldman and Nottebohm, 1983). At the beginning of the 1990s, the focus of the field shifted back from adult avian neurogenesis to mammalian systems . Technical advances, such as the characterization and visualization of newborn neurons by newly developed markers and the ability to isolate, propagate, and manipulate cells that are consid- ered to be the origin of the newly generated neurons, have fueled the progress in this field (reviewed in Gage, 2000). And although the basic mechanisms of adult mammalian neurogenesis are far from understood, recent suggestions of a potential to generate new neurons in lesioned areas of the adult brain have raised our hopes that, in the future, we might be able to use this process to repair the diseased CNS. NEURAL STEM CELLS ARE POTENTIALLY PRESENT THROUGHOUT THE ADULT MAMMALIAN CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM During development of the mammalian CNS, neu- rons and glia arise from immature proliferating cells in a stereotypical sequence: first neurons are generated, pri- marily during the embryonic period, followed by glia, the majority of which differentiate after most neurons are born. Within the developing CNS the most immature cell in this lineage is the neural stem cell. Neural stem cells are defined as cells that have the ability to self-renew and to give rise to the three major cell types of the CNS: neu- rons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Progenitor cells are defined as cells that are lineage-restricted and/or show limited proliferative capacity. Through a sequence of symmetric and asymmetric divisions, in which neural stem cells give rise to lineage-restricted cells which, in turn, differentiate into mature CNS cells, the major CNS 387 CHAPTER 23 Harnessing Endogenous Stem Cells for Central Nervous System Repair D.

In contrast to the hematopoietic system, in which stem and lineage-restricted progenitor cells can be iden- tified and prospectively isolated based on their expres- sion of different cell surface antigens, there are no markers that will unequivo cally identify stem or progeni- tor cells in the adult CNS (Weissman et al. , 2001). Thus these cell types are currently identified in retrospect, based on their behavior after isolation, expansion, and manipulation in vitro . Cells that can be propagated in the presence of mitogens, such as fibroblast growth factor 2 and/or epidermal growth factor, have been isolated from multiple adult CNS regions, including the cortex, spinal cord, substantia nigra, and hippocampus of many differ- ent mammalian species, including humans (Reynolds and Weiss, 1992; Gage et al. , 1995; Palmer et al. , 1995; Weiss et al. , 1996; Palmer et al. , 1997; Johansson et al. , 1999b; Johansson et al. , 1999a; Palmer et al. , 1999; Arsenijevic et al. , 2001b; Palmer et al. , 2001; Yamamoto et al. , 2001; Lie et al. , 2002; Nunes et al. , 2003). Analysis of the dif- ferentiation potential of cells cultured under these con- ditions has shown that these cells are able to give rise to neurons and glia. Moreover, analysis of the fate of sin- gle cells and their progeny (i.e, clonal analysis) has revealed that some cells in these cultures are multipo- tent, with the potential to differentiate into all three CNS lineages. These findings suggest that adult neural stem cells are present throughout the entire neuraxis. One caveat to this interpretation, however, is that prolif- erating cells derived from the adult CNS have been pri- marily analyzed after expansion in the presence of high concentrations of mitogens that can potentially lead to changes in the characteristics of the isolated cells (Palmer et al. , 1997; Palmer et al. , 1999; Kondo and Raff, 2000). Thus, the observed differentiation pattern might not reflect the potential that the cells have in vivo . Therefore, future studies need to focus on the develop- ment of strategies to identify and prospectively isolate pure populations of potential candidates for neural stem cells, making it possible to investigate the differentiation potential of these populations without prior exposure to mitogens. Recently, protocols have been developed that allow the enrichment of adult CNS-derived proliferating cells in culture, thereby allowing in vitro characterization soon after isolation (Palmer et al. , 1999; Rietze et al. , 2001). In vitro studies using these methods have con- firmed that in vivo proliferating cells from gliogenic regions have the ability to give rise to neurons in culture without exposure to growth factors/mitogens (Lie et al. , 2002), thereby providing additional support for the idea of a broad presence of neural stem cells in the adult mammalian CNS. NEUROGENESIS IS RESTRICTED TO SPECIALIZED AREAS OF THE ADULT BRAIN Dividing cells and their progeny can be labeled by injection of 3H-thymidine or of the thymidine analog bro- modeoxyuridine (BrdU). Both markers will be incorpo- rated into the DNA of dividing cells during S-Phase and will be passed on to the progeny of these cells. 3H-thymidine can then be visualized by autoradiography, and BrdU can be detected by immunostaining. With use of these methods, dividing cells have been found along the entire neuraxis (Kaplan and Hinds, 1980; Kuhn et al. , 1997; Horner et al. , 2000; Lie et al. , 2002). Consistent with the possibility of isolating proliferating cells with stem cell characteristics from many regions of the adult CNS, the majority of the dividing cells express proteins that, during development or in culture, are associated with neural stem cells, for example, nestin, or lineage-restricted progen- itor cells, for example, NG2, suggesting that neural stem 388 Endogenous Stem Cells and CNS Repair FIGURE 23.1 Model for the generation of differentiated neural cells from stem cells. Multipotent, self-renewing neural stem cells generate progeny with restricted proliferation and differentiation potential (i.e., progenitor cells).

What is the fate of the dividing cells in the adult CNS? Do they generate differentiated neural progeny in the adult CNS? The use of BrdU in combination with markers for differentiated neural cells allows us to phenotype the prog- eny of dividing cells in the CNS. In most areas of the adult CNS, dividing cells give rise to new astrocytes and oligo- dendrocytes (Kuhn et al. , 1997; Horner et al. , 2000; Lie et al. , 2002). However, in two restricted areas of the adult CNS, the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal den- tate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle, new neurons arise from neural stem cells through the generation of rapidly dividing progenitor cells and through differentiation of these progenitor cells into imma- ture neurons (reviewed in Kempermann and Gage, 2000; Alvarez-Buylla and Garcia-Verdugo, 2002) (Figure 23.2; see also the Color Plate section). Many of the immature neurons born in the SGZ die within the first 2 weeks after birth. The surviving neurons migrate into the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and differentiate into granule neurons (Kempermann et al. , 2003). Within 1 month, they send axonal projections into the CA3 region and project dendrites into the outer molecular layer in a way that is similar to the pre-existing dentate granule neurons (Hastings and Gould, 1999; Markakis and Gage, 1999; Seri et al. , 2001; van Praag et al. , 2002). Immature neurons born in the SVZ migrate long dis- tances through the rostral migratory pathway (RMP) towards the olfactory bulb. In the RMP, new neurons form chains and migrate through tubular structures formed by specialized astrocytes (Lois et al. , 1996; Wichterle et al. , 1997). Around 2 weeks after birth, the first neurons have reached the olfactory bulb and start to migrate radially to their final positions in the glomerular and periglomerular layers, where they differentiate into interneurons (Winner et al. , 2002; Carleton et al. , 2003). Due to the development of new techniques that allow the labeling of new neurons with live-cell markers, the electrophysiological properties of new neurons in the hip- pocampus and the olfactory bulb can now be examined. Recent studies have shown that new neurons in both areas display the electrophysiological properties of mature neu- rons, such as the ability to generate action potentials and receive synaptic input (van Praag et al. , 2002; Carleton et al. , 2003). These important studies indicate that the new neurons are functional and suggest that they are integrated into the existing circuitry. The function of adult neurogenesis is currently not known. It has been proposed that, because neurons in the dentate gyrus and the olfactory bulb undergo pro- grammed cell death, the new neurons compensate for this continued cell loss (Biebl et al. , 2000; Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002). Correlative evidence suggests that new hippocampal neurons are involved in spatial learning and memory (reviewed in Kempermann, 2002), whereas new olfactory interneurons might contribute to olfactory discrimination (Gheusi et al. , 2000; Petreanu and Alvarez- Buylla, 2002). It has been suggested that new neurons are also born in other areas of the adult brain, such as the cortex (Gould et al. , 1999a) and the substantia nigra (Zhao et al. , 2003). However, these findings are controversial and currently lack confirmation (Kay and Blum, 2000; Kornack and Rakic, 2001; Lie et al. , 2002).

Transplantation of neural stem/progenitor cells derived from neurogenic (hippocampus) or non- neurogenic (spinal cord, substantia nigra) regions of the adult brain have provided evidence for the role of envi- ronmental factors in the neuronal differentiation of adult neural stem cells. When transplanted into neurogenic regions, neural stem cells from adult neurogenic and gli- ogenic CNS regions give rise to neurons in vivo . In con- trast, when transplanted into gliogenic regions, adult neural stem cells, regardless of their origin, will differen- tiate into glial cells (Suhonen et al. , 1996; Shihabuddin et al. , 2000; Lie et al. , 2002). These findings indicate that adult neural stem cells from different regions are not fate-restricted by intrinsic programs but that extrinsic cues derived from the local environment control their differentiation. Cellular Elements Regulating Neurogenesis What are the cellular elements that control the prolif- eration and fate choice of neural stem cells? Functional studies in songbirds and anatomical studies in rodents have implied that vasculature plays an important role in providing a neurogenic environment. Stem/progenitor cells in the hippocampus, but not in non-neurogenic regions, proliferate in close proximity to blood vessels and dividing endothelial cells, suggesting that common signals, probably derived from the vasculature, regulate neurogenesis and vasculogenesis (Palmer et al. , 2000). Indeed factors that promote endothelial cell proliferation also increase neurogenesis, further indicating an impor- tant relationship between these two processes (Jin et al. , 2002). In the adult songbird brain, a recent study showed Endogenous Stem Cells and CNS Repair 389 Ch23.qxd 9/2/04 10:23 AM Page 389"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"that increased vasculogenesis stimulates neurogenesis by an increase in endothelial cell–derived growth factors (Louissaint et al. , 2002). In the SVZ, neural stem and progenitor cells prolifer- ate and differentiate into immature neurons in proximity to ependymal cells. Ependymal cells have been shown to contribute to the neurogenic environment in the SVZ by secreting factors that inhibit glial differentiation of neu- ral stem cells (Lim et al. , 2000) (see subsequent discus sion). Astrocytes are also in intimate contact with proliferating stem and progenitor cells in the SVZ and the SGZ. Astrocytes in the hippocampus and the SVZ provide sig- nals that not only stimulate the proliferation of neural stem cells but also instruct these cells to adopt a neuronal fate (Lim and Alvarez-Buylla, 1999; Song et al. , 2002). Interestingly, astrocytes from non-neurogenic regions such as the adult spinal cord do not stimulate the neu- ronal differentiation of neural stem cells. These findings 390 Endogenous Stem Cells and CNS Repair FIGURE 23.2 Neurogenic zones of the adult mammalian CNS. A: Hippocampal dentate gyrus. 1.

Molecular Regulation of Neurogenesis The molecular mechanisms that control adult neuro- genesis are poorly understood. Multiple growth factors, hormones, and neurotransmitters have been implicated in the regulation of neurogenesis, based on their ability to influence proliferation, differentiation, and survival of neural stem cells in vitro and in vivo . The relationship between these different factors is currently not under- stood and it is not clear whether all of them play a phys- iological role in the regulation of neurogenesis. However, given their potential to affect the behavior of neural stem cells in vivo , these factors and their receptors might represent candidate molecules and targets, respectively, for the recruitment of endogenous stem cells for CNS repair. Factors Affecting Proliferation Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor–2 (FGF-2) are commonly used as mito- gens for the maintenance of neural stem cells in vitro (reviewed in Gage, 2000). Intracerebroventricular infu- sion of either factor increases the proliferation of cells in the SVZ but not in the hippocampus (Kuhn et al. , 1997; Wagner et al. , 1999). Other growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Jin et al. , 2002), Sonic hedgehog (SHH) (Lai et al. , 2003), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Benraiss et al. , 2001; Pencea et al. , 2001), insulin-like growth fac- tor–1 (IGF-1) (Aberg et al. , 2000; Arsenijevic et al. , 2001a), FGF-8 (Lie et al. , 2002), and Amphiregulin (Falk and Frisen, 2002), have also been shown to be suf- ficient to propagate neural stem cells in vitro or to enhance proliferation in vivo . Currently, there is no direct evidence that any of these growth factors is an endogenous regulator of neural stem cell proliferation.

Factors Controlling Fate Specification of Adult Neural Stem Cells To date, only a few factors have been identified that control the fate of adult neural stem cells. Activated Notch 1 and Notch 3 have been found to restrict adult neural stem cells toward an astroglial lineage in vitro (Tanigaki et al. , 2001). In addition, members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family instruct adult neu- ral stem cells to adopt a glial cell fate (Lim et al. , 2000). Interestingly BMPs are expressed by adult neural stem cells themselves. This autocrine gliogenic signal is inhib- ited by noggin, a secreted protein that blocks BMP sig- naling by binding to BMPs. In the neurogenic SVZ, noggin is secreted by ependymal cells in the lateral ven- tricle, thereby blocking the gliogenic effects of BMPs and permitting neuronal differentiation of adult neural stem cells. However, blocking of BMP by itself is not sufficient to induce the neuronal differentiation of adult neural stem cells; that requires additional factors, potentially derived from local astrocytes. There are currently no physiological inducers of neu- ronal cell fate known. In vitro , differentiation of adult neural stem cells into all three neural lineages is induced by withdrawal of mitogens. The neuronal differentiation can be enhanced by retinoic acid and increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels (Palmer et al. , 1997; Takahashi et al. , 1999; Nakagawa et al. , 2002). In addition, neurotrophins have limited influence on the neurotransmitter phenotype expressed in vitro (Takahashi et al. , 1999). In vivo , increased generation of neurons has been observed following infusion/overexpression of BDNF (Benraiss et al. , 2001; Pencea et al. , 2001) and IGF-1 (Aberg et al. , 2000). However, it is not clear whether this increase is caused by enhanced neuronal differ entia- tion of adult neural stem cells or by enhanced survival of new neurons. Neuronal Migration, Nerve Guidance, Synapse Formation, and Survival Factors controlling later steps in neurogenesis, such as functional maturation, synapse formation and integra- tion into the neuronal circuit and survival, are currently unknown. Some mechanisms and molecules that control the remarkable long-distance migration of newly gener- ated neurons through RMP have been described. Migrating neurons interact with their environment through expression of the polysialated glycoprotein neu- ral cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), which is essen- tial for proper migration, as a null mutation for NCAM or the deletion of the polysialic acid moiety results in migratory defects (Ono et al. , 1994; Rousselot et al. , 1995). Interactions via integrins between migrating neu- rons themselves (Jacques et al. , 1998), as well as environ- ment-derived short- and long-range chemorepulsive factors such as members of the ephrin-B family (Conover et al. , 2000) and Slit (Wu et al. , 1999), have also been demonstrated to direct the migration through the rostral migratory pathway. Influence of Genetics and Behavior on Neurogenesis Interestingly, genetic background and behavioral modifications influence the rate of neurogenesis. Mouse strains differ significantly in their baseline rate of neuro- genesis, due to differences in proliferation, differentiation and survival of newly generated cells (Kempermann et al. , 1997a). In addition, the strain differences influence how neurogenesis is affected by environmental factors. Thus, exposure to an enriched environment consisting of toys, larger housing, and opportunity for learning, social interaction, and physical activity was shown to signifi- cantly increase hippocampal neurogenesis by enhancing the survival of new neurons (Kempermann et al. , 1997b). In a different mouse strain, the same environment stimulated hippocampal neurogenesis by increasing proliferation (Kempermann et al. , 1997b). With respect to the stimulation of hippocampal neurogenesis, increased physical activity appears to be the most important component of the enriched environ- ment (van Praag et al. , 1999). The suggestion that neurogenesis is stimulated by spatial learning, a hip- pocampus-dependent task, remains controversial. Although one laboratory reported an increased rate of neurogenesis in animals exposed to a spatial learning task due to enhanced survival of newborn neurons (Gould et al. , 1999b), our group has not found any evi- dence for enhanced neurogenesis in the context of this task (van Praag et al. , 1999). Neurogenesis in the SVZ/olfactory bulb is not affected by running and enriched environment (Brown et al. , 2003). However, odor enrichment, that is, exposure to an environment with daily changing sources of odor (Rochefort et al. , 2002), stimulates neurogenesis in this system, indicating that specific environmental and behav- ioral stimuli differentially influence neural stem cell 392 Endogenous Stem Cells and CNS Repair Ch23.qxd 9/2/04 10:23 AM Page 392"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"behavior in the two neurogenic areas. Whether this dif- ferential effect is due to locally specific expression of common molecular regulators for both regions or to region-specific responsiveness of stem cells to broadly expressed factors remains to be determined. Although the immediate molecular consequences of running, enriched environment, and odor enrichment are only poorly characterized, the finding that certain behav- ioral modifications can specifically increase the rate of neurogenesis in defined CNS areas may be important for future CNS repair strategies, potentially in combination with defined pharmacological therapies. ADULT NEURAL STEM CELLS AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM REPAIR Due to their ability to proliferate and to give rise to differentiated progeny, stem cells are considered promis- ing candidates for use in the treatment of currently intractable diseases. Cell replacement therapy has been pursued in Parkinson’s disease over the past three decades, involving transplantation of primarily fetus- derived midbrain dopaminergic precursors (Lindvall and Hagell, 2001). More recently, methods have been devel- oped that allow the directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells into different neural subtypes that can be used for exogenous cell replacement strategies in CNS diseases (Kim et al. , 2002). However, the use and manipulation of fetal tissue and embryonic stem cells have raised a num- ber of ethical concerns and political restrictions. These restrictions do not apply to the use of endogenous adult neural stem cells for cell replacement therapy. In addi- tion, these cells offer a unique advantage over other, exogenous cell sources: immunological reactions are avoided. However, the mobilization of endogenous neural stem cells for cell replacement poses multiple problems that need to be overcome. ENDOGENOUS NEURAL STEM CELLS IN DISEASE AND LESION MODELS The recruitment of endogenous neural stem cells for cellular replacement was initially observed in neurogenic regions. A broad variety of lesions lead to transient increases in cell proliferation in the SGZ and in the rate of hippocampal neurogenesis. Similarly, precursor cell proliferation in the SVZ and the number of migrating neurons in the RMP are temporarily augmented in defined lesion paradigms. Limited de novo neurogenesis in a region that under physiological circumstances is non-neurogenic was observed for the first time in a lesion model with no direct clinical correlate (Magavi et al. , 2000). This partic- ular model is based on the photoactivation of a chro- mophore, which results in the generation of reactive oxygen species that in turn lead to apoptotic cell death. Following induced apoptosis of neocortical neurons by this method, approximately 2% of the newborn cells in the lesioned neocortex expressed neuronal markers. These new neurons not only survived for at least 6 months but also appeared to have formed appropriate, long-distance projections. These data suggested for the first time that new neurons could potentially contribute to repair in non-neurogenic regions. Following this report, there has been a growing num- ber of reports of neurogenesis in multiple CNS regions in models for human diseases. DISEASE MODELS IN WHICH POTENTIAL NEUROGENESIS HAS BEEN DESCRIBED Seizures Seizures induce neuronal cell death in various CNS regions. Increased precursor proliferation and neuronal differentiation have been observed following chemocon- vulsant-induced seizure in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the SVZ/olfactory bulb system (reviewed in Parent and Lowenstein, 2002), indicating that increased neurogenesis might contribute to repair by compensation of seizure-induced neuronal cell death in these circuits. However, some new neurons displayed abnormal migra- tory behavior and were found in ectopic locations (Parent et al. , 1997; Parent et al. , 2002a). Moreover, they con- tributed to aberrant network organization and in some cases showed altered physiological properties (Parent et al. , 1997; Scharfman et al. , 2000). Ischemic Brain Insults Global forebrain ischemia, a model for cardiac arrest or coronary artery occlusion, leads to selective death of defined vulnerable neuronal populations. In contrast to other hippocampal structures, such as the CA1 region, the dentate gyrus is relatively resistant to this insult. Interestingly, several groups have found that global fore- brain ischemia promotes progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus (Liu et al. , 1998; Kee et al. , 2001; Yagita et al. , 2001), suggesting that the resistance of the dentate gyrus formation to global ischemia is related to its ability to generate new dentate granule neurons to replace degenerating ones. Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) is a commonly used stroke model that causes infarction in the striatum and the parietal cortex. Under physiological Endogenous Stem Cells and CNS Repair 393 Ch23.qxd 9/2/04 10:23 AM Page 393"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"circumstances, no neurogenesis is observed in these two regions. Following MCAO, however, several laboratories have observed newborn, immature neurons in the infarcted striatum as early as 2 weeks after ischemia (Arvidsson et al. , 2002; Parent et al. , 2002b). Interestingly, at this early time point, the majority of these neurons expressed markers of developing striatal neurons, sug- gesting that they were differentiating into the neuronal phenotype that was destroyed and that they might be able to contribute to cell replacement and repair following striatal infarction. The observations as to whether de novo cortical neu- rogenesis occurs following stroke are inconsistent. It has been reported that new cells are generated in the cortex following photothrombotic lesion or MCAO (Gu et al. , 2000; Jiang et al. , 2001; Zhang et al. , 2001). One group reported that, preferentially in the peri-infarct area, some new cells expressed markers consistent with a neu- ronal phenotype (Gu et al. , 2000). However, studies from other laboratories failed to observe this phenome- non (Zhang et al. , 2001; Arvidsson et al. , 2002; Parent et al. , 2002b). Parkinson’s Disease Model 6-Hydroxydopamine and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6, tetrahydropyridine are neurotoxins that can induce the rapid death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Due to their relative specificity for the dopaminergic system, these toxins are commonly used to create animal models for Parkinson’s disease. Both lesions enhance the appearance of newborn cells in the substantia nigra (Kay and Blum, 2000; Lie et al. , 2002; Zhao et al. , 2003). One study reported increased dopaminergic neurogenesis following MPTP lesion and also suggested a basal turnover of dopaminergic neurons with constant dopaminergic cell death and dopaminergic neurogenesis under physiological conditions (Zhao et al. , 2003). However, other laboratories have not found any evidence for local neurogenesis following degeneration of neurons in the substantia nigra (Kay and Blum, 2000; Lie et al. , 2002). Glial Cell Replacement in Lesion Models In addition to degenerating neurons, glial cells are potentially regenerated following lesion. In human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, sponta- neous partial remyelination of lesions has been observed (Prineas et al. , 1993). Demyelinating lesions can be induced in animals by lysolecithin injection. In these lesions, new myelinating oligodendrocytes are generated from immature, locally dividing cells, suggesting that remyelination in multiple sclerosis is potentially achieved by recruitment of endogenous neural stem/progenitor cells (Gensert and Goldman, 1997). Increased prolifera- tion of local stem/progenitor cells and enhanced gen- eration of new astrocytes have been observed following traumatic lesions in the spinal cord (Johansson et al. , 1999b; Yamamoto et al. , 2001). Whether these cells are contributing to repair or are actually inhibitory for regenerative processes such as the growth of axons is currently not known. RESTRICTIONS ON REGENERATION FROM ENDOGENOUS NEURAL STEM/PROGENITOR CELLS The observation that new neurons and glial cells are generated in some CNS regions following injury suggests a potential for self-repair in the adult CNS by cell replace- ment from endogenous stem cells. Thus far, however, the extent of de novo neurogenesis that has been described is very limited, and in some lesion models, for example, spinal cord injury, no de novo neurogenesis has been found. The restrictions on repair by neural stem cells in the adult CNS are highlighted in the study by Arvidsson and colleagues (Arvidsson et al. , 2002), who studied neuronal cell replacement following ischemia by MCAO. In this study, neuronal replacement was observed in the ischemic striatum but not in the ischemic cortex, suggesting that potential differences exist in the regenerative capacity of different CNS regions. The percentage of replaced striatal neurons was estimated at 0.2%, a rate probably too low to have a significant impact on functional recovery. Several factors contribute to this restricted neuronal replacement. First, the initial number of new neurons observed within the first 2 weeks after ischemia was already very low compared to the number of neurons lost, suggesting that there is insufficient proliferation or neuronal fate commitment of neural stem cells. Second, a large proportion of newborn neurons die, and only 20% of the initially generated new neurons in the post- ischemia striatum survive longer than 14 days. Third, only half of these new neurons appear to differentiate into a mature striatal phenotype. Fourth, the majority of new neurons appear to be derived from stem cells in the SVZ that have migrated into the ischemic striatum, not from resident striatal stem/progenitor cells, suggesting that resident stem cells were also compromised by the lesion. These findings illustrate that the process of lesion- induced neurogenesis is inhibited at multiple levels, including proliferation of stem cells, neuronal fate com- mitment, survival, and maturation of newborn neurons. In addition, the important questions of whether the new neurons are functional and integrate into neuronal circuits remain unanswered. 394 Endogenous Stem Cells and CNS Repair Ch23.qxd 9/2/04 10:23 AM Page 394"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"STIMULATORY AND INHIBITORY FACTORS FOR LESION-INDUCED NEUROGENESIS What signals stimulate de novo neurogenesis in lesioned areas? And what are the factors that limit the extent of lesion-induced neurogenesis? While the exact identity of the molecular signals underlying stimulation and inhibi- tion of lesion-induced neurogenesis are not known, stud- ies in related fields have provided some insight into the potential origin and nature of these factors. A number of signals regulating proliferation, neuronal migration, differentiation, survival, and connectivity dur- ing embryogenesis are reactivated in the injured adult environment. Interneurons surrounding dying neurons in the adult neocortex show increased expression of neu- rotrophins (Wang et al. , 1998) and glial cells in diseased areas can acquire properties of radial glia (Leavitt et al. , 1999), which act as a substrate for neuronal migration during development. Moreover, an increased expression of mitogens for neural precursor cells is found in some lesions (Yoshimura et al. , 2001; Jin et al. , 2002). Transplantation of fetal immature neurons and neona- tal and adult neural stem cells has been used to probe the lesioned environment of the adult CNS for its ability to recruit neural precursor cells for neuronal cell replacement. These experiments have shown that, in some specialized lesion models, the environment is providing signals that are sufficient to stimulate the migration of transplanted fetal- and neonatal-derived precursor cells toward the lesioned area, their differentiation into neurons, and the establish- ment of synaptic contacts (Hernit-Grant and Macklis, 1996; Snyder et al. , 1997; Shin et al. , 2000; Fricker-Gates et al. , 2002). In contrast, glial differentiation, but not neu- ronal differentiation, of transplanted adult neural stem cells has been observed in the lesion models tested so far (Vroemen et al. , 2003) (Dziewczapolski et al. , 2003), sug- gesting that environment-derived signals that can recruit adult neural stem cells are limited or that inhibitory factors for adult neural stem cells are predominant. In acute injuries such as stroke and spinal cord injury, factors that promote reactive gliosis and scar formation are up-regulated, and it is possible that they prevent neuronal differentiation of endogenous stem cells by promoting their glial fate choice (for review see Horner and Gage, 2000). The inhibitory effects of the glial scar (Stichel and Muller, 1998; Zuo et al. , 1998; Pasterkamp et al. , 1999), of extra- cellular matrix molecules (Haas et al. , 1999; Jaworski et al. , 1999; Lemons et al. , 1999; Jones and Tuszynski, 2002; Jones et al. , 2002) and of myelin-derived factors such as Nogo, MAG, and OMgp (Domeniconi et al. , 2002; Liu et al. , 2002; Wang et al. , 2002a; Wang et al. , 2002b) on axonal outgrowth and regeneration in spinal cord injury are well documented. It is possible that the same fac- tors interfere with the formation of functional synaptic connec tions of newborn neurons and their integration into existing circuits, thereby depriving them of target-derived trophic support and decreasing their survival rate. Given that axonal outgrowth and cell migration share similar pathways (Park et al. , 2002), these inhibitory factors might also interfere with the migration of stem cells/immature neurons into the lesion. ENHANCING THE RECRUITMENT OF ENDOGENOUS STEM CELLS FOR REPAIR How can we overcome these hurdles and augment the repair from endogenous stem cells? Given our incomplete knowledge of how adult cell genesis is regulated under physiological conditions, and of what factors are pro- moting or inhibiting lesion-induced cell genesis, it is dif- ficult currently to devise logical strategies to enhance this process. Nevertheless, recent studies have suggested that some growth factors might be able to either promote neu- rogenesis in otherwise gliogenic regions or enhance the repair from neural stem cells. BDNF delivery to the adult forebrain by either contin- uous infusion or adenoviral overexpression in the ependy- mal layer has been shown to result in enhanced proliferation in the SVZ and increased addition of neu- rons in the olfactory bulb, demonstrating that BDNF stimulates neurogenesis in the SVZ/olfactory bulb system in vivo (Benraiss et al. , 2001; Pencea et al. , 2001). Interestingly, in these studies the appearance of poten- tially newborn neurons in the striatum, septum, and hypothalamus was described in BDNF-treated animals but not in controls. Some of the newborn cells in the stria- tum also appeared to have differentiated into mature stri- atal spiny neurons, suggesting that BDNF might not only have the potential to recruit stem cells for neurogenesis in otherwise gliogenic regions but might also support their differentiation into region-specific phenotypes. The effects of growth factors on regeneration from endogenous stem cells have also been tested in lesion models. In 6-OHDA-lesioned animals, transforming growth factor α (TGF α ) infusion into the striatal parenchyma concomitant with or 2 weeks after the lesion leads to behavioral recovery (Fallon et al. , 2000). Moreover, increased proliferation of precursor cells, migration from the SVZ toward the striatum, and differ- entiation into new dopaminergic neurons in the striatum were described in the TGF α -treated animals but not in the control animals. Based on these results, the authors concluded that TGF α , in conjunction with signals aris- ing from injury, recruited endogenous stem cells to gen- erate new dopaminergic neurons in the striatum, which restored dopaminergic neurotransmission and caused behavioral recovery.

In rodents, this lesion produces selective degeneration of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Growth factor–treated animals, how- ever, showed approximately 40% recovery of the total number of CA1 pyramidal neurons lost by ischemia (Figure 23.3; see also the Color Plate section). BrdU labeling, retroviral lineage tracing, and inhibition of pro- liferation by administration of an antimitotic dr ug shortly after the lesion provided evidence that a large number of the recovered pyramidal neurons were generated de novo in response to the combination of growth factor treat- ment and lesion (Figure 23.4; see also the Color Plate section). Moreover, some data suggested that these neu- rons were derived from progenitor cells in the periven- tricular region that had migrated into the lesioned CA1 region. Importantly, in this study evidence was also found that functional synapses were formed onto the regenerated neurons and that growth factor–treated ani- mals performed significantly better in spatial learning tasks, suggesting that the recovered pyramidal neurons were participating in the hippocampal circuitry and contributed to behavioral recovery. Recovery of CNS function through recruitment of endogenous stem cells has also been suggested in aged animals.

Similar to their effects in young animals, FGF-2 and EGF infusion can significantly increase cell proliferation in the SGZ and SVZ in aged rodents (Jin et al. , 2003). In addition, it has been demonstrated that exposure to an enriched environ- ment increases the rate of hippocampal neurogenesis by approximately fivefold and is accompanied by improved performance in spatial learning tasks (Kempermann et al. , 1998; Kempermann et al. , 2002). While the molec- ular consequences of environmental enrichment are far from understood, these findings present us with the intriguing possibility that behavioral and environmental influences in conjunction with growth factor delivery could be beneficial for the recruitment of adult neural stem cells for CNS repair. CAVEATS: THE NEED TO LINK NEW NEURONS TO RECOVERY The observation that endogenous stem cells can be recruited to generate new neurons following lesion is highly exciting and reinforces our efforts to develop strategies that aim at harnessing endogenous stem cells for repair of the adult CNS. However, the observation that new neurons generated in response to epileptic injury in the hippocampus can be found in heterotopic locations (Parent et al. , 1997; Parent et al. , 2002a), can contribute to aberrant networks (Parent et al. , 1997), and can show altered physiological properties (Scharfman et al. , 2000) reminds us that the uncontrolled generation of new neurons can also cause pathology (Parent and Lowenstein, 2002). Moreover, the contribution of new neurons to repair and functional improvement has not been unequivocally demonstrated but has been assumed, primarily based on correlations of morphological and behavioral data. The study by Nakatomi and colleagues regarding the effects of FGF-2 and EGF in global ischemia provides important evidence for a direct link between de novo neurogenesis and behavioral improve- ment (Nakatomi et al. , 2002). However, the contribution of other factors, such as trophic support of injured neu- rons, axonal sprouting, and synaptic modulation by the growth factors, remains to be determined. Finally, we need to improve and develop alternative methods for the detection of newborn cells. The current standard method is labeling of proliferating cells and their progeny by the thymidine analogue BrdU. However, the concerns regarding BrdU incorporation in DNA repair and into dying cells and its potential accumulation into other cellular compartments have not been com- pletely removed (Gilmore et al. , 2000; Nowakowski and Hayes, 2000; Cooper-Kuhn and Kuhn, 2002); alternative labeling methods could therefore greatly increase our confidence in the existence and significance of neuronal replacement in CNS repair.

Cells that proliferate in response to growth factors and have the ability to give rise to neurons and/or glia in vitro have been isolated from surgical specimens and postmortem tissue of donors of a broad age range. Initially, such progenitor cells were isolated from the subependymal zone of the lateral ventricle and the hippocampus, that is, the CNS regions that had previously been shown to be neurogenic in other mammalian species (Pincus et al. , 1998; Kukekov et al. , 1999; Palmer et al. , 2001). More recently, Nunes and colleagues succeeded in isolating progenitor cells from human subcortical white matter, based on the activity of a promoter or the expression of a surface marker that had previously been associated with glial precursors (Nunes et al. , 2003). Interestingly, cells puri- fied by these methods not only differentiate into glial cells but also into functionally mature neurons in vitro , suggesting that these cells might be multipotent rather than glia-restricted progenitor cells. These progenitor cells were also transplanted into the developing rat CNS. One month after transplantation, neurons and glia derived from human progenitor cells were found in the mature rat brain, indicating that the neurogenic potential of these cells was also present in vivo . Importantly, the ability to differentiate into neurons in vitro and in vivo was not dependent on prolonged culturing in the pres- ence of growth factors, suggesting that white matter– derived progenitor cells possess an intrinsic neurogenic potential. Taken together, these data suggest that neural stem/progenitor cells may be widely present in the adult human CNS. Are these progenitor cells quiescent or do they contribute to the integrity of the adult human brain? Spontaneous remyelination occurs in multiple sclerosis lesions. Platelet-derived growth factor– α (PDGF- α ) receptor has been widely used in rodent stud- ies to identify oligodendrocyte precursors. Interestingly one study found that PDGF- α receptor positive cells were present in acute and chronic lesions of patients with multiple sclerosis, suggesting that these cells might poten- tially be involved in myelin repair (Scolding et al. , 1998). However, the definite proof that these PDGF- α receptor expressing cells indeed correspond to human oligoden- drocyte progenitor cells and that they differentiate into myelinating mature oligodendrocytes is currently lacking. One study that examined postmortem brain tissue from cancer patients who received BrdU injections for diagnostic purposes has provided evidence that hip- pocampal neurogenesis is also occurring in humans (Eriksson et al. , 1998). The tissue samples varied in the postinfusion intervals (16–781 days) as well as in the age of the donor (57–72 years). BrdU-positive cells were found in the SGZ and the granular cell layer of the hip- pocampus of all specimens, indicating that in these regions new cells are continuously generated. The number of BrdU-positive cells declined with increasing post- infusion interval, suggesting that new cells in the hip- pocampus might have limited lifetimes. Interestingly, up to one fourth of the BrdU-positive cells co-labeled for the neuronal markers NeuN, calbindin, and neuron-specific enolase (Figure 23.5; see also the Color Plate section). Approximately the same percentage of newly generated cells co-labeled for the glial marker GFAP. These findings indicate that new neurons and astrocytes are continuously generated in the human dentate gyrus. BrdU-positive cells were also found in the SVZ of the lateral ventricle. The morphology of these BrdU-labeled nuclei resembled that of progenitor cells in the rodent SVZ, suggesting that these proliferating cells might correspond to the neurogenic pro- genitor cells in the rodent SVZ that migrate and differenti- ate into mature interneurons in the olfactory bulb. Taken together, the current data suggest that, similar to other mammalian species, humans retain the capacity to generate new neural cells throughout adulthood. Ethical concerns and lack of adequate techniques restrict the study of cell genesis in the adult human brain; thus there is currently no evidence that neurons or glia are regenerated in the diseased human CNS. However, the possibility of isolating cells with neural stem cell–like characteristics from different areas of the adult human brain fuels our hope that we will be able to stimulate endogenous cells to repair the diseased human CNS. CHALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS At present, our knowledge about adult neural stem cell biology is very limited. It may be premature to eval- uate the potential of endogenous stem cells to contribute to functional repair of the human CNS. There are several outstanding challenges that need to be overcome to bring us closer to defining the potential of endogenous stem cells for repair and to proposing experimental strategies for the recruitment of these cells in the diseased CNS: 1. Prospective identification and isolation of adult neural stem cells. The prospective isolation of stem cells con- stitutes a key step in the study of hematopoiesis (reviewed in Weissman et al. , 2001). Identification and separation of hematopoietic stem cells from other cell types based on their expression of surface markers allowed the detailed characterization of this cell pop- ulation. Thus far, our insight into the biology of adult neural stem cells has been primarily based on the analysis of cultured cells with stem cell–like character- istics and retrospective analysis in vivo . At this point, the identity and location of neural stem cells in vivo remains elusive and there exists no firm link between in vivo neural stem cells and cultured stem-like cells, 398 Endogenous Stem Cells and CNS Repair Ch23.qxd 9/2/04 10:23 AM Page 398"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"which raises concerns about the in vivo relevance of the in vitro findings. The development of techniques to prospectively identify and isolate adult neural stem cells will provide a powerful tool to reevaluate our hypotheses and to characterize adult neural stem cells in detail. 2. Differentiation potential of adult neural stem cells. Cells with neural stem–like characteristics have been isolated from several regions of the adult CNS. Do adult neu- ral stem cells have different characteristics depending on their region of origin? Do adult neural stem cells have broad potential and differentiate into different neuronal subtypes or are they restricted by intrinsic determinants in the types of neurons they can gener- ate? Until now it has only been demonstrated that adult neural stem cells can form functional interneu- rons in the olfactory bulb and local projection neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (van Praag et al. , 2002; Carleton et al. , 2003). However, one important requirement for therapeutic strategies using endoge- nous stem cells is the ability to specifically generate the class of nerve cell that is affected by the disease. 3. Define the regulatory mechanisms underlying cell gene- sis. Our current knowledge on the regulatory mecha- nisms of cell genesis in the adult CNS is very incomplete and primarily descriptive. With the help of new techniques such as large-scale expression analysis it should be possible to identify molecular players that govern the proliferation, fate choice, migration, inte- gration and survival of new cells. The identification of regulators may provide potential targets for the recruitment of endogenous stem cells for repair. 4. Characterization of the disease environment .How does disease alter the environment surrounding Endogenous Stem Cells and CNS Repair 399 FIGURE 23.5 Neurogenesis in the adult human hippocampal dentate gyrus. Human hippocampal tissue was obtained at autopsy from cancer patients that had received BrdU for assessment of proliferative activity of tumor cells. Staining for BrdU ( green ), the neuronal marker calbindin ( red ) and the glial marker GFAP ( blue ) demon- strated that new neurons (arrows) and astrocytes (arrowheads) are generated in the human dentate gyrus.

It is important to rec- ognize that not only defined subpopulations of neu- rons but also glial cells are killed by, for example, injury and stroke. Until recently, neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, have been thought of as diseases affecting specialized classes of neurons. However, it is becoming evident that neu- rodegeneration also elicits a glial reaction that poten- tially perpetuates neuronal cell death and it is possible that the neurodegenerative process also affects glial cells. The behavior of neural stem cells is not only con- trolled by cell-autonomous signals but is greatly influ- enced by environment-derived factors. In addition, it is evident that the function of mature nerve cells is highly dependent on an intact environment that is cre- ated by many different cell types. It is therefore impor- tant to focus not only on the replacement of dying neurons but also on the creation of a cellular environ- ment that supports the development and function of the new neurons. Finally, advances in related fields that deepen our understanding of the pathophysiology of neurological diseases and enhance our ability to safely manipulate the diseased CNS, will have a significant impact on endoge- nous stem cell–based therapies by allowing us to identify candidate diseases and by guiding us toward strategies for this experimental therapy.

As depicted in Table 24.1, the causes can be separated according to whether they are inherited or acquired, part of a syndrome, and “axonal” or “demyelinating” (whether the primary abnormality appears to affect axons/neurons or myelinat- ing Schwann cells). Non-syndromic inherited neuropathies (Table 24.2) are called Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) or hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN). Different kinds are recognized clinically, aided by electrophysiological testing of peripheral nerves (Lupski and Garcia, 2001; Kleopas and Scherer, 2002). If the fore- arm motor nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) are greater or less than 38 m/sec, the neuropathy is traditionally con- sidered to be “axonal” (CMT2/HMSN II) or “demyelinat- ing” (CMT1/HMSN I), respectively. CMT1 is more common, has an earlier age of disease-onset (first or sec- ond decade of life), and nerve biopsies show segmental demyelination and remyelination as well as axonal loss. CMT2 typically has a later onset and is associated with loss of myelinated axons, without much evidence of demyelina- tion. Besides CMT, there are other inherited neuropathies that have been traditionally given different names. These may be milder (hereditary neuropathy with liability to pres- sure palsies; HNPP), or more severe (Dejerine-Sottas syn- drome [DSS] and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy [CHN]). If the neuropathy is clinically recognized at birth, it is often called CHN; if it is recognized later in infancy, it is called DSS. Patients with CHN or DSS typically have NCVs less than 10 m/sec, and dysmyelinated axons characterized by improperly formed myelin sheaths. Beginning in the early 1990s, the molecular causes of many inherited neuropathies were discovered, as summa- rized in Table 24.2. The molecular diagnoses are often dif- ficult to reconcile with the traditional classification schemes, and the relationships between the genotypes of phenotypes of CMT are complex and incompletely understood. As these issues have been thoroughly reviewed (Lupski and Garcia, 2001; Kleopas and Scherer, 2002), a few salient points will be emphasized here: ● CMT1, CMT2, and DSS/CHN are caused by muta- tions in different genes; for DSS/CHN, both dominant and recessive causes are known. Conversely, different mutations in the same gene cause different pheno- types. ● Some dominant mutations cause haplotype insuffi- ciency. In this case, the phenotype results from the loss of the gene product of one allele. For example, the deletion of peripheral myelin protein 22kDa ( PMP22 ) causes HNPP, a loss-of-function KIF1B mutation causes CMT2A, and loss-of-function myelin protein zero ( MPZ ) mutations cause CMT1B. ● Most dominant mutations have a “toxic-gain-of- function”—this term includes dominant-negative effects on the wild-type allele, as well as other effects such as the consequences of a misfolded mutant pro- tein. Dominant mutations that cause a gain-of- function are not necessarily informative about the normal function of the wild-type protein. ● For most CMT genes, there is compelling evidence that the more severe phenotypes are caused by gain- of-function alleles, and that (heterozygous) loss-of- function alleles are associated with milder phenotypes. 405 CHAPTER 24 Neuropathies—Translating Causes into Treatments Christiane Massicotte, DMV, PhD Steven S. Scherer, MD, PhD Ch24.qxd 9/1/04 6:51 AM Page 405"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"Mutations of PMP22 , MPZ , and neurofilament light ( NEFL ) are examples. ● Demyelinating neuropathies are caused by mutations in genes expressed by myelinating Schwann cells, and are first manifested in the myelinating Schwann cells themselves. Conversely, axonal neuropathies are caused by mutations in genes expressed by neurons, and are first manifested in axons. There are possible exceptions to this scheme, such as NEFL mutations that appear to cause a demyelinating neuropathy, and MPZ mutations that appear to cause an axonal neuropathy. ● Animal models provide the proper cellular context for examining the effects of mutations, including the key means of analyzing the development of neuropathy (Martini, 1997). Neurons and Axonal Neuropathies Peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons have axons outside of the central nervous system (CNS). These include motor, sensory, autonomic, and enteric neurons, as well as the special senses except for vision. Even though these neurons serve diverse functions, their shared molecular characteristics join them in certain genetic diseases. For example, the relevant sensory and autonomic neurons are absent in individuals with congenital insensitivity to pain and anhidrosis (CIPA) because the gene encoding the TrkA receptor is mutated. TrkA binds nerve growth factor (NGF), a trophic factor required for the survival of these neurons during their early development (Bibel and Barde, 1999). Similarly, a shared vulnerability for the same molecular defect may explain why hearing loss, retinitis pigmen- tosa, and/or other CNS manifestations are associated with certain syndromic neuropathies (for examples, see website: http://www.neuro.wustl.edu/neuromuscular/). In most neuropathies, the clinical features tend to have a distal predilection, both in first appearance and in ulti- mate severity. This suggests that axonal length itself is the primary determinant of neuropathy. Axons have a prominent cytoskeleton composed of neurofilaments and microtubules. Neurofilaments are composed of three subunits, termed heavy, medium, and light. Dominant mutations in NEFL , the gene encoding the light subunit, cause an axonal neuropathy, CMT2E (see Table 24.2). Because heterozygous Nefl -null mice do not develop a CMT2-like neuropathy (Zhu et al., 1997), dominant NEFL mutations are probably not the result of haplo- type insufficiency caused by loss-of-function alleles. Introduction of an L394P mutation disrupts neurofila- ment assembly and causes a severe, dominantly inherited neuropathy/ neuronopathy in transgenic mice (Lee et al., 1994). Similarly, a dominant Nefl mutation in quail causes neuropathy with profoundly reduced axonal cal- ibers (Ohara et al., 1993). Thus, missense mutations may disorganize neurofilament assembly, causing neuropathy and even altered axonal caliber. In agreement, gene transfer experiments in cultured neurons suggest that CMT2E-associated m utations disrupt the assembly and axonal transport of neurofilaments (Brownlees et al., 2002; Perez-Olle et al., 2002). A distal predilection, however, does not mean that the defect necessarily lies in the axons themselves; it could just as well represent a primary neuron cell body abnor- mality. Neurons with the longest axons could be the most vulnerable to a given insult. For instance, large doses of pyridoxine promptly kill large primary sensory neurons, whereas smaller doses cause only subtle shrinkage of these neurons, and mild distal axonal degeneration (Xu et al., 1989). Thus, a modest neuronal abnormality may result in distal axonopathy, but a more severe insult of the same type may cause the neuron itself to degenerate as the primary event. The neuropathological appearance of some inherited axonal neuropathies consists of pri- mary nerve cell body degeneration associated with anterograde degeneration of the axons. Some inherited axonal neuropathies, such as the hereditary motor neu- ropathies and hereditary sensory (and autonomic) neuropathies (see Table 24.2), could be considered as pri- mary neuronopathies rather than primary axonopathies, but it is difficult to make this distinction. PNS axons are the longest cells in the body, and contain much more cytoplasm than their cell bodies themselves.

Molecular motors, kinesins, mediate orthograde axonal transport, using microtubules as tracks. Kinesins are a large gene family, and each kinesin transports specific organelles. A dominant mutation in the gene encoding kinesin KIF1B β causes an inherited axonal neuropathy, probably by haplotype insufficiency. Mutations affecting another kinesin, KIF5A, cause a dominantly inherited form of hereditary spastic paraparesis, possibly by dis- rupting microtubule-dependent slow axonal transport, including the transport of neurofilaments (Xia et al., 2003). Retrograde axonal transport is mediated by the dynein-dynactin complex. If this complex is disrupted in transgenic mice, a progressive motor neuron disease is observed that is caused by deficient retrograde transport and neurofilament accumulation (LaMonte et al., 2002). In accord with these findings, a dominant mutation in the p150 subunit of dynactin has been found in a family with a dominantly inherited motor neuron disease. Finally, recessive mutations in gigaxonin cause giant axonal neu- ropathy, a syndromic condition in which CNS and PNS neurons are affected, possibly both in a length-dependent pattern. Gigaxonin binds to microtubule-associated pro- tein 1B (MAP1B), and enhances microtubule stability (Ding et al., 2002). One anticipates that disrupted axonal transport may be a consequence of other genetic muta- tions that cause neuropathy and/or neuronopathy. Deficient axonal transport has long been considered to be a most attractive hypothesis to account for length-related axonal degeneration (Griffin and Watson, 1988). Myelinating Schwann Cells and Demyelinating Neuropathies Myelin is a multilamellar spiral of specialized cell membrane that ensheathes axons larger than 1 μ m in diam- eter (Scherer and Arroyo, 2002). By reducing the capaci- tance and/or increasing the resistance, myelin reduces cur- rent flow across the internodal axonal membrane, thereby facilitating saltatory conduction at nodes. The myelin sheath itself can be divided into two domains—compact and noncompact myelin—each containing a nonoverlap- ping set of proteins (Figure 24.1; see also Color Plate sec- tion). Compact myelin forms the bulk of the myelin sheath. It is largely composed of lipids (including choles- terol, sphingolipids, galactocerebroside, and sulfatide) as well as the proteins—P0, PMP22, and myelin basic pro- tein (MBP). Noncompact myelin is found in paranodes and incisures and contains a mutually exclusive set of molecules, including the gap junction protein connexin 32 (Cx32), myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and E-cadherin. The outermost/abaxonal cell membrane, apposing the basal lamina, contains dystroglycan and α 6 β 4 integrin, which are receptors of laminin-2. Dystroglycan is linked to a complex that contains periaxin, which may, in turn, be linked to compact myelin. PMP22 Mutations Cause HNPP, CMT1A, DSS, and CHN PMP22 is a small intrinsic membrane protein (see Figure 24.1). PMP22 is involved in early steps of myelination and plays a structural role in compact myelin. How deletion and duplication of PMP22 cause HNPP and CMT1A, respec- tively, is not completely settled, but the deleterious effects are related to gene dosage, which in turn, is correlated with the relative amounts of PMP22 protein found in compact myelin (Lupski and Garcia, 2001; Suter and Scherer, 2003). PMP22 can form dimers and even multimers and may also interact with P0 (Tobler et al., 2002), so that an altered PMP22/P0 ratio might destabilize the myelin sheath. 408 Peripheral Neuropathies and Treatments Hereditary Sensory (and Autonomic) Neuropathies/Neuronopathies (HSN or HSAN) HSN-1 (162400) Dominant SPTLC1 mutations Onset second to third decade; severe sensory loss with distal ulcerations; also length-dependent weakness.

Except for the patients with the HNPP phenotype, most patients with PMP22 point mutations, including those with a CMT1 phenotype, are more severely affected than those carrying the duplica- tion or deletion (Lupski and Garcia, 2001; Kleopas and Scherer, 2002). The inference that these mutations cause a gain-of-abnormal function is strongly supported by the finding that the neuropathy in heterozygous Trembler ( Tr ; G150D) and Trembler-J ( Tr-J ; L16P) mice is more severe than that in Pmp22 heterozygous null ( Pmp22 + / - ) mice (Adlkofer et al., 1997). If the mutant PMP22 could block a proportion of wild-type PMP22 from transport to the cell membrane by a dominant-negative effect, this should result in a phenotype between a heterozygous and a homozygous Pmp22 -null ( Pmp22 - / - ) mouse. The severe phenotype of Tr and Tr-J mice, however, suggests that the mutant protein has another toxic gain-of-function (Adlkofer et al., 1997). PMP22 dominant mutant proteins could have several effects. In cultured cells, they are retained intracellularly in the ER and/or the intermediate compartment, and may aggregate abnormally (Tobler et al., 2002). Epitope- tagged versions of Tr and Tr-J in developing rat nerves via adenoviral gene transfer confirms the inability of these mutant proteins to reach the myelin sheath (Colby et al., 2000). Accumulation of mutant PMP22 could trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the ER as described for proteolipid protein mutants (Southwood et al., 2002). However, markers of the UPR are not grossly altered in Tr-J nerves (Dickson et al., 2002). Instead, wild-type PMP22 and L16P (Tr-J) mutant proteins form a complex with the chaperon calnexin in the ER. L16P has an increased association time with calnexin, suggesting that the sequestration of calnexin might contribute to the dis- ease mechanism by affecting the general protein folding quality control pathway (Dickson et al., 2002).

The crystal structure of P0 reveals that it forms tetramers that bind other tetramers both in cis (in the plane of the mem- brane) and in trans (on the apposed membrane), thereby holding the extracellular surfaces of the myelin sheath together. The positively charged cytoplasmic tail of P0 likely interacts with the negatively charged phospholipids of the membrane, thereby augmenting the role of MBP in holding the apposed cytoplasmic surfaces of the mem- branes together. These functions have been confirmed in transfection experiments, and in mice lacking P0 ( Mpz − / − mice), which have uncompacted myelin and severe demyelination. Like PMP22, the “dose” of P0 in myelin appears to be critical: reduced P0 causes myelin instabil- ity (Martini et al., 1995), and overexpression of P0 causes severe dysmyelination that correlates with the level of expression (Wrabetz et al., 2000; Yin et al., 2000). More than 80 different MPZ mutations have been identified, including missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations. Most cause a CMT phenotype that is typi- cally more severe than CMT1A; others cause a severe dysmyelinating/demyelinating neuropathy (DSS/CHN) or even a late onset, CMT2-like. Milder phenotypes (CMT1B) may be caused by haplotype insufficiency; severe phenotypes are caused by a toxic-gain-of-function. How do different MPZ mutations result in such different phenotypes? Diminished adhesion is one possibility; this has been observed for mutations affecting functional P0 domains, including a PKC phosphorylation site (Xu et al., 2001). More severe phenotypes could be caused by dominant-negative effects of the mutant protein. Whether mutants have other toxic effects, such as induc- ing an UPR, remains to be determined. GJB1 Mutations Cause CMT1X Cx32 belongs to a family of about 20 highly homolo- gous proteins, the connexins. Six connexins form a hemi- channel, and two apposed hemi-channels form a functional channel. Gap junctions mediate the diffusion of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells, but in the myelin sheath, they allow diffusion between the lay- ers of the same cell (Balice-Gordon et al., 1998), as depicted in Figure 24.1. Such a radial pathway—directly across the layers of the myelin sheath—would be advan- tageous as it provides a much shorter pathway (up to 1000-fold) than a circumferential route. Disruption of this radial pathway may be the reason that GJB1 / Gjb1 mutations cause demyelination in humans and in mice. However, this pathway did not appear to be different between Gjb1 -null and wild-type mice, implying that another connexin also forms functional gap junctions in PNS myelin sheaths. This connexin may be Cx29/Cx31.3 (Altevogt et al., 2002). CMT1X is caused by mutations in GJB1 , the gene that encodes Cx32. More than 240 mutations have been identified, affecting the promoter, 3 ′ untranslated region, and every domain of the protein. In transfected mam- malian cells, most mutants accumulate in the ER or Golgi apparatus and hence are nonfunctional (Yum et al., 2002). The subset of mutants that reach the cell membrane may form functional channels, often with abnormal characteristics (Abrams et al., 2000). How the mutants that form functional channels in cultured cells cause diseases in vivo remains to be determined. Other manifestations of CMT1X have been reported, including relapsing stroke-like episodes that resolve. These “CNS mutants” probably have an addition toxic effect, possibly by interacting with Cx47, which is also expressed by oligodendrocytes, as mice lacking both Cx32 and Cx47 have a severe CNS demyelination (Menichella et al., 2003; Odermatt et al., 2003). Other Inherited Demyelinating Neuropathies The aforementioned kinds of CMT are the most com- mon and are caused by known mutations in “structural proteins” of the myelin sheath. The molecular defects of one third of CMT1 families remain to be discovered (Boerkoel et al., 2002). Even these less common causes should be sought vigorously, as they will potentially pro- vide key insights into the function of myelinated axons (see Figure 24.1). Mutations in LITAF are associated with dominantly inherited CMT1C. LITAF (lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-alpha factor) encodes a widely expressed tran- script. LITAF mutations appear to cluster (G112S, T115N, W116G), potentially defining a putative domain of the LITAF protein. The function of LITAF, its role in myelinating Schwann cells, and the mechanism of domi- nant mutations all remain to be determined. Mutations in two transcription factors, ERG2 and SOX10 , cause demyelinating neuropathy. Both are expressed in myelinating Schwann cells. Dominant EGR2 mutants likely affect the expression of myelin- related genes (Nagarajan et al., 2001), possibly by directly affecting activation of the MPZ and GJB1 pro- moters (Kleopas and Scherer, 2002). Mutations affecting the zinc finger domain of ERG2 impair DNA binding, resulting in residual binding that correlates with disease severity (Warner et al., 1999). A recessive R1 domain mutation prevents interaction of EGR2 with the NAB corepressors and thereby increases transcriptional activ- ity.

Rare, autosomal recessive forms of demyelinating CMT have been collectively designated CMT4 (see Table 24.2). Recessive mutations in ganglioside-induced differentiation- associated protein-1 ( GDAP1 ) cause CMT4A, initially characterized by a severe demyelinating neuropathy. However, recessive GDAP1 mutations have also been described in severe axonal neuropathy (AR-CMT2). Except for the relative preservation of NCV, some affected individuals could be called DSS. This variability raises the possibility that GDAP1 mutations affect both neurons and Schwann cells. Moreover, it remains to be determined whether these effects are cell type–autonomous or caused by altered axon-Schwann cell interactions. The GDAP1 protein is predicted to have two transmembrane domains and a glutathione S transferase domain, suggesting a role in antioxidant pathways or detoxification. If such a func- tion can be experimentally confirmed, damage due to reac- tive oxygen species would be an attractive hypothesis for the underlying disease mechanism. Recessive mutations in myotubularin-related protein-2 ( MTMR2 ) cause CMT4B1. Nerve biopsy specimens have a distinctive feature, irregular folding and redundant loops of myelin, suggesting the primary defect occurs in myelinating Schwann cells. Neuronal expression may also contribute to the phenotype. MTMR2 is one of about a dozen members of the highly conserved family of myotubularin-related dual specific phosphatases, whose principal physiological substrates are the phospholipids phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P) and phos- phatidylinositol-3,5-phosphate (PI(3,5)P2). These phos- pholipids are dephosphorylated by MTM1, MTMR2, MTMR3, and MTMR6 at the D3 position (Berger et al., 2002). MTMR2 mutations affect different parts of the protein, although reduced or absent phosphatase activity appears to be a common denominator (Berger et al., 2002). Because phosphoinositides regulate intracellular membrane trafficking, CMT4B1 might be the result of abnormal membrane recycling, and/or endocytic or exo- cytotic processes, and/or disturbed membrane-mediated transport pathways. In addition, the neurofilament light subunit may be a substrate for MTMR2. Mutations in MTMR13/SBF2 , which is related to MTMR2 , cause CMT4B2, which has similar pathologi- cal features to CMT4B1. Some mutations cause neu- ropathy alone, whereas other mutations also cause glaucoma. MTMR13 encodes a protein lacking a func- tional phosphatase domain, but it may interact directly with MTMR2, just as MTM1 and MTMR2 can interact with the pseudophosphatases MTMR12 and MTMR5, respectively (Kim et al., 2003). By this analo gy, MTMR13 may regulate the phosphatase activity and/or alter the subcellular localization of MTMR2. MTMR13 mRNA is broadly expressed, including in the brain, spinal cord and sciatic nerve (see Figure 24.1). Given their possible interactions, it will be imperative to determine the cellu- lar/subcellular localizations and activities of MTMR2, MTMR5, and MTMR13, and correlate these findings with the various potential disease mechanisms outlined previously. Recessive mutations in N-myc downstream-regulated gene-1 ( NDRG1 ) cause CMT4D. CMT4D is a syndromic neuropathy, as affected individuals also have hearing loss and dysmorphic features. It was initially described in Gypsies from Lom, Bulgaria, but has been subsequently found in Gypsies in other countries. The disease has a clinical onset in childhood and progresses to severe dis- ability by the fifth decade. Biopsy specimens show demyelination, onion bulbs, and cytoplasmic inclusions in Schwann cells. Many cell types, including Schwann cells, express NDGR1 as an intracellular protein (see Figure 24.1 and the Color Plate section), but its function is unknown. Recessive mutations in the periaxin ( PRX ) cause CMT4F. These mutations are expected to cause loss-of- function. Affected members usually have a “DSS pheno- type” with delayed motor milestones, progressing to severe distal weakness. Milder, “CMT-like,” cases are less common. Sensory loss, to the point of sensory ataxia, is more prominent than in other inherited demyelinating neuropathies. These findings are consistent with the phe- notype of prx -null mice, in which myelin sheaths are ini- tially formed, then fold abnormally, then break down (Gillespie et al., 2000). Periaxin is a membrane-associ- ated protein with a PDZ domain, exclusively expressed in myelinating Schwann cells (see Figure 24.1). Abaxonal periaxin interacts with the dystroglycan complex through dystrophin-related protein-2 (DRP-2), thereby linking laminin-2 in the basal lamina to the actin cytoskeleton and possibly other components in the cytoplasm (Sherman et al., 2001). It is surprising that disrupting this complex results in a severe demyelinating neuropathy, as Schwann cells express also two other dystrophin com- plexes—one containing utrophin and another an isoform of dystrophin. The indispensable nature of the dystrogly- can-DRP-2-periaxin complex may be related to the peripheral neuropathy of leprosy, as the binding of Mycobacterium leprae to α -dystroglycan can cause demyelination (Rambukkana et al., 2002). THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS—GENERAL In the case of toxic neuropathies, prevention is the goal. Agents without a clinical use, such as acrylamide, arsenic, or thallium, should be avoided. Useful medica tions Peripheral Neuropathies and Treatments 411 Ch24.qxd 9/1/04 6:51 AM Page 411"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"that rarely cause neuropathy, such as statins, may be dis- continued if neuropathy develops. For clinically impor- tant drugs that cause neuropathy in a dose-related manner, such as colchicine, thalidomide, vincristine, paclitaxel/taxol, or cisplatin, vigilant observation is required to minimize the amount of damage. For this last group of drugs, it is highly desirable to develop coun- termeasures, so that neuropathy—often their dose- limiting toxic effect—could be ameliorated or avoided. Concomitant treatment with trophic factors (see below) is such an approach. Prevention is also a feasible strategy for neuropathies that are the result of certain diseases. In these cases, treat- ing the underlying disease should limit the amount of neuropathy. Antibiotics for leprosy, dialysis for uremia, and rigorous control of serum glucose levels are all examples. Similarly, correcting certain vitamin deficien- cies (B 1 /thiamine, B 6 /pyridoxine, and B 12 /cobalamine) should prevent the worsening of the corresponding defi- ciency-related neuropathy. Autoimmune neuropathies are another important, treatable group of neuropathies. These include acute (e.g., Guillain-Barré syndrome) and chronic (chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneu- ropathy) diseases in which myelinated axons appear to be the target of an immune response, as well as various kinds of vasculitis, in which peripheral nerves suffer ischemic damage. Effective immune-modulating drugs exist for these diseases (see Chapter 10 by Asbury in this volume). Moreover, to the degree that the immune sys- tem mediates the severity of inherited neuropathies (Maurer et al., 2002), immune-modulating drugs might also be considered for these diseases. Therapeutic Considerations—Inherited Neuropathies Understanding the molecular pathogenesis of inher- ited neuropathies is essential for the development of rational therapies. While much remains to be learned, it is clear that most are caused by the expression of a mutant allele(s) in myelinating Schwann cells or neu- rons. For recessive neuropathies, one could, in principle, “replace” the defective gene by introducing a normal version. This has been done for Cx32—a transgenic mouse expressing the normal human GJB1/Cx32 gene prevents the development of demyelinating in Gjb1/cx32 -null mice (Scherer, unpublished observa- tions). For dominant neuropathies, the situation is more complex, as these are likely to be caused by a toxic gain- of-function that is not necessarily related to the normal function of the gene product. Nevertheless, for domi- nant demyelinating neuropathies caused by altered gene dosage, reestablishing the normal level of gene expres- sion might be of benefit—a transgenic mouse provides a proof-of-concept that demyelination can be reversed by normalizing expression of PMP22. In the case of CMT1A, where overexpression of PMP22 in Schwann cells leads to segmental demyelination and ultimately axonal loss, the role of gene therapy will be to reduce the expression of this gene. This could be achieved by deliv- ery of a recombinant adenovirus expressing PMP22 antisense messenger RNA or oligonucleotide antisense therapy. Transfection of PMP22 has already been demonstrated in myelinating Schwann cells using a repli- cation-defective adenovirus in sciatic nerves of rats (Colby et al., 2000). For PMP22 mutant proteins that form an abnormal complex with calnexin resulting in its sequestration in the endoplasmic reticulum, increasing calnexin levels might be therapeutic. Knowing the molecular basis of inherited diseases prompts immediate consideration of gene therapy. Because germ line transmission is not an option for treat- ing human diseases, viral vectors have been widely used. Schwann cells and neurons can be infected, and numer- ous vectors and ways of delivering them have been devel- oped (see Chapter 15 by Tuszynski in this volume). However, there are no proven ways of targeting vectors to Schwann cells or PNS neurons selectively, and their wide distribution and isolation by blood-brain, blood- nerve, and perineurial barriers are additional logistical problems. Retroviral vectors (Feltri et al., 1992), aden- oviral vectors (Shy et al., 1995; Sorensen et al., 1998; Guénard et al., 1999; Colby et al., 2000) and adeno-asso- ciated viral (AAV) vectors (Ralph et al., 2000) can infect Schwann cells, and one presumes that other vectors can, too. After injecting replication-deficient adenovirus into peripheral nerves, PMP22 and P0 cDNAs can be expressed from viral promoters, and the corresponding proteins can be detected (Guénard et al., 1999; Colby et al., 2000). To date, however, not a single genetically affected Schwann cell or neuron has been cured in this manner. Progress in this area demands more sophisti- cated delivery systems and more knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of neuropathies. Theoretically, one could use a promiscuous vector and restrict gene expression to myelinating Schwann cells or PNS neurons. The neuron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE) pro- vides an illuminating example. Originally identified within the promoter of the type II sodium channel gene, NRSE is a negative-acting regulatory element that pre- vents the expression of genes in non-neuronal cell types. The addition of an NRSE restricts the expression of a reporter gene (luciferase) to neuronal cells following intramuscular or intracerebral injections of adenoviral vectors (Millecamps et al., 2000). Inducible promoter systems are available, such as a tetracycline-inducible transgene, and these can be incorporated into viral vec- tors. When combined with cell type–specific promoters, 412 Peripheral Neuropathies and Treatments Ch24.qxd 9/1/04 6:51 AM Page 412"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"such as the synapsin-1 or GFAP promoter, gene expres- sion can be specifically targeted to neuronal or glial pop- ulations (Ralph et al., 2000; Chtarto et al., 2003). Regulating the level of gene expression by inducible pro- moters in specific cell types is an attractive idea for dis- ease caused by altered gene dosage. It is possible that targeting other cell types could be beneficial in the treatment of certain neuropathies. For example, percutaneous intramuscular gene transfer of vas- cular endothelial gene factor protects neurons from ischemic peripheral neuropathy by promoting angiogene- sis (Schratzberger et al., 2001). Cotransfecting hepatocyte growth factor and prostacyclin synthase is more effective than either one alone in stimulating angiogenesis and improving experimental diabetic neuropathy (Koike et al., 2003). Using vectors as a means of increasing the systemic levels of trophic factors appears to work. The subcuta- neous administration of a herpes simplex virus–mediated expression of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) ameliorates the devel- opment of pyridoxine/B 6 -toxic neuropathy (Chatto- padhyay et al., 2002). Electroporation-mediated gene transfer following intramuscular injection of plasmid con- taining murine NT-3 cDNA reduces cisplatin-induced neuropathy (Pradat et al., 2001). Preventing Axonal Loss How do molecular defects that originate in Schwann cells and result in demyelination affect axons? Regardless of the cause of demyelination, the myelin sheath has pro- nounced effects on axonal caliber, axonal transport, the phosphorylation and packing of neurofilaments, and the organization of ion channels in the axonal membrane (Scherer and Arroyo, 2002). The degree of demyelination can be correlated with axonal loss (Martini, 2001), but pronounced axonal pathology has been observed even in genetic models in which axons are associated with nor- mal appearing myelin sheaths. How do myelinating glia communicate with axons (and vice versa), and how does demyelination alter axon-Schwann cell interactions? Possibilities include increased energetic costs of propa- gating action potentials, decreased trophic support from Schwann cells, abnormal signaling emanating from the altered myelin sheath itself, and the loss of signals from the adaxonal glial membrane and/or cytoplasm, espe- cially in the paranodal region. Other contributing factors to demyelination and/or axonal loss include inflamma- tory changes initiated by demyelination (Maurer et al., 2002). Determining the cause of axonal loss in inherited demyelinating neuropathies is of great importance because it is a prominent feature of many diseases, and likely causes clinical disabilities. These diseases include neuropathies and some neuronopathies, as well as more pervasive neurodegenerative disorders (neuroaxonal dys- trophy, giant axonal neuropathy, and hereditary spastic paraparesis) and inflammatory demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis. Existing animal models should be key in this regard (Sancho et al., 1999). One anticipates that such studies will elucidate whether the mechanisms are the same in different demyelinating as well as axonal neuropathies and reveal why axonal loss is length-dependent. The most attractive hypothesis to account for why axonal degeneration is maximal at the distal ends is altered axonal transport (Griffin and Watson, 1988). Wallerian degeneration may be related to length- dependent axonal loss. Wallerian degeneration refers to changes that occur distal to an interrupted axon, includ- ing the degeneration of axons, the proliferation and de- differentiation of Schwann cells, the invasion of the nerve by macrophages, and degradation of myelin (Scherer and Salzer, 2001). Although usually studied fol- lowing mechanical injury in rodents, the identical fea- tures are found in the nerves of patients with nontraumatic neuropathies. The available evidence sup- ports the idea that the same pathophysiological mecha- nisms occur in all neuropathies (Wang et al., 2000; Coleman and Perry, 2002). For example, elevated intra- cellular Ca 2 + is required for the degeneration of PNS and CNS axons in a variety of experimental models, includ- ing axotomy, blunt trauma, and hypoxia/ischemia. Increased Ca 2 + activates calpains, proteases that degrade the axonal cytoskeleton, whereas lowering intracellular Ca 2 + or inhibiting calpains reduces axonal degeneration in these models (Glass et al., 2002). Similarly, Wld S mice have slowed Wallerian degeneration and are relatively resistant to toxic neuropathy and even the axonal loss Mpz -null mice (Wang et al., 2002; Samsam et al., 2003). A chromosomal alteration in Wld S mice generates a novel chimeric protein, and expression of this protein alone accounts for the phenotype (Mack et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2001). Trophic Factors Trophic factors are a most promising approach to treat established neuropathies or prevent toxin-related neuropathies. The trophic dependence of developing neurons and glia is well established (Bibel and Barde, 1999; Jessen and Mirsky, 1999), and the same trophic factors typically affect the corresponding cells in adult animals. The main conceptual problem with this approach is the diversity of both trophic factors and PNS neurons, especially because different kinds of neurons respond to different trophic factors (Table 24.3). Three families of trophic factors are particularly important for PNS neurons—the neurotrophin family, the glial-derived Peripheral Neuropathies and Treatments 413 Ch24.qxd 9/1/04 6:51 AM Page 413"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family, and the ciliary neu- rotrophic factor (CNTF) family of cytokines (see Figure 24.2). Neuregulin-1 is singularly important for Schwann cells. NGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and NT-4 constitute the neu- rotrophin family (Bibel and Barde, 1999). They are secreted as homodimers and cleaved by a protease to their mature form. All bind to the p75 receptor, but the uncleaved form of NGF binds with highest affinity. Each of the neurotrophins binds to protein tyrosine kinase (Trk) receptors, causing dimerization, autophospho- rylation, and downstream signaling (see Figure 24.2). All Trks interact with p75, and p75 can also signal independently of the Trks. GDNF, neurturin, artemin, and persephin constitute the GDNF family, which belongs to the transforming growth factor beta superfamily. Unlike the other mem- bers of this superfamily, members of the GDNF family bind at least one glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)- linked protein known as GFR α 1-4 (see Figure 24.2), all of which bind to a common signal transducing subunit, the protein tyrosine kinase receptor, c-ret (Rosenthal, 1999). Binding causes dimerization, autophosphorylation, and downstream signaling. CNTF, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-11, cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), cardiotrophin- like cytokine (CLC), and oncostatin-M are a family of structurally related cytokines that share a common set of receptors (Bravo and Heath, 2000; Plun-Favreau et al., 2001). An intrinsic membrane protein, gp130, is the sig- nal transducing subunit common to all of these cytokines. The LIF receptor is composed of gp130 and the LIF β receptor (LIF β R) subunit, also an integral membrane protein. IL-6R α is a soluble receptor for IL-6. CNTFR α has a GPI anchor, but may also exist in a soluble form; it is a receptor for CNTF and CLC. The IL-6/IL-6R complex interacts with gp130, and the CNTF/CNTFR α and CLC/CLF/CNTFR α complexes interact with LIF β R and gp130. Cells that express gp130 and LIF β R respond similarly to CNTF and LIF, and signal through the JAK-STAT pathway, in which the cytoplasmic STAT proteins translocate into the nucleus where they act as transcription factors. Neuregulin-1 is the founding member of the neureg- ulin family, which belongs to epidermal growth factor (EGF) superfamily (Lemke, 1996). Alternative promot- ers and alternative splicing generates soluble and mem- brane-bound proteins of different potency. Like all members of the EGF superfamily, neuregulin-1 binds to members of the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase family— ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. Ligand binding results in receptor dimerization, tyrosine phosphoryla- tion, and subsequent activation of intracellular signaling pathways, notably the PI3-K and ras /MAP kinase pathways. ErbB2 and ErbB3 are the neuregulin receptors of Schwann cells, and both are required for signal transduction (see Figure 24.2). In addition to their effects on developing neurons, trophic factors have effects on mature PNS neurons (see Table 24.3). Neurite outgrowth in vitro and on axonal regeneration in vivo are the best documented (Terenghi, 1999), but many of these growth factors also modulate other aspects of the neuronal response to axotomy (Scherer and Salzer, 2001). Neuronal receptors probably mediate these effects—only neurons with the proper receptors typically respond to a given growth factor. Receptor-mediated, retrograde axonal transport delivers the trophic factors to neuronal cell bodies, where they likely exert their effects. NGF, BDNF, NT-3, NT-4, an engineered “pan-neurotrophin,” CNTF, IL-6, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF I and II) have all been reported to enhance axonal regeneration. Schwann cells themselves express most of these trophic factors, but overexpressing a given trophic factor in neurons, Schwann cells, or other cells using viral vectors has been reported to enhance regeneration (Gravel et al., 1997). Trophic factors can also prevent or ameliorate neu- ropathy. In animal models, NT-3 reduces neuropathy caused by B6/pyridoxin or cisplatin; this makes sense because these toxins principally affect large sensory neurons that express the NT-3 receptor, TrkC (Pradat 414 Peripheral Neuropathies and Treatments TABLE 24.3 Trophic Factor Responsiveness of PNS Neurons Neuronal type Trophic Factor Receptor motoneurons BNDF, NT-4 TrkB NT-3 trkC GDNF GFR α 1 + ret LIF LIF β R + gp130 CNTF CNTFR α+ gp130 pre-ganglionic NT-4 TrkB autonomic GDNF GFR α 1 + ret TGF-betas Type I & II sympathetic NGF trkA parasympathetic NTN GFR α 2 + ret muscle spindle NT-3 trkC afferents trkA nociceptive NGF trkA IB4 nociceptive GNDF GFR α 1 + ret mechanoreceptors NT-3 trkC enteric neurons GDNF GFR α 1 + ret neurturin GFR α 2 + ret Ch24.qxd 9/1/04 6:51 AM Page 414"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"et al., 2001). Interestingly, therapeutic effects of NT-3 for cisplatin-treated mice or human diabetic patients were not dose-dependent and the beneficial effects could be seen at the lowest doses. NGF, however, also ameliorates cisplatin-induced neuropathy—likely an indirect effect, because the “rescued” cells do not express TrkA. This discrepancy remains to be clarified. GDNF specifically prevents the loss of central termi- nals of IB4-positive sensory neurons in the spinal cord of diabetic mice; it does not affect those of TrkA- positive neurons, which are NGF-responsive (Akkina 2001). Just as these IB-4 central terminals are lost after axotomy, experimental diabetes causes a functional, if not structural, axotomy. IGF-I and NT-3 ameliorate diabetic neuropathy, and IGF-1 prevents vincristine neuropathy; these are probably direct effects on PNS neurons. These trophic factors have been administered exogenously and/or by infecting cells with an appropri- ate viral construct. In one large clinical trial, however, exogenous NGF did not alter the progression of human diabetic neuropathy. A combination of trophic factors, or engineered “pan-neurotrophic factors” (Funakoshi et al., 1998), might be more beneficial than a single factor. The rationale for treating neuropathy with trophic factors pertains to the treatment of neuronopathies. Motoneuron diseases have been particularly well stud- ied in this regard. Local injection of CNTF- and/or BDNF-expressing adenoviruses into the facial nucleus improves the survival of motoneurons for at least 5 weeks post-axotomy, even though less than 10% of the motoneurons are infected (Gravel et al., 1997). Treating pmn mice, a model of inherited motoneuron disease, by intramuscular or intravenous injection of CNTF- expressing adenovirus increased life span by 25% and reduced the degeneration of phrenic myelinated axons (Haase et al., 1999). Finally, in a genetically authentic animal model of spinal muscular atrophy, intramuscu- lar injections of CT-1–expressing adenovirus improves median survival, delays motor defects, and reduces the loss of myelinated axons (Lesbordes et al., 2003). Despite impressive results both in cultured motoneu- rons and in animal models (Sendtner et al., 2000), large human trials using BDNF, CNTF, or IGF-I for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have not provided proof of efficacy. Schwann cells have also adapted to enhance axonal regeneration and remyelination (Scherer and Salzer, Peripheral Neuropathies and Treatments 415 A C Cell Membrane Cell Membrane Extracellular Extracellular Intracellular Intracellular p75 NGF BDNF NT-3 NT-4 TrkA TrkB TrkC p75 P13-K P13-K ras ras ret PLC γ PLC γ PLC γ kinase kinase kinase kinase domain kinase Extracellular Extracellular Cell Membrane Cell Membrane nrg-1 erbB2 erbB3 Intracellular Intracellular P13-K P P ras inactive active B D GDNF NTN ART PSP GFR α 1 GFR α 2 GFR α 3 GFR α 4 LIF IL-6 IL-6R α CNTFR α CNTFR α CNTF CLC CT-1 gp130 LIFR gp130 gp130 gp130 LIFR Jak STAT FIGURE 24.2 Ligand-receptor interactions in the PNS.

Axonal regeneration in chronically denervated distal nerve stumps can be enhanced by treating Schwann cells with TGF- β (Sulaiman and Gordon, 2002). Further, neuregulin-1 enhances axonal regeneration (Chen et al., 1998), probably by acting on Schwann cells as PNS neu- rons do not express neuregulin receptors. Desert hedge- hog, a morphogen expressed by Schwann cells, helps prevent the progression of experimental diabetic neu- ropathy (Calcutt et al., 2003). SUMMARY Neuropathies are common, but their causes are diverse. There are promising prospects for developing safe and effective therapies for peripheral neuropathies, particularly with trophic factors. Although trophic fac- tors can be produced by gene therapy, this is unlikely to be clinically applicable, because purified factors can be given. The potential roles of gene therapy include replac- ing genes in diseases caused by loss-of-function muta- tions, and modifying the levels of expression in dominantly inherited neuropathies caused by altered gene dosage. Many obstacles, however, will need to be overcome to make gene therapy a feasible strategy, including an efficient means of targeting genes to myeli- nating Schwann cells and/or neurons without significant cellular toxicity. Understanding the molecular basis of neuropathies will bring new therapeutic strategies for a number of neuropathic and neurodegenerative disorders.

There is a very well-described role for neurotrophic factors in the development of the nervous system and in this context the term is used mostly to refer to the ability of a factor to promote survival and growth of discrete subpopulations of neurons. (The restriction to discrete subpopulations excludes general nutrients such as glucose from the definition.) In the mature nervous sys- tem, the stabilization and maintenance of neuronal popu- lations over an extended period are also recognized as important neurotrophic effects. That is, neurotrophic fac- tors may be neuroprotective and neurorestorative against injury, disease, and damage. It is this possibility, in partic- ular, that has generated interest in the potential use of such factors as therapeutic agents when neuronal function is compromised. Endogenous neurotrophic factors are mostly pro- teins but there are now a number of synthetic small molecules that mimic the actions of these endogenous factors. Neurotrophic factors, by definition, affect neurons. Normally this occurs because of a direct effect of the factor on specific neurotrophic factor receptors expressed on the neurons. But, because there are neurotrophic factor receptors on some non-neu- ronal cells, indirect actions of factors on neurons are possible. The developmental role of neurotrophic factors has been studied experimentally. Details of these effects go beyond the scope of this article, and the interested reader is referred to the literature (Bennet et al. , 2002) for a recent review. However, one important principle to emerge from these developmental studies is the neurotrophic hypothesis. This states that the survival of populations of neurons depends absolutely at some stages of development on the availability of particular factors from the targets of those neurons. This is an effi- cient mechanism for both regulating the number of neu- rons in a particular circuit and eliminating spurious or misguided projections (Bennet et al. , 2002). Particularly clear examples of the neurotrophic hypothesis are apparent for neurons of all the branches of the periph- eral nervous system—sensory, motor, and autonomic. The prototypical neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor (NGF) was identified because of its ability to promote growth of sympathetic axons and nearly all post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons are lost embry- onically in mice with a null mutation in the NGF gene, or indeed in the gene for its receptor, trkA. Motoneurons also die in the absence of trophic support normally provided by the muscles that they innervate, although there continues to be uncertainty about the factor(s) concerned. In the mature nervous system, the critical dependence for survival of peripheral neurons on target-derived neu- rotrophic factors is largely lost. Nonetheless, as we will review in this chapter, neurotrophic factors may still pro- tect neurons against cytotoxic insults, and, moreover, neurotrophic factors may offer important therapeutic opportunities that go beyond promoting survival. We will also consider some of the neurobiological roles of neurotrophic factors in mature animals and discuss how, in some contexts—notably some persistent pain states— a dysregulation of neurotrophic factor expression may be an important contributor to the pathophysiological state. In these circumstances, a therapeutic potential exists for blocking (rather than promoting) particular neurotrophic effects. 419 CHAPTER 25 Therapeutic Potential of Neurotrophic Factors Stephen McMahon, PhD Beth Murinson MD, PhD Ch25.qxd 9/2/04 10:19 AM Page 419"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"NEUROTROPHIC FACTORS AND THEIR RECEPTORS There are a number of families of neurotrophic fac- tors, but two in particular have been studied for their neuroprotective effects. These are neurotrophins and the glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family, which we will consider in turn. Neurotrophin Family This family consists of NGF, the prototypical neu- rotrophic factor that was first purified from mouse sub- mandibular gland by Levi-Montalcini, Booker, and Cohen (see Levi-Montalcini, 1987); brain-derived neu- rotrophic factor (BDNF); neurotrophin-3 (NT3); neurotrophin-4/5 (NT4/5); and neurotrophin-6 (NT6), which is only present in teleost fish (Lindsay, 1996; Gotz et al. , 1994). The neurotrophins are expressed as large precursors which, when processed, yield the highly basic mature proteins of approximately 14 kDa (approximately 120 amino acids). The different family members share around 50% amino acid homology and at physiological concentrations the neurotrophins exist as homodimers. Two different classes of neurotrophin receptor have now been characterized. The first to be identified was the so-called p75 or low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (LNGFR), which binds all the neurotrophins equally with relatively low affinity (Chao et al. , 1986). Additionally there is a family of high-affinity receptors, trks, which are tyrosine kinase receptors (Kaplan et al. , 1991). There are three known members of the trk family of receptors, termed trkA, trkB, and trkC, which show different specificities for the neurotrophins, as illustrated in Figure 25.1. NGF is the preferred ligand for trkA, BDNF and NT4/5 the preferred ligands for trkB, and NT3 the preferred ligand for trkC. NT3 appears to be somewhat less specific than the other neurotrophins and at least in vitro can activate all of the trk receptors, albeit with different potencies. The p75 receptor contains a single transmembrane seg- ment flanked by e xtracellular and intr acellular domains. The exact role of the p75 receptor is still a matter of con- tention. The p75 receptor appears to interact with trk receptors and promote the specificity and sensitivity of their interaction with the neurotrophins (Horton et al. , 1997). More recently it has been found that the precur- sors of mature NGF (preproNFG) specifically bind to p75 receptors and are retrogradely transported in neu- rons bearing p75 (Yiangou et al. , 2002), which may indi- cate novel neurotrophic roles for both p75 and higher molecular weight forms of the neurotrophins. There is now considerable information regarding the nature of signalling via neurotrophin receptors. Most of this derives from studies of PC12 cells, where neu- rotrophin binding to appropriate trk receptors leads to receptor dimerization—the critical step for receptor acti- vation. Autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues of dimerized trk receptors leads to activation of a wide number of intracellular pathways (see Kaplan and Miller, 2000 for review), which mediate neurotrophin responses both by altering gene expression and by post- translational modification of proteins in the target neu- ron. NGF binding to p75 can also lead to the activation of a number of transcription factors. Glial Cell Line–derived Neurotrophic Factor Family A second well-studied family of neurotrophic factors forms a branch of the transforming growth factor– β (TGF- β ) superfamily. The founding member was GDNF (Lin et al. , 1993). Other related members are neurturin (NTN) (Kotzbauer et al. , 1996), artemin (ART; also called neublastin) (Baloh et al. , 1998), and persephin (PSP) (Milbrandt et al. , 1998). Like the neurotrophin family, all these proteins share significant structural homology. The different factors promote survival of different subpopulations of neurons, although the functional role of persephin remains poorly defined. Members of the GDNF family signal via a receptor complex. This first consists of RET, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that acts as a signal transducing domain and, second, a member of the GFR α family of GPI-linked receptors (GFR α -1–4), which act as ligand binding domains (Figure 25.2). Either GFR α -1 or GFR α -2 in conjunction with RET can mediate GDNF or NTN signalling (although GDNF is thought to bind preferentially to GFR α -1 and NTN to GFR α -2). ART binds to GFR α -3. It is less clear if RET is always 420 Therapeutic Potential of Neurotrophic Factors trkA trkB trkC NGF BDNF NT3 NT4 p75 NTR FIGURE 25.1 The different members of the neurotrophin family, and their affinities for high-affinity trk receptors.

Recently, developing striatum has been observed to express PSP, and midbrain dopaminergic neurons GFR α -4 (Akerud et al. , 2002). All of the GFR α s show some promiscuity in their ability to bind different GDNF family members and PSP appears to be the only ligand with very selective binding preference to just one receptor. Other Factors A variety of neurotrophic factors have been studied to a more modest degree in the context of neuroprotection. The family of neuropoietic cytokines are defined by their binding to the common receptor, gp130. Members include ciliary-derived neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-11 (IL-11), oncostatin M, and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1). Some of these factors use GPI-linked binding proteins (like the GDNF family) and all use gp130 and/or the LIF-receptor β for signalling. The fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) also promote growth and survival of distinct populations of developing neurons. Interestingly, recent data suggest that some of the growth-promoting effects of FGFs are mediated by release of endogenous cannabinoids and activation of neuronal CB1 receptors (Williams et al. , 2003). There are also interesting parallels between cell adhesion molecules and neurotrophic fac- tors. The FGF receptor has been proposed to act as a receptor for growth promoted by some adhesion mole- cules (Williams et al. , 2003) and, conversely, NCAM has been suggested to form an alternative receptor for GDNF (Paratcha et al. , 2003). One of the potential lim- itations of the therapeutic uses of some of these neu- rotrophic factors, such as FGF, is their known mitogenic effects on a number of cell types. NEUROTROPHIC FACTORS AND REGENERATION Peripheral Nervous System Although often described as successful when compared with the central nervous system (CNS), regeneration in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is in reality slow and lim- ited. Proximal nerve injuries in the human arm or leg are rarely followed by reinnervation of distal structures such as the hand or foot. This is, in part, because the normal rate of axonal regeneration (approximately 1 mm/day) is so slow that irreversible muscle atrophy takes place before regenerating axons arrive. Given the profound disability resulting from this type of injury, the therapeutic opportu- nities in this area are substantial. Research to date has identified three major challenges to successful peripheral nerve repair: 1) promoting selective nerve reconnection to target tissues, 2) bridging gaps that occur as a consequence of nerve injury, and 3) increasing the number of axons that regenerate over long distances. Most large peripheral nerves are mixed nerves. This means that they contain motor, sensory, and autonomic component axons. These axons typically travel together for some distance and then separate to reach different target tissues. When mixed peripheral nerves are dis- rupted, the routing of the various component axons must be restored for functional recovery to occur. Re- establishing appropriate target innervation is an area of ongoing research discussed subsequently. Traumatic nerve injuries are classically described in three forms: neuropraxis, a temporary stunning of the nerve that is not associated with physical discontinuity; axonotmesis, discontinuity of the axon with preservation of the surrounding structures; and neurotmesis, complete transection of the nerve. This classification is useful in guiding treatment and predicting recovery in that neuro- praxis typically recovers most quickly while axonotmesis requires axonal regrowth but not axonal retargeting and can recover well. Neurotmesis injuries require surgical repair and are often associated with discontinuities between the pro ximal nerve stump and the distal nerve end. Neurotmesis injuries have received the most attention experimentally but crush injury models (axonotmesis) are frequently used as well. A second potentially important application of neu- rotrophic factors (NTFs) in the peripheral nervous sys- tem is in the treatment of peripheral neuropathies, as discussed subsequently. Neurotrophic Factors in Repair of Traumatic Nerve Injury One of the most promising strategies for promoting peripheral nerve repair is the implantation of NTF- enriched conduits. Conduits are especially attractive for Therapeutic Potential of Neurotrophic Factors 421 GDNF NTN ART PSP GFR α 1 GFR α 2 GFR α 3 GFR α 4 RET Ligand Binding protein Signalling protein FIGURE 25.2 The GDNF family of neurotrophic factors and their receptors. Ch25.qxd 9/2/04 10:19 AM Page 421"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"nerve repair applications because they can guide regener- ating fibers into a physical structure resembling the orig- inal nerve, they can be attached to both proximal and distal nerve stumps restoring continuity with the target tissues, and they may be constructed of materials con- ducive to successful regeneration. This strategy has been used with several NTFs (Terenghi, 1999). Treatment of the sciatic nerve with NGF has been reported to enhance regeneration (Fine et al. , 2002; Pu et al. , 1999; Santos et al. , 1999), but there is little support for positive effects on functional recovery (Young et al. , 2001). Indeed, one of the complications of using NGF is that there is a large body of evidence that it causes pain and hyperalgesia, as discussed subsequently. GDNF-enriched nerve conduit repairs produced remarkable regeneration of facial nerve (Barras et al ., 2002). Six weeks after repair, the number of axons in GDNF-treated nerves was 75% that of naïve control nerves while unenriched conduits showed no axons in this model. Myelination approximated the nor- mal pattern with GDNF treatment. The ratio of axonal diameter to fiber outside diameter (G ratio) was high and resembled a juvenile pattern (Midroni and Bilbao, 1995). In contrast, animals treated with NT3-enriched conduits showed less than 10% of the number of axons present in naïve nerve, the pattern of myelination was less uniform, and the total myelin thickness was less than that in GDNF-treated animals. Retrograde labelling of motoneurons that was absent in un-enriched conduit repairs was present in NT3-enriched repairs and markedly increased in GDNF-enriched repairs. These results are very encouraging but further information about the effects of various NTFs on restoration of func- tion is still needed. Moreover, successful recovery depends on re-estab- lishing connections with specific target tissues as well as vigorous axonal extension. A pure motor nerve, such as the facial nerve, may require a simpler repertoire of extension-promoting factors but nonetheless represents a complex targeting challenge; that is, correctly re- innervating a number of target muscles. This highlights the potential importance of a further observation: the finding that neutralizing antibodies to some NTFs reduced axonal branching after nerve injury. Decreasing the number of axonal branches in regenerating axons may improve functional recovery because excessive branching may be associated with reduced efficiency of target finding. Although preclinical data reveal the potential of NTFs to promote peripheral regeneration, it is less clear whether this can be translated to effective clinical therapies. One large clinical trial, to assess the potential of NGF to promote sensory regeneration in diabetic neuropathy, failed, perhaps because of the need to reduce doses to minimize pain-related side effects (Quasthoff and Hartung, 2001). Other Neurotrophic Factor Strategies for Peripheral Nerve Repair The transfer of Schwann cells, particularly pre-dener- vated Schwann cells, is a strategy that may promote regen- eration. Experimental evidence indicates that there is an optimal period after nerve injury (between 3 and 10 days after axotomy) when Schwann cells and factors in the dis- tal stump are especially conducive to nerve regeneration. Cells and factors harvested in the acute period are not as effective; materials obtained at late time periods (weeks to months after injury) are also not as supportive of re- growth (Marcol et al. , 2003). The transplantation of stem cells is a strategy that may be especially useful when nerve continuity is preserved. The idea of introducing stem cells at the regenerating nerve tip is based on the observation that stem cells or juvenile cells produce factors, including NTFs, that will promote nerve regeneration. In addition to this, stem cells can be genetically modified to produce increased levels of specific NTFs. Clinical and Experimental Models of Peripheral Neuropathy The implementation of the skin biopsy for assessment of epidermal nerve fiber density has revolutionized clini- cal assessment of peripheral neuropathy. A 3-mm full- thickness skin punch biopsy is obtained, stained for the pan-axonal marker PGP9.5 and systematically evaluated. The incision site heals spontaneously with few complica- tions. The introduction of a method for rapid and repeat- able assessment of small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers in humans has opened a new diagnostic window for peripheral nerve disease. Small fiber neuropathies, most commonly diabetic and pre-diabetic neuropathies, have been highly resistant to traditional methods of eval- uating nerve disease: Nerve conduction studies assess large fiber function and fail to detect small-fiber pre- dominant neuropathies until they are far advanced. Other methods are even less ideal; nerve biopsies are invasive and cumbersome; microneurography is poten- tially damaging and restricted to expert research studies; and quantitative sensory testing, while useful, is not con- sistently predictive of neuropathology. In humans, evaluation of epidermal nerve fiber den- sity by skin biopsy (Figure 25.3) has shown that there is a normal gradient of innervation density. Proximal struc- tures such as back and proximal thigh have a higher number of epidermal nerve fibers than distal ankle; addi- tionally there is a gradual decrease in fiber density with advancing age (McCarthy et al. , 1995). In patients with small fiber neuropathy, epidermal nerve fibers are reduced or absent, more so distally. Two main approaches have been taken to study regeneration using 422 Therapeutic Potential of Neurotrophic Factors Ch25.qxd 9/2/04 10:19 AM Page 422"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"skin biopsy: incision-reincision and capsaicin denerva- tion. In the incision-reincision model, a 3-mm skin punch is followed weeks later by a 5-mm skin punch that includes the first biopsy site. Studies of these tissues show that epidermal fibers extend into the injury site along the dermal-epidermal junction. Repair from deeper dermal structures is limited by dense collagen scarring. In the capsaicin denervation model, an occlusive dressing of capsaicin cream remains in place for 24 hours. This is well tolerated in clinical trials and produces a patch of anesthetic skin with no epidermal nerve fibers. There is some depletion of dermal nerve fibers as well. Using this technique, recent studies have shown that diabetics regen- erate nerve less quickly after a denervating injury. Several animal studies have shown that NGF is able to promote an apparently complete reinnervation of skin after cap- saicin treatment (Schicho et al. , 1999, and references therein). However, clinical trials that used skin biopsy as an endpoint for NGF treatment of peripheral neuropa- thy failed to demonstrate any improvement in epidermal nerve fiber density, again perhaps because of the neces- sity to limit NGF dose (Quasthoff and Hartung, 2001). Neuropathic pain frequently arises because of lesions to the peripheral nervous system. There are many precipitating causes, some metabolic (e.g., diabetes melli- tus), some infectious (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus), some iatrogenic (e.g., secondary to cancer chemotherapy), and some traumatic (for instance, follow- ing accident or surgery). There has been extensive exper- imental study of painful neuropathic states, particularly those created by traumatic nerve injuries that result in a partial denervation of a major target such as the hindlimb (see McMahon, 2002, for review). We have shown that GDNF treatment can prevent the develop ment of neuropathic pain and reverse an established painful state in several rodent models (Boucher et al. , 2000). Those experiments suggested one key mechanism of action resulted from the ability of GDNF to reverse the upregulation of a sodium channel transcript, Na v 1.3, in damaged nerve, and there are several other reports also showing the ability of neurotophic factors to regulate sodium channel expression in primary sensory neurons (Cummins et al. , 2000; Leffler et al. , 2002). Abnormal sodium channel expression itself is likely to contribute to the emergence of ectopic activity in dam- aged neurons that is known to be essential for the normal expression of neuropathic behavior. Several other groups have subsequently reported similar anti-neuropathic actions of GDNF (Hao et al. , 2003; Wang et al. , 2003). Another member of the GDNF family, artemin, has also been reported to have anti-allodynic effects in preclinical models of neuropathic pain (Gardell et al. , 2003). Central Nervous System The growth-promoting effects of neurotrophic factors on neurons of the peripheral nervous system naturally raise the question of whether these same factors might be of use in promoting regeneration in the central nervous system. Whereas the peripheral nervous system will spontaneously regenerate (albeit frequently with only limited functional recovery, as described above) the cen- tral nervous system does not, at least in mature mam- mals. And while there is increased understanding of the reasons for this failure of CNS regeneration, the absence of existing clinical therapies for these disorders acts a strong stimulus for the development of novel strategies. Here we will review the preclinical data relating to the potential therapeutic benefits of neurotrophic factor treat- ment in two contexts of CNS regeneration: regeneration of sensory neurons at the dorsal root entry zone and regenera- tion within the damaged spinal cord. The potential use of these factors in neurodegenerative disease is briefly reviewed later in this chapter. The reader is also referred to Chapter 15 by Tuszynski in this volume for a fuller discus- sion of emerging therapies for these conditions. Regeneration at the Dorsal Root Entry Zone The dorsal root entry zone (DREZ), also known as the transitional zone (TZ), is the specialized interface where the dorsal roots join the spinal cord (Fraher, 2000; Ramer et al. , 2001b; Ramer et al. , 2001b). At the DREZ, periph- eral sensory axons penetrate the glia limitans—the astro- cyte layer that covers the surface of the CNS—to enter the spinal cord. The DREZ delimits the characteristic myelin- forming cells of the CNS (oligodendrocytes) from those of the PNS (Schwann cells).

The reason for failure is believed to be the postnatal expression of inhibitory molecules within the DREZ (Pindzola et al. , 1993; Zhang et al. , 1995) as well as developmental changes in the response of sensory axons to such molecules (Golding et al. , 1997). Traumatic injuries, frequently asso- ciated with motorcycle accidents, can cause dorsal root avulsions in humans. In these cases, most commonly involving the brachial plexus, sensory input is lost and this additionally limits motor performance. Many avulsion injuries also lead to quite intractable chronic pain. Significant numbers of babies suffer from root avulsion injuries during childbirth—more than suffer from spina bifida, for instance—and these palsies usually leave persist- ent deficits. There is clearly an unmet clinical need associ- ated with these conditions. Several attempts to bypass the inhibitory DREZ have been explored. These include the use of peripheral nerve grafts (Oudega et al. , 1994; Saiz-Sapena et al. , 1997), col- lagen guidance channels (Liu et al. , 1997; Liu et al. , 1998c), and grafts of fetal spinal cord (Itoh et al. , 1992; Itoh et al. , 1993) as bridges between severed dorsal roots and the spinal gray matter. These attempts are reported to result in some limited regeneration of adult sensory axons across the DREZ, but the degree of recovery is probably insufficient to be of any clinical benefit. Transplants of olfactory ensheathing cells (a specialized type of CNS glia which, uniquely, support the sponta- neous turnover of CNS olfactory neurons) into the dor- sal horn are also reported to promote the ingrowth of sensory axons and restitution of spinal reflexes (Navarro et al. , 1999; Ramon-Cueto and Nieto-Sampedro, 1994). More recently, others have not been able to show any positive effects of this treatment (Riddell et al. , 2002). Conditioning lesions to a peripheral nerve, which switch on the neuron’s regenerative machinery, accelerate regen- eration within the dorsal root (Richardson and Verge, 1987) and result in the penetration of the DREZ by a few axons (Chong et al. , 1999). These experiments indicate that neutralization of inhibitory CNS molecules is not necessarily required for penetration of the DREZ by sensory axons. We and others have therefore investigated whether neurotrophic factors can promote the regeneration of damaged dorsal root axons across the DREZ. In our experiments, multiple cervical dorsal root crushes (Ramer et al. , 2000) or cuts (Ramer et al. , 2001b) were carried out and neurotrophic factors were delivered intrathecally by osmotic minipump. We observed that neurotrophic factors do indeed promote a robust regen- eration of damaged dorsal root axons across the DREZ, and that the populations of axons that regenerate corre- spond to the known pattern of neurotrophic factor receptor expression (Ramer et al. , 2000). That is, NGF selectively promoted the in-growth of small diameter CGRP-expressing axons, NT3 promoted the in-growth of large diameter NF200-expressing axons, and GDNF promoted the regeneration of both small diameter P2X3- expressing axons and a subset of large diameter NF200- positive fibers. An example is shown in Figure 25.4. We have recently confirmed this regeneration into CNS tissue in a stereological electron microscopy (EM) study (Ramer et al. , 2002), which indicated that NT3 treatment produced a growth of approximately 40% of axons across the DREZ. It also showed that some of the centrally regenerated fibers became re-myelinated. Functional connectivity of the regenerated primary afferent fibers with postsynaptic dorsal horn neurons was also demonstrated in electrophysiological experi- ments. NGF and GDNF treatment resulted in the reap- pearance of long-latency postsynaptic responses, reflective of the regeneration of small caliber afferent fibers, while NT3 and GDNF restored short-latency potentials, consistent with regeneration and re-connec- tion of large caliber A-fibers with dorsal horn neurons. Most importantly, the regeneration associated with trophic factor treatment improved the sensory behavior of the animals: rats treated with NGF and GDNF recovered behavioral sensitivity to noxious thermal and mechanical stimulation. Rats treated with NT3 and GDNF showed improvements in some sensory-motor tasks, such as locomotion across narrow beams. The B fragment of cholera toxin (CTB) binds to the GM1 ganglioside expressed specifically by myelinated axons and CTB can be used to trace the anatomical pro- jections of these large caliber axons. Myelinated axons normally terminate in lamina I and III-X of the dorsal horn, and are excluded from lamina II. NT3 promotes the regeneration of CTB-labelled axons through the entry zone and into the superficial part of the dorsal horn 1 week following rhizotomy. Many axons can also be found growing along the pia mater, possibly as a result of a tropic effect of NT3 combined with the growth- permissive meningeal surface of the spinal cord. With EM, CTB-labelled axons and vesicle-filled terminals appear within the superficial laminae of the gray matter as early as 1 week following rhizotomy and NT3 treat- ment. Normally, large diameter afferent fibers terminate not only in the dorsal horn, but they also send ascending branches toward the brainstem in the posterior columns, to terminate in the dorsal column nuclei. Following NT3 treatment, rather than growing along their usual course, regenerating axons grow rostro-caudally in the superficial gray matter. This is probably due to the preference of growing axons for gray matter rather than white matter, as has been shown in tissue culture experiments (Savio and Schwab, 1989), and/or the presence of degenerating 424 Therapeutic Potential of Neurotrophic Factors Ch25.qxd 9/2/04 10:19 AM Page 424"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"myelin within the dorsal columns. Other laboratories have also seen sensory regeneration across the adult DREZ under the influence of neurotrophic factors. Romero et al. (Romero et al. , 2000; Romero et al. , 2001) also reported that trophic factors induced the ingrowth of sensory neu- rons to the spinal cord following rhizotomy. In these experiments, adenoviral vectors were used to transduce spinal cord cells (principally astrocytes) with a transgene making one of several factors. The ingrowth of sensory axons seen with this approach was extensive, and some regenerated fibers were found at ectopic locations. Together, these data strongly suggest the possible use of such factors in the repair of dorsal root avulsion injuries in man. However, there are several caveats. Neurotrophic factors may induce sprouting of intact sen- sory neurons, especially when delivered at high doses, and by this or other mechanisms (McMahon and Bennett, 1999) might result in abnormal pain sensitivity if noci- ceptive afferent fibers are targeted. This approach might be more useful for restoring tactile and proprioceptive information. We found that if NT3 treatment is delayed after a dorsal rhizotomy, axons are able to cross the DREZ, but their progress through the degenerating white matter portion of the root is more restricted (Ramer et al. , 2001a) and many regenerating axons form large dystrophic end-bulbs, and they show an attenuated course. Analysis of the time course of glial events fol- lowing rhizotomy indicated that the emergence of this abortive growth most closely matched the appearance within the white matter of mature ED1-expressing phagocytic cells, rather than astrogliosis or microglial proliferation, both of which are well under way by the second day following a dorsal root lesion (Liu et al. , 1998b). Because the peripheral part of the root is heavily laden with macrophages, the abortive regeneration is not likely to be a direct result of the mere presence of phago- cytic cells. In the periphery, macrophages rapidly clear myelin, and thus aid in the regenerative process. In the CNS, myelin clearance is a much more protracted process (George and Griffin, 1994), probably a result of failure of Therapeutic Potential of Neurotrophic Factors 425 FIGURE 25.4 Regeneration of sensory neurons under the influence of NT3. Sensory axons were labelled with an anterograde tracer, shown in white. In intact animals (top left), the label shows the normal central termination pattern of myelinated fibers in the deeper laminae of the dorsal horn. After lesions of the dorsal root (top right) axons regenerate to the DREZ but do not cross it. When rhizotomyis combined with intrathecal NT3 treatment (bottom), many myelinated fibers are induced to grow across the DREZ (yellow dotted lines) and grow into the spinal cord.

Once the process of myelin clear ance commences in the cord, it appears to create a second inhibitory boundary for regenerating sensory neurons, and one which is not so amenable to neurotrophic factor treatment. Thus, these factors alone may be most effective if delivered immediately after injury. Regeneration in the Spinal Cord Damage to the spinal cord may result in the death of neurons, which are not replaced, and severance of axons, which do not regenerate. A delayed phase of cell death is seen after many injuries that may be secondary to inflam- matory products produced at the injury site, or second- ary to the failure of regeneration of damaged axons and the associated long-term loss of trophic support nor- mally provided by the targets of these axonal projections. One reason for the failure of regeneration is that the CNS, as opposed to the PNS, is rich in several myelin associated inhibitory molecules, such as NOGO and MAG (McGee and Strittmatter, 2003). A second impor- tant reason is that direct damage to the spinal cord is associated with the formation of a glial scar, in which reactive astrocytes, in particular, create a dense and highly inhibitory barrier at the site of injury. Nonetheless, given the very positive effects of trophic factors described pre- viously, it is reasonable to ask if these factors might be neuroprotective or neurorestorative in the context of spinal cord injuries. This question has been addressed experimentally quite intensively over the past 5 years or so. There are consis- tent reports that several neurotrophic factors, delivered in different ways and following different types of spinal cord injury can prevent the atrophy and cell death of a variety of neuronal subpopulations (Baumgartner and Shine, 1998; Baumgartner and Shine, 1997; Blesch and Tuszynski, 2001; Giehl and Tetzlaff, 1996; Kobayashi et al. , 1997a; Lu et al. , 2001; Liu et al. , 2002; Novikova et al. , 2002; Bradbury et al. , 1998; Koda et al. , 2002). The most successfully used trophic factors are NT3, BDNF, and GDNF. These factors have been delivered to the sites of spinal injury or to the cell bodies of damaged neurons, by various techniques including single depot provision, continuous infusion, genetically altered cells, or follow- ing transduction with viral vectors. Both ascending and descending spinal tracts, including the corticospinal and rubrospinal systems, are protected. The protection can last for many weeks or months. The ability of the same factors to promote regenera- tion of damaged neurons (rather than protect against cell death) has also been extensively studied, but with mixed results. The most positive studies report a local prolifera- tion of axonal sprouts at the injury sites, or an increased regeneration of CNS axons into a more favorable envi- ronment—typically a peripheral nerve segment grafted into the CNS lesion site (Grill et al. , 1997; Hiebert et al. , 2002; Kobayashi et al. , 1997b; Blits et al. , 2000; Hiebert et al. , 2002; Weidner et al. , 1999; Tuszynski et al. , 2002a; Bradbury et al. , 1999; Oudega and Hagg, 1999; Jin et al. , 2002; Novikova et al. , 2002). The ability of neurotrophic factors to induce long-range regeneration of damaged spinal tracts across a lesion site and into and through intact tissue, appears very much more limited. Some studies have failed to see any such growth (Bradbury et al. , 1999; Blits et al. , 2003), whereas others have seen for the most part growth of very small numbers of fibers (Grill et al. , 1997; Oudega and Hagg, 1999; Tuszynski et al. , 2003; Jin et al. , 2002; Cheng et al. , 1996; Schnell et al. , 1994). The failure to induce robust long range regeneration does not appear to be a reflection of limited tests of different factors, models, neuronal subpopula- tions, etc., because equivalent experiments have shown neuroprotection or local (non-regenerative) sprouting of damaged axons. Notwithstanding this relatively poor anatomical response, neurotrophic factors have been reported to improve behavioral performance in many studies. One possible explanation is that small numbers of regenerated axons support significant behavioral response. Another is that the trophic factors are inducing functional change in undamaged neuronal systems. Recently, there has been some enthusiasm for notion that these factors (and indeed other treatments) induce sprouting of intact neuronal systems that might con- tribute to behavioral improvements (e.g., Jeffery and Fitzgerald, 2001; Zhou et al. , 2003; Zhou and Shine, 2003). The full extent of this sprouting is only now being explored, and indeed, whether such sprouts make mal- adaptive as well as adaptive connections is yet to be tested. Another possible effect of trophic factor treat- ment is an indirect action via non-neuronal cells. This is suggested in some of the cases cited above where factors appear to promote sprouting or growth of neuronal populations that do not have the appropriate neu- rotrophic factor receptor, and also for instance by the anti-apoptotic effects on oligodendrocytes (Koda et al. , 2002). The highly consistent, if limited, positive effects of neurotrophic factors, on spinal cord injuries, suggest they may find some use in the clinic. However, the existing preclinical data would not suggest that alone these fac- tors will promote dramatic recovery. It seems much more likely that effective spinal cord injury treatments will require multiple interventions, and these are only now being explored at a preclinical level. There are other potential problems particularly associated with trophic factors. The overwhelming use of rodents as preclinical models (but see Tuszynski et al. , 2002b, for an example of 426 Therapeutic Potential of Neurotrophic Factors Ch25.qxd 9/2/04 10:19 AM Page 426"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"a primate study) may not translate well to humans where the absolute distances needed for restitution of damaged tracts are so much greater. There is also the possibility that high concentrations of trophic factors may act as a sink for growing axons, promoting growth but trapping the regrowing axons in the vicinity of treatment. Finally, it may not prove easy to use the natural proteins as therapeutics because of problems associated with delivery. NEUROTROPHIC FACTORS AND CHRONIC PAIN Nerve Growth Factor as a Peripheral Inflammatory Mediator The administration of small doses of NGF to adult animals and humans can produce pain and hyperalgesia. In rodents, a thermal hyperalgesia is present within 30 min- utes of systemic NGF administration and both a thermal and a mechanical hyperalgesia after a couple of hours (Lewin et al., 1993). In humans, intravenous injections of very low doses of NGF produce widespread aching pains in deep tissues and hyperalgesia at the injection site (Petty et al. , 1994). The rapid onset of some of these effects, and their localization to the injection site, strongly suggests that they arise at least in part from a local effect on the peripheral terminals of nociceptors. This has been sub- stantiated by the observation that acute administration of NGF can sensitize nociceptive afferent fibers to thermal and chemical stimuli (Rueff and Mendell, 1996). Much of this sensitization appears to be a direct action on primary afferent nociceptors, many of which express trkA. The intracellular pathways concerned have been much studied but with conflicting results (see Bonnington and McNaughton, 2003). However, there is evidence that some of the sensitizing effects of NGF are indirect, via mast cells, sympathetic efferent neurons, and neutrophils (see McMahon and Bennett, 1999 for review). NGF is a potent regulator of gene expression in sensory neurons. Some sensory neuropeptides, which are released with activity from central nociceptor terminals, are strongly upregulated by NGF. These include CGRP and substance P. NGF has also been shown to produce a dra- matic upregulation of BDNF in trkA-expressing DRG cells, and there is now growing evidence that BDNF may serve as a central regulator of excitability, as discussed sub- sequently. NGF regulates the expression of some of the receptors expressed by nociceptors. Capsaicin sensitivity is increased in vivo by NGF, which results from the regulation of the heat transducer TRPV1 (formerly VR1). Finally, several ion channels, such as Na v 1.8 are strongly regulated by NGF availability. The dramatic effects of exogenously administered NGF on pain signaling systems does not reveal the role of endogenous NGF. To ascertain if any of the pharmaco- logical effects of NGF truly reflect those of endogenous NGF, one must perform experiments in which the bio- logical actions of endogenous NGF are somehow blocked. This has been achieved by two major experi- mental approaches: targeted recombination in embryonic stem cells to selectively knock out either NGF or its receptor trkA, and the administration of proteins that inhibit the bioactivity of NGF. Each of these techniques has advantages and disadvantages, but studies using them largely confirm an important role for endogenous NGF in regulating pain sensitivity. The knock-out approach has provided information particularly regard- ing the developmental role of NGF and has confirmed that essentially all spinal nociceptive afferent fibers require this factor for survival in the perinatal period. Because mice with NGF or trkA deletions rarely sur- vive past the first postnatal week, most of what we know about endogenous NGF function in the adult has been determined by the use of blocking agents. There have been a number of studies using a synthetic chimeric pro- tein consisting of the extracellular domain of trkA fused to the Fc tail of human immunoglobulin (trkA-IgG). Local infusion of trkA-IgG into the rat hindpaw leads to thermal hypoalgesia and a decrease in CGRP content in those DRG neurons projecting to the infused area (McMahon et al. , 1995). These changes take several days to develop. In addition, there is a decrease in the thermal and chemical sensitivity of nocicep tors projecting to the area and a decrease in the epidermal innervation density. These results provide strong evidence that NGF contin- ues to play an important role in regulating the function of the small, peptidergic sensory neurons in the adult. Finally, there is now compelling evidence that the biol- ogy of NGF described previously is particularly impor- tant in many forms of inflammation. NGF is found in many cell types in tissues subject to inflammatory insult, and much evidence now supports the hypothesis that up- regulation of NGF levels is a common component of the inflammatory response that relates to hyperalgesia. Elevated NGF levels have been found in a variety of inflammatory states in both humans and animal models (see McMahon and Bennett, 1999). There is now wide- spread agreement that blocking NGF bioactivity (either systemically or locally) largely blocks the effects of inflammation on sensory nerve function. For instance, intraplantar injection of carrageenan produces an acute inflammatory reaction, which has previously been widely used in the study of the analgesic effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. When trkA-IgG was coadmin- istered with carrageenan, it could largely prevent the development of the thermal hyperalgesia that normally develops (McMahon et al. , 1995), and the sensitization of primary afferent nociceptors. There are now many Therapeutic Potential of Neurotrophic Factors 427 Ch25.qxd 9/2/04 10:19 AM Page 427"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"other similar examples. IL-1 β and TNF α have been shown to mediate changes in NGF expression during inflammation in vivo and the hyperalgesia produced by these cytokines can be prevented by NGF antagonism. Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor as a Central Pain Neuromodulator Neurotrophic factors are best known for their roles as secreted factors, both during development (as target- derived survival factors) and in the adult. But there is now a growing body of evidence that at least one of the neu- rotrophins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), may act as a neuromodulator. That is, in some neurons, BDNF does not enter the secretory pathway but instead is packaged in synaptic vesicles and is released with neu- ronal activity to modulate postsynaptic neurons. Such a role has been suggested in hippocampus, cortex, cerebel- lum, and spinal cord (McAllister et al. , 1999; Malcangio and Lessmann, 2003). Here we will consider the role of BDNF in nociceptive processing. This protein is constitutively expressed in a significant minority of small and medium-sized sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) (Zhou and Rush, 1996; Barakat-Walter, 1996) where it is contained in dense-core vesicles. Moreover, it is dramatically up- regulated in many small diameter nociceptive sensory neurons in models of inflammatory pain and in larger neurons in some animal models of neuropathic pain (Michael et al. , 1999; Michael et al. , 1997; Zhou et al. , 1999; Ha et al. , 2001). One important trigger for the increased synthesis of BDNF in nociceptive neurons is the peripheral increase in NGF availability that is a com- mon feature of inflammation (see previous discussion). BDNF is known to be released from the central terminals of sensory neurons with activity, and in a frequency- dependent manner (Balkowiec and Katz, 2000). In nor- mal tissue, release is associated specifically with activity in nociceptors, either induced by chemical algogens such as capsaicin, or by electrical stimulation of, specifically, small diameter sensory neurons. Interestingly, the pat- terns of electrical activity necessary for BDNF are dif- ferent from those producing release of other sensory neuron transmitters such as glutamate and substance P (Lever et al. , 2001). High-affinity receptors for BDNF (the tyrosine kinase receptor trkB) are widely expressed on spinal neurons including spinal projection neurons. We have recently shown that nociceptor activation in a variety of experi- mental preparations leads to activation (phosphorylation) of dorsal horn trkB receptors, indicating that BDNF can be released from nociceptors and activate postsynaptic neurons (Pezet et al. , 2002a). We have also shown that intrathecally injected BDNF can also induce ERK phosphorylation in laminae I–II neurons of the spinal cord (Pezet et al. , 2002a), and this kinase is known to be an important second messenger in mediating some changes in spinal nociceptive processing associated with persistent pain states (Ji et al. , 1999). In other experi- ments, we finally showed that endogenous BDNF release from nociceptors accounts for approximately one third of the activation of ERK (Pezet et al. , 2002b). Thus, there is a body of biochemical evidence implicating BDNF as a pain-related central modulator. There are also functional studies demonstrating the neuromodulatory role of BDNF in the spinal cord. Exogenous BDNF selectively enhances sensory neuron–evoked spinal reflex activity and NMDA-induced depolarization of in vitro preparation of rat spinal cord (Kerr et al. , 1999; Thompson et al. , 1999). Recently, BDNF null mutant mice have been shown to display a selective deficit in the ventral root potentials evoked by nociceptive primary afferent fibers (Heppenstall and Lewin, 2001). In adult rats, intrathecal injection of anti-BDNF antibodies or sequestering fusion molecule TrkB-IgG prevented the development of thermal hyperalgesia associated with acute peripheral inflammation (Kerr et al. , 1999) or neu- ropathic pain (Fukuoka et al. , 2001), respectively. It is not clear what the intracellular mechanism is of BDNF- induced modulation. One straightforward possibility is that synaptically released BDNF activates the map kinase ERK in second-order cells and this second messenger pro- duces a post-translational change in NMDA receptor properties. Whatever the mechanism, there is a clearly doc- umented pathway linking nociceptor activity with BDNF- mediated central modulation of sensory transmission. It is not clear at present when this pathway is active. The data so far suggest that it is one important mediator of central sensitization and might therefore contribute to a variety of hyperalgesic states. BDNF therefore joins a list of promis- ing new targets for analgesic drug development. OTHER POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS OF NEUROTROPHIC FACTORS The role of NTFs in the treatment of CNS neurode- generative disorders is varied. In some disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, GDNF holds clear promise. In Alzheimer’s disease, the potential benefit of NTFs is unclear; in Huntington’s disease, BDNF has been impli- cated in the disease process; and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, there is hope that selected NTFs may forestall or reverse disease progression. All of these hopes spring from the basic biology of neurotrophic factors—that they are neuroprotective and neurorestorative for selected pop- ulations of neurons. Despite the potent effects that have been demonstrated in culture or preclinical models, it 428 Therapeutic Potential of Neurotrophic Factors Ch25.qxd 9/2/04 10:19 AM Page 428"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"remains a sobering fact that there are no current clinically proven applications for neurotrophic factors.

Their growth cones sense attractive and repulsive cues from the extracellular milieu and guide growing axons to appropriate partners. Once the critical period for the formation of specific connec- tions ends, CNS plasticity within higher vertebrates is greatly diminished. A clinical consequence of limited adult CNS axonal extension is that patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) generally experience little functional recovery and suffer from permanent functional deficits. In SCI, axonal interruption at one spinal level is the primary cause of dysfunction. Loss of function in lower spinal segments occurs despite the survival of ros- tral and caudal neurons controlling these segments. Disconnection is the proximate cause of clinical deficits in SCI. Similarly, limited CNS axonal growth and plasticity are likely to restrict recovery from brain trauma, stroke, and chronic progressive multiple sclerosis. For head trauma, a range of mechanisms explains persistent func- tional deficits. Focal parenchymal damage and hemor- rhage cause direct neuronal cell loss. In addition, diffuse axonal injury produces neuronal disconnection. For stroke, recovery of function over months following ischemia is largely dependent on the success or failure of plasticity in the brain. For chronic progressive multiple sclerosis, axonal disconnection rather than demyelination is now recognized as the best clinical correlate of disabil- ity. This review focuses on SCI. In contrast to the CNS, peripheral nervous system (PNS) axons maintain their plasticity beyond the devel- opmental phase and remain capable of axonal regenera- tion after injury. A priori , the difference between PNS and CNS regenerative capacities may be attributed to the innate differences between CNS and PNS neurons, to the environmental differences presented by CNS glia and PNS Schwann cells or a combination of both (see Figure 26.1). To address the relative importance of these factors, Aguayo and colleagues grafted sciatic nerve segments as bridges between the medulla and spinal cord and reported that CNS axons can grow through a PNS bridge (David and Aguayo, 1981). This landmark experiment proves that the CNS environment suppresses axonal regeneration, but in a permissive PNS environment, many CNS axons can regenerate. Recently, progress has been made in identifying the molecular determinants promoting and inhibiting CNS axonal regeneration. As we better understand how these determinants function, pharmacological agents can be screened and medical treatments can be devised for the new therapeutic modal- ity of axon regeneration in neuro-recovery. CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM REGENERATION SIGNALS CNS regeneration can result from the promotion or antagonism of four interdependent signal classes—extrin- sic (glial) stimulatory, extrinsic (glial) inhibitory, intrinsic (neuronal) stimulatory, and intrinsic (neuronal) inhibitory. In the design of a therapeutic strategy for SCI, the modu- lation of these four signal types should be considered with respect to their relative contributions, accessibility to mod- ulating agents, and side effects. Transplantation studies, pharmacological agents disrupting a specific signaling pathway, knockout and treatment animal models have 433 CHAPTER 26 Promoting the Regeneration of Axons within the Central Nervous System James H.

PROMOTING EXTRINSIC STIMULATORY FACTORS Diffusible Neurotrophic Factors Because the CNS and PNS differ in their expression of neurotrophic factors after axotomy, it has been hypothesized that if PNS expression of neurotrophic factors (such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF], nerve growth factor [NGF], and NT-3) is mim- icked in the CNS, then regeneration of injured CNS axons will be promoted. Of the several neurotrophic fac- tors such as BDNF and NGF characterized in in vitro studies, NT-3 has shown beneficial in vivo effects in SCI animal injury models (Schnell et al. , 1994). In adult rats with lesioned spinal cord tracts , local injection of NT-3 promotes corticospinal (CST) sprouting and in some cases long-distance regeneration. One proposed mecha- nism by which NT-3 promotes regeneration is the up reg- ulation of regeneration-associated gene (RAG) expression, which will be discussed later, within the cell bodies of injured axons. Extracellular Matrix–Associated Factors The majority of extracellular matrix (ECM)/regenera- tion studies have focused on laminin-1 (LM1), the classic growth-promoting matrix molecule, mediating cell attachment and stimulating motility (Condic and Lemons, 2002). Laminin is a trimeric extracellular matrix molecule consisting of α , β , and γ subunits. Numerous genes encoding laminin have been characterized, with greater than 15 unique laminin trimers expressed in tis- sue. However, some laminin isoforms, such as s-laminins, do not promote neurite extension and act as inhibitory signals. It is now recognized that different laminin 434 Promoting the Regeneration of Axons within the Central Nervous System Axotomy Central Nervous System Peripheral Nervous System Failed axonal regeneration Successful axonal regeneration CSPG Myelin-derived inhibition Glial Scar Reactive Astrocytes RAG induction Schwann Cell proliferation Macrophage clearance FIGURE 26.1 Cellular basis of the CNS and PNS response to axotomy. Following injury, central nervous sys- tem and peripheral nervous system axons have markedly different axon regenerative responses. CNS axons do not regenerate due to inhibition by myelin and glial scars. In addition, CNS axons lack the RAG induction, macrophage clearance, and Schwann cell proliferation found in PNS regeneration.

Data indicate that laminin’s growth-promoting characteristics can partially counter the effects of CNS inhibitors from oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. Clinical Applications For the previously mentioned extrinsic factors, ade- quate delivery and penetration play a critical role in their efficacy.

Novel materials such as hydrogels primed with neurotrophic growth factors also stimulate recovery in animal injury models. These findings highlight the potential of identifying an optimal combination of neurotrophic factors and delivery methods for enhancing growth of injured CNS axons. However, the challenge in all these treatment modalities is managing extrinsic inhibition from glial scar tissue formation and myelin. Optimal axon growth through an implant requires growth into normal CNS tissue to restore function. OVERCOMING EXTRINSIC INHIBITORY FACTORS The classic nerve graft mentioned at the outset emphasizes the critical role of extrinsic inhibition of CNS regeneration. Two principal extrinsic factors recog- nized as inhibitors of CNS axonal regeneration are the glial scar (Davies et al. , 1997) and CNS myelin (Niederost et al. , 1999) itself. Glial Scar Formation Following most if not all CNS injuries, proliferating astrocytes create a glial scar over several weeks that mechanically and biochemically blocks axonal regenera- tion. Tightly interdigitating astrocytic processes are thought to create a mechanical barrier for axonal regen- eration (Fawcett and Asher, 1999). Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG) act as the principal known bio- chemical barrier. Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans CSPGs are either membrane-bound or extracellular matrix glycoproteins that inhibit neurite growth in vitro and are up-regulated after CNS injury (Snow et al. , 1990). Specific CSPGs that increase after injury include NG2, neurocan, versican, aggrecan, and brevican (Lemons et al. , 1999). NG2 appears to be the major CSPG con- stituent at SCI sites (Fidler et al. , 1999; Dou and Levine, 1994; Fidler et al. , 1999). One study attributes CSPG inhibitory activity to the core protein. However, assigning the functional region of CSPG may not be as straightfor- ward because similar sugar structures and chondroiti- nase digestion experiments emphasize the need for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains for axonal inhibi- tion (Jones et al. , 2003). Interestingly, growing axons after injury in vivo can be associated with inhibitory CSPG substrates. Schwann cells and endothelial cells not only produce inhibitory CSPGs but also permissive cell adhesion molecules such as laminin that promote axonal regeneration. This sug- gests that axonal regeneration is dependent on a balance between positive and negative cues at localized sites. Presently, the molecular basis of CSPG action and a neu- ronal receptor for CSPG, if it exists, have not yet been described. Myelin-Associated Inhibitors Age Matters During development, embryonic neurons are sensitive to the guidance class molecules such as semaphorins, slits, netrins, and ephrins (Wang and Anderson, 1997) but are not sensitive for CNS myelin inhibition. Postnatally, neurons become more sensitive to CNS myelin–derived inhibitors, of which three, Nogo, MAG, and OMgp, have been well characterized. The age- dependent myelin sensitivity has been explained both by postnatal decrease in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and an increase in CNS myelin inhibitor recep- tors (NgR, see subsequent discussion). Although the rel- ative contribution of each of these myelin-associated inhibitors has been only partially assessed, multiple inhibitors may have developed during evolution to ensure CNS axonal pattern stabilization. Therefore blockade of any single inhibitory system may be expected to result in partial relief from myelin-based inhibition of axon growth. Three Myelin-associated Inhibitors and Their Receptor Nogo In 1988, Schwab and colleagues raised a monoclonal antibody (IN-1) against an SDS fraction of myelin that exerted strong inhibitory activity in both 3T3 fibroblast spreading and neurite outgrowth (Caroni and Schwab, 1988a). IN-1 recognizes two inhibitory bands from rat brain myelin with molecular weights of 250 kD (NI (Neurite outgrowth inhibitor)-250) and 35 kD (NI-35) (Caroni and Schwab, 1988b). Twelve years later, three groups independently cloned the gene for NI-250 and termed it nogo (Huber and Schwab, 2000; GrandPre et al. , 2000; Chen et al. , 2000). Three Nogo protein isoforms, which are all expressed in neurons, have been identified—Nogo A (1192 residues), B (373 residues), and C (199 residues). Of the three iso- forms, Nogo-A is exclusively expressed in oligodendro- cytes, whereas Nogo B and Nogo C can also be found in kidney/lung and skeletal muscle, respectively. Because of 436 Promoting the Regeneration of Axons within the Central Nervous System Ch26.qxd 9/1/04 6:53 AM Page 436"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"Nogo-A’s concentration in oligodendrocytes, it has been the focus for investigating myelin-associated inhibition. Histological analysis reveals Nogo-A to be mainly local- ized in the endoplasmic reticulum but is also expressed at the surface of oligodendrocytes. It has been hypothesized that CNS injury increases the exposure of Nogo-A to the extracellular environment (Oertle et al. , 2003). Primary sequence analysis indicates that Nogo-A lacks a signal sequence and contains two internal hydrophobic domains. Functional studies demonstrate the presence of at least two inhibitory domains: a Nogo- A specific N-terminal domain and a pan-isoform 66 residue loop domain separating the two hydrophobic domains, termed Nogo-66 (Fournier et al. , 2001). The Nogo-A specific N-terminal domain serves as growth cone collapsing agent and an inhibitory substrate for both neuronal (primary neurons and PC-12 cells) and non-neuronal (fibroblasts) cells (Chen et al. , 2000; Prinjha et al. , 2000). Although sequence and immunohistochemical analy- ses predict the topology of the Nogo-A to have the 66- residue loop at the extracellular or luminal side and the rest of the protein in the cytoplasm, alternative topolo- gies have been proposed. Experimental results show that Nogo A can have at least two different membrane topologies, pointing to the possibility of multiple func- tions at the membrane and within the cytoplasm. Using differing gene deletion methods, three groups generated Nogo-A − / − mice and reported varying levels of regeneration and recovery (Zheng et al. , 2003; Kim et al. , 2003; Simonen et al. , 2003). Strittmatter and col- leagues (Kim et al. , 2003) observed substantial regenera- tion and functional recovery in about half of young mice lacking Nogo A/B. In contrast, Tessier-Lavigne’s group Promoting the Regeneration of Axons within the Central Nervous System 437 FIGURE 26.3 Axonal regeneration after SCI in animals lacking Nogo-A/B or treated with NgR antagonist peptide.

B: Rats were treated with the NEP1-40 antagonist peptide intrathecally after mid-thoracic spinal cord hemisection and the CST was traced (GrandPre et al. , 2002).

Sections from the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site demonstrate regenerating fibers despite normal level of reac- tive astrocytosis. Untreated animals exhibit similar astrocytosis but no CST or 5HT regeneration. (See also Color Plate section.)

Finally, Schwab’s group noted axonal regeneration but no functional recovery in mice lacking Nogo-A selectively (Simonen et al. , 2003). Both the Tessier-Lavigne’s and Strittmatter’s groups note CNS myelin is less inhibitory without Nogo-A. These studies confirm some contribution of Nogo-A to limiting axon regeneration. However, they also demonstrate that other factors such as including genetic background, age, and mutation penetrance may play a role (Figure 26.3; see also the Color Plate section). Myelin-associated Glycoprotein Another myelin component that has potent in vitro inhibitory activity is myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) (McKerracher et al. , 1994; Mukhopadhyay et al. , 1994). Identified by chromatographic separation of myelin proteins, MAG contains five IgG domains and an intracellular domain. MAG acts as a bifunc- tional molecule (Mukhopadhyay et al. , 1994) during development. Before postnatal day 4, MAG promotes outgrowth during development, but the protein inhibits axonal growth in older neurons. Unlike Nogo, immunohistochemistry reveals that MAG is in both the CNS (in the periaxonal membrane and regions of uncompacted myelin) and the PNS (on outermost myelin loops). MAG − / − mice do not exhibit improved CNS regener- ation after spinal cord injury, suggesting that MAG plays a more minor role in deterring CNS regeneration post- injury (Bartsch et al. , 1995). However, MAG − / − mice show delayed myelination, myelin splitting, myelin redundancy, and decreased thickness of the periaxonal cytoplasmic collar of oligodendrocytes, indicating that MAG’s physiological function may be more relevant in maintaining myelin integrity (Johnson et al. , 1989). Oligodendrocyte-myelin Glycoprotein He and colleagues identified oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMgp) when they screened phosphoinosi- tol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) released proteins for the ability to inhibit neurite outgrowth (Wang et al. , 2002b). OMgp was also determined to be responsible for the inhibitory activity of a previously described myelin fraction termed arretin. Structural analysis reveals that OMgp is heavily glycosylated protein, composed of a cysteine-rich amino terminus, five leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, and a carboxy-terminal domain with serine/threonine repeats followed by a glycophos- phatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor. Like Nogo, OMgp is expressed in both oligodendrocytes and neurons. Heretofore, an OMgp null phenotype has been described. Nogo Receptor The Nogo receptor (NgR) was identified in an expres- sion cloning strategy using AP-Nogo-66 binding (Fournier et al. , 2001). In vitro, NgR is required for Nogo- 66 inhibition of axonal growth. NgR was later found to bind MAG and OMgp with high affinity and to mediate their inhibitory functions (Liu et al. , 2002; Domeniconi et al. , 2002). Immunostaining reveals NgR to be expressed in nearly all neurons and in high levels in CNS white matter in profiles consistent with axons. Structurally NgR con- tains a signal sequence followed by eight leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, a carboxy-terminus cysteine-rich domain, and a GPI anchor, localizing NgR to lipid rafts. Because GPI-linked proteins do not span the membrane, a co-receptor is required for NgR signal transduction, in a manner reminiscent of glial cell line–derived neu- rotrophic factor (GDNF) receptor (Tansey et al. , 2000). One candidate co-receptor is p75-NTR, the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor (Wang et al. , 2002a). Despite in vitro data supporting this role, in situ studies reveal that p75-NTR expression patterns in the adult do not match well to patterns of neuronal responsiveness to myelin inhibition. p75-NTR may or may not be the only NgR co-receptor. As part of an effort to understand how NgR inter- acts with three structurally unrelated ligands, two groups solved NgR’s crescent shaped crystal structure (He et al. , 2003; Barton et al. , 2003). Understanding the molecular basis behind NgR binding to its cis - and trans -partners would allow for selective and poten- tially therapeutic disruption of this ligand-receptor complex. Signaling downstream of the NgR is discussed in the section that characterizes intrinsic inhibitory factors. The phenotype of the NgR − / − mouse is under study in our laboratory. Clinical Applications Chondroitinase ABC Fawcett, McMahon, and colleagues intrathecally administered chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) to digest CSPGs (Bradbury et al. , 2002). CSPG digestion allows crushed adult rat dorsal columns to sprout and grow both ascending sensory projections and descending CST axons after injury. Increased sprouting promotes functional recovery of locomotor and proprioceptive behaviors. Because chondroitin sulfate is the major biochemical inhibitor of the glial scar, a principal regeneration impediment, novel SCI therapies may incorporate CSPG neutralization strategies (Moon et al. , 2001). 438 Promoting the Regeneration of Axons within the Central Nervous System Ch26.qxd 9/1/04 6:53 AM Page 438"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"Anti-Nogo-A Antibody Of the three Nogo isoforms, Nogo-A has been the principal target in in vivo studies. Schwab and col- leagues implanted hybridoma cells that produce a mon- oclonal antibody against Nogo-A, IN-1, into the cortex of young rats and reported that the treatment improves long-distance sprouting and regeneration after corti- cospinal and optic nerve injuries (Merkler et al. , 2001). Functionally, chronic exposure to IN-1 improves both sensorimotor reflex and locomotor function (Bregman et al. , 1995). Reassuringly, neurogenic pain caused by inappropriate fiber growth was not detected in a tail flick assay (Merkler et al. , 2001). These results indicate that rewiring of motor systems’ functional recovery without neurogenic pain is possible after Nogo-A neutralization. NEP 1-40 Because Nogo-66 induces inhibition via NgR, a Nogo-66 antagonist should reverse its action. Analysis of the minimal Nogo domain for binding to NgR reveals a short segment consisting of 40 residues that binds but does not stimulate the receptor (GrandPre et al. , 2002). NEP 1-40 peptide (NgR antagonist) sys- temically administered to spinal-injured rats promotes CST regeneration and ambulation (Li and Strittmatter, 2003). The ability of systemic NEP1-40 to induce regen- eration supports the notion that the blood-brain barrier is permissive after trauma. It is also noted that antago- nist treatment could be delayed for up to 1 week with- out limiting the benefit to motor function recovery. This may prove to be useful in the clinical setting where SCI therapy cannot begin until the patient is transported from the trauma scene and is medically stable. Because NEP1-40 blocks Nogo-66 but not MAG or OMgp, a more general NgR antagonist may be more effective in promoting recovery. Ecto-NgR Because NEP 1-40 is a selective Nogo-66 antagonist, Strittmatter and colleagues considered the soluble ectodomain of NgR (Ecto-NgR) as an universal blocker (Fournier et al. , 2002). This reagent stimulates a greater degree of axon growth over myelin in vitro than does NEP 1-40. In vivo studies suggest that this reagent increases axon regeneration to twice the extent of NEP 1- 40. However, Ecto-NgR is unable to overcome the inhibitory activity of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, suggesting that Ecto-NgR disruption is specific for myelin inhibition. This reagent is undergoing in vivo SCI testing in rodents. Myelin Vaccination Because other uncharacterized myelin inhibitory activi- ties may exist, McKerracher and colleagues have used a myelin vaccination approach to promote injured CST regeneration (Huang et al. , 1999). Mice immunized with CNS myelin show extensive CST fiber regeneration and hindlimb motor recovery, without immune response side effects such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). It is likely that a substantial axonal regeneration will require the simultaneous alleviation of multiple inhibitors. For clinical use, this approach of stimulating the immune system to block CNS inhibition will require refinement to ensure that no autoimmune disease results. As the authors note, identifying the blocking antibodies could lead to the development of passive immunization approaches to axon regeneration. In a related approach, Schwartz and colleagues obtain similar results by administration of myelin-primed immune cells. Surgical Transplantation: Olfactory Ensheathing Cells Because several factors (blocking myelin-associated inhibitors, controlling fibrosis, blocking inhibitory pro- teoglycans, preventing tissue necrosis and cavitation) need to be addressed to overcome extrinsic inhibition, one approach that obviates these issues is transplantation of exogenous cells to create a new regenerative environment (Davies et al. , 1997). The olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) have been tested in this regard because they nor- mally ensheathe axons that capable of regenerative growth in the CNS and can form myelin (Resnick et al. , 2003). Schwann cells or embryonic stem cells have also been used in various experiments. Using OECs, Avila and colleagues report an impressive motor function improvement 3 to 7 months after a complete spinal cord transaction in adult rats (Ramon-Cueto et al. , 2000). Several other indepen- dent groups also report improved function with trans- plantation of adult-derived cultured OECs. For further OEC discussion, refer to the chapter by J. Kocsis, Cell Transplantation and Repair of Injured White Matter. OVERCOMING INTRINSIC INHIBITORY FACTORS Extrinsic inhibitory signaling through NgR leads to Rho-A activation and consequent ROCK activation. Therefore, Rho-A and ROCK represent potential thera- peutic loci for intervention. Rho-A Activation Is Responsible for NgR Signaling Data from several laboratories confirm that Rho fam- ily of GTPases, specifically Rho-A is the downstream Promoting the Regeneration of Axons within the Central Nervous System 439 Ch26.qxd 9/1/04 6:53 AM Page 439"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"effector of myelin and NgR inhibitory signaling (Jin and Strittmatter, 1997; Lehmann et al. , 1999; Dergham et al. , 2002; Niederost et al. , 2002; Fournier et al. , 2003). As a member of the small GTPase Rho family, Rho-A is acti- vated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that enhance GTP binding or inhibited by GTPase acti- vating proteins (GAPs) that promote GTP hydrolysis (Hall, 1998). Most cases of receptor-mediated activation of monomeric G-proteins occur via GEF proteins. However, one hypothesis suggests that inhibitory extra- cellular cues such as myelin and Nogo promote Rho-A activation by inactivating Rho guanine dissociation inhibitor (GDI), a molecule that sequesters inactive Rho-GDP from GEFs (Yamashita et al. , 1999). Rock Inhibition Promotes Growth on Inhibitory Substrates Several studies suggest that Rho-A’s downstream effector in axonal growth inhibition by myelin is the ser- ine/threonine Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) (Fournier et al. , 2003). As a Rho-A effector, ROCK causes rapid growth cone collapse, neurite retraction, and neurite growth inhibition. In a stripe assay, incubation of retinal explants with Y27632, a specific pyridine derived inhibitor of ROCK, also reduces the CSPG’s inhibition (Monnier et al. , 2003). Because Rho and ROCK are con- vergent signaling points, the added benefit of blocking ROCK activity is that both CSPG and myelin-associated inhibition can be reduced. Clinical Applications C3 An enzyme from Clostridium botulinum , C3 trans- ferase, blocks Rho A, B, and C function by ADP ribosy- lation on asparagine 41, without affecting Rac or Cdc42. C3 treatment of SCI rodents has produced mixed results (Dergham et al. , 2002; Fournier et al. , 2003). In one study, a single local dose of C3 produces long-distance regeneration of anterogradely labeled CST axons and improvement in locomotion by open-field testing. In contrast, a second study reports that C3 treatment only increases scarring without functional improvement. The discrepancy may be explained by variable C3 accessibility to the neuronal cytoplasm. Y-27632 Administration of the ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, has produced regenerative CST fiber sprouting after spinal cord injury in two studies. Treated animals recover hindlimb use for locomotion to significant extent over control rodents. In comparing the effects of C3 and Y27632, McKerracher and colleagues conclude that C3 is more effective than Y27632. They speculate that unidentified Rho effectors uninhibited by Y27632, such as protein kinase N and rhotekin, may explain the difference (Winton et al. , 2002). PROMOTING INTRINSIC STIMULATORY FACTORS Because there are intrinsic differences between the PNS and CNS response to axonal injury, a number of studies have investigated changes in gene expression to identify intrinsic stimulatory factors. Two intrinsic stim- ulatory factors are RAGs and cAMP. Regeneration-Associated Genes A landmark study by Richardson, Aguayo, and col- leagues demonstrates that dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells are 100 times more likely to regenerate into peripheral nerve grafts if their peripheral axons were also cut (Richardson and Issa, 1984). In a follow-up study, Richardson and colleagues show that DRG cells could regenerate their central axons into PNS grafts only if the axon had been previously cut. Recently, Woolf and colleagues report that a conditioning peripheral lesion allows ascending dorsal column axons to extensively sprout into the spinal injury site (Neumann and Woolf, 1999). This set of observations suggests that a coordinated nerve regeneration pro- gram at the cell body exists and needs to be turned on with conditioning. At the molecular level, there is mounting evidence for a coordinated regeneration program. Like myelin- associated inhibitors, in recent years several program components have been identified, characterized, and dubbed as RAGs [GAP-43 (Caroni, 1997; Bomze et al. , 2001), CAP-23 (Frey et al. , 2000), SPRR1A (Bonilla et al. , 2002), and Fn14 (Tanabe et al. , 2003)]. Two charac- terized RAGs that will be discussed here are GAP-43 and SPRR1A. GAP-43 Regarded as the classic RAG, GAP-43 was identified as a rapidly transported axonal protein that is highly up- regulated after sciatic nerve injury. GAP-43 is localized to growth cones associated with neuropil areas. RAGs, such as GAP-43, are highly expressed during nervous system developmental and regenerative axon growth (Kalil and Skene, 1986). Constitutive GAP-43 overexpression in lesioned adult mouse neurons leads to enhanced sprouting and reinner- 440 Promoting the Regeneration of Axons within the Central Nervous System Ch26.qxd 9/1/04 6:53 AM Page 440"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"vation (Aigner et al. , 1995), whereas the GAP-43 − / − mouse exhibits high postnatal mortality and retinal gan- glion axonal pathfinding defects, without changes in nerve growth rate (Strittmatter et al. , 1995), suggesting that the presence of GAP-43 promotes outgrowth, but the absence does not exclude outgrowth. Transgenic overexpression of both CAP-23 and GAP-43 allows a limited degree of CNS sensory fiber regeneration (Bomze et al. , 2001). Methods for pharmacologically mimicking GAP-43 action may have potential as axon regenerative therapeutics (Strittmatter et al. , 1994). SPRR1A Identified by microarray analysis for up-regulated genes after mouse sciatic nerve injury, SPRR1A is a member of the small proline-rich family (Bonilla et al. , 2002). SPRR1A expression after axotomy is unexpected because SPRR1A, found in the cross-linked cornified epithelium, is a highly specific marker for the differentia- tion of keratinocytes and squamous epithelial cells. Structurally, SPRR1A is composed of a repeating pro- line-rich octapeptide sequence. In vitro, SPRR1A expressing neurons exhibit outgrowth comparable to conditioning axotomy supporting the idea that acute SPRR1A induction is a part of a peripheral nerve regen- eration program. Unlike GAP-43, SPRR1A is not detected in developing neurons, suggesting that there may be differences between gene expression during devel- opmental axonal extension and regenerative axonal growth. As for GAP-43, a SPRR1A-mimetic may be a potential therapeutic class to regenerate axons. Further understanding will come from how RAG signaling converges to promote outgrowth. cAMP Filbin and colleagues discovered that endogenous cAMP levels influence the responsiveness of dorsal root ganglion to myelin inhibition (Cai et al. , 2001; Cai et al. , 1999). In addition, inhibiting a downstream cAMP effec- tor, protein kinase A (PKA), prevents myelin and MAG inhibition of neurite outgrowth. Therefore, cAMP mod- ulation represents another control point for promote axonal extension (Song et al. , 1998). Protein Kinase A Two lines of evidence supporting cAMP’s role in modulating inhibition are that endogenous DRG cAMP levels decrease postnatally and dorsal root ganglion cAMP levels increase (Cai et al. , 2001). The first line of evidence is consistent with the notion that high levels of endogenous cAMP in young DRG neurons account for the neurite outgrowth promotion (Qiu et al. , 2002). The second line suggests that reconstitution of some regener- ation program may be mediated by cAMP. Investigation into downstream cAMP effects have led to two potential effectors, PKA and Arginase I (Cai et al. , 2002). Increased cAMP levels have the potential to directly alter the actin cytoskeleton by coupling momomeric G pro- teins (Bos, 2003). Second, transient cAMP increases with protein kinase A (PKA) activation and CREB have been implicated in gene regulation. A gene that has been shown to be up-regulated after cAMP elevation is Arginase I (Arg I). Arginase I and Polyamines cAMP elevation by direct injection into DRG over- comes MAG and myelin inhibition and results in a mod- erate degree of dorsal column axon regeneration for mice lesioned 1 week later. This process involves PKA, but eventually becomes PKA-independent, suggesting possi- ble transcriptional changes. One potential explanation for this change is that cAMP up-regulates Arginase I, a key enzyme involved in polyamine synthesis. Both Arginase I overexpression and exogenous polyamines addi- tion can overcome MAG and myelin inhibition, in vitro , whereas blocking Arginase I or ornithine decarboxy- lase (Odc) prevents elevated cAMP from overcoming inhibition (Cai et al. , 2002; Chu et al. , 1995). Clinical Application Until gene therapy becomes a safer reality, therapies that directly modulate RAG expression such as GAP-43 need to overcome many technical and regulatory obsta- cles. Therefore, murine models that overexpress intrinsic stimulatory factors with poor CNS accessibility are good starting points to identify relevant targets, but for clinical applications, agents that modulate accessible targets such as db-cAMP are more relevant. db-cAMP Modulation Several compounds that increase cAMP levels in vivo by blocking specific cAMP phosphodiesterase have been developed. Cell-permeable dibutyryl cAMP mimics cAMP itself, and promotes the regeneration of ascending sensory fibers across a spinal injury site when injected near the DRG cell body (Neumann et al. , 2002; Qiu et al. , 2002). Rolipram is a specific inhibitor of the brain-enriched type 4 cAMP phosphodiesterase. It was originally developed as an antidepressant, but it may provide a means to elevate cAMP in axotomized CNS neurons. Ongoing tests will explain their efficacy and specificity for promoting axon regeneration in vivo. Promoting the Regeneration of Axons within the Central Nervous System 441 Ch26.qxd 9/1/04 6:53 AM Page 441"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS OF AXONAL REGENERATION If one or more of the above approaches leads to clin- ical axon regeneration, then there must be concern for potential side effects. A primary concern has to relate to the aberrant and deleterious connections. Such connec- tions could potentially lead to neuropathic pain and/or epilepsy. To date, such side effects have not been detected in any of the rodent spinal injury studies despite the increase in axon regrowth. For various novel methods, continued vigilance for such side effects is warranted. Other potential side effects relate to alterations in biol- ogy other than axon growth. A priori , upstream disrup- tors such as IN-1, NEP 1-40, Ecto-NgR, and ChABC appear least likely to cause unintended side effects. Downstream inactivation of the Rho signaling pathway, alterations in RAGs or modulation of cAMP seem more prone to alter the function of other cellular events and other cell types. A full evaluation of their side effects is necessary. CONCLUSION More than two decades have passed since Aguayo and colleagues performed their classic transplantation studies, and since then the spinal cord regeneration field has produced promising targets for drug discovery. Early successes in promoting axon regeneration by Nogo/NgR blockade, CSPG digestion, ROCK inhibi- tion, cAMP regulation, and cell transplantation are encouraging. It is quite likely that optimal future approaches will involve combinatorial treatments that remove endogenous regeneration roadblocks and encourage the regenerative capacity of injured and non- injured axons. It is reasonable to hope that, in the not too distant future, neurologists and neurosurgeons will be able to offer their patients with SCI new restorative treatments.

AD affects more than 4 million people in the United States. Because of increased life expectancy and the post- war baby boom, the elderly are the fastest growing seg- ment of our society, and during the next 25 years, the number of people with AD in the United States will triple, as will the cost (Mayeux 2003; Petersen 2000; Brookmeyer et al. , 1998). Because of its high prevalence, cost, lack of mechanism-based treatments, and impact on individuals and caregivers, AD is one of the most challenging diseases in medicine and development of new effective therapies will have a significant impact on the health and care of the elderly (Brookmeyer et al. , 1998; Mayeux, 2003; Selkoe, 2001; Price et al. , 1998b; Wong, et al. , 2002). The classical clinical phenotype of AD, a late life progressive disorder of memory and cognition, is quite distinct and results from pathology associated with dys- function and death of specific populations of neurons, particularly those systems involved in the functions impaired in AD (Price et al. , 1998b). Characteristic intra- cellular and extracellular protein aggregates (tau and A β - related abnormalities, respectively), implicated in pathogenic processes, are critical elements of this pathol- ogy (Wong et al. , 2002; Hardy et al. , 2002; Lee et al. , 2001; Selkoe 2001). Genetic evidence indicates that inher- itance of mutations in several genes causes autosomal dominant familial AD (FAD), while the presence of certain alleles of other genes, particularly ApoE, are sig- nificant risk factors for putative sporadic disease (Mayeux 2003; Tanzi et al. , 2001; Price et al. , 1998b). This information has been used to create models of dis- ease (i.e., mice expressing mutant transgenes). In parallel, targeting of genes encoding proteins thought to be impli- cated in disease pathways has provided new understand- ing of the roles of specific gene products in AD and the potential of these proteins as therapeutic targets. The value of these targets for new treatment strategies is being tested in model systems and, once safety and effi- cacy are assured, in human trials. To illustrate some of these concepts, we first describe the clinical, pathological, biochemical, and genetic fea- tures of the human illness. Subsequently, we discuss selected aspects: the biology of proteins implicated in pathogenesis of disease; the value of genetically engi- neered models; the identification of new therapeutic targets; and experimental treatments in models. CLINICAL FEATURES AD is the most common cause of dementia occurring in the elderly (Mayeux 2003; Selkoe 2001; Price et al. , 1998b; Wong et al. , 2002), a term that refers to a syn- drome associated with memory loss and cognitive impairments of sufficient severity to interfere with social, occupational, and personal functions (Petersen 2000; Petersen et al. , 2001a; Morris et al. , 2001b; Petersen 2003). AD often initially manifests as a syndrome termed mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is usually characterized by: a memory complaint (corroborated 445 CHAPTER 27 Alzheimer’s Disease: Clinical Features, Neuropathological and Biochemical Abnormalities, Genetics, Models, and Experimental Therapeutics Donald L. Price, MD David R. Borchelt, PhD Philip C. Wong, PhD Ch27.qxd 9/2/04 10:18 AM Page 445"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"by informant); memory impairments on formal testing; intact general cognition; preserved activities of daily events; and absence of overt dementia (Petersen, 2003). MCI, particularly of the amnesic variety, is regarded as a transitional stage between normal aging and early AD (Petersen 2003; Petersen et al. , 1999; Petersen et al. , 2001a; Morris et al. , 2001b; Petersen et al. , 2001b; Petersen 2003). The clinical manifestations of AD include difficulties in memory and in domains of other cognitive functions (executive functions, language, atten- tion, judgment, etc.) (Petersen et al. , 2000; Albert et al. , 2001; Petersen et al. , 2001a; Daly et al. , 2000; Price et al. , 1999; Morris et al. , 2001b; Morris et al. , 2001a; Killiany et al. , 2000; Killiany et al. , 2002; Petersen et al. , 1999; Petersen et al. , 2001b; Petersen, 2000). Psychotic symptoms develop in some patients, such as depression/ hallucinations and delusions (Cummings, 2003; Lyketsos et al. , 2002). Over time, mental functions and activities of daily living are increasingly impaired, and in the late stages, these individuals become profoundly demented and bedridden and usually die of intercurrent illness. To make a diagnosis of AD, clinicians rely on histories from patients and informants, physical, neurological, and psychiatric examinations, neuropsychological testing (Daly et al. , 2000; Albert et al. , 2001), laboratory stud- ies (Sunderland et al. , 2003), and a variety of other approaches, including neuroimaging studies (see subse- quent discussion). In the cerebrospinal fluid cases of AD, the levels of A β peptide are often low, and levels of tau may be higher than those in controls (Sunderland et al. , 2003). Values vary between individuals and single measures may not be great diagnostic value. However, future research should disclose whether serial measures of CSF markers may have diagnostic utility (Petersen 2000). Over several examinations, the clinical profile, in concert with these lab- oratory assessments, allows the clinician to make a diagno- sis of possible or probable AD (McKhann et al. , 1984). Imaging approaches promise to be increasingly valu- able for aid in diagnosis and for assessing outcomes of new therapies. In cases of AD, magnetic resonance imag- ing (MRI) often discloses regional brain atrophy, partic- ularly involving hippocampus (Jack et al. , 2000) and entorhinal cortex) (Killiany et al. , 2002; Petersen et al. , 2000). Rates of hippocampal atrophy appear to correlate with changes in clinical status (Jack et al. , 2000) and may have predictive value for diagnosis of AD (Killiany et al. , 2000). In AD, positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) commonly demonstrate decreased regional blood flow in the parietal and temporal lobes with involvement of other cortical areas at later stages (Klunk et al. , 2001; Jack, et al. , 2000). Recently, a Pittsburgh- Swedish consortium has used Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB), a brain penetrant 18 F-labeled uncharged thioflavin derivative, which binds to A β with high affinity, to visu- alize, via PET, the A β burden in the brains of affected individuals (Klunk et al. , 2001; Klunk et al. , 2003; Klunk et al. , 2004). In comparison with controls, subjects with AD show marked retention of PIB in areas of brain known to accumulate amyloid (Klunk et al. , 2004). This approach (and others under development) should even- tually prove useful for enhancing accuracy of diagnosis of early AD and for assessing the efficacies of anti-amy- loid therapeutics in both animal models and human patients. Although AD is a disorder for which only symp- tomatic treatments are available (Petersen, 2003), we are on the threshold of new mechanism-based therapies, and, in the future, our ability to make early and accurate diagnoses of AD will become increasingly important for identifying the clinical populations most likely to respond to specific treatments. NEUROPATHOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY Brain Regions/Neural Systems The clinical signs of AD reflect that pathology associ- ated with the selective dysfunction and death of popula- tions of neurons in brain regions/systems critical for memory, learning, and cognitive performance. These circuits include the basal forebrain cholinergic system, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, limbic cortex, and neo- cortex (Whitehouse et al. , 1981; Beach et al. , 2000; Morris et al. , 2001b; Price et al. , 1999; Hyman et al. , 1984; Braak et al. , 1996; Gomez-Isla et al. , 1996; Braak et al. , 1991). Degeneration of neurons in these regions/circuits are reflected by the presence of cytoskele- tal abnormalities in these cells as manifested by neu- rofibrillary pathology and dystrophic neurites (Lee et al. , 2001); the presence of neuritic A β -containing plaques (sites of synaptic disconnection) in brain regions receiv- ing inputs from these nerve cells (Selkoe 2001; Sisodia et al. , 2002; Price et al. , 1999); reductions in both generic and transmitter specific synaptic markers of these trans- mitter systems in the target fields of these neurons (Beach et al. , 2000; Sze et al. , 1997; Price et al. , 1998a; Masliah et al. , 1994; Terry et al. , 1991); loss of neurons in these regions (Mattson 2001; Whitehouse et al. , 1981; Roth 2001); and local glial/inflammatory reactions (par- ticularly associated with plaques) (Akiyama et al. , 2000). Disruption of synaptic communication in these circuits, associated eventually with degeneration of neurons, has profound clinical consequences. Abnormalities that dam- age the circuits involving the entorhinal cortex, hip- pocampus, and medial temporal cortex are presumed to make critical contributions to memory impairments. Pathology in the neocortex is reflected by deficits in 446 Alzheimer’s Disease Ch27.qxd 9/2/04 10:18 AM Page 446"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"higher cognitive functions, such as disturbances in language, calculation, problem solving, and judgment. Alterations in the basal forebrain cholinergic system may contribute to memory difficulties and attention deficits, while the behavioral and emotional disturbances may reflect involvement of the limbic cortex, amygdala, thalamus, and monoaminergic systems. Amyloid and Plaques A β , a 4-kD peptide, is derived by cleavages of the amy- loid precursor protein (APP) (Selkoe 2001; Hardy et al. , 2002; Sisodia et al. , 2002; Price et al. , 1998b) to generate A β 1-40, 42 and 11-40, 42 amyloid peptides (Cai et al. , 2001). These extracellular peptides accumulate in the neu- ropil of the neocortex and hippocampus in cases of AD (Price et al. , 1998b; Wong et al. , 2002; Hardy et al. , 2002; Sisodia et al. , 2002; Selkoe 2001). In neurons, APP is rap- idly transported in axons (Buxbaum et al. , 1998; Koo et al. , 1990; Sisodia et al. , 1993), and A β appears to be principally produced at terminals by several cleavage activities (see subsequent section) (Wong et al. , 2001; Wolfe 2002; Sisodia et al. , 2002). A β is secreted as monomers, but oligomers and multimers, particularly involving A β 42 (Iwatsubo et al. , 1994) appear to be the toxic moiety (Klein et al. , 2001; Selkoe 2002; Walsh et al. , 2002). These peptides adopt β -pleated sheet conforma- tions and assemble into protofilaments and fibrils (Caughey et al. , 2003); peptide aggregates are birefringent when stained with Congo Red (or thioflavine) and viewed in polarized light (or fluorescence). Neurites are swollen axons/terminals containing filamentous and membranous organelles; they occur in proximity to amyloid deposits (Price et al. , 1998b; Sisodia, et al. , 2002). Synaptic termi- nals are thought to be a major source of APP that gives rise to A β (Wong et al. , 2001); Thus, synapses release A β and are, in turn, damaged by elevated levels of A β pep- tides; presynaptic terminals become disconnected from targets and form the neurites in plaques. APP, a single pass transmembrane protein, is encoded by a gene localized to the mid-portion of the long arm of human chromosome 21 (Price et al. , 1999; Price et al. , 1998b; Sisodia et al. , 2002). Enriched in neurons, APP is transported anterograde in axons to terminals (Buxbaum et al. , 1998; Koo et al. , 1990; Sisodia et al. , 1993). It is hypothesized that the proteins responsible for β - and γ -secretase activities are also present at terminals in CNS circuits. This concept is supported by immunocytochem- ical studies interpreted to show colocalization of APP with several secretase proteins in neurites (Sheng et al. , 2003). At these sites, β -secretase (see below) cleaves APP to form amyloidogenic C-terminal derivatives (Buxbaum et al. , 1998), which are then further cleaved by γ -secretase to generate A β 40, 42, 43 peptides. Released at terminals, A β may serve as a synaptic modulator depressing activ- ity at excitatory, glutaminergic synapses via the NMDA receptor (Kamenetz et al. , 2003). It has been suggested that accumulation of A β oligomers and multimers (Walsh et al. , 2002; Selkoe 2002; Klein et al. , 2001; Gong et al. , 2003), released in proximity to synapses, act as toxic disrupting synaptic functions, including long-term potentiation (LTP) (Walsh et al. , 2002; Hsia et al. , 1999). Eventually, these terminals degenerate. As described pre- viously, the disconnected terminals form neurites around A β fibrillar deposits. Thus, neuritic amyloid plaques, a classical feature of AD, are complex structures, repre- senting sites of synaptic disconnection. Surrounding plaques are astrocytes and microglia which produce cytokines, chemokines, and other factors (including complement components) involved in inflammatory processes (Akiyama et al., 2000). Neurofibrillary Pathology Neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are fibrillar intracyto- plasmic inclusions (in cell bodies/proximal dendrites of affected neurons), while neuropil threads and neurites are swollen filament-containing dendrites and distal axons/terminals, respectively. The principal intracellular component of these lesions are paired helical filaments (PHF) comprised of poorly soluble hyperphosphory- lated isoforms of tau, a low-molecular-weight micro- tubule-associated protein (Lee et al., 2001; Goedert et al., 1992). In mature human brains, the six isoforms of tau are derived by alternative splicing from a single gene on chromosome 17 (Lee et al., 2001; Edbauer et al., 2002; Goedert et al., 1992). The six tau isoforms consist of three isoforms of three repeat tau (3-R tau), and three isoforms of four repeat (4-R) tau, the latter derived by inclusion of exon 10 in the transcript (Lee et al., 2001). Normally, tau is synthesized in neuronal cell bodies and transported anterograde in axons (Mercken et al., 1995), where it acts, via repeat regions that interact with tubu- lin, to stabilize tubulin polymers critical for microtubule assembly and stability (Lee et al., 2001; Edbauer et al., 2002). The post-translationally modified tau underlying the cellular pathology in some neurodegenerative disor- ders differs somewhat in the different tauopathies: in cases of AD, the PHF are comprised of six isoforms of tau; the inclusions occurring in cases of progressive supranuclear palsy and cortical basal degeneration (PSP and CBD) are characterized by 4-R tau; and the inclu- sions seen in individuals with Pick disease are enriched in 3-R tau (Lee et al., 2001). All of the AD-linked fibrillar inclusions (NFT, neu- rites and threads) appear to result from common mecha- nisms (Lee et al., 2001). However, in spite of considerable clinical, pathological research and experimental work, Alzheimer’s Disease 447 Ch27.qxd 9/2/04 10:18 AM Page 447"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"the links between tau pathology and A β are not fully defined (Busciglio et al., 1995; Mattson, 2001; Lee et al., 2001; Delacourte et al., 1998; Giasson et al., 2003; Hardy et al., 2002). Because the cytoskeleton is essential for maintaining cell geometry and for the intracellular traf- ficking and transport of proteins and organelles, it is likely that disturbances of the cytoskeleton are associ- ated with alterations in axonal transport, which in turn could compromise the functions and viability of neurons. Eventually, affected nerve cells die (possibly by apop- tosis) (Gastard et al., 2003; Whitehouse et al., 1981; Mattson, 2001; Troncoso et al., 1996; Roth, 2001), and extracellular neurofibrillary tangles are left behind as “tombstones” of the nerve cells destroyed by disease. GENETICS Genetic risk factors for AD (Tanzi et al., 2001; Mayeux, 2003; Sisodia et al., 2002; Price et al., 1998b) include mutations in the presenilin 1 ( PS1 ) (chromosome 14); mutations in the presenilin 2 ( PS2 ) (chromosome 1); and mutations in the APP (chromosome 21); and differ- ent alleles of ApoE, which is positioned on the proximal long arm of chromosome 19. The presence of autosomal dominant mutations in APP , PS1 , or PS2 tends to cause disease earlier than occurs in sporadic cases. Individuals with trisomy 21 (Down’s syndrome) have an extra copy of APP and AD pathology develops early in life. A poE E4 predisposes to later onset AD and some cases of late- onset familial AD (Strittmatter et al., 1993; Corder et al., 1994). Recent research has identified other loci that con- fer risk (Tanzi et al., 2001; Mayeux, 2003; Ertekin-Taner et al., 2000; Myers et al., 2000; Bertram et al., 2000). APP, a type I transmembrane protein existing as sev- eral isoforms, is abundant in the nervous system, but spe- cific functions of APP remain to be defined. Expressed in many different cell types, APP is particularly abundant in neurons. The protein is cleaved by activities of BACE1 ( b -site A PP c leaving e nzyme 1 ) and the γ -secretase com- plex (see subsequent section), which generate the N- and C-termini of A β peptides, respectively (Vassar et al., 2000; Sisodia et al., 2002; Vassar et al., 1999; Cai et al., 2001; Vassar et al., 2000; Sisodia et al., 2002). The majority of mutations in APP , PS1 , and PS influence these cleavages to increase the levels of all A β species or the relative amounts of toxic A β 42 (Tanzi et al., 2001; Sisodia et al., 2002; Sisodia et al., 2002). For example, the APPswe mutation, a double mutation involving codons 670 and 671, enhances many fold BACE1 cleavage at the N-terminus of A β ; the result is substantial elevation in levels of all A β 1-40, 42 peptides. In several families, the normally occurring valine residue at position 717 (of APP-770) is replaced with Ile, Gly, or Phe; these mutations promote γ -secretase activities and lead to increased secretion of Aa1- and 11-42,43. In a hereditary disease associated with A β deposition around blood ves- sels and cerebral hemorrhages, an APP mutation at posi- tion 693 leads to a Glu-Gln substitution (corresponding to amino acid 22 of A β ), which, in turn, is associated with formation of A β peptide species that are more prone to aggregate into fibrils. Thus, some of the muta- tions linked to FAD can change the processing of APP and influence the biology of A β by increasing the pro- duction of A β peptides or the amounts of the longer, more toxic A β 42, while other mutations may promote fibril formation. PS1 and PS2 encode two highly homologous, and conserved 43- to 50-kD multipass transmembrane pro- teins (Doan et al., 1996; Sherrington et al., 1995; Sisodia et al., 2002; Price et al., 1998b) that are involved in Notch 1 signaling pathways critical for cell fate deci- sions (Kopan et al., 2002; Sisodia et al., 2002). PS1 and PS2 are endoproteolytically cleaved to an N-terminal ∼ 28-kDa fragment and a C-terminal ∼ 18-kDa fragment (Thinakaran et al., 1997; Doan et al., 1996), both of which are critical components of the γ -secretase complex (Takasugi et al., 2003; Sisodia et al., 2002, Wolfe, 2002). Other components of the γ -secretase complex include: Nicastrin (Nct), a type I transmembrane glycoprotein (Sisodia et al., 2002; Kopan et al., 2002; De Strooper, 2003; Edbauer et al., 2002; Li et al., 2003; Kopan et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2000); and Aph1 and Pen2, two multipass transmembrane proteins (Francis et al., 2002; Steiner et al., 2002; Goutte et al., 2002). Significantly, γ -secretase cleaves both Notch-1 and APP ( Σ site), generating intracellular peptides termed N otch1 i ntra c ellular d omain (NICD) and A PP I ntra- c ellular d omain (AICD) (Kopan et al., 2002; Cao et al., 2001). These intracellular peptides traffic to the nucleus where they are involved in activation of transcription (Cao et al., 2001). For example, AICD interacts with FE65, a cytosolic adapter, and moves into the nucleus where it influences transcription (Cao et al., 2001). Studies of targeting of PS1 and Nct in mice (Wong et al., 1997; Shen et al., 1997; Liet al., 2003; Kopan et al., 2002) are consistent with the concept that PS1 and Nct are, along with Aph1 and Pen2 (Takasugi et al. , 2003; De Strooper, 2003; Capell et al., 2000), critical components of the γ -secretase complex. As discussed subsequently, the phenotypes of targeted PS1 and Nct are the result of failed Notch1 signaling. Nearly 50% of cases of early-onset familial AD are linked to the PS1 gene (chromosome 14), which has been reported to harbor >85 different FAD mutations (Tanzi et al., 2001; Sisodia et al., 2002; Sherrington et al., 1995; Sisodia et al., 2002; Tanzi et al., 2001; Price et al., 1998b). A small number of mutations in the PS2 448 Alzheimer’s Disease Ch27.qxd 9/2/04 10:18 AM Page 448"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"gene cause autosomal dominant AD in several FAD pedigrees (Price et al., 1998b; Tanzi et al., 2001). The majority of abnormalities in PS genes are missense mutations that result in single amino acid substitutions, which enhance γ -secretase activities and increase the levels of the A β 42 peptides. ApoE, a glycoprotein that carries cholesterol and other lipids in the blood, has been implicated as a risk factor for the disease (Mayeux, 2003; Corder et al., 1994; Strittmatter et al., 1993; Tanzi et al., 2001). At the single ApoE locus there are three alleles: ApoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 (Holtzman, 2001; Corder et al., 1994). The apoE3 allele is most common in the general population (fre- quency of 0.78), whereas the allelic frequency of apoE4 is 0.14. However, in clinic-based studies, patients with late-onset disease (>65 years of age) have an apoE4 allelic frequency of 0.50; thus, the risk for AD is increased by the presence of apoE4 (Corder et al., 1994; Strittmatter et al., 1993). The mechanisms whereby the apoE allele type elevates the risk for late-onset disease are not known. ApoE has no effect on A β synthesis, and it appears that ApoE and other proteins may influence extracellular A β metabolism in the CNS (DeMattos et al., 2002b; Holtzman, 2001). Significant differences exist in the abilities of ApoE isoforms to bind A β and these features of the individual protein are hypothesized to differentially influence aggregation, deposition and/or clearance of A β by ApoE. Although the presence of the ApoE-4 allele confers risk in late-onset disease (Tanzi et al., 2001), ApoE geno- typing, a useful research tool, does not appear helpful for routine diagnostic purposes. APP PROCESSING BY SECRETASES As indicated previously, APP is processed by secretase enzymes resulting in release of the ectodomain of APP, the production of AICD, and the generation of several A β peptide fragments. These enzyme activities and the secretase protein responsible for the cleavages are discussed subsequently. β -Secretase Activity BACE1 and BACE2, encoded by genes on chromo- somes 11 and 21, respectively, are transmembrane aspartyl proteases that are directly involved in the cleav- ages of APP (Vassar, 2001; Vassar et al., 1999; Cai et al., 2001; Luo et al., 2001; Sinha et al., 1999; Yan et al., 1999; Bennett et al., 2000; Farzan et al., 2000; Haniu, 2000). BACE1 mRNA levels are quite high in many regions of brain, and BACE1 protein is present in the CNS. In con- trast, levels of BACE1 in PNS appear to be low. Moreover, although BACE1 mRNA is present in a variety of tissues, levels of this protein are low in most non-neural tissues. Significantly, in the pancreas, BACE1mRNA is high but the transcript is alternatively spliced to produce a smaller protein incapable of cleaving APP (Bodendorf et al., 2001). BACE2 mRNA, present in a variety of systemic organs, is very low in neural tissues, except for scattered nuclei in the hypothalamus and brainstem (Bennett et al., 2000). Moreover, BACE2 activity appears to be virtually undetected in brain regions involved in AD. BACE1, an aspartyl protease (Hong et al., 2000; Vassar et al., 1999; Vassar, 2001) preferentially cleaves APP at the + 11 > + 1 sites of A β in APP (Cai et al., 2001), and this enzyme is essential for the generation of A β (Cai et al., 2001). Significantly, APPswe is cleaved perhaps 100-fold more efficiently at the + 1 site than is wildtype APP. Thus, the presence of this mutation greatly increases BACE1 cleavage and accounts for the elevation of A β species in the presence of this mutation. Analyses of cells and brains from BACE1 -deficient mice, which show no overt developmental phenotype (Cai et al., 2001; Luo et al., 2001; Luo et al., 2003), disclosed that A β 1- 40/42 and A β 11-40/42 is not secreted in these samples (Cai et al., 2001; Luo et al., 2001). Thus, BACE1 is the principal neuronal β -secretase and is responsible for the critical penultimate proamyloidogenic cleavages. In con- trast, BACE2 is responsible, along with α -secretase (Sisodia et al., 1990), for anti-amyloidogenic cleavages at + 19/ + 20 of A β (Farzan et al., 2000; Haniu, 2000). Thus, BACE2 acts like α -secretase (Sisodia et al., 2002; Sisodia et al., 1990). In the CNS, BACE1, along with APP and, presumably, components of γ -secretase complex, is pres- ent at some, if not all, synapses. These observations are consistent with the idea that A β , derived from neuronal APP and released in synaptic terminals, may influence synaptic activity (Kamenetz et al., 2003). γ -Secretase These enzyme activities, essential for the regulated intramembraneous proteolysis of a variety of transmem- brane proteins, depend on a multiprotein catalytic complex, which includes PS and several other transmem- brane proteins (Sisodia et al., 2002; Takasugi et al., 2003; Selkoe et al., 2003; Li et al., 2003). PS1 may act as an aspartyl protease itself; function as a co-factor critical for the activity of γ -secretase; or play a role in trafficking of APP or proteins critical for enzyme activity to the proper compartment for γ -secretase cleavage (Wolfe et al., 1999; Naruse et al., 1998; Esler et al., 2000; De Strooper et al., 1998; Wolfe, 2002). These concepts are supported by sev- eral observations: PS1 is isolated with γ -secretase under specific detergent-soluble conditions (Li et al., 2000a); Alzheimer’s Disease 449 Ch27.qxd 9/2/04 10:18 AM Page 449"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"PS1 is selectively cross-linked or photoaffinity-labeled by transition state inhibitors (Li et al., 2000b; Esler et al., 2000); substitutions of aspartate residues at D257 in TM6 and at D385 in TM7 have been reported to reduce secretion of A β and cleavage of Notch1 in vitro (Wolfe et al., 1999); cells in which PS1 has been targeted show decreased levels of secretion of A β (De Strooper, 2003; Takasugi et al., 2003; Li et al., 2003; Naruse et al., 1998). Several other proteins, including Nct, Aph1, and Pen2, also play roles in the multiprotein catalytic complex (Yu et al., 2000; Francis et al., 2002; Li et al., 2003; Takasugi et al., 2003; Edbauer et al., 2002; Li et al., 2003). As described below, studies of Nct null mice and NCT − / − fibroblasts have shown that NCT is an integral member of the γ -secretase complex (Li et al., 2003), and partial decreases in the level of NCT significantly reduce the secretion of A β (Li et al., 2003). Aph-1 and Pen-2 (De Strooper, 2003; Takasugi et al., 2003; Francis et al., 2002; Goutte et al., 2002) are novel transmembrane proteins: Aph1 has seven predicted transmembrane domains; while Pen2 has two predicted transmembrane regions (De Strooper, 2003; Takasugi et al., 2003). These proteins interact with sel-12/PS and aph2/nicastrin and their inactivation decreases γ -secretase cleavages of APP and Notch1 and reduces levels of processed PS. For these rea- sons, Aph1 and Pen2 are now recognized to be critical components of γ -secretase complex. MODELS OF A Β AMYLOIDOSIS IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM For a number of autosomal dominant neurological diseases, transgenic approaches have been used to model features of neurodegenerative diseases in mice and other species (Zoghbi et al., 2002; Shulman et al., 2003; Bonini et al., 2003; Duff et al., 2001; Wong et al., 2002). In mice, expression of APPswe or APP717 minigenes (with or without mutant PS1 ) leads to an A β amyloidosis in the CNS (Mucke et al., 2000; Borchelt et al., 2002; Whittemore, 1999; Calhoun et al., 1998; Duff et al., 2001; Holtzman et al., 2000; Hsia et al., 1999; Bacskai et al., 2001; Bacskai et al., 2003; Borchelt et al., 1997; Borchelt et al., 1996). The nature and levels of the expressed trans- gene and the specific mutation influence the severity of the pathology. Mice expressing both mutant PS1 and mutant APP develop accelerated disease. In these ani- mals, levels of A β in brain are elevated, and diffuse A β deposits and neuritic plaques appear in the hippocampus and cortex. For example, in transgenic mice generated at Hopkins (Borchelt et al., 1996; Borchelt et al., 1997; Lesuisse et al., 2001), the pathology evolves in stages: lev- els of A β in brain increase with age; synaptic markers are altered as diffuse A β deposits appear (although there is some disagreement as to the sequence); neurites become apparent in proximity to deposits; and neuritic plaques are associated glial responses. In our mice, aggregated tau and neurofibrillary tangles are not present (Xu et al., 2002). In some lines, the density of synaptic terminals is reduced and these abnormalities appear linked to a defi- ciency in synaptic transmission (Hsia et al., 1999; Chapman et al., 1999). Some lines of mice show degen- eration of neurons (Calhoun et al., 1998) and reductions in transmitter markers (Boncristiano et al., 2002). Learning deficits, problems in object recognition memory, and difficulties performing tasks assessing spa- tial reference and working memory have been identified in some of the lines of mutant mice with high levels of mutant transgene expression (Savonenko et al., 2003a; Savonenko et al., 2003b; Chapman et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2000). Behavioral deficits show some correlation with physiological properties identified in hippocampal cir- cuits (Chapman et al., 1999). Although the mutant mice do not fully recapitulate the complete phenotype of AD, these animals are very useful subjects for research designed to examine disease mechanisms and to test novel therapies designed to ameliorate the amyloid in related pathology and behavioral abnormalities. The paucity of tau abnormalities in these various lines of mutant transgenic mice may be explained by differ- ences between species. Mice express three copies of the murine variant of 4-R tau while humans express three copies of both 3-R tau and 4-R tau. Early efforts to express mutant tau transgenes in mice did not lead to striking clinical phenotypes or pathology (Duff et al., 2000). Subsequent studies produced tau -overexpressing mice with clinical signs. For example, overexpression of tau in some lines of mice led to weakness thought to reflect on degeneration of motor axons and evidence of accumulation of hypophosphorylated tau in neurons of the spinal cord, brainstem, and cortex (Lee et al., 2001). When the prion or Thy1 promoters are used to drive P3O1L /tau (a mutation linked to autosomal dominant fronto-temporal dementia with parkinsonism), neurofi- brillary tangles developed in neurons of the brain and spinal cord (Lewis et al., 2000; Gotz et al., 2001). Mice expressing APPswe/tau P301L show enhanced NFT pathology in limbic system and olfactory cortex (Lewis et al., 2001). Moreover, when A β 42 fibrils are injected into specific brain regions of tau P301L mice, the number of tangles was increased in those neurons projecting to sites of injection (Götz et al., 2001). More recently, a triple transgenic mouse (3xTg-AD) was created by microinject- ing APPswe and P3o1L/tau into single cells derived from monozygous PS1 M146V knock in mice (Oddo et al., 2003). These mice develop age-related plaques and tan- gles. Deficits in LTP appear to antedate overt pathology (Oddo et al., 2003) However, mice bearing both mutant 450 Alzheimer’s Disease Ch27.qxd 9/2/04 10:18 AM Page 450"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"tau and APP (or APP/PS1 ) or mutant tau mice injected with A β are not complete models of FAD because the presence of the tau mutation alone is associated with the development of tangles. Although mice expressing wt human tau transgene do not develop pathology, introduction of human tau into tau − / − mice leads to accumulations of tau immunoreac- tivity in neurons, including the presence of certain phos- phorylated and conformational epitopes occurring in human disease (Dr. Peter Davies, personal communica- tion). These observations have been interpreted to sug- gest that, in mice, endogenous mouse tau may interfere with the formation of tangles related to human tau. Thus, a more appropriate model of AD might be achieved by co-expression of mutant FA D -linked genes and all six isoforms of wild-type human tau on a mouse tau null background. GENE TARGETING To begin to understand the functions of some of the proteins thought to play roles in AD, investigators have targeted a variety of genes encoding the proteins, includ- ing APP , amyloid precursor–like proteins ( APLPs ), BACE1 , PS1 , Nct , and Aph1 . APP and APLPs Homozygous APP − / − mice are viable and fertile, but appear to have subtle decreases in locomotor activity and forelimb grip strength (Zheng et al., 1995). The absence of substantial phenotypes in APP − / − mice is thought to be related to functional redundancy of two amyloid precursor–like proteins, APLP1 and APLP2, homologous to APP (Wasco et al., 1993; Slunt et al., 1994). APLP2 − / − mice appear relatively normal (von Koch et al., 1997), while APLP1 mice exhibit a postna- tal growth deficit (Heber et al., 2000). APLP − / − mice are viable but, APP/APLP2 null mice and APLP1 and APLP2 null mice do not survive the perinatal period (Heber et al., 2000). These observations support the concept that redundancy exists between APLP2 and other members of this interesting family of proteins (Heber et al., 2000). BACE1 BACE1 null mice are viable and healthy, have no obvi- ous phenotype or pathology, and can mate successfully (Vassar et al., 2000; Cai et al., 2001; Luo et al., 2001, 2003; Cai et al., 2001). Importantly, cortical neurons cul- tured from BACE1 − / − embryos, do not show cleavages at the + 1 and + 11 sites of A β , and the secretion of A β peptides is abolished even in the presence of elevated lev- els of exogenous wt or mutant APP (Cai et al., 2001). The brains of BACE1 null mice appear morphologically normal and A β peptides are not produced (Luo et al., 2001; Cai et al., 2001). These results establish that BACE1 is the neuronal β -secretase required to cleave APP to generate the N-termini of A β (Cai et al., 2001). At present, a consensus has not been reached with regards to other substrates cleaved by BACE1. Behavioral studies of the null mice, in vitro and in vivo challenges of BACE1 neural cells, and two dimensional gels of organs from BACE1 + / + ,BACE + / − , and BACE − / − mice will be critical in determining the consequences of the absence of BACE1 on behavior, susceptibility to challenge/disease, and influence on other substrates that may be cleaved by this enzyme. At present, BACE1 appears to be an outstanding target for development of an anti-amyloidogenic therapy. PS1 and -2 In contrast to BACE1 null mice, PS1 − / − mice do not survive beyond the early postnatal period and show severe developmental abnormalities of the axial skele- ton, ribs, and spinal ganglia, features resembling a par- tial Notch 1 − / − phenotype (Wong et al., 1997; Shen et al., 1997). These abnormalities occur because PS1 (along with Nct, Aph1, and pen2) are components of the γ -secretase complex that carries out the S3 intramembra- nous cleavage of Notch1, a receptor protein involved in critical cell-fate decisions during development (De Strooper, 2003; Takasugi et al., 2003; Esler et al., 2002; Edbauer et al., 2002; Huppert et al., 2000; Struhl et al., 2001; De Strooper et al., 1999; Li et al., 2003; Francis et al., 2002). Without this cleavage, the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) is not released from the plasma membrane and does not reach the nucleus to ini- tiate transcriptional processes essential for cell fate deci- sions. In cell culture, absence of PS1 or substitution of particular aspartate residues leads to reduced levels of γ -secretase cleavage products and levels of A β (De Strooper et al., 1998; Wolfe et al., 1999). PS2 null mice are viable and fertile, although they develop age- associated mild pulmonary fibrosis and hemorrhage (Donoviel et al., 1999). Mice lacking PS1 and heterozy- gous for PS2 die midway through gestation with full Notch1 null-like phenotype (Donoviel et al., 1999). To study the role of PS1 in vivo in adult mice, investigators generated conditional PS1 -targeted mice lacking PS1 expression in the forebrain after embryonic development (Feng et al., 2001). As expected, the absence of PS1 resulted in decreased generation of A β , providing sup- port for the concept that PS1 is critical for γ -secretase activity in the brain. Alzheimer’s Disease 451 Ch27.qxd 9/2/04 10:18 AM Page 451"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"Nct, Aph1, and Pen2 Another critical member of the γ -secretase complex is Nct, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, which forms high-molecular-weight complexes with presenilins (Yu et al., 2000) and binds to the membrane-tethered form of Notch1 (Chen et al., 2001). Recent studies have indicated that Nct is required for Notch1 signaling and APP process- ing (Yu et al., 2000; Chung et al., 2001; Edbauer et al., 2002; Hu et al., 2002; Lopez-Schier et al., 2002; Li et al., 2003; De Strooper, 2003; Takasugi et al., 2003). Nct may function to stabilize PS and appears to be critical for the trafficking of PS to the cell surface (Li et al., 2003; Edbauer et al., 2002). Likewise, PS is required for the maturation and cell surface accumulation of Nct (Edbauer et al., 2002; Li et al., 2003). These results have suggested that Nct and PS form func- tional components of a multimeric complex required for the intramembraneous proteolysis of both Notch1 and APP. To determine whether Nct is required for proteolytic processing of Notch1 and APP in mammals and the role of Nct in the assembly of the γ -secretase complex, nicastrin- deficient ( NCT - / - ) mice were generated and fibroblasts were derived from NCT - / - embryos (Li et al., 2003). Nct -null embryos die by embryonic day 10.5 and exhibit several developmental patterning defects, including abnormal somite segmentation; the phenotype closely resembles that seen in embryos lacking Notch1 or both PS . Importantly, secretion of A β peptides is abolished in NCT - / - fibroblasts, whereas it is reduced by approximately 50% in NCT + / - cells (Li et al., 2003). The failure to generate A β peptides in NCT - / - cells is accompanied by destabilization of the presenilin/ γ -secretase complex and accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments. Moreover, analysis of APP traffick- ing in NCT - / - fibroblasts revealed a significant delay in the rate of APP reinternalization compared with that of con- trol cells. Thus, Nct, along with Aph1 and Pen2, is a critical component of the γ -secretase complex. These proteins are critical for stabilizing PS and for generation of A β (Francis et al., 2002; Li et al., 2003; De Strooper et al., 1999; De Strooper, 2003; Takasugi et al., 2003; Edbauer et al., 2002). These results establish that several proteins are essential components of the multimeric γ -secretase complex in mam- mals required for both γ -secretase activity and APP traf- ficking and suggest that these proteins may be a valuable therapeutic target for anti-amyloidogenic treatments (De Strooper, 2003; Li et al., 2003; Takasugi et al., 2003). WHY IS ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE A NEURONAL DISEASE? Among the most challenging mysteries of AD is the identification of factors that render the brain particularly susceptible to the extracellular deposition A β peptides. Recent research has begun to provide new clues concern- ing reasons why A β accumulates in the brain. A β is gen- erated from cleavages of APP by BACE1 and by an γ -secretase. In vivo , BACE1 is the principal β -secretase necessary to cleave APP to generate A β . In contrast, APP can also be cleaved within the A β sequence by α -secretases ( T umor N ecrosis F actor C onverting E nzyme or TACE) or by BACE2 to release the ectodomain of APP. These BACE2 and TACE cleavages within the A β domain of APP preclude the formation of A β . As subsequently out- lined, the presence of APP and pro-amyloidogenic secre- tase in the CNS may contribute substantially to the selective vulnerability of the A β amyloidosis. BACE1 and BACE2 are expressed ubiquitously, but levels of BACE1 mRNA are particularly high in brain and pancreas, whereas the levels of BACE2 mRNA are relatively low in all tissues, except in the brain, where it is nearly undetectable. Because BACE1 is the principal β -secretase in neurons and BACE2 (and TACE) limits the secretion of A β peptides, we propose that BACE1 is a pro-amyloidogenic enzyme, whereas BACE2 and TACE are anti-amyloidogenic enzymes. We hypothesize that the relative levels of BACE1 and the anti-amyloidogenic sec- retases, in concert with the abundance of APP in neu- rons, are major determinants of A β formation (Wong et al., 2001). In this model, the secretion of A β peptides would be expected to be highest from neurons in brain, as compared with other cell types or organs because CNS neurons (not peripheral nervous system nerve cells), express relatively high levels of BACE1 coupled with low levels of BACE2 and TACE. If the ratio of the level of BACE1 to BACE2 (or TACE) is one of the critical fac- tors that selectively predisposes the brain to the forma- tion of A β , it is not surprising that AD would involve the brain selectively. Seemingly inconsistent with this hypothesis is the observation that there are high levels of BACE1 mRNA in the pancreas (Bodendorf et al., 2001). However, It appears that BACE1 mRNA in pancreatic cells is alternatively spliced to generate a BACE1 isoform that is incapable of cleaving APP (Bodendorf et al., 2001); thus, A β is not deposited in the pancreas. Whether neurons are the source of APP giving rise to A β and has been debated (Wong et al., 2001). Significantly, key participants in A β amyloidosis, partic- ularly APP and BACE1, are synthesized by neurons, and appear to be colocalized within neurites in immediate proximity to sites of A β deposition in brain (Sheng et al., 2003). This observation provides circumstantial evidence consistent with a neuronal origin for A β in CNS. However, it is established that APP is cleaved by BACE1 in distal axon terminals to generate C-terminal amy- loidogenic peptides (Buxbaum et al., 1998); after local γ -secretase cleavage, A β appears in terminal folds. Consistent with this concept is the demonstration that 452 Alzheimer’s Disease Ch27.qxd 9/2/04 10:18 AM Page 452"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"lesions of entorhinal cortex or perforant pathway reduce the levels of A β and the numbers of plaques in termi- nal fields of these neurons (Sheng et al., 2002; Lazarov et al., 2002). EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS FOR ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE Experimental therapeutic efforts have focused on influencing A β production, aggregation, clearance, and downstream neurotoxicity. Although mutant transgenic mice do not recapitulate the full phenotype of AD, they represent excellent models of A β amyloidosis and are highly suitable for identification of therapeutic targets and for testing new treatments in vitro . In this short review, it is not possible to discuss all therapeutic efforts in mice. Therefore, we focus on a few examples. Secretase Activities Although both β - and γ -secretase activities represent therapeutic targets for the development of novel pro- tease inhibitors, at present BACE1 appears to be the most attractive target. It is the principal β -secretase in neurons (Luo et al., 2001; Cai et al., 2001; Wong et al., 2001; Wolfe, 2002; Vassar et al., 2000; Vassar et al., 1999). In contrast to PS1 − / − and Nct − / − mice (Wong et al., 1997; Shen et al., 1997; De Strooper et al., 1998; Li et al., 2003), the BACE1 − / − mice are viable and live a normal life span without developing an obvious phenotype (Cai et al., 2001). Significantly, in vitro , BACE1-deficient neurons fail to secrete A β even when co-expressing the APPswe and mutant PS1 genes (Cai et al., 2001; Luo et al., 2001). Moreover, mutant APP/PS1 mice lacking BACE1 do not produce A β and do not develop A β plaques in the brain (Cai et al. , submitted; Luo et al., 2003). These findings provide excellent rationale for focusing on the design of novel therapeutics to inhibit BACE1 activity in brain. PS, Nct, Aph1, and Pen2 are required for γ -secretase activity (Yu et al., 2000; Li et al., 2003; De Strooper, 2003; Francis et al., 2002; Takasugi et al., 2003; Wolfe, 2002). Recent work suggests that PS1 is essential for activity, but may not be the protease performing γ cleav- age (at least for Notch1) (Taniguchi et al., 2002). Because of the role of the γ -secretase complex in Notch process- ing, attempts are being made to try to design therapeutics that inhibit selectively γ -secretase activity with regard to APP while minimizing inhibition of the activity involved in Notch1 processing. This approach is being pursued in part, because several populations of cells, particu- larly hematopoietic stem cells, use Notch 1 signaling for cell-fate decisions even in adults. Many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and some academic laboratories are using high-throughput screen and molecular modeling strategies to discover compounds that inhibit these enzyme activities (Wolfe, 2002; Vassar et al., 2000; Vassar, 2001). Once lead com- pounds are identified, medicinal chemists will modify the agents to enhance efficacy, allow passage through the blood-brain barrier, and reduce any potential toxicities. Immunotherapy In both prevention and treatment trials in mutant mice, both A β immunization (with Freund’s adjuvant) and passive transfer of A β antibodies reduce levels of A β and plaque burden in mutant APP transgenic mice (Soderberg et al., 2003; Monsonego et al., 2003; Solomon, 2001; Wilcock et al., 2001, 2003; Bard et al., 2000; DeMattos et al., 2001, 2002a; Kotilinek et al., 2002; Morgan et al., 2000; Dodart et al., 2002; Schenk et al., 1999). Efficacy seems to be related to antibody titer. The mechanisms of enhanced clearance are not certain, but two not mutually exclusive hypotheses have been sug- gested: (1) a small amount of A β antibody reaches the brain, binds to A β peptides, promotes the disassembly of fibrils, and, via the Fc antibody domain, activated microglia enter lesion and remove A β (Schenk et al., 1999); or (2) serum antibodies serve as a sink to draw the amyloid peptides from the brain into the circulation, thus changing the equilibrium of A β in different compart- ments and promoting removal from the brain (DeMattos et al., 2001). These are not mutually exclusive mecha- nisms. Significantly, immunotherapy in transgenic mice is successful in partially clearing A β and attenuates learn- ing and behavioral deficits in at least two cohorts of mutant APP mice (Kotilinek et al., 2002; Morgan et al., 2000; Dodart et al., 2002). In humans, although phase 1 trials with A β peptide and adjuvant were not associated with any adverse events, phase 2 trials were suspended because of severe adverse reactions (meningoencephalitis) in a subset of patients (Monsonego et al., 2003; Nicoll et al., 2003). These events illustrate the challenges of extrapolating outcomes in mice to trials with humans. The pathology in this single case, consistent with T-cell meningitis (Nicoll et al., 2003), was interpreted to show some clearance of A β deposits (Nicoll et al., 2003). Specifically, some areas of cortex showed very few plaques, yet these regions contained a relatively high density of tangles, neuropil threads, and vascular amyloid deposits. There was a paucity of plaque-associated dystrophic neurites and astrocytic clusters. In some regions with low plaque densities, A β immunoreactivity was associated with microglia. T-cells were conspicuous in subarachnoid space and around some vessels (Nicoll et al., 2003). Alzheimer’s Disease 453 Ch27.qxd 9/2/04 10:18 AM Page 453"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"Interestingly, assessment of cognitive functions in 30 patients who received vaccination and booster immu- nizations disclosed that patients who generated antibod- ies had a slower decline in several functional measures over time (Hock et al., 2003). Investigators have contin- ued to pursue the passive immunization approach and passive immunization and attempting to make antigens that do not stimulate T-cell–mediated immunologic attacks (Monsonego et al., 2003). Clearance of A β Peptides It is established that amyloid burden can be signifi- cantly reduced by a variety of approaches, including immunotherapy, reducing BACE1 activity, etc. Revie wing the neuronal source of APP and secretases allows clear- ance to proceed with a new supply of protein critical for formation of A β . For example, lesions of the entorhinal cortex or the perforant pathway reduce the levels of A β and the number of plaques in the terminal fields (molec- ular dentate gyrus) of the ablated inputs (Sheng et al., 2002; Lazarov et al., 2002). This work clearly shows that APP is major source of the A β peptide in the brain and that A β is in a dynamic state capable of dramatic clearance (at least in mice). In another approach to reduce the amyloid burden, a Lentiviral vector system was used to express human neprilysin (NEP), a putative A β -degrading enzyme, in the brains of transgenic mice with amyloid deposits (Marr et al., 2003). Unilateral intercerebral injections of lentivirus expressing NEP reduce A β deposits and may attenuate neurodegenerative processes (Marr et al., 2003). Another approach has been to target copper and zinc, which are enriched in A β deposits in the brains of indi- viduals with AD (Cherny et al., 2001). It has been sug- gested that these metals play a role in aggregation of A β and local H 2 O 2 production and thus, their removal might attenuate the deposition of A β and its consequences. In one study, clioquinol, a brain-penetrant antibiotic that binds zinc and copper, appeared to reduce the levels of these metals in the brain (Cherny et al., 2001). Nine-week therapy was associated with a modest increase in soluble A β and a reduction in A β deposition in the brain. A human trial is in progress. A variety of other illustra- tions of therapeutic interaction to reduce A β burden are described in the literature. CONCLUSIONS The identification of genes mutated or deleted in the inherited forms of many neurodegenerative diseases has allowed investigators to create in vivo and in vitro model systems relevant to a wide variety of human neurological disorders (Wong et al., 2002; Duff, 1998; Bonini et al., 2003; Shulman et al., 2003; Zoghbi et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2001; Price et al., 1998a, 1998b). In this review, we emphasized the value of transgenic and gene targeted models and the lessons they provided for understanding mechanisms of AD, for identifying therapeutic targets, and for testing new treatments in models. For illustrative purposes, we focused on studies of the progeny of BACE1 - / - mice and mutant APP/PS1 transgenic mice, which provides a dramatic example of the impact of reducing activity of secretases. Over the past several years, research has provided extraordinary new informa- tion about the mechanisms of A β amyloidogenesis, the reasons for vulnerability of brain to amyloidosis, and the proteins that are potential therapeutic targets. New mod- els using conditional systems will allow investigators to examine the molecular mechanisms by which mutant proteins cause selective dysfunction and death of neu- rons and to delineate pathogenic pathways that can be tested by breeding strategies on RNAi injection methods that reduce levels of specific proteins. The results of these approaches will provide us with a better understanding of the mechanisms that lead to diseases and help us to design new treatments. Moreover, studies of mice and other mammalian species will be enormously helped by investigations of invertebrate organisms, such as Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila melanogaster , which provide excellent genetically manipulatable model systems for examining many aspects of neurodegenerative diseases (Shulman et al., 2003; Bonini et al., 2003; Zoghbi et al., 2002). Invertebrates harboring mutant transgenes can be gener- ated rapidly. The nervous systems of the animals are rel- atively simple and behaviors can be scored readily. Because these invertebrate models reproduce aspects of pathologies occurring in human neurodegenerative dis- eases, studies of these systems should prove very useful in delineating disease pathways, identifying suppressors and enhancers of these processes, and in testing the influences of drugs on phenotypes in flies and worms. In summary, investigations of genetically engineered (transgenic or gene targeted) mice have disclosed partici- pants in pathogenic pathways, have reproduced some of the features of human neurodegenerative disorders, have provided important new information about the disease mechanisms, and allowed identification of new therapeu- tic targets. This information has provided the basis for new therapeutic strategies that can be tested in models. These lines of research have made spectacular progress over the past few years, and we anticipate that future dis- coveries will lead to design of promising mechanism- based therapies that can be tested in models of this devastating disease. 454 Alzheimer’s Disease Ch27.qxd 9/2/04 10:18 AM Page 454"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors wish to thank the many colleagues who have worked at JHMI as well as those at other institutions for their contributions to some of the original work cited in this review and for their helpful discussions.

At remote cortical sites, other suppressing events occur, a process known as remote functional depression or diaschisis (Feeney and Baron, 1986; Seitz et al. , 1999). At least part of the recovery is thought to result from the gradual reversal of diaschisis. By studying diaschisis it became evident that it may con- tinue even after significant recovery has occurred. In addition to hypometabolism and inhibition, persistent remote effects include hyperexcitability and disinhibition. Another part of recovery is a result of behavioral com- pensation. The use of compensatory strategies is particu- larly seen in moderately to severely affected patients (Cirstea and Levin, 2000). One theory of recovery, known as vicariation of function, in which adjacent or remote structures from the damaged area are thought to take over the function of the damaged area, has been revived over the past decade due to several findings of functional plasticity after cortical injury (Xerri et al. , 1998). Plasticity is now known as the main underlying mechanism for recovery and the known modalities affect- ing plasticity as well as rehabilitative interventions mod- ulating plasticity will be discussed in detail. Interventions of repair will be mentioned briefly. Plasticity Brain plasticity is the concept that the brain is able to change (Hallett, 1999, 2000, 2001a, 2001b). Over the past decade, newly developed noninvasive mapping studies such as neuroimaging, electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography, or transcranial magnetic stim- ulation (TMS) in humans, corresponding to findings from neurophysiological and neuroanatomical studies in animals, provided substantial evidence that the adult brain is capable of significant functional plasticity. Neurons and neural networks can change their function in several ways. Knowledge about the cellular mecha- nisms that are likely to be responsible for plasticity in humans is important to set new goals for rehabilitation purposes. Cellular physiology has been studied in differ- ent model systems, and we still do not know which mech- anism applies to which phenomenon. First, a change in the balance of excitation and inhibition can happen very quickly. This process depends on the fact that neurons or neural pathways have a much larger region of anatomical connectivity than their usual territory of functional influence. A remarkable feature of the projecting pyram- idal neurons is that they all have extensive local collateral branches in addition to the afferent axon (Gosh and Porter, 1988). The branches synapse in the vicinity of the neuron and typically have substantial horizontal connec- tion systems (Hess and Donoghue, 1994). Together with the large amount of intracortical interneurons they build and connect to different networks or zones. Some zones may be kept in check by constant inhibition. If the inhi- bition is removed, the region of influence can be quickly augmented or enlarged in a process often called unmask- ing (Jacobs and Donoghue, 1991). A second process that can also be relatively fast is the activity dependent change of the efficacy of synapses by strengthening or weaken- ing. These processes, such as long-term potentiation 459 CHAPTER 28 Behavioral Intervention and Recovery from CNS Damage Bernhard Voller, MD Mark Hallett, MD Ch28.qxd 9/1/04 6:55 AM Page 459"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"(LTP) or long-term depression (LTD), were particularly investigated in the horizontal connections of the rat motor cortex (Hess et al. , 1996, Hess and Donoghue, 1996). This modification of synaptic strength in fact would also be necessary for a continually adjustable con- nectional network that would depend on ongoing levels and patterns of activity. In other words, the ability to flexibly change the connections may be one substrate for reorganization. A third process is a change in neuronal membrane excitability by intracellular modification of sodium channels throughout the soma and axon (Halter et al. , 1995). A fourth process is anatomical changes, which need a longer time, between days and weeks. Specific anatomical changes include sprouting of new axon terminals and formation of new synapses (Toni et al. , 1999). Results from animal studies indicate the presence of dendritic growth, dendritic branching, synapse formation and changes in the specific structure of synaptic connections in the cortical tissue surround- ing an injury and in the unlesioned hemisphere (Nudo et al. , 2001). All these processes operate in different periods and are not mutually exclusive. Certainly, one can be followed by another. Furthermore, it is not only the case that these processes can occur, they are constantly occurring. In general, brain plasticity is often involved following injury but not less important in normal motor control. Repair Growth factors, such as nerve growth factor (NGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1), enhance recovery of sensorimotor function in rats (Kawamata et al. , 1997, Kawamata et al. , 1998, Kolb et al. , 1997). The natural metabolite inosine, a purine nucleoside, produces actual rewiring in the rat brain, probably by expressing genes associated with axon growth (Chen et al. , 2002). Experimental treatments for spinal cord injury (SCI) include antibodies to block axonal growth inhibitors (e.g., the anti Nogo A antibody IN-1), gangliosides to augment neuritic growth (e.g., chondroitinase ABC), implanting genetically pretreated fibroblasts that secret trophic factors such as NT-3, administration of 4-aminopyridine to enhance axonal conduction through demyelinated nerve fibers, implanta- tion of fetal tissue for bridging completed lesions, and implantation of olfactory glia cells that migrate into the host tissue and carry regenerating axons with them (Fawcett, 2002, Kirshblum et al. , 2002). Transplanted cells may preserve existing host cells and connections by secreting trophic factors, establishing local connections that enhance synaptic activity, provid- ing a bridge for host axonal regeneration, or actually replacing cellular elements (Wechsler and Kondziolka, 2003). There is some evidence in rat models that implan- tation of new cells might lead to restitution of lost tissue and rewiring (Veizovic et al. , 2001). Although a primate model is still missing, there are already human trials in stroke using cultured human neuronal cells derived from a teratocarcinoma cell line. The safety and feasibility of transplantation was studied in 12 patients with basal ganglia stroke and fixed motor deficits (Kondziolka et al. , 2000). Serial evaluations over an 18-month period showed no adverse effects. Although there was a benefit in some of the 12 patients in the European Stroke Scale score and an improvement of fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the positron emission tomography (PET) scans at the implant site, this study is still preliminary and controver- sial (Meltzer et al. , 2001). It is unclear whether and how the implanted cells contributed to the outcome. REHABILITATIVE INTERVENTIONS MODULATING PLASTICITY Enhancement of Function by Use of a Body Part Physical Exercise Therapy Cortical representation areas increase or decrease depending on use. For instance, Braille readers use their fingers many hours daily in the skilled task of interpret- ing the Braille characters. Detailed mapping of the motor cortical areas was performed with TMS targeting the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) and the adductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles bilaterally in Braille readers and blind controls (Pascual-Leone et al. , 1995). The FDI is used for reading, while the ADM is largely passive. In the controls, motor representations of right and left FDI and ADM were not significantly different. However, in the proficient Braille readers, the representation of the FDI in the reading hand was significantly larger than that in the nonreading hand or in either hand of the controls. In addition, the representation of the ADM in the reading hand was significantly smaller than that in the non- reading hand or in either hand of the controls, suggest- ing that the cortical representation for the reading finger in proficient Braille readers is enlarged at the expense of the representation of other fingers. In another study looking at cortical plasticity in patients who had a uni- lateral immobilization of the ankle joint with no periph- eral nerve lesion, the motor cortex area of the inactivated tibialis anterior muscle diminished compared to the unaffected leg (Liepert et al. , 1995). It is assumed that different interventions such as phys- ical exercise therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy facilitate such changes. Specific evidence demon- strating the values of specific interventions is sparse. Comparisons between different methods currently in use 460 Behavioral Intervention and Recovery from CNS Damage Ch28.qxd 9/1/04 6:55 AM Page 460"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"have failed so far to show that one strategy is highly superior to the other (Woldag and Hummelsheim, 2002). However, the concept of intensive physical exercise ther- apy after stroke has been best demonstrated by the con- straint-induced movement therapy (CI) (Miltner et al. , 1999, Taub et al. , 1993, Taub et al. , 1999). This method forces use of the hemiplegic limb by constraining the good limb. In a number of clinical trials, there has been behavioral improvement even in patients with chronic and apparently stable deficits. It was shown that TMS maps of the weakened muscles increase in size in this cir- cumstance showing that the expected cortical changes are occurring (Liepert et al. , 2000, Liepert et al. , 1998, Liepert et al. , 2000). In experiments at the National Institutes of Health, we studied 16 patients a year or more following stroke randomized to either con- straint-induced movement therapy or control therapy (Wittenberg et al. , 2003, Wittenberg et al. , 2000). Clinical assessments performed before and after the intervention and at 6 months after the intervention included the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), the Motor Activity Log (MAL), and the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS). MAL was signifi- cantly increased in the CI group, while the other meas- ures did not differ significantly. Furthermore, cerebral activation assessed with PET during a motor task decreased significantly and TMS motor map size increased in the affected motor cortex in CI patients only (Figure 28.1). Other techniques that likely use the same principle of physical exercise therapy are robot-enhanced training, virtual reality training, mental practice, music therapy, bilateral arm training, and electrical stimulation. Robotic Devices and Virtual Reality Systems Robotic devices may be used to help with physical exercise training. In robot-aided sensorimotor training, the subject is given a goal-directed task; the robotic device measures the movement and, if necessary, guides the limb to its target. In one study, 56 patients with stroke and hemiparesis or hemiplegia received standard post- stroke multidisciplinary rehabilitation, and were ran- domly assigned either to receive robotic training (at least 25 hours) or exposure to the robotic device without train- ing (Volpe et al. , 2000). By the end of treatment, the robot-trained group demonstrated improved motor out- come for the trained shoulder and elbow that did not generalize to the untrained wrist and hand. The robot- treated group also demonstrated significantly improved functional outcome. In another study, four modes of robot-assisted movements patterned after exercises cur- rently used in therapy were promoted: passive mode, active-assisted mode, active-constraint mode, and biman- ual mode (Lum et al. , 2002). Compared with the con- trol group which received conventional therapy, the robot group had larger improvements in the proximal movement portion of the Fugl-Meyer test, larger gains in strength and larger increases in reach extent for up to two months. Although it is unclear whether robot-assisted movement has unique therapeutic effects that cannot be provided by a human therapist some advantages may exist, such as a minimized need for supervision, the possibility of higher intensity of individualized ther- apy, and better applicability to more severely impaired subjects. Virtual reality systems are also being applied to reha- bilitation (Holden et al. , 2001). For instance, a personal computer-based desktop virtual reality system can be used to rehabilitate hand function in stroke patients (Jack et al. , 2001). The system uses two input devices, a CyberGlove and a Rutgers Master II-ND (RMII) force feedback glove, allowing user interaction with a virtual environment. Specific virtual reality exercises were cre- ated in which the intensity of practice and the feedback Behavioral Intervention and Recovery from CNS Damage 461 FIGURE 28.1 TMS maps of a stroke patient before and after CI ther- apy.

Pilot clinical trials were conducted with 6 chronic stroke patients in two case series (Merians et al. , 2002). Objective measurements showed that each patient improved on most of the hand parameters, lasting in one study for over three weeks. Mental Practice and Music Therapy Because mental practice activates much of the same circuitry in the brain as does real action, it is not surpris- ing that even mental practice has been demonstrated to be useful in motor rehabilitation (Deiber et al. , 1998; Page et al. , 2001; Pascual-Leone et al. , 1995). The inter- action of rhythm, an essential structure of music, and the human motor system, is obvious. However, until recently this had never been substantiated by neurophysiological research (Thaut et al. , 1999). The beneficial effect of rhythmic facilitation on gait parameters (e.g., velocity, stride length) has now been demonstrated in stroke patients (Thaut et al. , 1997). Methods are all presumably effective not only due to the increased use of the affected body part, but also because of attempted learning of new skills, attention to the task, and reward. Ipsilateral Pathways General Findings Although rather weak in humans, there are ipsilateral pathways that could theoretically contribute to motor recovery. In classical functional anatomy studies, it was suggested that these pathways are more prominent in operating the proximal part of the limbs, but they can be documented even in normal humans even in distal muscles (Brinkman and Kuypers, 1973; Gazzaniga, 1970). From TMS studies, two candidates in the CNS were proposed to play a role in ipsilateral conduction: first, the ipsilateral uncrossed direct pyramidal tract; second, the bilateral cortico-reticulospinal pathway (Lawrence and Kuypers, 1968, 1968). Ipsilateral pathways are certainly involved in recovery in patients with hemispherectomy, often used to treat intractable epilepsy or neoplasms. It is unclear by which neural mechanisms these patients regain reasonable motor function in muscle groups contralateral to the cerebral damage. TMS of the remaining hemisphere induces bilateral activation of proximal arm muscles, demonstrating the existence of ipsilateral pathways in this condition (Benecke et al. , 1991; Cohen et al. , 1991). It is possible, although controversial, that these pathways are also relevant in stroke recovery (Hallett, 2001a, 2001b). The clinical observation that unilateral hemi- spheric lesions in patients with stroke can induce bilateral motor deficits also points to a possible bilateral cerebral control of the motor function of one side of the body (Colebatch and Gandevia, 1989; Jones et al. , 1989; Kim et al. , 2003). After stroke, the intact hemisphere plays a crucial role in recovery from dysphagia (Hamdy et al. , 1998). In another TMS study, functional recovery of movements of the tongue after stroke was strongly related to the function of the intact hemisphere (Muellbacher et al. , 1999). Recruitment of the ipsilateral unaffected sensorimo- tor cortex after brain injury has also been identified using single-photon emission tomography (Sabatini et al. , 1994), PET (Chollet et al. , 1991; Weiller et al. , 1992; Weiller et al. , 1993), and fMRI (Cao et al. , 1998; Cramer et al. , 1997). In these studies, profound ipsilateral hemi- spheric activation during contraction of the affected (recovered) hand in stroke patients was documented. In contrast to normal patterns of activation after move- ments of the affected hand, increased activation was mostly found in the areas of ipsilateral sensorimotor cor- tex, premotor cortex, supplementary motor area (SMA), insula, inferior parietal cortex, and contralateral cerebel- lum. In one study, in addition to the activation of an ipsi- lateral motor network in the unaffected hemisphere, two other possible processes of motor recovery were sug- gested: increased degree of SMA activation and activa- tion of foci along the rim of a cortical infarct (Cramer et al. , 1997). In a recent review, it was suggested from results of MRI and PET studies that following stroke, the main mechanism underlying motor recovery involves enhanced activity of preexisting networks, with the con- cept that the greater the involvement of the ipsilateral motor network, the better the recovery (Calautti and Baron, 2003). Another possible influence from the undamaged hemisphere could come from transcallosal connections. Some of these transcallosal connections are inhibitory and these may be inhibited by training, in particular by bilateral training. One fMRI study shows increased blood flow in the damaged hemisphere when movements are made bilaterally which is consistent with the idea that activity of the ipsilateral hemisphere may be supportive of the damaged hemisphere (Figure 28.2; see also Color Plate section) (Staines et al. , 2001). Bilateral Arm Training Although not fully understood, it does seem that attempts to perform bilateral symmetrical arm move- ment are helpful in motor rehabilitation via the mecha- nism of interhemispheric disinhibition. In a report on 12 462 Behavioral Intervention and Recovery from CNS Damage Ch28.qxd 9/1/04 6:55 AM Page 462"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"single-case experiments, improvement was shown follow- ing bilateral training, at least in the trained task (Mudie and Matyas, 2000). In the unimpaired brain during uni- lateral action, the ipsilateral hemisphere is inhibited, as unilateral actions are executed only by contralateral pathways. In unilateral stroke, there is inhibition by diaschisis in the damaged hemisphere during movement of the affected limb as well as inhibition coming from the undamaged side through the corpus callosum. The latter is thought to be more active in stroke patients than in healthy persons, because the undamaged side is hyper- active after stroke. This also occurs because the undam- aged hemisphere controls the undamaged one less by inhibition. It is theorized that the strong interhemispheric inhibi- tion originating in the undamaged hemisphere may be overcome by bimanual movements. Three different path- ways that could be activated during bimanual training were proposed. First, it is known that motor neurons of the ipsilateral pathway are disinhibited during bilateral action. In the damaged hemisphere, the spared cells of the ipsilateral pathway could be encouraged to directly interact with the adjacent spared cells of the contralat- eral pathway. Second, indirect corticospinal pathways could be recruited, such as cortico-reticulospinal path- ways. Third, ipsilateral pathways from the undamaged hemisphere serving the affected limb could be utilized because they are potentially freer to be involved in the concurrent activity with contralateral pathways of the damaged hemisphere. Regardless of how bilateral training works, another version that seems promising is repetitive bilateral arm training with rhythmic auditory cueing (BATRAC). In a study of 14 patients with chronic hemiparetic stroke, 6 weeks of BATRAC were performed (Whitall et al. , 2000). Four 5-minute periods per session (three times per week) of BATRAC were administered using a custom- designed arm training machine. The patients showed significant and potentially long-lasting increases in the Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Motor Performance Test of impairment, the Wolf Motor Function Test, and the University of Maryland Arm Questionnaire for Stroke. Isometric strength and active and passive ranges of motion improved in several joints of the paretic arm. These benefits were largely sustained 8 weeks after training concluded. Mirror Therapy A version of sensory feedback that is also related to bilateral arm movement is mirror therapy. Mirror ther- apy was reported as effective in a patient with poor func- tional use of an upper extremity, due mainly to somatosensory deficits (Sathian et al. , 2000). The subject underwent rehabilitation of the weak arm by being asked Behavioral Intervention and Recovery from CNS Damage 463 Both Relative Intensity 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.05 Affected Unaffected 2 weeks post-stroke 9 days post-stroke Patient 2 RL cs cs Patient 1 FIGURE 28.2 Functional MRI during repetitive unilateral or bilateral hand grips of two patients with right hemispheric stroke.

Thus, there was illusory visual feedback of movement. This therapy was reported to be useful in functional recovery. Sensory Stimulation Somatosensory feedback is required for precise motor performance. In stroke patients, the finding that somatosensory deficits are usually associated with a slower recovery of motor function provides further evidence for the important role of somatosensory input (Reding and Potes, 1988). Techniques able to induce brain plasticity via sensory input may also help to improve function. Electric Stimulation A prolonged period of peripheral nerve stimulation increases excitability of related muscle representations in the motor cortex using TMS (Ridding et al. , 2000). In some circumstances, even the motor mapping changes (Ridding et al. , 2001). Sensory stimulation may be given in different ways, from passive movement to cutaneous and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and even acupuncture. While there is some evidence for the effi- cacy of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (Tekeoglu et al. , 1998) and acupuncture (Wong et al. , 1999), there is also contrary evidence (Hummelsheim et al. , 1997; Johansson et al. , 2001). In isolated cases, electrical stimulation may improve function in part by improving inattention (Mackenzie-Knapp, 1999). Stimulation of the pharynx may improve swallowing function (Hamdy et al. , 2001). Recently, a new technique combining peripheral and central stimulation was performed (Stefan et al. , 2000). In healthy volunteers, high-frequency peripheral stimula- tion induced prolonged facilitation for up to 40 minutes (Pitcher et al. , 2003). Another technique is transcranial direct current stimulation. It was shown that weak anodal stimulation of M1 resulted in increased implicit learning in healthy subjects, whereas stimulation of other motor areas or stimulation with opposite current flow did not improve performance (Nitsche et al. , 2003). Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation In a controlled study, neuromuscular electrical stimu- lation (NMES) was electromyographically triggered on the wrist and finger extension muscles in 11 chronic stroke patients (Cauraugh et al. , 2000). The voluntary initiation of the electrical activity in the wrist extensor muscle served as a stimulus for the onset of electrical stimulation. These movements produced externally enhanced proprioceptive feedback, theoretically com- pleting the sensorimotor cycle and rendering the treat- ment effect. Subjects completed 12 30-minute treatment sessions. After the rehabilitation treatment, the experi- mental group moved significantly more blocks in the Box and Block test and displayed a higher isometric force impulse in a force generation task. In another study, it was shown that NMES may be useful even if not elec- tromyographically triggered (Powell et al. , 1999). In a study similar to the previous NMES study (Cauraugh et al. , 2000), a second, simultaneous intervention— bilat- eral arm movement triggered by NMES—was added on 25 stroke patients (Cauraugh and Kim, 2002). In the cou- pled protocol group, results for the numbers of blocks moved in the functional task, reaction times to initiate movements and sustained muscle contraction capabilities were superior to those in the unilateral NMES or the control group. This study promotes a new approach in rehabilitation research, because two different mecha- nisms for activating the sensorimotor cortex to improve recovery are combined. Reduction of Inhibition Deafferentation as a Modulator of Cortical Plasticity Amputation and transient deafferentation (e.g., by nerve blocks) are associated with plastic changes in the human motor system (Brasil-Neto et al. , 1993; Cohen et al. , 1991; Fuhr et al. , 1992; Kew et al. , 1994; Ridding and Rothwell, 1995). Muscles located close to the stump or to the deafferented limb are activated by TMS more easily and from more scalp positions than the same muscles in the control side in amputees or in normal experimentally pre-deafferented controls (Chen et al. , 2002). A PET study showed increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the contralateral sensorimotor cor- tex with movement of the amputated side compared to the normal side (Kew et al. , 1994). These results are com- patible with the development of more (sprouting) or stronger (unmasking) corticomotoneuronal connections targeting muscles close to the stump or area of experi- mental deafferentation, and indicate that deafferentation is an adequate trigger of cortical plasticity. Additionally, it is known that the deafferented motor cortex, during a forearm ischemic nerve block, becomes modifiable by inputs that are normally subthreshold for inducing changes in excitability. Plastic changes in the deafferented cortex can be up-regulated by direct transcranial stimu- lation of the plastic cortex, and down-regulated by TMS stimulation of the opposite cortex; that is, it can be mod- ulated. This noninvasive modulation of deafferentation- induced plasticity might be used to facilitate plasticity 464 Behavioral Intervention and Recovery from CNS Damage Ch28.qxd 9/1/04 6:55 AM Page 464"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"when it is primarily beneficial, or to suppress it when it is predominantly maladaptive (Ziemann et al. , 1998). A combination of motor training and experimental deafferentation can lead to enhanced cortical plasticity. Motor practice of the upper arm in the presence of experimental distal deafferenta tion substantially increases the electrophysiological measures of cortical plasticity in normal volunteers (Ziemann et al. , 2001). These results indicate that use-dependent plasticity is substantially potentiated in the human motor cortex after experimental deafferentation. The effect of sensory deafferentation of the proximal arm combined with practice on recovery of hand func- tion after chronic stroke was investigated in six patients with monohemispheric stroke. Brachial plexus blockade through the interscalene approach has been proven to be a safe and effective method that selectively blocks the upper portion of the brachial plexus branches without influencing hand function. Although patients showed significant enhancement of pinch power and acceleration together with motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes after repetitive sessions of practices alone, these practice- related changes were further enhanced under local anesthesia of the proximal arm (Muellbacher et al. , 2002). Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation TMS can produce a brief excitation or inhibition of the brain. When delivered repetitively, there may be longer effects, some of which appear to outlast the period of stim- ulation. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) has been tested for several years as a nonpharmacological, noninvasive method of directly influencing patients’ cortical functions. A growing number of studies have utilized the modulatory effects of rTMS on cortical excitability (Wassermann and Lisanby, 2001). In general, high-frequency rTMS enhances cortical excitability and slow-frequency rTMS reduces excitability. High-frequency rTMS seems to improve motor function when applied to the primary motor areas in Parkinson patients (Pascual-Leone et al. , 1994; Siebner et al. , 2000; Sommer et al. , 2002). Strategies to decrease the inhibitory effects in the brain after stroke would focus on enhancing the process of plasticity after neural injury by changing the efficacy of already existing pathways and synapses, i.e., by the mechanisms of unmasking or LTP. It seems reasonable, for example, that the combination of motor training and decrease of inhibition by rTMS could lead to enhanced cortical plasticity. Pharmacological Interventions Another method to improve rehabilitation is combin- ing use of drug therapy with motor training. Studies in general indicate that the combination is important. Although the mechanisms of neurotransmitter-modulated recovery are unknown, the best documented influence is with amphetamine and related noradrenergic agents (Feeney, 1997; Feeney et al. , 1993; Gladstone and Black, 2000). Amphetamine analogs (Table 28.1) or α 2 -adrenergic receptor agonists accelerate motor recov- ery after experimental brain injury (Goldstein, 2000). Amphetamines may produce increased blood pressure, behavioral arousal, and hypermotility. In addition to the changes in rCBF, the actions of amphetamine may be mediated through noradrenergic, dopaminergic, or sero- toninergic neurons. While it is possible that amphetamine has its effect by relieving diaschisis, it also seems to enhance plastic changes in motor learning situations in animals and humans (Lee and Ma, 1995; Soetens et al. , 1995). There is also evidence for enhanced neural sprout- ing and synaptogenesis (Stroemer et al. , 1998). There are several clinical trials demonstrating that amphetamine together with physical therapy is more effective than physical therapy alone (Crisostomo et al. , 1988; Walker- Batson et al. , 1995). However, other studies have shown no effect (Sonde et al. , 2001). Some antidepressants and dopamine agonists have also been shown to be useful (see Table 28.1). The atten- tion of clinicians involved in stroke rehabilitation has been particularly drawn to three prospective, random- ized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In the first study, the effect of methylphenidate was studied in 21 patients (Grade et al. , 1998). Treatment was given for 3 weeks in conjunction with physical therapy. Methylphenidate appeared to be both safe and effec- tive. Second, levodopa was studied in 53 patients (Scheidtmann et al. , 2001). For the first 3 weeks, patients received single doses of levodopa (100 mg) or placebo daily in combination with physiotherapy, and for the second 3 weeks patients had only physiotherapy. Motor recovery was significantly improved after 3 weeks of drug intervention in the levodopa group and was maintained at 6 weeks. Third, the effect of fluoxetine and maprotiline was studied in 52 patients (Dam et al. , 1996). Patients randomly either received one of the two drugs or placebo over 3 months with physical therapy. Functional indices improved most in the fluoxetine group. All three stud- ies seemed to confirm some results of animal studies, although they remain controversial. On the other hand, some drugs have been demon- strated to impair recovery in animals and humans (see Table 28.1). These are antihypertensives, such as cloni- dine and prazosin; major tranquilizers, such as haloperi- dol, fluanisone, and droperidol; antidepressants, such as trazodone; anxiolytics, such as diazepam or phenobarbi- tal; and anticonvulsants, such as phenytoin (Goldstein, 1995, 1997, 2000).

On the other, it seems logical to avoid drugs suspected of impairing recovery when alternatives are available in the clinical situation (e.g., hypertension and mood disturbances). Restorative Devices Whereas robotic devices are used for physical exercise therapy, other prosthetic devices are used for restoring function only. Prostheses can be entirely robotic or con- trol a patient’s limb by providing functional electrical stimulation to remaining muscle groups. Weak attempts at contraction may be detected and enhanced purely peripherally either with surface stimulation electrodes (Handmaster NMS-1, Bionic Glove, ETHZ-ParaCare neuroprosthesis and others) (Popovic et al. , 2001; Prochazka et al. , 1997; Snoek et al. , 2000) or by elec- trodes implanted in muscles (Freehand system, NEC FESMate system) (Smith et al. , 1987). The available neu- roprostheses for grasping enable the restoration of the two most frequently used grasping styles, the palmar and the lateral grasp (Popovic et al. , 2002). For patients with severe wide-ranging neuromuscular disorders and significant preserved cognitive function, EEG signals can provide a nonmuscular channel for send- ing commands to an external world, namely by a brain- computer interface (BCI). Successful operations require that the user encode commands in these signals and that the BCI derives the commands from the signals. Over time the user and the BCI necessarily have to adapt to each other. It has been shown for years that EEG can be used to control cursor movements with several degrees of freedom (Wolpaw et al. , 2000; Wolpaw, McFarland, and Vaughan, 2000). Such a control system has been demon- strated to control a device such as hand grasp prosthesis (Lauer et al. , 1999). The development of a BCI for multi- ple and complex movements would require, however, an implantable multi-microelectrode array. This would need to be coupled with a real-time conversion of simultane- ously recorded neural activity to an online command for movement. Some progress is being made in this area (Isaacs et al. , 2000; Lauer et al. , 2000). Direct control of the BCI has been used in animal studies by intracortically implanted electrodes. New developments have also been made in cortical input devices implied for sensory loss (Donoghue, 2002). Spasticity Management (Botulinum toxin) While plasticity often produces functional improve- ment after brain damage, it may also produce unwanted effects, such as the development of spasticity. Management of spasticity may therefore also influence plasticity in a beneficial way. In spasticity, pharmacolog- ical agents such as the benzodiazepines, baclofen, tizani- dine, or clonidine influence spinal cord function. Baclofen and clonidine can be given intrathecally to increase their effective dose. Muscles can be weakened with dantrolene. A special note should be made of the utility of botulinum toxin. With botulinum toxin a focal reduction in muscle tone, painful spasms, and improved functionality can be obtained with fewer side effects (Esquenazi and Mayer, 2001). Also in general, spasticity must be approached carefully, because it may sometimes be useful for function. CONCLUSION, PERSPECTIVES, AND HORIZONS This is an exciting time for neurorehabilitation, because there is a wide variety of treatment options available. The occasional preoccupation with hyperacute and acute intervention in brain damage, especially in stroke, while critically important, should not lead one to neglect testing interventions that might enhance recovery in more chronic stages. The challenge is to identify which of the many changes observed are important and beneficial in mediat- ing recovery and which are accessible by various treat- ments and to what extent. Of course, prevention and acute treatment are to be preferred, but if cerebral damage occurs, there is now considerable hope for patients.

The notion that the distribution of radio labeled tracers would pro- vide functional information regionally throughout the brain was quickly applied using positron-emitting radio- tracers (Phelps et al. , 1975). The detection of positron emitting isotopes with positron emission tomography (PET) cameras was quantitative and the unit of function could be calibrated in terms of radioactivity deposited in a volume of tissue over time. These techniques were rap- idly used to investigate pathophysiology, especially in relation to energy metabolism with the use of oxygen- 15–labeled water, oxygen, and fluorine-18–labeled glu- cose (Frackowiak, 1989). In the middle 1980s, multi-slice tomographs with rapid response characteristics enabled dynamic measurement of local cerebral blood flow (Fox et al. , 1988). This ability was exploited to make repetitive measurements of local brain function using flow as an indirect index of synaptic activity. The era of mak- ing dynamic measurements of specific human brain functions in a reasonable time period was upon us. In the early 1990s, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using the blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) technique appeared (Kwong et al. , 1992). The major advantage was that it eschewed the use of radioisotopes, thus making it safer and repeatable on innumerable occasions in normal volunteers and patients. A major disadvantage was the inability to cali- brate the BOLD signal and an incomplete understanding of its origins. It is certainly largely dependent on the bal- ance between oxyhemoglobin and de-oxyhemoglobin, which have different magnetic properties, at sites where local brain activity changes, but it is also associated with local increases of perfusion and blood volume. In fact, the BOLD signal is an indirect index of local oxy- gen extraction—when the BOLD signal is high, oxygen extraction is low. Recently, empirical evidence indicates that the BOLD signal accurately reflects local field potentials in the brain (Logothetis et al. , 2001). This observation confirms the idea that activation reflects neural activity in projecting axons arriving in the den- dritic arbors at a site in the brain. The activation also includes local neural processing, but the dominant influ- ence is likely to be exerted by excitatory afferents to a brain region. These advances have lead to an explosion of studies of the functional anatomy of normal human brain (Frackowiak et al. , 1997). It is on the basis of results from normal brains in the past 10 years and the increasing input from neuropsychologists and other neu- roscientists using scanning to define systems level cere- bral physiology that future applications to clinical neurology will be based. In the first 5 years of the 1990s, novel statistical meth- ods were introduced and systematically validated. These are sometimes collectively called Statistical Parametric Mapping. They were developed for the analysis of func- tional scans (Friston et al. , 1991; Friston et al. , 1995, 1995a; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) but recently they have also been applied to the analysis of structural MRI scans providing accurate definition of local brain anatomy—so-called voxel-based morphometry (VBM) (Ashburner and Friston, 2001; Good et al. , 2002). Indeed, a number of sophisticated morphometric meth- ods based on structural MRI scanning of the brain are 471 CHAPTER 29 What Functional Brain Imaging Will Mean for Neurology Richard S.J.

The armamen- tarium of the clinical neuroscientist is now complete. Broca brought anatomy and behavior together in his pioneering observations on the patient “Tan” in 1862. The modern clinical neuroscientist interested in sys- tems-level analysis of the brain is now able to bring together sophisticated, accurate, and bias-free measure- ments of local brain function, and anatomy, to add to clinical observations and behavioral manipulations. The quantitative nature of the data, the elimination of observer bias through the use of automated analytic computer algorithms, and an increasing appreciation of the principles underlying functional brain organization, both in terms of local specialization and integration between functionally specialized areas, makes this a particularly exciting time. The application of modern neuroimaging to diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeu- tics is upon us. It remains to be seen what the eventual impact will be. ENABLING METHODOLOGICAL ADVANCES Systematic Image Analysis Procedures Eliminating Observer Bias Functional brain maps and indeed, structural MRI images, are essentially matrixes of data elements known as voxels. There are as many as 100,000 per scanned brain volume. In imaging experiments based on BOLD, many sequential brain scans may be recorded in a sin- gle session. Each scan will be collected under particular conditions or in a particular physiological or behav- ioral context. Scans may be collected in health and in disease. The subsequent analysis of these scans aims to detect significant areas of change of function or anatomy that may be localized or distributed among a number of regions or in a particular tissue compart- ment; for example, gray matter. The analytical proce- dure therefore requires comparisons in a statistical sense of many individual data points. To draw valid inferences from these comparisons, a clinical scientist has to protect against false-positive and false-negative results. Classically, protection against false-positive results is done with the Bonferroni correction, although typically, that modification applies to multiple inde- pendent comparisons. The voxels in a brain image are not independent. They are linked by virtue of the reso- lution of the camera so that the values in adjacent voxels are correlated. They are also correlated with adjacent and distant voxels by common physiological responses. The problem is therefore one of correcting for multiple non-independent comparisons. The general linear model and theory of Gaussian Random Fields is a favored method of estimating the actual number of independent comparisons to make the appropriate connections. This major advance in statistics allows valid influences to be drawn from imaging data (Worsley et al. , 1996). Analysis of structural scans is classically done by an expert using the eye and clinical experience. Although extremely efficient at detecting focal changes in brain structure that method is not good at detecting or inter- preting diffuse changes in gray matter volume, white matter integrity, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes. Contemporary morphometric methods of choice use observer-dependent manual delineation of brain struc- tures and pixel counting to detect atrophy in regions of interest (e.g., the hippocampus) (Watkins et al. , 2002). Such methods have been useful but are subject to observer bias that frequently needs to be controlled by test-retest and receiver-operator characteristic analysis. The more modern voxel-based computerized techniques are fully automated and therefore observer bias is eliminated, which is a significant advantage. Another major advance in structural and functional brain mapping that renders them more clinically relevant is the introduction of novel imaging test paradigms. The classical experiment of comparing brain function in one state with that in another and attributing changes in activity to differences in the two states has been supple- mented by more complex and informative paradigms. Categorical comparisons are good for delineating func- tionally specialized brain areas such as those found in early perceptual pathways. However, brain areas may respond to changes in stimuli in a nonlinear fashion. One way of examining such response characteristics is to use a parametric design where brain function is correlated with a systematic change in the relevant stimulus. The responses of brain areas may also differ in various contexts, for example, in different pathological states. Scanning can be done so that categorical or parametric comparisons are repeated in both states and then con- trasted. Such factorial designs elucidate nonlinear rela- tionships between activities in different areas under different conditions. This type of scanning paradigm is particularly informative for studying effects of therapy. Functional scans can be collected with and without a stimulus of interest and the patterns of activation recorded in the presence of active treatment and placebo. The difference between activations in the two therapeutic conditions will show the site at which therapy is having its physiological effect (Pariente et al. , 2001). Most recently, induced changes in activity between different brain regions, in functional brain systems, have been quantified using advanced techniques such as Effective Connectivity Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling (Rowe et al. , 2002). The ability to detect 472 What Functional Brain Imaging Will Mean for Neurology Ch29.qxd 9/1/04 6:56 AM Page 472"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"systematic and significant changes of correlated activ- ity in a complex brain system, comprising a number of functionally specialized areas, is particularly promis- ing for those interested in the treatment of complex behaviors. fMRI has a relatively poor temporal resolution com- pared to its exquisite spatial resolution. Nevertheless, techniques are now available that permit one to distin- guish activity in two different states with a resolution of approximately 1 second (Josephs and Henson, 1999). These event-related scans are to be compared with scans that are blocked. In these latter scans, the stimu- lus is given over a finite period, often 20–30 seconds, to generate a single activity map per stimulus type. With event related scanning, the response to each individual stimulus is recorded. There are a number of advantages that accrue from event related scanning. Scans can be classified, post hoc, on the basis of some behavioral or physiological response, task difficulty, or other param- eter, and then compared. The method acknowledges that brain responses often habituate with constant stimuli and provides a way of identifying transient activity in such situations by avoiding habituating situ- ations. A relative disadvantage of the event-related method is that it is statistically less powerful than the blocked method. Small Study Populations with Sufficient Statistical Power Functional brain imaging provides quantitative data on local brain activity and has sufficient statistical power to allow detection of small changes in brain func- tion with relatively small subject groups. This capability is particularly useful for screening treatments for effec- tiveness, as well as defining appropriate dosage sched- ules before phase three trials of clinical efficacy. With the blocked method, as a rule no more than six to ten subjects are required to generate a significant result. With the Event Related Method, when the aim is to pro- vide an answer relevant to the study population (fixed effects), a similar number of subjects or patients is required. If generalization to the population of which the study group is representative is wanted, then 16 to 24 subjects are usually necessary to account for random error. Standard power calculations of scanning studies are difficult because of the interaction and inter- dependence of voxels. However, a decade of experience has provided the empirical rules described above. The signal to noise characteristics of MR scans are very favorable, so that 1% changes in signal can be accurately determined using standard scanning techniques and magnets and the numbers of subjects described previ ously (Friston et al. , 1999). Creation of Structural and Functional Atlases of Normal Populations and Patients Atlases and databases of the normal brain represent the logical use of digital and clinical data about brain structure and function in health and disease in the mod- ern era. The complexity of the human brain mitigates against the continued use of traditional methods where narrative reports are published in journals which must then be laboriously collected and reviewed. An emerging approach, that is now well characterized in the literature (see Mazziotta, 2001, 2001a for review), is to develop probabilistic, digital atlases and databases of the human brain where such information can be stored for both nor- mal individuals and patients with neurological disorders. Using four dimensions as the framework for such atlases (three in space and one in time [age]), information from in vivo imaging studies, post mortem data sets, as well as clinical and genetic information, can all be referenced to a particular brain location at a given point in the human lifespan. Ultimately, all clinical data could be organized in this fashion. This formidable task is far from being realized at the present time, but through research studies in normal subjects and more limited examples in patients, such approaches are taking hold and pro- vide the opportunity to produce previously unavailable insights into structure-function relationships in the nor- mal brain and in the course of neurological disorders in specific patient populations. Combining information about structure and function will be a mainstay of brain mapping strategies in the years to come. Population studies from large numbers of subjects provide information about the anatomical loca- tions and their variance for macroscopic cerebral struc- tures including gyri, sulci, the size, shape, and position of deep nuclei as well as white matter tracts (Mazziotta et al. , 1995, 2001, 2001a; Steinmetz et al. , 1991; Paus et al. , 1996, 1996a; Penhume et al. , 1996; Gesch- wind and Levitsky, 1968; Ono et al. , 1990; Talairach and Tournoux, 1988; Thompson et al. , 1998). Similar popu- lation data sets have been (Dumoulin et al. , 2000) and will be obtained using functional techniques to provide estimates of functional anatomy in large segments of the population. Strategies for the automated identification of micro- scopic cyto- and chemoarchitectural data from signifi- cant numbers of post mortem human specimens will provide probability estimates for these variables at a microscopic level (Clark and Miklossy, 1990; Amunts et al. , 1998, 2000; Rademacher et al. , 1992, 1993; Geyer et al. , 2000; Hayes and Lewis, 1995), an issue that has been discussed for the past century (Brodmann, 1909; Bailey and von Bonin, 1951). By combining structural and functional data sets at microscopic and macroscopic What Functional Brain Imaging Will Mean for Neurology 473 Ch29.qxd 9/1/04 6:56 AM Page 473"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"levels (Bodegård, 2000), it will be possible to understand where information about variance in these parameters is quantified, and what the important structure-function relationships in the brain actually are for the first time in large populations. For example, is there concordance or discordance between cytoarchitectural zones and major gyri and sulci in the human brain? Do chemoarchitec- tural zones, populated by transmitter-specific neurons, correspond to cytoarchitectural regions? Do functional activation sites in the brain correspond more closely to macroscopic anatomy such as gyri and sulci, or are they better aligned with cytoarchitectural or chemoarchitec- tural regions? If it turns out that functional brain responses are best correlated with cytoarchitectural or chemoarchitectural regions, standardized functional tasks may be used as surrogate markers of these more difficult to obtain and costly microscopic assays (Mazziotta et al. , 2001, 2001a). This information will also have practical importance with regard to clinical questions. For example, if one can develop a probabilistic distribution for functional activa- tions of key sites in the brain, the targeting of therapeutic lesions or for locating the placement site of stimulation electrodes (e.g., subthalamic electrodes in patients with Parkinson’s disease) will be greatly facilitated and poten- tially more therapeutically efficacious. The same type of information would be useful in presurgical planning for patients who are under consideration for surgical ther- apy of resectable cerebral lesions such as tumors or epileptic foci. Understanding the gross anatomical distribution of white matter tracts will be similarly important. The advent of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (Basser et al. , 1996; Conturo et al. , 1999; Pierpaoli et al. , 1996; Stieltjes et al. , 2001) has already provided the opportunity to see the position and direction of large bundles of nerve fibers and their myelin sheaths in human subjects (Figure 29.1; see also the Color Plate section), a topic that has languished for most of the last century (Flechsig, 1920). By collecting such data in large popula- tions, probabilistic estimates of the location and variance of fiber tracts can be developed. By evaluating changes in these tracts during maturation, development (Paus et al. , 2001), and aging, it may be possible to get a better sense of how the brain responds to these natural events and the implications associated with them. This will further enhance the interpretation of activation studies per- formed to monitor changes in the responses of gray mat- ter regions throughout the human age range. While less attention has been paid to white matter anatomy and function by the brain mapping community, a resurgence of interest in this area will certainly emerge as the new techniques discussed previously mature and because questions will arise relevant to brain maturation and aging that rely heavily on information of this sort. Already, MRI has provided an indirect measure of myelinization (Paus et al. , 2001) that can provide impor- tant new insights into the relationship between gray and white matter maturation during the human life span. Finally, a detailed understanding of white matter anatomy will be critical in preoperative and intraopera- tive surgical planning (Kettenbach et al. , 1999) where disruption of a critical white matter connection is undoubtedly as detrimental to the patient as the resec- tion of the gray matter sites of origin or targets for specific functional systems. Multimodality Imaging in Disease Individual imaging modalities provide a unique per- spective on brain structure and function. Taken alone, each perspective provides a unique and important insight into cerebral organization and its alteration in disease states. When methods are combined, disadvantages of one technique can be supplemented by advantages of another. Complimentary aspects of multiple techniques provide an integrative view of brain structure and func- tion that is greater than the sum of the parts. For exam- ple, PET and MRI can provide images of brain function with relatively high spatial resolution (i.e., 10-75 mm 3 ) but have limitations with regard to temporal resolution (i.e., seconds to minutes). Combining information about temporal events from techniques with high temporal res- olution (e.g., electroencephalography [EEG], magnetoen- cephalography [MEG]) but which have relatively low spatial resolution can result in the complementary inte- gration of such methods with an improved overall per- spective on the spatial and temporal function of the brain in a given state. By directly stimulating the brain with a magnetic field (transcranial magnetic stimulation [TMS]) and combining the effects measured using this technique with passive “observation” of intrinsic brain activity during behavioral tasks, maps of structure, function, and connectivity can be combined to evaluate physiology in the normal brain and pathophysiology in patients with neurological disorders. Certain prerequisites are required for such studies to stand up to rigorous scientific scrutiny. The alignment and registration of data sets from multiple tomographic modalities is now a reality (Ashburner and Friston, 1997; Woods et al. , 1992, 1993, 1998). Such approaches make it possible to integrate information in the same subject from data sets acquired with different tomographic tech- niques (e.g., CT, PET, MRI, fMRI). They can also be used for averaging data in the same subject from the same modality (e.g., serial MRI studies in patients with degen- erative diseases or brain tumors to measure rates of change in atrophy or tumor growth). 474 What Functional Brain Imaging Will Mean for Neurology Ch29.qxd 9/1/04 6:56 AM Page 474"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"One example of between modality data integration has been with the use of fMRI, EEG, and MEG data sets (Ahlfors et al. , 1999; Bonmassar et al. , 2001). When applied in the same subject using the same behavioral paradigm, fMRI provides useful information on func- tional localization with good spatial resolution (~3-4 mm in plane) but relatively low temporal resolution. MEG provides the opposite; that is, high temporal resolution with relative low spatial resolution. The integration of the two techniques produces a combined data set that has both high spatial and temporal resolution. Nevertheless, this type of strategy is not without its pitfalls. The source of the fMRI signal results from relative hemodynamic changes in perfusion associated with increased neuronal activity resulting from the net increase (or decrease) in cell firing in large numbers of cells over an integrated time frame. The MEG data results from synchronous firing of cells, of sufficient number to be detected by surface SQUID devices in a reliable fashion. Thus, the two signal sources are not identical and using one (i.e., MEG) to provide temporal information for the other (i.e., fMRI) where spatial resolution is excellent, may lead to erroneous interpretations. Various strategies are now underway to determine the weighting factors that each should use for selecting the sites and timing of events; for example, the specific relationship between cellular elec- trophysiology and fMRI responses (Logothetis et al. , 2001). If successful, the integrated use of both tech- niques may result in composite data sets that have improved quality over either of the two individually. fMRI has also been integrated with EEG data for two purposes. In the first, the two methods have been used in an analogous fashion to the fMRI-MEG data sets dis- cussed above, namely, to provide composite high spatial What Functional Brain Imaging Will Mean for Neurology 475 FIGURE 29.1 Human white matter anatomy. It is possible to identify white matter bundles in vivo in the human brain using DTI MRI. Such studies take advantage of the fact that diffusion of water molecules is compartmen- talized within the CNS. As such, this diffusion is not isotropic. The anisotropic movement of water is most obvi- ous in fiber bundles before the fibers branch and reach their targets. As such, major tracks in the brain, such as the cortico-spinal track shown in this image, can be quite clearly identified in individuals. When populations of normal subjects are imaged in this fashion, probabilistic estimates for the location of specific fiber bundles can be determined for the population in general and may be of value in understanding the variance of these structures in the human brain. In a given individual, such studies may be helpful in presurgical planning to avoid disconnection syndromes associated with the inadvertent resections of part or all of these tracks. Courtesy of A.

Clinically, fMRI-EEG integration has been used to identify pathologic electrophysiological events and their site of origin. In patients with epilepsy, focal “spikes” occur in the EEG record as subclinical manifestations of the propensity to have clinical seizures. Spike localization is an important aspect of epilepsy diagnostics and the selection of appropriate therapy. The poor spatial resolu- tion of scalp EEG, however, can often make such localiza- tion quite difficult. In the mid-1990s, it was shown that it was possible, at 1.5T (Ives et al. , 1993; Detre et al. , 1995), to monitor the timing and location of epileptic spikes in fMRI-EEG data sets. Nevertheless, artifacts produced by the radio frequency signals from the fMRI data acquisi- tion contaminated the EEG and movement of electrode wires in the MRI’s magnetic field, caused by voluntary subject movement or the ballistocardiogram, resulted in fMRI artifacts. Since then, many of these problems have been solved or minimized. In fact, it is now possible to per- form “spike mapping” using combined fMRI and EEG in MRI units that function at higher fields (e.g., 3T) (Goldman et al. , 2001; Lemieux et al. , 2001). This type of integrated strategy should be very useful in diagnostic applications relevant to patients with epilepsy or in studies of normal subjects where fMRI–event-related potentials (ERPs) are of interest (Bonmassar et al. , 2001). One may also use a combination of imaging tech- niques to examine neuronal connectivity (Fox et al. , 1997; Paus et al. , 1997). Three techniques are typically combined. Consider the following example: a healthy subject performs a motor task during an fMRI study to identify the hand area of the motor cortex. Three- dimensional images are reconstructed demonstrating the location of that functional area in that subject’s brain. The subject is then positioned in a PET device and a TMS stimulator is targeted, using frameless stereotaxy, to the coordinates of the subject’s hand area of the motor cortex. At the time of injection of the PET blood flow tracer, the TMS device is fired, artificially activating the hand area of the motor cortex, thereby causing it to appear on the functional image. Because this activation will also be propagated orthodromically and antidromi- cally, both inputs and outputs from that subject’s motor cortex will also increase their relative perfusion and facil- itate depiction on the PET image. The strategy allows for the identification of regions in the brain that are func- tionally connected through the combination of these three brain-mapping methods. By performing such stud- ies in large numbers of subjects and in many brain loca- tions, considerable data can be added to probabilistic atlases, providing the important attribute of connectivity to maps of brain structure and function. Such methods can be used in conjunction with anatomical connection data derived from diffusion MRI techniques (Conturo et al. , 1999; Stieltjes et al. , 2001). Furthermore, these methods can be compared with functional connectivity maps (Friston et al. , 1993; Hyde et al. , 1995) to deter- mine the relationship between anatomical and functional connectivity within the human brain. Connectivity may prove to be one of the most valu- able, interesting and, currently, least addressed issue of functional neuroanatomy. Taken together, information derived from effective, anatomical and other forms of connectivity (e.g., microscopic techniques in post mortem specimens) will be valuable, if not critical, com- ponents in developing better theoretical frameworks for understanding cerebral organization and primary or high level mental processes. Preoperative and intraoperative mapping for surgical procedures is another area ripe for integration from mul- tiple modalities. Consider a patient with a brain tumor near language areas in the dominant hemisphere. Structural imaging with MRI would provide information about basic brain anatomy as well as the size, position and distortions induced by the tumor. Functional imag- ing provides information about critical cortical and sub- cortical graygray matter areas that should be avoided to preserve language function adjacent to the tumor itself. DTI with MRI can provide an estimate of deep white matter structures, which should also be avoided in the course of the surgical resection. High density EEG and/or MEG could provide “spike maps” to indicate whether cortical regions near the tumor were epilepto- genic and should also be considered for resection. Repetitive TMS stimulation in critical areas adjacent to the tumor could theoretically be used to produce a “vir- tual lesion” demonstrating the types and degree of deficits that the patient might experience if normal corti- cal regions were resected inadvertently. TMS could also be used to map functional connections of language areas that pass through white matter structures near or adja- cent to the tumor itself. These combined data sets could be brought to the operating room, after their pre-operative acquisition, and displayed with a surgical navigation sys- tem that would register with probes on the surface of, or deep within the brain to aid in the execution of the pro- cedure. Intraoperative MRI or optical imaging (Toga et al. , 1995) could then be used to update functional maps as the brain shape changed in the course of resec- tion as a result of therapeutic maneuvers (e.g., osmotic dehydration) or local pathophysiological effects (e.g., local edema). Such a suite of tools would provide the neurosurgeon with a vastly increased wealth of informa- tion about an individual patient and a greater margin of safety for performing surgical resections in or near critical brain structures. 476 What Functional Brain Imaging Will Mean for Neurology Ch29.qxd 9/1/04 6:56 AM Page 476"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"PROSPECTS FOR DIAGNOSIS Experience in the past 15 years has suggested that functional imaging is more likely to provide information about pathogenesis, or of importance to monitoring treatment than specifically for diagnostic purposes. The recent computerized morphometric techniques, however, appear to be particularly sensitive to the detection of dif- fuse cerebral change as found in dementias and degener- ative diseases. The accuracy with which the component tissues of the brain can be segmented also provides the possibility that specific measurements of damage to the white matter could improve assessment of disease load in demyelinating diseases. Patterns of gray matter atrophy differ between different types of primary dementia. Combinations of gray and white matter atrophy may have even more specific diagnostic characteristics. The ability to record the EEG simultaneously with MRI imaging has already been exploited to detect cortical ectopia and relate spiking activity to sites of cortical dys- genesis. The opportunities for improved diagnosis with multi-modality imaging appear to be great. Functional Disease The distinction between functional and psychiatric disease is a difficult one. There have been recent studies, mostly case studies to date, that have tackled syn- dromes that primarily represent somatization disorders. Examples of these include hysteria and malingering. For the purposes of this chapter, paroxysmal headaches, par- ticularly migraine and its variants, are also grouped under functional disorders because, until the functional and structural imaging studies of the late 1990s, little advance had been made in the understanding of the ori- gin of these disorders, despite considerable advances in therapeutics. Functional imaging will be informative in somatiza- tion disorders such as hysteria when plausible and real- istic cognitive models of these syndromes can be formulated. At that stage, it will be possible to decom- pose the cognitive components and attempt to measure their integrity in the brains of patients. Attempts have been made to image patients with hysterical paralysis (Halligan et al. , 2000). Obvious difficulties arise in trying to compare cortical activity that might be attributed to intended movement, attention to movement, or mecha- nisms of movement inhibition, in situations where a limb cannot actually be moved. A number of ingenious ways of overcoming this sort of problem have been described, including examining patients and normal volunteers in states of hypnosis. In hypnotized subjects, motor states can be induced that correspond to intent to deceive (malingering) or paralysis. Such studies are generating results that implicate interactions between pre-frontal, pre-motor, and motor executive regions, and provide a unique way forward in the diagnosis of these disorders. In the headache syndromes, the way forward has been clearer. Capturing patients during an aura or in the phase of a paroxysmal headache has been difficult, but case studies of immense importance have been described (May et al. , 2000; Woods et al. , 1994). Alternative strate- gies include scanning during the induction of pain by agents such as subcutaneous capsaicin or with resolution of pain following effective treatments (for example, the imidazoles). The role of the brainstem in generating migrainous paroxysmal headaches has been indicated by a number of studies (Weiller et al. , 1995), leading to the suggestion that it is a primarily neurological disease with secondary effects on the vascular system (May et al. , 1999). More intriguingly, one as yet unconfirmed study suggests that there are structural abnormalities that colo- calize with functional abnormalities in unilateral cluster headaches (May et al. , 1999a). Independent therapeutic attempts using deep brain stimulation of the hypothala- mic area, implicated by structural and functional results in chronic sufferers from cluster headache that are resist- ant to all forms of noninvasive therapy, have proved anecdotally successful (Leone et al. , 2001). The indica- tion of therapeutic site or target by functional and struc- tural studies such as these is promising for those interested in the treatment of functional disorders. Another example relates to people suffering from chronic pain. Studies in this area have concentrated on trying to determine whether pain processing is normal in such patients or is in some way pathological. This hypothesis is supported by some evidence, with indica- tions that the anterior cingulate centered medial pain sys- tem shows abnormal processing of acute painful stimuli in patients. The concept of pathological processing of normal stimuli, without corresponding structural change, is an important one. This type of result suggests the possibility of identifying targets for pharmaco- logical or stereotactic surgery in people suffering from sometimes intensely disabling functional syndromes. Degenerative Disease Imaging studies have become a mainstay for diagnos- ing a wide range of central nervous system disorders. The list is long and well-known to practicing clinicians. Most studies focus on structural imaging using MRI, but the prospects are ripe for functional diagnoses using PET, fMRI, and SPECT. An important aspect of the use of functional imaging to diagnose degenerative disorders is that since these disorders have an underlying biochemical basis, functional imaging demonstrates abnormalities earlier, and with more sensitivity, than structural What Functional Brain Imaging Will Mean for Neurology 477 Ch29.qxd 9/1/04 6:56 AM Page 477"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"imaging. The latter ultimately shows the hallmark of almost all degenerative diseases, namely cerebral atrophy, whether focal or generalized. Such functional changes can also precede clinical signs and symptoms of these disorders. For example, in Huntington’s disease, func- tional changes in glucose metabolism of the caudate nucleus occur years before the onset of signs and symp- toms in patient populations (Mazziotta et al. , 1987; Grafton et al. , 1990). This is followed by structural changes that can be measured with MRI as atrophy of the caudate nuclei. As such, presymptomatic individuals (i.e., those that have the pathologic genotype) could be monitored for some period of time with functional imag- ing, a window opportune for exploring the effects of experimental therapies. Because such presymptomatic individuals are, by definition, normal, there are no clini- cal measures by which to determine the efficacy of a given experimental treatment for them. Functional imag- ing can provide noninvasive, objective, and quantifiable information relevant to the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of the experimental treatment. Interestingly, recent VBM studies are now also showing anatomical changes in patients with presymptomatic Huntington’s disease (Thieben et al. , 2002). The same strategy has been developed and used for Alzheimer’s disease. It was noted, early in the application of PET technology, that metabolism was reduced in the parietal and superior temporal neocortical regions in patients with signs and symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease (Frackowiak et al. , 1981). Subsequently, using the same strategies that were discussed above for Huntington’s dis- ease, Small et al. (1995) demonstrated that such early changes were also demonstrable in individuals at increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease, by virtue of the fact that they had the genotype ApoE 4. Subsequent studies demonstrated that there was a significant decline in glucose metabolism in parietal, temporal, and cingu- late cortices in these high risk, presymptomatic indi- viduals when compared to control subjects, again demonstrating an avenue for evaluating experimental therapies in this patient population (Small et al. , 2000). With fMRI, Bookheimer et al. (2000) used a similar experimental design in high-risk individuals (ApoE 4 genotype) who were presymptomatic for Alzheimer’s dis- ease. Reiman et al. (2001) obtained similar results. Thus, an easily available technique, fMRI, could be used to screen individuals for functional abnormalities as well as to monitor experimental therapies for such conditions. Differential patterns of abnormal metabolism and atro- phy (Rosen et al. , 2002) are already providing highly sen- sitive ways of distinguishing and monitoring, in time, the different forms of dementia that are being recog- nized and described (Alzheimer’s, frontotemporal, semantic, etc.) The impact of such approaches cannot be underesti- mated given the large number of individuals at risk for degenerative disorders of the brain and the limited armamentarium of medical therapeutics available to treat them. As new therapeutic agents are brought into the experimental clinical domain from basic neuroscien- tific explorations, a vital need for sensitive, presympto- matic monitoring of the therapeutic effects of such agents would be immediately realized and required. In the area of diagnosis, similar pressures and requirements will continue to increase as the magnitude of these global neurological health problems outpaces our capacity to treat such patients. Paroxysmal Disease Both structural and functional imaging can be used to diagnose paroxysmal disorders of the brain as well as to monitor ongoing cerebrovascular pathophysiology in patients with ischemic brain injury. The concept of “spike mapping” has previously been discussed but structural brain imaging may also provide useful insights into the site of epileptogenic lesions in patients with seizure disorders. Advanced analysis strategies for morphometric evalu- ation of brain structure have resulted in the probabilistic atlases noted above, that quantify variance within the human population (Mazziotta et al. , 1995, 2001, 2001a). Subpopulations drawn from these larger data sets can provide comparison populations for smaller groups or individual subjects (Thompson et al. , 1998, 2000). Using such an approach, combined with advanced image seg- mentation analysis strategies, it is possible to find subtle structural abnormalities in the brain. This has also been applied in the clinical environment. For example, small and qualitatively subtle heterotopias that produce focal epilepsy can be missed when conventional MRI studies of brain structure are qualitatively analyzed by neurora- diologists. This is because the variance in cortical thick- ness is large among individuals in the population. Nevertheless, when that variance can be quantified through probabilistic strategies and compared to single individuals, such heterotopias have been identified (Bastos et al. , 1999) because they fall outside of the con- fidence limits for the normal variance of the brain in a given cortical region. In some cases, patients have had as many as three or four qualitative MRI studies demon- strating no abnormality even when the EEG focus of seizures had been identified and could be used by the radiologist to bias their qualitative examination of struc- tural MRI studies for abnormalities. Quantitative tech- niques can identify these “missed” heterotopias (Bastos et al. , 1999), in some cases leading to surgical resection of the cortical zones and improvement or resolution of a patient’s seizure disorder. 478 What Functional Brain Imaging Will Mean for Neurology Ch29.qxd 9/1/04 6:56 AM Page 478"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"In the area of ischemic brain disease, there is a criti- cal need to develop sensitive indications of perfusion, metabolism, and prognosis for tissue at jeopardy from ischemic injury. This has led to the quest to find “tissue clocks” for ischemic brain injury (Koroshetz et al. , 1997). MRI and PET studies have already provided new insights into the hemodynamic and metabolic events that result in cerebral ischemia and infarction (Derdeyn et al. , 1999; Firlik et al. , 1998; Lutsep et al. , 1997; Marchal et al. , 1993; Moseley et al. , 1990; Gilman, 1998; Schlaug et al. , 1999). However, patients who arrive at hospitals with new ischemic events must be screened for the duration of time between the onset of an event and potential therapy (e.g., tPA). Currently, a 3-hour window is allowable and predictive of efficacious intervention using this approach (Hacke et al. , 1995; Katzan et al. , 2000; tTP Stroke Study Group, 1995). While this seems straightforward, the determination of this time interval is often difficult and fraught with errors. For example, a patient may awaken with a new deficit and be unable to determine when it actually occurred. The patient may be unable to report the information personally (e.g., secondary to aphasia) and family members may not have a clear or accurate estimate of when a given patient’s symptoms began. Finally, the therapeutic window for the use of agents such as tPA has been determined through clinical trials where an arbitrary time frame was selected and effi- cacy determined in a binary fashion (i.e., it worked or it didn’t). It may be that there are selected patients for which a time window determined by these strategies is inappropriate, at either end of the temporal spectrum. For all these reasons, it is highly desirable that a tissue clock (Baird and Warach, 1998; Kidwell et al. , 2000; Koroshetz et al. , 1997; Staroselskaya et al. , 2001) be developed using objective and noninvasive tools. It is conceivable that some combination of perfusion, diffu- sion, and other MRI-based techniques may, in aggregate, provide such an estimate of tissue viability and a window of therapeutic intervention. It is predicted that rigorous, multipulse sequence evaluations of such patients with MRI methods will result in just such a tissue clock, thereby enhancing the application of such therapies to a wider range of patients and providing a better under- standing of why and when such methods are efficacious. In addition, functional imaging of the cortex following infarction may provide improved estimates of cortical injury that account for plastic reorganization and a bet- ter understanding of the recovery process (Crafton et al. , 2003; Rossini, et al. , 2003). Psychiatric Disease There are many who still think that functional imag- ing of the brain will be of greatest use to the analysis of psychiatric disorders. It is true that in the early days of FDG-based PET scanning, many studies showing pat- terns of abnormality in resting brains of people with major syndromes such as schizophrenia, obsessive- compulsive disorder, and depression appeared (see Mayberg, 2000, for review). What has been disappointing is that the resting pattern has not provided information that is more sensitive for diagnostic purposes than expert clinical examination and analysis. Nevertheless, it was of some interest that patients with depression tended to show generalized hypofunction that would reverse on anti-depressive treatment, patients with obsessive com- pulsive disorders showed orbital frontal abnormalities that again reversed, while patients with schizophrenia in general showed abnormalities of dorsolateral prefrontal function, although at times this was described as a hypofunction and others reported hyperactivity. More recently, the approach taken has been to analyze the symptoms that characterize these disorders. For example, relative poverty of spontaneous action is a characteristic of retarded depression, schizophrenia with negative features, as well as some neurodegenerative dis- orders such as Parkinson’s disease. The approach has been to examine resting state abnormalities across diag- nostic categories. For example, patients with relative hypokinesia, from whatever cause, are compared to those with normal spontaneous activity. The delineation of a dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate system that is hypofunctional in hypoactive patients has been clearly demonstrated. This observation generated a hypothesis that these parts of the frontal lobes are in some way responsible for the intention to act in a given circumstance, in a manner that is different to stimulus- response activity. This hypothesis was tested in normal volunteers and found to be correct. In addition, it was determined that the frontal areas interacted with post- central motor and sensory areas relevant to the activity undertaken. Thus, spontaneous, as opposed to reactive, movement of the hand normally results in activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingu- late cortex with hypoactivity of the hand area of the motor cortex. Reflex activity results in activation of the hand area of the motor cortex. On the other hand, speech and articulation result in hypoactivation of the face area and the auditory cortex during self-initiated speech, in addition to the hyperactivity of dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex. The description of a normal cortical system, which includes two components, a frontal supra-modal system and a post-central modality specific area, gives a basis for understanding what happens in hypokinetic patients. Schizophrenic patients with hypokinesia have hypoac- tivity of the frontal and cingulate cortices with para- doxical hyper-activation of the post central regions.

This example introduces the concept of dysfunctional cerebral systems and how treatment of such a dysfunctional system can be followed by correlation between behavioral modification and normalization of activity patterns in the relevant brain systems. Morphometric analyses of the major psychiatric syn- dromes are still in there infancy. The first use of voxel- based morphometry suggested abnormalities in the medial temporal aspects of the brain in the schizophre- nia (Wright et al. , 1995). Generalized atrophy and focal changes have been demonstrated. It appears that schizo- phrenia may be too coarse a diagnosis. There is a realistic prospect that phenomenological or genetic stratification of patients combined with differential imaging patterns of atrophy or dysfunction may be a better way to classify psychotic patients in the future; especially for the purposes of early treatment. PHARMACOLOGY AND POST-GENOMICS PET with positron labeled tracers of drugs continues to be a viable method for assessing pharmacokinetics, drug distribution, and dose ranges in human brains. The procedure for making such labeled tracers for human investigative use is burdensome. It is still not clear whether this approach will be more efficient and less costly than conventional ways of carrying out studies to determine these characteristics of potential therapeutic compounds. Since the mapping of the human genome and the beginning of the postgenomic era, a major problem in biology will be the determination of the functions of the proteins coded by the genome. The link between the molecular composition of cells and the system physiology of which they are a part is a difficult one to define. There are pilot studies that suggest functional and structural imaging may contribute to this endeavor in a significant way. Some of these studies are described below. A further use for PET based ligands is in studies of the viability of cells implanted into the brain for therapeutic purposes. The prime example is the demonstration of the viability of fetal mesencephalic cells for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (Lindvall et al. , 1994). It is not yet clear whether such approaches will be easier or more effective than the alternative of challenging the therapeu- tic implant physiologically using BOLD fMRI to deter- mine brain responses. The effectiveness of deep brain stimulation of the sub-thalamic nucleus in Parkinson’s disease appears to be due to a distant influence that the stimulation has on the function of the supplementary motor area and prefrontal cortex. Pharmacodistribution, Pharmacokinetic, and Dose-Ranging Studies Techniques have been developed for measuring the regional cerebral uptake of labeled tracers of receptors, vesicles, and neurotransmitter reuptake sites. Tracers such as PK11195 target specific receptor molecules that are expressed only in certain pathological conditions—in this case, peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites on the surface of activated microglia in inflamed brain tissue— and can be excellent markers of specific pathogenic processes in diseases of interest (Banati, 2002). The uptake of neurotransmitter-related tracers has not proved of great importance in the differential diagnosis of degenerative basal ganglion disease, even though some differential group patterns have been demonstrated. Tracers of specific enzymes have been used in dose ranging studies. For example, monoamine oxidase B activity can be assessed by the kinetics of uptake of car- bon-11–labeled deprenyl. The previous introduction of a novel antagonist at different doses permits an analysis from the images of the differential subsequent capture of the radio-labeled deprenyl and hence calculation of the effectiveness of the new agent as a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme (Bench et al. , 1991; Lammertsma et al. , 1991). Though the principle of this type of dose-ranging study was established some time ago, it has not entered routine practice, largely because it depends on develop- ing an appropriate tracer to test putative drugs. Similar techniques have been developed for measuring the time courses of drug binding to receptors and the kinetics of reversible receptor blockade (Bench et al. , 1993). However, the complexity of such studies and the need for teams of experienced chemists and pharmacologists has meant that these techniques have not been used systematically yet in the development of new drugs. Post-Genomic Studies with Positron Emission Tomography Using Reporter Genes A key area for the use of tracer techniques in human brain mapping experiments will be in the area of moni- toring gene expression in human subjects. The ability to image gene expression in vivo in humans would provide an important link between the disciplines of molecular biology and phenotype assessment. These two rapidly expanding fields would then be joined with a common purpose, namely, the visualization of molecular events that cause disease and interventions, at a molecular level, that can prevent, delay, arrest, or reverse disease progres- sion. All current approaches require tracer techniques. These use radioisotope tracers and imaging methods such as PET, single-photon emission computed tomogra- phy, or non-radioactive contrast agents visible with MRI. 480 What Functional Brain Imaging Will Mean for Neurology Ch29.qxd 9/1/04 6:56 AM Page 480"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"The more general the solution to the problem of tracing such events, the more generalizable and useful the result. The approach is similar to a standard molecular biology experiment, in which a reporter gene and a reporter probe produce a signal that can be visualized in the cell, typically with some type of optical (e.g., fluorescence) change. Two promising approaches have been described. To illustrate the strategy that can be used with PET, consider a situation in which the protein product of an expressed PET reporter gene is an enzyme, such as her- pes simplex virus thymidine kinase, and the PET reporter probe is a fluorine-18–labeled analog of ganciclovir, 18 F-fluorogancyclovir (Phelps, 2000). The strategy works as follows. The PET reporter gene is incorporated into the genome of an adenovirus that is administered to the test subject or animal. Subsequently, 18 F-fluorogancyclovir is injected intravenously. It diffuses into cells and, if there has been no reporter gene expression, it will diffuse back out of cells and will be cleared from circulation by the kidneys. If gene expression has occurred, the 18 F-fluorogancyclovir will be phosphorylated by the reporter gene enzyme and trapped in the cell. One mole- cule of the enzyme can phosphorylate many molecules of the reporter probe, so that there is an amplification effect in this enzyme-mediated approach (Phelps, 2000). Two MRI strategies are under consideration for demonstrating gene expression. In the first, a molecule is created with a gadolinium ion at its center, positioned in such a way that the ion has limited access to water protons and, as such, perturbs the MRI signal minimally. Site- specific placement of a portion of the molecule that can be cleaved by the product of a reporter gene then exposes the gadolinium ion, making it more accessible to water protons and changing the MRI signal at local sites of gene expression. For example, the site-specific placement of a galactopyranocyl ring in the macromolecule can be cleaved by the commonly used reporter gene beta- galactosidase (Louie et al. , 2000). An alternative approach is to create particles composed of DNA and a polylysine molecule modified with a paramagnetic contrast agent such as gadolinium (Louie et al. , 2000). The co-transport of the DNA and MRI contrast agent demonstrates areas of gene expression that can target specific cells in vivo as a marker of this process (Kayyem, 1995). These tools will be extremely useful in both research and clinical settings as gene therapy becomes a reality in the years to come. Linking Structural and Functional Images to Clinical Phenotypes and Genotypes The simultaneous collection of phenotypic informa- tion from brain mapping experiments in the human nervous system with genotype information derived from the analysis of subjects’ DNA will allow for true phenotype-genotype experimentation to flourish in the future. If such studies are performed in large enough populations and include twins (both monozygotic and dizygotic), estimates of heritability for certain traits or disorders should emerge (Mazziotta et al. , 2001, 2001a). There is evidence for this type of evaluation already pres- ent in the literature (Bartley et al. , 1997; Bookheimer et al. , 2000; Egan et al. , 2001; Thompson et al. , 2001). Studies that seek to determine the relationship between phenotype and genotype can use cohorts of twins to understand the contribution of genetics to human behav- ior while controlling for environmental factors with twins that are reared together or apart. Thus, the full gamut of genetic and environmental factors can be put in a frame- work that is manageable and potentially scientifically rig- orous. While the uses of such information are obvious in studies of patients with specific cerebral disorders, par- ticularly those that are inherited, a wide range of previ- ously unanswered, or even considered, questions will emerge in the realm of basic neuroscience and for the normal human brain. An excellent example of how behavior can be related to imaging phenotypes in genetics is represented by the study of serotonin function and anxiety disorders by Hariri et al. (2002). This work demonstrated the value of having an imaging phenotype with less variance than behavioral phenotypes provide, to identify correlations between genotype and (imaging) phenotype. The basis for this work stems from the fact that basic neuroscience studies have demonstrated that serotonin transporter promoter polymorphisms alter serotonin tr ansporter gene (SLC 6A4) transcription and function. One or two copies of the short (“s”) allele (versus the long “l” allele) result in decreased 5-HTT mRNA production and a 50% reduction in 5-HT uptake, but only slight differences in the incidence of anxiety and affective disorders in human subjects. In this experiment, 28 right-handed subjects were divided into genotype-specific (“s” or “l”) groups matched for age, gender, and mean IQ. BOLD fMRI was used to measure relative cerebral blood flow with visual stimuli comparing emotional expression in faces with simple spatial comparisons (Figure 29.2; see also the Color Plate section). A working memory task was also employed as a second control state. Both genotype groups (“s” and “l”) had bilateral increases in relative cerebral blood flow in the amygdalae, fusiform and infe- rior parietal cortices as well as the frontal eye fields. The responses were larger for the emotional comparison task for the “s” versus the “l” group on the right side. There were no group differences noted for working memory tasks or on behavioral measures (e.g., reaction time, etc.). There are also no effects related to gender. These investi- gators concluded that the “s” genotype may act to increase available serotonin at excitatory synapses in the What Functional Brain Imaging Will Mean for Neurology 481 Ch29.qxd 9/1/04 6:56 AM Page 481"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"amygdala because of relatively decreased transporter expression and function leading to increased neuronal activity, as measured by enhanced relative cerebral blood flow. This is an example of how genotype-phenotype corre- lations can be performed in situations where behavioral aspects of the comparison have a high variance and indi- vidual inconsistencies. Nevertheless, if there is an anatomical substrate for the behavior in question, in this case the amygdala, imaging studies may prove to be a good way to quantify these relationships by providing an imaging phenotype to relate to genotype. It is most likely that similar comparisons will be performed in a wide range of neurological diseases as well as to assess normal brain function as it relates to inherited factors that can be correlated with genotype. Another example is the deletion mapping strategy used to define areas of the X chromosome in which there are genes that determine the development of specific regions of the brain by examining patients with Turner’s and partial Turner’s syndromes (Good et al. , 2003). Patients with Turner’s syndrome have subtle behavioral and cognitive abnormalities. Patients with partial Turner’s syndrome have partial deletions of the short 482 What Functional Brain Imaging Will Mean for Neurology 5 4 3 2 1 0 T value First Cohort Amygdala Response: “s” Group > “I” Group STIMULUS CONTROL A B Second Cohort FIGURE 29.2 Imaging phenotype and genotype related to behavior. Human behavior is quite variable and may fluctuate from day to day. This is particularly true of emotional states. Thus, when a specific genotype was hypoth- esized to be associated with different degrees of serotonin reuptake it was thought that there would be a good cor- relation with anxiety and affective disorders. This was only found to a very limited degree and its significance was questioned. It had been known from basic neuroscience research that the serotonin (5-HT) reuptake transport (5- HTT) promoter could affect serotonin reuptake and that this promoter had two alleles. The short “s” allele would result in less 5-HT reuptake while the long “l” allele would produce normal 5-HT reuptake (see text for details). A: Emotional and spatial stimuli shown to subjects segregated by genotype (“s” or “l” alleles) but matched for age, gender and mean IQ. Subjects were asked to match the emotional expression of the face (left) in the top row with one of the two faces in the bottom row. In the control stimulus (right), the orientation of an ellipse (top row) was to be matched with the orientation of one of the two ellipses in the bottom row. B: It was demonstrated that the magnitude and spatial extent of the relative cerebral blood flow response of the right amygdala was greater in the group having the “s” allele (first cohort) relative to the “l” allele (second cohort).

This suggested an imaging strat- egy using voxel-based morphometry that involved exam- ining structural differences in patients and normal volunteers and correlating these with chromosome X sta- tus. Focal abnormalities with excess gray matter volume in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortices were found. Analysis of the patients with partial Turner’s syndrome indicated that a critical region of the short arm of the X chromosome contained a gene or genes that influenced the development of these two areas. Patients who retained this critical region showed no abnormalities of brain structure. Patients who lost the critical region showed the abnormalities of the full Turner syndrome. The amygdala is known from other studies to be involved in recognition of fear in the faces of others. The mor- phometric result suggested that the patients with partial Turner’s syndrome might have abnormalities detecting fear in the faces of others that correlated with their genetic characterization. The prediction is completely confirmed with behavioral studies. This example of map- ping the function of chromosomal regions using oppor- tunities provided by genetic diseases provides tantalizing opportunities for the future. There are studies of individuals from families with Huntington’s disease (see previous discussion) who are normal but nevertheless demonstrate atrophy of caudate nucleus on structural MRI that correlates with their genetic status in terms of numbers of CAG codon repeats. This finding raises the possibility of defining endophenotypes that permit much more accurate strati- fication of patients and prediction of their eventual clinical outcome from analysis of brain structure or function. SURROGATE MARKERS OF EFFECTIVENESS OF TREATMENT Classically, the introduction of new treatments for neurological diseases, especially those based on neuro- degeneration require large cohorts of patients studied in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. These studies which are large and expensive often follow equally expen- sive phase 2 proof of principle studies and the whole process can take many years before a drug comes to clinical practice. There is an as yet unproved hope that structural and functional imaging studies will provide What Functional Brain Imaging Will Mean for Neurology 483 FIGURE 29.2 cont’d C: While there was overlap between the groups, there was clear separation of the mean of the fMRI signal response in the amygdala of these two groups as demonstrated in this graph. Such studies demonstrate that phenotype-genotype comparisons can often be better quantified and made more specific when a behavioral phenotype is substituted with a functional imaging parameter, in this case, response to an emotional matching task in the visual modality.

Quite apart from potentially improving the rational choice of dose and dosing schedule, activation studies provide an opportunity to examine the direct effects of a putative treatment on dysfunctional brain systems. The rationale has been described above in relation to the treatment of hypokinesia. A potential drug and its placebo can be regarded as two contexts within which a particular sys- tem operates. A comparison of the activity within this brain system under the two contexts will reveal how, and to what extent, an agent acts. It is important to be clear that one is not examining the specific site of action of the putative drug but its overall effectiveness. Thus a drug may act on a particular set of receptors and the neurons expressing those receptors may then have downstream effects on other neurons which themselves alter interac- tions between other sets of neurons. This approach is fundamentally different to using a specific tracer of the receptor to determine its ability to bind and block that receptor specifically. Structural and Functional Images as Surrogate Markers of Disease Progression Both structural and functional imaging studies have the potential to produce a wide range of surrogate markers that allow for the objective, quantifiable and noninvasive monitoring of disease progression in both symptomatic and presymptomatic individuals. Given the magnitude of neurological disease and its economic impact, such surrogate markers will be vital in the future design of experimental clinical trials, in which both phar- macological and behavioral interventions are explored. The range of possible applications spans the gamut from drug trials in degenerative disease and stroke to strategies for effective optimization of neural plasticity in patients with acute brain injury following stroke or trauma. Already, examples of such studies are becoming more commonplace in the neuroscientific, clinical, and neu- roimaging literature. Both pharmaceutical corporations as well as the biotechnology industry are interested in using such strategies to make such explorations more effective in terms of cost and time. Experimental drug trials are both important and extremely expensive. Any approach that can be used to make such trials more economical and shorter in dura- tion will certainly be adopted. Through the combined use of probabilistic normal and disease-specific atlases, it may be possible to use data from brain mapping methods to serve as surrogate markers in clinical trials designed to evaluate a pharmacological or behavioral therapy (Figure 29.3; see also the Color Plate section). Consider the following example: a new experimental drug has been developed for the treatment of relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis. It is clinically important to compare the efficacy of this drug relative to conven- tional treatment and to the natural course of the disease. Three groups of subjects are selected, one receiving the experimental drug, one on conventional therapy, and one receiving a placebo. Subjects are serially studied using gadolinium-enhancing lesions as a surrogate marker of disease burden (Weiner et al. , 2000). A duration is deter- mined for the trial, with equally spaced MRI evaluations both before and after the onset of the proposed interven- tions. Probabilistic atlases are developed from the longi- tudinal studies in each subject for all three groups. The placebo group provides an estimate of the natural history of disease burden during the interval. The conventional therapy atlas can be used to show the impact of tradi- tional approaches on the natural course of the disease. Lastly, the experimental therapeutic group is compared with the other two to determine, in an objective, nonin- vasive, and quantifiable manner, the relative efficacy of the proposed new therapy relative to the natural course of the disease and conventional treatments. This approach should be extremely appealing because it has the potential to make clinical trials less expensive and more objective. Furthermore, because the data can be continually reanalyzed and used in comparisons with 484 What Functional Brain Imaging Will Mean for Neurology FIGURE 29.3 Probabilistic atlas of multiple sclerosis. This image is produced from 460 patients with multiple sclerosis derived from 5800 individual pulse sequences. The green areas demonstrate the proba- bilistic location of the actual MS plaques in the population referenced to the human ventricular system (red). This strategy gives a composite view of overall disease burden across a large population. Consider its use in a clinical trial where these patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups that included placebo, conventional therapy and experimental therapy. By observing the group for some period and obtaining serial images, an automated, quantifiable, and objective measure of the relative effect of experimental therapy versus conven- tional therapy and the natural history of the disease could be obtained using MRI lesions as a surrogate marker of disease burden. Such strate- gies should lead to more efficient and cost-effective clinical trials. Courtesy of Zijdenbos, Evans and colleagues, Montreal Neurologic Institute, Montreal, Canada.

This fur- ther enhances the value of the funds spent to perform such studies. Already examples of this type of work have been obtained in patients with multiple sclerosis (Evans et al. , 1997; Kamber et al. , 1992, 1995; Zijdenbos et al. , 1996) (see Figure 29.3) and have been purposed for patients with Alzheimer’s disease (Bookheimer et al. , 2000). A critical factor in the utilization of this strategy is that there is a biologically significant and important marker of disease burden that can be estimated using the brain mapping method at hand. Without a strong corre- lation between the surrogate marker and the biological significance of the disease process, it would be unwise and ineffective to base the efficacy of a given therapeutic strategy on the surrogate marker derived from brain- mapping methods (Weiner et al. , 2000). It is quite likely that such surrogate markers will be validated and can serve as an important means by which to improve the efficacy and economics of clinical trials on experimental therapeutics. We have already discussed the possibility of using brain mapping methods, particularly MRI strategies, to develop a tissue clock for the evaluation of patients with acute ischemic injury of the brain. The same approach may be useful in other acute settings such as trauma. In patients with acute head trauma, particularly if it is severe, it is difficult or impossible to determine the ulti- mate outcome and quality of the patient during the first few days following injury. Extraordinary costs and emotional anguish are expended by the family for patients who might otherwise be judged as nonviable. Concomitantly, it is conceivable that treatment is with- held, delayed, or terminated in some individuals who might ultimately have a better-than-expected clinical out- come. If it were possible to reliably determine the prog- nosis for such patients in the acute setting, using one or more brain mapping methods, the net result will be a reduced economic burden to families and healthcare plans, as well as the important and substantial reduction in family anguish over the ambiguity of this type of clin- ical situation. Surrogate markers of prognosis will be an important part of the evaluations of such patients in the future. Serial Measurement of Atrophy in Degenerative Disease The physical world is organized in four dimensions; three in space and one in time. Tomographic brain map- ping techniques produce true three-dimensional data while surface techniques such as EEG and OIS produce two-dimensional surface maps. The ability to combine temporal information with two- or three-dimensional spatial information can result in rate-of-change maps. Most commonly used with three-dimensional structural MRI data, four-dimensional rate-of-change maps have demonstrated cross-sectional and longitudinal changes of the corpus callosum during natural development (Thompson et al. , 2000a) (Figure 29.4A; see also Color Plate section). Similarly, these same strategies have been applied in pathologic conditions to observe the four- dimensional growth of tumors, either as a measure of their natural course or to evaluate selective treatment strategies (Haney et al. , 2001, 2001a). The same approach has been used to monitor tissue loss (i.e., atro- phy) in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (Thompson et al. , 1998, 2000) (Figure 29.4B; see also Color Plate section). It is anticipated that four- dimensional rate-of-change maps will be applied to func- tional information measured during the processes of learning, functional loss in degenerative disease, and recovery of function following acute injury such as trauma and stroke, with and without the applications of neurorehabilitation strategies. Probabilistic atlases based on diseased populations (Thompson et al. , 2000) show enormous promise in advancing our understanding of disease. As imaging studies expand into ever-larger patient populations, pop- ulation-based brain atlases offer a powerful framework to synthesize the results of disparate imaging studies. Disease-specific atlases, for example, are a type of prob- abilistic atlas specialized to represent a particular clinical group (see Thompson et al. , 2000, for a review). A dis- ease-specific atlas of brain in Alzheimer’s disease has recently been generated to reflect the unique anatomy and physiology of this subpopulation (Thompson et al. , 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000; Mega et al. , 1997, 1998, 1999). Based on well-characterized patient groups, this atlas contains thousands of structure models, as well as com- posite maps, average templates, and visualizations of structural variability, asymmetry, and group-specific dif- ferences. It also correlates the structural, metabolic, molecular, and histological hallmarks of the disease (Mega et al. , 1997, 1999, 2000). Additional algorithms use information stored in the atlas to recognize anom- alies and label structures in new patients. Because they retain information on group anatomical variability, the resulting atlases can identify patterns of altered structure or function, and can guide algorithms for knowledge- based image analysis, automated image labeling (Collins et al. , 1994; Pitiot et al. , 2002), tissue classification (Zijdenbos and Dawant, 1994), and functional image analysis (Dinov et al. , 2000). At the core of the atlas is an average MRI data set based on a population of subjects with early dementia (Figure 29.5; see also Color Plate section). Using specialized mathematical approaches for averaging cortical anatomy, the resulting average MRI What Functional Brain Imaging Will Mean for Neurology 485 Ch29.qxd 9/1/04 6:56 AM Page 485"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"template has a well-resolved cortical pattern (Figure 29.5A), with the mean geometry of the patient group (Thompson et al. , 2000). Surfaces for the cortex can include the external hull, the gray-white matter interface, or an average of the full cortical thickness. Figure 29.5A represents the external hull. Resolving the average profile of early gray matter loss in an Alzheimer’s disease population is one such example of application for this type of atlas. It would be ideal, for example, to calibrate the profile of gray matter loss in an individual patient against a normative reference popula- tion, for early diagnosis or for clinical trials. Since indi- vidual variations in cortical patterning complicate the comparison of gray matter profiles across subjects, an elastic matching technique can be used (driven by 84 structures per brain) that elastically deforms each brain into the group mean geometric configuration (Figure 29.5C). By averaging a measure of gray matter across corresponding regions of cortex, these shape differences are factored out. The net reduction in gray matter, in a large patient population relative to controls ( N = 46), can then be plotted as a statistical map in the atlas (Figure 29.5B); Thompson et al. , 2000). This type of analysis uncovers important systematic trends, with an early pro- file of severe gray matter loss detected in temporoparietal cortex, consistent with the early distribution of neuronal loss, metabolic change and perfusion deficits at this stage of Alzheimer’s disease. Finally, this local encoding of information on cortical variation can also be exploited to map abnormal atrophy in an individual patient (Thompson et al. , 1997). Figure 29.5D illustrates the use of a probabilistic atlas to identify a region of abnormal atrophy in the frontal cortex of a dementia patient. Severe abnormality is detected with a color code used to indicate the significance of the abnormality ( red colors ). As expected, corresponding regions in a matched elderly control subject are signaled as normal (Figure 29.5D, right panel ).

If follow- up (longitudinal) images are available from the same subject, the dynamics of brain change can be measured with tensor mapping approaches. These compute an elastic deformation field that reshapes the baseline image to its anatomic configuration at follow-up. From these deformations, maps are generated to visualize local volumetric change, showing local rates of tissue growth or loss (red colors denote fastest growth). A: In children, scanned serially with MRI around the age of puberty, fastest growth is detected in the isthmus of the corpus callosum , which connects the language regions of the two cerebral hemispheres. B: Progression of Alzheimer’s Disease . These maps show the average profile of gray matter loss in a group of 17 patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease. Average percent reductions in the local amount of gray matter are plotted, relative to the average val- ues in a group of 14 healthy age- and gender-matched elderly controls. Over 1.5 years of progressive cognitive decline from mild to moderate dementia, gray matter deficits in these patients spread through the lim- bic system to encompass the majority of the cortex.

These have sought to identify changes in brain structure associated with skills, practice, and repetitive behavior. The first demonstration was in London taxi drivers (Maguire et al. , 2000). They were examined because of their intense use of visuospatial memory. Functional studies in normal humans had demonstrated the importance of the posterior hip- pocampus of the non-dominant hemisphere in tasks requiring visuospatial skills. Activity in this part of the brain correlated with the accuracy with which subjects were able to perform visuospatial tasks. The investigators therefore sought to find evidence of structural change associated with this skill and thus used the taxi drivers whose occupation required that they practice it inten- sively in their daily work. The astonishingly encouraging result was that there is a relative increase in the size of the posterior part of the non-dominant hippocampus in the taxi drivers compared to normal controls, co-locating with the functionally active part. Furthermore, the rela- tive change in size appeared to correlate with number of years spent in the profession, or intensity of use. There What Functional Brain Imaging Will Mean for Neurology 487 FIGURE 29.5 Disease-specific brain atlases. Disease-specific brain atlases reflect the unique anatomy and phys- iology of a clinical population, in this case an Alzheimer’s disease population. Using mathematical strategies to average cortical anatomy across subjects (Thompson et al. , 2000), an average MRI template can be generated for a specific patient group; in this case, nine patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease (A) . The cortical pat- tern indicates clear sulcal widening and atrophic change, especially in temporo-parietal cortices. By averaging a measure of gray matter across corresponding cortical regions, the average profiles of gray matter loss can also be mapped (B) . The net reduction in gray matter, in a large patient population relative to controls (Thompson et al. , 2000), can then be plotted as a statistical map in the atlas ( (B) , upper panel ). This type of analysis uncovers pro- files of early anatomical change in disease. Panel (C) shows an individual’s cortex ( brown mesh ) overlaid on an average cortical model for a group. Differences in cortical patterns are encoded by computing a three-dimensional elastic deformation ( (C) ; pink colors: large deformation) that reconfigures the average cortex into the shape of the individual, matching elements of the gyral pattern exactly. These deformation fields (C) provide detailed informa- tion on individual deviations. These statistical data can be used to detect patterns of abnormal anatomy in new subjects. By encoding variations in gyral patterns and gray matter distribution, algorithms can detect a region of abnormal atrophy in the frontal cortex of a dementia patient (D) . Severe abnormality is detected (red colors) while corresponding regions in a matched elderly control subject are signaled as normal ( (D) , right panel ).

The cause of the structural changes is entirely unknown. It could be due to local changes in neuronal numbers, but equally to changes in glia, synapses, dendritic branching, and the like. Pathological studies will be required to elucidate the cause. In any event, if due to remodeling of the neuronal architecture, such investigations may have considerable implications for those studying the recovery of functions following brain injury. TREATMENT: TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION TO DISTURB FUNCTION AND RESTORE IT We tend to think of brain-mapping methods as pas- sive and observational. They provide information about the structure and function of the brain with varying degrees of invasiveness. Nevertheless, some brain map- ping techniques can also serve a therapeutic role. A good example is repeated stimulation with TMS (rTMS) and its effects on brain function (Epstein et al. , 1996; Pascual- Leone et al. , 1994; Paus et al. , 1997). Single pulse TMS enhances neuronal excitability in local circuits. As such, a single TMS pulse over the motor cortex at sufficient thresh- old will induce a motor contraction in the appropriate con- tralateral musculature of the body. Subclinical thresholds for stimulation will change the peripheral motor-evoked potential. Repeated stimulation with TMS causes a tempo- rary deficit of function and can be used experimentally to remove cortical nodes from complicated networks subserv- ing specific behaviors. In essence, such stimulation pro- duces virtual patients in which normal subjects can have transient focal obliteration of function that can be observed during functional imaging or behaviorally. Daily sessions with rTMS have also been used as a therapeutic intervention. Focal and repeated daily TMS over time may, in fact, have specific therapeutic benefits analogous to the way electroconvulsive shock therapy can be beneficial in a global and less refined strategy for the treatment of intractable depression. rTMS can pro- vide such regional stimulation, optimized to a given sub- ject’s functional neuroanatomy, based on previous functional imaging. Already, this technique has been used as a potential treatment for depression that has proven to be intractable to pharmacological and behavioral therapy (George et al. , 1995, 1999; Levkovitz, 2001; Pascual-Leone et al. , 1996; Post et al. , 1999). It is likely that such strategies of focal, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation will prove successful in the treatments of certain disorders, including depression and some types of focal epilepsies and dystonias. In addition, the use of other energy sources, such as focused ultrasound, may find a place in the treatment of lesions of the brain such as tumors or arteriovenous malformations. CONCLUSION The methods of functional and structural imaging with MRI using computerized methods of image analy- sis provide new and fascinating tools for clinical neuro- scientists. They considerably expand the ability to investigate human brain function in diseased states and under different therapeutic regimes. The method of PET, although reliant on radioactivity, has been largely sup- planted in this field of inquiry. However, it continues to provide a unique way of measuring the distribution, kinetics, and effective dose of putative therapeutic agents. However, there are now new approaches using candidate drugs in pharmacological rather than trace doses to examine their effects on brain function. Functional and structural patterns of abnormality may be of diagnostic or prognostic importance. In dis- eases where there is a significant genetic component, such patterns may turn out to be accurate endophenotypes permitting more precise genetic characterization, espe- cially if patterns of atrophy or dysfunction can be shown to be predictive of particular behavioral abnormalities. This is a program of research for the future. There is no doubt that much fundamental information has been gained in the past 20 years about human cere- bral disease with imaging techniques. This information has been additional to the proven importance of diag- nostic brain scanning. It remains to be seen whether the generalization of specialized image acquisition and analysis techniques will bring advantages in turn to the treatment and prognosis of common cerebral disorders. The catalogue of knowledge obtained to date seems very promising. It may well be that combining the techniques of MRI with methods for measuring rapid changes of brain activity such as EEG and MEG or transient irre- versible impairment of that activity with transient tran- scranial stimulation will provide additional ways of accessing the brain and revealing the mysteries of its organization, health, and disease with even greater precision.

C: Cortical hyperemia ( dark red ) spreading from left to right during CSD. Note that the marked flow increase in cortex and overlying pial vessels was comparable during CSD. A smaller tran- sient rise in MMA blood flow (125% of baseline) was detected at this time.

The relative blood flow in pial vessels and cortex is below baseline at this time (80% of baseline). E: The time course of the change in relative blood flow in MMA ( red line ) and cerebral cortex ( blue line ) demonstrates that CSD induces biphasic blood flow elevations within MMA with an early transient peak (P1) coincident with cor- tical hyperemia. A slower and more sustained increase in MMA blood flow (P2) is observed for approximately 45 minutes. These images clearly demonstrate that CSD-induced trigeminal activation causes long-lasting vasodi- lation selectively in dura mater; oligemia was prominent in cerebral cortex (Bolay et al. , 2002).

A: Microarrays can be used to detect single nucleotide differences (polymorphisms) or identify gene expression pat- terns that predict treatment outcome or adverse affects in patients. B: Oligonucleotide arrays that allow polymorphism detection in a number of candidate genes simultaneously, such as cytochrome p450, that may affect drug metabolism, hence predisposing to treatment failure or adverse affects, will likely soon be widely adopted. Microarrays may also be used to augment diagnostic protocols. In the speculative example shown, mRNA from peripheral blood leukocytes is hybridized onto a cDNA array and the pattern indicates whether the patient is more likely to have Alzheimer’s disease or frontotemporal dementia. Perhaps, more readily adopted into clinical practice will be the use of arrays to classify tumor samples from patients to both aid in diagnosis and pre- dict optimal treatment.

In the case of mouse embryonic stem cells, these cells can grow on feeder layers in leukemia inhibitor factors (LIF) in stage 1. At this stage, various genes can be added or deleted. In the case of Nurr1, it is a positive drive for transcription of dopamine and neuron-related genes. At stage 2, embryoid bodies are formed containing similarly pluripotent cells. In the left panel, as shown by Kim et al. (2002), the embryonic stem cells are brought in five stages to their fetal stage, in which they are then made into a cell suspension and transplanted directly into the Parkinson rat model. Similarly to the default pathway, these embryonic stem cell derived fetal neu- rons will create a functional recovery on amphetamine rotation, as well as a number of spontaneous tasks includ- ing reaching tasks and other evidence of corrected dopamine deficiency. In the upper panel (Bjorklund et al. , 2002), the cells are dissociated at specific cell concentrations and can be placed directly in the brain on low con- centrations and will then, after a few weeks’ time, develop over the species-specific program towards dopaminer- gic and serotonergic neurons. In previous experiments, such neurons would, over time, produce sufficient dopamine to correct the behavioral syndrome of Parkinson’s disease asymmetry, such that the correction can be normalized if sufficient cells are reinnervating the brain compared to sham cells (Bjorklund et al. , 2002).

It is possible to identify white matter bundles in vivo in the human brain using DTI MRI. Such studies take advantage of the fact that diffusion of water molecules is compartmen- talized within the CNS. As such, this diffusion is not isotropic. The anisotropic movement of water is most obvi- ous in fiber bundles before the fibers branch and reach their targets. As such, major tracks in the brain, such as the cortico-spinal track shown in this image, can be quite clearly identified in individuals. When populations of normal subjects are imaged in this fashion, probabilistic estimates for the location of specific fiber bundles can be determined for the population in general and may be of value in understanding the variance of these structures in the human brain. In a given individual, such studies may be helpful in presurgical planning to avoid disconnection syndromes associated with the inadvertent resections of part or all of these tracks. Courtesy of A.

Human behavior is quite variable and may fluctuate from day to day. This is particularly true of emotional states. Thus, when a specific genotype was hypoth- esized to be associated with different degrees of serotonin reuptake it was thought that there would be a good cor- relation with anxiety and affective disorders. This was only found to a very limited degree and its significance was questioned. It had been known from basic neuroscience research that the serotonin (5-HT) reuptake transport (5- HTT) promoter could affect serotonin reuptake and that this promoter had two alleles. The short “s” allele would result in less 5-HT reuptake while the long “l” allele would produce normal 5-HT reuptake (see text for details). A: Emotional and spatial stimuli shown to subjects segregated by genotype (“s” or “l” alleles) but matched for age, gender and mean IQ. Subjects were asked to match the emotional expression of the face (left) in the top row with one of the two faces in the bottom row. In the control stimulus (right), the orientation of an ellipse (top row) was to be matched with the orientation of one of the two ellipses in the bottom row. B: It was demonstrated that the magnitude and spatial extent of the relative cerebral blood flow response of the right amygdala was greater in the group having the “s” allele (first cohort) relative to the “l” allele (second cohort).

This strategy gives a composite view of overall disease burden across a large population. Consider its use in a clinical trial where these patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups that included placebo, conventional therapy and experimental therapy. By observing the group for some period and obtaining serial images, an automated, quantifiable, and objective measure of the relative effect of experimental therapy versus conven- tional therapy and the natural history of the disease could be obtained using MRI lesions as a surrogate marker of disease burden.

From these deformations, maps are generated to visualize local volumetric change, showing local rates of tissue growth or loss (red colors denote fastest growth).

By averaging a measure of gray matter across corresponding cortical regions, the average profiles of gray matter loss can also be mapped (B) .
