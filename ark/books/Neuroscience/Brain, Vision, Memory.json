[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Introduction I am an experimental neuroscientist specializing in brain mechanisms in vision, and a teacher of neuroscience. This introduction explains what led me tempo- rarily to put aside my experiments and neglect my students to write the ªve tales on the history of neuroscience. The ªrst essay began in 1960. I had just completed the experimental work for my Ph.D. thesis, “Some Alterations in Behavior after Frontal Lesions in Monkeys,” at Cambridge University and sat down to write the requisite review of the literature. Six months later I had reached Galen and the second century. At that point, my advisor, Larry Weiskrantz, suggested that, actually, it might be better if I got on with the write-up of my experiments, even though, as I explained to him, Galen had carried out experiments on frontal lobe damage in piglets. So I never included this historical survey in my thesis, and ultimately its review of previous work began with studies in the 1930s. I did show my “up to Galen” manuscript to Joseph Needham. He wrote me an encouraging note, resplendent with Chinese characters, comparing Greek pneuma with Chinese chi. After graduate school I went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a postdoctoral fellow to work with Hans-Lukas Teuber, the charismatic founder of the Department of Psychology, now the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences (Gross, 1994a). I showed him my"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"history manuscript and proposed to continue working on it on the side. Teuber was deeply knowledgeable about the history of biology, almost as deeply as he pretended to be; however, he assured me that I had no time “on the side” and should save history for my retirement days. Despite this advice, when I began to teach what became my perennial undergraduate course on physiological psychology (later renamed cognitive neuroscience), ªrst at Harvard and then at Princeton, I increasingly inserted historical interludes on Vesalius, Willis, and Gall, and other “high points in man’s understanding of his brain.” When some of the premedical students in the course started getting restless at the length of these interludes, I began occasionally teaching a separate course entitled “Ideas on Brain Function from Antiquity to the Twentieth Century.” After the (perceived) success, described below, of my paper on the hippocampus minor, I reached into my “up to Galen” draft and my history of neuroscience lecture notes and began revising and updating them for publica- tion. So when I was asked a few years ago to write an article on visual cortex for the multivolume handbook Cerebral Cortex I seized the opportunity to achieve my thwarted ambition to write a historical introduction starting at the beginning. I began with the ªrst written mention of the brain from the pyramid age, went on to investigations and theories of brain function among Greek physician-philosopher-scientists, and continued through the coma of European science between Galen and the Renaissance. At that point in the article, for obvious practical reasons (my word limit and, certainly, my time were not inªnite), I began to narrow my subject, ªrst to the cerebral cortex and then, by the end of the article, to striate cortex. Chapter 1, “From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel: The Story of Visual Cortex” is a combination of that article (Gross, 1997c) and one I wrote entitled “Aristotle and the Brain” for the Neuroscientist (Gross, 1995). The second essay was inspired by a visit to an exhibit of Leonardo’s anatomical drawings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The rooms were dimly lit and the hushed crowd slowly and reverentially shifted from drawing to drawing of bones, muscles, and viscera, all borrowed from the Introduction x"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Queen’s collection at Windsor Castle. No pamphlets were available nor were there explanations on the walls, not even labels or dates of the drawings. What were we looking at? The drawings of the superªcial musculature seemed accurate enough and certainly beautiful. But the viscera often seemed rather strange, the organs not looking quite right or in the correct places. Of course, I had previously seen his two drawings of brain ventricles, one a purely medieval three circles in the head and the other a realistic, but not quite human ventricular system. I became intrigued as to what Leonardo was illustrating in these famous drawings: the body observed? the body remembered? the body read about? the body rumored? the human body, or animals in human form? Was he illustrating medieval theory, as in the drawing of circular ventricles? Or was he drawing from his own dissection, as in the later ventricular drawing? Hence, eventually, the article on Leonardo’s anatomy. Although it is restricted to a detailed discussion of only a few of Leonardo’s neuroanatomical drawings, I think my comments are applicable to his other biological work. Chapter 2, “Leonardo da Vinci on the Eye and Brain,” was ªrst published in the Neuro- scientist (Gross, 1997b). The third essay derived from the question of whether there can be a theoretical biology or a theoretical biologist. Certainly I see no sign yet of anyone who made signiªcant and lasting theoretical contributions while re- maining only a theorist. All the great theoretical work was done by individuals buried up to their necks if not their eyebrows with empirical data all their busy lives, such as Darwin, Mendel, Bernard, Sherrington, and even Freud. In contrast, those individuals who were only theorists and did little empirical slogging, such as Lotka, Reshevsky, and D’arcy Thompson, have disappeared except as antiquarian curios. Was Emmanuel Swedenborg, the eighteenth-century Swedish mystic, an exception? Solely on the basis of reading the literature of the day, he proposed theories of the functions of the cerebral cortex, of the organization of motor cortex, and of the functions of the pituitary gland that were at least 200 years ahead of everyone else. On the other hand, perhaps he was no exception since, although he often got it right, he never had any impact on biology. Indeed, xi Introduction"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"his work was published and republished in many volumes, but his ideas on the brain continued to go unnoticed until after those that were actually correct were rediscovered independently. Chapter 3, “Emanual Swedenborg: A Neu- roscientist Before His Time,” ªrst published in the Neuroscientist, tells his story (Gross, 1997a). The fourth essay originated when my wife, Greta Berman, bought me a copy of Desmond and Moore’s biography of Darwin soon after it appeared. She had been attracted by a very enthusiastic blurb on the back cover written by a friend of ours. At ªrst I was skeptical, as the book had been rather negatively reviewed in the New York Times Book Review by my old history of science teacher, I. B. Cohen. But as soon as I began to read, I realized what an absolutely splendid book it was, a truly exciting page turner placing Darwin in his social, economic, and scientiªc world. Right in the middle of the book I encountered several references to a lobe of the brain called the hippocampus minor. I do sometimes come across names of unfamiliar brain structures, but never a whole lobe, particularly one that was supposed to be unique to humans. As I looked into more accounts of Victorian biology and the battles over evolution, I realized that although the hippocampus minor was repeatedly mentioned by historians of evolution, it was clear that none of them had any idea of what or where it was. Apparently they had never read or even looked at the pictures in the many articles about the hippocampus minor in midnineteenth-century scientiªc and popular jour- nals. Furthermore, I could ªnd no mention of such a structure in any of my neuroanatomy textbooks (until later when I looked at outdated ones). When I called several of my friends around the country who were among the leading students of the anatomy and physiology of the hippocampus, they too had never heard of the hippocampus minor. Clearly, there was or should have been a ready audience for a paper on this mysterious structure. Hence I researched and wrote “The Hippocampus Minor and Man’s Place in Nature: A Case Study in the Social Construction of Neuroanatomy,” a version of which constitutes chapter 4. It tells what the hippocampus minor is, why it was so important in Introduction xii"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"the controversies that swirled around Darwin, and why it is now so completely forgotten. I could not resist publishing it in a journal called Hippocampus, which is devoted to studies on the anatomy, physiology, and functions of that structure (Gross, 1993a). I liked my article so much that I published a shorter version entitled “Huxley versus Owen: The Hippocampus Minor and Evolution” in the less specialized, more widely read journal, Trends in Neuroscience (Gross, 1993b). Both versions were well received. Indeed, I received more letters of praise for them than I had in response to the over 200 straight science papers I had previously written. I was so reinforced by this reception, as we used to say in B. F. Skinner’s heyday, that over the next few years I submitted for publication several other history of neuroscience articles: versions of them make up the rest of this book. The ªfth essay arose when I was asked to organize a conference on object recognition and the temporal lobes at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in honor of Hans-Lukas Teuber in 1993. After the conference, Pat Goldman- Rakic, the editor of the journal Cerebral Cortex, asked me to edit a special issue based on the meeting. I decided to add a history article of my own to introduce the issue. The article, entitled “How Inferior Temporal Cortex Became a Visual Area,” traced how the visual functions of the temporal cortex were discovered (Gross, 1994b). My colleagues and I had been the ªrst to record from neurons in the temporal cortex (we did so at MIT, under Teuber’s sponsorship), so I made the account of this work at the end of the article very personal and autobiographical. Chapter 5, “Beyond the Striate Cortex: How Large Portions of the Temporal and Parietal Cortex Became Visual Areas,” is derived in part from that article. I expanded its scope to include not only the temporal lobe but also how the parietal lobe became a visual area. Both developments followed from nineteenth-century observations on the effect of temporal and parietal le- sions in monkeys that were forgotten and had to be subsequently rediscovered. Greta Berman, Michael Graziano, and Hillary Rodman read all the essays at least once and gave many helpful comments and much encouragement. xiii Introduction"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Several of the essays were improved by the detailed comments of David Czuchlewski, George Krauthamer, Larry Squire, Derek Gross, Phil Johnson- Laird, Mort Mishkin, Maz Fallah, and Robert Young.

Steve Waxman, founding editor of the Neurosci- entist, encouraged the entire project by publishing two of the essays and signing me up for lots more in the future. Linda Chamberlin of the Princeton Univer- sity Library was tireless in getting me old books and journals from everywhere. Mairi Benson, librarian of the Sherrington Collection in the History of Neuro- science in the Physiological Laboratories, Oxford University, was also very helpful, as was the Wellcome Institute Library in London. I thank Michael Rutter and Katherine Arnoldi, editors at The MIT Press, for their assistance and tolerance, Sarah Jeffries for copy editing the manuscript, and Shalani Alisharan for proofreading and making the index.

I begin in the thirtieth century BCE with the earliest description of the cerebral cortex. In the second part I consider the views of Greek philosopher-scientists on the functions of the brain. The third part concerns the long period in which there were virtually no advances in Europe in understanding the brain or any other aspect of the natural world. In the fourth part I describe how even after brain research was again well under way, the cerebral cortex tended to be ignored.

Ancient Egyptian Surgery and Medicine The First Written Mention of the Brain The ªrst written reference to the cortex, indeed to any part of the brain, occurs in the Edwin Smith surgical papyrus (ªgure 1.1). Although written about 1"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"1700 BCE , this papyrus is a copy of a much older surgical treatise dating back to the pyramid age of the Old Kingdom (about thirtieth century BCE ). The papyrus was bought in 1862 by an American Egyptologist, Edwin Smith, from a local in Luxor, probably one of the “hereditary” tomb robbers who inhabit a nearby village. It eventually found its way to the great American Egyptologist James H. Breasted. 1 The publication of Breasted’s translation in 1930 made an enormous impact on medical historians and Egyptologists. 2 Previously, Egyptian medicine had been thought to be a jumble of incantations, amulets, and superstitions. Rational medicine was supposed to begin only with the Greeks. Yet, the Edwin Smith papyrus is clear evidence of a scientiªc observer attempting to understand the human body and to treat, rationally, its injury. The papyrus consists of a coolly empirical description of forty-eight cases, starting from the head and working down to the shoulders, where the copyist stops in midsentence. For each case, the author systematically describes the examination, diagnosis, and feasibility of treatment. Each diagnosis comes to one of three conclusions: that the patient should be told that it is “an ailment that I will treat,” “an ailment that I will try to treat,” or “an ailment that I will not treat.” The word for brain ªrst comes up in case six, a person with a skull fracture: ( Title ) Instructions concerning a gaping wound in his head, pene- trating to the bone, smashing his skull, (and) rending open the brain of his skull. ( Examination ) If thou examinest a man having a gaping wound in his head, penetrating to the bone, smashing his skull, and rending open the brain of his skull, thou shouldst palpate his wound. Shouldst thou ªnd that smash which is in his skull [like] those corrugations which form in molten copper, (and) something therein throbbing (and) ºuttering under thy ªngers, like the weak place of an infant’s crown before it becomes whole . . . (and) he 2 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"[the patient] discharges blood from both his nostrils, (and) he suffers with stiffness in his neck. (Diagnosis ) [you say] an ailment not to be treated. 3 And indeed, the “corrugations” that form in molten copper during the smelting process such as that of early Egypt really do look like cerebral cortex. In several cases, the author notes the relation of the laterality of the injury to the laterality of the symptom. For example, in case ªve, the patient “walks shufºing with his sole on the side of him having that injury which is in his skull.” (Presumably, a contracoup injury; that is, a blow to one side of the head that causes the brain to shift within the cranium and make impact on the inside of the contralateral skull, thereby causing damage contralateral to the site of the blow.) The author was clearly aware that the site of injury determines the locus and nature of the symptoms. Thus, in case thirty-one, “It is a dislocation of a vertebra of the neck extending to this backbone which causes him to be unconscious of his two arms and legs.” Elsewhere, the author mentions the meninges and the cerebrospinal ºuid, and describes aphasia (“he speaks not to thee”) and seizures (“he shudders exceedingly”). Although the document is startling in its rationality and empiricism and in the virtual absence of superstition and magic, Breasted did tend to overin- terpret the papyrus; he wrote, for example, “this recognition of the localization of function in the brain . . . shows an astonishing early discernment which has been more fully developed by modern surgeons only within the present gen- erations.” 4 Perhaps Breasted’s greatest ºight of fancy was the suggestion that the papyrus was written by Imhotep, a famous physician who ºourished about the time the original of the papyrus was written. There is absolutely no evidence that he wrote it, however; in fact, he is very unlikely to have done so, since the papyrus deals largely with battle wounds, and in the rigidly hierarchical world of Egyptian medicine, Imhotep was certainly not a battleªeld surgeon. He certainly was, however, an interesting ªgure in his own right. 5 He was the grand vizier of the third dynasty Pharaoh Zoser (2700–2650 BCE ).

Statuettes like this one, from the Civica Raccolta Egizia in Milan, must have been common, as there are, for example, forty-eight in the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum, twenty-one in the Cairo Museum, about ªfty in the Louvre, and ten in the Hermitage (Hurray, 1928). 4 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"contemporary inscription describes him as “chancellor of the king of Lower Egypt, the ªrst after the King of Upper Egypt, administrator of the great palace, hereditary noble, high priest of Heliopolis, the builder, the sculptor.” He is credited with designing the step pyramid of Sakkara, which was the tomb of Zoser, the ªrst pyramid, and the ªrst example of large-scale dressed stone architecture. He was also a priest, astrologer, and magician. Yet his fame as a physician seems to have impressed his contemporaries and later generations most of all. Miniature statues of him were used as amulets to ward off disease (ªgure 1.2), and eventually, he was deiªed as the Egyptian god of medicine (ªgure 1.3), an unusual honor even for a successful physician. 6, 7 The Legacy of Egyptian Medicine The period of the Middle Kingdom (starting about 2000 BCE ) saw a gradual decline in the artistic, architectural, and intellectual creativity and vibrancy that characterized the earlier dynasties. The society became more rigid and hierar- chical, intellectual life more dominated by priests, sculptures were largely copies of earlier works, and buildings more gigantic and grandiose. The rational and empirical spirit of medical practice that suffuses the Edwin Smith papyrus largely gave way to mysticism, religion, and elaborate speculations on the next world. 8 Yet, the fame of ancient Egyptian medicine lived on, in the Odyssey, in the Old Testament, among the presocratic physicians, in Galen, in the Cabala, and today, in any New Age boutique or “health food” store. It is important to view the correlations between brain injury and symp- tom in the Smith papyrus in the context of ancient Egyptian medical theory and practice. We know that the Egyptians thought that the heart was the most important organ in the body, the seat of the mind, and the center of intellectual activities. This is clear from their philosophical and religious writings, and emphasized by their practice of mummiªcation. Both Herodotus’s descriptions 9 of the process of embalming and later examination of mummies show the contrast between the importance of the heart and brain in Egyptian thought. The ªrst step in mummiªcation was to scoop out the brain through the nostrils 5 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"6 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"with an iron bar. In contrast, the heart (and most other internal organs) was either elaborately wrapped and replaced in the body or carefully stored in canopic jars near the body. As indicated in the Book of the Dead, ancient Egyptians considered it essential that the body be preserved and all the impor- tant organs be retained so that in the afterlife the body would be in a suitable condition for resurrection when the soul returned to it. Dead Pharaohs were prepared for their next life with everything but a brain. The idea of the heart as the sensory and intellectual center of the body seems to have been universal, as it occurs also in other ancient civilizations such as Mesopotamia, Babylonia, and India. 10, 11 It is reported to be common among preliterature cultures, 12 as well, as illustrated by the oft-quoted remark of a Pueblo chief to C.G. Jung, 13 “I know you white men think with the brain. That accounts for your shortcomings. We red men think with the heart.” Ancient Chinese medicine held rather more complicated views than the rela- tively simple heart-centered ones, but it also seems to have largely ignored the brain. 14 In fact, the role of the brain in perception and cognition does not appear to enter Chinese thought until the Jesuit Matteo Ricci’s treatise (1595, in Chinese) on the art of memory, which he wrote as part of his campaign to convert the scholar class. 15 As we will see, the view that the heart was the seat of sensation and thought was even held by the greatest of all savants, Aristotle. It persisted for over a millennium, together with the more prevalent theory that the brain, not the heart, was crucial for these functions. Figure 1.3 Imhotep as the Egyptian god of medicine. The earliest known divine repre- sentation of Imhoptep dates from about 525 BCE , about twenty-ªve centuries his death. This painting is from the temple of Ptah at Karnak. Typical for a god, he wears a ceremo- nial beard and carries a scepter in his right hand and an ankh in his left, and a lion’s tail is attached to his belt. The hieroglyphs representing an abbreviated version of his name are circled. The most famous temple devoted to Imhotep was at Memphis, and became a hos- pital and school of medicine and magic. By Ptolemaic times Imhotep was assimilated into the Greek god of medicine, Asclepias (Hurray, 1928). 7 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Greek Philosopher-Scientists and the Beginning of Brain Science The approach to head injury of the Edwin Smith surgical papyrus stands out as a rock of empiricism in the sea of mysticism and superstition in which biological and medical writings in the Near East swam for about the next twenty-four centuries. Even so, one could hardly call the papyrus scientiªc. Science is not just craft or knowledge. Medical science is not just description of symptoms or treatment, and it is not just the absence of superstition or magic. Rather, science, or perhaps we should say formal, self-conscious science, is the assumption that the world can be understood by human reason, a mechanism that works in some consistent way with a regularity governed by a limited set of rules. In this scientiªc world view, the universe is not the playground of gods and ghosts acting in a capricious fashion, moved by passion and whim. Science is public: it demands rational, critical debate; it involves observation, description, and measurement; it carries the assumption that underlying prin- ciples or laws are potentially accessible by these methods. This idea of formal science begins, at least in the West, with a group of Greek thinkers known as presocratic philosophers. 16 They used the term physi- ologia to describe themselves, which is perhaps best translated as “natural phi- losophers,” rather than physiologists, physicists, or just philosophers. Miletus, Cradle of Science The earliest presocratics came from Miletus, one of a set of Greek city-states in Ionia, located on the west shore of modern Turkey (ªgure 1.4). What was special about this time and place that made it the cradle of science? The Ionians were a Greek people deriving from Crete. They were pioneers living in a new land and creating a new set of political institutions. The Bronze Age was becoming the Iron Age, enabling the cheap production of tools and weapons, and thus these city-states could maintain themselves, at least for a while, in the face of the empires to their East. By the sixth century BCE , Miletus was a great 8 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"port city that had established trading colonies throughout the Mediterranean and Black seas. It was a meeting of the sea lanes of Greek, Phoenician, and Egyptian traders and the overland caravans from the East as far as India and China. Its wealth derived both from its merchant ships and from local industries such as textiles and pottery. With its rich ferment of races, cultures, and ideas, Miletus was an interface between East and West. At about this time, the rule of the landed aristocracy was breaking up and power was going to the merchant classes. They had the wealth to support speculation on the nature of the universe, and they had the desire for new techniques, particularly in math and astronomy. In addition, the development of alphabetic writing broke the monopoly held by the class of scribe-priests that characterized the cuneiform and hieroglyphic civilizations. The Ionian philosophers were neither prophets nor priests, but usually inventors, engineers, traders, or politicians, and often several of these at once. Slavery was not yet so pervasive that the ruling classes regarded manual labor with contempt. Figure 1.4 Some of the important centers of classical medicine and biology. 9 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Finally, in these new city-states there was debate about the nature of society and about the best form of government. These freedoms to question the nature of social institutions seem to have been part of the spirit of inquiry into the physical and biological world. All this ferment bubbled up into the beginning of the systematic examination of the universe that we call science. Thales (ca. 583) was the ªrst of the presocratic philosophers and thus is traditionally named the ªrst (Western) scientist. He visited Egypt, returned with a number of geometric facts, and applied them to practical problems such as measuring the height of a building and the distance of a ship at sea. He seems to have been the ªrst to conceive of the value of a general proposition or theorem in geometry. He is credited with such proofs as that the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal and a circle is bisected by its diameter. 17 Thales is most famous, however, for his idea that water was the basic and original substance. He thought that the earth was a ºat disk ºoating on water, that water was all around the world, and that the heavenly bodies were water vapor. What is new or scientiªc about this? After all, the Egyptians, the Babylonians, and indeed all peoples have cosmologies about how things began, and water cosmologies are particularly common. For example, in one Babylo- nian legend 18 the creator is Marduk and “All the lands were sea . . . Marduk bound a rush mat upon the face of the waters, he made dirt and piled it on the rush mat.” Thales’s cosmology was fundamentally different from the Baby- lonian and other prescientiªc ones for two reasons. First, he left gods such as Marduk out of his scheme. Second, he sought a common element underlying all phenomena. Alcmaeon of Croton, the First Neuroscientist By the middle of the ªfth century BCE there were three major centers of Greek medical science: Croton, in what is now southern Italy, Agrigentum on the south coast of modern Sicily, and Cos, an island off modern Turkey. The oldest was in Croton, and its most famous member was Alcmaeon. Alcmaeon (ca. 450) was the ªrst writer to champion the brain as the site of sensation and cognition. 19 He also seems to have been the ªrst practitioner 10 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"of anatomic dissection as a tool of intellectual inquiry. His most detailed dissections and theories were on the senses, particularly vision. Alcmaeon described the optic nerves and noted that they came together “behind the forehead” (which is why, he opined, the eyes move together) and suggested that they were “light-bearing paths” to the brain. He removed and dissected the eye and observed that it contained water. Observations of what are now called phosphenes occurring after a blow to the eye led him to conclude that the eye also contained light (ªre) and that this light was necessary for vision. This became the basis of theories of vision that persisted beyond the Renais- sance. Indeed, Alcmaeon’s idea of light in the eye was only disproved in the middle of the eighteenth century. 20 Among the other presocratic philosopher-scientists who adopted and expanded on Alcmaeon’s view of the functions of the brain were Democritus, Anaxagoras, and Diogenes 21 (all ca. 425). Democritus developed a version that became especially inºuential because of its impact on Plato. Speciªcally, Democritus taught that everything in the universe is made up of atoms of different sizes and shapes. The psyche (soul, mind, vital principle) is made up of the lightest, most spherical, and fastest-moving atoms. Although the psychic atoms are dispersed among other atoms throughout the body, they are especially numerous in the brain. Slightly cruder atoms are concentrated in the heart, making it the center of emotion, and still cruder ones are located in the liver, which consequently is the seat of lust and appetite. As discussed in the next section, this trichotomy developed into Plato’s hierarchy of the parts of the soul. Then, much later, in Galen’s medical theorizing, these three parts became the three pneumas of humoral physiology that dominated medical thought for centuries. 22 Alcmaeon’s view of the hegemony of the brain was not universal among the presocratic philosopher-scientists. For example, Empedocles (ca. 445), the leading member of the medical center at Agrigentum, the second great center of Greek medicine, taught that the blood was the medium of thought, and the degree of intelligence depended on the composition of the blood. 23 Thus, for him, the heart was the central organ of intellect and the seat of mental disorder, as it had been among Near Eastern civilizations. 11 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Hippocratic Doctors The third great center for the teaching and practice of medicine in the ªfth century BCE was the island of Cos, and its most famous member was Hippocrates (ca. 425). The ªrst large body of Western scientiªc writings that have survived is the Hippocratic corpus. Although there is no question that Hippocrates was a real historical ªgure, it is not clear which of the works called Hippocratic he actually wrote. The corpus consists of over sixty treatises that vary enormously in style and technical level, and that were not written by one author or even in one period. It may have been the remaining part of the medical library at Cos or, alternatively, it may have been assembled some time later in Alexandria. 24 Unlike Alcmaeon and the Croton School, the Hippocratic doctors did not practice dissection and their knowledge of anatomy was slight. Like presocratic thinkers in general, however, they rejected supernatural causes of disease and sought natural explanations through observation and extended case studies. Such detailed studies of disease processes were rare until after the Renaissance, and even then they tended to be advertisements for the skill of the physician rather than empirical studies. The Hippocratic work of greatest relevance to brain function is the famed essay “On the Sacred Disease,” that is, epilepsy. Probably designed as a lecture for laymen, it opens with an homage to reason and a rejection of superstition 25 : I do not believe that the “Sacred Disease” is any more divine or sacred than any other disease, but, on the contrary, has speciªc characteristics and a deªnite cause. . . It is my opinion that those who ªrst called this disease “sacred” were the sort of people we now call witch-doctors, faith-healers, quacks, and charlatans. These are exactly the people who pretend to be very pious and to be particularly wise. By invoking a divine element they were able to screen their own failure to give suitable treatment and so called this a “sacred” malady to conceal their ignorance of its nature. 12 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The author has no doubt that the brain is the seat of this disease. As to the general functions of the brain, he is equally clear: It ought to be generally known that the source of our pleasure, merriment, laughter, and amusement, as of our grief, pain, anxiety, and tears, is none other than the brain. It is specially the organ which enables us to think, see, and hear, and to distinguish the ugly and the beautiful, the bad and the good, pleasant and unpleasant . . . It is the brain too which is the seat of madness and de- lirium, of the fears and frights which assail us, often by night, but sometimes even by day; it is there where lies the cause of insomnia and sleep-walking, of thoughts that will not come, forgotten duties, and eccentricities. Furthermore, he states that neither the diaphragm nor the heart has any mental functions, as some claimed: “Neither of these organs takes any part in mental operations, which are completely undertaken by the brain.” What then is the cause of epilepsy, the so-called sacred disease?

These extracts typify Hippocratic medicine: absence of superstition, ac- curate clinical description, ignorance of anatomy, and physiology that is largely a mixture of false analogy, speculation, and humoral theory. Perhaps the entire history of medicine can be viewed as the narrowing of the gap between the 13 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"medical empiricism characteristic of the School of Cos and the knowledge of structure and mechanism sought by the School of Croton. Finally, it should be noted that the Hippocratic oath not only had no connection with the Hippocratic School but is quite deviant from mainstream Greek medical and social practice in several ways. 26 In its original form it forbids both suicide and abortion, but, in fact, neither was censured or illegal in Hippocratic times, or more generally, in classical Greece and Rome. The oath also forbids surgery. Although surgical intervention was not common, it was deªnitely carried out by Hippocratic doctors to drain pus, set fractures, and reduce dislocations. Finally, Hippocratic doctors, like most others before and after, taught for a fee, despite the oath’s injunctions against such practices. The so-called Hippocratic oath seems to have derived from a later secret neopythagorean sect that was antisuicide, antiabortion, and antisurgery. It may then have become popular with the rise of Christianity, since the Church was opposed to suicide and abortion, and with the separation of medicine from the “lower craft” of surgery. Plato: Antiscientist Plato (427–347 BCE ) was unsympathetic to what we and the presocratics meant by science: the empirical investigation of the universe. Indeed, because of the beauty and subtlety of his dialogues, and his towering reputation outside of science, particularly in ethics and politics, Plato can be considered one of the most important ideological opponents of natural science of all time. Further- more, he dominated European philosophy until about the twelfth century, when Aristotle began to ªlter into Europe through Muslim civilization. As we will see later, Aristotle, unlike Plato, was very heavily involved in and enthu- siastic about scientiªc investigation. Plato was born in Athens at a time when that city was the center of the Greek intellectual world. He came from an aristocratic background and was Socrates’s most famous student. After Socrates was executed for subversion by the Athenian democracy, Plato left Athens and traveled widely for about a dozen years. He then returned to Athens at the age of forty and founded a 14 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"school, the Academy, where he taught primarily politics and ethics for another four decades until his death. Whereas the presocratic philosophers sought laws independent of the supernatural, Plato made “natural laws subordinate to the authority of divine principle,” as Plutarch put it. Furthermore, whereas, most of the earlier natural philosophers stressed observation over reason alone, Plato took the opposite view 27 : [The universe is] to be apprehended by reason and intelligence, but not by sight ( Republic, 529). . . . If we are to know anything absolutely we must be free from the body and behold actual realities with the eye of the soul alone ( Phaedo, 66). In the Republic (529–30) Plato ridicules the observational approach of the astronomer: The starry heavens . . . are to be apprehended by reason and intelligence, but not by sight . . . a true astronomer will never imagine that the proportions of night, day or both to the month, or of the month to the year . . . and any other things that are material and visible can also be external and subject to no devia- tion—that would be absurd; and it is equally absurd to take so much pains in establishing their exact truth. He is similarly opposed to the experimental acoustics of the Pythagoreans, as in this exchange between Glaucon and Socrates ( Rep., 531): Socrates: The teachers of harmony compare the sounds and conso- nances which are heard only, and their labor, like that of the astronomers is in vain. 15 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Glaucon: Yes, by heaven! And it is as good as a play to hear them talking about their condensed notes, as they call them; they put their ears close alongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from their neighbor’s wall—one set of them declaring that they distinguish an intermediate note and have found the least interval which should be the unit of measurement; the others insisting that the two sounds have passed into the same—either party setting their ears before their understanding. Socrates: You mean those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings and rack them on the pegs of the instrument . . . they too are in error, like the astronomers; they investigate the num- bers of the harmonies which are heard, but they never attain to prob- lems. Plato’s rejection of the possibility of a biology of behavior is similarly total, as in this ridicule of Anaxagoras by the now condemned Socrates in Phaedo (97–99): Then I heard someone reading, as he said, from a book of Anaxagoras, that mind was the disposer and cause of all . . . What expectations I had formed, and how grievously was I disappointed! As I proceeded, I found my philosopher altogether forsaking mind or any other principle of order, but having recourse to air, and ether, water, and other eccentricities. I might compare him to a person who began by maintaining generally that mind is the cause of the actions of Socrates, but who, when he endeavored to explain the causes of my several actions in detail, went on to show that I sit here because my body is made up of bones and muscles; and the bones, he would say, are hard and have joints which divide them, and the muscles are elastic, and they cover the bones, which have also a covering or environment of ºesh and skin which contains them; and as the bones are lifted at their joints by the 16 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"contraction or relaxation of the muscles, I am able to bend my limbs, and this is why I am sitting here in a curved posture—that is what he would say; and he would have a similar explanation of my talking to you, which he would attribute to sound, and air, and hearing and he would assign ten thousand other causes of the same sort, forgetting to mention the true cause, which is, that the Athenians have thought ªt to condemn me, and accordingly I have thought it better and more right to remain here and undergo my sentence; . . . to say that I do as I do because of my muscles and bones and that this is the way in which mind acts, and not from the choice of the best, is a very careless and idle mode of speaking. Whereas Anaxagoras and the other presocratics were searching for a mechanistic cause of behavior, Plato’s conception of cause was a teleological one, or, perhaps it might be better called an ethical one. Plato did more than satirize the methods and goals of the presocratics. He offered an alternative program. He taught that things we see are only superªcial appearances, shadows in a cave, and hardly worth serious considera- tion. Corresponding to each kind of object are Ideas or Forms that are both the origin and the cause of objects that we see. For example, there are various cups in the sensory world, all of which are different, imperfect, and transient. In contrast, the Idea or Form of a cup is perfect and eternal—the archetype of all cups past, present, and future. The goal of the philosopher is to understand these ideas and especially the higher ones such as Virtue, or the highest of all, the Idea of God. The philosopher must escape the tyranny of sensory experi- ence and empirical knowledge and climb out of the cave in order to reach the higher realities of true knowledge ( Rep., VII). Plato’s views on the brain were set out in most detail in the Timaeus (pp. 69–71), his cosmological essay that was extraordinarily inºuential in the Middle Ages. The soul, which is prior to the body, is divine and comes from the soul of the universe. It is divided into three parts, following Democritus’s three levels of atoms. Reason or intellect is the highest and immortal part and 17 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"lies in the brain, which controls the rest of the body. In his words “It is the divinest part of us and lords over all the rest.” The higher division of the mortal soul lies in the heart. To avoid it polluting the divine soul a neck was built between the two. Appetite, the lowest division, was placed in the liver, “tethered like a beast . . . as far as possible from the seat of counsel” in the head. In the Republic (435–442) the three parts of the soul are compared with the three classes of Plato’s Utopia. Just as the divine soul or reason must be kept separate from base sensation and appetite, so must rulers be protected from contamination by the masses. The Timaeus did convey presocratic and Hippocratic ideas about the brain, body and, more generally, the universe to the Middle Ages It was particularly successful in spreading Plato’s teleology and his rejection of sensa- tion and observation in favor of reason. Thus, modern historians of science have referred to its role in the history of science as “nefarious,” “essentially evil,” and “an aberration.” 28 Aristotle on Brain and Heart Aristotle’s name is invariably linked to philosophy; indeed, for centuries he was known as “The Philosopher.” He was also the leading biologist of classical antiquity and one of the greatest biologists of all times. 29 He is usually consid- ered the founder of comparative anatomy, the ªrst embryologist, the ªrst taxonomist, the ªrst evolutionist, the ªrst biogeographer, and the ªrst systematic student of animal behavior. Not only was he important to the development of biology, but his experience in biological research played an essential role in his own development as a thinker. Over a quarter of his writings were on biology, and his biological work was crucial in distancing him from his teacher, Plato. 30 Beyond biology, he was a true universal genius, writing with permanent impact on such subjects as logic, metaphysics, art, theater, psychology, economics, and politics. His dominating inºuence on the physical and biological sciences, however, largely disappeared in the last several centuries. Perhaps Aristotle’s most egregious scientiªc error fell in the domain we now call neuroscience: he 18 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"systematically denied the controlling role of the brain in sensation and move- ment, giving this function instead to the heart. Aristotle was born in 384 BCE in Stageira to a medical family. His father, who had been personal physician to Amyntas II, King of Macedonia (father of Philip II), died at a young age, and Aristotle’s early education was probably provided by his father’s fellow physicians. In those days, as now, a well- educated physician needed some general culture, so at the age of seventeen he was sent off to Plato’s Academy in Athens. He stayed there for twenty years and never did begin his medical training. When Plato died in 347, his nephew took over the Academy, and Aristotle left Athens with some friends for the island of Lesbos and the adjacent mainland where he apparently spent much time studying marine biology. Philip then appointed him private tutor to his son, Alexander, until, at age sixteen, Alexander became regent of Macedonia and had little time for further academic studies. Aristotle returned to Athens in 335 and founded a new school and research center, the lyceum. It received ªnancial support from Alexander who, according to Pliny, also sent it biological specimens as he proceeded to conquer the known world. Thirteen years later and a few months before his death, Aristotle was driven from Athens by the ascent of anti-Alexandrian factions. Aristotle, or so Diogenes Laertius and other ancient authorities tell us, was small, lisping, sarcastic, arrogant, elegant, and happily married. 31 Now let us turn to Aristotle’s views on the brain, which have embarrassed and puzzled historians and scientists since Galen of Pergamum, who “blushed to quote” them. 32 Aristotle believed that the heart, not the brain, was the center of sensation and movement 33 : And of course, the brain is not responsible for any of the sensations at all. The correct view [is] that the seat and source of sensation is the region of the heart. (PA656a) . . . the motions of pleasure and pain, and generally all sensation plainly have their source in the heart. (PA666a) 19 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":". . . all sanguineous animals possess a heart, and both movement and the dominant sense perception originate there. (SW456a) . . . in all sanguineous animals the supreme organ of the sense- faculties lies in the heart. (YO469a) Table 1.1 summarizes Aristotle’s arguments. Aristotle was well aware of the earlier claims for the dominance of the brain as opposed to the heart, such as those of Alcmaeon, Plato, and Hip- pocrates, and repeatedly argues against these “fallacious” views (PA656a, b). For example, he claims his predecessors say that there is a scarcity of ºesh around the brain so that sensation can get through. But, Aristotle answers, the ºeshless- ness is in accordance with the cooling function of the brain; furthermore, the back of the head is also ºeshless, but it has no sense organs. The earlier theorists observed that the sense organs are placed near the brain, but Aristotle gives a number of alternative reasons for that. For example, the eyes face forward so that we can see along the line we are moving, and “. . . it is reasonable enough that the eyes should always be located near the brain, for the brain is ºuid and cold, and the sense organ of sight is identical in its nature with water.” The ears are located on the sides of the head to hear sounds from all directions. In any case, some animals hear and smell but do not have these organs in their head. Furthermore, sense organs are in the head because the blood is especially pure in the head region, which makes for more precise sensation. Galen and many subsequent historians of medicine were somewhat unfair in maintaining that Aristotle simply dismissed the brain as cold and wet. Rather, for Aristotle the brain was second only to the heart in importance and was essential to the functioning of the heart. In fact, the two formed a unit that controlled the body. The heart, which is naturally hot, he determined, must be counterbalanced, in order to attain the mean, the true and the rational position. Thus, the brain, which is naturally cold, “tempers the heat and seething of the heart” (PA652b): 20 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"For if the brain be either too ºuid or too solid, it will not perform its ofªce, but in the one case will freeze the blood and in the other will not cool it at all, and thus, cause disease, madness and death. For the cardiac heart and the center of life is most delicate in its sympathies and is immediately sensitive to the slightest change or affection of the blood or the outer surface of the brain. (PA653b) Aristotle gave the following explanations for the cold nature of the brain: (a) the blood it contains in its vessels is thin, pure, and easily cooled (SS444a); (b) the vessels on and in the brain are very thin and permit evaporation, cooling Table 1.1 Aristotle’s Arguments for the Heart and Against the Brain as the Center for Sensation and Movement Heart Brain 1.

So that the brain does not become completely cold, it receives a moderate amount of heat from branches of the aorta and the vena cava that end in the membrane that surrounds the brain (PA652b). When the brain cools the hot vapor reaching it from the heart, phlegm is produced. This idea that the brain produces phlegm is also found in “On the Sacred Disease,” as noted above, and is fossilized in our own word “pituitary,” coming from the Latin pituita, which means phlegm. Man’s brain, according to Aristotle, is the largest and moistest brain for its size (HA494b, PA653a). This is because man’s heart is hottest and richest and must be counterbalanced, for man’s superior intelligence depends on the fact that his larger brain is capable of keeping the heart cool enough for optimal mental activity (PA648a, 650b–51a). [Woman’s brain is smaller than man’s (PA653b), a view of Aristotle’s that persisted much longer than his view of the mental functions of the heart.] Thus, Aristotle did not merely dismiss the brain as cold and wet. Indeed, it would have been unlike him to dismiss any organ, as he thought none was made without a function to perform. Rather, he believed the brain played an essential, although subordinate, role in a heart- brain system that was responsible for sensation; indeed, man’s superior intelli- gence is credited to his large brain. Although Aristotle may have not ignored the brain quite as much as is often claimed, it remains puzzling why he made such a startling error and took such a different view from Alcmaeon and the Hippocratic doctors, and above all from his teacher Plato. Aristotle had adduced anatomical, physiological, comparative, embryological, and introspective evidence for his notion of brain function. But an essential approach was absent, namely, the clinical approach, the study of the brain-injured human. The two champions of the hegemony of the brain, Alcmaeon and Hippocrates, were both practicing physicians. The evidence that both gave in support of their opinions was strictly clinical. Since no evidence of systematic experiments on the brain and nervous system appears until Galen in the second century, the accidents of nature were the only sources of information about the function of the brain. It is hard to conceive of 22 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Aristotle, in the course of his strictly zoological observations and dissections, coming across evidence strongly contradicting his theory of the brain and heart. It seems clear that he never dissected a human, and of the forty-nine animals he did dissect, from elephant to snail, the majority were cold blooded, 34 as were the two, chameleon and turtle, that he obviously vivisected (HA503b, YO486b). These did indeed have cold and wet brains, and the connections of the sense organs with the heart (blood vessels) might have seemed more prominent than those with the brain (nerves). On the other hand, he dissected enough vertebrate brains to describe the two covering membranes (HA494b, 495a), the two symmetrical halves (PA669b), and a “small hollow” in the middle (HA495a), perhaps the lateral ventricles. Finally, it should be noted that Aristotle never localized such psychological faculties as imagination, reasoning or memory in the heart or any place else, but instead viewed them as activities of the whole organism. Despite (or perhaps because of ) his father’s profession, Aristotle at no time seemed interested in medicine or medical writing. Indeed, medicine appears to be one of the few things that did not concern this polymath. And, in the fourth century BCE , the study of the effects of damage to the human brain was the most likely way of reaching a “more correct” conception of the brain than Aristotle had. In fact, one of the few places where he approaches a correct view of brain function is in the rare “clinical” passage quoted above (PA653b), in which he suggests that mental disease follows from a malfunc- tioning of the brain’s cooling functions. As discussed in detail below, 600 years later, Galen’s observations of human head injuries led him to perform the ªrst recorded experiments on the brain (using piglets), and his observations of spinal injuries to gladiators led directly to his brilliant series of experiments on the effects of spinal cord transection. Even today, it is often primarily clinical data that inspire experiments on animal brains. Aristotle was a pure biologist, not an applied one, and in his day the methodology of academic biology was incapable of deªning the brain’s actual role. Alcmaeon and the Hippocratic doctors’ theory of the dominance of the brain in mental life soon prevailed. It was transmitted through Plato’s Timaeus to the Arab world and then to medieval and Renaissance Europe. 35 Yet, 23 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Aristotle’s advocacy of the hegemony of the heart persisted alongside. A common resolution was to combine the two views. For example, the great Arab Aristotelian and physician Ibn Sina (Avicenna) did this by placing sensa- tion, cognition, and movement in the brain, which in turn he believed was controlled by the heart. 36 Similarly, according to the thirteenth-century Hebrew encyclopedist Rabbi Gershon ben Schlomoh d’Arles, 37 the brain and heart share functions, so “when one . . . is missing, the other alone continues its activities . . . by virtue of their partnership.” As Scheherazade 38 tells it on the 439th night, when the Caliph’s savant asks the brilliant girl Tawaddud, “where is the seat of understanding,” she answers, “Allah casteth it in the heart whence its illustrious beams ascend to the brain and there become ªxed.” And Portia’s song in the Merchant of Venice asks, Tell me where is fancie bred, Or in the heart or in the head. Despite his fallacious understanding of brain function, Aristotle actually facilitated the subsequent development of the study of the brain. At the most general level, his stress on the importance of dissection, coupled with his prestige, encouraged others to carry out anatomical studies. 39 More speciªcally, he played several roles, albeit indirect ones, in the founding of the great Museum at Alexandria, and it was here that systematic human neuroanatomy started. The Alexandrians and the Beginning of Human Neuroanatomy Neither the presocratics nor the Hippocratic doctors referred speciªcally to the convolutions of the cerebral cortex. The ªrst to do so was Praxagoras of Cos 40 (ca. 300) and his student Philotimos. Praxagoras’s primary claim to fame was that he was among the ªrst to distinguish arteries and veins clearly and to use the pulse as a major diagnostic technique. He also referred to the “long ºexuosities and winding and folding of the convolutions” of the brain. How- 24 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"ever, the functions of these convolutions were not considered until the begin- ning of the study of human anatomy in the Museum at Alexandria. The museum was founded at the end of the fourth century BCE by Ptolemy I, the ªrst Greek ruler of Egypt. It was a vast state-supported institute for research, perhaps like some combination of the National Institutes of Health and the Institute for Advanced Study or All Souls College. Over 100 professors lived communally and had their salaries and expenses paid by the government. The museum contained lecture and study rooms, an astronomical observatory, a zoo, a botanical garden, and dissecting and operating rooms. 41 Its huge library was named a wonder of the ancient world. In several ways, the museum was a continuation and expansion of Aristotle’s Lyceum. 42 First, Ptolemy I had been a young pupil of Aristotle, along with Alexander. Presumably, Aristotle stressed biology in their tutorials since that was his major interest at the time. Second, Demetrius and Strato, who were both students of Theophrastus, Aristotle’s long-term collaborator and his successor as head of the Lyceum, were called to Alexandria by Ptolemy to advise him on the organization of the museum. (Ptolemy tried unsuccessfully to hire Theophrastus himself.) Third, the core of the library’s collection is thought to have been gathered by Demetrius, at least in part, from Aristotle’s own collection. As Strabo, the ªrst-century historian and geographer, later put it, “Aristotle taught the kings of Egypt how to organize a library.” 43 Thus, it was in the shadow of Aristotle that the great museum anatomists, Herophilus (ca. 270) and then Erasistratus (ca. 260), began the systematic study of the structure of the human body. 44 The immediate cause of this extraordinary surge in anatomy in second-century Alexandria was that it was the ªrst time and place in which open dissection of the human body could be carried out. Previously, dissections had been done only on animals. The Greek reverence (and dread) of the dead human body had made its dissection quite impossible. What made Alexandria different? A number of factors seem to have come together. 45 One was that Herophilus and Erasistratus had the full support of a totalitarian regime determined to glorify itself through the achievement of its 25 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"scientists. As absolute rulers in a foreign land, the Ptolemys brought few inhibitions with them. A second factor must have been that dissection of the human body for the purposes of mummiªcation had been practiced in Egypt for centuries, and thus the general cultural background undoubtedly helped make human dissection possible. However, it is very unlikely that Greek anatomists had any contact with Egyptian embalmers, as the social gap between the Greeks in Alexandria and the natives surrounding them seems to have been enormous. 46 Another factor may have been changes in philosophical attitudes toward dying and the human corpse that were becoming common by this time: Aristotle had taught that after death the body was no more than a physical frame without feeling or rights. The uniqueness of the Alexandria-anatomy nexus is revealed by the fact that not only was human dissection ªrst practiced in that city, but this was the ªrst and virtually the only place where human vivisection was systematically carried out for scientiªc purposes. 47 As Celsus, the Roman historian of medi- cine, put it 48 : It is therefore necessary [for medical students] to dissect the bodies of the dead and examine their viscera and intestines. Herophilus and Erasistratus, they say, did this in the best way by far when they cut open men who were alive, criminals out of prisons, received from kings. And while breath still remained in these criminals, they inspected those parts which nature previously had concealed . . . Nor is it cruel, as most people maintain, that remedies for innocent people of all times should be sought in the sacriªce of people guilty of crimes, and only a few such people at that. Vivisection of humans for scientiªc research was never systematically practiced again until the Germans and Japanese did it in World War II. Even the dissection of human cadavers disappeared in the West until it was revived in the new medieval universities in the thirteenth century, and then initially only for forensic, not medical or scientiªc, purposes. 49 26 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Both Herophilus and Erasistratus were particularly interested in the brain. They provided the ªrst detailed, accurate descriptions of the human brain including the ventricles. 50 Like Alcmaeon and the Hippocratic doctors before them, they had no question about the brain’s dominant role in sensation, thought, and movement. Herophilus claimed that the fourth ventricle was the “command center,” a view later rejected by Galen, 51 who stressed the importance of brain tissue itself. Herophilus compared the cavity in the posterior ºoor of the fourth ventricle with the cavities in the pens that were in use in Alexandria at the time, and it is still called calamus scriptorius, “reed pen,” or sometimes calamus Herophili. Erasistratus likened the convolutions of the brain to the coils of the small intestine, a comparison that persisted into the nineteenth century, often with Erasistratus’s name still attached. Indeed, in the nineteenth century the cerebral convolutions were often called the “enteroid processes,” and many drawings of the cortex looked more like the small intestine than like the brain 52 (see ªgures 1.13 and 1.14). Erasistratus compared the brain convolutions of a number of animals, including hares and stags, with those of humans. From these comparisons, he attributed the greater intelligence of humans to their more numerous convolutions. Galen 53 later ridiculed Erasistratus’s correlation be- tween intelligence and the number of convolutions by noting that a donkey had more brain convolutions than humans. However, Galen and possibly Erasistratus may have been referring to the convolutions of the cerebellum rather than those of the cerebrum. In any case, Galen’s sarcasm had an extraor- dinarily pervasive inºuence and was repeatedly quoted over the next 1500 years, by Vesalius (1543) among others. It seemed to have inhibited any serious interest in the cerebral convolutions until Willis in the seventeenth century. Erasistratus traced both sensory and motor nerves into the brain and was reported to have made experiments on the living brain to determine its functions, but no accounts of this work survive. He certainly had a under- standing of the nature of research, as reºected in this quotation from his work On Paralysis 54 : 27 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Those who are completely unused to inquiry are in the ªrst exercise of their mind, blinded and dazed and straightway leave off the inquiry from mental fatigue and an incapacity that is no less than that of those who enter races without being used to them.

After Herophilos and Erasistratus Alexandrian medicine declined rapidly into various schools that fought over arcane medical theory. 55 Galen of Pergamon, Prince of Physicians Galen (129–199 CE ) was the most important ªgure in ancient medical science and is our best source of information about it. He represents its peak; it was through his eyes that the medieval world saw the human body, and that today we see the panorama of classical anatomy, physiology, and medicine. 56 His principal writings (ªgure 1.5) on the brain that have been translated into English are in On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body, On Anatomical Procedures, and On the Doctrines of Plato and Hippocrates. 57 Galen provided an accurate and detailed account of the anatomy of the brain. Indeed, quite how accurate was not appreciated until recently, when neurohistorians realized that his descriptions ªt the brain of the then much more available ox than they do that of the human. 58 He described the ventricles in considerable detail because they were crucial in his physiological system. The ventricles were the site of storage of psychic pneuma (animal spirits), which was the active principle of both sensory and motor nerves and the central nervous system. On the basis of his extensive clinical experience at the gladiatorial school in Pergamon, Galen distinguished sensory and motor nerves. He believed the 28 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"former traveled to the anterior part of the brain and the latter came from the posterior part, a clear anticipation of Müller’s doctrine of speciªc nerve energies (the idea that the functions of a nerve are determined by its central connec- tions). He viewed sensation as a central process, since he knew from his clinical data as well from his animal experiments that sensation could be impaired by brain injury even when the sense organs were intact. Although the ventricles, particularly the anterior ventricle, were impor- tant as a source of psychic pneuma, Galen located the soul not there but in the solid portions of the brain. Among the arguments for this was his demonstration that when brain lesions penetrated to the ventricles, death did not invariably result even if both sensation and movement were lost. Thus, he placed both the soul and higher cognitive functions in the solid portions. Regardless, he ridiculed Erasistratus’s correlation between intelligence and the number of brain convolutions, with amazingly long-lasting effects, as mentioned above. Galen described the optic chiasm and tract, and observed that the tract was “intimately and ªrmly connected . . . with a part of the brain of a peculiar kind, different in boundaries and circumference from the other parts,” presum- ably the lateral geniculate body. He thought that the optic nerves originated in “the anterior part of the lateral ventricles” (ªgure 1.6) and noted that ex- perimental pressure on this region of the anterior ventricle resulted in blindness. A number of Galen’s experiments concerned the effects on behavior of experimental lesions of both the central and the peripheral nervous system. Perhaps the most famous was his demonstration that section of the recurrent laryngeal nerve eliminates the ability of a pig to vocalize.

In its basic form, the faculties of the mind (derived from Aristotle) were distributed among the spaces within the brain (the ventricles described by Galen). The lateral ventricles were collapsed into one space, the ªrst “cell” or small room. It received input from all the sense organs and was the site of the sensus communis, or common sense that integrated across the modalities. The sensations yielded images, and thus, fantasy and imagination were often located here too. The second or middle cell was the site of cognitive processes: reasoning, judgment, and thought. The third cell or ventricle was the site of memory (ªgure 1.7). Although the basic doctrine remained intact for about 1200 years, there were some minor developments. 59 By the tenth century the original static localization shifted to a more dynamic process analogous to digestion. Sensory inputs were made into images in the ªrst cell and were then transferred to the second cell, whose central location made it warmer, appropriate for further processing (cf. digestion) into cognition. Leftover thoughts were then trans- Figure 1.5 Title page of the Omnia Opera of Galen published in 1541 in Venice. Among the famous anatomists who edited parts of this edition were John Caius, ªrst Master of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge; John Linacre, founder of the Royal College of Physicians; Jacob Syvius, Vesalius’s teacher in Paris and later his archrival; and Vesalius himself, who edited the centrally important On Anatomical Procedures, among other Galenic works in the collection.

These transfers of information occurred through passages between the ventricles that had been described by Galen. Another shift was in the quality of the drawings of the heads in which the ventricles lay, from the crude medieval conceptual representations to the so- phisticated pictorial representations of the Renaissance by such masters as Durer and Leonardo (see chapter 2). How did the cell doctrine arise and why was it so attractive to the medieval and early Renaissance mind? It developed out of a curious amalgam of Greek medical theory and practice and ideological concerns of the early church fathers. Although Galen had described the ventricles in great detail, he localized the mental faculties in the solid portions of the cerebrum. The fourth-century Byzantine Poseidonus developed this idea further. 60 He seems to have been the ªrst to report in detail on the effects of localized brain damage in humans. He said that lesions of the anterior brain substance impaired imagination and lesions of the posterior brain impaired memory, but damage to the middle ventricle produced deªcits in reasoning. The early church fathers were very much concerned with the nonmaterial nature of the soul. Therefore, rather than localize the soul, they localized Aristotle’s classiªcation of its functions, namely, those of the mind such as sensation and memory. Furthermore, they believed that brain tissue was too earthy, too dirty to act as an intermediary between the body and soul, so they located mental faculties in the ventricles, empty spaces of the brain. Thus, Nemesius, Bishop of Emesia (ca. 390), put all the faculties of the soul into the ventricles, following the same anteroposterior pattern as his contemporary Poseidonus, but making the site of mental faculties entirely ventricular. 61 Besides the desire for a suitable intermediary between the body and noncorporeal soul, another contribution to the doctrine of three brain cells may have been a parallel with the Trinity. The three stages of processing postulated for the three cells were also inºuenced, or at least rationalized, by a comparison with the spatial division of function in classical law courts, as in the following quotation from the Anatomia 34 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Nicolai Physici, a twelfth-century text derived from an Islamic synthesis of Nemesius and Poseidonus with Greek humoral and pneumatic physiology 62 : On the account of the three divisions of the brain the ancient philosophers called it the temple of the spirit, for the ancients had three chambers in their temples: ªrst the vestibulum, then the consistorium, ªnally the apotheca. In the ªrst, the declarations were made in law-cases; in the second, the statements were sifted; in the third, ªnal sentence was laid down. The ancients said that the same processes occur in the temple of the spirit, that is, the brain. First, we gather ideas into the cellular phantisca, in the second cell, we think them over, in the third, we lay down our thought, that is, we commit to memory. The speciªc placement in the anterior and posterior cells clearly derives from Galen. As noted above, Galen had put sensory processing in the soft and impressionable anterior regions. He thought the posterior portions were motor in function and therefore hard, in order to be able to move muscles. The early church fathers choose this hard region as a good one for the safe storage of valuable brain goods, that is, memories. Empirical support for the cell doctrine was not lacking, as shown in this quotation from Andre du Laurens (ca. 1597), professor of medicine and chan- cellor of Montpellier University and physician to Henry IV 63 : If we will (saith Aristotle in his Problemes) enter into any serious and deepe conceit we knit the browes and draw them up: if we will call to mind and remember anything, wee hang downe the head, and rub the hinder part, which sheweth very well that the imagination lieth before and the memorie behinde . . . in the diverse pettie chambers in the braine, which the Anatomists call ventricles . . . 35 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"36"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The Rebirth of Brain Science Vesalius Resurrects Neuroanatomy Andreas Vesalius of Padua (1514–1564) was the greatest of the Renaissance anatomists: he rekindled anatomical science and virtually broke Galen’s stran- glehold on the ªeld. He is often paired with Copernicus as an initiator of the scientiªc revolution. In his De Humani Corporis Fabrica (1543), the study Figure 1.8 Title page of Andreas Vesalius’s De Humani Corporis Fabrica (1543) and one of the most striking and famous woodcuts of the fourteenth century.

In any case the engraver of this and the other plates must have been closely supervised by Vesalius. This very busy scene contains many symbols and details of Vesalius’s times and work (O’Malley, 1964; Saunders and O’Malley, 1950). It is a public dissection conducted by Vesalius, recognizable in the center from his portrait. Unlike the custom of the time (see ªgure 1.9), Vesalius is dissecting with his own hands. His assistant, shown below the table, is relegated to sharpening his knives. Such dissections were required by the statutes of the University of Padua. The bodies, usu- ally male, were obtained from executions, which the courts often spaced out for the con- venience of the dissections. This woman tried to escape the hangman by claiming pregnancy, but midwives denied her claim. The dissection is being held outdoors in front of an imaginary Palladian building, with a temporary wooden structure for the spectators that was customary until 1584 when dissections were moved indoors. Ten years later, a permanent dissecting theater was built, which can still be visited in Padua. Vesalius is surrounded by representatives of the university, the city, the church, and the nobility, as well as by other doctors and students. The toga-clad symbols of classi- cal medicine are shown on the same level as Vesalius. Galen’s use of animals is symbolized by the monkey on the left and the dog on the right.

The teaching of anatomy by Vesalius is illustrated in ªgure 1.8 and before Vesalius in ªgure 1.9. Figure 1.10 shows one of Vesalius’s famous and beautiful drawings of a horizontal dissection of the human brain. Vesalius ridiculed the ventricular doctrine of brain function, writing with regard to Reisch’s representation, “Such are the inventions of those who never look into our maker’s ingenuity in the building of the human body.” 66 His principal argument against placing the functions of the soul in the ventricles was that many animals have ventricles similar to those in humans and yet they are denied a reigning soul. Indeed, he so equated human and animal brains that he was opposed to vivisection of the brain in animals because “it would be guilty of depriving brute crea- tures of memory, reason and thought as their structure is the same as that of man.” As to the true functions of the ventricles, he commented 67 : I believe nothing ought to be said of the locations of the faculties . . . of the principle soul in the brain—even though they are so assigned by those who today rejoice in the name of theologians. Despite this skepticism about the importance of the ventricles, note that Vesalius drew and labeled the ventricular structures in much more detail and with much more care than he depicted the cerebral cortex. Ventricular localizations continued among both scientiªc and lay writers. Perhaps the most recent attribution of important cognitive function to the ventricles by a major scientist was Sir Richard Owen’s attempt, in the middle of the nineteenth century, to ªnd the uniqueness of humans in their supposed unique ventricular structures, particularly the hippocampus minor.

Turning to the convolutions, Vesalius pointed out, you “may learn the shape of these twistings by observing the brain of some animals [on your plate] at breakfast or at dinner.” He agreed that Galen was correct in rejecting Erasistratus’s correlation of their number with intelligence; he believed their true function was to allow the blood vessels to bring nutriment to the deeper parts of the brain. 68 Cerebral Cortex: Gland or Rind? The ªrst clear distinction between the cerebral cortex and white matter was made by Archiangelo Piccolomini (1526–1586), professor of anatomy in Rome, who succeeded in separating the two in gross dissection. He called the former cerebrum and the latter medulla, and noticed “certain lines” in the cerebrum. 69 The terms cortex (or rind), substantia cineretia (or brown substance), convo- lutions, and cerebrum continued to be used interchangeably into the nineteenth century. Medullary substance also continued to be a synonym for white matter. As reºected in the word “rind,” most workers attributed little importance to the cortex. Marcello Malpighi (1628–1694), professor in Bologna, the founder of microscopic anatomy and discoverer of capillaries, was the ªrst to examine the cortex microscopically. He saw it as made up of little glands with attached ducts (ªgure 1.11). Similar globules were reported by Leeuwenhoek and many subsequent microscopists. 70 Perhaps they were observing pyramidal cells. 71 At least in Malpighi’s case, artifact is a more likely possibility, since his globules were more prominent in boiled than fresh tissues. 72 Malpighi’s theory of the brain as a glandular organ was commonly held in the seventeenth and eight- eenth centuries, perhaps because it ªt with the much earlier, but still persisting, 41 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Figure 1.11 Malpighi’s cortical glands from his De Cerebri Cortice (1666) with their at- tached ªbers.

One of the earliest advocates of this was Frederik Ruysch (1628–1731), professor of anatomy in Amsterdam, who noted, “the cortical substance of the cerebrum is not glandular, as many anatomists have described it, nay have positively asserted, but wholly vascular.” 74 Here the convolutions were consid- ered mechanisms for protecting the delicate blood vessels of the cortex. Rep- resentative of this notion was Thomas Bartholin (1660–1680), professor of anatomy in Copenhagen and discoverer of the lymphatic system. After yet again rejecting Erasistratus’s association of the convolutions with intelligence, Bartholin indicated that their true purpose was 75 : . . . to make the cerebral vessels safe by guiding them through these tortuosities and so protect them against danger of rupture from violent movements, especially during full moon when the brain swells in the skull. Thomas Willis Turns Toward Cortex Before Gall and the development of his phrenological system at the beginning of the nineteenth century, only a very few isolated ªgures advocated signiªcant functions for the cerebral cortex. The ªrst was Thomas Willis (1621–1675), one of the most important ªgures in brain science since Galen. 76 Willis was educated at Oxford, quite early gained the Chair of Natural Philosophy there as well as a very lucrative private practice, and was one of the founders of the Royal Society. His Cerebri Anatomie 77 was the ªrst monograph on the brain and dealt with physiology, chemistry, and clinical neurology as well as anatomy. Many of its illustrations were by the great architect Sir Christopher Wren, then professor of astronomy at Oxford. Willis implicated the “cortical and grey part of the cerebrum” in the functions of memory and will. In his scheme, sensory signals came along sensory 43 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Figure 1.12 Ventral view of the brain from Willis, Cerebri Anatomie (1664), drawn by Christopher Wren.

They were then elaborated into perceptions and imagination in the overlying white matter (then called the corpus callosum or hard body since it was harder than the cortex) and passed to the cerebral cortex where they were stored as memories. In his words 78 : As often as a sensible impression, such as a visual stimulus, arrives from the periphery it turns inwards like an undulation of water and is transferred to the corpora striata where the sensation received from outside becomes a perception of internal sense. If, however, this impression is carried further and penetrates the corpus callo- sum, imagination takes the place of sensation. If after this the same undulation of the spirits strikes against the cortex, as it were the outermost banks, it imprints there a picture or character of the object which, when it is later reºected from there revives the memory of the same thing. The cortex initiates voluntary movement whereas the cerebellum is involved only in involuntary movement. Willis’s ideas on brain function came not only from his dissections but also from his experiments on animals and correlation of symptoms and pathol- ogy in humans. Willis noticed that whereas the cerebellum was similar in a variety of different mammals, the complexity of the cerebral convolutions varied greatly among animals; this variation was correlated with intellectual capacity: Hence, these folds or convolutions are far more numerous and rarer in man than in any other animal because of the variety and number of acts of the higher Faculties, but they are varied by a disordered and almost haphazard arrangement so that the operations of the animal function might be free, changeable and not limited to one. Those gyri are fewer in quadrupeds, and in such as the cat, they 45 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"are found to have a particular shape and arrangement so that this beast considers or recalls scarcely anything except what the instincts and demands of nature suggest. In the smaller quadrupeds, and also in birds and ªsh, the surface of the brain is ºat . . . Hence it is that animals of this sort understand or learn few things. Despite the importance of the cerebral cortex in Willis’s schema, his work contains no adequate drawing of the cortex; he apparently never asked Wren or anybody else to produce one (ªgure 1.12). In fact, for another 150 years the cortex continued to be drawn as Erasistratus ªrst suggested: as coils of the small intestine (ªgures 1.13 and 1.14). Although Willis was a major ªgure of his time and beyond, his ideas on the importance of the cerebral cortex fell out of favor, and theories of the cortex as a glandular, vascular, or protective rind returned to their original dominance. Two men, however, did challenge the earlier beliefs. The ªrst was Francois Pourfour du Petit (1644–1741), a French army surgeon. 79 He carried out a series of systematic experiments on the effects of cortical lesions in dogs and related them to his clinicopathological observations in wounded soldiers. From these studies he realized that the cerebral cortex plays a critical role in normal movement and that this inºuence is a contralateral one. However, his obser- vations were totally ignored until they were rediscovered much later. Perhaps this was because du Petit did not hold an academic post and he published his account in a very limited edition. Yet, his conclusion that the cortex was insensitive to touch was repeatedly cited to support the theories of von Haller who, as discussed below, was the dominant physiologist of the day. Thus, du Petit’s work demonstrating motor functions of cortex was probably ignored largely because of the anticortex ideology of the time, not because it was published in a minor journal. The second major ªgure advocating the importance of the cortex be- tween Willis and Gall was Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), founder and mystical prophet of the New Jerusalem or Swedenborgian Church, which is still active in United States and Great Britain. On the basis of reviewing the 46 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"contemporary literature, Swedenborg arrived at an amazing set of prescient ideas on the importance of the cerebral cortex in sensation, cognition, and movement.

Von Haller and the Insensitivity of Cortex The space we have given to Willis, du Petit, and Swedenborg, men who thought the cortex was a crucial brain structure, is somewhat misleading since Figure 1.13 The depiction of the cerebral convolutions by Raymond de Viessens of Montpellier, a leading neuroanatomist of the late seventeenth century, in Neurographia Universalis (1685).

He tested sensibility with Figure 1.14 In Vicq d’Azyr’s Traite d’Anatomie et Physiologie (1786) the convolutions still are drawn looking like intestines, but now bear some relation to the actual morphology of the brian. 48 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"mechanical and chemical stimuli and found the cortex to be completely insen- sitive. In contrast, he reported that stimulation of the white matter and subcor- tical structures in experimental animals produced expressions of pain, attempts to escape, or convulsions, thereby demonstrating the sensibility of these structures. From observations such as these Haller concluded that all parts of the cortex were equivalent because stimulation had the same negative effect, and that all subcortical regions were also equivalent because their stimulation had similar positive effects. Thanks to his prestige and many students and followers, Haller’s concept of the insensitivity and equipotentiality of cortex superceded the observations of Willis, Swedenborg, and du Petit, and persisted well into the next century. 81, 82 As to the cortex itself, Haller was of the cortex-as-blood- vessels school 83 : . . . the greater part of it consists of mere vessels . . . as to glandules making the fabric . . . that notion has been discarded; nor has there been any opinion received with less probability than this. Gennari and His Stripe A few years after Swedenborg died, an event occurred that was particularly central to the theme of this discussion: the discovery of the stripe of Gennari, which we now know marks, in primates, the location of striate cortex—the primary visual cortex. Francisco Gennari (1752–1797), then a medical student, in the course of examining frozen sections of an unstained human brain, observed and reported on a white line in the cortex that was especially prominent and sometimes double in the posterior part of the brain 84 (ªgure 1.16). This was the ªrst evidence that the cerebral cortex was not uniform in structure. The more famous Vicq d’Azyr 85 rediscovered the stripe and for a while it was known as the stripe of Vicq d’Azyr, until priority was sorted out and the name reverted to Gennari. 86 As to its function, Gennari commented, “Just as the use of so many other things is as yet concealed from us, so I do not know the purpose for which this substance was created.” 87 49 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Figure 1.15 In this drawing from the arti- cle on anatomy in Diderot’s Encyclopedia, note how the ventricular structures are drawn and labeled in detail, whereas the cor- tical convolutions are represented schemati- cally and hardly labeled, reminiscent of Vesalius’s drawing (ªgure 1.10) 200 years earlier (Diderot and D’Alembert, 1751).

C. Spurzheim (1776–1832), the founders of phrenology. 89 Before they de- veloped their phrenological system, the two men made a number of major neuroanatomical discoveries that would have ªxed them in the history of neuroscience even if they had never begun their project of correlating the morphology of the cranium with psychological faculties (ªgure 1.17). Among Gall’s signiªcant anatomical contributions were the recognition that the grey matter is functioning neural tissue connected to the underlying white matter (to which he attributed a conductive function), the ªrst description of postem- bryonic myelinization, proof of the decussation of the pyramids, the ªrst clear description of the commissures, demonstration that the cranial nerves originate below the cerebrum, and the realization that the brain is folded to conserve space. 90 The central ideas of their phrenological system were that the brain was an elaborately wired machine for producing behavior, thought, and emotion, and that the cerebral cortex was a set of organs with different functions. 91 They postulated about “thirty-ªve affective and intellectual faculties” and assumed that (a) these were localized in speciªc organs of the cerebral cortex; (b) the development or prominence of these faculties was a function of their activity, and the amount of activity would be reºected in the size of the cortical organ; and (c) the size of each cortical organ was indicated by the prominence of the overlying skull, that is, in cranial bumps. The primary method of data collection used by Gall and Spurzheim was examining the skulls of a great variety of people from lunatics and criminals to 52 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"the eminent and accomplished (ªgure 1.18). Neuropsychological and animal experimental data, even those gathered by themselves, they considered only minor and ancillary evidence. 92 Phrenology had wide popular appeal, particularly in England and the United States, and among many leading intellectuals, such as Honoré de Balzac, A. R. Wallace, Horace Mann, and George Eliot. 93 However, it met consider- able opposition from the religious, political, and scientiªc establishments of the day. For example, Gall’s public lectures were banned in Austria because they led to materialism and opposed religion and morality. His works were Figure 1.17 This drawing of the cortical convolutions in Gall and Spurzheim’s Anatomie et Physiologie du Systeme Nerveux (1810) is quite accurate, one of the ªrst to be so.

In 1908 the French Institute, later the Academy of Science, under the leadership of the great Cuvier, totally rejected even the anatomical parts of a paper that Gall submitted. Flourens Attacks Gall, but the Cortex (Re)emerges as a Higher Structure In the scientiªc world the most important and inºuential critique of Gall came from Pierre Flourens (1794–1867), later professor of natural history at the Sorbonne. 94 A technically brilliant experimenter, Flourens quickly rose in the French scientiªc establishment and at the age of thirty-ªve was elected to the Academy that had rejected Gall. Starting in the 1820s and continuing for over twenty years, he carried out a series of experiments on the behavioral effects of brain lesions, particularly with pigeons. Flourens reported that lesions of the cerebral hemispheres had devastating effects on willing, judging, remembering, and perceiving. However, the site of a lesion was irrelevant: all regions of the hemispheres contributed to these functions. The only exception was vision, in that a unilateral lesion produced only contralateral blindness, but again there was no localization within the hemisphere. These holistic results tended to eclipse Gall’s ideas of punctate localization, but only in scientiªc circles and only temporarily. Flourens’s ªnding of cognitive losses after hemispheric lesions was actu- ally a conªrmation of Gall’s emphasis on the cognitive role of the cortex, a concept that had been virtually absent before Gall. This change in attitude toward the cortex was reºected in mid-nineteenth-century textbooks that now routinely attributed intellectual function to the cortex. William Carpenter, in his authoritative Principles of Human Physiology, 95 wrote that the convolutions of the cerebrum were: Figure 1.18 Frontispiece and its legend from J. G.

The general idea that the thalamus had major sensory functions and the corpus striatum major motor functions was generally accepted by the middle of the nineteenth century on the basis of a number of studies that traced sensory and motor tracts from the periphery and made experimental lesions in animals. 96 This view of the higher functions of the cortex, common for the period, combined Haller’s notion of insensitivity and both Gall’s and Flouren’s attri- bution of higher faculties, but neither sensory nor motor functions, to the cortex. Broca Conªrms Gall Despite the bitter attacks by Flourens, Gall’s theory of punctate localization, and even many of his speciªc localizations such as language in the frontal lobes and sexuality in the cerebellum, continued to be actively debated in the middle of the nineteenth century. 97 At least in the scientiªc community, the supposed correlations between skull and brain morphology were quickly recognized as erroneous. Yet, Gall’s ideas stimulated the search for correlations between the site of brain injury and speciªc psychological deªcits in patients as well as in experimental animals. Reports of such correlations were published in both the phrenological and mainstream neurological literature, and the question of the localization of psychological function in the brain was hotly debated at scientiªc meetings. 56 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Thus, in 1848, J. B. Bouillard (1796–1881), professor at la Charité in Paris and a powerful ªgure in the medical establishment, 98 offered a cash prize for a patient with major frontal lobe damage who did not have a language deªcit. The debate about localization reached a climax at a series of meetings of the Paris Société d’Anthropologie in 1861. At the April meeting, Paul Broca (1824–1880), professor of pathology at the Sorbonne and founder of the society, announced that he had a critical case on this issue. A patient with long-standing language difªculties—nicknamed “Tan” because that was all that he could say—had just died. The next day Broca displayed his brain at the meeting, and indeed it had widespread damage in the left frontal lobe. Over the next few months he presented several similar cases. Not only did these cases ªnally establish the principle of discrete localization of psychological function in the brain, but the discovery was hailed as a vindication of Gall. Broca himself regarded Gall’s work as “the starting point for every discovery in cerebral physiology in our century.” 99 Evolution and Brain Function Contributing to the growing interest in the cerebral cortex were ideas about organic evolution that were in the air in the decades before the publication of Darwin’s Origin of Species (1861). In J.B. Lamarck’s (1809) theory of evolution, the ªrst coherent one, evolution involved continuous upward progress, the inevitable transformation of lower into upper forms. The anonymous and widely inºuential best-seller Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844) took a similar progressive view of evolution. (See chapter 4.) Herbert Spencer (1820–1903) was the ªrst and most important ªgure to apply evolutionary ideas to the nervous system and psychology. 100 Spencer had virtually no formal education, but read widely in the sciences as a boy. A seminal experience at age 11 was hearing a lecture on phrenology by Spur- zheim, and it was decades before he decisively parted from a phrenological position. Before he did so he published in phrenological journals and invented a more accurate device for measuring skull bumps. After a few years as a railway 57 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"58 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"engineer he drifted into political journalism, where he came into contact with T. H. Huxley, Thomas Carlyle, and George Henry Lewis (and, to use a modern but particularly apt expression, Lewis’s partner, George Eliot), and was exposed to the scientiªc and political issues of the day. In his ªrst book, Social Statics (1851), Spencer set out a quasi-Lamarckian progressive theory of evolution. He argued that it justiªed survival of the ªttest (a phrase Darwin later adopted) in human society. This led him to oppose such things as government help for the poor, public health, and public education. These views were the theoretical bases of the ultraindividualist and conservative ideology that later became known as social Darwinism, although Spencerism would have been a more appropriate designation. 101 Spencer’s social theories were particularly welcome among the elites in postbellum America. As John D. Rockefeller put it in a Sunday school address 102 : The growth of a large business is merely survival of the ªttest. . . . The American beauty rose can be produced in the splendor and fragrance which bring cheer to its beholder only by sacriªcing the early buds which grow up around it. This is not an evil tendency in business. It is merely the working-out of a law of nature and a law of God. In his next work, Principles of Psychology (1855), Spencer combined asso- ciation psychology with evolutionary theory to produce “evolutionary associa- tionism.” From evolution he took the idea of a progressive increase in the complexity of the nervous system both phylogenetically and ontogenetically. This led to the conception of the cortex as the newest, highest, and most important level of the nervous system. Furthermore Spencer posited that Figure 1.19 This ªgure from a 1837 dissertation illustrates the prevailing view at this time that the highest sensory and motor structures were subcortical (the thalamus and the striatum, respectively, although not so labeled here), and only the cortex had mental func- tions (Bennett, 1837). 59 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"function must be localized in the cortex just as it clearly is in lower nervous structures 103 : But no physiologist who calmly considers the question . . . can long resist the conviction that different parts of the cerebrum subserve different kinds of mental action. Localization of function is the law of all organization whatever: separateness of duty is universally accompanied with separateness of structure: and it would be marvellous were an exception to exist in the cerebral hemispheres. Let it be granted that the cerebral hemispheres are the seat of higher psychical activities; let it be granted that among these higher psychical activities there are distinctions of kind . . . more or less distinct kinds of psychical activity must be carried out in more or less distinct parts of the cerebral hemispheres. . . . It is proved experimentally, that every bundle of nerve ªbers and every ganglion, has a special duty; and that each part of every bundle of nerve ªbers and every such ganglion, has a duty still more special. Can it be, then, that in the great hemispherical ganglia alone, this specialization of duty does not hold? When the Origin of Species was published in 1859, Spencer became a enthusiastic follower of Darwin. He set out to unify all knowledge along the principles of Darwinian evolution and attempted to do so in his massive, multivolume Principles of Synthetic Philosophy. Today, his synthetic philosophy is all but forgotten, whereas the disastrous consequences of his social views are still reverberating. However, Spencer did make one permanent and major contribution to modern neuroscience. That was the profound inºuence of his views of the evolution of the nervous system on John Hughlings Jackson. John Hughlings Jackson (1835–1911) is the perennial holder of the title, “father of English neurology.” As a medical student in Yorkshire, he was so enthralled with Spencer’s writings that he almost abandoned medicine to pursue their study full time. Instead, he spent forty-ªve years as a clinical neurologist 60 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"at the National Hospital, Queen Square, London, applying Spencer’s ideas on the evolution and dissolution of the nervous system. Many of his over 300 papers began with such sentiments as “I should say that a very great part of this paper is nothing more than the application of certain of Herbert Spencer’s principles.” Spencer taught that evolution implied a continuity of nervous organiza- tion from spinal cord to cerebral cortex. Therefore, as Jackson put it, “If the doctrine of evolution be true, all nervous centers [including the cortex] must be of sensory-motor constitution,” that is, they must have both sensory and motor functions. 104 It was the combination of Spencer’s theory of cortex as a sensorimotor structure and his insistence on cerebral localization of function, and Jackson’s many observations of seizures (including his wife’s) that led him to the brilliant clinical inference that the seizures we now call Jacksonian reºect a somototopically organized cortical motor mechanism. Jackson’s ideas on the motor mechanisms of the cerebral cortex were dramatically conªrmed in 1870 by Fritsch and Hitsig’s demonstration of speciªc movements from electrical stimulation of the cortex of the dog. 105 These authors were not reticent about the more general implications of their results, as shown by the ªnal lines of their paper: It further appears, from the sum of all our experiments . . . certainly some psychological functions and perhaps all of them . . . need certain circumscribed centers of the cortex. In summary, despite their temporary eclipse under the shadow of Flourens’ experiments, Gall’s general ideas of punctate localization in the cortex were essentially vindicated by the third quarter of the nineteenth century. By that time, they were considered conªrmed by Broca’s demonstration of an association between damage to the frontal lobe and aphasia, and again by Fritsch and Hitzig’s experiments on stimulation of motor cortex. Gall’s ideas on the localization of mental function had a deep and lasting inºuence through stress- ing (a) that the human mind could be subdivided into speciªc functions, 61 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"(b) that these speciªc functions were mediated by discrete brain structures, and (c) that the cerebral cortex was crucially important in mental activity. It is interesting to note that one of the ªrst accurate drawings of the cerebral cortex was by Gall and Spurzheim (ªgure 1.17). Before them the cortex was often portrayed as a pile of intestines (ªgures 1.13 and 1.14) or in a crude schematic way with no attention to detail (ªgure 1.15). Perhaps it is necessary to believe a structure has important functions before one goes to the trouble to portray it accurately. The Search for Sensory Areas in the Cerebral Cortex The last quarter of the nineteenth century saw an intense search for the localization of sensory centers in the cortex. In addition to increasing interest in the cortex from the work of Gall, Flourens, Spencer, Jackson, and Fritsch and Hitzig, a major spur to the search for sensory centers was Johannes Müller’s doctrine of speciªc nerve energies. 106 Müller (1801–1858), professor of anatomy and physiology at Berlin, dominated midnineteenth-century physiology through his personality, his many inºuential students, and his massive Handbuch der Physiologie (1833–1840). Müller’s doctrine had three essential elements. The ªrst and most funda- mental asserted that sensation was the awareness of the states of sensory nerves, not of the outer world itself. This was a radical departure from the widespread view, derived from the presocratic philosophers Leucippus and Democritus, that images ( eidola ) from objects in the world enter the eye and travel to the brain. 107 The second element was that when a given nerve type or nerve energy was excited, the same type of experience is produced no matter what the stimulus. Thus, photic, mechanical, and electrical stimulation of the eye all produce visual sensations. Müller, following Aristotle, assumed that there were ªve nerve types or nerve energies; today, we would call them qualities or modalities. The third element of the doctrine was that the same physical stimulus applied to different sense organs gives rise to different sensations. Thus, a blow to the eye and one to the ear produce visual and auditory sensations, respectively. 62 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Müller was unsure of the locus of nerve speciªcity. As he put it: It is not known whether the essential cause of the peculiar “energy” of each nerve of sense is seated in the nerve itself or in the parts of the brain and spinal cord with which it is connected. A student of Müller, however, the great Hermann von Helmholtz, philosopher, physicist, and psychologist, located the speciªcity squarely in the nerve terminations. Helmholtz, who was the ªrst to measure the speed of nerve conduction, in the original comparison of the nervous system with a telegraph system, noted that with wires 108 : according to the different kinds of apparatus with which we pro- vide terminations, we can send telegraph despatches, ring bells, explode mines, decompose water, move magnets, magnetize iron, develop light and so on. So with the nerves the condition of excitement which can be produced in them and is conducted in them, is, so far as can be recognized in isolated ªbres of a nerve, everywhere the same, but when it is brought to various parts of the brain, or the body, it produces motion, secretions of glands, increase and decrease of the quantity of blood, of redness and of warmth of individual organs, and also sensations of light, of hearing, and so forth. Emil Du Bois-Reymond, another one of Müller’s students, 109 his succes- sor in the Berlin Chair, and discoverer of the action potential, went further and claimed that if it were possible to cross-connect the auditory and optic nerves, we would see with our ears and hear with our eyes. 110 The idea that the speciªcity of nerves derived from their central connec- tions was not new. On the basis of his clinical practice among gladiators in Pergamon, Galen distinguished between sensory and motor nerves, and pro- posed that sensory nerves were connected to the anterior part of the brain and motor nerves to the posterior. Charles Bell (1774–1842), codiscoverer of the 63 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"law of spinal roots, or rather, the sensory half of it, 111 extended the idea of speciªcity inherent in that law to the ªve senses to yield in 1811 an account of nerve speciªcity essentially identical to Müller’s later published one. As Bell put it 112 : the nerves of sense depend for their attributes on the organs of the brain to which they are severally attached . . . the properties of the nerves are derived from their connections with the parts of the brain. It is important to note that for both Bell and Müller it was not the terminations in the cerebral cortex that conveyed speciªcity on the sensory nerves. Rather, for both of them, and, as noted above, more generally for almost all the physiologists and anatomists of the ªrst half of the nineteenth century, the cortex still had no sensory (or motor) functions. The main support for this view was still Haller’s that since the cortex was insensitive to touch, it could hardly be sensory. Instead, it was believed to be the site of the highest intel- lectual functions. This notion was often supported both by the phylogenetic correlation of cortical complexity with intelligence and reports of intellectual deªcits after cortical lesions. It was clearly also heavily inºuenced by Gall’s ideas. Note that of all the thirty-ªve faculties that Gall put into the cerebral cortex, none was sensory or motor. Some of Gall’s faculties do have sensory sounding names, but on examination they are actually cognitive. For example as to the faculty of color, Gall notes, “I do not mean the simple faculty of seeing or perceiving colors . . . [but rather] distinguishing the relations of colors: the talent for painting.” 113 What turned Müller’s doctrine and everybody else’s attention toward the possible sensory functions of the cerebral cortex was Fritsch and Hitzig’s discovery of motor cortex by electrical stimulation in 1870. This unambigu- ously demonstrated that the cerebral cortex had more than just higher functions. Müller’s doctrine of speciªc nerve energies now became directed toward cortex as the locus of speciªc energies. Thus, under its inºuence, in the later 64 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"part of the nineteenth century, (a) neural pathways were traced from the sense organs into the brain to ªnd the speciªc regions in which they ended; (b) the cortex was divided up into separate centers or organs on the basis of the pattern of its structure, thereby yielding the techniques of cytoarchitectonics and myeloarchitectonics; (c) cortical lesions were made in animals to ªnd the sensory centers, and (d) in close parallel, attempts were made to correlate sensory losses in humans with the site of cortical damage. The Discovery of a Visual Center in the Cerebral Cortex Bartolomeo Panizza: The First Claim The ªrst person to suggest a discrete localization of visual function in the cortex on the basis of systematic investigations was Bartolomeo Panizza (1785–1867), professor of anatomy at Pavia and a follower of Gall. 114 After examining the brains of several patients who became blind after strokes, he attributed vision to the posterior cortex. He then tested this idea by making lesions and enu- cleations in a number of species and concluded that the occipital region was the crucial one for vision. He also studied the anatomical and behavioral effects of monocular enucleation as a function of age, and concluded that the effects on the brain were more profound in adults than in infants. Panizza’s work seems to have been totally ignored at the time. One reason for this may have been because he only published in local journals, those of the Royal Institute of Lombardy of Science, Arts, and Letters; however, these journals were ex- changed with those of the Royal Society and presumably other scientiªc societies. A more likely reason for the lack of impact of Panizza’s work was the prevailing theoretical view of the relative role of cortex and subcortex. As we have indicated, at that time it was thought that the thalamus was the highest sensory center and the basal ganglia the highest motor center. In contrast, the cortex was believed to be concerned not with sensation or movement but with intellectual operations. 115 This view went back at least to Gall, who among his 65 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Figure 1.20 Newton (1704) was the ªrst to suggest, in Opticks, that partial decussation at the optic chiasm results in binocular convergence.

Note that Newton thought that binocular fusion occurred in the chiasm itself. There is no reason to believe that Newton had any actual anatomical evi- dence for his model. 66 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"thirty-ªve plus cerebral organs had none for any sensory or motor function. The importance of Panizza’s work was realized only after the work of Ferrier, Munk, and Schafer provided convincing evidence for a cortical visual area, as described in the next section. 116 The Battle for Visual Cortex: Ferrier versus Munk and Schäfer Immediately after Fritsch and Hitzig’s publication, the English physiologist David Ferrier (1843–1928), working at the West Riding Lunatic Asylum and at Kings College, London, conªrmed their work, ªrst in dogs and then in monkeys. 117 He then applied their electrical stimulation methods to search for the sensory cortices. He found that stimulation of the angular gyrus (area 7 in posterior parietal cortex) in the monkey produced conjugate eye movements, and he interpreted this as indicating that this area was the seat of the perception of visual impressions. In contrast, he found that stimulation of the occipital lobe or other regions did not have these effects. He further tested this theory by making angular gyrus lesions (ªgure 1.21) and reported that unilateral lesions produced temporary blindness in the contralateral eye and bilateral lesions produced permanent blindness in both eyes. 118 However, the animals were observed for only a few days before he sacriªced them, the operations having been done without antiseptic techniques. Summarizing the results on four animals with angular gyrus lesions, he wrote: The loss of visual perception is the only result of this lesion, the other senses and the powers of voluntary movement being retained so long as the lesion remains conªned to the angular gyrus itself. By the term visual perception I wish to indicate the consciousness of visual impressions, and to distinguish this from mere impressions on the optical apparatus and reactions which are only of a reºex nature . . . 67 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"In contrast, monkeys with large occipital lesions (ªgure 1.22) showed no visual disturbances at all unless their lesions encroached on the angular gyrus. The only effect of occipital lesions was a temporary loss of appetite. From this he speculated that the occipital lobes were related to the “organic sensibilities and are the anatomical substrata of the correlated feelings which form a large part of our personality and subjectivity.” 119 How did Ferrier account for the ªnding that the visual disturbances were evident only through the contralateral eye? Isaac Newton 120 had described the partial decussation of the optic pathways and its signiªcance for binocular vision clearly in his Opticks (see ªgure 1.20) and several other eighteenth-century ªgures held similar views. Indeed, homonymous hemianopia after unilateral brain damage was explained in terms of partial decussation as early as 1723. 121 Ferrier was aware of both the partial decussation and its possible relation to “hemiopia,” as he called it. However, he thought that the uncrossed ªbers crossed to the opposite hemisphere at some level beyond the chiasm, so that the cortex of each hemisphere received input from the entire contralateral eye.

Munk’s surgical and aseptic techniques were much better than those of Ferrier, and he was able to study his animals for many months. He described two types of blindness after occipital lesions. The ªrst type he called Seelenblindheit or “psychic blindness,” and he reported that it occurred after limited occipital lesions in dogs. The dogs saw objects and avoided bumping into them but did not recognize their meaning: No abnormalities of hearing, taste, smell, motricity or sensation. The dog walks freely about the room without bumping into objects. If one blocks his path, he avoids or adroitly jumps over Figure 1.22 Ferrier (1886) found that these occipital lesions in monkeys do not cause any visual deªcits.

But within the psychic domain of vision a distinctive defect exists: he pays no attention to water or food, even if he is hungry and thirsty. He seems indifferent to everything he sees; threats do not frighten him. One can bring a match up to his eyes without him backing away. Seeing his master or seeing other dogs leaves him impassive . . . he no longer knows or recognizes what he sees. Although these results were never replicated by others and Munk’s interpretation was disputed, the term psychic blindness caught on, in part because the concept ªt the associationist theories of the period. 124 Munk’s observations on psychic blindness were brought to a wide audience by William James, who discussed them in detail in his Principles of Psychology, published in 1890. Thus, when Lissauer published the ªrst detailed anatomic-clinical report of a human visual recognition deªcit in the absence of sensory losses, he adopted Munk’s term and went on to distinguish two types of psychic blindness, apperceptive and associative. Later, Sigmund Freud coined the term “visual agnosia” to replace psychic blindness. 125 However, “psychic blindness” contin- ued to be used and was immediately applied by Heinrich Klüver and Paul Bucy to describe the behavior of their temporal-lobectomized monkeys. (See chap- ter 5.) The second type of blindness Munk distinguished he called Rindenblind- heit, or “cortical blindness.” It was total absence of vision and he found that it followed complete removal of the occipital cortex in both dogs and monkeys. With his monkeys, Munk realized that complete unilateral occipital lesions produce blindness not in the opposite eye but in half of each retina. Presumably the fact that only half the retinal ªbers cross in the monkey but about 80 percent of them cross in the dog made this phenomenon of homonymous hemianopsia much easier to detect by casual observation in the monkey than in the dog. As for Ferrier, Munk had this to say 126 : In my ªrst communication on the physiology of the cortex . . . I did not say anything about Ferrier’s work on the monkey because 70 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"there was nothing good to say about it . . . [Ferrier’s] statements and what followed from them . . . are worthless and gratuitous constructions since the operated animals were examined by Mr. Ferrier in quite an insufªcient manner . . . as the experiments show now I have said at that time rather too little than too much, Mr. Ferrier had not made one correct guess, all his statements have turned out to be wrong. About this time, Lister described his techniques for aseptic surgery, and soon after, Ferrier and Yeo used them in a new series of cortical lesions in monkeys. 127 Now the animals could be studied for several months after opera- tion, and Ferrier modiªed his previous views as to the permanence of the blindness after angular gyrus lesions 128 : Formerly, I localized the visual centres in the angular gyrus, to the exclusion of the occipital lobes. This being a partial truth is an error. . . . Complete destruction of the angular gyri on both sides causes for a time total blindness, succeeded by a lasting visual impairment in both eyes. The only lesion which causes complete and perma- nent blindness is total destruction of the occipital lobes and angular gyri on both sides. Despite this retreat, Ferrier (1886) still insisted that Munk’s conclusions on the location of the visual area were “entirely erroneous” and “vitiated by the occurrence of secondary encephalitis.” Ferrier’s observations on angular gyrus lesions actually anticipated subsequent work implicating the parietal cortex in visual functions. (See chapter 5.) Now Edward Albert Schäfer (1850–1935), professor of physiology at University College, London, and later at Edinburgh, entered the fray. In his ªrst experiments, carried out with his student Victor Horsley (coinventor of the stereotaxic instrument), they obtained results opposite from those of Ferrier, namely, more eye movements from stimulation of the occipital lobe than the angular gyrus, and much greater visual deªcits from occipital lesions than from 71 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"angular gyrus ones. 129 Then Schäfer carried out a series of further experiments with an American neurologist, Sanger Brown, in which the occipital lesions were more complete than anybody had made previously (ªgure 1.23), and they studied several of the animals in detail for several months. 130 They convincingly showed that total removal of the occipital lobe produced permanently blind animals, but only if the lesion extended on the ventral surface into the temporal lobe. Angular gyrus involvement, however, was neither necessary nor sufªcient to produce such blindness. They also failed, in several monkeys, to conªrm Ferrier’s claim that temporal lesions produce deafness. In explanation of this discrepancy, Schäfer suggested that Ferrier’s one monkey, indisputably deaf after a temporal lesion, must have been deaf preoperatively. 131 (One of Brown and Schäfer’s monkeys that retained its hearing after bilateral temporal lobectomy was a precursor to all subsequent work on the temporal lobe and vision, as discussed in chapter 5.) Ferrier and Schäfer continued to quarrel over whether the occipital lobe or the angular gyrus was the visual area (as well as whether the temporal lobe had an auditory center), both in journals and at various national and interna- tional meetings to which they brought their critical monkeys as demonstrations and to be examined by special committees. William James in his inºuential Principles of Psychology, after complaining of all this internecine warfare, came down unambiguously for a visual area in the occipital lobes. The battle was virtually over by then. Today, the bases for the apparent contradictions between Ferrier and Munk and Schäfer in the location of the visual area are understandable. From his descriptions and drawings (ªgure 1.22), it is clear that Ferrier removed the occipital lobes by an incision parallel to and about a half an inch or more posterior to the lunate sulcus. This site was chosen to make sure that the entire angular gyrus, his supposed visual center, was entirely spared. By his estimates this would remove “at least two thirds of the occipital lobes.” Today we know that such a lesion would leave intact the representation of about the peripheral thirty degrees of the visual ªeld in striate cortex and, more important, about a 72 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"few degrees of the entire representation of the lower half of the vertical meridian as well. 132 This is enough residual striate cortex to account for the visually guided behavior described by Ferrier after his occipital lesions. In contrast, Schäfer’s occipital lesions included not only all the striate cortex on the lateral surface by making his lobectomy through the ºoor of the lunate sulcus, but in the only animal totally and permanently blind, the bilateral lesion extended on the ventral surface far enough forward to have included all the buried striate cortex in the anterior calcarine ªssure. Munk provided less detailed information on the sites of his lesions, but they certainly included more of striate cortex than did Ferrier’s as well as at least some of the striate cortex in the calcarine sulcus on the medial surface. Striate Cortex Is Visual Cortex By the turn of the century, with the resolution of the Ferrier-Schäfer-Munk debate, anatomical, clinicopathological, and experimental data were converging Figure 1.23 The occipital lesions that Brown and Schäfer (1888) reported to cause blindness in macaques. The lesions include what we now know to be the entire representation of the visual ªeld in striate cortex, including both the rep- resentation of the fovea on the lateral surface (left, dorsal view) and of the ex- treme periphery in the far anterior of the calcarine sulcus (right, ventral view). 73 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"as to the identity of the visual area in the cortex of humans and monkeys. French anatomist Gratiolet’s (1854) identiªcation of the optic radiation (initially called Gratiolet’s radiation) proceeding from the geniculate to the posterior cortex was important as the ªrst demonstration of a sensory pathway extending to the cortex. The terminus of this visual pathway was more accurately delim- ited in the developmental myeloarchitectonic studies of Paul Flechsig (1847– 1929), professor at Leipzig, beginning in the 1870s. On the basis of the time of myelination, he divided human cortex into three zones: projection, myeli- nating at birth; intermediate, myelinating at one month; and terminal, myeli- nating later. The intermediate and terminal areas taken together he termed association cortex (ªgure 1.24). By 1896 Flechsig could identify the target of the visual radiations with the most posterior projection zone, and he realized it was the region of the stripe of Gennari. This region was soon named by G. Elliot Smith (1907) area striata. 133 (The concept of association cortex is discussed in chapter 5.) During the 1880s, studies of human brain damage by Hermann Wilbrand in Hamburg, M. Allan Starr at Columbia University, Henry Hun in Albany, and others were identifying blindness with damage to the occipital cortex. 134 Swedish neuropathologist Salomon Henschen collected over 160 cases of blind- ness and hemianopia after cortical lesions, which led him to identify the center of vision or cortical retina with the calcarine cortex and later, with all of striate cortex. Final experimental proof of the identiªcation of striate cortex with vision came with Minkowski’s behavioral and anatomical studies in animals. 135 The term “calcarine sulcus” was coined by T. H. Huxley (1825–1895) in the course of his bitter dispute with Richard Owen (1804–1992) over the hippocampus minor and man’s place in nature. (See chapter 4.) Owen claimed that only humans had a hippocampus minor, also known as the calcar avis. This structure is a ridge in the ºoor of the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle. To prove Owen wrong, Huxley and his allies set out to demonstrate its existence in a variety of primates. In the course of his study of the brain of the spider monkey for this purpose, Huxley (1861) provided the ªrst accurate description of the calcarine sulcus. He called it “calcarine” because its indentation into the lateral ventricle is what forms the calcar avis. 74 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Figure 1.24 Flechsig’s (1886) parcellation of the brain based on time of myelinization.

The great Arab visual scientist ibn al-Haythem (965–1039), known in Europe as Alhazen, had proposed a point-to-point projection of the retinal image onto the brain. 136 This idea was well known in Europe through the translation of his work, De Aspectibus, the standard textbook on physiological optics until Kepler and beyond. Depictions of the visual pathways from the Renaissance onward typically show a point-to-point pro- jection from eye to brain whether fanciful, as in Descartes (ªgure 1.25), or remarkably prescient, as in Newton (ªgure 1.20). This idea of a topographic projection seemed to have derived from the theoretical considerations of Al- hazen, rather than from any empirical evidence. Henschen, with his large number of cases, made a good start at empiri- cally decoding the topography of striate cortex. He correctly placed the repre- sentation of the upper visual ªeld in the lower bank of the calcarine sulcus and that of the lower one in the upper bank, but he reversed the center-periphery organization. This error was hardly surprising, given how large and diffuse many of his lesions were. As Glickstein and Whitteridge pointed out, it was the introduction of high-velocity bullets in the Russo-Japanese War that produced discrete lesions and often small entry and exit wounds, and thus made it possible to plot the locus of destroyed brain and correlate it with visual ªeld defects. In that war, Japanese ophthalmologist Tatsuji Inouye 137 produced the ªrst reason- ably accurate scheme of how the retina is mapped on striate cortex, including magniªcation of the representation of the fovea, which had not been observed previously. In World War I a large number of studies reported similar results, 138 but the most widely known is that of the British neurologist Sir Gordon Holmes, perhaps because his easy-to-understand schematic diagram was repro- duced in so many textbooks (ªgure 1.26). 139 Neurophysiology of Striate Cortex Begins In 1886 Adolf Beck began to work for his doctorate at the University of Kracow. 140 This was not only the period of intensive searching for sensory 76 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"centers in the cortex but also the beginning of electrophysiology. I. M. Seche- nov and his students had recorded electrical changes in the spinal cord and brain of a frog after stimulation of its leg. Beck then set out to use this method to try to localize the different sensory systems. He wrote: The question arises, are there any currents in the nervous centers of the brain and spinal cord? If so, are there changes in these currents during activity? And would the localizing of such changes Figure 1.25 Several aspects of Descartes’s theory of sensory processing are illustrated in this ªgure from his physiology textbook, Treatise on Man (1662). Light from the arrow en- ters the eye; the lens throws an inverted but topographically ordered image onto the ret- ina. The message then travels in the hollow optic nerves from each eye by way of the animal spirits to the central pineal gland, where the information from the two eyes is united in a corresponding fashion to yield a single upright image. Olfactory messages from the ºower also travel to the pineal body, but the strength of the visual signal (due to atten- tion) suppresses this olfactory input. 77 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"78 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"be of any help in demonstrating a state of activity of a focal nature in the central nervous system? After a series of experiments on frogs in which he thought he found spontaneous electrical activity, Beck turned to the cortex of rabbits and dogs. He placed pairs of electrodes in various cortical regions and presented visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli. He found an oscillating potential difference in the occipital region in the case of visual stimuli and used it to plot the extent of the visual cortex. As his thesis was in Polish, he published a three-page summary in German in the leading physiology journal of the day, Centralblatt für Physi- ologie. The importance of his demonstration of sensory evoked responses was immediately recognized; indeed, it stimulated a ºood of letters claiming prior- ity. One of these was from Richard Caton of Liverpool, who had published similar if less extensive experiments earlier. 141 However, not only had they gone unnoticed in Poland but they were totally ignored in England. The physiology establishment there thought Caton’s “weak electric currents” quite irrelevant. Beck went on to a distinguished academic career in Poland, including rectorship of the University of Lvov. When he was eighty, the Germans came to take him because he was a Jew. He swallowed the cyanide capsule supplied by his son, a doctor, and escaped the gas chamber. 142 In 1934, American psychologist S. Howard Bartley was the ªrst to carry out a systematic study of the visual evoked response of cerebral cortex and did so in rabbits. Then in the early 1940s, at Johns Hopkins, S. A. Talbot and Wade Marshall used visual evoked responses to carry out their pioneering studies of the visual topography of striate cortex ªrst in cats, then in macaques, and then, Figure 1.26 Representation of the retina in striate cortex according to Gordon Holmes (1918a): “A diagram of the probable representation of the different portions of the visual ªelds in the calcarine cortex. On the left is a drawing of the mesial surface of the left oc- cipital lobe with the lips of the calcarine separated so that its wall and ºoor are visible. The markings on the various portions of the visual cortex which is thus exposed corre- spond with those shown in the chart of the right half of the ªeld of vision. This diagram does not claim to be in any respect accurate; it is merely a scheme.” 79 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"with Clinton Woolsey and others, in a variety of other mammals. Particularly in gyrocephalic animals, these maps tended to be incomplete, since the macroelectrodes used conªned the recordings to the surface of the cortex. Subsequently, as described in the next section, using single-neuron recording, Daniel and Whitteridge in the monkey and Hubel and Wiesel in the cat, followed by many other studies, conªrmed and extended these electrophysi- ological maps of the visuotopic organization of striate cortex. 143 The Microelectrode Arrives; from Adrian to Kufºer The analysis of visual processing by single neurons begins with the work of E. A. Adrian. Indeed, virtually all of modern neurophysiology begins with Adrian. Among his other achievements were the establishment of the all-or-none law, the ªrst recording from single neurons, the concepts of labeled line and rate coding, the ªrst recording of spontaneous activity from cerebral and cerebellar cortex neurons, and conªrmation of the existence of brain waves, the electroencephalogram. 144 Titles and awards accrued: he was made a baron, was awarded the Order of Merit and the Nobel prize (1932), and was elected master of Trinity College and professor of physiology in the University of Cambridge, and president of the Royal Society and of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1927 he and Bryan Matthews recorded spike trains from the optic nerve of the conger eel and noted that the rate of ªring increased and the latency decreased as the intensity of the light increased. Following this up, H. Keffer Hartline dissected out single optic ªbers ªrst in Limulus, the horse- shoe crab, and then in the frog, where he distinguished on, off, and on-off responses for the ªrst time and introduced the concept of a visual receptive ªeld. 145 Hartline spent most of his career at the University of Pennsylvania and Rockefeller University, and shared the Nobel prize with George Wald and Ragnar Granit in 1967. The next major development was that of Stephen Kufºer, then at the John Hopkins University. Working with cats, he developed a technique for recording from the retina without having to remove the cornea and lens, as 80 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"had been done previously. This maintained the normal optics of the eye and enabled him to focus light on the portion of the retina that he was recording from. With these techniques he discovered the center-surround, on-off antago- nistic organization of the receptive ªelds of retinal ganglion cells. 146 Horace Barlow, who was working in Kufºer’s laboratory, had made similar observations in the frog earlier. He noted that this receptive ªeld organization made the cells much more sensitive to edges and contours than to diffuse light. (Barlow even called one of the class of cells he described a bug detector.) We now know that this receptive ªeld structure is fundamental to the organization of the entire visual system. It was the extension of Kufºer’s work from retina to cortex by Hubel and Wiesel that formed the basis of current study of visual cortex. Hubel and Wiesel In 1959, two physicians, David Hubel, a Canadian, and Torsten Wiesel, a Swede, came to Kufºer’s laboratory in Baltimore as postdoctoral fellows. Visual physiology, and indeed all of sensory physiology and psychology, were never the same again. Through the brilliant use of single-neuron physiology they revealed the functional architecture of striate cortex. This research promised the possibility of understanding perception in terms of neurons, and became the model for subsequent explorations of visual neurons inside and outside of striate cortex and for all of contemporary neurophysiology. Subsequently, Hubel and Wiesel moved to Harvard with Kufºer, and in 1981 they shared the Nobel prize with Roger Sperry. Their remarkable achievements that extended into visual neuroanatomy and neural development have been widely reviewed and will not concern us here except for two historical notes. 147 The ªrst is the description of their ªrst observation of an orientation selective neuron in a cat, perhaps the opening wedge in revealing the secrets of striate cortex 148 : We had been doing experiments for about a month . . . and were not getting very far; the cells simply would not respond to our spots and annuli. [The stimuli that had been used by Kufºer to reveal 81 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"the properties of retinal ganglion cells.] One day we made an especially stable recording. . . . For 3 or 4 hours we got absolutely nowhere. Then gradually we began to elicit some vague and inconsistent responses by stimulating somewhere in the mid- periphery of the retina. We were inserting [a] glass slide with a black spot into a [projecting ophthalmoscope] when suddenly over the audiomonitor the cell went off like a machine gun. After some fussing and ªddling we found out what was happening. The re- sponse had nothing to do with the black dot. As the glass slide was inserted its edge was casting onto the retina a faint but sharp shadow, a straight dark line on a light background. That was what the cell wanted, and it wanted it, moreover, in just one narrow range of orientations. A few years later they realized that cells with similar orientation selectivity and cells with similar ocular dominance were arranged in orientation and ocular dominance columns, respectively. This discovery must have been facilitated by the proximity at Hopkins of Vernon Mountcastle, who had recently discovered columnar organization in somatosensory cortex. 149 The second historical point is that Hubel and Wiesel were by no means the ªrst to record from single neurons in striate cortex. In 1952 the Freiburg group starring R. Jung, G. Baumgartener, O. Creutzfeldt, and O. J. Grusser had begun a systematic program of research on the visual activity of single neurons in striate cortex of the cat. 150 Although their techniques were techni- cally sophisticated, their central ªnding for about the ªrst ten years was actually that striate neurons showed little visual responsiveness: 50 percent of the many cells sampled showed no responses, and the responses of many of the others, by subsequent standards, were rather feeble. As Jung later candidly admitted, a primary reason for their failure to activate striate cells was that their elaborate apparatus (which took two years to build) was too inºexible to vary the orientation of the visual stimulus. As he put it, “We missed the orientation speciªcity . . . [because of ] . . . premature quantiªcation and a too rigid methodological restriction.” 151 82 Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"This completes our story of research on striate cortex.

As in The Yellow Emperor’s Classic, compiled from earlier sources in the third century BCE (Huang Ti, 1949; Porkert, 1974). On the other hand, in vol. 5, pt. 5 of his monumental Science and Civilization in China, Joseph Needham (1983) tells us “. . . the brain was always an organ of cardinal importance in Taoist anatomy and physiology,” which he footnotes thus: “Exactly what its functions were considered to be is not so easy to say. We shall return to all these matters in sect. 43 on physiology in Vol. 6 . . .” Needham died in 1995 as vol. 6, pt. 3 containing sect. 42 went to press. Whether his successors will fulªll his promise to discuss the importance of the brain remains to be seen. The brain is mentioned often in the context of Taoist sexual techniques (Needham, 1983; Chang, 1977; Van Gulik, 1961; Ware, 1966). Withholding ejaculation was thought to enable the semen to be rerouted up the spinal cord to “nourish” and “repair” the brain. (The Taoist adept apparently could achieve orgasm without ejaculation.) Conserving semen was believed to lead to long life or even immortality, as in this Taoist saying provided by Needham (1983): who wishes life unending to attain must raise the essence to restore the brain. 83 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"15.

Many of them arrived with little knowledge of Latin, Italian, or any aspect of life and culture outside of the shtetels and ghettos.

Extromission holds that something streams out of the eye and interacts with the seen object (e.g., Euclid). More complicated interactive formulations (e.g., Aristotle) were also held among the Greek visual scientist-phi- losophers (Theophrastus, 1917; Lindberg 1976). Today, most children and many adults still hold extromission views of vision (Winer and Cottrell, 1966). 108. Von Helmholtz, 1863. 109. In 1845 Von Helmholtz, du Bois-Reymond, and two other students of Müller, Carl Ludwig and Ernst Brucke (Freud’s teacher), all of whom later became famous as founders of modern physiology, got together to issue a manifesto against vitalism, the doctrine that life cannot be reduced to physics and chemistry. Perhaps not coincidentally, Müller was the last great (mainstream) biologist who was a vitalist. Their manifesto declared, “No other forces than common physical chemical ones are active within the organism,” and they proceeded to support this reductionism in every branch of physiology (Coleman, 1971, particularly, the bibliography; Boring, 1950). 110.

It did not seem to be noticed in Europe, although it 87 From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"was published in toto in an American medical journal at the time (Bell, 1812). A long and bitter priority controversy arose between Bell and the great French physiologist Francois Magendie (1783–1855) over the discovery of the law of spinal roots (i.e., that ventral spinal roots are motor and dorsal ones sensory). In fact, (a) Bell proposed only the sensory functions of the dorsal roots, (b) there is no reason to believe that Magendie knew of Bell’s claims before he carried out and published his own experiments, and (c) both halves of the law were experimentally demonstrated by Magendie, whereas Bell’s consideration of the functions of the dorsal roots were largely anatomically based.

A parallel to the neglect of Panizza’s work because it was ahead of its time was the fate of Gregor Mendel’s (1866) paper on inheritance in peas, which although published in an equally obscure journal, also passed into the major libraries and across the desks of the biology savants of the day, to whom it apparently had no meaning. The difference was that when Tamburini (1880) rediscovered Panizza, Munk had already gone beyond him. In contrast, when Mendel was rediscovered by De Vries in about 1900, Mendel’s work was still original and important (Mayr, 1982). 117. Ferrier, 1873, 1875a. In the beginning Ferrier was very stingy in giving Fritsch and Hitzig credit for their methods and discoveries. Thus, when he submitted his paper (Ferrier, 1875b) to the prestigious Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, one of the referees, Michael Foster, objected to his failure to credit adequately Fritsch and Hitzig. T. H. Huxley was then called in as a third referee “for the purpose of ascertaining . . . whether Dr. Ferrier has or has not done sufªcient justice to the labors of his predecessors” (Royal Society archives, RR.7.302).

Throughout most of his life he had a consuming interest in the structure and function of the eye, brain, and nervous system, and in a variety of visual phenomena such as illusions, contrast, and color. 2–6 Although he was initially led to these subjects by his painting or, as he put it, “the science of painting,” they soon became obsessions in their own right. Leonardo (1452–1519) was the ªrst great medical illustrator. 7–10 His are the earliest surviving naturalistic drawings of the internal structure of the human body. Furthermore, he introduced a number of powerful techniques for por- traying anatomical structures such as the use of transparencies, cross sections, exploded ªgures, and three-dimensional shading. 11 Today, his anatomical draw- ings continue to attract huge crowds, although most are unaware of the frequent errors they contain and their dependence on traditional authority. This chapter concerns Leonardo’s drawings of the nervous system. First, I consider the background of neuroanatomy in ªfteenth-century Europe, then the development of some of Leonardo’s ideas on the brain and the eye, and ªnally, the impact of this work. Leonardo may be the paradigmatic Renaissance"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"genius with ideas about such things as airplanes, submarines, machine guns, and bicycles that were not to be realized until the twentieth century. However, in his neuroscience he begins solidly in the Middle Ages, blinded, or at least blinkered, by traditional dogma. Only gradually, and only partially, does he free himself from a “debased medieval Aristotelianism and a corrupted Galenism” 12 and begin to draw with accuracy the open body before him. Neuroanatomy in the Fifteenth Century After the death of Galen in 199, anatomical dissection for either scientiªc or medical reasons was absent in both Europe and Islam for over a thousand years. It began again in thirteenth-century Italy, ªrst for forensic purposes and then as a way of illustrating Galen’s anatomical works for medical students. 17 Galen, however, did not become available in direct translation until the sixteenth century; before then his work was presented by Avicenna and other Arab scientists who never practiced dissection themselves. Not only were the ac- counts of Galen’s work indirect, but Galen never mentioned that his anatomical descriptions were almost always based on nonhumans, a fact that was not realized until recently. Galen’s anatomy is remarkably accurate when applied to the monkey or ox, his usual subjects, but not to humans. 18, 19 Box 2.1 Leonardo’s Drawings and Notes Over 5,000 sheets of drawings and notes by Leonardo on a fantastic range of subjects have survived and are scattered in libraries around the world. In spite of his plans for a number of books, including one on anatomy, none of his drawings or texts were published until long after his death. By 1690 virtually all of his extant anatomical drawings found their way to the Royal Library in Windsor Castle, including the originals of ªgures 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8. They are here referred to by the numbers assigned by Clark, 13 e.g., W19097. Leonardo’s surviving texts, except for the recently discovered Madrid codices, 14 have been translated into English and arranged by Richter 15 and, easier to use, MacCurdy. 16 94 Chapter 2"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The ªrst European anatomy textbook was the forty-page Anothomia of Mondino de’ Luzzi (Mundinus) written in 1316. It was essentially a dissection guide for learning Arab accounts of Galen’s words, not for learning about the actual body. Mondino’s work went through many manuscript editions before it was ªnally printed in 1478, but remained unillustrated until an edition of 1521. 20–22 It was known to Leonardo at the beginning of his dissections (around 1490) and was an important source of anatomical nomenclature for him. 23–26 An earlier medieval tradition of drawing diagrams of the human body in a froglike posture was used to represent the major organs or venisection sites. However, none of the extant ones were drawn from actual dissections, but are symbolic representations of general Greek or Arab ideas about the body, its diseases, and their treatment. 27–29 Accurate illustrations of the body beneath the skin began not in medical schools but in the workshops of Renaissance artists. With the growth of naturalism, artists desired more accurate knowledge of the surface musculature and used the scalpel on human cadavers to obtain it. Furthermore, there seems to have been considerable interaction between Italian Renaissance artists and medical workers. Both physicians and painters belonged to and were regulated by the Guild of Physicians and Apothecaries, as was the case for surgeons, undertakers, distillers, booksellers, and silk merchants. Painters bought their pigments at the same shops where doctors bought their medicines, and human dissections were usually open to the public. 30–33 Among the early artists who dissected human bodies to gain a more accurate view of the superªcial muscles were Leonardo’s teacher Verrocchio, who worked on a sculpture of the satyr Marsyas who was ºayed alive for his overambition, and Verrocchio’s neighbor Antoni Pollaiuolo, who displayed his anatomical knowledge particularly in his Martyrdom of St. Sebastian. Later, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Dürer all left drawings of their dissections; Dürer actually “appropriated” some of Leonardo’s anatomical drawings. Leonardo’s interest in anatomy presumably also began as an aid to painting, but he alone among Renaissance artists went far deeper than the appearance of the surface musculature. 34–39 95 Leonardo da Vinci on the Brain and Eye"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Sexual Intercourse One of Leonardo’s earliest anatomical drawings (ca. 1493) and one of the ªrst to be published, in 1795, depicted sexual intercourse (ªgure 2.2). 40, 41 It is headed, “I display to men the origin of their . . . cause of existence,” 42 and consists of a contradictory collection of traditional views quite unencumbered by actual observations. Avicenna believed that semen, carrying the soul of the future person, came from the spinal cord, a view he presumably obtained from the Hippocratic work On Generation. The idea that semen derives from the brain and travels down the spinal cord is also found in Alcmaeon and other presocratic natural philosophers. 43 To accommodate this view, Leonardo drew a hollow nerve from the spinal cord to the upper of two canals in the penis. In contrast, Galen 44 argued that sperm came from the testes; to accommodate that view, Leonardo drew a tube from the testes to the lower canal, which was thought to be used for the passage of urine as well as semen. The two canals are shown more clearly in the two drawings in the bottom left. Both the cervix and the uterus are shown expanded, following Avicenna, who believed both structures opened up during intercourse. Note the large sperm entering the (penislike?) open cervix. There is a nerve from the uterus to the breast, illustrating the belief that in pregnancy the “retained menses” is carried to the breast and there stimulates the formation of milk. Another nerve runs from the testes to the heart, following Aristotle’s theory of the heart as the center of sensation, a view subsequently abandoned by Leonardo and never held by Galen or most classical physician-philosophers. 45 This early drawing is typical in that it serves both as an uncritical “review of the literature” and as a program for investigation. Thus, Leonardo wrote beside the drawing: Note what the testicles have to do with coition and the sperm. And how the foetus breathes and how it is nourished by the umbilical cord, and why one soul governs two bodies . . . and why a child of eight months does not live. . . . How the testicles are the source of ardor. 96 Chapter 2"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Figure 2.2 Sexual intercourse.

Syphilis had become widespread in Italy about this time, and at the bottom of the page Leonardo noted: “Through these ªgures will be demon- strated the cause of many dangers of ulcers and diseases.” He returned to the subject in subsequent scattered notes. On sexual intercourse he wrote: The act of coitus and the parts employed therein are so repulsive that if it were not for the beauty of the faces and the adornments of the actions and the frantic state of mind, nature would lose the human species. (W19009r) . . . The woman commonly has a desire quite the opposite of that of a man. That is, the woman likes the size of the genital member of the man to be as large as possible, and the man desires the opposite in the genital member of the woman, so that neither one nor the other ever attains his interest because Nature, who cannot be blamed, has so provided because of parturition. (W19101r) He did answer his question on the role of the “testicles in ardour” 46 : Testicles . . . contain in themselves ardour, that is, they are the augmenters of the animosity and ferocity of the animals; and ex- perience shows us this clearly in the castrated animals, of which one sees the bull, the boar, the ram and the cock, very ªerce animals, which after having been deprived of these testicles remain very cowardly.

It seems therefore that this creature has often a life and intelligence separate from the man and it would appear that the man is in the wrong in being ashamed to give it a name or exhibit it . . . An Early Figure Showing the Ventricular Theory As in other areas of his investigations, Leonardo’s understanding of the brain shows progression over the years. He begins with uncritical notes from con- temporary sources and, ªnding them unsatisfactory, moves on to critical inquiry and then, sometimes, to new insights. Another one of Leonardo’s earliest anatomical drawings shows the visual input to the brain (ªgure 2.3) It is a curious and uncritical amalgam of Arabic and medieval sources, with a minor discovery and some new techniques thrown in. 53–56 The terms for the layers from hair to brain are from Avicenna through Mondino’s text; in two cases the Arabic terms are still in use today—dura mater Box 2.2 Leonardo’s Handwriting Leonardo’s mirror writing is very hard to decipher and not only because it is mirror writing. He had his own peculiar orthography that changed over time, he arbitrarily fused and divided words, he used no punctuation, and he had his own set of abbreviations and symbols. 49 The mirror writing presumably reºected that he was left-handed and had been taught as a child to write with his right hand rather than any “secret code.” 50 He did protect many of his inventions by introducing an intentional error into his plans such as an extra cogwheel. 51, 52 99 Leonardo da Vinci on the Brain and Eye"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Figure 2.3 An early (ca. 1490) drawing of the eye and cerebral ventricles of the brain that uncritically combines Greek, Arab, and medieval views.

The depictions of the dura and pia extending to sheath the optic nerve and the eyeball (center and lower right) are again derived from Avicenna. The lens or crystalline humor is shown central, as it is in virtually all Arab and European drawings until Felix Platter (1603), the ªrst to understand its role as a lens projecting the image onto a sensitive retina. 57, 58 The lens is shown as round, although Galen and most of the Arab authorities on the eye, but not many medieval writers, had described it more correctly. 59, 60 Leonardo must have been uncertain about the shape of the crystalline humor, because later, in his unpublished monograph on vision, 61 he suggested and diagrammed a method for determining the shape and location of the lens: In the anatomy of the eye in order to see the inside well without spilling its humour one should place the whole eye in white of egg, make it boil, and become solid, cutting the egg and the eye transversely in order that none of the middle portion may be poured out. He never carried out this idea, as reºected in his continuing to draw the crystalline humor (lens) round and his reminder to himself to “study the anatomy of different eyes.” 62 The portrayal of the ventricles as three connected spheres is not derived from Avicenna or Galen, or any other classical text. Galen knew that the ªrst or lateral ventricles are paired, and he provided an accurate account of the morphology of all four cerebral ventricles on the basis of his dissections of the ox. 63, 64 Rather than following Galen, Leonardo depicted three circular ventri- cles according to the widespread medieval theory of the ventricular localization of psychological function. In the basic form of the theory, the faculties of the mind (derived from Aristotle) were distributed among the spaces within the brain (derived from those described by Galen). The lateral ventricles were collapsed into one space, the ªrst cell or small room. This received input from all the sense organs and was the site of the sensus communis, or common sense, which integrated across the modalities. The sensations yielded images, and thus, 101 Leonardo da Vinci on the Brain and Eye"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"the ªrst cell was the seat of fantasy and imagination as well. The second or middle cell was the site of cognitive processes, reasoning, judgment, and thought. The third cell or ventricle was the site of memory. (For a discussion of the origins, variations, and longevity of the ventricular doctrine, see chapter 1 and ªgure 1.7.) In the bottom ªgure Leonardo reºects the standard medieval concept of the location of common sense in the ªrst ventricle by showing input to it from the eyes and ears. Note the absence of the optic chiasm, although it had been noted by Aristotle, discussed in detail by Galen, and diagrammed repeatedly in the Arab literature, including in Alhazen’s De Aspectibus, which was the standard textbook on optics in Europe until Kepler in the sixteenth century (see ªgure 1.6). 65–68 The new and correct anatomical feature, if somewhat exaggerated, is the frontal sinus, shown above the eye in the central and lower left ªgures. The three ways of labeling the layers of the scalp and the “unhinging” of the skull in the lower right drawing are apparently new illustration techniques. Injecting Wax to Reveal the Ventricles A few years later, Leonardo returned to the ventricles with brilliant success, using the sculptural technique of wax injection to reveal their shape (ªgure 2.4). As he instructed 69 : Make two vent-holes in the horns of the great ventricles, and insert melted wax with a syringe, making a hole in the ventricle of the memoria and through such a hole ªll the three ventricles of the brain. Then, when the wax has set, take away the brain and you will see the shape of the ventricles. But ªrst put narrow tubes into the vents so that the air which is in these ventricles can escape and make room for the wax which enters into the ventricles. The shortcomings of his wax cast of the lateral ventricles seen in ªgure 2.4 were probably due to the absence of air vents in the posterior horns and 102 Chapter 2"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"the use of an unpreserved brain. This method for revealing the shape of internal biological cavities was not used again until Frederick Ruysch in the eighteenth century, an achievement the French Academy of Science thought equal to Newton’s. 70 The ventral view shows a rete mirabile, a vascular structure found in the ox, where Galen described it, but not in humans. The sulcal pattern is also that of an ox, whereas the location of the cerebellum and the form of the ventricles are closer to that of a human brain. Perhaps Leonardo injected both species and this is a composite ªgure. 71 Figure 2.4 The ventricles based on wax injection and (lower) the rete mirable, ca. 1504–1507. W19127r 103 Leonardo da Vinci on the Brain and Eye"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"As Leonardo began to study the brain itself, his attribution of functions to the ventricles became somewhat contradictory and was eventually aban- doned. In the period of this drawing, he had been dissecting the cranial nerves and observed that the trigeminal and auditory nerves entered the central portion of the brain rather than the anterior portion. Therefore, in contrast to tradition and his previous drawing (ªgure 2.3), he put the common sense in the middle ventricle, now the third ventricle since the anterior ventricle was paired. The auditory and trigeminal inputs to the middle ventricle are diagrammed in the small horizontal section in the middle right of ªgure 2.5. The visual input still went to the ªrst ventricle before proceeding to the common sense. Now he put intellect and imprensiva into the ªrst ventricle. Leonardo’s placement of intellect at the target of the optic nerves underlies the dominant role he gave to this sense. By “imprensiva,” a term never used before or after Leonardo, he meant something like sensory processing or sensation. Although the imprensiva is never described as only visual, note that in this ªgure it receives only visual input. Leonardo again contradicts his idea that it initially processes all the senses by having the tactile input come to the fourth ventricle: Since we have clearly seen that the fourth ventricle is at the end of the medulla where all the nerves which provide the sense of touch come together, we can conclude that the sense of touch passes to this ventricle. (W19127r) He never resolved these tensions between his anatomy and his functional localizations, and there is little effort to relate the sensory input to the ventricles in later drawings (e.g., ªgures 2.4 and 2.5). He did return to the medulla in the only experiment that he is known to have carried out on a living animal (he was an antivivisectionist and a vegetarian 72, 73 ): The frog suddenly dies when its spinal medulla is perforated. . . . It seems therefore that here lies the foundations of motion and life.

Anatomical drawings did not surpass the clarity of these for centuries. 75, 76 Galen had described only seven cranial nerves, including the oculomotor but neither the trochlear nor the abducens. As shown in ªgure 2.5 and rather more clearly in ªgure 2.6, Leonardo’s account of the cranial nerves is an advance over Galen. Here the optic chiasm is illustrated and the olfactory nerves are shown above it. The other nerves appear to be the oculomotor, the abducens, and the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal, 77, 78 although one observer contends that the latter is the trochlear. 79 Typically, the cranial nerve sheets contain ambitious programs for future research 80 : • Draw the nerves which move the eyes in any direction, and its muscles; and do the same with their eyelids, and with the eyebrows, nostrils, cheeks and lips, and everything that moves in a man’s face. • Let the whole ramiªcation of the vessels which serve the brain be made ªrst by itself, separated from the nerves, and then another combined with the nerves.

And I made an anatomy of him in order to see the cause of so sweet a death. This I found to be a fainting away through lack of blood to the artery which nourishes the heart, and other parts below it, which I found very dry, thin and withered. This anatomy I described very diligently and with great ease owing to the absence of fat and humors which greatly hinder the recognition of the parts. (W19027v) Galen had described in accurate detail the right and left branches of the vagus nerve, known in Leonardo’s time as the reversive nerve. 81 Figure 2.7 shows the right branch innervating the larynx, trachea, esophagus, and stomach. Leonardo’s interest in the vagus may have been stimulated by Galen’s brilliant demonstration that cutting the innervation of the larynx by the recurrent branch of the vagus eliminated vocalization in the pig. (See the bottom panel of ªgure 1.5.) In the adjacent text Leonardo mentions that the left nerve may innervate the heart. This gives him the occasion to withdraw his earlier Aristotelian belief that the heart is the beginning of life (W19034v): The heart is not the beginning of life but is a vessel made of dense muscle viviªed and nourished by an artery and vein as are the other muscles. It is true that the blood and the artery which purges itself in it are the life and nourishment of the other muscles. The rest of the text is mostly questions for future research: Note in what part the left reversive nerve turns and what ofªce it serves. And note the substance of the brain whether it is softer or denser above the origin of the nerve than in other parts. [According to Galen the sensory nerves and the sensory parts of the brain were softer and the motor nerves and the motor parts of the brain were 109 Leonardo da Vinci on the Brain and Eye"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"harder. Thus, Leonardo is asking whether the nerve is sensory or motor]. Observe in what way the reversive nerves give sensation to the rings of the trachea and what are the muscles which give movement to the rings to produce a deep, medium or shrill voice. Count the rings of the trachea. Leonardo is unique up to his time and beyond for constantly counting and measuring in his anatomical studies. Figure 2.8, also from the centenarian, shows the distribution of the median and ulnar nerves to the palmar aspect of the hand. Unlike the more complicated situation in ªgure 2.7, this drawing is very accurate. Optics of the Eye Leonardo wrote extensively about light, vision, and the optics of the eye in both an unpublished monograph and in many scattered notes and drawings. 82–86 Although the camera obscura or pinhole camera had been known since late antiquity and was used by Renaissance artists, Leonardo was the ªrst to note its similarity to the eye. 87, 88 He vehemently rejected the implication of this similarity, however; namely, that an inverted image was projected onto the back of the eye and conveyed to the brain. To avoid this unacceptable inversion he tried to develop an optical scheme in which the image was inverted twice in the eye, thereby ending up veridical and ready to be transported to the brain. In fact, he developed about eight such schemes, 89, 90 two of which are shown in ªgure 2.9. Leonardo actually proposed to build a model to test the lower optical arrangement with his own eye at the site of the optic nerve head of the model. It is ironic that Leonardo, who presumably easily read his own left-right reversed writing, found it inconceivable that the brain could interpret an inverted image. One hundred years later, Kepler was the ªrst to accept that the image on the black of the eye was indeed inverted since “geometrical laws 110 Chapter 2"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Figure 2.8 The median and ulnar nerves of the hand, ca. 1504–1509.

However, del Torre died in 1511, before their text was ªnished (or, as far as we know, started). Leonardo’s anatomical drawings had to wait over 200 years for publication. A number of his contemporaries, however, are known to have seen and admired them. 92 Dürer copied several of them, as did several less well-known artists. 93, 94 Leonardo’s fame as an artist-anatomist spread through- out northern Italy, and today he is credited with “spearheading the new creative anatomy,” 95 and developing the naturalistic techniques that were made use of by Vesalius (1514–1564) and led to the birth of modern anatomy. 96–99 Box 2.4 Leonardo on the Difªculties of Anatomy “And if you have a love for such [anatomical] things, you will perhaps be hindered by your stomach, and if this does not prevent you, you may perhaps be deterred by the fear of living during the night in the company of quartered and ºayed corpses, horrible to see.

Soon after his death, his followers founded the Swedenborgian Church of the New Jerusalem that continues today as an active Protestant sect. Before his visions began, Swedenborg’s interest in the soul led him to study its housing in the brain, and he wrote a set of extraordinary treatises on brain function. These works contained a number of ideas that anticipated modern discoveries by over 100 years. For example, he posited a crucial role of the cerebral cortex in sensory, motor, and cognitive functions, and this during a period in which the cortex was denied any signiªcant functions at all. He even had something very akin to a neuron doctrine, although actual neurons had not been described. Yet, his writings on the brain had no impact on the development of neuroscience. This chapter begins by reviewing the knowledge of the brain in Sweden- borg’s time. I then consider his life, his insights into brain function, and the sources of these ideas. I conclude with his inºuence on the arts and sciences."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Neuroscience in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries From the revival of anatomical investigation by Andreas Vesalius of Padua in the sixteenth century until the middle of the nineteenth century, the cerebral cortex was usually considered of little interest. This is indicated by its very name, cortex, Latin for “rind.” Vesalius himself thought the function of the cortical convolutions was to allow the blood vessels to bring nutriment to the deeper parts of the brain 1 : . . . nature impressed those sinuous foldings throughout the sub- stance of the brain, so that the thin membrane, folded with numer- ous vessels, could insert itself into the substance of the brain and so to make the cerebral vessels safe by guiding them and so very dexterously administer nourishment. The ªrst person to examine the cortex microscopically was Marcello Malpighi (1628–1694), professor in Bologna. He saw it as made up of little glands or globules with attached ªbers (see ªgure 1.11) 2 : I have discovered in the brain of higher sanguinous animals that the cortex is formed from a mass of very minute glands. These are found in the cerebral gyri which are like tiny intestines and in which the white roots of the nerves terminate or, if you prefer, from which they originate . . . [the globules] are of an oval ªgure . . . [their] inner portion puts forth a white nervous ªbre . . . the white medullary substance of the brain being in fact produced by the connection and fasciculation of many of these. Similar globules or glandules were also reported by Leewenhoek and other subsequent microscopists. 3 Some historians once thought these pioneers were actually observing cortical pyramidal cells. 4 At least in the case of Malpighi, however, artifacts are now considered a more likely possibility, since Malpighi 120 Chapter 3"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"reported that the globules were more prominent in boiled than fresh tissue. Furthermore, artifacts that look just like Malpighi’s globules have been pro- duced by using the methods and instruments he described in detail. 5, 6 Malpighi’s view of the brain as a glandular organ was a common one in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Perhaps a reason for its popularity was that it was consistent with the still persisting views of Aristotle that the brain was a cooling organ, and of the Hippocratic doctors that it was the source of phlegm. 7, 8 The only major ªgure to attribute any importance to the cerebral cortex was Thomas Willis (1621–1675), professor of natural philosophy at Oxford and author of the ªrst monograph on brain anatomy and physiology 9 (see ªgure 1.12). Although Willis denied both sensory and motor function to the cerebral cortex, he did attribute to it such higher functions as imagination and memory. However, even this interest in the cerebral cortex dissipated by the end of the seventeenth century. In the middle of the eighteenth century, physiology was dominated by Albrecht von Haller, professor at Tubingen and later Bern, who was also famous as a botanist, poet, novelist, and politician. Using animals, he tested the “sen- sibility” of various brain structures with mechanical stimuli such as picking with a scalpel, puncturing with a needle, and pinching with forceps, as well as with chemical stimuli such as silver nitrate, sulfuric acid, and alcohol. With these methods he found the cortex completely insensitive. In contrast, he reported the white matter and subcortical structures such as the thalamus and medulla to be highly sensitive; their stimulation, he said, produced expressions of pain, attempts of the animal to escape, or convulsions. 10 Haller’s ideas on the insensitivity of cortex and the sensitivity of other brain structures were repeatedly conªrmed by the experiments of his students, such as J. G. Zinn of “zonule of Zinn” fame, professor of medicine at Gottin- gen. Describing one such study, Zinn wrote 11 : Having cut out a small circular piece of the cranium of a dog with a trephine . . . I pierced the exposed dura mater, touched it with a blade of a scalpel, and poured a solution of mercury sublimate on 121 Emanuel Swedenborg"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"it; the animal, however, gave no signs of pain and suffered no convulsions. Since I thought the dog ought to have become apo- plectic, I irritated the reºected skin and he showed that he felt pain by giving out a loud cry. . . . Having incised the dura mater, I cut the cortex into pieces, pierced it, irritated it, but the animal showed no sign of pain. In contrast, when he thrust an instrument through the skull, corpus callosum, and corpus striatum to the base of the brain, as conªrmed at autopsy, the dog “howled pitifully . . . vomited repeatedly . . . and died the next day.” From observations such as these Haller and his followers concluded that all parts of the cortex were equivalent and were involved in neither sensation nor movement. In summary, during Swedenborg’s time, the cerebral cortex was consid- ered an insensitive rind with no sensory, motor, or higher functions. Swedenborg’s Life Emanuel Swedenborg was born in Stockholm in 1688 of a wealthy mining family that provided him with a lifelong private income. His father was professor of theology at Uppsala, a famous hymn writer, and later a bishop. Swedenborg studied philosophy at Uppsala, but became increasingly involved in science and technology. Among his unrealized schemes were ones for airplanes, submarines, and machine guns. (Do all visionaries dream of ºying through the sky, swimming beneath the sea, and efªciently wiping out their enemies, or do Leonardo and Swedenborg have something special in common?) He served on the Board of Mines and made a number of substantial contribu- tions to astronomy, geology, metallurgy, paleontology, and physics. 12–17 In the 1740s, inspired by studying Newton, Swedenborg began seeking mathematical and mechanical explanations of the origin and nature of the physical and biological universes. He developed a theory of the origin of planets similar to the later and apparently independent ones of Kant and Laplace. He 122 Chapter 3"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"then turned to the problem of the nature of the soul and its relation to the body. This led him to seek the site of the soul in the body and thus to the study of the brain itself 18 : I have pursued this [brain] anatomy solely for the purpose of discovering the soul. If I shall have furnished anything of use to the anatomic or medical world it will be gratifying, but still more so if I shall have thrown any light upon the discovery of the soul. He read widely about the brain in the biological and medical literature of the day, and traveled for extended periods to various countries of western Europe. His ªrst published writing on the brain was in his Oeconomia Regni Animalis of 1740, which was later translated into English as The Economy of the Animal Kingdom. 19 By “regni animali” he meant kingdom of the anima or soul; he considered this kingdom or realm to be the human body and, particularly, the brain. By “oeconomia” he meant organization. Thus a better translation of his title might be Organization of the Body or, less literally, The Biological Bases of the Soul. He also dealt with the brain and sense organs in his second major biological work, Regnum Animale, 20 published a few years later. Again, “ani- male” here means pertaining to the soul. In 1743 Swedenborg’s religious visions began and for the rest of his life he concentrated his energies on religion and spiritual matters. The resulting huge corpus of theological and psychic writings later formed the basis of the Swedenborgian Church. He never returned to his interest in the brain, and much of his writing on the topic remained unpublished in his lifetime. Various religious disputes led him to exile in London, where he died at the age of 83. 21–24 In the nineteenth century a number of Swedenborg’s manuscripts on the brain and sense organs were found by R. L. Tafel in the library of the Swedish Academy of Sciences 25 and published, sometimes ªrst in Latin and then in English. The most important of these, The Brain, appeared in 1882 and 1887. 26 123 Emanuel Swedenborg"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Further translations of Swedenborg’s unpublished writings on the brain ap- peared in the twentieth century, but they were mostly earlier drafts of material already published. 27–29 Views on the Cerebral Cortex At the very beginning of his biological works Swedenborg announces that his writings will be based primarily on the work of others 30 : Here and there I have taken the liberty to throw in the results of my experience, but only sparingly . . . I deemed it best to make use of the facts supplied by others . . . I laid aside my instruments, and restraining my desire for making observations, determined to rely rather on the researches of others than to trust my own. In fact, he very rarely does “throw in” the results of his own work. He provides only a single ªgure of one of his own brain dissections, that of a drake, 31 and almost no accounts of any of his own experiments or observations. He begins each section of his biological works with an extensive set of quotations from previous writings on the subject. (These are a marvelous boon for those of us who cannot read medical Latin.) In the next section, entitled “Analysis” or “Induction,” he proceeds to weave his own theory of biological structure and function. Such a section from The Economy of the Animal Kingdom on “The Cortical Substance of the Brain” characteristically begins, “From the forgoing experience we infer, that the cortex is the principal substance of the brain.” In fact, his inference was actually a radical and total departure from the contemporary literature he had just reviewed. Swedenborg then proposed that the cerebral cortex was the most important substance in the brain for sensation, movement, and cognition 32 : From the anatomy of the brain it follows that the brain is a sensorium commune with respect to its cortical substance . . . since to it are referred the impressions of the external sense organs as if 124 Chapter 3"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"to their one and only internal centre. . . . The cortical substance is also the motorium commune voluntarium for whatever actions are mediated by the nerves and muscles are determined beforehand by the will, that is, by the cortex. This must be taken as a general principle, that the cortical substance . . . imparts life, that is sensation, perception, under- standing and will; and it imparts motion, that is the power of acting in agreement with will and with nature . . . Central to his brain theory were the cortical globules or glandules de- scribed by Malpighi and his successors (see chapter 1 and ªgure 1.11). In an extraordinary anticipation of the neuron doctrine, Swedenborg suggested that these globules or, as he sometimes called them “cerebellula” (little brains), were functionally independent units that were connected to each other by way of threadlike ªbers. These ªbers also ran through the white matter and medulla down to the spinal cord, and then by way of the peripheral nerves to various parts of the body. The operations of these cerebellula, he maintained, were the basis of sensation, mentation, and movement. 33 From each cortical gland proceeds a single . . . nerve ªber; this is carried down into the body, in order that it may take hold of some part of a sensation, or produce some action . . . Sensory and Motor Functions of the Cortex Whereas Descartes projected sensory messages to the walls of the ventricle and Willis brought them to the thalamus, Swedenborg thought they terminated in the cerebral cortex, “the seat wherein sensation ªnally ceases,” speciªcally in the cortical cerebellula 34 : The external sensations do not travel to any point beyond the cortical cerebellula. This is clear since these are the origin of the nerve ªbers. 125 Emanuel Swedenborg"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"In addition, 35 The organ of sight is the eye, while the organ of internal sight is the cortical gland. He even outlined the pathway from each sense organ to the cortex, a totally unprecedented view and one that was not to reappear until well into the nineteenth century 36 : . . . the visual rays ºow, by means of the optic nerve, into the thalami nervorum opticorum, and are thence diffused in all direc- tions over the cortex. . . . Also the subtle touches of the olfactory membrane lining the labyrinthine cavities of the nares and the consequent subtle transformation or modiªcations . . . do not ter- minate until they arrive . . . in the cortical circumstance. Again the modulations of air, striking upon the delicate . . . internal ear allow themselves to be carried to the medulla and thence toward the supreme cortex. . . . Further, that the tremors excited by the touch of angular bodies in the papillary ºesh of the tongue, spread them- selves with the sense of taste in a similar manner by their nerves, toward . . . the cortical substance. And that every ruder touch whatever springs up from the surface of the whole, through the medium of the nerves into the medulla spinalis or medulla oblon- gata, and so into the highly active cineritious [grey] substance and the circumambient cortex of the brain. He seemed unclear about whether there were discrete cortical areas for every sense or whether all the senses went to the same cortical region, as shown in the following contradictory passages from the same work: It is clear from examining the brain that the cortical substances are so wisely arranged as to correspond exactly to every external sen- 126 Chapter 3"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"sation . . . the general sensorium is designed to receive every species of external sensation—sight, hearing, taste and smell dis- tinctly. It is the cortical substance collectively that constitutes the internal organism, corresponding to the external organism of the ªve senses . . . no individual part of the cerebrum corresponds to any sensorial organ of the body; but the cortical substance in general corresponds . . . The cortex for Swedenborg had motor as well as sensory function, or, in his typically picturesque language 37 : The cortical glandule is the last boundary where sensations termi- nate and the last prison house whence the actions break forth; for the ªbres, both sensory and motory, begin and end in these glan- dules. Remarkably, he had the idea of the somatotopic organization of motor function in the cerebral cortex. He correctly localized control of the foot in the dorsal cortex (he called it the “highest lobe”), the trunk in an intermediate site, and the face and head in the ventral cortex (his third lobe): . . . the muscle and actions which are in the ultimates of the body or in the soles of the feet depend more immediately upon the highest parts; upon the middle lobe the muscles which belong to the abdomen and thorax, and upon the third lobe those which belong to the face and head; for they seem to correspond to one another in an inverse ratio. No other suggestion of the somatotopic organization of motor cortex appears until the experiments of Fritsch and Hitzig in 1870. 127 Emanuel Swedenborg"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Further Insights into the Nervous System Swedenborg localized functions in addition to sensation and movement in the cortex. For example, he claimed that the anterior cortex is more important for higher functions than the posterior 38 : If this [anterior] portion of the cerebrum . . . is wounded then the internal senses—imagination, memory, thought—suffer; the very will is blunted. . . . This is not the case if the injury is in the back part of the cerebrum. Frontal lesions are still considered to “blunt the will.” Beyond the cortex, there are a number of other unusual insights about nervous function in Swedenborg’s writing. He called the pituitary the “arch gland . . . which receives the whole spirit of the brain and communicates it to the blood.” It was the “complement and crown of the whole chymical labo- ratory of the brain”; and the brain “stimulates the pituitary gland to pour out new life into the blood.” 39 Similar views of the pituitary do not appear until the twentieth century. Swedenborg’s view of the circulation of the cerebrospinal ºuid was not surpassed until the work of Magendie a 100 years later. 40 He was the ªrst to implicate the colliculi in vision, 41 and in fact the only one until Flourens in the nineteenth century. He suggested that a function of the corpus callosum was for “the hemispheres to intercommunicate with each other.” 42 He proposed that a function of the corpus striatum was to take over motor control from the cortex when a movement became a familiar habit or “second Nature.” 43 Sources of Swedenborg’s Ideas on the Brain Where did Swedenborg’s amazingly prescient views come from? Because of his detailed knowledge of contemporary brain anatomy and physiology, some historians thought that he must have visited brain research laboratories and there 128 Chapter 3"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"carried out dissections or participated in experiments. 44–46 For example, he was in Paris when Pourfour du Petit was conducting experiments on the effects of lesions of the cortex on movement in dogs. Thus, it was proposed that he participated in du Petit’s experiments and might have observed the somatotopic organization of motor cortex. Du Petit did realize that the cortex had motor functions, although his claims to this effect were ignored. 47 However, there is no sign that du Petit himself had any notion of the topographic arrangement of motor cortex. Furthermore, Swedenborg’s detailed travel diaries provide no evidence that he visited du Petit’s or any other laboratory studying the brain during his travels abroad. 48 Visiting churches was more his wont. The available evidence indicates that Swedenborg’s ideas came primarily, if not entirely, from a careful reading and integration of the anatomical, physiological, and clinicopathological literature that was available and that he so copiously quoted. 49, 50 He paid particularly close attention to detailed de- scriptions and observations rather than simply to the authors’ own interpreta- tions and conclusions. Furthermore, he was unusual in attempting to integrate observations of the effects of human brain injury with the details of comparative neuroanatomy. Influence and Lack Thereof Swedenborg’s writings on religion and spiritualism had an enormous impact on European and American writers and artists. Blake, Yeats, Balzac, the Brownings, Beaudelaire, and Strindberg, for example, all claimed to be particularly inºuenced by him. 51, 52 In nineteenth-century America his inºuence was strong among those interested in spiritualism and in transcendentalism. 53 Ralph Waldo Emerson, who was involved in both, declared in 1854, “This age is Sweden- borg’s.” In spite of his fame in literary, artistic, and religious circles, or perhaps partly because of it, Swedenborg’s ideas on the brain remained largely unknown until the twentieth century. The Latin originals of the Animal Economy books of the 1740s were not even mentioned in the major physiology textbooks of 129 Emanuel Swedenborg"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"the following decades, such as those by Haller (1754), Unzer (1771), Prochaska (1784), Blumenbach (1815), Magendie (1826), Bell (1829), or Müller (1840) English translations of Swedenborg that appeared in the 1840s do not seem to have fared any better. They were ignored in the standard physiology textbooks of the day such as Carpenter’s (1845) and Todd’s (1845), and in Ferrier’s (1876) monograph on the brain. Even one of the translators of The Animal Kingdom, J. J. G. Wilkinson, a London surgeon, hardly mentioned the brain in either his biography of Swedenborg or his commentary on The Animal Kingdom. 54 Early nineteenth-century reviews of Swedenborg’s biological works were few and puzzled. An Athenaeum reviewer in 1844 noted that The Animal Kingdom “will startle the physiologist and [contains] many assumptions he will be far from conceding.” 55 The most positive responses seem to have come from books on phrenology 56 or mesmerism. 57 However, by the time the ªrst volume of The Brain was published in 1882, the Zeitgeist had radically changed. Fritsch and Hitzig (1870) had dis- covered motor cortex, and the race to establish the location of the visual and other sensory cortices was well under way. Now Swedenborg’s ideas on the brain made sense, and both volumes received long rave reviews in Brain, 58 where the reviewer called it “one of the most remarkable books we have seen” and noted that: . . . it appears to have anticipated some of the most modern discoveries [on the brain] but that because of its metaphysical, ontological, theological phraseology . . . if it had not been that attention was arrested and enchanted by ªnding so many anticipa- tions of scientiªc discoveries by as much as 120 or 130 years, we should have been tempted to throw aside the book as beyond our province, if not hopelessly unintelligible.

Several examples of biologists were so ahead of their time that their writings were read but not understood by their contemporaries. Appreciation of their ideas had to wait until further advances closed the gap between them and lesser mortals. Arguably, the most famous example was Gregor Mendel. 68 Sometimes it is an otherwise well-known and successful scientist who has certain ideas that are only grasped in later generations. Outstanding examples of this are Darwin’s concept of the irregularly branching and nonhierarchical process of natural selection 69 and Claude Bernard’s maxim on the necessity of a constant internal milieu for the development of a complex nervous system. 70 Swedenborg’s case is more extreme. There is little evidence that con- temporary physiologists and anatomists even read his writings on the brain. He never held an academic post or had students, colleagues, or scientiªc corre- spondents. He never carried out any systematic empirical work on the brain, and his speculations were in the form of baroque and grandiose pronounce- ments embedded in lengthy books on the human soul by one whose fame was soon to be that of a mystic or madman. Even he seems to have lost interest in his ideas on the brain, as he never ªnished or published many of his manuscripts on the subject. Furthermore, some of his more advanced theories, such as on 131 Emanuel Swedenborg"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"the organization of motor cortex or the functions of the pituitary gland, did not appear in print until after they were no longer new.

Among the leading antievolutionists was the celebrated anatomist and paleontologist Rich- ard Owen, and among the leading defenders of evolution was T. H. Huxley (ªgure 4.1). The central dispute between them on human evolution was whether or not man’s brain was fundamentally unique.

Evolution and Victorian Politics For several decades before the publication of the Origin of Species in 1859, debate raged in Britain over the possibility of the transmutation of species and, especially, of an ape origin for humans. At the beginning of the century J.B. Lamarck elaborated the ªrst coherent theory of evolution and unambiguously"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"included humans. He thought that evolution involved continuous upward progress, an inevitable transformation of lower into upper forms of life. His “progressivism,” as well as his materialism and his belief in the inheritance of acquired characteristics, made Lamarck very appealing to the London and Edinburgh radicals of the day. They took his idea that biological evolution implies progress and improvement and applied it to society to demand social evolution and social progress. Some of the transformations they advocated were the end of aristocratic and established church privilege, introduction of universal suffrage, reform of medical care and medical education (many were physicians), education for women, and similar radical reformist notions. Correspondingly, the conservative Oxbridge scientist-clergymen who dominated early Victorian science saw Lamarck as a direct threat to the established order of Church and State. 1 Evolutionary ideas and their radical political and theological implications became more widespread with the publication in 1844 of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation by Robert Chambers, a scientiªc amateur who published anonymously because of the very real threats of blasphemy laws and economic and political persecution. 2 Vestiges argued for both cosmic and biological evo- lution, and adopted Lamarck’s idea that evolution implied improvement. Chambers’s arguments for biological evolution included the location of simpler fossils in older strata, the fundamentally similar anatomical organization of all groups of animals, and tendencies of embryos to go through stages similar to their putative ancestors. The book was a sensational best-seller, with some 24,000 copies sold in the next ten years compared with 9,500 for Darwin’s Origin over a similar period. That Chambers was a successful publisher, expert in marketing popular science, undoubtedly helped. 3 The scientiªc establishment reacted rather violently to Vestiges. Adam Sedgwick, professor of geology at Cambridge, president of the Geological Society, and a future president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, wrote a 500-page plus review of this “beastly book” to place “an iron heel upon the head of the ªlthy abortion and put an end to its crawlings” in which he made clear that the problem was not merely scientiªc: 138 Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The world cannot bear to be turned upside down . . .

The Rev.

T. H. Huxley, later to be the great battler for evolution, was almost as brutal, his review using such terms as “foolish fantasies,” “pretentious nonsense,” and “work of ªction.” 5 Despite the establishment attacks on it, Vestiges was a popular success, so much so that Disraeli parodied its fashion in middle-class salons in his 1847 novel Tancred. 6 Chambers gave ammunition to the radicals and socialists, who used the book’s ideas of biological progress to demand social progress. 7 Cham- bers certainly made many factual errors and uncritical speculations, yet, as Mayr wrote, “it was he who saw the forest where all the great British scientists of his period (except Darwin) only saw the trees.” Chambers’s book helped make both the scientiªc and lay world ready for the far more coherent and compelling arguments in the Origin, a debt that Darwin later acknowledged. Furthermore, 139 The Hippocampus Minor and Man’s Place in Nature"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"it inºuenced A.R. Wallace, codiscoverer of natural selection. It may also have had a signiªcant effect on Darwin himself, as Darwin’s son Francis later reported that his father’s copy was well read and annotated. 8 Lamarck’s and Chambers’s explicit and graphic descriptions of the trans- formation of ape into human piqued popular interest in the apes and monkeys Victorian imperialism was now bringing to Britain in increasing numbers. Chimpanzees were dressed in human clothes at the London Zoo, and anthro- pomorphic prints of them implied the proximity that these authors made explicit. 9 This “beastialization” of man implicitly supported the idea of evolu- tion, which in turn implied materialism and social transformation, thereby threatening the established church and state. The leading ªgure to combat this threat was Professor (later Sir) Richard Owen, and he was superbly placed to do so. Owen Separates Man from the Apes Owen had been elected to the Royal Society by the age of thirty, was Hunterian Professor at the Royal College of Surgeons, and became superin- tendent of the Natural History Department of the British Museum, which gave him a monopoly on dissecting animals that died in the London Zoo. He was easily England’s leading paleontologist and anatomist, the “British Cuvier.” He also became socially well connected; he received a London residence from the queen, dined with Prince Albert and the Prince of Wales, and lectured to the Royal Children on zoology. Nor was his political conservatism only theoretical: when the Chartists (advocating universal male suffrage, equal electoral districts, the end of property qualiªcations for members of parliament, and similar reforms) were thought to threaten London with their militant marches and violent demonstrations, he joined the militia of urban gentry to defend, quite literally, the status quo. 10 In the years before the publication of the Origin, Owen wrote a series of papers comparing the muscles and bones of apes with those of humans. He stressed the differences between them and used these differences to argue for 140 Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"their independent origin and the impossibility of the transmutation of one into the other. One major line of argument was that the anatomical details of the leg and foot of the orang-utan were quite incompatible with the animal standing erect and walking like a human. Lamarck’s simple-minded notion of an ape climbing down from a tree and becoming a man was clearly wrong. Another theme concerned the similarities of the heads and faces of humans and chimpanzees. Prior to Owen’s work, infant but not mature chimpanzees had been described; infant chimps have faces and heads very similar to those of human children (a phenomenon now known as neoteny), making a close relationship plausible. Owen obtained the skull of a mature chimp and, describ- ing its bony ridges for holding strong jaw muscles, its protruding jaws, and its threatening canines, contended that it was far more bestial than a baby chimp’s and too much so to be a close relative of man. 11 Then, at the peak of his career, he wrote a paper that within a few years was repudiated by the scientiªc community and ridiculed in the popular press, and ªxed him in the history books for an egregious triplet of errors rather than for his over 600 scientiªc papers, many of which had made signiªcant contri- butions. The paper, “On the Characters, Principles of Division and Primary Groups of the Class Mammalia,” was read at a meeting of the Linnean Society and again as the Rede lecture at Cambridge University, on the occasion of Owen receiving the ªrst honorary degree ever given by that university. 12 The startling part of this paper was a new classiªcation of mammals that stressed the gap between human and ape. Its timing was probably spurred by Owen’s realization that Darwin was about to publish his book on transmutation. In the eighteenth century, Linnaeus had put men, apes, monkeys, and lemurs (and bats) into a single order, Primates, and this grouping, minus bats, had been accepted by most zoologists. Owen now rejected this dominant tradition and placed humans apart from all other primates and indeed from all other mammals in a separate subclass, the Archencephala (“ruling brain”). He did so on three anatomical criteria, all of them concerning the brain. Presum- ably, he chose brain structures because of the human’s mental uniqueness and superiority. Furthermore, to strengthen his theory of the lack of continuity 141 The Hippocampus Minor and Man’s Place in Nature"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"between man and animals, he maintained that these three structures were actually found exclusively in humans, rather than merely being larger or different than in animals. He sought a truly qualitative difference between man and beast and he wanted it based on anatomical science. The ªrst fundamental difference he claimed was that only in the human does the “posterior lobe” (i.e., the posterior of the cerebrum) extend beyond the cerebellum. He supported this with illustrations contrasting the brain of a chimpanzee with that of a Negro. The comparison of a Negro brain with an ape brain was common in the nineteenth and extended well into the twentieth century. The rationale was that as the “lowest” race with “therefore” the least developed brains, blacks were the most appropriate comparison with animals. This view was nearly universal among nineteenth-century scientists, even those such as Darwin who were ardent abolitionists. 13 The most often illustrated nonwhite brain was that of the famous “Hottentot Venus” (Saartjie Baartman), who was exhibited in London and Paris and described in detail by many of the leading anatomists of the day, including Paul Broca and Georges Cuvier, both when she was alive and after her death and dissection. 14 The second difference proposed by Owen was that only humans have a posterior horn or cornu in their lateral ventricles. The third and most important difference was that only humans have a hippocampus minor. These extraordi- nary claims were supported by no citations to the literature, no brain sections, and no illustrations other than those just mentioned. Near the end of the paper, just in case the reader overlooked the importance of the missing hippocampus minor and the other supposed deprivations of the animal brain, Owen wrote: “Thus, [man] fulªlls his destiny as the supreme master of this earth and of the lower creation.” When Darwin read Owen’s paper he commented, “I cannot swallow Man . . . [so] . . . distinct from a Chimpanzee . . . I wonder what a Chimpanzee wd say to this?” 15 In the following section I describe what the hippocampus minor actually is, since the term has disappeared from contemporary neuroanatomy. Next I discuss Huxley’s challenge to Owen’s new classiªcation of man and how he used the hippocampus minor to repudiate Owen and irreparably damage 142 Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"his scientiªc credibility, thereby facilitating the acceptance of Darwin’s ideas. After I consider the origins of Owen’s criteria for humanness, I address some consequences and implications of the debate. The Hippocampus Minor The hippocampus minor is a ridge in the ºoor of the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle caused by the deep inward penetration of the calcarine ªssure. The original term for the hippocampus minor was calcar avis, and this is the one that is used today. It is not easily visible in coronal, sagittal, or horizontal sections but is clearly discernable on blunt dissection, exposing the posterior horn from above (ªgure 4.2). Where did this physically unimpressive and, to the contemporary neuroscientist, unimportant, structure get its names? In a top-down dissection through the human brain, the hippocampus is a particularly prominent feature on the ºoor of the lateral ventricle. It received its modern name from Aranzi (Arantius), a student of Vesalius in 1564, because its features reminded him of the sea horse, or hippocampus. Another somewhat less prominent structure, also visible in this approach, is a ridge on the ºoor of the posterior horn of the ventricle. As it resembles the spur on a bird’s leg, this ridge was named calcar avis, from the Latin for cock’s spur. In systemizing brain nomenclature in 1786, Vicq d’Azyr renamed these two ventricular structures. The calcar avis was named the hippocampus minor, and the hippocampus became the hippocampus major. Things got a bit bizarre for a while when Meyer in 1779 erroneously used the word hippopotamus instead of hippocam- pus, which was maintained by several authors until Burdach straightened things out in 1829. 16 The terms calcar avis and hippocampus minor continued to be used interchangeably until the later part of the nineteenth century, when the latter term disappeared, having been ofªcially expunged in the 1895 edition of Nomina Anatomica. This disappearance may have been related to the ridicule and controversy that swirled around the term in the debates we are about to relate. At this time hippopotamus again was substituted for hippocampus, but 143 The Hippocampus Minor and Man’s Place in Nature"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"in jest, as in Charles Kingsley’s Water Babies, 17 as we will see. The contrasting designation hippocampus major for what is now called the hippocampus lin- gered for a few more years, and then also fell out of use. Whereas the hippocampus minor was virtually absent from anatomy textbooks by the turn of the century, it survived in those more conservative sources, dictionaries (e.g., Webster’s New International Dictionary, 2nd ed., 1957), and encyclopedias (e.g., Encyclopedia Britannica, 13th ed., 1926). Before returning to the fate of Owen’s proposals for the hippocampus minor it may be helpful to summarize the state of contemporary knowledge of brain function. The year 1858 can be viewed as a time after the fertilization but before the birth of modern neuroscience. The phrenological movement Figure 4.2 Modern drawing of a human brain dissection showing the hippocampal formation and the calcar avis in the ºoor of the lateral ventricle (from Carpenter and Sutin, 1983, with permission). 144 Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"initiated by Gall and Spurzheim at the turn of the nineteenth century had popularized the idea of the cerebrum as a collection of organs with different psychological functions, and focused attention on the functions of the cerebral cortex. Gall’s errors of equating skull features with brain morphology had been realized in the scientiªc community, and the search for correlations between the site of cerebral damage and symptom had begun in humans and animals. Flourens’s experimental work on pigeons and other animals in the 1820s had simultaneously demolished the extreme localization of phrenology and made the idea of more limited localization of function readily acceptable. 18 However, at the time of Owen’s paper, no convincing evidence existed for the speciªc functions of any portion of the mammalian cerebrum; the hippocampus minor was no more a terra incognita than any other area. In the years immediately after Owen’s paper, three crucial events oc- curred in the understanding of brain function. The ªrst was Broca’s demon- stration in 1861 of an area critical for speech in the left frontal lobe. It was the ªrst generally accepted localization of psychological function in the human brain and it was viewed at the time as a vindication of Gall. The second was Fritsch and Hitzig’s production of speciªc movements by electrical stimulation of discrete motor centers of the cortex in 1870. The third was the discovery of the sensory areas of the cortex, which followed soon thereafter. 19 T. H. Huxley as Young Bulldog Thomas Henry Huxley was twenty-one years Owen’s junior and was hostile to the older scientist almost from the beginning of his scientiªc career. In 1850 Huxley had just returned from a four-year voyage aboard the H.M.S. Rattle- snake. Unlike Darwin’s status on the Beagle as gentleman naturalist, Huxley had been a lowly assistant surgeon, and what research he did was on his own time. It was good enough, particularly that on coelenterates, that he was elected to the Royal Society in 1851. Yet, for several years after returning, he was without a job or research funds (but with a ªanceé waiting in Australia). 20 In this period, Owen supported Huxley’s candidacy for the Royal Society and wrote several letters of recommendation for him for various teaching or 145 The Hippocampus Minor and Man’s Place in Nature"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"research posts. At the end of 1852, Huxley wrote Owen for yet another letter of recommendation, this time to the Navy. When Owen failed to answer in the next ten days, Huxley wrote again, and still did not receive an answer. Four days later the men happened to meet and Huxley described the confrontation in a letter in a way that nicely epitomizes the personalities of the junior and senior scientists 21 : Of course I was in a considerable rage. . . . I was going to walk past, but he stopped me, and in the blandest and most gracious manner said, “I have received your note. I shall grant it.” The phrase and the implied condescension were quite “touching,” so much that if I stopped for a moment longer I must knock him into the gutter. I therefore bowed and walked off. Owen sent the recommendation a few days later and the Navy gave Huxley funds to complete publication of his research from the voyage. Yet during this time Huxley repeatedly attacked Owen, but only privately, writing, for example, that “Owen is both feared and hated” and that “he [Huxley] felt it necessary always to be on guard against him [Owen].” He even thought that Owen was blocking publication of his papers and taking his grant money, both charges apparently without justiªcation. He wrote to his sister in 1852 22 : Let him [Owen] beware. . . . On my subjects I am his master and am quite ready to ªght. . . . And although he has a bitter pen . . . I can match him . . . Finally, in 1854 Huxley secured a position teaching natural history at the Government School of Mines. He kept it for another thirty years, eventually turning down chairs at Oxford and Harvard, among other places. By this time the school had become the Royal School of Science and would eventually become Imperial College. No longer needing job references from Owen, Huxley’s attacks on his senior became more public. Huxley’s scientiªc critiques of Owen in the late 1850s included ones on the subjects of parthenogenesis, 146 Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"on the presence of an anus in a group of brachiopods, on Owen’s classiªcation of Invertebrates, and on his comparative anatomy textbook. With Owen in the chair, Huxley’s Croonian lecture to the Royal Society in 1859 was a violent critique of Owen’s theory that the skull is composed of fused vertebrae. This was part of Owen’s theory of archetypes, that there was a basic pattern to which all vertebrates conformed. This theory largely derived from the idealistic mor- phology of Naturphilosophie, whose origin was the Platonic Romanticism of Goethe and Schiller. Contemporary skull nomenclature stems from this effort of Owen. 23 The ªnal personal breach between Huxley and Owen came in 1857 when Owen gave a successful series of lectures on paleontology at the Gov- ernment School of Mines. 24 They were attended by various luminaries such as the Duke of Argyll (then Postmaster General and later president of the Royal Society), Sir Charles Lyell, and David Livingston. In this connection Owen listed himself in a medical directory as “Professor of Comparative Anatomy and Paleontology” in the School of Mines. Huxley was infuriated at this intrusion into his territory and complained to the editor of the directory: Mr. Owen holds no appointment whatever at the Govt. School of Mines, and as I am the Professor of General Natural History (which includes Comparative Anatomy and Paleontology) in that Institu- tion you will observe that the statement . . . is calculated to do me injury. To a friend, Huxley wrote 25 : I have now done with him, personally. I would as soon acknowl- edge a man who had attempted to obtain my money on false pretenses. Although scientiªc controversy tended to be much more openly nasty in Victorian England than it is today, the Owen-Huxley antagonism was extreme even by standards of the time, and it had far from peaked at the time of this 147 The Hippocampus Minor and Man’s Place in Nature"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"territorial dispute. Huxley’s youthful arrogance, hot temper, and anticlericism, and Owen’s stubbornness, superciliousness, and religiosity served to exaggerate their scientiªc differences. The fact that both came from lower middle-class backgrounds, and Owen eagerly sought and Huxley tended to resist social ascent, probably further exacerbated their differences. Of course, in a few decades the amateur naturalist-clergyman Oxbridge establishment would give way to the professional scientist establishment with the Right Honorable Huxley and his friends in the X Club at its very center. 26 By the end of the 1850s, under Darwin’s tutorial, Huxley was gradually accepting the idea of transmutation and what it implied about the origin of humankind; his prepublication reading of the Origin ªnally made him a total convert to the idea of evolution. Like most of Darwin’s contemporaries, however, he never really accepted and probably never grasped Darwin’s core contribution, the concept of natural selection operating on random variation. 27 The Oxford Meeting of the British Association, 1860 The British Association for the Advancement of Science was the largest scien- tiªc organization in Britain and its annual meetings were the most public. Its meetings were reported and commented on in the press, even in the popular dailies. The serious weeklies, particularly the Athenaeum, usually carried detailed reports of the major papers presented. In anticipation of the 1858 annual meeting in Leeds, Huxley had written “The interesting question arises, shall I have a row with the great O. there?” Two years later he got what was obviously his wish. The 1860 meeting in Oxford of this “parliament of science” was the ªrst after the publication of the Origin of Species and, as a result, interest in it was high among the lay and scientiªc public. By this time the Origin had been discussed in detail in virtually all the serious press. Reviews covered the spectrum from slashing attacks by Owen (thinly anonymously) in the Edinburgh 148 Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Review and by Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, in the Quarterly Review to the undiluted enthusiasm of T. H. Huxley in both the very respectable Times (anonymously) and the radical Westminster Review. Darwin called Owen’s as- sessments “extremely malignant,” Wilberforce’s “uncommonly clever,” and Huxley’s “brilliant.” As had become his custom for virtually all public scientiªc meetings because of his chronic illness, Darwin himself did not attend, but eagerly awaited news particularly from his closest colleagues, botanist J. D. Hooker and Huxley. 28 On Thursday, June 28, the opening day of the meeting, after a paper entitled, “On the Final Causes of the Sexuality of Plants with Particular Reference to Mr. Darwin’s Work,” the chair called on Huxley for his com- ments. According to a report in the Athenaeum, the leading contemporary intellectual weekly, Huxley declined to comment because: he felt a general audience in which sentiment would unduly inter- fere with intellect, was not the public before which such a discus- sion should be carried out. Owen then asked for the ºoor to present facts “by which the public could come to some conclusions . . . of the truth of Mr. Darwin’s theory.” He then repeated his argument that the brain of the gorilla was more different from that of man than from that of the lowest primate particularly because only man had a posterior lobe, a posterior horn, and a hippocampus minor. Hence, the descent of humans from apes, a crucial implication of Darwin’s ideas, was impossible. Then Huxley rose and “denied altogether that the difference between the brain of the gorilla and man was so great,” making a “direct and unqualiªed contradiction” of Owen. In support of his position, Huxley cited previous studies and promised to defend his arguments in detail elsewhere. 29 He did so, as we will see, repeatedly over the next three years. 149 The Hippocampus Minor and Man’s Place in Nature"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The next day Huxley was planning to leave the meeting because Bishop Wilberforce was rumored to be planning to “smash Darwin,” and Huxley was afraid that the “promised debate would be merely an appeal to prejudice in a mixed audience before which the scientiªc arguments of the Bishop’s oppo- nents would be at the utmost disadvantage.” The Bishop had a ªrst-class degree in mathematics, which supposedly made him an authority on science. Owen was staying with Wilberforce, prepping him for the debate, just as he had helped him with a very negative review of the Origin. That afternoon Huxley ran into Robert Chambers, who by now was generally believed to be the author of Vestiges, the revolutionary tract on evolution. On hearing that Huxley was planning to leave, Chambers “vehemently” urged him not to “desert them.” Huxley recalled replying, “Oh! If you are going to take it that way I’ll come.” 30 The next day the lecture room was packed, and when Dr. Draper from New York ªnished his lecture, “The Intellectual Development of Europe Considered with Reference to the Views of Mr. Darwin and Others that the Progression of Organisms Is Determined by Law,” the Bishop of Oxford rose and spoke for “full half an hour . . . ridiculing Darwin badly and Huxley savagely,” and in general repeating arguments from his review of the Origin. Then turning to Huxley, and referring to the clash two days earlier between Owen and Huxley over brain anatomy and the relatedness of man and ape, “he begged to know was it through his grandfather or his grandmother that he claimed descent from a monkey?” Huxley supposedly turned to his neighbor saying, “The Lord has delivered him into mine hands.” Huxley rose, calmly, in his memory, but “white with anger” according to others, and defended Darwin’s theory as “the best explanation of the origin of species which had yet been offered.” He concluded with the most famous repartee in the history of science, that: he was not ashamed to have a monkey for his ancestor; but he would be ashamed to be connected with a man who used great gifts to obscure the truth. Some accounts were stronger ending: 150 Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"I should feel it a shame to have sprung from one who prostituted the gifts of culture and eloquence to the service of prejudice and of falsehood. According to one report: as the point became clear there was a great burst of applause, one lady fainted and had to be carried out, I for one jumped out of my seat, no one who was present can ever forget the impression it made. Other speakers followed, including FitzRoy, now Admiral, formerly Captain of the Beagle, regretting the publication of Darwin’s book, and John Lubbock, pioneering ethologist, accepting the Darwinian hypothesis as the best available. Speaking last and at length, J. D. Hooker gave a detailed refutation of Wilber- force and defense of Darwin using his expertise as a botanist and biogeographer. Years later, particularly after accounts of these events were published by Huxley and Darwin’s sons, the exchange between Huxley and Wilberforce took on a exaggerated mythic existence as the “Great Battle in the War between Science and Religion,” the most famous nineteenth-century battle after Wa- terloo, in which Huxley committed “forensic murder” and Wilberforce “in- voluntary martyrdom.” At the time, however, each man believed himself the victor. Furthermore, Hooker thought he, rather than Huxley, had demolished Wilberforce. The audience seems to have been divided among these three views; the Athenaeum summarized it all as “uncommonly lively.” Jensen criti- cally reviewed the contemporary reports, the recollections of the participants, and the large and ever growing secondary literature on this so-called debate. 31 The “Bulldog” and “Gladiator-General for Science” Attacks 32 Huxley had been waiting and preparing for his attack on Owen at the British Association meeting for some time. As soon as he read Owen’s new classiªca- 151 The Hippocampus Minor and Man’s Place in Nature"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"tion scheme separating humans from other primates on the basis of brain structure, he began systematically to dissect monkey brains. He soon realized the magnitude of Owen’s errors and saw his opportunity to “nail . . . [Owen] . . . that menditous humbug . . . like a kite to the barn door.” He said nothing publicly until his contradiction in the opening session of the 1860 Oxford meeting. After that, as promised, he began to attack Owen’s claims in print and with a vengeance. He used his new journal, Natural History Review, as a major platform. He had just founded it as a pro-Darwin and anticlerical (“episcopo- phagous”) organ. 33 The opening of Huxley’s campaign came in 1861 in the ªrst issue. 34 There he attacked the three claims of Owen, that only man’s cerebrum covered the cerebellum (the posterior lobe), that only man had a posterior horn in his lateral ventricle, and that only man had a hippocampus minor. He did so with a barrage of citations, quotations, and personal communications from leading anatomists in Britain and abroad. Huxley was interested in doing more than proving Owen wrong. He wanted to prove him dishonest as well. Thus, he put great emphasis on quoting three particular sources that Owen must have known about, and stated that in failing to mention them he was “guilty of willful and deliberate falsehood.” The ªrst of these sources was Owen himself in a monograph that was a major factor in establishing the man’s anatomical reputation, and that antedated Vestiges and Owen’s antipathy to transmutation. In it Owen brieºy notes that the cerebral hemispheres of the baboon and chimpanzee extend beyond the cerebellum. 35 The second authority was F. Tiedemann, a distinguished German anato- mist from whose 1836 paper in the Philosophical Transactions Owen copied, without attribution, the drawing of the Negro brain in his classiªcation paper. Huxley quoted earlier papers by Tiedemann describing, in infrahuman primates, the cerebrum extending beyond the cerebellum and a posterior horn in the lateral ventricle. He was a little misleading here, since in the paper from which Owen obtained the drawing of the Negro brain, illustrations of orang-utan and chimpanzee brains actually show the cerebrum not extending beyond the cerebellum. Huxley also rather quickly passed over Tiedemann’s earlier failure 152 Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"to ªnd a hippocampus minor in any animal other than man. 36 (The point of Tiedemann’s 1836 paper, incidentally, was to argue, rather iconoclastically, for the neuroanatomical, intellectual, and moral equality of whites and blacks. To support their anatomical equality, he showed the brain of the “Hottentot Venus” and claimed, unlike several other anatomists, that it is essentially identical to the brains of Europeans. To support his claim of intellectual and moral equality, Teidemann provided a list of distinguished black clergyman, intellectuals, artists, and political leaders.) The third source Huxley used to impugn Owen’s integrity was a paper by Dutch anatomists J. L. C. Schroeder van der Kolk and W. Vrolik. 37 Again Owen must have seen this paper since that is where he obtained, again without attribution, his illustration of a chimpanzee brain showing its cerebellum un- covered by the cerebrum. In this paper the authors clearly described a posterior horn and a hippocampus minor in the chimpanzee. As to their ªgure showing the exposed cerebellum, Huxley quoted Gratiolet, the leading brain anatomist of the day, that this speciªc ªgure was greatly distorted and misleading because of the way the brain was removed from the skull. Tiedemann’s drawings of both the orang-utang and the chimpanzee showed the same distortion. 38 This must have been a common error and not quite the absurdity Huxley claimed. Animals, and certainly rare apes, were not perfused with a ªxative for anatomi- cal purposes when they were still alive, as is done today, under anesthesia, for optimal histological ªxation. Rather, when they died, usually in a zoo, their brains were removed and placed in a preservative. Under these conditions the kind of distortion that misled Owen and his sources must have been common indeed. Owen’s Linnean (1858) and Rede lectures (1859) on the classiªcation of mammals were identical except for a footnote missing from the latter. In that note Owen said he was unable to shut his eyes to the “all-pervading similitude of structure which makes the determination of the differences between” human and chimpanzee “so difªcult.” He presumably originally included this comment to stress the importance of his three new cerebral criteria for distinguishing human and ape, but then may have omitted it in the republication because he 153 The Hippocampus Minor and Man’s Place in Nature"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"realized it undercut his theory. In any case Huxley, here and many times again, reveled in quoting this footnote, which he treated as the ultimate hoisting petard. At the end of his Natural History Review paper, Huxley readily admitted several differences between the human brain and that of the higher apes, such as size, relative proportions of different parts, and the complexity and number of convolutions. These he believed were “of no very great value” because they were the same as those between the brains of the “highest” and “lowest” human races “though more in degree.” He then took exception to Tiedemann’s view that the brain of a black was no different from that of a European, since this weakened his view of the continuity between human and ape, with the “lower” races of man intermediate. In any case, he concluded, the brains of monkeys “differ far more widely from the brain of an orang than the brain of an orang differs from that of man” and therefore, Owen’s dividing the two by cerebral characters was wrong. As soon as this paper appeared Huxley sent the “Lord Bishop of Oxford” a reprint of it with a short note to “draw attention” to it as a “full justiªcation for contradicting Owen at the Oxford British Association meeting.” Wilber- force answered politely. 39 When Darwin read Huxley’s paper he congratulated him and called the paper a “complete and awful smasher . . . for Owen.” As to Owen, he called Huxley a “humbug” for omitting the footnote on the similarity of man and apes in his Rede lecture to the “orthodox Cambridge dons.” 40 The second issue of the Natural History Review contained an article on an orang-utan brain by George Rolleston, who had won the chair of anatomy at Oxford, with Huxley’s help over a candidate of Owen’s. The article placed great emphasis on showing the cerebrum covering the cerebellum, and both a posterior horn and a hippocampus minor in orang-utan and human. It was illustrated with an elegant three-dimensional engraving of a horizontal dissec- tion of the orang-utan brain showing a rather prominent hippocampus minor.

Rolleston noted that as he did not hold a materialist position, he believed the similarities of the brains of men and apes were, in any case, irrelevant to the species’ mental status. (Huxley commented in a letter to Hooker that although Rolleston “had a great deal of Oxford slough [i.e., snake skin] to shed . . . his testimony on that very background has been of especial service.” 41 ) In the third issue, John Marshall, another friend of Huxley’s, made essentially the same points about the falsity of Owen’s three distinctions, in this case for the chimpanzee and with a great ºourish of detailed measurements. Presumably to establish his credability, Marshall assures us to no “leaning toward any of the developmental hypotheses of the origin of species.” He too explains that if a brain was not properly preserved and removed from the skull it would be grossly distorted and look like the one of a chimpanzee in Owen’s paper. The article includes an actual mounted photographic print of a dissection showing the posterior horn and the hippocampus minor. A drawing based on this photograph was later published by Huxley and is shown in ªgure 4.3. 42 The last issue of the year included an article on the anatomy of primate muscles, particularly those of the orang-utan, by W. S. Church. 43 The general theme was that examination of the range of variation among humans, particu- larly in the “lower” or “wild” races, reveals a smaller gap between the myology of humans and apes than noted by others, such as Owen. The author’s dissections suggest that the chimpanzee and the gorilla “are able to point with their ªnger in the same manner as man.” Owen answered Huxley at a Royal Institution lecture reported in the Athenaeum, with a circulation of about 15,000, as compared with the Review ’s of about 1,000. Owen repeated his claim of the three structures speciªc to man, but hedged a little by saying that apes do not have a hippocampus minor “as deªned in human anatomy.” The accompanying brain illustrations were enti- tled “section of a Negro’s brain” and “section of animal’s brain.” Both were otherwise unlabeled and their details unrecognizable and inaccurate. The next week Huxley wrote in to ridicule the inaccurate and unlabeled ªgures and to 155 The Hippocampus Minor and Man’s Place in Nature"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"156 Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"excoriate the reporter for failing to mention the numerous previous scientists who reported that the three critical structures were found in animals, since: doubtless Prof. Owen, following the course which would be taken by most men of science . . . allowed full weight to the afªrmations of these eminent persons . . . and pointed out how they had been so misled as to describe . . . and ªgure . . . structures which have no existence. In the following issue Owen blamed “the Artist” for the poor ªgures, but attested to the accuracy of the account otherwise. For a more accurate ªgure he referred the reader to his original paper, that is, to the distorted ªgure lifted from Schroeder van der Kolk and Vrolik. 44 Owen’s next detailed answer came in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History (circulation about 2,000). He republished both the Dutch chimpanzee ªgure (in spite of the comments of Gratiolet, Marshall, and Huxley) and Tiedemann’s human brain ªgure that had been in his original paper, but he added drawings of the lateral ventricle in both species. The chimpanzee’s ventricle had no hippocampus minor labeled on it, and Owen failed to mention that its source indicated one existed in this species. This time he cited the sources of his ªgures and pointed out that neither the Dutch nor German workers could have been inºuenced by their views on evolution since both had published before the Origin and even before Vestiges. He ended the paper by simply restating his three original claims for a difference between the brains of humans and all other creatures. 45 Figure 4.3 “Drawings of the cerebral hemispheres of a Man and of a Chimpanzee of the same length, in order to show the relative proportions of the parts: the former taken from a specimen, which Mr. Flower, Conservator of the Museum of the Royal College of Sur- geons, was good enough to dissect for me; the latter, from the photograph in Mr. Mar- shall’s paper (Marshall, 1861) . . . a, posterior lobe; b, lateral ventricle; c, posterior cornu; x, the hippocampus minor” (Huxley, 1863). 157 The Hippocampus Minor and Man’s Place in Nature"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Later that year Huxley weighed in with his own empirical paper “On the Brain of Ateles paniscus, ” the South American spider monkey, in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society. As with the other primate anatomy papers spurred by the controversy, the emphasis was on refuting Owen’s three points, particularly on the hippocampus minor. The paper contained a set of carefully drawn human and simian coronal brain sections, as well as a horizontal dissec- tion of the lateral ventricle, all designed to show prominently the hippocampus minor. In the course of his detailed study of this structure, Huxley corrected a major error in previous descriptions of human and other primate brains and effected a lasting change in sulcal terminology. Before him, the major sulcus on the medical surface of the hemisphere was termed the hippocampal ªssure and was supposed to extend from the corpus callosum to almost the posterior pole. In the course of studying sections through the hippocampus minor, Huxley realized that this hippocampal ªssure consisted of two separate sulci, a posterior and anterior one. The indentation of the posterior one into the lateral ventricle formed the hippocampus minor, so he named it the calcarine sulcus after calcar avis. He named the anterior part the dentate sulcus, since it corresponded to the fascia dentata. “Calcarine sulcus,” of course, entered into the permanent canon, but the term hippocampal ªssure or sulcus was maintained for the anterior part (except by Huxley’s followers), perhaps because the term dentate gyrus was already widespread. 46 Huxley had only begun his campaign. In 1862 the onslaught against Owen spread to that most prestigious venue of them all, the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. There another protégé of Huxley’s, William Henry Flower, later Sir, after stating that he had no views on transmutation or the origin of man, proceeded to refute Owen’s human-ape distinctions. He provided a detailed review of the earlier literature and then carefully presented the results of his own dissections of sixteen different primate species, including the orang-utan, several species of Old and New World monkeys, and several prosimians. Flower not only found a hippocampus minor in all these primates, but went on to claim that the hippocampus minor is largest in proportion to the mass of cerebral substance in the marmoset, next in monkeys, then apes, 158 Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"and least in humans. Drawings of two of his dissections are shown in ªgure 4.4; the hippocampus minor in both, particularly the marmoset, certainly appears prominent, if not rather exaggerated. In addition to his being a close friend of Flower, Huxley’s hand in the paper is shown explicitly in two ways. First, the nomenclature that Flower used included terms just introduced by Huxley. Second, Huxley was one of the anonymous reviewers for Flower’s paper and commented in his review “this important paper should be published” (ªgure 4.5). The other reviewer was John Marshall, another member of Huxley’s anti-Owen team of neuroanatomists. 47 Figure 4.4 Horizontal views of the cerebrum of a vervet (left) and a marmoset (right). “On the right side [of the vervet] the middle and posterior cornu are completely opened, so as to exhibit the relative size and situation of the two hippocampi.

They reported at an 1862 meeting of the Dutch Royal Academy of Science that, in fact, this animal had an extensive posterior lobe covering the cerebellum as well as a posterior horn and a hippocampus minor. The attending audience, they wrote, recognized all three structures. The authors admitted the inade- quacy of their original ªgure due to the way they had removed the brain from the cranium, and they disavowed any position on transmutation, but suggested that Owen had “gotten lost” and “fell into a trap” by his desire to combat Darwin. Huxley promptly reprinted the entire article, still in French, in his Review. 49 That year and the next, the confrontations between Owen and Huxley continued in person and in print. For example, when Owen defended his position at the 1862 British Association meeting in Cambridge, his talk was reported in detail in the Medical Times and Gazette along with objections by Huxley and by his allies Rolleston and Flower, followed by Owen’s rebuttal. 50 The next two issues contained further rounds between the combatants. The Hippocampus Minor Goes Pop While Owen and Huxley were ªghting at meetings and in the scientiªc journals, the popular press was featuring and, usually, satirizing the hippocampus minor debate. One example is the anonymous poem from Punch shown in ªgure 4.6. It was written by Sir Philip Egerton, a paleontologist and member of parliament. After accurately epitomizing Vestiges, Darwin, and some recent archeological discoveries, the author focused in on Huxley and Owen’s contest. In that year alone Punch had about a half dozen satirical pieces about the debate or its participants (ªgure 4.7). Both Owen and Huxley and the hippocampus minor were featured in Charles Kingsley’s children’s fantasy Water Babies, originally published in 1863 and still in print and a favorite in Britain (see ªgure 4.1).

In an anonymous and well-informed eight-page squib entitled “A Report of a Sad Case Recently Tried before the Lord Mayor, Owen versus Huxley . . . ” (ªgure 4.8), Owen and Huxley are dragged into court for brawling in the streets and disturbing the peace. The ªght continues in court with much shouting of “posterior cornu,” “hippocampus minor,” and so on, as Huxley: Well, as I was saying, Owen and me is in the same trade; and we both cuts up monkeys, and I ªnds something in the brains of them. Hallo! says I, here’s a hippocampus. No, there ain’t says Owen. Look here says I. I can’t see it he says and he sets to werriting and haggling about it, and goes and tells everybody, as what I ªnds ain’t there, and what he ªnds is . . . At the end of the trial, the Lord Mayor declines to punish either because “no punishment could reform offendors so incorrigible.” He does suggest to Owen that rather than being bitter at being compared with an ape he might act less like one and more like a man. He suggests to Huxley that he is less interested in the truth than in destroying his rival. Another anonymous pamphlet that year, entitled “Speech of Lord Dun- dreary . . . on the Great Hippocampus Questions,” was also by Kingsley. The authors of these parodies not only knew every detail of the controversy but the personalities of the combatants and their friends intimately. 164 Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Figure 4.7 Owen and Huxley dancing a jig before the 1865 British Asso- ciation Meeting.

I am sick of the dilettante middle classes. As early as 1860 he began to devote these lectures to evolution and particularly to the evolution of man, a topic that Darwin avoided in public for another twenty years. On March 22, 1861, he wrote to his wife, “My working men stick by me wonderfully, the house being fuller than ever last night.

It thus lays the basis for Darwin and Ro- manes’s ºorid anthropomorphizing in defense of psychological continuity be- tween humans and animals. When this tendency to attribute high mental functions to animals was reduced by C. Lloyd Morgan’s law of parsimony, Occam’s razor for students of animal behavior, this continuity argument became the basis of modern behavioristic psychology. 53 The second part, “On the Relations of Man to the Lower Animals,” is the heart of the book. It begins with arguments from embryology and cell theory for the fundamental unity of all animals, including, of course, humans. Then the bones, skull, and teeth of humans and apes are discussed, with the conclusion that “the lower Apes and the Gorilla . . . differ more than the Gorilla and the Man.” Next, and it almost seems like the raison d’etre for the whole book, we come to an account of the fundamental similarity of the brain of apes and humans, particularly the possession by both of a posterior lobe, a posterior horn, and a hippocampus minor. The account is a twelve-page, step-by-step argument, but perhaps it had to be since the audience addressed had never heard of a brain ventricle, let alone the hippocampus minor. At the end of the chapter, Huxley points out that the close similarity of human and ape that he has just demonstrated proves the validity of Linnaeus’s original Primate order, and ends by stating, in a rather offhand manner, that Darwin’s theory provides an explanation of the origin of man from ape. Interposed between the second and third parts are six pages of ªne print providing, “a succinct History of the Controversy respecting the Cerebral Structure of Man and the Apes,” that is, how Owen “suppressed” and denied the truth about the hippocampus minor, posterior horn, and posterior lobe, and how this was now a matter of “personal veracity.” The ªnal portion of Man’s Place, “On Some Fossil Remains of Man,” deals with the evidence for a fossil link between ape and human, which Huxley admitted was very meager indeed. At the time, judging by a sample of the reviews, Huxley’s book was regarded chieºy as a polemic against Owen, favorably by Huxley’s partisans who were in the majority by now, and unfavorably by Owen’s allies. Darwin, natural selection, and even evolution, as distinct from the human’s systematic 168 Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"status, are not major issues in these reviews and indeed they are not major concerns in the book. Probably the most inºuential evaluation was that of Sir Charles Lyell, Britain’s leading geologist and one of its most eminent scientists. Through nine editions his Principles of Geology rejected the idea of evolution. Now in Antiquity of Man he evenhandedly discussed the pros and cons of Darwin’s theory, disappointing Darwin, but actually moving a very long way closer to him. He also reviewed the hippocampus minor debate in detail. Lyell came down totally and unambiguously on Huxley’s side, which must have effectively ended the discussion in the scientiªc community. 54 Owen, no surprise, attempted to refute Lyell and continued to defend his classiªcation scheme against its critics. He even found a new support for the importance of the hippocampus minor: that it was absent, or virtually so, in an “idiot.” 55 Owen’s ªnal statements on the controversy are in On the Anatomy of Vertebrates. There his brain ªgures are accurate, and in a long footnote he ªnally admits, citing himself as well as the earlier literature, that in apes “all the homologous parts of the human cerebral organ exist.” However, this admission, he believes, does not invalidate or even threaten his classiªcation of man in a separate subclass because the critical structures, the posterior lobe, the posterior horn, and the hippocampus minor, exist in apes only “. . . under modiªed form and low grades of development.” As to Huxley and his neuroanatomical allies, their attacks on his classiªcatory scheme were “puerile,” “ridiculous,” and “disgraceful.” 56 Owen’s original aim was to deªne the uniqueness of humankind, to ªnd an objective way of differentiating humans from animals that was (a) qualitative and not merely quantitative, (b) solidly grounded in anatomical science rather than theology or speculation, and (c) based on the brain, the origin of the most striking differences between humans and animals. His downfall was not this goal but his hubris in stubbornly defending his errors in trying to reach it. The tragedy was classic: Owen fell from the pinnacle of British science to be remembered, when at all, for his obstinate errors in this debate, rather than for his real contributions. 169 The Hippocampus Minor and Man’s Place in Nature"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"The Sources of Owen’s Three Criteria Where did Owen get his three benchmarks whose repudiation by Huxley destroyed his credibility as a critic of Darwin and evolution? One source for his idea that the posterior extent of the cerebrum in humans was a powerful indicator of their elevated taxonomic status was probably a ªgure in Fletcher’s Rudiments of Physiology. This ªgure shows a series of dorsal views of the brain, drawn to the same size, starting with cuttleªsh [sic], then eel, turtle, bird, marmot, and “up” through otter, to orang-utan, to the human. 57 A line is drawn at the posterior border of the cerebrum (or its supposed homolog) to show that moving “upward” in the animal scale the cerebrum moves posteriorly until, in the human, it covers the rest of the brain, the cerebellum being the last structure to disappear from view. Fletcher’s idea of these systematic changes correlating with increasing complexity was used by Chambers as a major argument for evolution in Vestiges and therefore must have been well known to Owen, at least through this source (Owen had originally been quite sympathetic to Vestiges 58 ). As mentioned previously, this idea that the cerebellum was exposed even in the highest nonhuman primates was supported by published drawings of “distorted” ape brains. 59 Owen’s choice of structures in the lateral ventricles for his other two ways of distinguishing humans and animals appears to be a persistence of the importance Galen gave the ventricles centuries earlier. The ventricles played a central role in his physiological system, a set of theoretical views that dominated Western medicine for over 1,400 years and was inºuential into the nineteenth century. Galen thought the ventricles were the primary site of production of psychic pneuma, which he believed was a critical mediator of cerebral function and the medium of transmission in sensory and motor nerves. The early church fathers, particularly Nemesius, Bishop of Emesia (fourth century), radically altered Galen’s conceptions of the structure and function of the ventricles, transforming the ventricles into three more “perfect” spheres. Galen had local- ized sensory and motor functions in the solid portions of the cerebrum, the former anteriorly and the latter posteriorly. The church fathers, however, were 170 Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"looking for a less mundane site for the interaction of the body and soul and chose for this purpose the “empty” spaces in the brain that Galen described, the ventricles. They then took the Aristotelian faculties of the mind, sensation, cognition, and memory, and located them in the anterior, middle, and posterior ventricles, respectively (see ªgure 1.7). Drawings of this ventricular localization of mental function hardly changed for over a thousand years except for the expressions on the faces. When systematic brain dissection began again in the Renaissance the brains were usually dissected from the top down, often in situ. The ventricles were carefully depicted and labeled because of their importance in Galenic theory. The most famous of these early horizontal dissections was that of Vesalius in his revolutionary work, On the Fabric of the Human Body, published in 1543 (see ªgure 1.10). Horizontal views in which the ventricular features are prominent continued to be a common way of depicting the internal structure of the human brain into the nineteenth century (see ªgure 1.15). Thus, ventricular structures were carefully depicted and named, whereas the cortex was often drawn in a schematic fashion, since, until Gall and phrenology, it was usually thought to be unimportant. The theoretical importance of the ventricles persisted presumably because no better theory of brain function emerged, and better theories, not better facts, are required to overturn a theory. Given this tradition it is not all that surprising that Owen, looking for important and “higher” parts of the human brain, looked into the ventricles. See chapter 1 for further discussion of ventricular theory. Man’s Place in Nature in History A second edition of Huxley’s Man’s Place in Nature was published in 1896. A number of things had changed since the ªrst edition. The general idea of evolution, including that of humans, was now accepted by most of the scientiªc community. Darwin’s The Descent of Man had been published offering detailed mechanisms for the evolution of the human body, mind, and morals. It con- tained an appendix by Huxley on the similarities and differences between 171 The Hippocampus Minor and Man’s Place in Nature"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"human and ape brains. The hippocampus minor is mentioned only in passing, but never Owen. Sir Richard had died in 1892 and in the ultimate conªrmation of the saying, “history is written by the victors,” his grandson asked Huxley for an account of Owen’s “Position in the History of Anatomical Science” to include in the book he was writing on the life of Owen. 60 Huxley gave him sixty pages that did not refer to any of their bitter disputes and were full of phrases such as “unabated industry,” “wide knowledge,” “great service,” “splendid record,” and “sagacious interpretations.” By this time Huxley was the Right Honorable (a privy counselor) and had been president of the Royal, Ethnological, Geological, and Palaeontographical Societies, the British Associa- tion, and the National Association of Science Teachers, as well as university president and dean. More generally, the social and political scene had changed. The Reform Act of 1867 giving the urban working class the vote eliminated the threat of revolution, or perhaps the decline of this threat made the Act possible, and the end of religious tests had opened the doors of Oxford and Cambridge to dissenters and Jews as students and faculty. Both developments tended to reduce the political charge of evolutionary ideas. The dominance of the Oxbridge clergyman-naturalist had given way to that of the professional scientist of which Huxley was the archetype. As much as personality clashes or scientiªc differ- ences, the conºict between Owen and Huxley represented this transfer of power. Although they came from similar middle-class, nonuniversity back- grounds, Owen early attached himself to the medical, religious, and political establishment. In contrast, Huxley fought to professionalize science and free it from the dominance of clergy and gentry, although he carefully kept his distance from the political radicals of the time. 61 In defeating Owen and his backers, Huxley and his friends had become the Establishment, and in doing so, the hippocampus minor was Huxley’s most successful weapon. The new edition of Man’s Place reºected changes in the status of evolu- tionary theory and of Huxley himself. The title had become more assertive, dropping “Evidence as to” and becoming simply Man’s Place in Nature. The 172 Chapter 4"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"section “Succinct History” of Owen’s supposed perªdy was eliminated entirely and Owen hardly mentioned at all. Today this book is usually viewed as a triumph of evolutionary thought rather than an attack on Owen or a defense of Linnaeus, and its relevance to the hippocampus minor has been totally lost. Huxley is admired for charging in where Darwin feared to tread for another eight years. Homer Smith, physiologist and historian of science, called it “the ªrst . . . [and still] . . . deªnitive statement of the naturalistic interpretation [of man] . . . ,” Sir Arthur Keith, pioneering anthropologist, claimed it “laid the basis for a true science of anthropology” and “can only be compared to Harvey’s Movement of the Heart and Blood. ” Ashley Montagu, in an introduction to a paperback edition, called it a “great classic of science” and “among the most inspiring.” 62 The Place of the Hippocampus Minor in Man’s Search for Meaning Richard Owen identiªed the hippocampus minor and its associated structures as the touchstone of humanness. Other choices for this function from brain anatomy have included the size of the frontal lobes, brain laterality, and the position of the lunate sulcus. Perhaps the earliest was that of Herophilus, the Alexandrian anatomist in the second century BCE who attributed man’s greater intelligence to his more complex cerebellum, or so Galen, in ridiculing this view, tells us. 63 Thomas Huxley chose language in Man’s Place as the criterion of human- ity, and some of its contemporary reviewers pointed out that in doing so he was playing the same game he attacked when Owen played it. 64 Human language continues to be a popular candidate for a hippocampus minor, al- though whether the uniqueness of language lies in its unbounded vocabulary, inªnite set of sentences of arbitrary size and complexity, ability to code distant time and place, self-reference, or ability to lie is unclear. For his ordering of organisms, Linnaeus preferred sexual characteristics, at least for plants, and when he could get them, for animals (e.g., mammae). 173 The Hippocampus Minor and Man’s Place in Nature"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Perhaps inspired by him, variety of coital positions, desire for privacy during intercourse, and orgasm in females have all been offered as distinguishing features of Homo sapiens (and counterindicated), as has the ratio of the size of the erect penis and of the female breasts to body weight. 65 DNA was a transient hope, but the difference between human and chimpanzee (about 1.6%) is rather anxiety provoking. One basic human characteristic does seem to be the need to establish differences between ourselves and our closest relatives; for that purpose, the hippocampus minor may be as good a criterion as any other. 66 Notes 1.

An interesting exception was Wallace (1891), who stated in Natural Selection that the “brain of the lowest savage . . . is little inferior to that of the highest types of man”; and in My Life, (1905), “The more I see of uncivilized people, the better I think of human nature and the essential differences between civilized and savage men seem to disappear.” Wallace’s tolerant and relatively nonracist attitude may have been the result of having lived among Paciªc Islanders for eight years and traveled under their care on long voyages over the open seas. In contrast, Darwin and Huxley made their observations about the primitive minds of the lower races largely from the decks of H.M.S. Beagle and H.M.S. Rattlesnake. Wallace’s views of the full development of the brain and in some cases the moral sense among “savages” led him to reject totally natural selection as a basis for humans’ intellectual and moral development (Wallace, 1891). He appealed to “some higher intelli- gence” as an alternative. The fact that such religious mysticism was now out of fashion, plus his involvement in various spiritualist activities such as table rapping, obscured Wallace’s observations and insights of how cultural evolution was replacing biological evolution in the development of human civilization (Eiseley, 1961). Otherwise, perhaps a “social Wallacism” might have developed. 14. Gould, 1981; Tiedemann, 1836; Topinard, 1878.

How do we recognize ºowers and faces and all the other inªnitely varied inhabitants of our visual world? How do we know where objects around us are located even when our eyes, head, and bodies and the objects themselves are moving? At midtwentieth century, the answer to these questions seemed clear: striate cortex (area 17), and only striate cortex, was responsible for the visual perception of form, color, movement, and space—for our consciousness of the visual world. As Karl Lashley, professor of neuropsychology at Harvard and the leading physiological psychologist of the day, put it, “ . . . visual habits are dependent upon the striate cortex and upon no other part of the cerebral cortex.” 1 The leading textbook concurred 2 : Figure 5.1 Lateral and ventral views of a macaque monkey brain illustrating some of the known subdivisions of visual cortex.

Whenever the question has been tested in animals the story has been the same. As recently as 1975, Krieg’s monumental treatise on primate brain anatomy asserted that “image formation and recognition is all in area 17 and is entirely intrinsic . . . the connections of area 17 are minimal.” 3 Today, we know that an area much larger than striate cortex is involved in visual function. Speciªcally, the boundaries of the cortical region involved in visual function have ºowed forward out of the occipital lobe, deep into the temporal, parietal, and even frontal lobes; visual cortex consists of more than two dozen discrete visual areas making up more than half the primate cerebral cortex (ªgure 5.1). In this chapter I ªrst consider the discovery of the visual areas adjacent to striate cortex in the occipital lobe and then the discovery of visual cortex in the temporal and parietal lobes. Our survey ends in 1982 with the introduction of the idea of two cortical streams of visual processing. Sensory Centers in the Cerebral Cortex The modern study of the cerebral cortex began in the latter half of the nineteenth century, a period Hans-Lukas Teuber called the heroic age of neuropsychology. 4 The tasks faced were Herculean, the principal players with their bushy beards and ªerce countenances were larger than life, and the virulence of their clashes went well beyond the usual academic disputes. A central question in this period was the localization of discrete sensory centers in the cerebral cortex. The idea that the cortex consisted of a set of organs with speciªc psychological functions was ªrst systematically proposed by Franz Joseph Gall in his phrenological system at the beginning of the century. 5 The possibility of the localization of psychological function was actively debated until 1861, when Paul Broca’s demonstration of a language 182 Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"center in the frontal lobe was viewed as ending the debate in Gall’s favor. 6 Further support for Gall’s general idea came from Gustav Fritsch and Edouard Hitzig’s discovery of motor cortex. 7 As described in chapter 1, a major con- troversy concerned the location of the visual center: David Ferrier placed it in the angular gyrus of the parietal lobe, whereas E. A. Schäfer and then Hermann Munk claimed it was in the occipital lobe. By the turn of the century, the visual area was ªrmly placed in occipital cortex and soon after identiªed with striate cortex. Ever since then, as recounted in the rest of this chapter, visual mechanisms have been discovered in the cerebral cortex outside of striate cortex. Visual Association Cortex In the last decades of the nineteenth century Paul Flechsig, 8 on the basis of time of myelination, divided the cerebral cortex into three regions: the primary or projection zones, the intermediate zones, and the terminal zones, the latter two together called the association cortex (see ªgure 1.24). He chose the term “association” because he believed that these regions myelinated in humans at the age when children began to associate the different senses with each other and with movement. In his scheme, only the primary areas received sensory input from below the cortex, and this input was conªned to one modality. The output of the modality-speciªc primary areas was to the intermediate zones surrounding each of the primary areas; they remained unimodal and further elaborated the sensations into perceptions, which might then be “associated” with the other sensory modalities by way of long association ªbers in the terminal zone. At this time psychology was dominated by British associationism (typiªed by John Stuart Mill and Alexander Bain), and association cortex was quickly assigned the tasks of the “association of sensations into perceptions, images, ideas and memories.” 9 The idea that sensations were fundamentally different from perceptions was much older, deriving from Aristotle, as in his dictum, “It is not the bell that enters the ear, but the energy of the sound that leaves the bell.” This difference was emphasized by David Hume in the 183 Beyond Striate Cortex"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"eighteenth century in his distinction between “impressions and ideas,” and in the twentieth century by E. B. Titchener. 10 Flechsig’s concept that each sensory receiving area had an adjacent modality-speciªc association area persisted into the early 1940s as shown in ªgure 5.2, taken from the leading physiological psychology text book of the day. At the turn of the twentieth century, inspired by these theoretical con- ceptions, the intermediate visual zone was termed “visuopsychic” to distinguish it from the primary visual or visuosensory area now identiªed with striate cortex. On “histological” grounds, J. S. Bolton and Alfred Campbell, both working in the Rainhill Asylum, Lancashire, deªned the visuopsychic area as a 1.3- to 2-cm strip surrounding the visuosensory area. As the latter put it, the visuosensory center is “a primary station . . . for the receipt of impressions derived from . . . both retinal ªelds.” In contrast, the visuopsychic center, “. . . is an area wherein visual impressions are further dealt with in the process of elaboration and intellectual interpretations . . .” 11 The arguments for the func- tions attributed to the visuopsychic area as opposed to the visuosensory one were strictly anatomical, embryological, and theoretical: Campbell was pessi- mistic about the possibility of ªnding patients with sufªciently discrete lesions to distinguish the two areas. G. Elliot Smith, professor of anatomy at the Egyptian School of Medicine in Cairo, divided the Bolton-Campbell visuopsychic area into a zone adjacent to striate cortex, which he named parastriate cortex, and an outer zone, which he named peristriate cortex. 12 These areas corresponded roughly to Brodmann’s areas 18 and 19, designated at about the same time, and to the ones von Economo (1929) named areas OB and OA in 1929. 13 The outer zone, peristriate or 19, was assumed to have more complex psychic functions than the inner zone, parastriate or 18 (ªgure 5.3). Collectively, areas 18 and 19 were often grouped as visual association cortex, which together with temporal and parietal association cortex was known as posterior association cortex. With assumption and theory continuing to outstrip evidence, psychic blindness, or, as it came to be known, visual agnosia, was believed to be caused by “loss of associations between optical sensations and what they signify,” as 184 Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"William James put it. 14 Therefore it was assumed to be due to damage to the visuopsychic areas. As additional cases of visual agnosia were reported they were usually attributed to damage to this visual association cortex, although the evidence was rarely enough to justify more than a vague posterior location of the injury, if that. Originally, it had been thought that only striate cortex was a cortical retina, that is, topographically organized with a “map” of the retina; parastriate and peristriate cortex (areas 18 and 19) were not believed to be topographically organized. Rather, they were supposed to be concerned with perceptual and association functions and not sensory function. With the rise of electrical mapping of sensory cortex, however, quite the contrary soon became clear.

As we will see later, in both the cat and the monkey, many more cortical retinas—maps of the retina—were found.

The ªrst was on temporal lobe damage. When this observation was eventually repeated and extended, it led to the discovery of the critical role of inferior temporal neurons in object recognition. The second observation was on parietal lobe damage. It led to the realization of the critical role of posterior parietal cortex in spatial vision. The ªrst observation was made by Brown and Schäfer in 1888 in an article that played a deªnitive role in establishing the visual area in the occipital lobes. 17 Brown and Schäfer opposed Ferrier’s views not only on the location of the visual area but also on localization of the auditory area in the superior temporal gyrus. One of their strongest pieces of evidence against an auditory center in the temporal lobe was their monkey known as the “Tame One,” who had received large bilateral temporal lobe lesions (ªgure 5.4). This animal was demonstrated at several international meetings and its lack of deafness was attested to by an examining committee at the 1887 meeting of the Neurological Society. More relevant to our story than this absence of deafness were the striking changes in postoperative behavior that Brown and Schäfer described: A remarkable change is manifested in the disposition of the Mon- key. Prior to the operations he was very wild and even ªerce, assaulting any person who teased or tried to handle him. Now, he voluntarily approaches all persons indifferently, allows himself to be handled, or even to be teased or slapped without making any attempt at retaliation or endeavoring to escape. His memory and intelligence seem deªcient.

This is the case not only with inanimate objects, but also with persons and with his fellow Mon- keys. And even after having examined an object in this way with the utmost care and deliberation, he will, on again coming across the same object accidentally even a few minutes afterwards, go through exactly the same process, as if he had forgotten his previous experiments. He appears no longer to discriminate between the different kinds of food e.g., he no longer picks out the currants from a dish of food but devours everything just as it happens to come. He still however possesses the sense of taste, for when given a raisin which has been partially ªlled with quinine he shows evident signs of distaste, and refuses to eat the fruit. . . The authors concluded that On localization of functions the experiment throws no direct light . . . a general depression of the intellectual faculties has resulted and a condition resembling idiocy produced. Schäfer described his ªndings on the visual and auditory cortical areas in several further publications and repeatedly used this animal’s normal hearing as an argument against the existence of a temporal lobe auditory center. However, he never again mentioned the strange effects of removal of the temporal lobes except to say that it produced “idiocy.” 18 Given the disputes over the location of the basic cortical sensory areas and the fact that even Schäfer himself never referred again to the effects of temporal lobe removal, it is not surprising that these observations were lost. They were rediscovered only ten years after they were repeated by two Chicago Scientists, Klüver and Bucy. The Klüver-Bucy Syndrome Heinrich Klüver was a professor at the University of Chicago for over ªfty years and was responsible for the development of many of the modern 189 Beyond Striate Cortex"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"techniques for studying visual cognition in monkeys. 19 He was also quite interested in the effects of mescaline on perception, particularly on himself, and wrote a little book called Mescal, the Divine Plant. 20 Klüver thought that the hallucinations or aura that sometimes precede a temporal lobe seizure resembled a mescaline-induced hallucination, and on that basis he speculated that the temporal lobes might be the site of action of mescaline. To test this possibility he arranged for the neurosurgeon Paul Bucy to remove the temporal lobes of several monkeys to see whether, postoperatively, mescaline still induced behav- iors suggesting mescaline hallucination. 21 The effects of mescaline seem to have been the same after the temporal lobe removals as before, but the undrugged temporal lobectomized monkeys showed a strange and intriguing set of behavioral changes. This set of symptoms became known as the Klüver-Bucy syndrome. Klüver summarized them as follows 22 : 1. . . . [P]sychic blindness or visual agnosia . . . the ability to recognize and detect the meaning of objects on visual criteria alone seems to be lost although the animal exhibits no or at least no gross defects in the ability to discriminate visually. 2. . . . [S]trong oral tendencies in the sense that the monkey insists on examining all objects by mouth. 3. There is an excessive tendency to attend and react to every visual stimulus. 4. . . .

All expressions of emotions . . . may be completely lost. 5. . . . [S]triking increase in the amount and diversity of sexual behavior. It exhibits forms of autosexual, heterosexual and homo- sexual behavior rarely or never seen in normal monkeys. 190 Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"6. . . . [A] remarkable change in dietary habits . . . [particularly] . . . a tendency to consume large quantities of . . . [meat]. Ten years after his original study, Klüver came upon the 1881 Brown and Schäfer paper with the description of the monkey with the bilateral temporal lobectomy, and wrote: It is evident that the observations of Brown and Schäfer agree fully with ours, particularly with reference to the picture of psychic blindness, the oral tendencies, the “hypermetamorphosis” and the striking changes in emotional behavior. It is evident that the bilat- eral lesions . . . were comparable in extent to the lesions produced in our experimental animals. Klüver and Bucy had reported that they could not produce their syn- drome or any of its components by lesions smaller than ones of both temporal lobes, and suggested that the syndrome was a unitary one that could not be “fractionated.” However, about ten years later that is exactly what began to happen. Fractionation of the Klüver-Bucy Syndrome By the 1920s, with the fall of association psychology and the rise of Gestalt psychology, the pendulum began to swing away from cortical localization of all but primary sensory and motor functions and toward the antilocalizationist views in the earlier holistic tradition of Friedrich Goltz and Jacques Loeb. 23 Attacks on the association of visual agnosia with damage to visual association cortex, and even on the reality of visual agnosia, became widespread. 24 The twentieth-century ªgure most associated with antilocalization and yet, para- doxically, the teacher of almost all the next generation’s leading cortical local- izers, was Karl Lashley. 191 Beyond Striate Cortex"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Karl Lashley was the ªrst director of the Yerkes Laboratory of Primate Biology in Orange Park, Florida. This was the ªrst U.S. primate center and a joint Harvard-Yale enterprise, Harvard providing the director and Yale provid- ing the laboratory. 25 Until moving to Orange Park, Lashley spent much of his experimental career failing to ªnd evidence for cortical localization of complex behavior in rats. 26 He now set out to resolve the controversy over the localiza- tion of visual agnosia by studying the effects of lesions of visual association cortex in monkeys. He tested the monkeys on a rather extensive battery that included tests of sensory status and of visual learning and memory. 27 He had planned to destroy Brodmann’s areas 18 and 19 but, as detailed in his classic attack on cytoarchitectonics, 28 he could not identify them reliably. Therefore, he made “no pretense of dealing with a distinct anatomic or functional area,” and instead removed “a band of cortex encircling the striate area and extending for an indeterminate distance beyond the lunate sulcus.” He coined the term “prestriate region” for this band. 29 The prestriate lesions in his animals included “not less than 60% of Brodmann’s areas 18 and 19” (his estimate), and not much more (my estimate). His “indeterminate” distance included some limited encroachment into poste- rior parietal and posterior temporal cortex. He found that these lesions 30 : did not produce any trace of object agnosia . . . [or] . . . any signiªcant amnesia for . . . color or form . . . interruption of transcortical associative connections is therefore not the cause of visual agnosia [and] comparison of the experimental and clinical evidence indicates that visual agnosia cannot be ascribed to uncom- plicated loss of prestriate tissue. These apparently conclusive antilocalization implications were reversed soon after the arrival in Orange Park in the late 1940s of two graduate students, Josephine Semmes (later Blum) from Yale and Kao Liang Chow from Harvard. They were joined by Karl Pribram, who had trained in neurosurgery with Bucy at Chicago. In a joint study they made lesions much larger than Lashley’s, 192 Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"encroaching further into the parietal lobe and much more anteriorly and ventrally into the temporal lobe. These succeeded in producing psychic blind- ness, that is, severe deªcits in visual discrimination learning (as well as some tactile learning deªcits that will be discussed later). Since the locus common to their lesions and Klüver and Bucy’s was temporal cortex, they surmised that temporal cortex must be crucial for visual learning. Chow then went on to show that, indeed, “lesions of the lateral surface of the temporal lobe and especially the middle temporal gyrus, produced visual deªcits,” whereas lesions of adjacent areas did not. 31 In these studies the cortical lesions that led to the visual deªcits did not produce any of the other components of the Klüver-Bucy syndrome such as tameness and changes in sexual and eating behaviors. Rather, as Pribram and Bagshaw 32 demonstrated, these components, without the visual difªculties, followed lesions of the amygdala and adjacent cortex. Thus, the original Brown-Schäfer/Klüver-Bucy syndrome was fractionated into visual discrimi- nation difªculties after temporal cortical damage and other, “motivational” symptoms after amygdala damage. Pribram continued his studies of cortical function in monkeys ªrst in John Fulton’s laboratory at Yale and then in a new laboratory established for him at the Institute of Living, a private mental hospital in Connecticut. He was joined by Mortimer Mishkin from McGill University; they further localized the visual components of the Klüver-Bucy syndrome to the middle and inferior temporal gyri. 33 This region became known as inferotemporal cortex or, more recently, inferior temporal (IT) cortex. In the mid-1950s, research on the behavioral effects of IT lesions was also continuing at Orange Park and in Harry Harlow’s laboratory at the University of Wisconsin. By the end of the decade the behavioral effects of IT cortex lesions were being studied in laboratories all across the country (e.g., those of Chow at University of Chicago, the Wilsons at Bryn Mawr, Mishkin at NIMH, Donald Meyer at Ohio State University) as well as in England (Weiskrantz at Cambridge University, Ettlinger at Queens Square, London). Much of this effort was directed toward characterizing the visual learning deªcit that followed IT lesions. This research has been reviewed by Gross and Dean. 34 193 Beyond Striate Cortex"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Inferior Temporal Cortex Joins the Visual System Beyond characterization of the IT deªcit, three major advances led to the current period of research on IT cortex. The ªrst was a set of developments that brought IT cortex into anatomical and functional relation with the rest of the visual system. It had long been supposed from degeneration and strychnine neuronography studies that IT cortex might receive visual information from the pulvinar (to which both the superior colliculus and striate cortex project) and from striate cortex over a corticocortical multisynaptic pathway. 35 In 1965 the cortical pathway was established by Kuypers et al. using silver degeneration techniques, as involving two successive synaptic stages in prestriate cortex. 36 The puzzle was that both large lesions of the pulvinar and attempted interrup- tion of the putative corticocortical pathway repeatedly failed to produce the IT deªcit on visual learning. 37 One problem was that complete and selective interruption of the corticocortical pathway required complete prestriate lesions, which were technically impossible both because of the extensive infolding in this area and the impossibility of avoiding massive damage to the underlying visual radiations. In 1966 Mishkin solved this conundrum by disconnecting IT and striate cortex using a crossed-lesion paradigm: the combination of a striate lesion in one hemisphere, an IT lesion in the other hemisphere, and section of the forebrain commissures. 38 The unilateral IT lesion alone had no effect because bilateral lesions are required to produce the IT deªcit on visual learning. The unilateral striate lesion alone had no effect because the remaining striate cortex could send visual information to the IT cortex on the same side over the ipsilateral corticocortical route and to the contralateral IT. Lesions of IT alone had no effect on visual learning because each IT cortex still received input from the ipsilateral striate cortex. Similarly, any two of Mishkin’s lesion were inef- fective. However, the combination of all three lesions resulted in complete interruption of the pathway between striate and IT cortex, and therefore yielded a severe impairment on visual learning. 194 Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"At this time little was known about the visual association cortex or prestriate region lying between (and connecting) striate and IT cortex. As described above, evidence was accumulating from a variety of other species for visuotopically organized cortical areas in addition to striate cortex. Then Cowey demonstrated a visuotopically organized area in the squirrel monkey adjacent to striate cortex, area V2. 39 A new phase of visual physiology began in the 1970s, when Jon Kaas and John Allman, initially in Woolsey’s lab, began their now classic series of studies of extrastriate visual cortex in the owl monkey. 40 They used single-neu- ron recording rather than evoked potentials and soon freed themselves of the assumption of only two or three visual areas, rapidly ªnding an amazing multiplicity of visuotopically organized visual areas extending well into the temporal and parietal lobes. Similar extrastriate visual areas were then mapped in the macaque by a number of laboratories, including those of Zeki, Van Essen, Ungerleider, Desimone, and myself, eventually ªlling much of posterior asso- ciation cortex with over two dozen visual areas 41 (see ªgures 5.1 and 5.6). A second major development in understanding IT cortex was the begin- ning of its functional subdivision with the discovery by Iwai and Mishkin that it could be divided into a more anterior area corresponding to von Bonin and Bailey’s cytoarchitectonic area TE and a more posterior area they called area TEO 42 (see ªgure 5.1). This latter region has also been called foveal prestriate cortex and posterior IT cortex. Iwai and Mishkin found that TEO lesions had a greater effect on single-pattern discrimination tasks, whereas TE lesions had a greater effect on concurrent discriminations in which the animal is required to learn several discriminations in parallel. They suggested that these results implied greater mnemonic functions for TE and more perceptual functions for TEO. Alan Cowey and I then set out to characterize further the differences between the effects of these two lesions. We had been together at Cambridge University as Larry Weiskrantz’s graduate students. We were joined by two graduate students, Richard Manning, now a research scientist in the U.S. 195 Beyond Striate Cortex"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Medical Corps, and David Bender, now professor of physiology at SUNY Buffalo. We found that lesions of TE and of TEO produced a number of different effects generally supportive of this mnemonic-perceptual distinction. For example, TEO lesions relative to those of TE resulted in greater impairment on single-object and pattern-discrimination learning tasks, less impairment on concurrent visual learning tasks, more disruption by irrelevant stimuli, and less sensitivity to both shock punishment and partial reinforcement. 43 More recent work suggests that there is a locus especially critical for visual memory in the anterior ventral portion of inferior temporal cortex, that is, in perirhinal cortex, areas 35 and 36. Perirhinal cortex may serve as a major gateway for the pathway between IT cortex and the hippocampus by way of entorhinal cortex. Interactions along some or all of this pathway appear crucial for facilitating long-term storage of visual information in IT cortex. 44 The third major development was the beginning of studies of the activity of single neurons in IT cortex. For this topic, I now shift into an autobiographi- cal mode. Early Studies of the Activity of Single Neurons in IT Cortex When I came to MIT as a postdoctoral fellow, I abandoned my previous research area, the frontal lobes, because I despaired of the possibility of doing anything meaningful with them in terms of psychology, anatomy, or physiology. (The successful research program of Patricia Goldman-Rakic 45 demonstrates how wrong this judgment was.) Instead, I turned to the visual functions of the temporal lobe. I started some lesion experiments (mentioned above) and thought it might be valuable to carry out recording studies in parallel. However, I had never done any single-neuron recording and I had no equipment to do so. At this point Hans-Lukas Teuber, head of the Psychology Department, offered to provide the necessary funds and, at least as important, introduced me to George Gerstein, a postdoctoral fellow in Walter Rosenbliths’s Communi- cation Biophysics Laboratory in the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT. 196 Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Gerstein was working on the auditory system of cats and was expert in neuronal recording and analytic techniques. He and I prepared to record from IT cortex in awake monkeys during the performance of visual discrimination tasks because, as Gerstein often chanted, “the cortex dissolves in anesthesia.” We decided to begin by recording surface potentials from IT cortex during visual discrimination learning on the grounds that this would help us to know what to look for with single-unit recording. We found, as Chow 46 had earlier, a few wiggles in the records that mostly indicated, at least to me, the futility of the electrographic approach. 47 In 1964, before we recorded from our ªrst inferotemporal neuron, Gerstein left for the University of Pennsylvania. Since he was now a long-distance collaborator, we decided to radically simplify the planned experiment so that I could carry it out without him. The simplest experiment we could think of was just to ask whether IT neurons responded to visual stimuli and to use anesthetized animals. Since we were in the home of the double dissociation paradigm, 48 we also used auditory stimuli and, in addition, recorded from the superior temporal gyrus, believed to be an auditory analogue of IT cortex. Soon I was joined by another postdoctoral fellow, Peter Schiller, who was trained as a clinical psychologist and had worked on visual masking. Even for the time, our experiment was certainly simple enough, if not simplistic. For example, the standard stimuli we used were diffuse light, clicks, and tone bursts. Moreover, the eyes were uncorrected and merely covered with a viscous silicone ºuid to prevent drying out, and the fovea and other retinal landmarks were not located. The animals were anesthetized and immobilized. By vigorous averaging of the responses to 100 or more stimulus presen- tations, we managed to get IT responses to diffuse light in about a quarter of our sample; no IT cells responded to auditory stimuli. We found the opposite pattern in the superior temporal gyrus. For “about 30 units” in IT we tried “moving and stationary circles, edges and bars of light projected on a screen” and found no responses and therefore “an absence of evidence for receptive ªelds.” 49 We interpreted these results as reºecting one or more of the following: (a) “an organization fundamentally different from that found” by Hubel and 197 Beyond Striate Cortex"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Weisel in areas 17, 18, and 19 of the cat; (b) failure to use sufªciently adequate, optimal, or appropriate stimuli; or (c) use of anesthesia. So we decided to return to our original plan of recording from awake behaving animals and, because of some concurrent experiments on attention and IT lesions, to study unit activity during attention rather than during visual learning. We set up a board in front of the monkeys with little windows or peep holes to which we could apply our eye or present such objects as a ªnger, a burning Q-Tip, or a bottle brush. Most of the units responded vigorously to such stimuli, and we classiªed them as attention units because they ªred to any stimulus that seemed to draw the animal’s attention, or, at least, that would elicit continued staring at the stimulus as reºected on an electrooculogram. These observations were made in several monkeys and with a number of collaborators, such as Peter Schiller, George Gerstein, and Alan Cowey, and were published over a decade later. We interpreted these results as “suggesting that these units either were involved in some attentional mechanism, had foveal receptive ªelds, or both.” 50 In 1965 I moved to the Psychology Department at Harvard and was joined by Carlos Eduardo Rocha-Miranda from Brazil (who had once worked with Wade Marshall) and by David Bender, from SUNY Buffalo. We were not sure how to test the “some attentional mechanism” hypothesis, so we decided instead to test the foveal receptive ªeld idea by trying once more to plot receptive ªelds in an immobilized animal. This time we used nitrous oxide and oxygen for anesthesia and we set out to teach ourselves how to use an ophthalmoscope and a retinoscope, ªnd the fovea, use contact lenses, measure expired CO 2 , and on and on. (The story of this “learning experience” deserves a stand-up comedy routine. One example: we couldn’t ªnd instructions on using a retinoscope that we could understand until we discovered some in a ºight surgeon’s manual that started: “aim the beam at the center of the patient’s chest, then follow the buttons up . . .”) It is interesting to note some other developments during 1965–1969, the period in which we carried out these experiments. In the same building in which I had worked when I came to MIT, Jerry Lettvin was continuing his 198 Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"work on bug detectors in the frog’s retina and lecturing (tongue in cheek) on “grandmother cells.” Across the river in Harvard Medical School, Hubel and Wiesel had carried out their seminal work on lower- and higher-order complex cells in areas 18 and 19 of the cat. Polish psychologist Jerzy Konorski published his Integrative Activity of the Brain, in which he hypothesized a set of gnostic units, neurons that “represented unitary perceptions.” He suggested that visual gnostic units were located in inferior temporal cortex, and as likely examples he mentioned units coding faces, hands, and facial expressions. I was well aware of these ideas not only from a stay in his Warsaw laboratory in 1961 but also from reviewing his book. 51 Given this ambience, it is not surprising that we were prepared to ªnd IT cells that ªred selectively to complex stimuli such as hands and faces. The ªrst such cell that we studied in detail was one most responsive to a hand (ªgure 5.5). When we wrote the ªrst draft of an account of this work for Science, we did not have the nerve to include this hand cell until Teuber urged us to do so. What is perhaps more surprising was that for more than a decade there were no published attempts to conªrm or deny these and our other early basic results, Figure 5.5 Examples of shapes used to stimulate an inferior temporal cortex neuron “ap- parently having very complex trigger features. The stimuli are arranged from left to right in order of increasing ability to drive the neuron from none (1) or little (2 and 3) to maxi- mum (6). . . . The use of [these] stimuli was begun one day when, having failed to drive a unit with any light stimulus, we waved a hand at the stimulus screen and elicited a very vigorous response from the previously unresponsive neuron. . . . We then spent the next 12 hr testing various paper cutouts in an attempt to ªnd the trigger feature for this unit. When the entire set of stimuli used were ranked according to the strength of the response that they produced, we could not ªnd a simple physical dimension that correlated with this rank order. However, the rank order of adequate stimuli did correlate with similarity (for us) to the shadow of a monkey hand” (Gross et al., 1972). 199 Beyond Striate Cortex"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"such as that IT cells have large bilateral ªelds that include the fovea and are not visuotopically organized. And unlike Panizza, the discoverer of visual cortex in the nineteenth century, we did not publish in obscure journals or from an unknown institution. Perhaps because of the general skepticism, we did not ourselves publish a full account of a face-selective neuron until 1981. Soon thereafter, a ºood of papers on such cells appeared, beginning with one by Perrett, Rolls, and Caan from Oxford. Our basic receptive ªeld ªndings were also ªrst conªrmed at that time. 52 To continue our genealogical subtheme, Edmund Rolls was Cowey’s student, David Perrett and Woodburn Caan were Rolls’s students, and Desimone was my graduate student and Mishkin’s post- doctoral student. The laboratories of Rolls in Oxford, Perrett in St. Andrews, and Desimone at the National Institute of Mental Health are today among the most active centers of research on IT cortex. In the last decade, and therefore beyond our purview, major advances in single-neuron studies of IT cortex have included studies of effects of attention, short-term and long-term memory, speciªcity for color and faces, functional architecture, and relations with frontal cortex. 53 A Lost Observation On Parietal Cortex The second set of observations lost in the din of the late nineteenth-century battle between Ferrier and his opponents were made by Ferrier on the effects of lesions of the angular gyrus (posterior parietal cortex) that he thought caused blindness (see ªgure 1.21). Here is what Ferrier and Yeo had to say about the recovery from this lesion (case 8): On the fourth day there were some indications of returning vision. A piece of orange was held before it, whereupon it came forward in a groping manner and tried to lay hold, at ªrst but missed repeatedly . . . On the ªfth day . . . it was evidently able to see its food, but constantly missed laying hold of it [my italics], putting its hand beyond it or short of it . . . On the sixth day . . . it was able to 200 Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"pick up grains of rice scattered on the ºoor, but always with uncertainty as to their exact position . . . Four weeks after the operation . . . the same want of precision was still seen as regards its power of putting its hands on objects it wished to pick up . . . At this date when it was walking on a table it tumbled off, hav- ing come too near the edge without seeming to be aware of the fact. From this description it seems clear that, rather than being blind, this monkey was having problems localizing stimuli and reaching for them. How- ever, since Ferrier had clearly been wrong in localizing the visual center in the parietal lobe, these observations of what he called blindness were usually attributed to some artifact, such as damaging the optic radiations or transiently interfering with occipital function, and then were almost forgotten. In fact Ferrier’s opponents, Brown and Schäfer, had made an essentially similar, and even more forgotten, observation, noting that after bilateral posterior parietal lesions, their monkey “would evidently see and run up to [a raisin], but then often fail to ªnd it . . .” 54 Parietal Lesions in Humans Thirty years later, at the end of World War I, Sir Gordon Holmes described a group of veterans with disturbances of visual and spatial orientation after bilateral posterior parietal lesions due to penetrating missile wounds. Their symptoms included deªcits in reaching and pointing to visual targets, avoiding obstacles, learning and remembering routes, judging distance and size, recog- nizing spatial relations, ªxating a target, and following a moving stimulus. In contrast, their ability to recognize objects and other cognitive functions were essentially normal. Holmes’s careful observations established the critical role of posterior parietal cortex in visuospatial functions. His paper was also one of the very few on parietal damage in humans or monkeys that cited Ferrier’s early observations on visuospatial deªcits after parietal lesions in monkeys. 201 Beyond Striate Cortex"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"The next major development was the realization by W. R. Brain, Lord Brain, long-time editor of the journal Brain, that unilateral posterior parietal lesions, particularly of the right hemisphere, can produce dramatic neglect of the contralateral side of space. By 1953, the time of Malcolm Critchley’s classic monograph The Parietal Lobes, it was clear that a variety of complex visual, visuospatial, and visuomotor symptoms occurred after damage to parietal cortex in humans. 55 Parietal Cortex Lesions in the Monkey: 20th Century The ªrst twentieth-century investigations of posterior parietal cortex function in monkeys were carried out in the 1930s by T. C. Ruch and J. F. Fulton. They found that lesions of this area produced impairments on roughness and weight-discrimination learning. They interpreted these results as indicating that posterior parietal cortex was a somatosensory association area, following the idea that the regions adjacent to each primary sensory area, somatosensory cortex in this case, had the function of developing sensory information into perceptions. Further support for this theory came from studies in Lashley’s laboratory in the Yerkes Primate Center, and then in Pribram’s laboratory at the Institute of Living. These studies continued to emphasize the role of posterior parietal cortex in tactile learning and indeed, viewed this cortex as playing a role for tactile learning analogous to that of inferior temporal cortex for visual learning. Visuospatial disturbances after parietal lesions were some- times noticed but usually dismissed as side effects. 56 The propensity to dismiss the visuospatial effects of posterior parietal lesions as side effects changed with the arrival at Pribram’s laboratory of George Ettlinger from the Institute of Neurology, Queens Square, London. He had studied humans with parietal lesions and was aware of Ferrier’s earlier obser- vations on the effects of such lesions in monkeys. Ettlinger stressed that the lesions in monkeys produced visual orientation and reaching deªcits, and increased sensitivity to stimulus-response separation. He contended that these deªcits were the bases of the difªculties in tactile discrimination learning. By 202 Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"the late 1970s several other workers had moved away from the stress on a tactile learning deªcit and began to view the deªcit as a supramodal spatial one. The beginning of microelectrode studies of parietal cortex tended to strengthen this notion. 57 The Microelectrode Arrives at Posterior Parietal Cortex Single-neuron analysis of posterior parietal cortex began with the work of Juhani Hyvärinen and his colleagues in Helsinki starting in 1970. 58 They found cells that ªred: . . . when a sensory stimulus which interested the animal was placed in a speciªc location in space where it became the target of the monkey’s gaze or manual reaching, tracking or manipulation . . . Some cells were clearly related to eye movements whereas others appeared to discharge in response to visual sensory stimuli. They interpreted their results as indicating that posterior parietal cortex was involved in the visuospatial guidance of movement, thereby providing an explanation for the visuospatial deªcit after parietal lesions. However, their procedures were somewhat naturalistic: eye and arm movements and position were not measured or controlled, and stimulus presentation was often informal. Soon after, Vernon Mountcastle and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins explored similar phenomena, and did so under greater experimental control. They found cells speciªcally related to projection of the arm, to hand manipu- lation, to visual tracking, and to visual ªxation, as well as cells with more complex properties. 59–61 At least in their early papers, they claimed that very few if any of their cells were “directly activated” by visual stimuli. Rather, they described their parietal cells as 62, 63 : . . . function[ing] in a command fashion, directing visual attention to and exploration of the immediately surrounding extrapersonal space. 203 Beyond Striate Cortex"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"and . . . execut[ing] a matching function between the neural signals of the nature of objects and the internal drive states of the organism, and contain[ing] a neural apparatus for the direction of visual attention to objects of interest and for shifting the focus of attention from one to another. Michael Goldberg and David Robinson at the National Institutes of Health then demonstrated that Mountcastle and his colleagues were quite wrong: many posterior parietal neurons did in fact respond to visual stimuli and did so in the absence of movement, thereby unambiguously falsifying the “motor command” hypothesis. They did ªnd that the visual responses could often be enhanced by the animal’s attention, but this did not necessarily involve any eye movement at all. Thus Goldberg and Robinson returned posterior parietal cortex to the visual system where Ferrier ªrst placed it. 64 The next decade saw several further signiªcant developments on these issues. As they are outside of our time frame, I mention only two of them. First, Andersen and his colleagues showed that the visual responses of posterior parietal neurons can be modulated by eye position, and therefore an ensemble of such cells carries information about visual targets in spatial coordinates. Second, it became clear that there are a number of different visual areas in the posterior parietal cortex that appear to play different roles in a variety of visual and visuospatial functions, such as the analysis of stimulus movement, the coding of space, and the visual control and monitoring of eye and hand movement. 65 Coda: Two Cortical Visual Systems By the early 1980s, the end of the period covered by this book, more than a dozen cortical visual areas had been described, extending visual cortex from the occipital lobe well into the temporal and parietal lobes. In 1982, Leslie Unger- 204 Chapter 5"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"leider and Mortimer Mishkin proposed a powerful and highly inºuential theory that brought considerable order to this plethora. They proposed that the various extrastriate visual areas could be grouped into two processing “streams” or “systems.” The ªrst was a dorsal pathway from striate cortex, through a set of dorsal prestriate areas to posterior parietal cortex, forming a system for spatial vision. The second was a ventral pathway from striate cortex through a set of ventral prestriate area to inferior temporal cortex, forming a system for object vision. Their theory had two major roots. The ªrst was the conªrmation and extension in Mishkin’s laboratory of the two lost nineteenth-century observa- tions, that inferior temporal lesions produce a psychic blindness for recognizing objects and that posterior parietal lesions produce a deªcit in spatial vision. The second root was the proposal made in the late 1960s by Gerald Schneider (my ªrst graduate student) and Colwyn Trevarthen that visual function could be divided into what? (or identity) functions and where? (or localization) functions, and that these two functions were subserved by different brain structures. 66 Ungerleider and Mishkin’s “two visual systems” has sometimes been simpliªed to the point of caricature by others, and therefore several caveats should be kept in mind, most of which were explicit or implicit in their original or subsequent formulations. 67 First, both the dorsal and ventral systems are interconnected along their entire course and must continually interact; that is, they are “bound” to each other just as objects are to their locations. Second, each is undoubtedly subdivided. For example, evidence exists for two streams within the dorsal system, one specialized for space and proceeding to posterior parietal cortex and one specialized for analysis of stimulus movement and proceeding to the superior temporal polysensory (STP) area in the anterior portion of the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus. 68 Third, even within a stream or substream, processing is probably parallel as well as serial. Thus, the analysis of form and color proceeds somewhat separately in the early stages of the ventral system, 69 and in the later stages there are several routes to anterior IT cortex. 70 See ªgure 5.6. A fourth point to remember about the two cortical visual systems schema is that the dorsal and ventral streams do not end in parietal and temporal cortex. 205 Beyond Striate Cortex"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Figure 5.6 Visual processing pathways in monkeys.
