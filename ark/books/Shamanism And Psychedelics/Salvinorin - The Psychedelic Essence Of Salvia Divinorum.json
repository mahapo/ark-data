Salvinorin A is the most potent naturally occurring psychedelic known, and in many ways the most enigmatic. Those using salvinorin A find it frequently induces experiences of an intensity level which is an order of magnitude beyond those experienced with any other psychedelic, even DMT. The dimensions visited under the influence of salvinorin A are described as extremely bizarre and varied, with several aspects not common to other psychedelic experiences. Many who have used salvinorin A find the experience extremely unnerving, frightening and overly intense. Most have no desire to repeat the experience. although there are a few who have taken a liking to this entheogen and are working to develop a relationship with it. Early experiments by pioneering psychonauts suggest that access to benignly expansive realms, as well as new and very real dangers. are possible with this material. Salvinorin A also presents us with an entirely novel chemical structure for a psychedelic drug. It's the first psychedelic diterpene to be discovered, while nearly all other known psychedelics are alkaloids. The following pages discuss the history and botany of the rare and little-known plant. Salvia divinorum, and the recent isolation of its immensely powerful active principal, salvinorin A. Since the first human experiment with this substance three years ago. salvinorin A has generated significant interest within the psychedelic community, and promises to challenge our basic understanding of consciousness and the functioning of the mind. Presented here are results of the early human experiments with salvinorin A, many in the form of first-hand reports which give lucid descriptions of the bizarre and multifaceted worlds of Salvia divinorum. Salvia Divinorum: The Plant and its History file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (2 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum Salvia divinorum is used by the Mazatec Indians living in remote regions of Oaxaca, where it first came to the awareness of western researchers in the first half of this century. Little is known regarding the plant's use before this period, although there is some indication that it may have been used by the Aztecs in earlier times. The first description of this plant in western literature was made by Swedish anthropologist Jean Basset Johnson in 19391. Johnson. who was investigating psilocybe mushroom use amongst the Mazatecs, also noted their use of Salvia divinorum in healing ceremonies. Salvia divinorum is a very rare plant, being found in only a few ravine locations in the Sierra Mazateca mountains. The plant is easily propagated by cuttings, and during the past few decades it has made its way into numerous botanical gardens and private collections around the world. Virtually all of the Salvia divinorum in circulation has been vegetatively propagated from two parent clones of this species. The first specimen was collected by R. Gordon Wasson in 1962. A second, so called \"palatable\" strain was collected by Bret Blosser in 1991. The \"palatable\" variety is actually still quite bitter, although less so than the Wasson clone. There are a few other strains being maintained, some of which were grown from seed, but these are not in general circulation. Cuttings of Salvia divinorum placed in a jar of water will begin rooting within two to three weeks. When the roots have reached about 1\", the cuttings may he transferred to pots. Salvia divinorum likes humidity and moisture, moderate but indirect sunlight and warm temperatures. In most parts of the United States it will grow best in a greenhouse and appreciates frequent misting. Too much sunlight will turn the leaves a pale green. If the leaves curl up and dry at the edges, it is a sign that the temperature is too warm for the amount of humidity they are receiving. The plants should be kept from freezing at all times, although they may grow back after a light frost that does not freeze the roots. Salvia divinorum grows into a vine-like bush with branches frequently reaching 7 to 10 feet in height before bending over under their own weight, often rooting where they fall. The plant has jagged- edged leaves that reach 4\" to 6\" in length. The amount of leaf is typically sparse in proportion to the stems, and often the plants have a slightly straggle appearance. The stems are square-shaped and hollow with winged edges. Under proper growing conditions the leaves have a beautifully deep, rich, almost velvet- like sheen, and appear quite sensuous. In the fall Salvia divinorum produces delicate flowers with white corollas and purple calyxes. Salvia divinorum sets seed rather infrequently, and only on rare occasions have these seeds proven to be viable. It is thought by many botanists that Salvia divinorum is a cultigen. It is not known to exist in the wild, and the few patches that are known in the Sierra Mazateca appear to be the result of deliberate planting. A Mazatec shaman informed Wasson that the Indians believe the plant is foreign to their region and do not know from where it came. And if Salvia divinorum is a hybrid, there are no commonly held theories on what its prospective parents may be. Amongst the Mazatecs, Salvia divinorum (Diviner's sage) is known under such names as ska Maria Pastora and Hierba Maria, which translate as \"the herb of Mary\" or \"leaves of Mary the Shepherdess\". In a recent paper, Jonathan 0tt has noted that the Mazatecs lack an indigenous name for Salvia divinorum, file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (3 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum both the Christian theme of Mary, as well as sheep, having been introduced to the region during the Spanish conquest. The Mazatecs also list a method of consuming this plant that does not efficiently utilize its psychoactive content, and seem to be generally unaware of its tremendous potency. Based on this information, and the likelihood of its being a cultigen, Ott has suggested that Salvia divinorum may be a post-conquest introduction to the Sierra Mazateca. However, it has also been suggested, initially by R. Gordon Wasson, that Salvia divinorum may be the Aztec plant Pipiltzintzintli, an entheogen that was briefly described by a 17th century Spanish friar. Ott has found that the little information available regarding Pipiltzintzintli supports this hypothesis, while ruling out several other plants that have been suggested as candidates for this Aztec sacrament. R. Gordon Wasson, the famed ethnobotanist who introduced psilocybe mushrooms to western society, was also the first to personally describe an experience with Salvia divinorum. In July of 1961 he participated in a healing ceremony performed by a Mazatecan curandera. Wasson ingested the squeezed juice of 34 pairs of leaves, and described the results as \"coming on sooner (than the mushrooms), being less sweeping, and lasting a shorter time. It did not go beyond the initial effects of the mushrooms - dancing colors in elaborate, three- dimensional designs.\" In 1962 Wasson was joined in Oaxaca by Swiss pharmacologist Albert Hofmann, inventor of LSD, who also first isolated psilocybin from mushrooms gathered in this same region. Hofmann brought an alcohol extract of Salvia divinorum back to Switzerland where he attempted to isolate the active component. He was unsuccessful, finding the extract to no longer be active, and suggested that the plant's active principal was unstable. The Discovery of Salvinorin A There was little research performed on Salvia divinorum during the following two decades. Salvinorin A was first isolated in 1982 by Alfredo Ortega, while performing a systematic chemical search for novel terpenoid compounds within the genus salvia. Ortega's search was not related to, and did not investigate, this plant's psychoactive properties. A group led by Leander Valdes, who was attempting to discover the psychoactive component of Salvia divinorum, separately isolated the same compound in 39g. The Valdes group, however, only tested salvinorin A by administering injections to mice. Although these experiments suggested that salvinorin A was the main psychoactive component of the plant. the Valdes group remained unaware of its extraordinarily potent effects in humans. In June of 1993 Daniel Siebert discovered the strikingly powerful effects of salvinorin A, following the smoking of an extract which he had produced. Prior to producing the extract Siebert had been experimenting with ingestion of Salvia divinorum and smoking the dried leaves. Although these experiments allowed him to enter a psychedelic world, he felt that a much vaster dimension was waiting beyond the state produced by these methods of consumption. He began a series of experiments producing concentrated extracts and trying various methods of administration, During his experiments, Siebert felt the plant's spirit was issuing a kind of file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (4 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum intuitional guidance, encouraging him to continue with the extraction process and discover a means of achieving a full Salvia experience. Pure salvinorin A is desirable because it permits one to experience intense psychedelic effects which are often elusive when using the whole plant material. In particular, when smoking dried Salvia divinorum leaf, many people fail to achieve more than a mild effect, although a few find this method quite satisfactory. Upon his discovery of two terpenoid compounds, Valdes named them divinorin A and divinorin B. However, since Ortega had previously discovered and named the first of these compounds. the name salvinorin A is currently used for the plants primary terpenoid component. Salvinorin B, which represents about 4% of the plant's terpenoids, did not turn out to be psychoactive in Valdes' animal studies, however, it has yet to be tested in humans. Valdes has also isolated other terpenoids from Salvia divinorum. In his book, Pharmako/Poeia, Dale Pendell indicates that one may need to work with the plant for some time before feeling its effects. \"The Ally - She can be shy. Sometimes she has to get to know you for a while before she will come out and say hello. But once she appears, are there any who are more direct?\" When smoking dried Salvia divinorum leaf it is important that the entire quantity be consumed in one or two large inhalations if one hopes to obtain significant effects. Smoking it in the manner one normally smokes a joint usually produces no more than a mild buzz. Siebert found that leaves harvested during the warmer months of the year were at least twice as potent as those harvested during the winter. John Gruber of the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science recently performed HPLC tests which yielded between 1.5 and 2.2 mg. salvinorin A per gram of dried Salvia divinorum leaf with lower amounts appearing in the stems and traces in the roots. Earlier experiments by Siebert have yielded up to 4.4 mg. salvinorin A per gram of dried leaf. The dried leaf equals approximately 13% of the fresh weight. Siebert also discovered that when ingesting Salvia divinorum, its active components are absorbed primarily through contact with the oral mucosa. His experiments showed that significant entheogenic experiences were produced by chewing 8 to 10 large fresh leaves (3 grams each, fresh weight) and holding them in the mouth for 10 minutes, while quickly swallowing the file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (5 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum same amount of material produced no noticeable effects. In sessions where Salvia divinorum was administered by Mazatecan shamans, most westerners who reported definite psychoactive effects were given 50 to 100 leaves. Reports on the plant's psychoactivity were inconsistent, and much of what was absorbed by those who felt its effects may have been through the oral mucosa during the process of chewing and consuming the leaves. Shortly after discovering salvinorin A's effects, Siebert sent a sample to David Nichols who initiated a NovaScreenTM receptor site screening. The screening results were in contrast to those of all previously tested psychedelics. Salvinorin A did not affect any of the receptor sites tested, which included all of the likely known receptor sites for other psychedelics. Dosage and Method of Administration Salvinorin A can be efficiently consumed by inhaling the vaporized crystalline powder, or by smoking, providing the crystalline powder has been placed on a substrate such as dried Salvia divinorum leaf. Used in this manner, the effects of salvinorin A can be distinctly felt from as little as 200 to 500 mcg. Most who have tried salvinorin A have reported 'full\" effects at a range between 800 and 1200 mcg. The distinction of \"full\" effects is arbitrary, as the intensity and diversity of the experience increases with the dosage. It should also be noted that as with any substance, there are a few people who will be unusually sensitive to salvinorin A, and will require a smaller amount to produce the same level of effects. Ott has indicated that salvinorin A can also be taken sublingually, and is active in even smaller doses, with as little as 100 to 250 mcg. producing noticeable effects. Ott used a solution of salvinorin A in acetone in his sublingual tests, and also reported that DMSO can be used as a solvent for this purpose. By comparison, the most potent previously known natural psychedelics, 5-MeO-DMT and psilocin. are typically used in doses of 5 to 10 mg. Salvinorin A is approximately 10 times the potency of these compounds, and nearly as potent as the semi-synthetic psychedelic, LSD. The effects of salvinorin A intensify sharply as the dose is increased, as has been noted by several people who have used over 1 mg. A few have tried doses around 2 mg., and had experiences of ferocious intensity which they had no desire to repeat. The largest single dose reported is Siebert's initial smoking of approximately 2 mg. of salvinorin A. Most of the early experiments with salvinorin A were performed by inhaling the vaporized crystal using the following technique. The salvinorin A was placed on the center of a piece of thick aluminum foil, which was heated from below with a butane micro-torch or \"jet flame\" lighten As the salvinorin A turned to a white vapor, the vapors were inhaled through a 15mm diameter glass tube. This technique requires careful performance. If one inhales before the crystal has been melted, the solid material wilt be taken into the mouth and will not produce the desired effects. However, if one waits more than a file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (6 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum moment after the vapor begins to appear, it will disperse and be lost to the atmosphere. There were several reported misfires from people who were not successful in this procedure. Some of these people suspected the substance was not very potent, increased the dose, and were quite shocked by the intensity of what they were subsequently propelled into. I came across a simpler procedure for this process, which is to use a conventional hash oil pipe. A hash oil pipe is made by creating a bubble or bowl at one end of a glass tube, with an opening at the top. Although hash oil is no longer commonly available4 these pipes can occasionally be found in stores. A hash oil pipe allows better visibility of the melting and vaporization, and better confinement of the vaporized material against escaping without being inhaled. Even with a hash oil pipe the technique requires precision. The use of a micro-torch or \"jet flame\" lighter is essential, not only due to salvinorin A's high boiling point, but also because a conventional lighter will coat the outside of the pipe in carbon, obscuring visibility of the melting/vaporization process. I found that the flame must be continually moved over the bottom of the bowl until the material has melted. These torches are hot enough to cause the bowl to quickly expand and buckle if the flame is kept at one point on the bowl. This causes the solid salvinorin A crystals to disperse over a large area inside the bowl, which does not allow for efficient vaporization. It is important that only self-extinguishing torches or lighters are used in this process, as salvinorin A takes effect very rapidly. One does not want to be traveling through hyperspace while a lit torch is burning at their side. Recently salvinorin A has been distributed in another form which is much easier to use. The material I've used contains 1 mg. of salvinorin A, dissolved onto 25 mg. of dried and powdered Salvia divinorum leaf. This concentrate formulation is much easier to handle than the pure crystalline form. The concentrate formulation may be smoked in a regular pipe using a regular lighter. However, a dedicated pipe should be used for smoking salvinorin A, as subsequent smoking of other herbs in the same pipe may induce an unwanted journey. Individual doses can now be reasonably measured on a scale with 10 mg. (1/100 of a gram) resolution, such as the Ohaus Centogram quad- beam balance. I've prepared 1 mg. doses of salvinorin A by first weighing 50 mg. of the salvinorin A on Salvia divinorum leaf concentrate, and then visually dividing this amount into two equal piles. Anyone working with this material should be acutely aware that even small variations in the dose size can produce dramatic increases in the intensity of the experience. Pure crystalline salvinorin A requires a sophisticated analytical balance for the measurement of individual doses. I have used the salvinorin A on Salvia divinorum leaf formulation several times now, and have noticed no difference between this and vaporizing the same amount of material in pure crystalline form. Siebert also performed tests using other methods of administering pure salvinorin A. This included placing salvinorin A in the mouth, and dissolving salvinorin A in a solvent and spraying into the nose. The effectiveness of these methods varied widely with repeated applications of the same method. In some cases a large percentage of the material taken seemed to make its way into the bloodstream, at other times only minimal effects were produced. This presented a significant risk. If the dose was increased to the point where one would normally achieve \"full\" effects, (equivalent to smoking 1 mg.) there was a risk of absorbing a larger percentage of the material which could produce an experience of shocking intensity. This possibility led Siebert to suspend his research in this area. file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (7 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum There are currently a number of people in the psychedelic community experimenting with different methods of ingesting Salvia divinorum, including the oral administration of a crude extract. It is likely that a reliable method will soon be developed which allows one to experience fuller effects than can be easily obtained through chewing the whole leaves, but without the intensity and sudden onset of smoked salvinorin A. Warnings As mentioned earlier, most who have tried salvinorin A find its effects extremely unsettling, and have no desire to repeat the experience. This response comes from people who are highly experienced in the use of entheogens, including many who are writers or leaders in the psychedelic community. from the 1960's to present. It is unlikely that salvinorin A will ever become a popular substance, and many will find using the non-extracted plant material more to their liking. In contrast to using pure salvinorin A, use of the whole plant material, particularly by ingestion, produces a gentler, longer-lasting experience, that many have found easier to absorb and have derived greater benefit from. Used in this manner, Salvia divinorum is also much less overwhelming, and is not likely to present many of the dangers described below. Currently salvinorin A has been used by a relatively small group of people. Information regarding its possible effects on humans is still quite limited, and there is little known regarding the possible toxicity of this substance, particularly at higher doses. Information on the experience of about 50 users has been informally gathered and summarized here. Also presented are some insights I've obtained during approximately 30 sessions using salvinorin A. The use of salvinorin A presents some extreme dangers which are not encountered on other psychedelics. After smoking salvinorin A, some users will stand up and begin walking or moving around, running into objects that are in their path. People in this state typically move in an agitated manner and seem to be struggling with the experience. Apparently they have no recognition of their surroundings when this is taking place. This response has been noted in only a few people, about 5% of the first 50 subjects. A more common occurrence is for one who has just smoked salvinorin A to not recognize that they are heavily inebriated, and begin to walk around In these instances the user is able to perceive his or her surroundings, and moves around without bumping into objects. Several people in this situation have wanted to leave the premises where they were conducting their journey, desiring to either drive or walk to another location, and needed to be dissuaded from doing so. Often people who walk around during the journey do not recall doing so once the effects wear off. The presence of a sober person to act as sitter during the sessions has proven very important in dealing with situations such as those described above. Siebert has witnessed reactions of this type and stated: \"When the dose goes above 500 to 1000 mcg the effects can be very alarming. I have seen people get up and lunge around the room, falling over furniture, babbling incomprehensible nonsense and knocking their heads into walls. Several people have tried to wander out of the house. When the experience is over, they have no memory of any of this. In fact, they usually remember very different events.

It is also common for people to have a facial expression which is probably best described as being like that of a frightened animal.\" There is also potential psychological danger with salvinorin A. I can confirm from my own experience that it can instantly obliterate any reference to sanity, logic, or even the idea of existing, and make one feel that either one's self or the entire universe has gone entirely and permanently crazy. Occasionally people who have been given salvinorin A, even highly experienced psychedelic users, feel that a bad0 joke has been played on them by whoever gave them the substance. One person who tried salvinorin A, who is quite experienced with DMT and most other psychedelics, remarked \"It made DMT look like a water pistol, at a dose 50-100 times less.\" The intensity of a salvinorin A journey is often experienced as being an order of magnitude more potent than smoked DMT, in much the same way that DMT seems an order of magnitude more potent than a typical LSD journey. A large percentage of salvinorin A users also report that the fear factor is much greater than with DMT, which is saying a lot. I feel that no person, no matter how experienced with other psychedelics or altered states of mind, can be prepared for the intensity of a full-strength salvinorin A journey. It is common for users to be shocked, amazed and frightened, at finding themselves in a state they could not possibly conceive of being induced by any psychedelic substance. Certainly the most cautious way for one to approach this substance is to work with the whole plant material before attempting to use its active principal. Effects and Experiences Many who use salvinorin A spend the peak of their journey lying down or reclining, apparently engrossed in an internal world. At the onset of the experience there is often a complete separation of consciousness from the body and personality. similar to what occurs with Ketamine. What is experienced after this is quite variable, possibly more so than with other psychedelics. The visions seen with salvinorin A seem particularly real and convincing. Quite often people accept these visions as reality and forget they are under the influence of a psychedelic substance. Siebert has reported on a number of themes which are frequently experienced with salvinorin A. 1. Becoming objects (yellow plaid French fries, fresh paint on a drawer, a pant leg, a Ferris wheel, etc.) 2. Visions of various two-dimensional surfaces, films and membranes. 3. Revisiting places from the past, especially childhood 4. Loss of the body and/or identity. 5. Various sensations of motion, or being pulled or twisted by forces of some kind. 6. Uncontrollable hysterical laughter. 7. Overlapping realities. The perception that one is in several locations at once. There has been little written regarding first-hand experiences with Salvia divinorum or salvinorin A. Although recently reports from individuals have appeared in publications such as The Entheogen file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (9 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum Review and on internet BBS such as alt.drugs. Dale Pendell is one or the few to have taken a liking to Salvia divinorum. His book, Pharmako/Poeia, devotes an entire chapter to it and offers many poetic insights into the nature of this mysterious ally. \"Some say it is a sensual and tactile thing. Some say it's about temporality and dimensionality, that it's about time travel Somesay it's about the Root Energy Network, or that it's about becoming a plant...it's like a mirror with no frame: some don't see it at all; some do, but don't like what they see... Consciousness has to do with energy and light. It is really very simple, neither animals nor people have consciousness. It is plants that have consciousness. Animals get consciousness by eating plants.\" These poems may seem arcane to those not familiar with the Salvia divinorum experience, but are likely to be easily grasped by those who are. An experimenter who chewed Salvia divinorum leaf reports in The Entheogen Review; five minutes of uncontrollable laughter, followed by visions \"similar to those in fantasy paintings or ancient oriental palaces: the Alhambra of Grenada. A large, almost endless empty hall with beautiful arches and hundreds of columns: all in a strange, gloomy, blue-gray light with colors of deep magic and majesty.\" This person later went on to feel as if he'd become a tree, similar to an Oak. He experienced his bark as a sense organ, and remarked \"while it was happening I had no doubt that a tree feels that way.\" Subsequent to this his experience changed from entheogen to aphrodisiac. An excellent description of encounters with Salvia divinorum can be found in a tape by Bret Blosser. While on a cave hunting expedition in the Sierra Mazateca in the late 70's, Blosser quite accidentally came upon Mazatecs who use this plant, and was able to participate in several sessions with native shamans. He had the opportunity to receive instruction and learn about the plant's use over a span of several years, during which he periodically revisited the area. In his tape, Blosser discusses the uses for Salvia divinorum within the Mazatec culture, which includes; medicinally - to treat both physical and \"psychic\" illnesses, and in divining - the future, the cause or cure for an illness, and information about friends, family, and enemies. He provides insightful descriptions of his journeys, and of the preparation and guidance of his sessions. The curandero who administered Blosser's journeys works with psilocybe mushrooms more frequently than Salvia divinorum, and indicated that Salvia divinorum is \"too fast\" for most people. Prior to his extraction research with Salvia divinorum, Leander Valdes. together with Jose Diaz, had taken part in ceremonies conducted by a Mazatecan shaman during which they ingested leaves from the plant. Valdes reported the following visions in an article appearing in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology : \"I see something between a cross and a sword which is covered with gold and has many jewels... It has everything inside, lights, animals, people, plants. Everything, of many colors. like a picture. Very very vivid colors.\" Valdes characterized his experiences with Salvia divinorum as involving sensations of \"flying, floating, traveling rapidly through space, twisting and spinning. as well as a heaviness or lightness of the body.\" Later that evening Valdes' visions continued. He saw a purplish light that changed into a bee or moth like shape which became a pulsating sea anemone. The imagery expanded into a desert landscape full of moving prickly pear cactus shapes. Suddenly he found himself standing in file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (10 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum a bizarre landscape with brightly colored flowers, talking to a man wearing a shining white robe who was either shaking or holding his hand. Next to them was something that resembled the skeleton of a giant stick-model airplane made from rainbow colored inner-tubing. The \"reality\" of what he was seeing amazed him. The following experience was reported on the internet from a person who had smoked two deep bong hits of dried Salvia divinorum leaf. \"There was an edge, made of something between plastic and flesh, set about a foot in front of my face, running diagonally, upward to the right. I could touch this edge. and it had resistance when I did so. It's visual qualities were a bit less intense initially, pastel colors, some glistening. I started to pull at it, peeling it back, and it seemed then that the 'stuff' was simply \"reality\". I collapsed into a couch, closed my eyes, and unfolded the folds of this \"stuff' (or rather it unfolded me; you know how it goes, very reflexive,) a very sensual, sexual experience, moist, son and hard all at once. Or, a distinct sense of losing my \"mental faculties one by one, in very specific levels, until I could not form a thought. Space had become very peculiar, rich with crevices, stretching far down past what I could see. At this point I felt uneasy. A voice called up from one of the crevices \"Do you want to stay like this forever?\" I called out \"No!\", and the voice replied, \"Then stop doing that!\" \"That\" I took to mean the Salvia. Then I fused with a piece of furniture. A very odd experience, like I was simply the hidden other leg of the furniture, completing the gestalt, but in a very immediate bodily way.\" A recent issue of The EntheogenReviewreports on one person's journey following the smoking of two dried Salvia divinorum leaves, consumed in two large hits from a water pipe: \"I felt like and saw myself as a tree. Branches began growing out of my body, filling up the room, and I felt, and saw, my roots growing all over the floor and out beneath the door. At thispoint I could no longer remember if I had smoked anything, or if my mind had just flipped on me. My room had turned into artwork from Where the Wild Things Are, a kid's book. The room was a garden of geometric twines and leaves from my own body.\" This trip was much more intense than any previous Salvia divinorum journeys of this person, who also reported seeing entities, including, \"one who was pushing a wheelbarrow along one of my vines while smiling at me.\" Salvinorin A Journeys My own experiments with salvinorin A began in December 1994, following a highly coincidental meeting with Daniel Siebert. I first learned of salvinorin A when a copy of The Entheogen Review arrived in the mail containing Siebert's article. The following day I went to Los Angeles on business matters and to visit friends, and quite out of the blue was introduced to Siebert by someone I'd just met that day. The occasion of this unlikely meeting gave me assurance that I was meant to work with this powerful entheogen, despite Siebert's numerous reports of those who found file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (11 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum the journey harrowingly unpleasant. My journeys with salvinorin A (hereafter called salvinorin) are more varied than those of any other psychedelic I've used, and include both my best and worst psychedelic journeys. My understanding and the content of these journeys has evolved with repeated use. Certain ideas and perceptions have become clearer as I've become familiar with the territory, although the entire experience still remains largely incomprehensible, and there exists a feeling of having just stepped over the threshold into an immensely vast dimension. A description of the general framework of most of my salvinorin journeys is given below. followed by excerpts of notes from my journeys. Also presented are reports from other experimenter's journeys, which will assist in offering a more comprehensive view of the realms available through Salvia divinorum. My experiences with salvinorin can be divided into three phases or periods, the onset, trance, and return. These periods closely match the unfolding of a smoked DMT experience. Initial effects are felt within 10-20 seconds, with the peak being reached in another 30 seconds or so. I usually stay at this peak, in trance, for 3 to 10 minutes, after which there is a 10 to 20 minute decline to baseline. When used with another psychedelic the duration of a salvinorin experience can be increased several fold. Salvinorin comes on with an irresistibly powerful, spiraling force which is much stronger than that felt on any other psychedelic. During the onset I quickly fall into a trance, while my body feels permeated by \"needle-like\" anesthetic sensations. Both of these sensations are quite similar to what I feel during the onset of smoked N.N. DMT. Within seconds of this first phase, the salvinorin separates my awareness from my body, similarly to what occurs with 5-MeO- DMT or Ketamine. Salvinorin is quite distinct from Ketamine. however, in that like DMT, salvinorin exudes a strongly life-positive energy, where Ketamine does not necessarily have this predilection. Following this, I go on an internal journey while my body is lying down in trance. My experience. or recollection, of this second phase varies greatly. Sometimes I perceive the most cosmic, wondrous, and detailed of universes. while at other times I recallabsolutely nothing- In these moments of recalling nothing, I've often felt as though I only smoked the salvinorin a few moments ago and have retained consciousness the entire time. I then look at a clock and realize five or ten minutes have passed that I can not account for. I've developed a theory for this vast difference in the experiences which I'll discuss later. The amount of time I spend in the trance, and how high I am upon returning to bodily awareness, varies with each journey. It seems that I am normally pulled out of the trance by some type of sound.

In most instances, the sound which pulls me out of the trance seems like a distraction which is interfering with the experience. It is not surprising that the Mazatecs recommend that it be done in quiet. There is a tendency for awareness to lock onto individual perceptions during the return phase, and for these perceptions to appear to fill the entire universe. This has been particularly noted by Siebert and myself when music was being played during the trip. The portion of the journey immediately following the trance is often the most intense and leaves the strongest impressions. While coming out of the trance the bodily anesthetic sensations often persist, and are stronger when I come out of the trance prematurely. These feelings can be compared to the \"needles and pins\" sensation of trying to move an arm or leg which has fallen asleep. Following one journey I wrote \"I must have willed myself to move, and felt the anesthesia sensations gripping me firmly, with an almost cutting sensation. It was not exactly painful. It felt as though I was tightly gripped by millions of sharp fingernails applying minimal pressure, but if I moved I would be cut to shreds.\" This can also be experienced as a \"tearing\" sensation over the entire surface of the body. Siebert has described intensified feelings of this type as \"various sensations of motion, or being pulled or twisted by forces of some kind.\" On occasion these sensations have been very pleasant, closer to Pendell's \"like soft cat paws pressing, or like a bunch of bird tongues lapping the mind. Or like tiny fingers, the way ivy fingers reach out to climb a wall...\" The most constant internal experience in my salvinorin journeys is a drastic shift in my sense of identity and conscious perception. At the onset of the experience my identity is completely dislodged from my body and familiar self. Following this I experience myself as existing, but not as a body, human, or personality. I usually find myself in some alternate dimension, which can either closely resemble earth, or be entirely alien. Quite often the worlds visited under the influence of salvinorin do not obey the laws of physics which we are typically accustomed to. The action of the forces of gravity and momentum, the dimension of time, and the geometric construction of these worlds, can be rather bizarre. There is also an apparent reduction in boundaries, and the sensation that my \"being\" can literally enter and inhabit various objects, including inanimate ones. There have been numerous reports from people who have had quite vivid and convincing experiences of becoming objects such as a dresser drawer.

At the point I come out of tile trance, external reality begins making an imprint on my experience and accelerates the return to normal awareness. Some of my more interesting journeys are described below. #1 D.M. Turner- 1.3 mg. salvinorin For my first journey I smoked approximately 1.3 mg. of salvinorin. Immediately after smoking I felt the effects coming on, and seemed to lose consciousness after a few seconds. My next recollections are of moving about in what could have been a suburban American town in the 50's or 60's. However, I was not a person, nor did I remember ever having been a person, or taken any drug. At some point in my travels it seemed that I had stopped moving. I was perceiving everything as though I was an exterior wall of a house. I could see a yard, a street, and a village with many trees around. It could have been from my childhood. but does not bring to mind any specific memories. I soon realized that I was \"glued\" to this particular existence as the side of a house. I had become something inanimate and material, yet I was aware of life around me, and knew that I had recently been a particular human being prior to taking some powerful psychedelic. I tried to return to my previous human identity and found I was unable to do so. I felt that I was stuck for eternity as the side of this house, and an acute sense of fear and terror began to develop. In my struggle I tried to move and distinctly felt the force which was anesthetizing my body, inducing the trance, and holding me as though I was possessed. These sensations felt extremely similar to how N.N. DMT feels in these respects, only stronger. I realized my body was lying on my bed, frozen, with my jaw hanging open in a state of astonishment. I knew that whatever I'd taken was not DMT, but as I identified these effects as DMT-like, I felt that I'd taken a step towards escaping from the spell which I found myself under. As I continued to struggle back to consensus reality there were moments when it seemed the spell would never end, and there was even temptation to just rest in it. I did not feel particularly uncomfortable, only somewhat when I attempted to return to my human identity and found myself unable to do so. I felt perturbed at whoever had given me this bizarre psychedelic. Why would someone give me a substance which would leave me eternally existing as the side of a house ? This reminded me of some of the weird tales I'd heard of others who had tried this substance. I could relate to their experiences, and remembering that they had somehow returned from this realm gave me confidence in my own returning, It then seemed very important that I remember the name of the person who had given me the file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (14 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum substance, that this would somehow lead me back to sanity. After passing through various names I associate with psychedelics I came up with the correct name, and upon remembering this was able to pull myself out of bed. I immediately began walking towards the door of my room. Before the journey I had placed a note on the door as a reminder not to wander outside, and upon seeing this note, sat down to await the conclusion of the journey. Looking at the clock I saw that I'd spent 11 minutes in the trance. This experience was quite different from any of my later salvinorin journeys. It is the only time I recall becoming a two dimensional object, although similar experiences have been reported by a large percentage of users. The sensation of getting stuck or glued to a spot while traveling through hyperspace is also common, and has occurred on some of my other journeys. During this journey I also had the idea that salvinorin can only be passed on from one person to the next. I have had this idea repeatedly in my salvinorin journeys, but still do not comprehend its meaning. #2 D.M. Turner - 400 to 800 mcg. salvinorin My next three journeys were done with smaller amounts, ranging from 400 to 800 mcg. There were three related themes which repeated and developed throughout these journeys. The first is a seeming interchange that would take place between myself and whatever I was perceiving. It was as though the perceiver and the perceived switched places. I would become that which I was normally aware of The second theme is an apparent identity shift that would occur almost immediately upon smoking the salvinorin. It seemed that I was \"knocked\" out of my identity-with-the-body by an instantaneous \"percussive\" force. Perceptions of this event include the sensation of switching places between my own awareness/identity, and the awareness/identity belonging to the speck of salvinorin which I had smoked. The third theme relates to salvinorin being the substance of pure consciousness, an idea that may have sprung from my amazement at the experience produced by a tiny speck of white crystalline powder, no larger than a couple grains of salt. If there is a physical counterpart to consciousness, memory or identity in humans, and if it could be extracted from our brains, I think we would find something similar to salvinorin. In one of my journeys I began repealing the words \"becomes the substance that memory is made out of\" The internal sensation was that after salvinorin is smoked and reaches the brain, it becomes the physical matter or substance that constitutes memory, and there is a vast increase in the amount of information which is available to me. I also realized that memory is linked nearly synonymously with identity, and also very closely with consciousness. As salvinorin is coming on I gain consciousness and memory. I never actually lose consciousness, although this was my interpretation of earlier experiences.

The subject was highly experienced in the use of other psychedelics and gave the following preface to his report. \"I have smoked DMT several times, it was the ultimate disembodied, colorful and blissful realm I had known. I have taken full doses of ayahuasca where the DMT is allowed to become orally active after mixing with another plant, with its own array of psychoactive properties. I was healed by ayahuasca, and saw her face. I have used a large dose of ibogaine and was propelled through multiple universes, breaking through barrier after barrier, out of body for 4 hours, and had seen the spirit of ibogaine. I also had climbed over the shoulder of a Kuan-Yin several hundred feet tall. I have been injected with Ketamine, and was flung into a pin-ball universe of feelings having colors, and thought I had been taken to a hospital, and had been cared for a long time, tube-fed, helpless, and realized that was fine. I was looking forward to a disembodied journey into heretofore undescribedblissful realms, perhaps occupied by entities with whom I might relate or simply marvel at, all the while. I knew my drugs, and was a relative \"hard-head,\" needing more than most to break through. It was a minute amount of material, and flew into the pipe immediately upon vaporizing. There was no taste, nor any throat irritation. I remember thinking 'This is just a little bit of material, but I got it all.' I had plenty of time to lay back, and during so, laid my glasses to my left. I exhaled. and the vapor looked like my breath condensing in the cold dry air outside. I closed my eyes as I felt the onset of effects. I began to say, as I have so many times before, 'Welcome. I'm back. It's nice to be here again.' My face began spreading in a wide grin. It felt like my face could not contain the grin. I must have lost consciousness briefly. Or, there was no transition. The next thing I experienced was the feeling of my stretching grin extending outside of my face, or, beyond the borders of what I have learned to experience as my face. Was there a ripping sound? Was there a painful feeling of pins and needles, a feeling of the skin being stretched beyond what is normal? I was laying on my back, on the bed, and the right half of my body was being stretched out and somehow below me. The left half of my body was being pulled up and out. The vaulted arch ofour ceiling opened up, and a Caucasian man, with a hat like a bowler, leaned down to his fight, down to the brown leg of his slacks. He looked at me, from what seemed nearly a hundred feet, and said, 'It's time to GO NOW,' and began moving his right leg forward in a step. As his right leg swung forward, my body was merging into his pant leg, below his knee, this part of his body being as tall as I am. Rather, most of my body was being pulled into his leg. My neck, arms, and head were being dragged forward as the bed was being stretched. The visual experience was as if the world, including my body and all that I saw, had become flat, two-dimensional, and was a sheet, or a thin rubber skin, a layer. As the pulling forward and out was taking place, the colored file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (16 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum forms of what I saw were smeared, as if a running palette of colors, pulled, stretched, thinned. I pulled back, wondering if I could pull away from this tearing of the world. 'It's time to go now.' My body and the world as I knew it, was being pulled into the black universe, stars studding the space, while the outline of this man was covered with the \"being pulled\", \"smeared\" reality, of which I was an integral part. I was stunned, frightened, disbelieving. I think it hurt, but even more painful was the idea that 'this was it.' My mind began trying to sort out what had happened. I saw my wife, (who had not smoked any salvinorin) I was in our room, on the bed. I was looking at my arms, my legs, and they were being pulled like rubber cement into the surface of the world as it was disappearing, moving forward into the brown material of his pant leg. 'Is this all the world is? Part of some big man's pant leg? Its just too bizarre.' But it was happening. 'It's time to go now.' Almost with some impatience, as if I were so muddled as to not know that this was the end, the end of this reality, gone. going, being rent, stretched, pulled into another very small and insignificant part of something so big it was incomprehensible. It did not seem right. I tried saying 'I can't believe this is happening to me. This is too weird. Is this how it ends? A pant leg, being ripped out and forward. I had no warning, this is not what I expected.' I was completely convinced that this was taking place. But the right half of my mouth was not there to properly form the words. My wife later said that I was speaking gibberish, but there was a sense of wondered revelation to my tone. She said I looked relatively normal when I opened my eyes, no enlarged dilated pupils. But she knew, when she heard me, that I was far gone. \"I looked at my wife. She, too, was being pulled up and out, the right half of her body streaming into the movement forward. I thought it was happening to her, but she was more concerned about how I was reacting than for her own demise. I thought of the person who had given me the substance, that this was something he knew, and that my taking this substance was the trigger for the end of the universe, space, time, all history, all people and things, and feelings and thoughts, all flattened and streaming forward, into a smeared palette of colors. My wife later told me I was staring in disbelief around me and at my body and saying 'It's smeared, it's smearing. It's the universe. We are moving into the universe, it's ending.' I looked carefully at my left forearm and hand. I saw the transition between my flesh, and tiny bubbles of color, streaming upward and outward into the pulling canvas of matter. My legs were doing the same thing, as was the entire room. 'It's time to go now!' The sense continued, hammering. I felt, but did not think, 'No, I'm not ready. There is so much undone, unfelt, unsaid.' I felt I should have been better warned or prepared. I thought of the Buddha, my patron saint, and the teachings he promulgated. There was nothing in them that was even close to the enormity of what I was experiencing. Did he know about this? Was he and all his teaching, the life of thousands of years of followers of his and other religions ending as a thin two-dimensional sheet? It seemed so trivial compared to how it was ending. I wondered about the plant from which this material was derived. Is this the reason for the plant's existence To mediate the ending of the universe? file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (17 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum \"To one of my requests for reassurance my wife said it's happening. relax, lay back in bed.' I'd been twisting and turning, trying to move away from the dissolving edge. I said to my wife 'If this is how it ends, I ought to just relax. I will miss you, I'm glad we met. Please lay by my side so we can go out together.' She lay down next to me and I kissed her forehead. She then lay across my chest. enveloping me with her body. I felt her love, and felt we were ending together. I felt us both merging with the edges of the end, and felt my body merging more fully with the sheet of reality that we were becoming. \"Some moments later I opened my eyes again. and felt the ripping and pulling diminishing. I looked up and saw that the ceiling was beginning to congeal around a well- demarcated line. I looked at my left hand and saw there was an irregular line, curving in the same pattern as that of the ceiling. My hand was slowly filling in with substance again. I used all my strength to roll onto my left side. away from the force that had been sucking and stretching everything forward. I sat up next to it, and could see the outline of the force in the air. I said to my wife 'It's less, its over. I need to get out of here.' I was afraid it would start up again and felt if I was not in the room 1 could escape it. I said 'I'm down, I'm not tripping anymore, I'm fine. I just need to get out of here fast.' I went to the door leading outside. My truck was outside. a vehicle I'd had for 12 years. I wanted to look at it to verify its solidity and see how it was faring. My wife later said I was crouched and moving extremely rapidly. and appeared psychotic. The deadbolt was locked, and for a second I thought, its because there's no way to escape the ending. I then remembered my wife had locked the deadbolt and went to the dresser where the keys are usually kept. but was unable to find them. On my way to the other door my wife managed to get me back in the bed. \"The experience continued to subside. The colors were no longer coming off my body. I sat on the bed staring at my extremities, shaken, disturbed, completely baffled, upset, alarmed. exhausted, sad, frightened, stunned. The room now looked fine, I was no longer \"tripping,\" but still altered. I kept saying to my wife. 'I'm fine, now, but I just had an unbelievable experience. I do not know what to say.\" This report provides an excellent description of how frighteningly shocking and unpredictable a salvinorin journey can be. It also shows another variation of the bizarre physical dimensions encountered on this substance, and hints at some of the possible dangers that can arise through its use. The next report describes a quite different journey with highly positive results. #4 D.M. Turner - 350 mcg. Salvinorin with 360 mcg. LSD file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (18 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum My fifth journey, which took place five days after my first, was also the first time I combined Salvinorin with LSD. I started with 360 mcg. of quad-sep (very pure) LSD. About 4 hours later I smoked 350 mcg. of Salvinorin which was greatly potentiated. Prior to smoking the Salvinorin, I noticed that the entire LSD trip felt different than the many other trips I'd had using this same batch. It seemed that everything had a \"Salvinorin edge\" to it, which was probably a result of my experiments in the preceding days. I also noticed an unusually heavy adrenaline flow which increased as I was approaching the time to smoke the Salvinorin. Conversely, my mind seemed quite calm, as I looked forward to trying this combination primarily with curiosity, secondly with enthusiasm, and felt only a slight amount of apprehension. I took a shower and meditated for a while to calm down prior to smoking the Salvinorin. The initial effects felt similar to my other Salvinorin experiments in that I found myself relaxing in a state of immensely expanded awareness. On this occasion, however, my awareness was filled with millions of universes, bordering on the brink of infinity as I frequently experience with Ketamine. While enjoying this immersion in consciousness, I realized I was not existing in the time-bound physical universe which I normally call reality. My \"Being\" was separating from physical space-time, as though they were two separate wheels rotating in opposite directions. It was as though I'd died and become disembodied consciousness, and was no longer subject to the gravitational laws of the earth spinning about its axis, and revolving around the sun, etc I also was no longer anchored to the gravity of the ego, and there was nothing to prevent my drifting off in whatever directions the cosmic forces propelled me. A minute later I became aware of sensations in my body, and felt myself being pulled out of this expanded universe into my previous existence. The sensation felt as though I had stepped outside of time for just a second, was enjoying a tranquil moment of eternity, and then felt myself being yanked back by a strange force that prevents things from moving between multiple universes. I had the thought that what I'd experienced was similar to someone who'd had a near-death experience. It seemed that I had died for a short period; that consciousness or identity began to \"disperse,\" and then I was suddenly yanked back from the \"gates of heaven\" by some attachment to my body. Is Salvinorin related to a substance produced in the brain of people who undergo near-death experiences? It felt that when I smoked the Salvinorin I had remembered who I was. I remembered I was consciousness not a body, and as consciousness I had access to unlimited realms. Another perception of what took place is that the \"I\" that smoked the Salvinorin dissolved into infinity, and a different but similar entity jumped out of infinity into the body that was file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (19 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum lying on the bed. This seemed to be an explanation for my body's fear. My body new it was going to be losing the \"spirit\" which had been inhabiting it, and was going to have a new spirit come inside. After returning to bodily awareness, I jotted down some notes and lay back to enjoy the remainder of the Salvinorin journey. Soon I saw a rounded, wave-like shape moving in front of me, located horizontally across the room. It was very soft in contrast to the rest of the environment. It was clear and appeared to be made only of air, hut had a blurring, refocusing, lens-like effect on whatever was seen through it. I closed my eyes and began to see the bright white light which often accompanies a near death experience during psychedelic journeys. This light never reached the intensity of which I know it is capable, and remained shrouded in a veil of softly glowing green light. Soon this manifested into a beautiful, sensuous, flowing image. It appeared to be a luxuriant green vine, serpent, plant, Goddess, incorporating all of these forms into a whole that was alive and constantly moving. I distinctly recall seeing long. grouped, twisting vines. a moderate amount of leaves that! resembled maple leaves in shape, the twisting body of a serpent, and the face and top half of a female body. All of these images appeared several times in different branches of this \"entity,\" and were intricately interwoven and flowing in and out of each other. All the images were green in color with the exception of the female bodies, which were a lighter. green-tinted white. I felt this entity to be the spirit of the Salvia divinorum plant who was inviting me into her world. I also had the impression that I could best communicate with her by ingesting her leaves, rather than using the ultra-potent extracted active principal, and if I were to seek her in a natural plant-filled environment. This was my first encounter with what I'll call the \"Salvia entity.\" I have now encountered this entity on about twenty occasions, several of them occurring when I had not consumed any form of Salvia divinorum; Certain visions and feelings have been common in these encounters. The Salvia entity is almost always accompanied by a luxuriant green radiance, frequently seen as a large twisting matrix of fleshy green vines, which on occasion appear to spread throughout the entire universe. The feeling and energy that accompanies this entity is loving, benevolent, healing, and comforting comforting. One person described it as \"being rocked in the arms of Mother Nature.\" Salvia divinorum has the most distinctly feminine energy of any Entheogen I have used. It also has a quality of pristine clarity and pureness, which may have something to do with the Mazatecs associating it with the Virgin. Experiences of this nature have been reported by several users of Salvia divinorum. #5 D.M. Turner - 650 mcg. Salvinorin with 500 mcg. LSD file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (20 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum Several days later I repeated this experience, using 500 mcg. of LSD, and smoking 650 mcg. of Salvinorin about 1 1/2 hours into the trip. Immediately after smoking the Salvinorin, familiar sensations began coming over me, however, these seemed gentler than usual. Within seconds the visuals turned into a continuation of the green plant/serpent/goddess I had seen during my recent journey. This first appeared as a large, twisted green vine that was growing, branching,twirling and intertwining itself in every which direction. The energy of this \"plant\" seemed very pleasant. I paid closer attention to it and saw that the vine strands were actually made of a continuous line of serpents that were biting each other's tails. Then, upon further examination, I saw the vine composed of fish biting each other's tails. As I noticed this it seemed that I was let into a secret, and into a new dimension of experience. These fish were seen doing loops, circles, and cascading all about in electric-psychedelic patterns. Many of the fish looked dolphin or porpoise-like. The feeling this vision evoked was both magical and funny. Thousands of these tiny fish were lightly biting on the entire surface of my body, producing the \"needle- like anesthetic sensation\" I've come to expect with Salvinorin. The sensation here was much gentler than usual and rather pleasant. Since I found the experience both cosmically meaningful and funny I said out loud \"Green Electric Fish,\" and soon afterwards started laughing. I had a tape recorder running during this session, and later discovered I had spoken these words 20 seconds after smoking the Salvinorin. One thing I noticed was that green, electric, and fish are three things which a human will immediately reject as being not-self or repulsive. When I saw the plants turn to fish I realized there was a close synergy between them. Both plants and fish have lived on this planet many times longer than humans. In living in balance with and very connected to the earth, they have developed an elaborate consciousness network, which I felt I had been let in on. These green-electric-fish, which represent what humans are not, were inviting me into their world, into their consciousness, and seemingly wanted to play. Soon I found myself in an underwater world. It was as though I had shape-shifted and was now perceiving through the eyes of some creature that lived in the sea. I saw a continual view looking through water. upward toward the light. The scenes that I was watching seemed extremely realistic. and changed at about the rate that a fish swims. At almost all times there was a curving, lens-like effect that looking through water creates. And I now think back on the \"lens-like wave\" I saw in my recent experience. There were visions looking up through seaweed as it gently moved in the ocean swells while light filtered down, intricate patterns created in the water by other fish swimming above me, and the magical intricacies of light filtering through water. The light always came from above. With this journey I began noticing that the content of the Salvinorin experience is significantly altered if taken following the ingestion of another psychedelic. This theory has been repeatedly confirmed by my subsequent Salvinorin journeys, taken both with and without other file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (21 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum substances. Normally when I smoke Salvinorin there is a tendency to almost immediately begin looking for a reference point, to start coming back. In my baseline state of mind I tend to have a firm definition of \"reality.\" While Salvinorin temporarily breaks my grasp on reality, some mechanism in me begins attempting to reestablish a stable vantage point shortly after. I feel this is an impediment to having useful or enjoyable journeys on Salvinorin, and lately I have conducted most of my Salvinorin journeys while tripping. In the instances when I smoke Salvinorin while already high on LSD, I have been able to effortlessly float into the journey, and into the \"Salvinorin realm\" for a long period of time. This has provided much more meaningful and eventful experiences. I think this difference is due to LSD's property of diminishing the tendency to continually define one's ego boundaries. In later experiences I discovered that this combination is only useful if Salvinorin is used in the early stages of an LSD journey, while the ego is in a state of releasing its grasp. When I've smoked Salvinorin during the return stage of LSD journeys, when the ego is being reformulated, I've had some of the most negative experiences of my life, one of which is discussed below. The journey described above was also the first in which I shape-shifted and traveled underwater, a theme which has now repeated several times with different variations. #6 D.M. Turner - Salvinorin with LSD On one occasion when I smoked Salvinorin during an LSD journey, while coming out of the trance I found my awareness fixating on the sound of a loud vehicle that was driving by. As I found this rather unpleasant I put on some music, which soon took on immense proportions in relation to all other perceptions. The piece being played was Hendrix's \"1983\", a song I've listened to numerous times while tripping. On this occasion, however, I found myself even more captivated by the music than usual, and very tuned into what was occurring each moment. The most unique and surprising aspect of this experience happened when the music was leading me from the land to the sea. As this occurred, I experienced very distinct olfactory hallucinations that were completely fitting with the musical scenario. This is the only time I can remember having this sensation. #7 D.M. Turner - 850 mcg. Salvinorin with 40 mg. 2C-B The next psychedelic I tried Salvinorin with was 2C-B. While on 2C-B. but prior to commencing this experiment, I asked the Salvia entity whether it was appropriate to use her at this time. Almost immediately after I'd begun meditating on this question she appeared in all her radiant splendor, took me for a ride through the Salvinorin realms, and left me with a very definite \"yes\" as her answer. Earlier I had consulted her while high on ecstasy and was file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (22 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum advised that it was not an appropriate time to smoke Salvinorin. I smoked 850 mcg. of Salvinorin and was immediately transported into a dimension where I shared the consciousness of the Salvia entity. My awareness was spread throughout the labyrinthine maze of her roots, stems, and leaves, in connection with many other plant forms. I found myself on the brink of infinity, a sensation I have felt several times now on Salvinorin but had previously only felt on Ketamine at this level of intensity. I had the perception that when I smoke Salvinorin, the Salvia entity and myself actually trade/share consciousness for a period of time. While I'm being taken for a fantastic ride by the Salvinorin. the Salvia entity is simultaneously taking a ride while experiencing through a human reference. I had the feeling that Salvia enjoys being smoked when the smoker's mind is open to take her on pleasant psychedelic journeys and to experience the unique philosophical perspectives which are often attained while tripping. Soon I found myself in a realm that was filled with fairie and elfin creatures. I enjoyed playing with these critters which had a highly distinctive visual appearance. These elves were quite different from those I've frequently encountered while on DMT. They were composed of numerous different elements, were quite abstract, and each was uniquely intricate. The DMT elves tend to form intricate patterns if viewed as a group, being composed of a smaller amount of body-part shapes which are usually replicated in each elf The Salvinorin elves were dressed differently than the DMT elves and acted more goofy and playful They were composed of many soft hues of color, where the DMT elves tend towards contrasty radiant elements. There was one critter that looked like a dressed hamster. I could see that his body was sewn from rough burlap cloth. He was bursting at the warns in a few spots, and I could see the loose thread and a bit of stuffing starting to come out. This seemed not to bother him however, as he 'was quite happy and animated. The Salvinorin elves' energy was also different. They seemed just as playful and friendly as in a child's dream, without the enchanting/mischievous trickery of the DMT elves. As I was watching the elves they began to mutate, and I went through an experience which in the practice of Celtic magick is known as dark faerie. Initially the elves turned into bat/rodent-like creatures. I recall looking at the unsightly detail of their faces and \"ears,\" and soon was seeing nothing but bat mouths, teeth and throats, as though I was being eaten by bats. This experience was not frightening in any way, as I was identifying as witnessing consciousness, but it certainly wasn't what I'd call a beatific psychedelic experience either. Next I saw myself looking into the talons, beak and throat of an owl, and then the talons, beak and throat of a hawk.

The flying animals that I saw were successively habituated first in caves below the ground, then moving higher into the sky. During this transition I also went from night to day. Whatever I was must have been quite tasty to all] of these flying creatures. Something I've now noticed on many Salvinorin journeys is that the transition from plant to human consciousness, which inevitably occurs as I return from each journey, is seen as a descent from a higher to a lower level of awareness and being. Upon returning from this Salvinorin journey I felt a very strong connection with the Salvia plant. I desired to have a similarly strong connection with N.N. DMT and decided to smoke some at that time. I had one of the most cosmic DMT experiences of my life. In this vividly recalled journey I passed through several clearly defined dimensional boundaries into what was, for me, previously unexplored territory. #8 D.M. Turner - 30 mg. N.N. DMT (subsequent to smoking Salvinorin) I loaded my pipe and smoked 30 mg. in three tokes. I entered DMT space and was greeted with the usual pantheon of critters and objects. Recollection of my recent Salvinorin journey and desire to connect in the same way with DMT was basically forgotten as I watched the elves moving about. These elves and other creatures didn't seem to be doing anything of particular interest or meaning, and looking past them I saw some doors from behind which came occasional flashes of bright, colored light. A friend of mine had recently remarked that he thought the DMT elves were primarily there to distract one from entering the deeper aspects of DMT experiences, and that he'd been successful in moving beyond them by willing the elves to let him pass. This was in my mind as I said to the elves \"Let Me Through. Let Me Through....\" I had to repeat this several times with lots of force, even saying it out loud. Eventually the elves reluctantly let me through, and as I passed though a doorway I was admitted to a vast dimensional space. At this point I seemed to be flying. I was disembodied consciousness, and I scanned this new space to hone in on any beings that might be present. Soon I came across some angel/guardian type beings. I recall there were about seven of them. They looked like blobs of light. somewhat gray in color and sort of egg-shaped. They appeared solid from a distance, but on closer examination I saw that their bodies were made of closely packed fibers. These were file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (24 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum connected at the center but apparently could open at any point on the outside of their bodies. They seemed to be part computer. part robot, part flesh/brain matter. But all of these elements were blended into one living whole. When I came into their territory these beings briefly glanced over at me, as if saying \"what's all this commotion,\" then went back to their tasks, seemingly ignoring me. It seemed that they were busy watching over everything that happens in our space-time dimension, and occasionally making minor adjustments to keep everything in line. Anyway, my thrust of will which had propelled me past the elves and through the door into the guardian's space, continued propelling me out through the back of the guardian's realm and into another time space dimension. When I first entered this new time-space dimension I encountered its guardian beings. These beings looked similar to, but slightly different than, the guardians from our dimension. There were about 50 to 60 of them, and they reacted very differently to my appearance. These beings were quite surprised to see me, primarily because I had not come from the dimension that they were guarding, but had come in from the back side of hyperspace. They all huddled together as if in conference, trying to determine if it was OK to let me pass. Eventually they decided, with hesitation, that I could continue on, and I swooped down into a foreign planetary system. I came to a planet that was highly evolved, both scientifically and technically. The place I entered into was some type of research center, and my attention was focused on some large metallic pods that were being moved in and out of racks by elaborate robotic arms. Bach of these pods was something like an isolation chamber. They were shaped like large coffins about eight feet long, although with rounded edges. The oval cross sections were about three feet wide. The beings who used these pods looked exactly like humans. The pods were filled with a foam- type material which was connected to the sides of the pod. and also contacted the entire skin surface area of the person inside the pod. The foam was serrated, and I understood that it served as a conductor of food, water, heat, medicines, etc. between the pods' technical systems and the person resting in it. These pods were also cold chambers. They were not for cryogenically freezing a person, but put them into some type of suspended animation. It was soon impressed on me that the whole purpose of these pods and this research center, was that this was the method the people here used to increase the level of DMT in the brains of the pod sleepers. One fortunate enough to be a research subject would go into a pod for weeks or months at a time. The DMT levels in their brain would be significantly increased, and they would spend their time having the most fascinating dreams! This research that was taking place was considered the most serious aspect of this society's evolution. I entered into the mind of a person inside a pod. It was a woman who file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (25 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum appeared to be about 25 years old. As I went into her mind and became aware of all I've described above, she simultaneously became aware of much of my world. This was the first time her society had ever had contact with an earthling. And it was quite a shock and discovery for her to find out that there were other people who didn't need to go through the elaborate technological process of increasing DMT levels through suspended animation, but simply smoked the stuff and could collect it from any of several plants. It must have been a bit embarrassing for her. Initially I thought that she must have asked her guardians to let her pass into another dimension as I had done. Although on further thought, it seemed that I had come to her dimension on my own power, and was quite possibly invading her space. She may have been a bit taken back by this, as well. Almost instantly she wanted to leave her pod to announce her discovery to the rest of the research team. #9 D.M. Turner - 650 mcg. Salvinorin with 30 mg. N.N. DMT After returning from this DMT journey I got the idea of smoking Salvinorin and DMT simultaneously. At the time I did not think to consult with either the Salvia entity or the DMT entity, and proceeded with my planned experiment. I smoked 30 mg. of DMT in three tokes, followed immediately by 650 mcg. of Salvinorin that I had preloaded in a separate pipe. The effects were felt almost immediately. The first thing I noticed was a grid of crosshatch patterns. I had perceived something similar when using 2C-B with mushrooms, which I believed to be the result of using two psychedelics that were not compatible with each other. However, in this case the patterns were defined to a much sharper degree, and it seemed apparent that these two substances affect consciousness in differing ways that are not synchronistic when used together. Both the Salvia and DMT entities seemed to have been taken entirely off guard and had not been expecting this confrontation. These entities seemingly paid no attention to me as their attention was entirely fixed on each other. It soon became apparent that the two were going to battle, vying to determine who would have control of my consciousness. It was like a scene of two Gods battling in a mythological tale. At first it seemed that DMT, with its ability to manifest in spectacular forms displaying its might, power, and ferociousness, would tower up above the Salvia entity and overpower it. But the Salvia entity moves very fast, is extremely maneuverable, and has a silent, stealthy force that will not be denied. Soon the Salvia entity was running circles around, and had interpenetrated the DMT. It was not a pretty scene to watch, but Salvia took the upper hand. file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (26 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum The visions I was seeing while watching this battle were severely distorted. smushed, reversed, and turned sideways. All the favorite creatures of DMT Elf land were put together with the wrong body pans, or body parts in the wrong places. Their normally gaudy outfits had been turned into white and brown plaid shins, and they were wearing brown leather shoes and carrying brown briefcases, Millions of these miserable little creatures were frantically running around as door-to- door salesmen. They were moving perpendicular to everything else on she surface of their planet, as though they were obeying a gravitational force that was at a 90 degree angle from everything in their surroundings. By the end it seemed that DMT was unhappy and had lost face by being unseated, possibly for the first time. The Salvia entity seemed reasonably comfortable in her ability to deal with DMT. Although she seemed glad that the battle was over, and still very surprised that I had introduced to her something that actually wanted to overpower her, and had made a significant attempt. Fortunately, neither of these entities seemed extremely upset with me the next time I confronted them. I've recently had some experiences where these two seemed to be working together to make changes in my psyche (although I had used them on separate occasions.) However, I will probably never combine these entheogens again, unless I get a clear message from both of them that this is desired. I also have not used Salvinorin with mushrooms since psilocybin is very closely related to DMT. #10 D.M. Turner - 750 mcg. Salvinorin with 600 mcg. LSD My next significant journey involved smoking 750 mcg. of Salvinorin about 6 hours after taking 600 mcg. of LSD. The LSD was from a new batch which was a bit different than what I'd been using, and some unusual feelings developed during the trip. The most pronounced of these was a highly surreal feeling which occurred on numerous occasions. Just prior to smoking the Salvinorin I walked out to my back yard, as I had wanted to establish some type of contact with nature and plant life before the experience. Immediately upon stepping outside the atmosphere was filled with a magical energy. The wind chimes, which had been silent until then, began chiming, even though there was no wind. The plants around the yard were radiating an electrical glow and the air had a sparkling, shimmering quality. I walked amongst the plants and perceived an aura in each one, which was quite distinct from that of any other plant. Prior to this I'd only had vague sensations of plant's auras when using psychedelics. Now the auras seemed to be reaching out towards me, as though desiring to have contact of this type after several years of my not file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (27 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum perceiving them on this level. The plants whose auras seemed the most intense or empathic often were plants that I do not normally pay much attention to. Eventually I went inside and smoked the Salvinorin. It came on very strong and I felt as though the universe I inhabited was being severely tweaked. All of a sudden there was a sensation that the universe began rotating on an axis that was perpendicular to its normal planes of rotation. Normally the earth spins around its own axis, while also moving around the axis of the sun, while our whole solar system spins around some other point in the galaxy, etc. The motion of all these rotations tends to be along a relatively flat disc. as can be seen inphotographs of galaxies. The motion which I felt appeared to be a shift where everything began rotating at a perpendicular angle to the galactic disc. I was aware that I was high on Salvinorin at the time this occurred. However, I felt that this event was something which had nothing to do with my inebriated state, but was a massive change being felt all across our planet at the time. There was also the sensation that time had stopped, that everything had stopped revolving around its axis and had slowly begun to revolve in the opposite direction. I then had a sensation where I could see around the edge of \"existence,\" and saw an opposite. or negative image, of everything in this sphere of existence. As this occurred I began repeating some words. I'm not positive of exactly what I said, but it was something on the order of \"We are the reverse side of your existence.\" As this happened the whole concept of my existence as a particular person seemed quite ludicrous and artificial. With this perception it seemed as though the universe had collapsed and turned inside out. And the concept that I had an identity as a particular human being, or even that at' \"I\" existed, was entirely pulled out from beneath my feet. The thought that came to mind immediately after this occurred was that this was psychedelia in its truest form, where the sense of identity dissolves and \"mind-manifesting\" occurs at every level. Next I found myself in what I can only describe as a black hole of identity. According to scientific literature, a black hole is created when a giant star collapses to become an object smaller than a single atom. The black hole is of such incredible mass, density and gravity that even light cannot escape from it, What I experienced was like a type of gravity which held my being so strongly that it could not escape to form an identity. I felt as though I were within a dimensionless. spherical, enclosed universe, perhaps something similar to Einstein's perception of curved space-time. Within this closed universe ii seemed that all forces, such as gravity and centrifugal force, were somehow reversed and opposed to how they normally function. A million impossibilities seemed to exist. It felt as though events in my life during the last few hours, days, weeks, and months had been building up to this experience. In the state in which I found myself it seemed that everything was real, all possibilities, opposites, absurdities and fictions existed quite comfortably here. And it seemed that time was on a revolving or repeating trajectory. Within the closed sphere, millions of file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (28 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum concentric gears were spinning around and through each other in every which direction. If the ego began to establish an identity for even a fraction of a second it would seem to get chopped in half, being severed as though placed between two opposingly spinning gears. Each time this occurred there was a moment of anguish and pain. And just moments later, as the wheel of time revolved around again, there would follow a sense of relief that I was not stuck with the identity I had just tried to form. One of the most profound perceptions that I had was of seeing my life from millions of different angles. It seemed that the life I had led was like a drawing etched into the multi-dimensional fabric of space-time, every action I've taken and thought I have had forming a turn or a branch in this complex carving. What I experienced while in this state was millions of other possible lives of my person. For every decision I've made in life, a duplicate of myself is formed in nonexistence that chose the opposite of the decision I made. While in this bizarre state of mind, or non-existence, I was simultaneously experiencing these millions of alternate persona, and with vivid recollection of all that had transpired in their oppositely directed lives. And through these million persona I was staring into the face of the single line of existence I had chosen to pursue in life. While on other psychedelics I've perceived what has felt like everything that has happened in my current life, but I had never before experienced all the alternate lives I could have chosen to lead. It occurred to me sometime around this point that I must be dead. It seemed an impossibility that I could undergo what I was now experiencing and still have a connection to a mortal body. Upon perceiving this there was a slight bit of disappointment, a feeling that I'd left the plane of living before I was planning to, and regret that I'd left many things uncompleted in life. I remember saying to myself \"Oh shit, I really did it this time. I thought I could get away with skirting the edge of immortality and keep coming back to my body, but this time I went a little too far.\" As time continued, however, I noticed the force within the black hole starting to subside. I would occasionally have longer periods of identity, including moments that seemed within my previous perceptual framework. As this was occurring I still did not know whether I would ever exist in my familiar body, but I began developing hope that I would. There was also a feeling that I had to \"ride out\" the experience I was going through, and should not attempt to grasp a familiar identity right away. By the time I knew I would be returning to my body again, and was able to open my eyes and look at the clock, approximately two hours had passed since I'd smoked the Salvinorin. At this point I was about 80% back to normal. It took another hour until I was completely back and ready to get up off the bed. Both the intensity and duration of this experience were quite different than any of my previous Salvinorin journeys, which have file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (29 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum all been between 20 and 40 minutes. Subsequent experiments smoking Salvinorin when well into an LSD journey have produced similarly discomforting results. #11 B. Schuldes - 2 \"bong hits\" Salvia leaf with 350-450 mcg. LSD The Entheogen Review contains a report of a Salvia-LSD trip which has some parallels to my own experience with this combination. This journey was induced by smoking a small amount of dried Salvia divinorum leaf, which typically would yield only minimal effects when not potentiated by LSD. \"Upon reading that a large initial intake is critical to the level of the experience, I smoked Salvia divinorum in a bong. One inhalation led to minimal effects when used alone. Desirous of the full spectrum, I tried smoking it while in the midst of my usual 35~450 mcg. of LSD. I inhaled deeply and then again. Sometime after the second inhalation I completely lost awareness of anything. After several seconds (or minutes, I really don't know) awareness returned, though only remotely. There was pain in my lungs and I began deep breathing. I started to panic and thought I'd burned my lungs somehow. While still desperately puffing in and out, my perception imploded. Our vision resolves images from each eye into one image: in this case, my perception became impossibly skewed: my consciousness was imploding! Totally confused, I felt that I was being electrocuted and I began spinning and moving around to tree myself from the \"current.\" My face felt like it was also imploding and at one point it seemed like I could see its other side; my eyes were now facing each other! I was convinced that death was imminent. My girlfriend assured me that I appeared normal, which comforted me greatly. At this point I had no memory of having smoked the Salvia -- it took ten minutes before I remembered. I satin total confusion, still convinced that death was certain. Slowly, the familiar LSD awareness returned, though for a long time my central vision bulged as in Escher's \"Balcony\" and I felt that my mind had malfunctioned terribly. In retrospect, the phenomenon was much like a profound and relentless dizziness. I've smoked just Salvia twice since this experience and found that I need inhale only a minimal quantity (two small puffs) to stimulate a mild, short-acting recurrence of the phenomenon.\" # 12 Daniel Siebert - June 6, 1993 2.6 mg. unidentified impure crystalline fraction of Salvia divinorum (Later the material was analyzed and shown to be 70-80% Salvinorin A.) file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (30 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum The experience described below is the first human use of Salvinorin A. At the time of this experiment, Siebert had been trying various extracts and preparations of Salvia divinorum, attempting to find a means of obtaining a fuller psychedelic experience than he had reached through chewing or smoking the leaves. Salvinorin A - The Breakthrough \"I had set out to prepare a fairly crude but significantly concentrated extract of Salvia divinorum. During the extraction procedure I managed to isolate a fairly pure crystalline fraction. At the time, I thought this fraction was probably some inactive component of the plant. I was getting ready to throw it in the trash, when it suddenly occurred to me that perhaps I should test a little; just on the remote chance that the material might actually be active. \"Hope springs eternal\" I thought. Fortunately I decided to play it safe, and so I tested what I thought would be a fairly small dose. What follows is a record of the scattered bits and pieces of my memory of that event. \"I placed 2.6 mg. of the material to be tested on a small piece of aluminum foil. I held a small torch under it, and as soon as the substance vaporized, I inhaled the fumes through a piece of glass tubing. I waited for awhile and decided that nothing was going to happen. The last words to pass through my head went something like \"Just as I thought. This stuff is inactive. I'll go toss it in the trash.\" Then quite suddenly I found myself in a confused, fast moving state of consciousness with absolutely no idea where my body or for that matter my universe had gone. I have little memory of this initial period of the experience, but r do know that a lot was happening and that it seemed quite literally like an eternity, when in fact it must only have lasted a few minutes.” \"I knew something had gone wrong and I wanted desperately to get back to the ‘real’ world. I searched my memory trying to remember the living room I was sitting in just moments before. I tried to remember what my body felt like. Anything, just something to reconnect me with the ‘normal’ world. But the more I looked for some little thread or ‘normality’ to get a hold of, the more it showed me something else. At some point I realized that what I was trying to get back to did not exist. It was just an ephemeral dream. I suddenly realized that I had no actual memory of ever having lived in any other state of consciousness but the disembodied condition I was now in. So I decided to stop panicking arid just relax. After all there was no place to get back to.

The effects of the substance were wearing off. All of the confusion dissolved, and I returned to the physical world. I looked around me and the room came into sharp focus. I was glad to be back. But then I saw that something was wrong! This was not my living room. It was the living room of my deceased maternal grandparents. And it was furnished as it was when I was a child, not as it was later in their life. The most extraordinary thing about this was that this was the real world, not a memory or a vision, I was really there, and it was all just as solid as the room I'm sitting in now. I had the sudden realization that although I had managed to pull my self back into my body - I had somehow ended up back in the wrong spot in the time line of my physical existence. I was convinced that I might be stuck in this situation and would have to continue my life from this point in my past. As I panicked and desperately tried to remember where it was that I was supposed to be, I lost awareness of the physical world again, and found myself without a body; lost. Then it happened again. I found myself regaining consciousness in the real world. And again as I saw everything clearly, I realized that this was not my home, It was a friend of mine's. Then again I panicked and lost consciousness. This cycle repeated at least 7 or 8 times. Always I would find myself in a familiar room. Some of these places were from my childhood and some were from my more recent past. In this state all the points of time in my personal history coexisted. One did not precede the next. Apparently, had I so willed it, I could return to any point in my life and really be there, because it was actually happening right now.” \"Then at some point I did indeed find myself back in my home, I was standing in the dining room. I wanted to reassure myself that everything was as it should be, so I turned around to see the rest of the room behind me. I kept turning around but there was no ‘behind’ me. There was only ‘in front’ of me. I reached around for the back pockets of my jeans and couldn't seem to find them. \"A little later the physical world all started to work properly again.

This person smoked a single hit of dried Salvia divinorum leaf through a water pipe. He estimates the amount of material at under 1.2 gram, and it was not potentiated by any other substance. Upon inhaling and holding a large hit: \"After about 15 seconds I realized I could hold my breath as long as I wanted. My cells seemed to still be respirating somehow, and I thought that breathing is really a luxury, something we do more out of habit than anything else. This alarmed me, and I exhaled. While I exhaled, I received a flood of colorful visions, swirling patterns of light against a dark, outer space-like background. This swirl formed into a tunnel, which led from somewhere in front of me (maybe 20 yards in front of my center of vision) to \"behind\" my eyes. By thinking about it, I could move my perspective a little bit. My peripheral vision and imagination was filled with what seemed like two beings. One was old and male, one was young and female. They were encouraging me to look straight through the tube, aligning my center of vision with it. Well. this tube thing was very soft and flexible. and any attempt to look through the end caused it to wrinkle somewhere in the middle, ruining my straight view through it. After some practice, I was able to get a brief glimpse into a fractal dimension of untold complexity. Around the \"mouth\" of this tube were several other tubes, each with the same view inside. I was presented with the fact that these tubes were the building blocks of cellular matter, and the word \"nucleotide\" was loud in my head. I don't even know what it really means, but the voice was telling me it was what I was looking at. They were saying \"a little to the right, come on, don't wait until you're dead to see this, it's great !\" The whole thing, while fascinating, had a bit of a nausea-like flavor due to a physical/mental \"turbulence\", like my mind was doing somersaults.\" \"After giving up my effort to hold the tube straight enough to see through, I remembered that I existed, and realized I was coming down, The mouth of the tube drew away from me, or I fell away from it was like coming out of a black hole, and then being able to observe the mouth suddenly...This tube can be visualized somewhat by imagining a funnel.

Turner - Salvia divinorum leaf, smoked outdoors While I was experimenting with Salvinorin I occasionally tried smoking Salvia divinorum leaf. On my first few attempts I felt little more than a buzz from the dried leaf. The first time I obtained a significant experience with the leaf occurred when I smoked some in the desert at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. Two sequential pipe hits produced a gentle but definite \"Salvinorin journey,\" during which I felt a connection with the Salvia entity: Since this time I've found that I can almost always obtain a gentle Salvinorin journey by smoking the leaf. However, when I've smoked the dried leaf in the early stages of LSD journeys I've had very powerful experiences, some that have lasted up to three hours. When I was at Organ Pipe Cactus N.M. I had been planning to smoke Salvinorin the following day while I was tripping on mescaline. However, the following day's journey entailed much extreme physical discomfort, as the temperature reached 120 and was over 100 throughout the day. Something I've now noticed on a few mescaline trips is that I seem to become a sensitive receptor for solar energy. It's as though I absorb and concentrate the sun's energy just as a cactus does, turning it into a higher level of energy within my body. This has felt exhilaratingly welcome when the sun peaked through the clouds on a snowy day in the high mountains of New Mexico. However, on a hot summer day in the middle of the desert it is simply too much. This sensitivity to heat and sunlight may be the cause for the saying that \"one will go mad if they consume Peyote during the daytime.\" Because of the intense heat I did not smoke any Salvinorin during this trip. However, the Salvia entity visited me while I was tripping on mescaline, taking me on a brief journey and offering a cool, peaceful retreat from the brutal temperature. I have now smoked Salvinorin outdoors several times. on some of these occasions there is little difference from my journeys done indoors, but at other times there is a deeper perception and feeling into the plant life around me. On one occasion I was very tempted to hug a large cactus, although I fortunately resisted this urge. A more startling revelation occurred when I smoked Salvinorin in a meadow. At the edge of this meadow were some redwood trees a couple hundred feet tall. Upon coming out of the Salvinorin trance I found myself looking at these trees, and had a powerful realization that I was staring at beings who were several hundred years old, and had been here long before the first white man had been in the area or any modem technology had been developed.

At the time of this journey there was some very unusual weather which shifted between rain, sunshine, wind, and hail, every 10 minutes or less. I tend to enjoy tripping at times like this when the sky seems pregnant with energy, and before smoking the Salvinorin I opened a window and propped myself on the bed so I could look into the garden outside. Upon smoking the Salvinorin I was transported to a dimension where it seemed that all of creation was visible to me. The entire universe was turning inside-out and then outside-in in a rapidly repeating manner. As this occurred, the \"outside\" or negative universe was seen to be an exact replica of the \"inside\" or manifest material universe. These two sides balanced and flowed through one another like a galactic, multi-dimensional yin-yang. The intricacy and perfection of this \"dance,\" this movement and interpretation of the two halves of Form and Emptiness, was spectacular. and can probably best be described as appearing like a cosmic, animated Escher painting. The entire surface of the universe could be seen as though existing on the interior surface of a giant sphere. With the movement, part of the universe would flow through the center of this sphere, where it seemed that I was staring down the \"axis\" where form and non-form met and flowed through each other. This \"axis\" I was staring down also existed within the curved universe, and seemed to curve around and come back behind my head. Each time a cycle of turning inside-out was completed, the last object that would traverse the gate to the opposite side was my own body and being. As I observed all this I felt a loving connection reaching out to everything in the universe, coupled with pristine clarity and vastly expanded consciousness. At some point I had a revelation where I perceived all form, all creation, as the male counterpart to being. At this same time, I realized there was a female counterpart to manifest creation, which was the emptiness or space from which, and in which, all of this had been created. I had a powerful experience of this Divine Mother and felt the love with which she gave of herself so that existence could come into being, and the love that she feels for all of existence. There were intense feelings of sweeping joy and happiness, and of being in complete harmony with everything. As I gradually started to come out of this state file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (35 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum I went through a cycle of powerful emotions which repeated at first every few seconds, slowing to where I would feel each emotion for a minute or two. I distinctly recall feelings of awe, wonder, and reverence beyond anything I'd felt before. At the time I got out of bed I was still in unison with this magnificent experience. For the first time I can remember I had the feeling that all of my shells and protections, which normally produce a certain distance and separation from life, had been completely removed. To a certain degree this feeling is common with most psychedelics, but I had never experienced anything even approaching this degree of freedom. I was fully and immediately embracing the universe and anything it may place in my path, as it was all a part of the Divine Mother, it seemed that my entire life had been spent behind a sheet of glass that had become grimier and grimier over time, and all of a sudden this glass had been whisked away and the universe was before me with a new and startling clarity. Much to my chagrin, these shells gradually formed around nit during the next half hour. But there remains to this day a connection to this immaculate state, and a desire to live closer to it and someday experience it again. Much of what I experienced in this session has been felt in subsequent journeys. In particular, the perception of the universe turning rapidly inside-out, and seen as though occupying the interior of a sphere, occurs nearly every time I smoke Salvinorin. Siebert has commented on this perceived \"flattening out\" of the universe as \"it is not so much that the universe becomes two dimensional, it's more that I move into a higher dimension, from where everything appears \"flat,\" similar to how two dimensional objects appear to our normal perception.\" The cycle of repeating emotions and sensations is also very common. Often this includes feelings of complete disbelief and confusion at what is being experienced. alternating with total understanding of the situation, and even hilarious laughter at how I normally don't recognize the now obvious state of affairs. The experience described above was about one and one-half hours in duration. Most subsequent experiments have also shown increased duration of the Salvinorin trip if taken while on LSD or 2C-B, along with potentiation of the Salvinorin. #16 D.M. Turner - 10 chewed Salvia divinorum leaves I recently had my first opportunity to chew fresh Salvia divinorum leaves and obtain an experience through this method of use. I took 10 large freshly-picked leaves from a Wasson clone which I rolled into \"cigars\" of S leaves each. The experience was done indoors, in complete darkness, at 3.00 AM when there would be almost no traffic noise. As I began to chew the leaves I realized it would not he possible to chew and hold all 10 leaves in my mouth for 10 minutes. By the time I had chewed just one-third to one-half of a cigar, my mouth was So full of chewed leaf and saliva that I could not open it to take in any more. I ended up holding each mouthful for 4 minutes, before spitting it out and immediately chewing some more. The whole process of consuming the leaves file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (36 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum took about 20 minutes. The taste of the leaves was quite bitter, and as they were chewed to a vibrant green froth I was also overwhelmed with intense green/chlorophyll energy. This is comparable to the energy I feel from drinking wheat-grass juice, only much stronger. It stains the tongue green. After 20 minutes of chewing I felt thoroughly permeated by the Salvia. I entered into an experience of what is probably moderate intensity for chewing the leaves. As the sensations came on there was nothing that really surprised me, as the feelings were of the same essence as those from my smoked Salvia journeys. The first thing I noticed was the flowing, green, vine-like matrix that I often see in my journeys. In this case, however, the motion of the visual image, and feelings that accompanied it, were much slower, smoother, and softer than usual. This slower movement actually allowed me to see more of the intricacies and detail of the matrix. Green was the only color that appeared in my visuals this evening, and having just chewed the vibrantly green leaves I was more appreciative of this aspect of the Salvia entity's manifestation. There was a feeling that I was completely supported by and wrapped in the Salvia matrix, which was very relaxing and comfortable. As I watched and was engulfed in this matrix, there was a short time during which I lost awareness of myself as something separate from it, and I actually felt I'd become part of the matrix. When this occurred I received a very clear impression, along with the words, that \"I was no longer under the influence of time.\" At one point there was also a sensation of being amphibious. Compared with smoked Salvia, this experience was more pleasant and easy. Throughout the experience I felt an energy running through me that was very healing and seemed to be realigning things. This seemed to work primarily on a subtle energy level which also affected me physically and mentally. And I've continued to feel the benefits from this experience for several days now. Siebert has remarked that this healing quality is frequently present when the leaves are chewed but seems to be lacking when they're smoked. During the experience I found I was easily distracted by noises, and would have to refocus to stay with the journey. I've been told that when one is tripping on chewed Salvia divinorum simply opening the eyes will take one out of the experience, and upon shutting the eyes one will resume the journey where they left off. As the effects were wearing off I also noticed that 1 would get distracted by thoughts, and would have to put them aside to continue with the journey. The entire experience lasted about one hour. I emerged from it feeling centered and refreshed on many levels, and there were no aftereffects of any kind. Conclusions The experiences described above are a representative sampling of both my own and other's encounters with Salvia divinorum. I consider these to be the most diverse and inexplicable of any of my psychedelic adventures. file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (37 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum Although I've now used Salvinorin over 30 times it still has the ability to feel completely novel, fresh, and unpredictable with each use. The results reported by the small group who have tried this mysterious substance show a wide and diverse range of effects and experiences, and suggest a greater potential for both dangers and revelatory insights than exists with other entheogens. Many have found the experience of pure Salvinorin A to be alarmingly intense, and feel working with the whole plant material to be safer and more assimilable. Salvia divinorum appears to be a plant in possession of a vast treasury of knowledge and experience. which is just beginning to make acquaintance with and be noticed by humans. Those who have connected with her sublime and fantastic realm feel Salvia divinorum has something very precious to offer us. Bibliography Johnson, J.B. 1939 The Elements of Mazatec Witchcraft.

There are dozens of Salvia species, but Salvia divinorum is the only one known to contain the diterpenes salvinorin A (at 96%) and salvinorin B (at 4%). The plant has hollow, square stems with winged edges. It has opposed sets of ovate leaves that are finely dentate along the edges and grow to 8\" in length. The stems are not very sturdy, but with support, the plant can grow to 8' tall. Filtered sunlight is best, and the plant likes plenty of water and humidity. It rarely sets seed, and when it does the seeds are usually not viable. In the wild, the plant propagates by falling over, and sending out roots where it touches the ground. In a high humidity environment, it is not uncommon to see roots forming on the stem even before the plant has fallen over. In cultivation, cuttings can be taken and this is very easy to do. Using scissors, cut off a branch tip that has 4 to 6 sets of leaves on it and about 4\" of stalk below that. Place the cutting in water so most of the bare stalk is covered; tap water is fine and you don't need to add any nutrients. The cutting may wilt for a day or two, but should be fine after that. Mist the cutting frequently or keep it in a high humidity environment to ease the shock of being cut. When taking cuttings in summer, wait until the evening when cooler temperatures prevent excessive wilting. In about one week, nodes appear on the stalk where the roots will emerge. In another week, roots will grow out to a length of 1/4 to 3/4\" long - this is the time to transplant into soil. Keeping the cutting in water beyond this point will deprive it of nutrients, and longer roots are more susceptible to damage during transplanting. Transplant into a 4\"-6\" pot using commercial potting soil or formulate your own. I make a mixture of 1 part compost, 1 part peat moss, 1 part sandy loam and 1/2 part perlite. Salvia divinorum likes a friable soil rich in humus and with good drainage, avoid heavy soils with clay in them. The plant likes a lot of root space; repot often for maximum growth. When you see growth start to slow down, or the plant starting to look ragged, it's time to repot. The ideal temperature range is in the 60s, but my plants have survived hot spells of 100° and night time temps as low as 35°. In hot weather, make sure the plants have enough shade and plenty of water with file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (39 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum frequent misting. In the summer when my plants are outside on my deck, I keep them under 60% shade cloth. I have misters that come on six times a day for one minute, which is long enough to wet all the foliage. The misters are controlled by an electronic timer that screws onto my outside faucet. My plants can put on 4'-5' of growth during the 6 months they are outside. I have heard that the Salvinorin content is higher in the summer, but this is anecdotal information. In the fall, growth slows as temperature and light levels decrease. If the temperature falls below freezing, the plant will immediately turn black and die. If the root ball has not frozen, the plant can grow back - often quite prolifically because it has a large root system supporting the new growth. I know it's time to bring my plants inside when the leaves start to blush red from the cold nights - this disappears in a few weeks after being indoors. Plants will flower in the fall when day length falls to about 10-12 hours of light a day. If you are bringing your plants inside under artificial light, you can abort flowering by increasing the light to 14-16 hours a day. The plants will then go back to vegetative growth and put their energy into leaf production. I enjoy the flowers, so I keep my lights on for only 12 hours a day and let the plants go through their cycle. Each plant sends up a spike that can grow to be a foot in length, filled with many small blue and white flowers. The flowers have a very delicate, spicy scent. Each flower spike will last about a month, but if you have many plants all in different phases of flowering, the whole process will last 2-3 months. I know people who have grown Salvia divinorum for years and it has never flowered for them, even though the plants go through a period of shortened day length. The plants tend to get leggy during flowering, and lose some of their lower leaves, and in general look a little ragged. Once flowering is over, I start increasing the light cycle and the plants return to vegetative growth. Light can be increased up to 18 hours a day for maximum growth, beyond this can be detrimental to the plants. I am not a big fan of the high priced fluorescent grow lights marketed under names such as Vita Lite, Agro Lite and Grolux. One of these 4' bulbs costs about $15 - you could buy 5-6 standard fluorescent bulbs for this price and they are almost as good. Compared to sunlight, fluorescent bulbs emit light predominantly in the blue spectrum which encourage leaf and stem growth. These bulbs are low in red wavelength light which promotes flower development. Unlike Cannabis where the goal is flower production, the aim with Salvia divinorum is leaf production, so fluorescent lights are fine. Of course natural sunlight is best, but unless you have a greenhouse or a sunny location indoors, fluorescent bulbs will maintain your plants through the winter until you can get them back outside in the spring. High Pressure Sodium (HPS) or Metal Halide (MH) lights can also be used. They come in 400w and 1000w sizes, and unless you have a large area to cover, the 400w is plenty. A 400w MH system costs about $200 and puts out as many lumens as 20 fluorescent bulbs. This fixture would provide enough light for an 8'x8' growing space. You need to be sure to keep the light 2' above the tops of the plants; if the leaves start to blush red, the light is too close. Leaves will lighten in color when exposed to high light levels; this is fine and does not effect potency. Using one of these lights will require more humidity as the extra heat they give off will dry out the leaves quicker. HPS lights are higher in the red spectrum file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (40 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum and emit a golden light, MH are a more balanced light and would be better for use with Salvia divinorum. The main thing you hear about Salvia divinorum is how much humidity they need, but this is not true. Yes, the plants enjoy high humidity, and will achieve optimum growth in high humidity, but they can grow just fine in much less humid conditions. The trick is to slowly acclimate the plant to a lower humidity environment over the course of several weeks. If you have ordered a cutting by mail, chances are good it came from a high humidity environment in a greenhouse. Give it high humidity initially by misting it often or placing it in a tent with a humidifier, but slowly reduce the humidity over the course of the next month and the plant will do just fine, and with much less hassle for you. In the winter when my plants are indoors, I cover the walls with plastic sheeting and spray the plants 3 times a day with a pump-style tank sprayer. This takes less than 5 minutes every time I spray them and I never have a problem with leaf edges turning brown, which is the typical sign that the humidity is too low. If you are going to grow your plants in a high humidity environment, don't make the mistake of thinking that you don't need to water them much - they will still require regular watering even with humidity levels in the 90% range. I do not like using tightly sealed tents or other grow chambers, these do not allow for a healthy flow of air and such stagnant conditions encourage the growth of molds and bacteria. The most common pests of Salvia divinorum are whiteflies and aphids. They both live on the underside of the leaves, preferring the new growth on the top half of the plant. Aphids will also cluster on the stems. Whiteflies are small insects with bright white wings, their pupa are light green and look like small grains of rice. All stages suck on plant juices, and heavily infested plants will yellow and grow poorly. If the infestation is left unchecked, the plants can be killed from a black sooty mold that grows on the honeydew that the whiteflies and aphids produce. I have had good results combating whitefly (and to a lesser degree aphids) simply spraying the underside of the leaves with a solution of 1 tsp. liquid castile soap (such as Dr. Bronner's unscented) to 1 qt. of water. The soap breaks down the insects' protective coating and they drown. The plants can be rinsed off the following day with clean water. You will want to repeat this procedure once a week for a couple of weeks to kill any pupa that survived the initial spraying and have turned into adults. Aphids are a little more resistant to a simple castile soap spray, so I recommend using insecticidal soap on them, such as Safer brand. These soaps contain salts of fatty acids and are quite safe to use, even within days of harvest. The directions say the soap can be left on, but I wash the leaves off the following day after application just to be safe. There are some biological controls that work wonderfully. The parasitic wasp Encarsiaformosa is very effective against whiteflies. These tiny wasps are barely visible to the eye, they lay their eggs inside developing whitefly pupa, so one of their young hatches out instead of the whitefly. For aphids, try ladybugs or Aphidoletesaphidimyza. file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (41 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum I fertilize my plants about once a month with fish emulsion when they are outdoors in the summer. In the winter I use Stern's Miracid (S. divinorum likes acidic soil.) Feeding a lot of nitrogen to your plants will attract more problem insects to them, so cut back on fertilizing as part of the strategy to bring pests under control. For all practical purposes, the lifespan of a Salvia divinorum plant is about 5-6 years. The plants get woody as they age, growth slows and they become more brittle and start to fall apart. If they have been staked and prevented from falling over and rerooting, then it is time to take some cuttings and start again. Cuttings from an old plant will show the same vigor as cuttings from a younger plant. Salvia divinorum leaves should be dried in a food dehydrator on a medium high setting (130 - 140 degrees). At this temperature, drying will take between 1 - 2 hours depending on the size of the leaves. I remove the mid ribs on the large leaves and they never take more than 1 hour to dry. Drying at lower temperatures causes the leaves to lose their green color and turn brown. Once dry, I push the leaves through a sieve to powder them, then pack the powder tightly into glass vials and store in the freezer - potency will be retained for many years this way. Fresh leaves can be stored in the refrigerator for a few days before losing potency, keep them in a plastic bag with a damp paper towel. Freezing fresh leaves does not work, when thawed they turn into a slimy mess. Leaves can be juiced using a wheat grass juicer and then frozen for long term storage - when thawed, the juice is held in the mouth as is done with the fresh leaves. Dried leaves can be reconstituted by soaking in a small amount of water and then chewed. It is my hope that many people will grow Salvia divinorum; it is one of the rarest of all plant entheogens. It was almost driven into extinction once, let's preserve this species so future generations can learn from this valuable plant ally. file:///G|/hidownload/toc.html (42 of 42)3/12/2004 7:37:43 AM"}]
