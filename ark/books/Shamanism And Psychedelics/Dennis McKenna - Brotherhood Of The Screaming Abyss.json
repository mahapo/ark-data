"},{"pageContent":"Foreword When Dennis asked me to write a foreword for this book, I was surprised anddelighted. It had never occurred to me that such a book would require anyforeword at all. Dennis is a well-respected researcher and thinker, and many ofus have read his scientific papers or listened with pleasure to hisinterdisciplinary lectures, which combine ethnobotany, psychopharmacology,history, and philosophical reflections. But this is not an academic book. It isthe long-awaited account of his lifelong relationship with his older brotherTerence, the great raconteur of wide-reaching philosophical and eschatologicalideas. In other words, what we have here is the privilege of going behind thecurtains and peering into the private lives of these two extraordinary brothers,the poet and the scientist, the public figure and the more retiring originatorof ideas, one who haunts us from the invisible yet pervasive World Wide Web (hiswords still fresh and even more relevant twelve years after his death), theother still with us, wise, and with an acute sense of humor. Like his brother,Dennis is a teacher from whom we still have much to learn.I had the great good luck to meet Terence in my native Colombia at the end of1971, when we were both still young. It was the beginning of a friendship thatlasted until 2000, the year he died. I met Dennis in 1981, though in a sense Iknew him well before then, because Terence spoke frequently of his brother,describing him as a genius and the source of some of the ideas that captivatedhim.When Terence and I met, I was on vacation, visiting my family in Florencia, thena small frontier town located between the flanks of the Cordillera Oriental, theEastern range of the Andes, and the Amazon rainforest. I recently had finishedfive years of studies at the Universidad Complutense in Madrid and planned toreturn to Europe two months later. Earlier the same year, Terence, Dennis, andsome friends, while traveling in the Colombian Amazon area, had performed whatthey called the “experiment at La Chorrera,” later described by Terence in hisbook True Hallucinations. Terence was an enthusiastic and effervescent thinker,and I was an eager listener and interlocutor. Terence and his companion at thetime, known in this book as “Ev,” moved with me to “Villa Gloria,” a pompousname for a simple wooden country house that belonged to my parents. Located afew kilometers outside Florencia, with one faucet and no electricity, the placehad the advantage of seclusion for work and experimentation. Terence wasstarting to write what later became The Invisible Landscape with his brotherDennis as coauthor, while I was being introduced to the world of Carl Jung,Mircea Eliade, Alfred North Whitehead, James Joyce, and Carlos Castaneda. I hadmy first yajé experience in Villa Gloria, with a potion prepared by Don ApolinarYacanamijoy, an Ingano shaman I had known since childhood, though at that time Iwas uninformed about the indigenous uses of that substance.Two years later, in 1973, Terence and I were in Berkeley. This was a crucialsummer for me in that, thanks in part to him, I discovered a wealth ofethnobotanical studies by the field’s great pioneers: Richard Evans Schultes,Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff, Gordon Wasson, Peter Furst, Johannes Wilbert, MichaelHarner, and others whom I had the privilege of meeting at different points laterin my life. In the evenings, when we weren’t watching the Watergate hearings onan old TV, Terence entertained his spellbound friends with his eloquence, hiscommand of ideas in various disciplines, and his great gifts as a storyteller.His was not a modest enterprise: only “the big picture” would suffice. There wasnever a dull moment in his company, and I accepted, albeit naively anduncritically, virtually everything he said. I was even expecting the end oftimes on December 21, 1973, before his revision of the final ingression ofnovelty in his “Timewave Zero” model to December 21, 2012, a date that coincideswith the end of the present era in keeping with the Mayan calendar. The months Ispent with Terence in Villa Gloria and Berkeley were perhaps the mostinteresting of my life. Those extraordinary conversations catapulted me intoyears of passionate interdisciplinary research that tempered my enthusiasm andgave me a firmer ground from which to work, without ever weakening theadmiration I had for him.In 1980, Terence would once again play a decisive role in the path of my life. Iwent to visit him and his wife Kat Harrison at their home in Sebastopol,California. Terence had been told about Don Emilio Andrade Gómez, anayahuasquero whom he had never met who lived close to Iquitos, Peru. Don Emiliosoon became one of my dear friends and mentors. He was the person who introducedme to the concept of plants as teachers, calling ayahuasca one of the doctoresfrom whom it is possible to learn. He also opened me to the world of ayahuascavegetalista traditions as practiced by the mestizo population of the PeruvianAmazon.Since we met, my working relationship with Dennis has been even closer than myfriendship with his brother, since I only saw Terence sporadically during theyears when his fame peaked. Dennis and I did fieldwork, traveled, and publishedtogether. We’ve stayed in luxurious hotels at conferences in various countriesas well as in humble posadas in the Amazon. I have visited him in every citywhere he and his wife Sheila have lived. And, above all, Dennis and I haveexperienced great adventures of the mind together due to our common interest inpsychoactive plants and modified states of consciousness.In 1985, I invited him to participate in what was the first international andinterdisciplinary symposium on ayahuasca, which I organized in Bogotá as part ofthe forty-fifth International Congress of the Americanists, an academicconference that takes place every two years, alternating between Europe and theAmericas. After the event, I flew to Pucallpa, Peru, where Dennis introduced meto the artist Pablo Amaringo, with whom I collaborated for several years. Ourbook, Ayahuasca Visions: The Religious Iconography of a Peruvian Shaman, firstpublished in 1991, explores the complexity and sophistication of the Peruvianmestizo ayahuasca tradition. In 1988, Pablo and I created the Usko-AyarAmazonian School of Painting, which was destined to have a lasting influence onthe art scene of the Peruvian Amazon. By the time I resigned in 1995, the schoolhad grown to some 300 students, all of whom got their tuition and art materialsfree of charge. During the last ten years, Dennis has been one of the mainlecturers at Wasiwaska, Research Center for the Study of PsychointegratorPlants, Visionary Art and Consciousness, a small educational institution that mywife Adriana Rosa and I created in southern Brazil. Dennis always arrives withnew ideas and an intellectual curiosity that has grown with time. His presencehas become ever more significant in the current transcultural andinterdisciplinary global community concerned with the large questions oftemporality, reality, and consciousness.It has been a real treat for me to read The Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss.I had heard Terence and Dennis relate fragments of their stories here and there,but it is not the same as experiencing the continuous chronological narrativepresented in these pages. I gained new insights into their background anddevelopment. Dennis’s narrative is lively, often humorous, and at times brutallyfrank. He gives his straightforward opinion about people and events, as well asastute observations about political, ethical, and transcendent questions. Thisbook is not only a biographical account, but also a portrait of thecounterculture of the sixties, seventies, and eighties in certain regions of theUnited States, an era with a marked global impact, avidly scrutinized bysegments of today’s youth in these times of planetary crisis, and renewedinterest in modified states of consciousness and alternative worldviews. Inreading this book, I have learned a great deal that I did not know about thelives of my two great friends. In addition, I got the chance to relive andreflect on my generation’s time in history.Dennis convinced me to write this preface by saying that I was there pretty muchat the beginning of Terence’s career as a bard, and also at the end. In thesummer of 1999, Dennis and I decided to spend some days with Terence in Hawaii.His brain tumor had been diagnosed, and he was considering what path to followwhile dealing with his emotions. Dennis and I would have liked to pull the plugon all electronic communication and work on Terence’s health with the tools towhich we have dedicated our lives. Much to our chagrin, Terence continued towork furiously on the preparations for what became the AllChemical ArtsConference dedicated to psychedelics and creativity that took place in Septemberthat year in Hawaii. On March 20, 2000, following a conference entitled“Ayahuasca: Amazonian Shamanism, Science, and Spirituality” organized by RalphMetzner in San Francisco, Dennis and I went to see Terence, who was spending thelast weeks of his life in the home of friends in California. He was in awheelchair, barely able to speak. At some point he said: “I am havinghallucinations.” Dennis asked: “Do you mean psychedelic hallucinations?” Hesaid: “What are psychedelic hallucinations?” At the end of our visit, I embracedTerence and thanked him for all he had given me. As I was leaving, just a fewsteps from him, he suddenly said with a faint voice: “Buena suerte.” I knew Iwould not see him again. I was back home in Brazil when the phone rang on April3. It was Dennis. He was crying as he told me that Terence had just passed away.Later, I went outside to contemplate the sky. As Dennis put it, Terence was bythen traveling up and down the genetic ladder, becoming his parents and hischildren at one and the same time. Perhaps he is waiting for us now in themystery of eternity. Luis Eduardo LunaWasiwaskaFlorianópolis, BrazilAugust 3, 2012 "},{"pageContent":"Preface For those who lived through what is sometimes called the Psychedelic Revolution,Terence McKenna is a legend. Once referred to as “the intellectual’s TimothyLeary,” Terence attained iconic status as a radical philosopher, futurist,cultural critic, and raconteur. His unorthodox ideas about the evolutionary andcultural impact of psychedelic drugs shocked many and resonated with manyothers. In 1971, we embarked on an expedition to the Amazon, bent on uncoveringthe real mystery behind the psychedelic experience. As chronicled in his bookTrue Hallucinations, that journey has become the stuff of contemporary myth. Ouradventures inspired many of Terence’s unorthodox ideas about time and the natureof history, which in turn became fertile ground for certain apocalyptic beliefsabout the year 2012.Terence died in 2000, never to learn if his predictions about the end of theworld, in his particular sense, were true. Since then, he has achieved a kind ofvirtual immortality, his voice and image as near as the click of a mouse.Ghost-like, he haunts the Internet, a talking head on YouTube, the articulateprophet of an end time he didn’t live to see. In addition to TrueHallucinations, Terence authored or coauthored several books, including Food ofthe Gods, The Archaic Revival, The Evolutionary Mind, and The InvisibleLandscape, among others. His wide-ranging thoughts and observations remain asfresh and timely as though uttered yesterday. He lives on as the belovedpaterfamilias of a younger generation of psychedelic seekers, though most werestill in diapers when Terence was at the peak of his career.As Terence’s younger brother and only sibling, I grew up with him in a smalltown in western Colorado during the fifties and sixties. Traveling together inthe Colombian Amazon in 1971 with a few other kindred spirits, we called ourband “the Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss.” Even on the cusp of uncoveringthe mysteries of existence, my brother and I managed to keep a sense of humor;it helped to be Irish. We didn’t know what we were searching for beyond theconviction it was a profound insight, and that it would change us, andeverything, forever. We were right on both counts, though not in the ways weimagined.Terence was twenty-four at the time; I was only twenty. In 1975, we co-wrote TheInvisible Landscape, our first attempt to construct a rational explanation forwhat happened to us on that trip. In 1993, Terence recounted our experiencesmore directly in True Hallucinations, but still with important elements elidedor omitted. What has since been memorialized in the annals of psychedelia as“the experiment at La Chorrera” was a pivotal moment for both of us. The curiousevents that overtook us in that primeval rainforest haunted Terence until theend of his life, and surely the same will someday be said of me.As Terence’s brother, I helped him create and develop many of “his” ideas. Ouradventures—intellectual and otherwise—spanned the turbulent decades of the latetwentieth century. Driven by a shared passion, novelty and a yearning foranswers to the ultimate questions, we traveled to the ends of the earth andexplored the outer limits of the psychedelic experience. The quest that seizedboth of us at an early age was to discover insights into the astonishingmysteries of time, mind, and the improbable reality of existence.While our lives were entangled as only the lives of brothers can be, after theevents at La Chorrera we later found ourselves on separate paths. Terence becamethe spokesman for the alien dimensions accessed through psychedelics, aphilosopher of the unspeakable, a beloved and sometimes reviled bard of themarvels and occasional terrors waiting in the recesses of human consciousness.By choice and inclination, I stayed in the background, pursuing a scientificcareer in disciplines that ranged from ethnopharmacology and ethnobotany toneuroscience.Since Terence’s death, we’ve witnessed the first decade of a new era that by allearly indications will be as strange and disturbing, as full of hope anddespair, as any period that humanity has yet endured. The closer I’ve gotten tohis predicted end date for the world, however, the more I’ve been drawn to lookback at how our personal world began. I wanted to retrace the journey that tookus from childhood to our separate destinies, stopping to revisit the people andideas that shaped us. Surely our lives were destined to be unique in many ways,as all lives are, and yet I’ve also realized how much Terence and I were theproducts of our age and its dreams. My hope is that many others will see theirown experiences reflected in those that befell us. This is our story. "},{"pageContent":"Part One - Beginnings[images/00039.jpg]Black Canyon, Colorado. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 1 - Beginnings [images/00021.jpg]> Terry and Denny, 1952. In many respects this book is about time. Its very structure relies on aparticular understanding of time borrowed from the view of it that prevails inour culture. From Judeo-Christian perspective, time is a linear arrow with abeginning, middle, and end. For good or ill, and whether “true” or not, thislinear conception of time permeates the Western worldview. It certainlyinfluenced the idea of time that Terence and I shared while growing up. In fact,had we lived in a culture that viewed time as cyclical, this tale could haveended very differently, or never been told at all. I’ll have a lot more to sayabout middles and ends later, but right now let’s look at beginnings.I say “beginnings” because any single point of origin for this book is hard tonail down. In the narrowest sense, the project began in the spring of 2011 when,having decided to undertake it, I took steps to make it happen. The story Iwanted and needed to tell was summed up by its subtitle: “My Life with TerenceMcKenna.” I knew, of course, that many of those who were familiar with Terence’swork had already heard or read about me before. As the brother of acontroversial and charismatic cultural icon, a renowned teller of tall tales, Iwas already the character in a narrative that a man known as the Irish bard ofpsychedelia had told and retold many times. But that was Terence’s account, notmine. There existed another version of those events known only to me.Having made the decision to share my side of our story, I had to create a way toactualize it. Past experience had taught me that authors are rarely wellcompensated for their efforts; purely mercenary reasons led me to an alternativeapproach that would maximize my return. Somehow I needed to find the resourcesto self-publish the book and to “buy” the time to complete the task. “Time ismoney,” our father often reminded us, and was he ever right! After consultingwith a number of people in the publishing industry, I turned to “crowd funding,”a new fundraising strategy best exemplified by the website Kickstarter. And itworked, beyond my wildest expectations. I made Kickstarter history by raisingmore money for a book project than ever before on the site. The window for thefundraising effort closed on June 6, 2011. What I wrote a few days later,condensed below, reflects my dread and elation at realizing the means toundertake my task had just been dropped into my lap: > Well, here I am. These are the first words I’ve committed to paper for what is> supposed to be my magnum opus, The Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss. After a> successful Kickstarter campaign, I now have the funds to cover> self-publishing, and (hopefully) to secure the time to write this screed. And> time is short! During the Kickstarter appeal, I plumbed the depths of social> media, putting myself “out there” in numerous podcasts, websites, and> webinars.

It was notuntil early September that various commitments allowed me to begin in earnest.During the summer, I had traveled to California to attend a wedding in thefamily. In October I was off again, this time to Colorado, where theninety-seventh birthday of a beloved aunt brought me back to many of my boyhoodhaunts on the Western Slope. What seemed like interruptions at the time wereactually part of the process, a chance to reflect on what, and whom, my storywas really about.The longest pause was a trip that August to Iquitos, Peru. Reality hadintervened in the form of a three-week intensive course in the jungle forfourteen pharmacy students, most from the University of Missouri–Kansas City. Tocall it a “course in the jungle” is a bit of an exaggeration; much of it tookplace in and around dirty, noisy, chaotic, vibrant Iquitos, with occasional daytrips to the surrounding forest. The kids had a cushy B&B to return to everynight, a swimming pool, good food, Wi-Fi, and plenty of bandwidth for theubiquitous iPhones and iPads. Hardly roughing it. We later spent three days at acamp on the Napo River north of Iquitos. Overall, it was pleasant work, and thecompensation for a few lectures too good to pass up.Iquitos and I go way back. I had first visited the city in 1981 as a graduatestudent at the University of British Columbia, off to conduct fieldwork for mythesis. But even that visit was a return of sorts, an evocation of my first tripto the Amazon with Terence almost exactly a decade earlier. Terence also joinedme for part of that second expedition, which marked yet another crucial point inour lives, closing a chapter that began with our trip to La Chorrera even as itopened another. Though we remained close as time went on, our lives tookparallel tracks. For one thing, Terence never again visited South America, whileI kept finding reasons to return.Iquitos, at first glance, looked pretty good to me on that visit in 1981, havingjust spent a month in Pucallpa, a frontier town to the south, under conditionsthat even then qualified as primitive. Iquitos, a city on the Amazon—indeed thefarthest major port from the Atlantic almost 2,000 miles away—was the epitome ofcivilization by comparison. The prospect of a cheap hotel room, a cold shower(no hot water then), and a colder beer loomed large on my agenda.Iquitos has changed in many ways since then, due largely to the influx ofayahuasca tourists. I suppose my research in ethnopharmacology has fed theinterest in that psychedelic brew, so I share a small part of the credit for thenew Iquitos, or blame, depending on how one sees it. In 1981, Iquitos wascharming, a sleepy hamlet of maybe 50,000 souls, not the hammering, noisy cityof 400,000 that awaited me in 2011. There were no three-wheeled motocarros backthen, now the bane of Iquitos, and only a few automobiles. Many of thecharacters of modern botanical legend—Richard Evans Schultes, Tim Plowman, AlGentry, Nicole Maxwell, Gunther Schaper, Neil Towers—were familiar with thetown, and I’ve had the good fortune to know some of them. As it had for them,Iquitos played a formative role in the course of my scientific career.I’ve lost count of the times I’ve returned to Iquitos. One reason I keep comingback is my interest in the mestizo shamanism that flourishes there. Iquitos isboth the gateway into the upper Amazon and a center for the many indigenouspeoples who over the decades have been compelled to leave their ancestral lands.As such, the city has become a repository of cultural knowledge, much of itrelated to plants and their medicinal uses.Another reason I return is my friendship with Juan Ruiz Macedo, an amazingbotanist who knows the region’s plant life as well any other. Juan is now thecurator of the Herbarium Amazonense at the Universidad Nacional de la AmazoníaPeruana. In 1981, he was working under the herbarium’s former curator, FranklinAyala, his mentor and supervisor. My supervisor, Neil Towers, Ph.D., had writtenme a letter of introduction that I gave to Ayala, who assigned poor Juan thethankless task of leading a small band of geeky and basically clueless NorthAmerican tenderfoots into the jungles on the Río Ampiyacu, the “river ofpoisons.” That’s another story, as we shall see. When Ayala later retired towork on a massive study of plants in the Peruvian Amazon, Juan assumed the topposition admirably, and we have worked together on various projects in recentyears. [images/00010.jpg]> Central and Northern Peru (Map by M. Odegard) But over years, Iquitos has lost much of its charm for me. In 2011, I found thestreets torn up all over town for a massive sewage re-engineering project, nodoubt sorely needed. In addition to the usual crowded sidewalks pocked with(often) gaping holes, construction machinery and concrete blocks were strewneverywhere, making it more crucial than ever to watch your step. But the truescourge remains the motocarros, which over the years have solved Iquitos’smass-transit problems, at an unfortunate price. Thirty to sixty cents gets youanywhere in the city in about twenty minutes, but on vehicles that are noisy,dirty, and proliferating. I’ve often thought that, with some international help,Iquitos could be turned into a “green” model for post-petroleum mass transit indeveloping countries by converting those little carbon generators to electricpower; the result would be a cleaner, quieter mass-transit system quite unlikeanything else on earth.I have no hope of that happening soon, or ever. Iquitos has been moldering sinceits glory days during the Amazonian rubber boom a century ago, a burst of wealthextracted from the surrounding jungle, largely on the backs of the region’senslaved Indians. Under the rubber barons, life in old Iquitos was almostobscenely opulent for the upper crust and brutally hard for everyone else—whichmay not be so different from the new Iquitos, come to think of it.The city has a way of wearing me down. And this time, the noise of themotocarros, loudspeakers blaring from the electronics stores, the dust, thefumes, the oppressive heat, the sights, smells, and sheer urban madnessoverwhelmed me more quickly than ever. The same stimuli that initially madeIquitos exciting and exotic soon triggered a certain narrowing of focus, a kindof recoiling into a shell. To be honest, my visit in 2011 was cushy compared tomy earlier ones—I had my own apartment. But I felt it more this time. Old agewas creeping in.After the students left for Cuzco and Machu Picchu, I helped the ethnobotanistKathleen Harrison move into the apartment next to mine. Kat is my brother’sformer wife and the mother of their two grown children. We spent a few daysworking together in the herbarium, and then I left Iquitos, thinking I’d need avery good reason ever to return.I had planned to head straight to what would have been my first visit to theBurning Man festival in Nevada, but again reality intervened, this time in theform of some nagging health issues. Suffice it to say that it didn’t seem like agreat idea to spend four days in the desert with no water and primitive toilets.Instead, I returned home to Minnesota and threw myself into the project I’d toldso many I’d complete. As I write this today, on May 10, 2012, after eight monthsof work, I’ve finished a draft. And now that I have, my perspective has changedfrom “Can I do it?” to “I have done it.” Readers who have struggled with similarcreative endeavors will recognize the significance of this shift. There isplenty left to do, but the heavy lifting is over. I’ve been sleeping somewhatbetter as a result.But even as I say that, my comfortable writer’s life is about to end.Ironically, I’m about to depart for six weeks in Peru, beginning with a coursefor a group of pharmacy students in Iquitos. I said I’d need a good reason toreturn, knowing on some level I’d find a reason, or one would find me. Onceagain I’ll assume the fetal scrunch that modern air travel requires, put myselfinto a foggy daze, and squeeze through that uncomfortable wormhole to emergeinto the odd parallel universe that has figured so crucially in my fate. So that’s one take on where this book began. A far more important point oforigin lies much further back—or much, much further, depending on where youstart counting. We could begin with the Big Bang and the inflation of the cosmicegg into the universe of stars, galaxies, and planets in which we now findourselves, even if we have only the vaguest notions of how we got here, andalmost no understanding of why, or even if there is a “why.” But without thatprimordial event, there would have been no world in which our story, or anyother, could be set. I won’t go back quite that far, but I do feel obliged toexpress gratitude to whomever or whatever created this marvelous and improbableuniverse and thereby provided a stage for all souls to live out their fables andfoibles.Instead of recounting all creation, I’ll focus on my brother’s and mine. Ourfamily story begins with our ancestors, without whom we would not have existed.And like any other personal narrative, ours can be traced back to embryogenesis.Every human life so far has begun with the mingling of genes between a man and awoman. Given time and a little luck, the resulting embryo develops in the wombinto a viable infant that emerges into the world to begin its own unique journeythrough linear time, leaving its tracks on the continuum in ways that might makea difference in the order of things, or might not. In the near future, it may bepossible for humans to incarnate by other means like cloning, but not yetthrough complete gestation outside a living womb, as envisioned by Aldous Huxleyin his novel Brave New World. I might hope we’ll never achieve this capability,although it seems inevitable. One thing is certain: the entities generated bysuch a process will be something other than human, or at least not entirelyhuman.For now, anyway, it remains the case that every human being is the result of acombination of genes shared between a unique man and woman. That means you can’treally talk about beginnings without talking about the two individuals whoseshared genes initiated the life of that unique individual, their child. That wascertainly the case with Terence and me, two separate beings born of the samemother at different points in her life. I’m sure there were times when both ourparents wondered if they had somehow deviated from this universal scenario andgiven birth to the veritable spawn of Satan. I suppose sooner or later thisthought occurs to everyone who is blessed with challenging, rebellious offspringwho, from the womb, seem bent on testing a parent’s skills (and patience) to thelimit. Terence and I were (and are) most assuredly human—in many respects, alltoo human. To my parents, now long dead, I can only tender a belated apology forthe trouble we caused them, and ask the reader’s indulgence in accepting it ontheir behalf. It seems only fair to look back at their lives and families longbefore we arrived and disrupted things. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 2 - Three Sisters One way or another, directly or indirectly, my ancestors were drawn to Coloradoby the promise of wealth from the ground. My mother’s people made a living offthe fruit that grew on trees, my father’s came for the ore to be mined fromrock. It’s as if Terence and I were later compelled on a quest that somehowsynthesized theirs, searching for a modern analog to the philosopher’s stone inthe molecules of mushrooms and plants. Maybe our journey was the westward trekof our ancestors continued in another dimension.Looking for hints to our curious fate, I turned to our family’s past. As in anyfamily, there are certain types and quirks that seem to recur over generations,conveyed through biology and learning, of course, as well as other mechanismsunderstood by no one, but at least acknowledged by storytellers. I can tell youmy brother was not the first willful teenager in the lineage to flee home, orthe first to imagine he’d find what he was looking for in California. He wasn’tthe first to have a way with words, a love of books, or the terrible misfortuneof dying young. His private library was consumed by fire on two differentoccasions, each time destroying an eloquent statement of who he was; but eventhat, in a sense, may not have been unprecedented.If family lore can be trusted, a similar fate befell Teresa Aurelia Balena, bornin Salerno, Italy, on August 2, 1886. My maternal grandmother’s origins were amystery, even to her. Teresa’s parents died when she was very young, leaving heralone in an orphanage; all clues to her past were lost when the orphanage burneddown, taking her documents with it. Whether she was adopted before reachingAmerica, or arrived some other way, is also unclear. She may have been swept upin the “orphan trains” that beginning in 1854 carried some 200,000 orphans andstreet kids from the big eastern cities westward over the decades, to be handedout in towns along the way. Though portrayed at times as a shameful practicethat forced many children into virtual servitude, many others benefited. There’ssome evidence that Honey, as she became known, was not among the fortunate ones,at first. She ran away from her foster family at fifteen or sixteen, apparentlyfleeing mistreatment. Her luck changed when she eventually reached Riverside,California, where a kindly woman befriended her and gave her a good home.Honey was twenty-five in 1911 when she met Joseph Kemp, a Coloradan who hadtraveled to Southern California looking for seasonal work in the citrusorchards. Joseph, my grandfather, was thirteen years older than Honey and awidower with four kids. The earliest evidence of his verbal flair may have beenthe fact he returned from his fruit-picking sojourn with a new fiancée. Aftertheir marriage in 1912, the couple moved into a house our grandfather alreadyowned in Paonia, a town in the North Fork Valley on the western edge of theRockies. At the time, my grandfather was a fruit worker in that mile-high,temperate Eden, whose tree crops began gaining renown shortly after Europeansettlers drove out the area’s Ute Indians in the 1880s. Well into themid-twentieth century, the area’s two signature commodities remained cherriesand coal.Our mother, Hazelle, or Hadie as she was called, was Honey’s first child, bornon June 4, 1913. Another daughter, Mayme, was born in 1914, followed by Tress in1921, and a son, Harold, in 1925. Honey died of a heart attack in 1947, a fewyears before my birth. I’ve never heard her described as anything butexceptionally kind and decent, and I regret I never knew her. Her four children,our aunts and uncles, were very much a part of our world growing up. So were thetwo middle kids from our grandfather’s first family—daughter Murrie and sonClare. John and Margie, the youngest and the oldest, were rarely around, as Irecall.All told, our grandfather fathered and raised eight children, four with each ofhis two wives. By the time I showed up, he was known among his descendants asDad Kemp. He had been born prematurely in Janesville, Wisconsin on December 9,1873, a child so small he fit comfortably into a shoebox lined with cotton. Hismother, Nancy Narcissa Luce Kemp, used the warming oven of her kitchen stove asan incubator, which obviously worked. Dad Kemp enjoyed a robust life until hisdeath in 1959 at the age of eighty-six. By then he’d witnessed two world wars,the Korean War, the Great Depression, Prohibition and its repeal, the Dust Bowl,and the launch of new technologies ranging from the automobile and electriclight to radio, TV, and Sputnik. He married his first wife, Margaret Lucretia(Lu) Hossak, in 1900. The story was that Lu’s mother had murdered Lu’s father inhis sleep as a result of his constant abuse, which, if so, is perhaps theclosest thing in the family closet to an actual scandal. Lu died giving birth toher fourth child, Margie, in 1909.After returning to Paonia with Honey, his second wife, our grandfather heldseveral jobs, beginning in the local fruit industry. From 1927 until 1932, heserved as Paonia’s town clerk and later as an accountant at the local powercompany, a position he held until he lost his sight to glaucoma in his latefifties. His impact on us was profound and lasting. I only knew him in the finaldecade of his life, but even then he was a character, and many of the quirks ofpersonality that Terence and I shared can ultimately be traced to that man,whether due to genetics or from traits we picked up from being around him. Heloved language, loved using it, loved writing it, and that’s surely one reasonwhy Terence and I, both avid readers, took an early and lifelong delight inbooks, language, and all their possibilities. He had a touch of the Irish bardin him, though he wasn’t Irish; the Irish side of the family was my father’s. Iremember my grandpa using a white cane on the rare occasions he went out. Moreoften I encountered him sitting in a rocking chair in front of the tinypotbellied stove in his living room, always ready to reel off a story about hislife on the prairies during the pioneer days. He seemed to have an endless stockof stories and was always happy to share them with an attentive and fascinatedgrandson.Our grandfather was famous for his colorful phraseology. For instance, he calledsomething new or unusual a “fustilarian fizgig from Zimmerman.” A summerdownpour was a “frog strangler,” and a delicious meal or dish was “larrupin’.” Ihave no idea where these phrases originated, but they have persisted in ourfamily to this day. In fact, his fustilarian fizgigs from Zimmerman may havebeen my first introduction to the notion of something incomprehensible andalien, from another dimension or place. Needless to say, that concept becameuseful much later when we started dealing with DMT and other psychedelics. Thethings seen on DMT were and are fustilarian fizgigs from somewhere (even if onlyin one’s consciousness) and the characterization is at least as apt as Terence’slater descriptions of these alien entities as “singing elf machines” or“bejeweled hyper-dimensional basketballs.” I’ve seen fizgigs defined as a kindof fireworks that fizz as they whirl. Even better. It seems quite apt todescribe the objects seen on DMT as fizgigs of the mind.Our mother, smart and well read, had surely been influenced by her father’s loveof books and words as well. She was a small-town girl; indeed, our childhoodhome was on the same block in Paonia as hers, just a half a block or so upOrchard Avenue. All three Kemp sisters were known for their beauty and could goout with whomever they wanted, though what “going out” meant in those days isprobably not what we mean today. Occasionally, Hadie and Mayme, being close inage, competed for suitors. Mayme was exceptionally bright and managed to skip ayear in school, allowing both sisters to graduate from Paonia High Schooltogether in 1931. After graduation, our mother attended a business college inGrand Junction about seventy miles west of Paonia; later Mayme followed herthere. Such training was one of few options open to bright young women at thetime. [images/00028.jpg]> Joe and Hadie McKenna during World War II. Despite her humble origins, our mother was a remarkable woman who didn’t spendher entire life cloistered in Paonia. After completing her courses, she moved toDelta, the county seat thirty miles from Paonia, and took a job in the clerk andrecorder’s office. She was living in a boardinghouse when she met a handsomefellow tenant named Joe McKenna, who had recently arrived from the Colorado townof Salida to work as a shoe salesman. After a protracted courtship, our parentsmarried on June 10, 1937. Our father was an adventurous sort and fascinated byflying; he managed to get his pilot’s license the same year he was married. In1939, he rented a plane and flew our mother to an Elks convention in Chicago. Onthe way back, they ran out of gas and had to put down in a cornfield somewherein Kansas, turning the trip into more of an adventure than they had bargainedfor.Our parents eventually moved to Oakland, California, where our father sold shoesagain for a while. After the United States entered World War II, he enlisted,opted for flight school, and waited to be called up. He found a better if moredangerous job as a steel rigger in the Kaiser shipyards in nearby Richmond,where many of the new cargo vessels known as Liberty Ships were being built at agreat speed. The young couple’s California interlude ended abruptly when thecall arrived in 1943. My father’s dream of serving as a pilot ended when he waspassed over for flight training in favor of higher-priority cadets. Aftertraining, he reported for active duty with the rank of tech sergeant anddeparted for England to serve in the 615th Bombardment Squadron. By August 1944,he was a top gunner and engineer on a B-17 bomber flying over Europe andGermany.During that period, our mother worked in Oakland as a personal assistant (theterm then was “secretary”) to Henry J. Kaiser, one of the iconic industrialistsof the day, now remembered as the founder of Kaiser Aluminum, Kaiser Steel, theHMO Kaiser Permanente, and the philanthropic Kaiser Family Foundation. How shelanded in the office and sometimes, literally, in the lap of Kaiser, I am notcertain, but I fantasize that the comely young woman must have caught his eye ata company function staged for the benefit of the shipyard workers. Subsequentdiscreet enquiries would have revealed her to be fresh out of business schooland eminently qualified in all the secretarial arts—typing, dictation, filing—aswell as being quite easy on the eyes. Old Henry J. must have made an executivedecision that she was just what he needed to give his office a little class, tosay nothing of an efficient assistant. I have no idea if there was ever any realhanky-panky between them; I doubt it, but I do remember that Dad used to teaseMom about it. The fact is I think my parents were so much in love and enthralledwith each other that there was no room for jealousy. Dad was a very lucky man tohave our mother, and he knew it; they were in love right up until the day shedied.After surviving his combat missions, our father returned and became aninstructor at what I believe was the Army Air Field in Charleston, SouthCarolina. He mustered out of the service shortly after VE Day, 8 May 1945, whenthe war in Europe ended. After reuniting out East, my parents embarked on a roadtrip back to California. My mother’s job at Kaiser was waiting and my fatherexpected to work at an insurance company in San Francisco. Their itineraryincluded a stop in Paonia, where, on the spur of the moment, they decided tostay. They temporarily moved in with Dad Kemp, in our mother’s childhood home,until they could build a house of their own.From my perspective, staying in Paonia was either the best or the worst decisionthey ever made. I have often speculated about how differently our lives mighthave been had they stuck to their plan and settled in the Bay Area. Uponreflection, I’d say it was probably a lucky turn of events, because it allowedus to grow up where we did. The perspective of age has helped me appreciate whata special place Paonia was then, and still is, though in our youth both Terenceand I hated it and wanted nothing more than to escape, as eventually we did,each in our own way. Now I might consider expending almost equal effort to livethere again, though the practicalities of life make it quite unlikely that willever happen.One reason our parents suddenly decided to put down roots was tied to the factthat Mayme and her husband already had. Mayme, a homebody, was more timid andless adventurous than her older sister. After the business-training program inGrand Junction, she returned to Paonia and took a job at the Oliver CoalCompany. There she met a young coal miner named Joe Abseck from Somerset, asmall town just a few miles up the North Fork of the Gunnison River. Mayme keptan orderly house and an orderly life. During that era, women were supposed tofind fulfillment in raising kids and being good homemakers, and most men wouldhave been surprised if not offended to learn that a young housewife might havegreater ambitions. Yet my mother and her sisters were all smart women—smartenough, I suspect, to let their men think that as husbands they were in charge.By the time Mayme married Joe Abseck in 1934, he and Joe McKenna, my father,were fast friends. I suspect they bonded in part over getting to double date thetwo prettiest girls in Paonia. Doubtless many of the young men in town weredisappointed when Mayme became the first of the Kemp sisters to be taken out ofcirculation. In 1941, Joe Abseck moved to Ogden, Utah to work as aircraftinspector at Hill Field, now Hill Air Force Base; Mayme stayed on at the coalcompany. Their two daughters, identical twins, were born in September that year.Mayme and the girls joined Joe in Ogden in 1944; after the war they all returnedto Paonia—and stayed there.The trick was how to make a living in the rather narrow local economy. Joe andGeorge, his younger brother, decided to start an electrical appliance and repairbusiness. When my parents made their fateful stop, the Absecks urged my fatherto become their partner. The new venture made sense: construction was boomingacross the country as a wave of enlisted men returned, all looking to forget thewar, settle down, build a house, have a family, and live the American Dream. Formy parents, the prospect of a “normal” life in a quiet little Colorado town musthave won out over the lure of big-city excitement on the coast. My father signedon.Thus marked the founding of A&M Electric (as in Abseck and McKenna), the nameunder which the business thrived until it was sold decades later. My father,however, afflicted by perpetual restlessness, was by then long gone. After a fewyears at A&M, he cashed out and began working for a Denver company, CentralElectric Supply, as a sales rep in western Colorado and northern New Mexico. Hisposition at Central Electric, a mid-sized firm managed by a Jewish family,proved a better fit; he worked there until his retirement in 1972. It was thekind of job you could expect in those days, but not anymore—lifetime employment,modest but livable salary, a good pension. He was on the road every Monday,beyond the reach of the home office, and spent each weekend in Paonia with thelove of his life. Mom spoiled him outrageously; there was a chocolate cakewaiting for him every Friday, and steak and baked potatoes for dinner everySaturday. It was a point of pride with Dad that he could afford steak once aweek, and indeed times were good back then on his $20,000 a year.The good thing about the new job was that it didn’t tie him to a desk. Being inconstant motion appealed to our father, though it may have had adverseconsequences for the rest of us, given his five-day absence every week. After afew years, he got a small plane and covered his territory by air. This allowedhim to be home more. The plane also transformed one of the major stresses of hisjob, driving the mountain passes under treacherous conditions, to one of themajor pleasures of his life, flying the mountain passes under treacherousconditions. He didn’t mind that at all; in fact, I believe it was one of the fewtimes when he really felt free.Being a weekend father probably made putting up with his sons more tolerable, atleast for him. In later years, as we began pushing back against parentalconstraints, his absence undoubtedly changed the family dynamic in profoundways. His traveling was probably healthy for our parents’ marriage, however, inthat it kept them from ever tiring of each other. If “Terry and Denny” had neverhappened along, it might have been a perfect marriage.There is little doubt that our presence threw a wrench into their idyllicfifties fairy tale. Elder relatives have told me that kids were never part ofthe plan, or at least not part of our father’s. Our mother might have had otherideas and “pulled a fast one,” as one relative suggested, by getting pregnantwith Terence. After that, another fast one was almost inevitable, and four yearslater that led to me. Whether I was an accident or deliberately foisted on myunsuspecting father, I’m grateful for the outcome. Until her death in early 2012 at age ninety-seven, Aunt Mayme was the belovedmatriarch of an enormous and tight-knit brood of grandchildren,great-grandchildren, and great-great grandchildren, all of whom can be tracedback to her and her daughters, Jody and Judy. Both “the twins,” as we calledthem, married local boys and have lived in the area their entire lives. Thanksto them, I am blessed with a loving family of cousins, nieces, and nephews, andstill feel tied into the ancestral village where it all began. On my rarevisits, I am welcomed with love like the proverbial prodigal son, which Isuppose I am.I remember Mayme as a worrier, prone to fret over the littlest things. Snakesterrified her, as did thunderstorms. She’d read somewhere that she’d be safe ina car from lightning because cars were grounded. Accordingly, Mayme would get inher car and wait out storms in the garage. Her daughter Judy’s husband, Laddie,once joked that you could go into her refrigerator on any given day and reachfor the half-and-half without looking because it had been in exactly the sameplace for thirty years.When I was a kid, the twins were a trip, of course. Born in 1941, they wereteenagers by the mid-fifties, the early era of rock and roll—Buddy Holly, JamesDean, Elvis. That was the strange, surrealistic decade when the country, stillbenumbed by the trauma of the war, was yearning to rediscover some semblance ofnormalcy, either unaware or in denial of the forces that were gathering beneaththe surface, ready to burst into what American culture became in the sixties.But for the moment it was an innocent, if less than fully conscious, time.It must be exceedingly odd to be an “identical” twin, in that no one is reallyidentical even if they have exactly the same genes. In the fifties, that fatehad to be even more difficult, because society at the time placed such emphasison conformity, on fitting in.That left Judy and Jody not only genetically identical, but faced with theexpectation that they should be as identical as possible. They wore the sameclothes, listened to the same music, dated the same boys—until finally Judybroke the pattern and fell in with Laddie, a James Dean type and perhapsPaonia’s first existentialist. He looked and dressed the part of a juveniledelinquent: flattop hairstyle, low-cut jeans, leather jacket, and large-buckledbelt. It was all just an act. In reality he was something far more dangerous: abrooding, bookish intellectual, fond of reading Nietzsche and Heidegger, whokept such interests well concealed lest he reveal his true identity to his lessbrainy peers. Eventually Judy and Laddie married, and Laddie became thesuperintendent of schools in Delta County. He had radical ideas about education,which is to say, he sought to change a local system that in the past had stifledcuriosity and the desire to learn. His reforms led to a remarkable crop ofwell-educated students who actually knew how to think. Unfortunately, all thathappened in the eighties and nineties, long after Terence and I had a chance tobenefit from the changes. But Laddie was a big influence on us in subtler ways.He was one of the few people in our youth who could actually hold his own withTerence, and in fact could beat him in most arguments. I think Terence was alittle afraid of him, because he knew Laddie saw right through him. He remainsone of the smartest and most perceptive people I’ve ever known.Our mother’s youngest sister, Tress, was destined to affect our lives as well.Like Mayme, she started at Paonia High a year early; the fact that one of herhalf-sisters was married to the town’s venerated football coach may have helpedher pull some strings. After she graduated in 1938, Tress did not attendbusiness college like her sisters; instead she moved to Delta and spent thesummer with Hadie and Joe, my parents. She had earned a scholarship at theUniversity of Colorado, if I recall, but couldn’t afford the other expenses.That fall she moved to Glendale, California and enrolled in junior college whileliving with her half-brother John—the oldest son of her father’s firstfamily—and John’s wife. After the school year ended in 1939, she and aclassmate, Ray Somers, eloped to Tijuana, where the going price for a weddingring at the time was ten cents. Tress and Ray had a “proper” ceremony later thatyear (and remained married until Ray’s death in 1982). They briefly returned toPaonia, where their son, Grant, was born in 1940, followed by their daughterCarolyn in 1944. Kathi, born in June 1947, was the closest in age to Terence.After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Somers moved back to Glendale, and Ray gota job building Liberty Ships—a profession apparently open to young men as thewar effort mounted. I mentioned how our father found such work in the Bay Area,as did one of his brothers. Ray’s stint in the Los Angeles shipyards lasteduntil 1944, when he reported to Fort Ord near Monterey for basic training. Hefigured he’d soon be on his way to Japan, but the war ended before then. In1946, he landed his first teaching job, in Glendale, at a salary of $2,400 ayear. Tress also got her teaching certificate, and the family moved north toMountain View, California, where they both taught school until they retired inthe late sixties. Terence lived for a time with the Somers during his teens,with rather unhappy results—an episode I’ll revisit later.Despite her West Coast life, Tress’s ties to Colorado remained strong. In 1952,the couple bought a spread in the Crystal River Valley, just across McClure Passfrom Paonia, and operated it as a dude ranch during the summers. They continuedteaching in California in the offseason, except for a winter in the mid-fiftieswhen they stayed at the ranch so the kids could experience a cold and snowyColorado winter with no electricity and only a wood stove for heat.Chair Mountain Ranch—“the ranch” to us—figured large in our childhood. Dad wasan avid fisherman, and the Crystal River was known for its excellent troutfishing. Mom and Tress were close, so we ended up spending almost every summerweekend at the ranch. Mom, Terry, and I would leave on Thursday night or earlyFriday morning, braving the treacherous ride over McClure Pass in our Chevycoupe. It was a scary drive back then, switchbacks and gravel all the way,except when the road turned to mud in the rain. Dad would come off his weeklytravels on Fridays and meet us there, and we’d have the most idyllic weekends.Dad got his fishing in, and we’d hang out with our three cousins. During thedude-ranch years, there were horses to ride by day and campfires at night,complete with roasted marshmallows, stories, and games of charades.Our cousin Grant was good on a guitar and seemed to know all the old folk songs.I was especially fond of “Wreck on the Highway,” a tune made popular by thecountry star Roy Acuff in the early forties. “There was whiskey and blood alltogether,” one verse began, “mixed with glass they lay; death played her hand indestruction, but I didn’t hear nobody pray.” The images were just grisly andgraphic enough to appeal to me as a seven-year-old. But as a good Catholic boyat the time, I wasn’t deaf to its stark warning about what happened to those whodrank too much, drove too fast, and didn’t pray. Although not usuallycharacterized as such, that song was the first I’d ever heard about the dangersof drug abuse—in this case alcohol—and I took it to heart. A decade later, I hada similar reaction to the lyrics of “Heroin,” the famous song by VelvetUnderground. I have never tried heroin in my life, and have never wanted to.Hearing that song as a teenager probably helped me avoid getting tied up withone of the more harmful and dangerous recreational drugs. On the other hand, Igot very involved with the psychedelics and cannabis, perhaps encouraged by theseductive lyrics of songs like “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,” “Mr. TambourineMan,” “White Rabbit,” and so on. The moralists have leveled much criticism atrock lyrics that extol drugs, and I suppose they have a point. But for me,“Heroin,” at least, was a distinct disincentive and probably prevented me fromgoing down a path that is better left untraveled.Not all the songs my cousin Grant played were so grim, of course, and thosesummer nights beside the fire, like so many other moments at Chair MountainRanch, are boyhood memories I cherish. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 3 - Roots and Wars [images/00033.jpg]> Left to right: grandmother Molly McKenna, Terence, father Joe McKenna, Dennis> with Skelly, and grandfather Joseph McKenna. Writing about our father’s family is problematic, partly because I know solittle about them. Writing about our father himself is even harder, given thathe was always a bit of a cipher, and remains so to this day. More to the point,it’s hard to discuss a person who had so much influence on us, and yet with whomwe were so frequently in conflict. In a fragmentary memoir, his younger brotherAustin remembers Dad as an Irish storyteller who saw the humor in everything andcould confabulate with the best of them. His wild accounts were usually wellworn, if never told the same way twice. Mom would often call him out: “Oh, Joe,”she’d say, “you’re exaggerating; it didn’t happen like that at all.” And he’dlook hurt and pretend to protest, but with a twinkle in his eye. He wasbullshitting, and he knew it, and he knew you knew it, but the tale was so goodit didn’t matter. Terence inherited his father’s talent, or flaw, for neverletting facts get in the way of a good story. That partly explains why, inlooking back, I haven’t always been sure where the yarn spinning ends and thefamily history begins.I do know my father was born high—almost two miles high, in Leadville, Colorado,on September 23, 1915. He had an older sister, Amelia, and two younger brothers:Ed, and Austin, the youngest, now nearing ninety and the only sibling stillalive. Their parents, Joseph and Mary, who went by Molly, were both IrishCatholics. Over the years, both my Uncle Austin and Aunt Amelia described theirfamily as tight-knit and affectionate; they clearly treasured their childhoodmemories and praised their parents for filling their household with a sense ofsecurity and love. I have the impression my paternal grandparents had permissiveideas about childrearing compared to the norms of their day.When my father was eight or nine, the family moved sixty miles south, and a fewthousand feet downhill, to Salida. My grandfather worked in a Crews-Beggsdepartment store, one of several such branches in southern Colorado at the time.His brother, Patrick, also lived in Salida with his wife. Their sister, Mary,moved to Aspen and raised three children. Having met her once when I was veryyoung, I remember little except my amazement that a person could be so old.My great-grandfather was one John McKenna, a miner, who may also have used thesurname McKinney or McKenney at times. He apparently married a woman who ran aboardinghouse; they definitely had a son—Joseph, my grandfather. The coupleeventually separated, and John returned to Ireland, where rumor had it heremarried. His former partner, her name now lost, remarried as well; she thenmay have been widowed and married again. The actual kinship ties between mygrandfather and his siblings, known and unknown, are thus unclear.According to one account, our great-grandfather had a brother, Patrick, who wasone of the first prospectors in Leadville and Aspen back when the silver boombegan in 1879. The two McKennas supposedly filed claims for sites around Aspen,according to my Uncle Austin, who had seen documents to that effect; butwhatever they made was “lost to drink and poker,” or so their ancient sisteronce recalled. Dad used to say that his great-uncle had once been offered thecentral city blocks of Aspen in exchange for a map to his grubstake mine on theflanks of Aspen Mountain. It’s nice to think the family came “that close” toowning a chunk of what is now some of the most valuable real estate on theplanet, but then again, our father’s stories had a reputation for beingnotoriously inaccurate.I’m not sure how our paternal grandparents met. Our father’s mother, Molly, wassecond-generation Irish; her ancestors had moved to America during Ireland’sgreat potato famine, around 1850. She was born in Denver, one of four siblingsresulting from the marriage of Fred Hazeltine, a Pennsylvania mining engineer,and the former Sarah Quinn. At some point, Molly moved back to Pennsylvania tocare for her mother’s disabled sister. There she met a second aunt, LizzieQuinn, a Roman Catholic nun who went by the name of Sister Mary Amelia, whothought her bright young niece deserved a high school education. Thanks to heraunt, Molly found herself in Kansas living at an academy run by the Sisters ofCharity of Leavenworth, a Catholic order founded in 1858 by the members of aconvent in Nashville.Molly’s stay there would be the middle chapter in the family’s three-generationinvolvement with that organization. Our dad’s sister Amelia was named after theaunt who had done so much to help her mother. A bookish child, Amelia wasconsidered the intellectual of the family. Eventually, she too became a nun withthe Sisters of Charity. It was a natural progression. Career opportunities forbrainy, ambitious women were limited then, and joining a convent thatadministered both schools and hospitals was a way to escape the era’sconventional expectations. Our Aunt Amelia, known as Sister Rose Carmel, tookfull advantage of her opportunities at the convent, and her family connectionsto it, and remained in the order for the rest of her life. She eventually earnedthe equivalent of a Ph.D. in chemistry, taught for years in Leavenworth, andlater became a pastoral counselor in several of the hospitals administered bythe order, in Denver, Santa Monica, California, and Helena, Montana.Aunt Amelia and Terence had similar personalities and much in common, which isprobably why they never got along (or, more precisely, why Terence never gotalong with her). Both were brilliant, headstrong, and rebellious. Amelia mighthave been a nun, but she was anything but meek and mild. She was a rabble-rouserand a troublemaker, questioning many tenets of dogma and accepted practices thatwere intended to keep nuns in their place. In later years, Amelia developedstrong opinions regarding the exclusion of women from the priesthood, and waseven heard to voice certain unflattering observations about the pope, much tothe chagrin of her more timid colleagues. As a teacher, she was terrifying; manyof her students relate stories of how they lived in fear of her wrath, but manyof these same students recalled her tough love with affection and respect. Sheloved her students, but she brooked no bullshit and expected them to meet herhigh expectations.She brought the same approach to her dealings with Terence and managed toinfuriate him regularly. Terence was always a smooth talker and a skilledbullshitter; there was an unspoken assumption in our family that Terence wassmarter than any of us, including me. This, combined with his gift of gab,enabled him to make many provocative statements that went unchallenged. Terenceloved nothing more than to shock people, a trait that later served him well as apublic figure. The shock-resistant Amelia would have none of it. She was everybit as smart as Terence, she was as well or better read, she was unflappable,and that drove Terence nuts. Though she lived her adult life as a nun, she readwidely and was actually one of the most open-minded people I have ever known.There was nothing that she could not or would not discuss. It was quiteremarkable, really. Terence resented this, or claimed to; he didn’t like to bechallenged, and he was so smooth that he could pull the wool over most anyone’seyes. Amelia saw through all this and managed to get under his skin on a regularbasis.Though Terence would never admit it, I think eventually he came to respectAmelia as a worthy sparring partner. There is no doubt of Amelia’s affection forTerence; she was there for him at every important twist of his life, includingthe terrible summer of 1999, my brother’s last, a good part of which Amelia andI spent with him in Hawaii. Our beloved aunt, Sister Rose, the “old battle-ax”in Terence’s words, outlived him by three years. She died at age ninety in 2003at her convent, surrounded by family and friends. There was more of Amelia inTerence than he would ever admit. She cut a wide swath, and, like Terence, therewill never be another like her.I have different recollections of our father’s brothers, Ed and Austin. Iremember Ed chiefly because he had a large family of eight kids. As a young man,he attended various colleges in Colorado and then went to engineering school inOakland, where he lived near Lake Merritt in the same apartment building as myparents. Following school, he left to work on the construction of the AlaskaHighway during the War. He’d been barred from the military, classified as 4-Fbecause of a heart leakage. The Al-Can project, as Canadians called it, wasconsidered essential for national defense, and so he served that way. He utterlyignored the advice of his doctors to take it easy in light of his heartcondition; he loved hunting and fishing, played hard, worked at hard jobs likelaying track, and drank like a fish. After the war, he ended up with ahigh-pressure job in Seattle as a sales manager for a belt and pulley company.According to a new coinage at the time, he was a “Type A” personality. He wasvery strict with his kids and always seemed to be simmering with barelysuppressed anger. Or so I gathered on the few occasions when we spent any timewith him or his family. Accordingly, I made no effort to get to know him,preferring to stay out of his way.As for Austin—Uncle Aut, as I call him—I became better acquainted with myfather’s youngest brother later in life. Like his sister Amelia, Aut was smartand had a rebellious streak, but as a man he had more choices when it came toescaping the constraints of convention. Before the war, he started art school inSan Francisco and became the bohemian of the family. He lived in a boardinghousein Pacific Heights and earned his keep by helping the landlady with cooking andcleaning. Some of his roommates were fellow artists, others led different lives,but most were characters of one kind or another. Among his colorful housemateswere at least two gay couples, his first encounter with gays—a real educationfor a small-town boy, and a step toward developing an unusual sense of tolerancethat defines him to this day.For a short while there, around the start of the war, all three brothers livedin the Bay Area. Aut’s brief memoirs suggest they regularly got together onweekends and did their share of partying. Our parents and uncles were notprudes. Dinners and ballroom dancing were favorite pastimes during the swing erawith its famous big band leaders and singers, from Tommy Dorsey and Guy Lombardoto Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald. The McKennas clearly enjoyed theirdrinking, but they weren’t lushes. Had they been young adults thirty yearslater, I’m sure they would have been passing joints, dropping acid, and going tosee the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane just as we did.Once the war began, Aut’s boardinghouse days came to an end. He moved toBerkeley and, like our father, worked for a while in the Kaiser shipyards.Having registered for duty shortly after Pearl Harbor, he was biding his time.Through a lucky break, he got a job at a mine back home, not far from Salida. Itwas another “essential” defense-related job, mining fluorspar, a mineral used insteel manufacturing. Meanwhile, he waited to be called; like most everyone elsein those days, he wanted to serve.Eventually inducted at Fort Logan in Denver, he endured basic training inMissouri, which nearly killed him, he admitted, and got assigned to atopographic battalion in West Virginia. He caught another break when it came tolight that he was an excellent skier, a sport he’d pursued as a kid. The armywas then forming a mountain battalion modeled after the Finnish ski units thathelped to slow a Soviet invasion of Finland launched in 1939. Aut was able toleverage his knowledge of skiing and cartography into a transfer to the TenthMountain Division, which became famous for its exploits in defeating the Germantroops in the Apennines of northern Italy in 1945. His wartime experiences hadan enormous impact on his life. Over the decades, he kept in touch with hisbuddies from that era and treasured their friendship. For a person like me whohas never been in war, it’s almost impossible to understand how important thoseexperiences were for him.All this happened well before Terence and I were born, at a time when settlingdown to have a family was the last thing on the minds of these young men. Thewar abruptly severed them from the past and profoundly altered their futures, tothe point where what they began afterward were virtually second lives. Thingswere never the same again.Aut returned and married his first wife, Mary Lou, in 1948. They settled inDenver, where Aut ran the graphics department at a local ad agency—a stressfuljob, like his brother Ed’s. On our rare visits he seemed grumpy andshort-tempered, at least to my eight-year-old sensibilities. He probably wouldhave been quite happy teaching art in a small college; but the pressures ofearning enough to support his three adopted children and achieve the postwarAmerican Dream led him to pursue what was perhaps a less satisfying career inmanagement at various companies.Aut’s first wife, Mary Lou, died of cancer in 1976. Eleven years later heremarried and retired to Hawaii, beginning what might be called his third life.Following Terence’s move to Hawaii in the early nineties, I traveled therefairly often to see him, trips that grew more frequent after Terence learned ofhis illness in 1999. I’ve continued to visit Hawaii at least once a year toteach courses, often visiting Aut, whom I know much better now than I did as aboy. He’s a great guy, one of the most open-minded and mellow people I know. Authas forged a new identity as a local artist of some renown in Kona, and abeloved figure in the local arts scene, where he’s known as Mac. He and his wifeFran are, to me, exemplars of what it means to be elderly, vibrant, and engaged,both locally and, through the Internet and television, with the rest of theworld. They are living proof that misery and loss of cognitive functions aren’tinevitable with age. The rest of us should be so lucky. I’ve talked about our mother and her family, and our father’s family as well;let me try to address the enigmatic figure of our father, Joe. According to Aut,our dad grew up reading adventure novels and longing for a glamorous life.Again, as with his storytelling, I detect shades of the father in his sons. Hemissed out on a lot of active life as a boy, being rather sickly. When he waseleven or twelve, he contracted a severe case of rheumatic fever following anepisode of strep throat. In the mid-1920s, there were no antibiotics, and hisprolonged illness kept him out of school and bedridden for months at a stretch.Although he eventually recovered and led a normal life, the residual damage tohis heart caught up with him in his early sixties when surgeons replaced hisleaky heart valve with a pig’s.His long childhood convalescence may have been a blessing in disguise. For onething, it left him more bookish than many of his peers. Though our father neverhad the benefit of a college education, he had a lifelong passion for reading.During his illness he discovered the novels of Zane Grey, which he loved. Healso devoured a lot of early science fiction, a genre that, thanks to him, had ahuge impact on Terence and me. His favorites included the works of Edgar RiceBurroughs, especially the Tarzan and Barsoom books, the latter set amid a doomedcivilization on Mars; and the early Tom Swift novels, a series created by EdwardStratemeyer in 1910. In my preteens, I became similarly enamored of a secondseries that began in 1954 and featured Tom Swift, Jr., the elder Swift’sbrilliant son. The closest analog to Tom Swift, Jr. in pop culture today may beTony Stark, the hero of the popular Iron Man movies starring Robert Downey, Jr.Stark is smart, technically savvy, rebellious, handsome, and sexy, with oodlesof money and plenty of cool toys, not to mention babes. The Swift series putless emphasis on girls, but their heroes represented the same fantasy ideal forour father and me that Stark surely does for young males today.After consuming all those pulp adventure novels, it’s little wonder that ourfather, his health restored, left Salida shortly after high school in 1933 toseek his fortune. That quest took him to Delta, where, as mentioned, he soldshoes and fell for an older woman, two years older, my mother, Hadie Kemp. Hewas twenty-two when they married in 1937. Seven years later, he’d find himselfin a B-17 flying missions aimed at crippling the Nazi’s industrial base.Our father never talked much about his experiences during the war. His reticencestemmed from the fact that his combat experiences were traumatic, as they werefor many soldiers; the horrors of war would shadow my father for the rest of hislife. No wonder he was reluctant to discuss events that must have seemed bestforgotten. During the 1950s, he developed vitiligo, a skin disease he describedas an “allergy to sunlight.” He always wore large hats and long-sleeved shirtsto minimize his exposure to the sun, which for an outdoorsman was a majorinconvenience. His skin became mottled with large white patches amid normallypigmented skin, and sunlight would exacerbate this condition. Vitiligo struck meas mysterious at the time, but a minute’s research on the Internet reveals awealth of information about this autoimmune disorder. Its exact mechanismsremain unclear, but some say that stress and trauma may be triggering factors.He may have had a genetic predisposition to the condition that his wartimeordeal activated. As the decade wore on, his symptoms gradually faded.What didn’t fade, however, was his new determination to seek “normalcy” at anycost. After the war, he seemed to retreat from his former devil-may-carepersona. He still loved adventure novels, but he wanted only to settle down andlive quietly. In this respect he was not alone. The craving for stability wascommon among his generation, and especially among those who had fought in thewar. The goal was not to stand out too much.On the cultural level this found expression in The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit,the 1955 novel by Sloan Wilson that later became a movie. The story chroniclesthe postwar experiences of Tom Rath and his wife Betsy as they struggle to findhappiness in a material world bereft of spiritual meaning. I don’t know if ourfather was familiar with either version, let alone whether the story spoke tohim. I rather doubt it, though I’m pretty sure our mother read the book. I doknow my father’s war experiences deeply influenced him and, in turn, hisrelationships with Terence and me. He viewed himself as an average guy, andthat’s what he wanted to be—just one of the herd. This rather unappealingarchetype was held up to Terence and me as an ideal throughout the 1960s andsparked many an argument. The last thing we wanted to be was average or normal.In fact, the counterculture was a reaction against that ideal. Like others inour generation, we were busy rebelling against the conformity that had stifledcreativity after the war. We wanted to celebrate our individuality. We wanted tobe unique, creative, one of a kind. Average was boring; boring was death.But average is a statistical fiction; there is no such thing. The irony is thatthere was nothing average about our father. He was unique in so many ways—waysthat directly influenced who his sons grew up to be. For reasons that remainunclear to me, he chose not to take advantage of the GI Bill, the 1944 law thatguaranteed college tuition for veterans. Being a few years older than theaverage returning soldier, he may have felt that he’d seen and survived too muchto resume student life (which never particularly appealed to him). Nevertheless,he continued to learn. A pilot, a woodsman, a lifelong reader, an avid followerof popular science and science fiction, he was an interesting person, and yet aperson determined to hide his light under the cloak of normalcy, almost asthough he was afraid his friends might discover he wasn’t the good conformistthey thought he was. This self-deprecating attitude, this denial even to himselfof his uniqueness, drove Terence and me up the wall. We had many fiercearguments about it, arguments that only hardened positions on both sides,reinforcing our determination never to be average guys, and never, ever, to belike our father.I now have more perspective on how history, largely in the form of war, left itsmark on all of us. My parents came of age in an era dominated by World War II,and the looming specter of global conflict, followed by its horrific reality,had a lasting impact on how their lives unfolded. But after Pearl Harbor andHitler’s invasions of Poland and France, it was clearly a just war, a “good” wartheir generation had to fight. If you were able-bodied, you enlisted; it was theright thing to do. You rearranged your plans and made the sacrifices that mosteveryone else was making in order to save what amounted to human civilization.The young had little choice but to put their private dreams on hold until thishorrific bit of geopolitical business had been dealt with. That imperativelimited the options that were available to my parents and their contemporaries,even as it shaped their enduring attitudes and worldviews.I sometimes wonder if, in our father’s situation, I would have had the courageto enlist. I suppose I would have; peer pressure alone would have made it toughto do otherwise. There was an anti-war movement during World War II, but it wassmall, and our parents surely had nothing to do with it. The prevailing view wasthat the war had to be fought, a view I share.My generation was also deeply affected by war, but in very different ways. Ourwar, in Vietnam, was shot through with moral ambiguity, a war this country hadno clear need or justification to fight. It seemed to be a grim game played withthe lives of young Americans (not to mention untold numbers of Vietnamese) whowere asked (and ordered, via the draft) to serve a cause whose rationale wasmurky indeed, lost in the obfuscations and double-talk of war-mongeringgenerals, breast-beating super-patriots and mealy-mouthed politicians. Withtime, a moral imperative to the war did emerge, and the imperative was: Don’tgo. Resist. Tell the government and the politicians to take their war and shoveit. And that’s what a lot of us did.Certainly that’s what Terence and I did. Like many of our peers, we’d had ourminds blown with LSD and had bought into the hippy-dippy, peace-and-love,counterculture paradigm. Naturally, this trend shocked and appalled many in ourparents’ generation, as did the disrespect for authority that resistance to thewar necessitated. In my opinion, the Vietnam War and the widespread use of LSDwere the two events that contributed most to the ideological and culturaldivisions that ripped apart the country in the sixties. Those wounds remain openeven today, a time when any form of healing, of tolerance for diverse moral andethical perspectives, seems more remote than ever. Fortunately, Terence and Idid not have to confront the full force of those conflicts at home. Yes, ourparents looked harshly on hippies and the counterculture; they hated and fearedLSD and other such drugs, along with the demagogues like Timothy Leary whopromoted them. But they also knew the war was an unwarranted and unnecessarytravesty. They didn’t encourage us to protest in the streets (we did anyway),but they did strive to keep us in school so we’d qualify for student deferments.Like many others, my brother and I could avoid the war by graduating from highschool and getting into college. That we succeeded can be traced back to theearly emphasis our parents placed on books and reading. When they were kids,higher education was still hard to come by; it was seen as a privilege, the keyto a better life and career that not everyone could hope to achieve. Though ourfather decided not to attend college, both our parents were determined that wewould. I’m eternally grateful that they passed on a love of learning to us. Wedidn’t have the sense to realize it at the time, let alone to appreciate howhard they worked to keep us in school while our less fortunate peers were tappedfor sacrifice to the god of war. Now, of course, I do appreciate it—now thatit’s too late to thank them. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 4 - Terry and Denny [images/00037.jpg][images/00001.jpg]> Terence Kemp McKenna and Dennis Jon McKenna. Terence Kemp McKenna emerged from his mother’s womb on November 16, 1946. It wasthe end of a difficult pregnancy. My twin cousins assure me that my brother wasa challenge from an early age and quickly earned the appellation “TerribleTerry.” Many infants and toddlers try the patience of their parents, butTerence, a “temperamental” child in modern parlance, apparently pushed ours tothe limit. Fortunately, Mom had her sisters to help her through these tryingepisodes. Their support throughout our childhood was surely a major reason sheremained as sane as she did. In fact, our mother was wise and compassionate, andif anything too tolerant. I know we hurt her, profoundly and deeply, many times;and many times in the four decades since her death I have wanted to apologize. Ihave to believe she knew we loved her despite it all. I suppose this lament isno different from that of any mother’s son. How many of us really honor andappreciate our mothers the way we should? Yet they always forgive us. In myheart, I believe our mother knew we loved her and has forgiven us.Some time after Terry was born, the little family moved out of our mother’schildhood home to an upstairs apartment in a house near the Bross Hotel (then asnow Paonia’s only hotel). They had just settled into their newly built home atFourth and Orchard when I arrived, on a cold December day in 1950, a week beforeChristmas. I have no idea if I was “planned” or not, but whatever the case, whenI joined the family my parents were delighted. Compared to Terry, I was a modelof mellowness, or what some would call a “placid” baby. Though I’m still evenlytempered, certain critics, notably my wife, tell me I’m not as laid back as Ilike to pretend. Whatever. Compared to Terry, raising me was easy for myparents—at least early on.Terence was a month past his fourth birthday when I showed up. Until then, he’dbeen the master of his universe, getting all the attention he craved. Like mostany child, he perceived my arrival as a threat to his hegemony, which it was,and for years his primary agenda would be to neutralize this threat by anymeans. Had I been the elder sibling when he burst into my sweet scene in all hismewling, puking, disgusting glory, I’m sure I would have done the same. I daresay this was probably normal sibling behavior, at least in American society inthe fifties. The difference was that Terry, being smart and creative, tookbrotherly terrorism to some rather interesting places. I see this as a very goodreason not to have more than one child, or, if you do, to time them closertogether or much farther apart. Four years strike me as exactly the wrongspacing.There’s another factor that complicates my attempt at an early psychologicalportrait of Terence. At some point shortly before I was born, when Terence wasthree or four, there was an incident that drove a wedge between him and ourfather, changing their relationship forever. Indeed, the moment may havenegatively affected Terence’s relationships until the end of his life. Accordingto what Terence told me decades later, he and a friend were playing in asandbox; being curious, and being boys, they began playing with each other’sgenitals, and, somehow, handling each other’s shit. From a modern perspective,this behavior would be considered totally within the bounds of normality forkids that age, and most parents today would laugh it off. But when our dadencountered the scene he apparently freaked out. All his repressed fears abouthomosexuality, and sexuality in general, instilled in him as a Catholic child,bubbled up in a blind rage, and he spanked Terence rather badly for thistransgression. In a way, he was exorcising his own demons from these forbiddenrealms; the outburst might have been directed at his son, but I am sure it roseout of his own fears.Terence could not have understood that; all he knew was that his dad hadsuddenly turned on him in a vicious and painful way and beaten the livingdaylights out of him. His response, understandably, was one of rage andresentment. He couldn’t really show his extreme anger without risk of anotherbeating; but the resentment soaked in, and lingered forever.“That was it,” Terence said when he told me the story. “That was it between us.”He slammed an emotional door on our father that was never to be reopened, or soI believe; in that one instant, he resolved to protect himself at any cost, tonever show vulnerability, and to put his own (perceived) self-interests frontand center at all times. It would seem that, in his own mind, his mistreatmentjustified his extreme hostility over the years toward our parents, especiallyour father, and also toward me. As Terence matured he got better atrelationships, but they were never easy for him. He told me this story withgreat vehemence and as if it had happened yesterday. I am left wondering if thisexperience had resulted in a loss of some essential willingness to trust inothers. The story explained my experience of an emotional firewall that I oftenencountered at the core our relationship, and what I could perceive of hisrelationships with others. As for me, he eventually discovered that I wasn’tjust a younger, weaker brother to torture. He did express his love for me, butonly after years of abuse.I don’t remember when Terry instituted his reign of terror against me, but itmust have been when I was about four or five. Terry was a very creativetormentor, and employed both physical techniques and, even deadlier, a varietyof psychological techniques to good effect. For physical torture, tickling washis method of choice. It was a good choice; I was very ticklish, probably inpart because I became over-sensitized to it during our torture sessions. But itworked for Terry because it didn’t leave marks, and superficially it didn’t seem“that bad” because it made me laugh; but the laughter was not voluntary orenjoyable.Terry was bigger than me, obviously. His favorite method was to hold me down onthe floor, placing a knee on my chest and using both hands to pin my arms, thenusing his sharpened chin to poke and prod me. This became known as the “chin-ee”method. Other techniques were applied as well, but it was the chin-ee that Ihated the most. It was all good-natured fun—for Terry. I don’t think he intendedto hurt me, at least not with his tickling; but the impulse was hard to resist,because I so reliably reacted in a satisfying way. On other occasions thetorture was more overt and I ended up bawling a lot. Perhaps nothing about thiswas abnormal; siblings compete, a primate pecking order must be established,this is just what humans do. Like most big brothers, I suspect, Terry both hatedand loved the little squirmy worm that I was. It was fine for him to torture me,he considered it a perquisite of being the big brother; but if anyone elsethreatened me, he was there to protect me.If the physical teasing I endured was mundane and run-of-the-mill, thepsychological teasing reached another level. Terry consistently tried to createa climate of fear based on unpredictability. His mischief had to be done underthe radar, of course, without drawing my parents’ attention. My reality was oneof whispered innuendoes and muttered threats about what would happen the instantthey turned their backs: dire consequences awaited me if I failed to toe theline. What was the line? Well, it was nothing less than total subjugation.Often, Terry would thrust his face into mine and rasp, in a low whisper, whilestaring at me with a hypnotic gaze: “Never oppose my will. Never, ever oppose mywill!” I hated this and didn’t react submissively. On the occasions when I daredto express actual defiance, however, his responses got physical, and more oftenthan not I’d end up crying.I was not always the innocent victim, of course, though I got very skilled atplaying one. Like many little brothers before me, I developed offensivecountermeasures as well as defenses. My offensives had to be stealthy. Icultivated the art of timing. I became skilled at selecting, or creating,situations in which it appeared that Terry had done something to me, but hadn’treally (or in which I was complicit), and I’d make sure our parents noticed.While presenting a picture of angelic innocence to them, I’d telegraph Terry,via a smirk, that this was sweet revenge. Blame and sometimes punishment wouldthen follow, all the more resented by him because it was unjustified. I knewthat sooner or later there would be retribution, but I didn’t care. Knowing thatI’d managed to stick it to him for a change was extremely satisfying.What was driving Terry? By the time I showed up, his encounter with our fatherwas in the past, but I’m sure it still stung. In what must have been a strategyfor survival, he had hardened his emotional armor and adopted the “me-first”attitude that persisted well into his adult life. I don’t think he had everharbored the hatred for our mother that he did for our father. Part of it was,he had learned to trust her as someone who would protect him from Dad—which shedid many, many times. She was kind and nurturing and perhaps just a littleafraid of her husband. Over the years, she often refrained from telling himabout the horrible things “the boys” had been up to in his absence, perhapsfearing he’d overreact in some regrettable way that could not easily be undone.To be fair, our father physically punished us only on the rarest of occasionsthat even today some parents might view as deserving such a response. Thoseinstances tended to occur on Friday nights after Dad returned from a hard weekon the road, only to find we’d been busy in his absence driving our mothercrazy. That’s when the belt would come off and we’d get a thrashing. I must alsoadd that never once did I see our father lay a hand on our mother in anger. Inour family, that was a line that was never crossed.Having re-read what I’ve written above, I have to ask myself: are these things Ishould share with the world? Do others really need to know the intimate detailsof our early lives? If I am to tell an honest tale, the answer is yes. We grewup in small-town Leave It to Beaver, Father Knows Best America. But there was adarkness hidden beneath that portrayal of middle-class life, as many others whogrew up in that era are surely aware. Certain unconscious emotions erupted allthe more violently when, in the sixties, the layer of “niceness” was ripped awayto reveal the wounds still festering underneath.So yeah, a lot about that era was ugly and unacknowledged at the time, in ourfamily, and perhaps in most families. Each had its dark secrets, and ours werenot particularly that horrible by comparison. Just so I don’t give the wrongimpression, let me stress that much—much—about our life together was very goodindeed, even if as kids we didn’t always realize it. I know our parents lovedus. They did the best they could in raising two difficult and recalcitrant boys.It took decades, but Terence eventually overcame much of his animosity towardour father. He certainly found a kind of love for our mother, which I saw mostvividly in the kindness and solicitude he showed her when years later shedeveloped cancer. As we grew up and overcame our sibling rivalries, we developeda mutual sense of affection and respect, and I’m grateful for that. Later, ourcloseness allowed us to experience some of the strangest adventures two brothershave ever shared. Had we not grown up in the twisted climate of the fifties, sorife with angst and neuroticism, we might never have forged the strong bondsthat became the Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss. What are your earliest childhood memories? How far back can you cast your mind?Recollecting childhood can be a tricky exercise, because the earliest memoriesare pre-linguistic; there is no cognitive framework within which they can beplaced. Mine are mostly gestalt impressions: my father’s rough, stubbly cheekwhen he kissed me, contrasted with my mother’s smooth skin when she held me toher breast (though I’m pretty sure I was never actually breastfed—it just wasn’twhat “modern” mothers did in those days, and Mom wanted to be modern). The eyes,the breath, the smell of various adults; the icy sting on my face on a crisp,cold morning, or the warm caress of sunshine on a summer afternoon. These vaguerecollections are entirely sensual and without context. It’s been said that wecan’t recall anything earlier than about the age of three or four; othersdispute this and assert that one can have memories from a time as early astwo—mostly visual snapshots without narrative or structure. Based on my ownvague memories, I’d have to go with the latter hypothesis. A recent Harvardstudy suggests that recalling childhood memories can make one more helpful andcharitable, increasing “prosocial” behavior tied to recollections of a time whenthings were morally clear and pure. Based on my own experiences, I take thatwith a grain of salt. I have no doubt that childhood memories can stick with onethroughout life. If they are good memories, they have a positive influence; ifthey are bad—memories of trauma, for example—they can be quite profound and evenlimiting. In my familial universe, Terence’s memories of the sandbox incidentwould be Exhibit A.Among the most curious of my earliest remembrances are those that may not bereal. I mentioned that our parents left their apartment and moved into their newhome shortly before my birth. And yet I have a vague memory of Terence pushingme down those apartment stairs. It’s certainly a traumatic memory, but did itreally happen? I have no idea. Maybe it happened to someone else and I falselyremember the experience as mine. Or perhaps I dreamt it. I have a similarrecollection of my mother leaving me in her Chevy with the motor running outsideher father’s house when I was three or even younger. Though I do believe sheactually did this—foolishly, in that era before car seats and seat belts—myapparent memory of the event may actually have been a dream. I “remember” thecar rolling slowly down the street a short way until it halted against a curb,my mother by then standing beside it in hysterics. But I’m not sure that partactually happened. To this day I sometimes dream I’m driving in a car, then lookdown to see there’s no steering wheel, or the steering wheel has come loose inmy hands. The issue? Probably losing control, my wife would say. My “memory” ofbeing trapped in the runaway Chevy was perhaps just an early instance ofgrappling with that in my sleep.My earliest reliable memories date from when I was four. By then, Terence wasoften at school for much of the day, giving me a welcome respite from histortures. That comfort with solitude has persisted throughout my life. I enjoybeing alone with nothing but the whisper of my thoughts. And besides, back thenI wasn’t alone. I had a whole gaggle of imaginary friends, some of them as realto me as my actual friends, of which I then had few. (With no kindergarten inPaonia, my socializing didn’t really begin until first grade.) I preferredhanging out with my imaginary friends because they were always there and moreinteresting. Some were even animals; how cool is that? We’d cross the street tothe city park or, more accurately, I’d go to the park and “manifest” them, as ifthey were always there, waiting to play. And play we did! I created all sorts ofadventures to share with them, performing all the roles and voices. As a child Ihad a very active dream life. In fact I’m not sure I ever really slept in theconventional sense. Or maybe I was in a constant state of high REM sleep, alwaysdreaming. My imaginary friends were also available in my dreams, where ourlittle dramas often continued. It was tremendously entertaining and fun, but onesad day I dismissed them, just bade them goodbye. It was all very formal. “OK,I’m moving on, you’re not going to see me again,” I informed them, and they werequite dismayed. But it had to be done. Time to move on. I could not have beenmore than eight.Though manifesting various identities or personalities may be a disorder inadults, I agree with those who view such behavior as normal in young children. Achild’s personality, or what eventually becomes his or her personality,condenses and coalesces out of a multitude. When it fails to do that, then youhave pathology. Reflecting on this, I have to wonder about the similaritiesbetween the consciousness of a child and the consciousness of an indigenousperson. To a child, these imaginary entities are real, as real as anything inthe so-called “real” world. It must be much the same for an indigenous personwho inhabits a world of spirits, of human and non-human entities, where thedistinctions between dreams and reality are not so clear. I do not mean to implythat an indigenous person is childish, but rather that indigenous people andchildren may share some traits in their mentation. What I’m speaking of is notan age-dependent characteristic; rather it’s related to a state of pre-literacy.I think that as our brains develop, and particularly as we develop literacy, thebrain becomes more compartmentalized. We develop a point of view, an ego, asense of self, but we also sacrifice a lot to acquire those things. We give up alot for our left-brain dominance. I think we sense that loss; that’s why we liketo step out of it once in a while, using psychedelics or other altered states.Psychedelics make you childlike; they can reconnect you with that primal,pre-literate, pre-cognitive state. How can this not be a good thing? More peopleshould try it. We take ourselves, most of the time, much too seriously! "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 5 - Happy Day Rides [images/00006.jpg]> Denny with Skelly. For the last two decades, my family and I have lived in Marine on St. Croix, atown in eastern Minnesota just across the St. Croix River from Wisconsin. Lastyear, as every year, a good crowd turned out to celebrate the Fourth of July.The festivities started the night before with a spectacular fireworks displayover the river, then resumed in the morning with a parade down Judd Street,Marine’s main drag. The parade was, as usual, a motley assemblage; pretty muchanyone could take part, though it helped to have some kind of message or theme.The big news in July 2011 was the political stalemate that led Minnesota’s stategovernment to shut down a few days earlier. The winning “float” featured agaggle of marchers carrying blank banners—their way of mocking a state thatcouldn’t even pay for ink. As always, the show was silly, hokey, drenched insmall-town Midwestern charm, and quite moving in a nostalgic way. It’s a yearlyreminder that though the pace of change in the world is ever accelerating,certain aspects of small-town life remain frozen in a timeless eternity oficonic Americana.My memories of childhood in Colorado include the treasured recollections ofevents that could have been plucked from the same summer-dazed grab bag as theFourth of July in Marine. As a kid in Paonia, the Fourth was second only toChristmas on my personal liturgical calendar. It was also Cherry Day, a seriesof events celebrating the luscious Bing cherries that were picked, in a goodyear, from the fruit orchards that covered the surrounding mesas. Back then, thelocal economy, such as it was, relied on two things: coal mining and fruitcultivation (apples, peaches, plums, apricots, and those sweet and succulentBings, ranging in color from dark ruby to midnight black). The mining persistsand has actually been more active in recent years, with the growing market forthe area’s high-quality coal reserves. But due to climate change and theuncertain harvests, the fruit industry has devolved into a gentleman’s hobby.Even back then, a late spring freeze regularly wiped out the cherry crop, whichmeant the town had to get its cherries from Fruita, near Grand Junction, aboutseventy miles to the west. True to its name, Fruita always seemed to have a goodharvest by the Fourth, a fact that many of Paonia’s farmers probably resented.There in the vaunted home of the best cherries in Western Colorado, it was neverclear before the end of May if the festivities in their honor could count onlocal supplies to meet demand.Though the cherries were good enough to tempt me and many other kids intodiarrhea-inducing excess, they were not the highlight of my Fourth of July. WhatI most eagerly awaited was the appearance of the traveling carnival. Happy DayRides was a dusty, ragamuffin caravan of carneys that would show up one dayunannounced (at least, unannounced to me) a week or so before the Fourth. Theirarrival served as a midpoint in the bucolic three-month ecstasy that was summerin Paonia. Here was proof that, yes, Cherry Day would happen, cherries or nocherries, and that the summer would spin itself out like every summer before it.Their two-week stay was an enchanted time, at least in the lives of young boys,inevitably followed by a touch of sadness. Their departure meant the end ofanother glorious, school-free, sun-drenched summer was not that far away.I was blessed among my peers to live across the street from Paonia Park, where,in one corner, Happy Day Rides would set up shop. I’d get up one June morningand there they’d be, having quietly straggled into town during the night. Theydidn’t look like much: just two or three semitrailers and a few flatbed trailersand smaller trucks. They had no large animals, no lions or tigers or elephants,probably because it was too expensive to keep such a menagerie fed and cared foron the road. None of this mattered; I was most interested in the rides, whichthe carneys would spend the next few days unpacking and assembling like ascuffed-up, adult-scale erector set. As these marvels took shape—the rollercoaster, the Ferris wheel, the Tubs Of Fun, the electric train, and, in lateryears, the Octopus and the Loop-O-Planes—I tracked the progress in minutedetail, utterly engaged. Major fun was a few days out, and I was on it,monitoring the situation from morning till night.In retrospect, it’s a wonder the carneys didn’t chase me off more than they did,which wasn’t often. According to conventional wisdom, these people were apt tobe thieves, sleaze balls, and bums. And yes, our parents warned us about thedangers of hanging out with them, of being abducted and forced into labor (orworse). But Happy Day Rides wasn’t just any sleazy carnival; it was our sleazycarnival, a “clean,” family-oriented operation that the town mostly welcomed.Whether their good reputation was deserved or not, I had no idea. What matteredto me were their fantastic machines, which created much happiness until theywere broken down and carried off as quickly and quietly as they arrived, leavinga new faint grief over the approach of fall. Beyond that, there was Christmas tolook forward to, and the autumn distraction of Halloween, but in the distortedtime scale of boyhood consciousness, those events seemed as distant as the nextglaciation.I may have had a touch of Asperger syndrome or perhaps even high-functioningautism as a child. I hazard this self-diagnosis because l loved to rock, andoften did so, back and forth, in my chair, quite happily for hours. I rememberthe big rocking chair in the living room of my aunt and uncle’s ranch on theCrystal River, the place where we spent so many weekends. The chair was old andhad a long back-and-forth arc to it and a very satisfying creak. As soon as wearrived on a Friday night, I’d head for the chair and start to rock and prettymuch stay there for the duration, only stopping for meals or when my folksinsisted I go outside and play in the beautiful forests and pastures. I enjoyedall that, but I was always happy to return. Unlike the present era, where theslightest behavioral anomaly is viewed as pathological, my rocking was seen as alittle “quirky” but not really harmful, and anyway, “He’ll grow out it.” And Idid.One lifelong characteristic that my rocking did reveal was a fondness for novelexperience and stimulation. From an early age I was a junkie for proprioceptivenovelty; I loved the feelings of floating and flying, of centrifugalacceleration and g-forces, of distorted body image and queasy stomachbutterflies. The carnival rides, especially the Octopus and the Tubs Of Fun,delivered these sensations more reliably and intensely than I could induce in mychair, or on the swing set in the park, or in the occasional weightless episodesthat Dad liked to indulge in when he took me up for a spin in his PiperTri-Pacer. These were all cool and fun, but nothing delivered like the carnivalrides! The rides were the ultimate cheap thrill (actually not so cheap to aneight-year-old, but I had saved my allowance).Looking back, I have to believe that much of my later interest in drugsoriginated from my early love for “funny feelings” accessed through the carnivaland other DIY methods of altering consciousness. In his book The Natural Mind,Andrew Weil writes that it is almost universal for children of a certain age tospin themselves into a falling-down state of dizziness (I tried that, too)because they enjoy the unfamiliar feeling engendered by the disorientation andloss of balance. Indeed, Weil argues that the human brain and nervous system arehardwired to seek out novel perceptions, distorted body images, visionaryepisodes, and other forms of ecstatic experience, and this inbuilt proclivityexplains much of our fondness for substances that can trigger these alteredstates. Much of this activity is motivated by a curiosity akin to a scientist’s;the individual is posting data points in the unmapped territory of possiblesensation. Some people go in for extreme sports like bungee jumping or skydivingfor similar reasons; others pursue novel sensations through drugs, and, ofcourse, there are those who enjoy combining pharmacologically inducedalterations with their favorite risky sports, though not me. In fact, when itcame to really risky behaviors like downhill skiing, rock climbing, or autoracing, I’m a bit of a wimp. I was overcautious about engaging in behaviors thatwere likely to get my bones broken or my ass killed, and this may be one reasonI eventually came to favor drug-induced novelty over extreme sports.This cautious streak probably stood me in good stead when it came to drugs,because as a rule I paid attention to those key variables of “set and setting”that Leary and the rest were always harping about. It made sense that one shouldexplore altered states in a relatively safe environment. Not all my friendsapproached pharmacology with such common sense, and some lived to regret it;others never had that luxury, because they didn’t live. I dare say I learned athing or two from the wondrous contraptions that showed up each summer withHappy Day Rides. My carnival experiences were formative for me, and gave me anearly fondness for funny feelings that has persisted through out my life. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 6 - The Nobody People The campaign of brotherly terror that Terence waged on me from age four or fivecontinued for many years. It was during the nights, of course, that it reachedits zenith. We shared a bedroom and had separate beds. According to Terence, hewould sometimes quietly slip out of his bed, tiptoe across to mine, and standabove my sleeping form, hands raised in the tickle-attack mode, ready to pounce.And in this position he’d stand for hours, savoring the psychological meltdownhe’d trigger if he acted. But he never did. It was satisfying enough justknowing that he could. Looking back, I doubt he really did this. I think hisstory was just another way to maintain the climate of fear.A major element in that were the frightening stories he used to whisper as wecowered under the covers, long after lights-out. A scary TV show, a ghost story,or just some confabulation from his fertile and twisted mind, would serve asfodder for these nightly horrors. Once we watched a TV adaptation of H.H.Munro’s short story “Sredni Vashtar” presumably from a 1961 series, Great GhostTales, which first aired when I was ten. It’s a nasty little horror story abouta young boy who keeps a polecat-ferret in a shed and worships the animal as avicious, vengeful god, a secret he keeps at first from his overbearing guardian,to her ultimate misfortune. For months, Terry was able to strike the most abjectfear into me by simply uttering the story’s title.But by far the most terrifying theme of Terry’s nocturnal campaign, revisitednight after night, was the Nobody People, aka the No-Body People. In thelanguage of nineteenth-century ghost stories, the entities would be known aswraiths. Terence gave them a name and turned them loose in my already overactiveand hyper-suggestible imagination. The Nobody People lived in shadows; in fact,they were shadows, or they existed on some gloomy threshold between theinsubstantial and the real. You could see them, or sense them, at night, lurkingin the shadows of the closet, or under the bed, or in the hollow of the bathtub.Rarely, you could sense them during the day, in the corners of dimly lit rooms,in basements or cellars, in the crawl spaces under the house. But primarily theywere creatures of the dark and the night. You were not likely to run into aNobody Person outside on a bright, sunny day. No, they were denizens of a shadowworld; they liked to hang out in graveyards (especially in open graves), andgloomy glens, and caves.Not that I was into hanging around such places, not on your life! I didn’t haveto; the Nobody People were especially fond of the shadowy parts of our bedroom.It was Nobody People Central, our bedroom. You knew they were there, Terry said,because sometimes you’d walk into the dark room and something would flit by,maybe brush you gently in passing, and then melt into the shadows again. Ibought it; I agreed that this could happen, and had happened, though of courseit never did. For one thing, due to my constant, fully deployed Nobody Peopleantennae, the idea that I would ever, under any circumstances, for any reason,walk into a darkened room without turning the light on was simply preposterous.I would be sure to snake my hand around the doorjamb and hit the light switchbefore entering a room. Terry knew of this practice and threatened to be hidingon the other side of the threshold one day where he could seize my hand andscare the living bejeezus out of me. But he never did. I guess he was too busycarrying out the rest of his terrorist agenda and just never got around to thisone.As far as I remember, the Nobody People never actually did anything bad, or didvery much at all. I guess they were frightening because of the idea that we areat all times surrounded by unseen, barely sensed entities living among us,conducting their dreary affairs in a shadowy parallel world (though the term“living” is probably a misnomer, because they were understood to be, possibly,the remnants of the dead, or at least not living in the sense that we wereliving). They would have had very little power to frighten me if I had not beena willing participant-observer. I believed in them just enough that I couldconvince myself, in that delicate twilight between waking and actual sleep, thatI could see them materializing out of the shadows, stately processions of themwafting across the room, and merging with the shadows on the other side. It’s atestament to the power of suggestion. Plant the seed of an idea in someone’smind, repeat it often enough, and pretty soon they begin to believe it eventhough, rationally, it makes no sense. It also helps if the victim’s reasoningfaculties and cognitive categories are still rather fluid and not yet fullyformed, which was likely when I was between five and eight, the period when theNobody People were most active.Which moves me to ponder another aspect of this. Why do people like to befrightened? You have only to look at a list of recent blockbusters or scan thelate-night TV schedule for proof that people love having the daylights scaredout of them! It’s a multibillion-dollar industry. And it wouldn’t work without avoluntary and deliberate suspension of disbelief, to some extent. One has toagree to buy into the premise. Certainly I pretended not to enjoy Terence’spsychological tortures, but I suspect a part of me did enjoy them. I wastitillated; there was a kind of thrill in being frightened, and it was notentirely unpleasant. To titillate now means to stimulate or excite, especiallyin a sexual way, but its archaic meaning was to touch lightly, or tickle. Ahhah! As I’ve noted, Terence refined the practice of tickling me into a dark art;and though I hated it, I was ambivalent. Sometimes I almost liked being tickledmercilessly, just as I sometimes liked being frightened to death.The Nobody People were my first encounters with the idea that one can coexistwith an unseen world of spirits or other entities. Certainly this perspective isintegral to the shamanic worldview, and is encountered in altered statestriggered by the Amazonian brew known as ayahuasca, among other shamanicsubstances. The ayahuasca landscape is a virtual battleground populated withmalevolent spirits, but also with allies, plant teachers, animal spirit guides,ancestral spirits, and other morally ambiguous entities. The shaman’s task isessentially one of extra-dimensional diplomacy, that is, to identify and forgealliances with the beneficial entities while guarding against those that don’tnecessarily have one’s best interests in mind. When I eventually accessed suchrealms with ayahuasca, the idea of a morally ambiguous dimension in which onerubbed up against ghostly entities (sometimes literally) was already familiar. Ihad been introduced to it long before by the Nobody People.One can access those dimensions through pharmacological triggers other thanayahuasca. In fact, the nightshades, which include belladonna, the genus Datura,and the South American “tree daturas” are even more reliable. A full dose ofdatura will put you right into that twilight world where wraiths and ghostslurk, where you can see and talk to them (though they rarely respond). I believethat accidental or deliberate encounters with the shadowy datura spaces are thebasis for the belief, in many cultures, in a land of the dead or of ghosts. Whenencountered, these dimensions and entities certainly seem real enough, at leastas real as ordinary waking consciousness. With practice, you can work magic inthese realms that can have real impact in the ordinary reality of wakingconsciousness. Certainly, if you can contrive to get some of the substance intoyour intended victim, they can be manipulated or influenced in ways they mightotherwise resist, because datura induces confusion and delirium; it undermines aperson’s will, and conveniently enough, wipes out memories of what has happened.Datura, nightshade consciousness, is the ultimate power trip; it is the basis ofwitchcraft in European traditions and of brujeria, or black magic, in SouthAmerica. It is not to be trifled with. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 7 - The Collector [images/00013.jpg]> Terence in the Amazon, 1971. (Photo by S. Hartley) According to some relatives, Terence’s early mischief was not confined to thefamily. He had a reputation for being hard on his peers, and some parentsdevised strategies to protect their offspring from his excesses. I suspect,however, that many of those kids experienced a certain thrill when Terence’sattention swung their way, unnerving though it could be. From an early age, hewas front and center, the producer, director, and star of his own movie;everyone else was supporting cast. A lot of people wanted to be in his movie; alot of people still do. And when I was a child, nobody wanted in more than Idid.Viewing their eldest child as the “smart one,” our parents made every effort toencourage Terence’s intellectual development, and to participate in his numeroushobbies. It took them about a decade to realize that I was also smart, thoughnot in the same way. Was their reluctance to see that earlier an unconsciousexpression of their guilt over foisting a pesky little brother on Terry, or wasit just the natural fate of a younger child? Terence was indeed a smart andcurious boy, interested in many things; he also had a way of sucking the air outof a situation that could leave me gasping. Perhaps the firstborn is destined toget all the attention, the new clothes, the privileges, while a younger sib hasto make do. Anyway, that’s how it seemed in our family. In many of our sharedactivities, Terence led and I followed, at least when he allowed it, and Ididn’t really mind that. The four-year age difference made whatever Terence wasinto that much cooler than my own pursuits, so I obviously wanted to tag alongand get involved.Collecting was a big thing for him, as it was for many other kids back then whoaspired to be scientists of a sort. The scientific interest in collections—ofrocks, plants, animals, insects—now seems like a quaint relic of the Victorianera. But the life sciences have been impoverished by the decline in collecting.Today, it’s possible to get so deeply immersed in genetics and molecular biologythat one never fully appreciates biodiversity from the organismic level. Astudent can now get a degree in biology without ever having taken a course inecology or organismic biology, which is really a shame. Something essential islost when you only look at biology through the lens of molecular biology.Terry spent much of his childhood happily collecting stuff: shells, rocks,fossils, and other curiosities, and over time he built some impressivecollections. Our father built him a homemade rock polisher, one of many thingsDad did over those years to try to connect with his geeky, brilliant son. Thereading and learning that went along with the collecting actually helped tofoster Terence’s interest in science and nature—and mine as well. I was neverhappier than on those occasions when Terence would allow me to tag along on hiscollecting forays. Among the best times I remember were our occasional trips tothe ’dobes, an arid region near town that once had been submerged beneath aninland sea. My mother would pack a picnic lunch, and we’d head out to thebadlands for a few hours of searching for shark’s teeth. The tiny, shiny,prehistoric remains were everywhere; you could sift through the soil and come upwith several hundred in the course of an afternoon. We accumulated jars and jarsof the darned things, learning about biology, geology, evolution, and the notionof “deep time” in the process.Another favorite weekend outing for us was to visit the north rim of the BlackCanyon National Monument, located near the town of Crawford about an hour’sdrive south of Paonia. It’s one of the most spectacular geological formations onthe continent. Though much smaller than the Grand Canyon, which is broad butrelatively shallow, the Black Canyon is a narrow gorge slashed out of the rockover at least two million years of relentless erosion by the fast-flowing river.The gorge is one of the most extreme vertical environments I’ve ever seen, withdepths that approach 3,000 ft. The Black Canyon was my first encounter with theconcept of an abyss. A family story relates that when we visited the canyon onone occasion shortly after I began to talk, my mother picked me up so I couldlook over the railing. My comment at the time was “Big hole.” Indeed, it was.At age eleven or twelve, Terence began collecting insects and built up a finebutterfly and moth collection, including a few exotic specimens he purchased.His tarantulas, blue morpho butterflies, and gigantic horned stag beetlesarrived via the mail-order catalogs he found listed in the back of Science News,a thin weekly bulletin we subscribed to for years. Terence’s entomologicalinterests proved more lasting than his other collection-related pursuits, and asa young adult he continued to seek out butterflies on his global ramblings.Though his passion was very real, he found the persona of the collector to be agood cover when traveling in tropical countries. As he noted, “When you show upin a village with a butterfly net, it’s immediately obvious to even the youngestchild why you are there; and it’s non-threatening, it’s friendly. You areimmediately tagged as a harmless eccentric.” Terence would know, having spentmonths exploring the outer islands of Indonesia under that guise in 1970, on therun from Interpol for smuggling hashish. Later, the same cover worked prettywell on our travels in Colombia when our real quest was for exotichallucinogens.Collecting for Terence was both a passion and a useful skill; his ability towrite those tiny, tiny labels used in mounting specimens landed him a work-studyjob as an entomology technician at the California Academy of Sciences during hisundergraduate years at Berkeley. Later, after returning to Berkeley from SouthAmerica in 1972, he made good money mounting butterflies for a Japanese purveyorof exotic specimens. Best part about it was, he could do it totally stoned, andwhile holding his customary afternoon salons with the friends who dropped by hisloft apartment to smoke hash and hang and rave. I fondly remember some of thosesessions myself, with the late afternoon sun illuminating the dancing dustmotes. That loft was the site of many a fine conversation accompanied bymultiple bowls of excellent hash.Decades later, after Terence had passed on, his lifelong interest in collectingcame up in a touching and beautiful way. Many of the collections that Terencemade in Indonesia and Colombia were never mounted, and remained stored in smalltriangular envelopes folded from paper squares, a common method of handlingspecimens in the field. The envelopes had been sealed with a few mothballs inlarge cracker tins and other containers, then packed in a trunk, and hence wereperfectly preserved for decades while Terence was busy elsewhere.After he died, his daughter Klea, then only nineteen, inherited them, and sheturned out to be the perfect recipient. An excellent photographer with a highlyrefined aesthetic, Klea, the younger of Terence’s two children, eventually usedher artistic skills and vision to transform the collection into a beautifultribute to her father. She didn’t mount the specimens in the conventional way.Instead, she created a work in which each butterfly was photographed togetherwith its envelope. Terence had snipped those little wrappers out of foreignnewspapers, hotel stationery, notebook pages, or any other handy piece of paper.Once a specimen had been caught, he wrote the date and location on the envelopein his tiny, meticulous script. Klea’s display of these images amounted to achronicle of Terence’s travels through the Indonesian archipelago and thejungles of Colombia. It also evoked a moment in cultural history. The newspaperclippings revealed fragments of articles and headlines about Kent State, Nixon,Vietnam; others were faded pieces of full-color magazine ads, hotel receipts,and Chinese newsprint. Together they formed a snapshot of a moment in time,juxtaposed and reinforced by the ephemerality of the specimens they held, stillas vibrant and bright as the day they were collected.Klea’s gallery installation in San Francisco in 2008 was entitled The ButterflyHunter, and she later released the project as a limited edition artist book (seewww.kleamckenna.com [http://www.kleamckenna.com/]). She took care to ensure herquiet tribute wasn’t “about” Terence per se. She didn’t want to capitalize onhis fame, but rather to present him in a pristine light as simply the butterflyhunter, someone who existed before she did, someone who became her father. Hisearly passion would not be how the world came to know him. Many of those who sawthe exhibition were not aware that it was about a celebrated figure. Her simple,elegant presentation was of a man who collected butterflies, and this man washer father. What else needs to be said? Although Terence’s passion for insect collecting lasted well into adulthood,none of his boyhood hobbies could match amateur rocketry for sheer excitement.When he got interested in this incendiary pastime, at age eleven or twelve, ourfather was an enthusiastic partner. What is it about guys? They just like toblow things up, the more noisy, dangerous, and spectacular the better. Modelrocketry, which was just then catching on, definitely called for adultsupervision, and Dad devoted many a weekend to helping Terry build and launchthe solid-fuel rockets that arrived as mail-order kits. These usually consistedof a reinforced cardboard tube, a wooden nose cone, balsa wood fins, five or sixsolid-fuel cartridges, some fuse cord, and (in the deluxe models) a paperparachute tied to a plastic monkey that was supposed to safely eject at theapogee of the flight. That part usually failed, and when it did, the monkey-nautended up getting lost in the bush somewhere. But some of those kits performedpretty well; on a good day, when there was no wind, those rockets could rise acouple of thousand feet.I’m pleased to report this is still an active hobby for a lot of youngsters.Even the venerable company we came to rely on for our kits, Estes Industries, isstill in business, but their newer vehicles look a lot more impressive than theones we launched. It’s nice to know that in this age when parents feel compelledto overprotect their kids and never let them do anything remotely dangerous (orfun), it’s still an option for young boys and girls to get into serious mischiefthrough the reckless deployment of model rockets.With our father keeping an eye on things, we were actually quitesafety-conscious. We did most of our launching at the Paonia airport where hekept his plane, about four miles outside of town. The airstrip was on a narrowmesa the size and shape of a large aircraft carrier, surrounded for miles bysage and scrub, making it the perfect site. We dug a bunker in the earth of thehillside and reinforced it with scrap plywood and sheet metal we found in theairport hangers. The next step was to set up the rocket on its pad, attach somefuse cord to the fuel cartridge, and string it back to our makeshift barrier.Ensconced behind it, we’d light the long fuse with a match and recite themandatory “ten-nine-eight” incantation down to liftoff. How many laws weviolated on these outings I have no idea, and it didn’t really matter. It wasrather rare for a plane to land at the airport back then, so we were neverreported as a hazard to aviation.Once you’re under the spell of high explosives and glimpse the potential forsome really spectacular launches, you want them to be better, higher, faster,and more dangerous. What you want, in fact, is a liquid-fueled rocket. Liquidfuels like methanol and other even more volatile substances can propel a rocket5,000 feet straight up in a flash. But liquid-fueled rockets are also inherentlymore dangerous; the “burn” is hard to control, and if there is an undetectedleak or weakness in the rocket wall it can easily rupture. Liquid-fuel rocketsare basically small bombs, which is why our father drew the line there,forbidding us to work with them.Having never seen a line he didn’t want to cross, Terence decided that’s exactlywhat we’d do. We began a secret R&D program, pursued only on weekdays when ourfather was on the road. Terence somehow got plans for building a tinyliquid-fueled rocket out of a CO2 cartridge like the kind used in pellet guns,about four inches long and less than an inch in diameter. I’ve forgotten whatthe actual fuel was, but it was probably methanol. We built a customized launchpad for this diabolical device using angle iron and conduit piping. The rocketsat at the base, loosely cradled between three conduits that provided flightguidance, or at least pointed the thing in the general direction of the sky.Our invention took its only flight one balmy midsummer evening. Our mother hadleft for her bridge club, leaving us to our own devices for a few hours. Wewaited until it was sufficiently dark before we lugged the pad and thediminutive rocket to the football field cross the street. By then we were usinga battery-operated gizmo that lit the rocket with a spark just under the exhaustnozzle—very cool. Once we’d mounted our vehicle on the pad, we conducted theobligatory countdown and triggered the ignition. Immediately a tremendous sonicboom reverberated across the valley! The rocket broke the sound barrier beforeit even cleared the pad, and disappeared faster than the eye could track, neverto be seen again.But we had more immediate concerns. We were utterly convinced that the sonicboom had shattered every window within a five-mile radius. We grabbed the launchpad and hightailed it back to the house, where we stashed the evidence in thepatio storage room and hid ourselves in the bedroom, expecting the police toshow up at any minute. But they never did. When our mother came home, we askedher as innocently as we could if she’d heard a loud noise earlier in theevening, which she hadn’t, and there were no shattered windows reported the nextday. The boom we heard in our boyhood imagination was perhaps not as loud as ithad seemed. Then again, maybe we were just lucky, and no one had been payingattention. After that episode, we halted our rocket experiments—that one washard to top—and moved on to other things. We’d scared ourselves intodiscontinuing the secret program, never quite sure if we’d parked that damnthing in low earth orbit or not. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 8 - Flying, Fishing, and Hunting [images/00018.jpg]> Denny and his father beside the Piper Cub, in 1956. Our father enjoyed sharing his passion for flying with us, but by the time hegot his own plane, Terence had reached early adolescence, and the tensionsbetween them were well advanced. Whereas I flew a lot with Dad as a teenager,Terence remained mostly outside that bond. I learned to fly and land the planepretty well, but I never got my license. The idea of sitting in a classroomstudying engine mechanics and navigation never appealed to me. What’s more,though for many years I fantasized about being a professional pilot, I hadsevere myopia from birth and wore thick glasses, so there was little chance I’dever achieve that childhood dream—one of many. My visual limitations led me toput a pilot’s life on the shelf, and there it stayed.Flying was ecstasy for our father, and we shared that feeling when we flewtogether. Dad never felt freer or more alive than in the air, high above thecares and tribulations of the world. When I was starting to experiment withpsychedelics as a teenager, I tried to explain my interest in altered states bycomparing it to flying; it was a thrill, it was a rush, it was ecstasy! Hecouldn’t really see it. To him, everything about “drugs” was bad, and it wasimpossible to have a rational conversation about the topic. In that, he was likemany in his generation; their drugs of choice, alcohol and tobacco, were soaccepted as not to be considered drugs. My father once told me that the effectsof alcohol were due to its effect on the muscles! The idea that it affected thebrain was an alien concept to him. As for all the other substances that werereferred to then (and now) as drugs in a catchall sense, he clearly knew thosedid affect the brain, and that had to be a bad thing.Dad not only greatly enjoyed flying, he was an excellent pilot known for hisskill at flying in the Colorado Rockies. It was a skill worthy of recognition;flying in the high mountains is tricky and dangerous, given the changeableweather, unpredictable winds, and other hazards. Dad was often called out by thelocal Civil Air Patrol to search for some plane that had gone down in themountains. Most of these crashes were caused by ignorance, bad judgment, orinexperience on the part of pilots my father called “flatland furriners” with nobusiness flying in that rugged terrain. In most cases he was right. He flew foryears in the mountains, under some pretty harrowing conditions, and never hadany problems. He had good judgment and knew when not to push it.My father spent years sharing a Piper Cub with the other members of a localflying club before he got his Tri-Pacer. I mentioned how he used his plane tocover his vast sales territory, which he enjoyed. The plane also gave him moretime with us in Paonia, which on balance was probably a good thing though itincreased the opportunities for conflict. Wings certainly gave us options thatweren’t available to other families, like weekend trips. We could take off forthe Grand Canyon, Mesa Verde, Carlsbad Caverns, or Arches National Monument andbe back home in time for school on Monday morning. It was great fun, and I thinkit broadened our perspective beyond that of most of our peers. In the summer of1962, when I was eleven and Terry was fifteen, my father borrowed a somewhatbigger plane, a Piper Comanche, and took us on a two-week trip to the SeattleWorld’s Fair, an amazing experience for both of us. The theme of the fair,Century 21, was a paean to the utopian, Jetsons-style future that supposedly layjust a few short decades ahead. For two geeky boys who were already steeped inscience fiction and popular science, to tour that world was a thrill.My most memorable flying experiences took place closer to home. My father had afriend who had a ranch farther up the Crystal River valley from the one owned bymy aunt and uncle. He also owned a small plane and had built a rough dirtairstrip on his land beside some of the river’s best fishing spots. My fatherhad permission to fly in and catch a few fish whenever he wanted. It became aregular thing for the two of us to get up early in the morning, fly over, andreturn in time for breakfast with a mess of fresh trout to fill out the menu.This was an incredibly cool thing to do, but also tricky! Getting in and out ofthat airstrip required every bit of Dad’s skill as a pilot, due to the updraftsand downdrafts he had to contend with. Once you came over the ridge on the wayin, you had to drop like a stone in order to lose enough altitude to make a runat the strip; and you only got one chance. He had to put the plane into whatfelt like a suicide dive, only pulling up at the last minute to make a perfectlanding. Flying out was similar. When taking off in the thin mountain air, thedanger was that we wouldn’t have the lift to clear the ridge. As soon as we leftthe ground, Dad had to put the plane into a steep climb and risk stalling, inorder to avoid the downdrafts from the winds that were howling over the ridge.If we didn’t make the altitude on the first try, there was no going back; we’dend up as a crumbled piece of tinfoil on the unforgiving rocks below.I didn’t realize at the time that we were taking a significant risk every timewe made that trip. Dad must have known, but I did not. I never worried for aminute about the danger. My dad, my amazing father, the legendary mountainpilot, was at the controls, and there was simply no way we were going down. Itcouldn’t happen, and it didn’t. He was that good. I was that naive. Looking backon these experiences, I think we both must have been a little nuts to haveattempted them. If you were a kid growing up in Western Colorado in the 1950s and ’60s, “huntin’and fishin’ ” were just things you did. They were pretty much in your blood.Except when they weren’t, which was the case with me. Our father was anexcellent fly fisherman. I tried to learn to fly fish, but I was lousy at it. Icould never get the hang of casting the fly into the right ripple in the streamwhere the fish were lurking, let alone to know, as he did, they’d be there. Onthe rare occasions when I did catch something, I’d have to kill it, usually bybeating its head against the nearest rock. I didn’t like killing fish; it wasthe most distasteful part of the whole exercise. I got pretty good at cleaningthem, but I didn’t care for that either, especially the part where I had toremove the fish shit from their intestinal tract, located just below the spinalcolumn. Yuck! So I never really made the cut as a fisherman, much to ourfather’s disappointment, I’m sure. Later, our outings got better once he’dabandoned any expectation that I’d actually fish. Instead he’d fish, and I’d gooff somewhere, smoke a little weed, and hunt mushrooms. By then I’d developed apassion for hunting mushrooms, and I had a pretty good eye. I was always lookingfor the Holy Grail, in the form of Amanita muscaria, but they were rare. I didfind plenty of delicious edibles, though, and enjoyed many a feast.I was only a little more successful at hunting than fishing. I had a .410shotgun inherited from my great grandfather, a beautiful gun that fired a singleshell, handcrafted for his wife when he was stationed at a military post inSouth Africa. Or so went the family legend, which may or may not have been true.Dad had a bigger gun, a 12-gauge double-barrel. Shooting ducks and pheasantswasn’t that hard, and I regularly brought them down. But as with the fish, youthen had to clean them, a messy business neither of us liked; we were alwaystrying to give away our kill to friends. I’m sorry to admit it, but the pleasurefor us was in the hunt.Hunting elk and deer was a more serious business, not least because we usedhigh-powered rifles, and you could get yourself seriously killed if you weren’tcareful. Shotguns could be just as dangerous, of course, but they lacked theaura of lethality that rifles had. Also, hunting large animals was moreassociated with the whole manhood thing. It was a shamanic activity, a rite ofpassage. Somewhere in all manly men (and manly men we were, or at least wantedto be) there is a Paleolithic warrior lusting to take spear in hand and head outon the ice sheet in search of saber-toothed cats. We were living out that primalquest, reconnecting with our hunter-shaman selves, albeit with bettertechnology. That included the car ride we’d take every fall to stage ourreenactment at Lee Sperry’s ranch on West Muddy Creek.Lee was a real cowboy, a cattleman who operated an enormous ranch with severalthousand head. Every hunting season, he opened the place to tourist hunters fromTexas, mostly, but also my father and his friends. For two weeks we lived therein a caveman’s paradise, surrounded by a testosterone-drenched, stinking,grizzled bunch that drank hard liquor and communicated in grunts. In reality, ofcourse, these folks (with the exception of Lee, who was as tough as he looked)were soft tenderfoots—accountants and salesmen, teachers and grocers, mostlysedentary and well padded. But for two weeks we were the fucking Clan of theCave Bear. I recall it as a fantastic experience, though much of it I disliked.I was afraid of the horses we had to ride; I didn’t enjoy getting up in the coldat four in the morning, breaking the ice in the watering trough in the earlydawn; I didn’t want to spend all day on the trail getting my ass rubbed raw,freezing most of the time, then getting sunburned and eaten by bugs, beforedragging back, dog-tired, at day’s end. It was terrible. It was wonderful! Thesewere some of the richest experiences I ever shared with my Dad. I nevercomplained or whined, because real men don’t whine, and I wanted more thananything to be accepted as part of the clan.Dad and his friends were looking to bag elk. Hunting for deer was beneath them;deer were for tourists and wimps (and children, like me). Elk were big anddangerous, a fitting prey for manly men, and besides, you got a lot more meatwhen you brought one down. And bringing one down was a big deal. For one thing,it meant that the hunt was probably over for the day, because you had to gut andhaul the animal, sometimes in pieces, back to the curing house at the ranch. Elkare huge animals that easily weigh 500 pounds. It took several men to hoist oneup in a tree using a block and tackle slung over a limb. The next step was toslit the animal’s throat and let the blood drain, then cut open the body andremove the viscera. After cutting the skin at certain places, we’d peel it backto reveal the muscles and tendons. To call this “dressing” the animal struck meas odd, because what we were actually doing was undressing it. After that, thesmaller carcasses could be loaded on a packhorse and carted back to the ranch.The bigger ones had to be cut in half and loaded on two horses—a grisly, bloody,smelly mess.Back at the curing house, we’d hoist the dead creature on hooks, and there itwould hang for up to two weeks. What was known as “curing” really amounted torotting; but it did seem to tenderize the meat and improve its flavor. Uncuredmeat had a “gamey” taste that made it less appealing. Frankly, it always tastedpretty gamey to me, but I learned to like it at least enough to eat it. Oncecured, the carcass went to Chapman’s Storage Lockers, where it was cut intopieces with band saws and other tools and stored. That was our meat for thewinter. At home, we had elk steaks every Saturday night for the next six monthswhether we wanted them or not, and believe me, at the end of six months, youdidn’t want them. What I would have done by then for a nice beef burger or apiece of fried chicken! Sometimes I’d complain that the meat was tough, and myfather would respond with a standard retort: “It’s a lot tougher when thereisn’t any!” Hard to argue with that.I took part in the annual hunt for a few years, until I was twelve or thirteen.Terence had gone through the same initiation, but the two of us never had achance to partake in that rite together. By the time I was old enough to go,Terence had lost interest, or had already left for California, where he spenthis last two years of high school.The truth is I was no better at hunting than I was at fishing, so I never endedup killing anything. Or almost never. Which was fine by me. Despite thediscomforts, I enjoyed riding horses all day through the aspen forests of thehigh country. At that time of the year, the aspens were putting on theirbrightest colors, blinding yellows and oranges in great swaths as far as the eyecould see. The air was crisp and tangy, just cold enough so you could see yourbreath; the sky was a robin-egg blue, as blue as it gets. The West Muddy was abeautiful place to be that time of year; bagging an elk or deer, fulfilling themission to actually kill something, seemed like an afterthought.Eventually, on what must have been my third or fourth trip, I did succeed inkilling my first and only deer, a nice-looking four-point buck. I was with Dadwhen I spotted it, in a little glen down the ridge, standing in a cluster ofaspen trees, sixty or seventy yards away. Dad spotted it at the same time, andinstructed me to get off the horse quietly, crouch down, and take my timeaiming. By the time I had, the thing had disappeared before my eyes, as if ithad melted back into the trees. But I went ahead and took aim at the spot whereit had been a moment before. I squeezed off a shot, more or less blindly. And asblind luck would have it, the deer had not moved; my aim was true. It was aclean shot to the neck, and the thing flopped down.Leading our horses, we walked slowly down the ridge to where the animal lay,still breathing but obviously near death. Dad unsheathed his hunting knife,walked up and slit its throat to end its suffering. I felt no joy at witnessingthis, no sense of triumph, no sense of pride. At that moment, I didn’t feelanything like a manly man. I felt like a murderer; I had killed somethingbeautiful and wild and free. But I could not show this emotion to my Dad, or tothe other men who by then were approaching. I bit my lip to keep from crying,pulled myself together, and began the grim task of skinning the creature I hadslain.That was the last time I went hunting with our father on the West Muddy. I hadundergone the rite of passage. I was now officially a member of the clan, amanly man among manly men. And that was enough. I have to admit I felt a touchof pride, though not for a killing a deer; I felt only nauseated and weak-kneedabout that. No, the pride was in knowing that I had made my father proud.Together we had shown his peers, now my peers, that I wasn’t just some geekyweirdo four-eyed gawky kid. I could be a brute with the best of them. In thatweird, twisted, uniquely male world where killing something is seen as a goodthing, I had risen to the occasion. The values of the clan were again affirmed. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 9 - Goodbye to All That [images/00022.jpg]> Terence and Dennis dressed for church, 1959. So this was the picture of our family life at the end of the 1950s, pulled frommemory like a faded snapshot from those innocent years. For me, it evokes thebreathless moment of eerie calm that settles over the landscape before a summerthunderstorm; nothing is happening, yet the air is charged with anticipation.There was a foreboding intuition that the old order, the old certainties, wouldsoon be swept away. Despite an apparent calm, social forces beyond anyone’scontrol were massing on the horizon, ready to rip the idyllic Norman Rockwellfantasy to shreds. Indeed, everything we thought we knew, everything we thoughtwe were, would soon be transfigured by the winds of change.Like most Americans, my brother and I had little sense of what forms this changewould take. But the signs were there, discernible at least to a few astuteobservers. With respect to psychedelics and their impacts—both on us personally,and on the wider culture—there were only hints. Although the effects of LSD hadbeen known since the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann accidentally exposed himselfto the drug in 1943, five years after he’d discovered it at Sandoz, it remaineda curiosity, the plaything of a few psychologists, writers, artists, and covertresearchers at the CIA. In 1953, William Burroughs, the literary icon of the“beat” generation, had wandered the Putumayo region of the upper Amazon lookingfor ayahuasca; his correspondence with the poet Allen Ginsberg on the topicbecame a book, The Yage Letters, a decade later. That journey prefigured our ownquixotic quest to the area in the early seventies. Though Burroughs was oftenout front when it came to drugs, ayahuasca was already old news by the time hewent looking for it, at least to R. E. Schultes, the Harvard ethnobotanist whohad been documenting the region’s plants and their pharmacological propertiessince 1941. Aldous Huxley’s classic 1954 essay on his experience with mescaline,The Doors of Perception, stirred interest and criticism, though largely at firstamong philosophers and theologians. Timothy Leary’s fateful encounter with magicmushrooms at a resort in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in August 1960, radically alteredthe direction of his life, but his name was not widely known until the scandalthat led to his dismissal from Harvard in 1963.In the McKenna household and surely many others, there was one outstandingexception to this blackout: R. Gordon Wasson’s report on his rediscovery of thelong-suppressed tradition of shamanic mushroom use among the Mazatecs of Mexico,published in Life on May 13, 1957. With its millions of subscribers, Life wasthe epitome of the era’s glossy photo magazine—and the unlikely portal throughwhich awareness of the magic mushrooms and the strange realms they renderedaccessible filtered into mass consciousness. It was a rather stealthy debut;there was no pejorative spin to the story, no cautionary warnings about thedangers of drug abuse, the risk of insanity, leaping out of buildings, orchromosome damage. All that came later, and in any event was mostly aimed atpsilocybin’s more potent, scarier cousin, LSD—itself the subject of a Life coverstory in March 1966. No, the 1957 piece was presented as a gee-whiz traveloguein the best National Geographic style. The intrepid explorers were on a fearlessquest to be “the first white men in recorded history to eat the divinemushrooms.” A New York banker turned ethnobotanist accompanied by asociety-photographer friend, Wasson summed up their first ritual succinctly: “Wechewed and swallowed these acrid mushrooms, saw visions, and emerged from theexperience awestruck.” A day later, Wasson introduced his wife and daughter tothe remarkable fungi, with the same results. Along with Allan Richardson’sphotos, the article was accompanied by stunning watercolor paintings by themycologist Roger Heim of the seven types of psychoactive mushrooms that werethen known. (Today the count is close to 200.) Most readers probably overlookedthe article, but the magazine’s wide circulation assured an audience amountingto hundreds of thousands.Among those intrigued was Albert Hofmann, who soon afterward isolated thepsychoactive molecule in the fungi—psilocybin. Directly or indirectly, Wasson’saccount jettisoned Leary out of a mainstream academic career and into a new roleof bringing psychedelics to the masses. Terence and I were influenced as well,though I must admit the article was of more interest to him than to me; I wasonly six. Terence was ten and curious about everything—and because he wascurious, I was curious, without really knowing what the piece was about. I doremember him trailing our mother as she did her housework, waving the magazine,demanding to know more. But of course she had nothing to add. Terence’scuriosity would linger, even if at the time he had no intimation of howimportant psychedelics, and especially mushrooms, would become for us, in eventsstill years away. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 10 - The Big Picture Television, glorious television, found its way into our home around 1958. Inmany ways, its appearance marked the true end of the innocent era I’vedescribed, an era when local preoccupations were paramount. Like so many westerntowns, Paonia had its initial emblazoned on a nearby hill. If you looked outpast the end of Main Street, there it was, an affirmation of local identity tiedsomehow to the high school football team. As the only point high enough toreceive the signal from stations in Grand Junction and Montrose, that hill,known as the P, was destined to have a role in plugging us into the GlobalVillage. So were Joe and George Abseck of A&M Electric. For better or worse,they took the initiative to set up and maintain the booster station atop the Pthat captured the broadcasts.The picture was black and white, of course, and its quality was dismal: grainyand full of static. I know we got CBS and some other programs, but it would be awhile before all the major networks reached us in full. Nevertheless, TV openeda window onto the wider culture, formerly accessible only through radio. Wecould watch The Ed Sullivan Show, The Twilight Zone, Gunsmoke, Have Gun–WillTravel, Rawhide, and Sea Hunt. Another favorite, The Outer Limits, arrivedlater. I remember the first televised presidential debate in the fall of 1960,when John F. Kennedy, the shining knight, vanquished Richard Nixon with his fiveo’clock shadow and threatening frown. Three years later, we’d watch the somberpageantry of Kennedy’s funeral cortege: the coffin on the caisson and theprancing black horse in the dreary November gloom, the whole country inmourning, stunned, wondering what the hell had gone wrong with America.The Kennedy era had begun on a note of optimism. There was a feeling of welcomechange in the air as the staid Eisenhower administration came to a close, and avibrant young president and his stylish wife moved into the White House withtheir two young children. The Cold War still loomed, as it had throughout thefifties, and so did the threat of a spreading proxy war in Southeast Asia. Butthe general feeling was that the nation had entered an era of prosperity,innovation, and scientific advance.Those years were marked by events and tensions that would shape American lifefor decades. In January 1961, Ike bid farewell with a famous speech that warnedthe country about the dangers posed by a growing military-industrial complex. Afew days later, Kennedy gave his famous “Ask-not” inaugural address, encouragingAmericans to look beyond self-interest to what they could for their country.Making good on a campaign promise, he started the Peace Corps in March. Justbefore he took office, the country had severed diplomatic ties with Castro’sCuba. The new president’s first major blunder occurred in April at the Bay ofPigs, a failed Cuban invasion mounted by anti-Castro exiles with American help.In November, Kennedy made a second profound mistake, sending thousands of“advisors” to Vietnam. By year’s end American helicopters were providing supportfor South Vietnamese troops. Declared or not, the Vietnam War, and the number ofAmericans fighting and dying there, would grow for years.That wasn’t the only action in 1961 with a long, lingering effect on thenational psyche. A treaty known as the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs wassigned in March, codifying into international law a number of bad ideas thathave plagued drug regulation ever since. In May, the civil rights movemententered a critical phase when the Freedom Riders, challenging racial segregationon a bus trip through the South, were assaulted by mobs in Alabama and laterjailed in the Mississippi State Penitentiary, despite Supreme Court actions thatshould have protected them. In October, the Soviets detonated a 58-megatonhydrogen bomb in the Arctic Ocean—still the largest explosive device evertriggered. The United States continued to expand its arsenal of intercontinentalballistic missiles with the first test launch of a Minuteman-1. Meanwhile, thecountry deployed numerous shorter-range missiles in Italy and Turkey, puttingMoscow within range of a nuclear strike.The Beatles began the string of appearances at Liverpool’s Cavern Club that ledto their global renown. The Rolling Stones formed a year later. On April 12,1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit the Earth,with Alan Shepard making the first American space flight—a short suborbitalone—within a matter of weeks.The Space Race had begun with the launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 inOctober 1957, but now it suddenly dominated the popular consciousness. If theRed Menace had pulled ahead at first, apparently endangering our cherished wayof life, John Glenn’s orbital mission in early 1962 made it feel like a deadheat. Satellite communications began, and one of two Mariner probes successfullysent back data from its flyby of Venus. Kennedy’s agenda for his “New Frontier”would find its most potent symbol in his plan to land men on the moon. “Wechoose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things,” he declared inHouston in September 1962, “not because they are easy, but because they arehard.” Within a month, the Cuban missile crisis became the world’s first nuclearshowdown, a confrontation averted when the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchevagreed to remove those weapons, backing down from Kennedy’s ultimatum.For my family, these and other events amounted to the background murmur of ourdaily lives. At the time, neither Terence nor I paid much attention to the news.Our concerns were still personal and local. Though the arrival of television hada huge impact on us, by then we were already bookish geeks, firmly ensconced inthe Gutenberg era and under no real threat of TV taking us over. Television wasentertainment, distracting fluff. For us, real learning and knowledge wouldalways come from books.The major exceptions to our disregard for current events were the space missionsand the tense weeks of the missile crisis. By the time of Gagarin’s historicflight, Terence and I were already steeped in the lore and excitement of spaceexploration, thanks to our father’s interest in space and aviation, and to thepulp science fiction magazines he’d leave around the house for us to read, alongwith the occasional issue of Popular Science and Scientific American. He was agreat believer in technology; like many in his generation, he envisioned ascientific utopia on the near horizon, powered by atomic energy and replete withspace stations, robots, and flying cars. Computers and their transformativeeffects on society weren’t yet on the radar for most, and wouldn’t be for atleast a decade. But thanks to science fiction, we lived in eager anticipation ofsuch marvelous advances. In our imaginations, we were already well beyond thesolar system, having long since left behind such mundane scenarios as orbitalspace stations and voyages to the moon. We were enthralled by the idea thatmankind’s unknown destiny lay far beyond this planet. Years before Star Trekmass-marketed our mix of optimism and yearning, we were certain that humans werebound to explore the trackless reaches of outer space, and that we’d be amongthose who would go.No wonder amateur rocketry was one of Terence’s main pursuits as a boy. Though Iparticipated in those exploits with him, amateur astronomy was my majorpreoccupation. I dreamed of someday becoming an astrophysicist and spent many acrystal-clear winter night freezing my keister off in the city park, trying toadjust my Edmunds Scientific 4½-inch reflector telescope to the celestialcoordinates needed to capture some nebula or galactic cluster. I never didreally get the hang of that, but I managed to find, by lucky accident, anabundance of marvelous celestial objects; cold or not, I was hooked. I still am,though now I do most of my sky surfing with an iPhone app. These days, you don’thave to search; you just hook your telescope up to your laptop, dump in thecoordinates, and it finds the object for you. Where’s the fun in that?I loved reading popular expositions of the latest cosmological ideas, like thosewritten by George Gamow and Fred Hoyle, vocal proponents of, respectively, theBig Bang and Steady State theories. I always leaned toward Gamow, a Russian-bornémigré, partly because he was a professor of astrophysics at the University ofColorado at Boulder, and I nurtured an ambition of one day studying under him.Another reason was that the Steady State theory seemed rather boring to me; Iliked the idea that the universe began with a really, really big bang. I wasquite serious about my studies. Besides reading the popular science literatureon astronomy, space exploration, and related topics, I also delved into thetechnical side in the obsessive way I had of getting into things. Terence gaveme a subscription to Sky & Telescope one year for my birthday, and I cherishedit, reading every issue from cover to cover even though I understood about halfof it. One summer I resolved not only to read but to copy everything in theEncyclopaedia Britannica related to astronomy, cosmology, and astrophysics.Every afternoon I’d show up at the Paonia Public Library, notebook in hand,select a volume of the Britannica and retire, monk-like, to a carrel in theupstairs reading room. I was quite content to spend those summer daystranscribing various essays while my peers were playing outside. It didn’t seemto harm me; in fact it was good training for future scholarly endeavors thatrequired a lot of focus. But after that one intense summer, I realized the taskwas hopeless and pointless, and I gave it up.From the beginning, Terence and I were both Big Picture people. We weren’tsweating the details; we wanted the answers to the ultimate questions. Thisinclination partly explains our early interest in metaphysics and philosophy. Wewere dissatisfied with the pat and shallow answers proffered by our Catholicfaith, and with the priests who, with a few exceptions, responded angrily, ordisingenuously, to our insistent questions. It became clear to us early on thatCatholic dogma was pretty much a fairy story concocted to satisfy the incuriousmasses, and we were buying none of it. That skepticism became a motivation tolook beyond the boundaries of our religious faith, as eventually we did.On the practical level, though, the Space Race brought it all home, literally,into our living rooms through the new medium of television. Suddenly, the notionof space exploration was no longer confined to the pages of pulp sci-fimagazines or geek publications like Popular Science—the geek label itself, ascurrently understood, was another spinoff of fifties sci-fi first used by thewriter Robert Heinlein, though the term’s popularity still lay decades ahead.Space exploration was real, it was happening, and you could watch it on TV. Andyou could do it with no less a luminary than CBS newscaster Walter Cronkite tonarrate the adventure. Like Edward R. Murrow and Howard K. Smith, Cronkitebelonged to a generation of old-school journalists who started out in print andradio and led the transition to television. Theirs was a respectable professionthen; journalists were trusted to give us the straight story, and no one in thesixties and seventies was more trusted than the fatherly Cronkite. He didn’tsoft-pedal the truth. The Kennedy assassination, the civil rights movement, theVietnam War, Watergate—Cronkite calmly explained them, articulating thereal-time history of a confusing and rapidly changing world.But what captivated me was Cronkite’s coverage of the space launches: first thetimid suborbital flights of the Mercury astronauts, then the Gemini missions,followed by the climactic Apollo voyages—the trip around the moon and then themomentous landing of Apollo 11 in July 1969. “Uncle Walter” was our witnessthrough all of it, and never more so than during those early morning vigils inmy living room when, in his company, I waited through yet another endless delayin the countdown due to some technical glitch or quirk in the weather. He alwayshad a trove of technical details to share, his droning recitations of statisticsand flight specs making the interminable holds tolerable, even interesting, fora bored and sleep-deprived youngster up at a brutally early hour. On thoseoccasions I bonded to Walter, wanted if possible to be him someday. I oftenpictured myself as the fearless purveyor of truth, bravely resisting a jostling,angry crowd as I reported on the political unrest in some foreign hotspot. A lotof my peers have similar recollections of Cronkite, surely linked to ourcollective experience of monitoring those early launches. We believed inCronkite then, like we believed in a lot of things that, with time, have grownto seem much less certain. “And that’s the way it is,” he’d famously say afterhis evening newscast, and we had no reason to doubt him. The early days of the Space Race were on my mind in July 2011, as I followed thesuccessful launch and landing of the orbiter Atlantis. With that—the 135th andlast flight of the space shuttle—another phase in the brief history of spaceexploration came to an end. The shuttle era had begun with the launch of theorbiter Columbia thirty years earlier, on April 12, 1981. That date was thetwentieth anniversary of Yuri Gagarin’s flight in 1961, the first time a humanhad ever traveled beyond the planet’s atmosphere. However short, Gagarin’sjourney was a feat of evolutionary significance. Though rarely discussed in suchterms, it was the first time since life had left the oceans for land billions ofyears ago that DNA-bearing organisms had penetrated a new and alien environment.Many attempts to leave the sea had surely occurred and failed, but only one hadto succeed for life to gain a permanent terrestrial foothold. The same may betrue of our first halting steps into space.Gagarin’s flight is more often remembered for its geopolitical importance. Theevil Russkies were about to beat us in space, it seemed, and at the technologygame in general. In schools and on the launch pads, we had to respond posthasteif we wanted to save our cherished way of life from the Red Menace. The Sovietsuccess pressed Kennedy to make his clarion call: America would put a man on themoon by the end of the decade. And so it came to pass. For a couple of decades,much of humanity dared to believe our future did lie amid the stars. Thataspiration seems charmingly naive and innocent now, in this age ofever-diminishing global resources, looming environmental catastrophe, and inflagging belief in our own capabilities, reflected in our diminished imaginationabout what the future can be.With the end of the shuttle program, NASA seems to epitomize this uncertainty;indeed, some would say that it lost its guiding vision (and justification forexistence) when the Apollo program ended in 1972. In this, the space agency isnot unlike the rest of America. As a people and a country, America has lost itsway; the future is no longer viewed as an uncharted vista, beckoning us with itspromise of exploration and discovery, but as a prospect of dread, as somethingto be feared and delayed as long as possible. In the current political andsocial climate, denial of the future has become pervasive; many political andcultural leaders now seek to return to some delusional golden age that neverexisted, some Reagan-era fantasy where it is again Morning in America. It is notgoing to happen, and it never has happened. America veered off course decadesago, though only now are we beginning to see the consequences of our lack ofvision. The future is not only coming, it’s already here. And I am concernedthat we are facing it not as a challenge, but as a threat.Although Kennedy’s challenge to America was inspiring and certainly stimulatedmuch technological change, I can’t shake a feeling it was fundamentally flawed.I believe it reflected a failure to understand the impact of imagination on theunfolding of history. Kennedy’s vision appealed to a kind of chest-beatingpatriotic fervor about America and its greatness, but what were its practicalbenefits? We did go to the moon and back, repeating the trick several times. Wealso collected a lot of rocks and learned a lot about our technological limits.But beyond that, what did we gain? Certainly not the extraterrestrial footholdthat many intuit to be the next step in human destiny.In fact, we achieved nothing even close to that until three decades later, whenthe first piece of the International Space Station was launched in 1998. The ISShas garnered much less attention than the Apollo program. The space station maynot be as inspiring or as sexy as the lunar program, but it is potentially farmore significant. I have often wondered how different the twenty-first centurymight have been if Kennedy had given careful thought to the real goals of spaceexploration. What if he had called for a permanent manned space station insteadof a lunar program whose consequences were pretty much limited to proving that,yes, ’Merica could do it? If Kennedy had made such an orbital base the country’sgoal, we now might be mining asteroids for the bulk of our water and minerals,generating all of the world’s energy from solar-power satellites, andmaintaining bases on the moon, possibly on Mars, and even in orbit around theouter planets. Instead he chose machismo over substance, threw down atechnological gauntlet to the Russians, and pushed the Cold War to furtherheights of hostility.Hindsight, of course, is always sharper than foresight. But our lack of clarityin understanding the significance of space exploration, not only for humanitybut for earthly life, represents one of those bifurcations in the time-streamthat will have serious consequences for the survival of our species and thelarger biosphere. My fear is that we’ve reached that fork and taken the wrongbranch. As a result, the future before us is not one of colonizing the solarsystem and eventually spreading earthly life throughout the galaxy. Instead,what we confront is an era of dwindling resources, ever more repressivepolitical systems, the rising hegemony of know-nothing fundamentalism, and theaccelerating contamination of our planet as we lurch toward a tipping-point thatcould destabilize the homeostatic feedback mechanisms that have kept Earthhospitable to life for the last 3.9 billion years. Ironically, we face theprospect of drowning in our own waste even as many deny that what is piling uparound us is waste.I’m quite sure that the actions we take—or fail to take—over the next decadewill be critical for the continued existence of earthly life. I also believethat in fifty years we’ll look back and realize we made the wrong choices. Wewill have also failed to construct an escape hatch. I doubt this will mean anabrupt end to life here, although it could. But instead of remaining an islandof life for millions of years, Earth will remain livable for at most a fewcenturies. We could still avert that fate if we woke up, but the chances of thatlook rather dismal. My fear is that it is too late to change course.Fifty years of manned spaceflight is a tiny slice of time when we’re consideringevolutionary processes that have played out over eons. Whether we’ll ever raftour species and other life forms beyond the planetary surface remains to beseen. Though our tentative efforts to date may not prevail, perhaps others will.As a Big Picture person, I find some consolation in the belief that our world isnot the only place where this grand experiment is underway. Life surelypermeates the cosmos, and though our pathetic steps may fall short, otherselsewhere will someday succeed. Still, it’s a cold comfort here on earth,particularly for those with children. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 11 - First Loves: 1962 In the fall of 1961, at age ten, I started fifth grade at Paonia Junior HighSchool, leaving behind Paonia Elementary and its undemanding teachers. Some ofthem were the archetypal “sweet old ladies,” others were kind of scary, and afew were slightly nuts. I had a lasting tie to my first school through Mrs.Mordica, a beloved first-grade teacher who lived alone in a tiny house acrossthe street from ours. Years after I had moved away, I would stop by and sayhello to her on my holiday visits. By then I must have looked pretty scarymyself with my thick beard and long hair. That didn’t matter to Mrs. Mordica,who I always felt could see past appearance and judge us by our souls. One yearI returned and learned that she’d passed on. I can hardly imagine all she musthave witnessed in her life, and the knowledge that died with her.In fifth grade I met a new set of teachers, but the old pattern held: some weregood and some were not. I was still deeply into the Catholic religion at thetime, but over the years ahead I’d learn there were different kinds of priestsas well.I was what some called a “good doggon,” meaning a faithful Catholic whoregularly goes to mass and confession. My father was a good doggon, too. Thoughnot a Catholic at first, my mother eventually joined the church and always hadthe mindset. She even taught catechism; I was in her class. I was also an altarboy. Living a block or so from the church, I was regularly tapped to serve earlymorning mass on weekdays. I hated being rousted out of bed at 6:30 to get ready,especially on icy winter mornings. The only other people there were the two oldwomen who maintained the sacristy, setting out the priest’s vestments, thecommunion wafers, the ciborium, and the wine, in preparation for mass. Theyseemed incredibly ancient to me, wrinkled and bent over, invariably wearingscarves, like the peasant women from Eastern Europe I’d seen pictured in theBook of Knowledge. I regarded them as just part of the furnishings, like thestatues or the crucifix over the altar.It was a small parish, and the priests didn’t have a lot to do, so at times I’dhang out with them on summer afternoons. Some were interesting, othersforbidding. Some were probably also alcoholics, though that’s a guess. The firstpriest I remember, Father McGrath, was by far the scariest. He was an Irishmanwho lived in the rectory with his elderly mother. Lacking any sense of humor, hehad a rather dour outlook on life, and on little boys in particular. To him,almost everything was a mortal sin, but especially masturbation and impurethoughts, as he often told me so in a rumbling, gravelly brogue like the voiceof doom: “It is a moooortal sin, Dennis!” It never occurred to me that I mightjust discontinue the practice; instead I learned to live with the guilt. I wasrelieved when Father McGrath got shipped off. I was still a horrible person, butat least he wasn’t around to remind me of it. His replacement, Father Hickey,was also an Irishman, but a basically nice guy who didn’t seem to think less ofme when I confessed my various thought crimes. I had to wonder what he missed.The Cuban Missile Crisis occurred at the height of my involvement with thepriests and the church. The conflict began in mid-October 1962 when an Americanspy plane spotted new bases in Cuba being built for an arsenal of Soviet nuclearmissiles. The Soviets must have felt justified in parking their weapons so nearthe American mainland after the United States had placed similar ones in Europe,within striking distance of Moscow. The two-week confrontation pitted Kennedy,the young, untested president, against Nikita Khrushchev, the wily, experiencedgeopolitical strategist; it ended when both leaders agreed to a secret dealbrokered by United Nations Secretary-General U Thant. In return for the Sovietsdismantling their systems in Cuba, the Americans lifted their naval blockade,vowed not to invade Cuba, and secretly agreed to deactivate their missiles inItaly and Turkey.During the fifties, we’d grown used to living in the shadow of nuclearholocaust. Its apparent inevitability created an anxiety that permeated theculture, much as the threat of terrorism does today. Many families built bombshelters in the back yard (though we never went that far) even as the nationbecame numb to the notion that the world teetered, perpetually, on the nuclearbrink. The Missile Crisis made us realize, however, that mutually assureddestruction could actually happen; pushed to the wall, our leaders might just becrazy enough to blow up the world. In my belief that the end could not beaverted, I calmly prepared to die. I had accumulated quite a few sins and wantedto get my account cleared before I departed. Fortunately, the priest at the timewas Father Hickey. When I showed up at the rectory and asked for confession hewas happy to provide it, but he also tried to comfort me, saying that he didn’tbelieve the two leaders would come to nuclear blows, and that if it came to thatGod himself would intervene to stop it. What else could he say? Then again, forall anyone knows, maybe God did.Later came Father Dan, who at first seemed pretty cool. He actually had a degreein engineering and had worked on construction projects before becoming a priest.He was a big, bearish guy, and the altar boys loved him. It turned out he alsoloved the altar boys—a little too much. He took us on trips to explore the ghosttowns around Telluride and swim in the hot springs at Ouray, where he gave uspiggyback rides in the pool. He was known to ask inappropriate questions, pryingfor salacious details when we’d confess our struggles with the usualpre-pubescent temptations. Word of that got out among the young people,including some girls, and we came to realize that Father Dan was a little bittwisted.My own encounter with him in this regard happened when I confided in him aboutmy ticklishness. I wanted to overcome it because, as I’ve mentioned, Terenceoften used tickling to torture me. Father Dan suggested he could help, and tookme down into the rectory basement and made me disrobe. Then he started touchingme all over, assuring me that I could cure my ticklishness if I learned to“relax.” It wasn’t much of a molestation; it was more like a massage. He didn’ttouch my genitals, but he saw enough to tell me that, yes, I was indeedcircumcised. Was I “traumatized” by this treatment? Actually, I wasn’t. I was soclueless about sexual matters that it never even occurred to me that I was beingmolested, though of course I was. And I trusted him completely. I was well intomy twenties when, after hearing of reports of a sexual abuse scandal involvingthe church, I thought: So that’s what was going on!What is it about priests and pedophilia? Church officials would like to blamethe trend on a few bad apples, but I think it’s much more common than they’llever admit. The idiotic celibacy rule undoubtedly contributes to the problem.Being a priest must be a very lonely job. They are expected to counsel peopleabout their most intimate matters, including sexual matters, and yet with rareexceptions they have no experience with sex, relationships, family life, or anyof that. I think it twists their personalities in many cases, but not all. I’veknown and learned from priests who never laid a hand on me—decent sorts likeFather Hickey, and a few good conversationalists with sharp Jesuit minds. Asalways it comes down to the individual. Nevertheless, I no longer have any usefor the Catholic Church. It is corrupt through and through, as far as I can see,particularly regarding the abuse issue and the cover-ups associated with it. Itmakes me sick every time I see the pope making some pronouncement on sexuality,gays, abortion, birth control, priestly marriage, or “proper” moral conduct. Tohave a claim to moral authority, you have to be moral. As a nest of pedophiles,the church long ago sacrificed any legitimate claim to that. The sooner itcollapses under the weight of its own rot, the better.Partly because of these early influences, and partly thanks to Terence, whodespised Catholicism even more than I do, I’ve lost respect for virtually allorganized religions. While they may have addressed the spiritual needs of peopleat some point in history, they are now largely political institutions that usetheir false authority and threats of eternal damnation to bludgeon people intoconformity and silence. Who needs them? Given the four-year gap between our births, Terence and I were never studentstogether in the same school. In a town where the primary and secondary schoolsystems were divided into four-year terms, I started junior high in 1961 just asTerence, then fourteen, moved on to high school. Being very much in Terence’sshadow, I probably benefited from this separation, which gave me a chance tostand on my own among my peers. I’m not sure what would have happened otherwise.Terence might have been protective of me, his little brother; or he might havepiled on with older kids to make my life harder. I certainly would have beenviewed as “Terry McKenna’s brother,” but since no other student in PJHS had beenin Terence’s class, I had no reputation to defend. The teachers were a differentstory. With his exceptional intelligence and aggressiveness, Terence had been ontheir radar, and some surely had developed a dislike for him. Then again, otherscould see there was something special about him, despite how obnoxious he couldbe at times.Quieter and more easygoing, I must have been a pleasant surprise to the teacherswho had survived Terence. Though I was shy and well behaved, a kid who kept hislight under a hat, some teachers discerned that I too was intelligent—and that Ioften judged myself in comparison to my more flamboyant brother. They encouragedme to be myself and not imitate Terence, and even today I remain grateful fortheir efforts to help me find my own path. One of them was Mrs. Campbell, fromwhom I took courses in both fifth and sixth grade. Mrs. Campbell and herhusband, Cal, a science teacher, were really my first academic mentors. Mrs.Campbell had also taught Terence and may well have become fed up with him. Or soTerence believed, having often come home to report, “Mrs. Campbell despises me.”She was kind to me, however, and we had a couple of heart-to-heart discussionswhose drift was that I stop trying to be like Terence. This was easier said thandone at a time when I still worshipped my big brother. I do think she helped medevelop enough self-esteem to realize I was as smart as Terence, but different.Fifth grade was also the year I became aware of my own sexuality, or rather,that such feelings could be directed toward other people. Until then, my eroticactivities were solitary and sometimes aided by the “men’s magazines” that myfather occasionally brought home from his trips and hid (not very well) in hissuitcase. At the time, my nascent sexual identity was ambiguous. I wasdefinitely attracted to the opposite sex, but like many males I went through aphase where I wasn’t sure whether I was drawn to my own gender or not. In fact,it took a few years and some “close encounters” before I understood that I wasstraight. Why even discuss this? Well, for one thing, I believe it’s normal forboys to wonder about, and come to terms with, their sexual identities. MostAmericans now accept that being homosexual is no cause for shame. Fifty yearsago, however, it was still regarded as a deep, dark, scandalous secret to beconcealed at all costs. I agree with most current informed opinion on childdevelopment that, with possible rare exceptions, one is born homosexual, orheterosexual, and that the main determinants are genetic. Homosexuality is aningrained biological trait, not a choice, unlike what certain fundamentalistmoralists would have us believe. That said, it is not unusual for the young todabble in homosexual urges or even activity in that period before sexualidentity has solidified.I mention this in light of what may have been my first “love,” though, if so, itwas distinctly platonic. In a roundabout way, I can thank Mrs. Campbell for myencounter with Gerard as well. She was somehow related to a family from Chilewho spent that year living with her. I’m not sure which if either of Gerard’sparents was actually Chilean, let alone what led them to Paonia; I do know hewas their only child. As fellow fifth-graders we had some classes together, andI soon became completely obsessed. Gerard was the most exotic creature I’d everseen. It was his foreignness that fascinated me—a boy from a faraway land,better educated, more polite, and more mature than my uncouth peers. He dressedwell and spoke well. He had a very pale complexion and dark lashes. He mighthave grown up to be gay for all I know, but I saw no hint of this, and would nothave known what to look for anyway. He was to my mind the very paradigm ofsophistication, and I aspired to be like him, if possible, since I could notactually be him. Though my attraction wasn’t overtly sexual, at some subliminallevel I suppose it was, even if such emotions never penetrated my consciousawareness. In fact, for much of his stay we had no relationship; I was much tooshy. We eventually developed a tentative friendship, though I never let on howcompletely smitten I was. By the end of the school year, he and his parents weregone. We kept in touch for a while, our letters growing more infrequent untilour correspondence faded away.With the arrival of fall and the start of sixth grade, Gerard was all butforgotten in favor of other crushes, this time on those wonderful, exotic, andscary creatures, girls! Not that I had much luck or confidence with them. Mynext obsession was Liz, a lovely blonde. Her family had recently moved to Paoniaand ended up in my grandfather’s house, joining a series of tenants who hadrented the place since his death a few years earlier. That she lived just a halfblock away only intensified my longing. I had a job at the time delivering theDaily Sentinel, published in Grand Junction and trucked up to Paonia everynight. Dropping the paper at Liz’s house was the highlight of my route; therewas always the chance I’d see her hanging out on the porch swing. And when I didsee her, in all her lissome, long-legged loveliness, it would keep me charged upfor days. I could literally think of nothing else and lived in a perpetual stateof unrequited longing. Besides being attracted, I was also terrified and had noidea how to convey what I felt. I invested great effort in pretending to beindifferent, fearing I’d say or do some foolish thing that would blow my cover.I don’t know whether she was ever aware of how I felt. This was the first time Iwas “head over heels” in love, an intense state bordering on pathology. Thougherotic obsession is by no means normal, it is a state that most of us long for.Indeed, I feel sorry for those who have never been overwhelmed by such desire,even though it is a kind of exquisite torture, especially if those emotions arenot returned.After the school year ended, Liz and her family moved away, leaving meheartbroken, for about a week. It didn’t take long before I found another girlto obsess over. My third debilitating crush also remained a secret, though asecret I kept less well. Rosalie, the daughter of a local coal miner, was apretty brunette. She also happened to be Catholic, so I got the double charge ofseeing her in school and in church. I’m sure she was a nice Catholic girl, whichdidn’t stop me from routinely entertaining sexual fantasies about her while Iwas supposedly praying. I was no less terrified of Rosalie than of my earliercrushes, and I was too shy to say much beyond a few murmured pleasantries. Tosay more might have revealed what I was really thinking and wanting, or so Ifeared. But I couldn’t forever keep those feelings to myself. I decided to writeher an anonymous letter, which I did—and immediately regretted sending themoment I dropped it in the mail. I was mortified. Then I realized in mynervousness I’d forgotten to put a stamp on it. I’d been saved! I allowed myselfto believe the letter never reached her. Thinking back on life in our smalltown, I now guess it probably did reach her, and that poor Rosalie was eithertoo appalled or too kind to let on that it arrived. Or maybe she really didn’tknow who had sent it.It’s strange to think back on these ancient episodes of puppy love and theanxiety and guilt and longing and fear they caused in me. Being in love, atleast at that age, on the cusp of puberty, was a kind of mental illness thatrendered me dysfunctional for months. Outwardly, I was fine; I did my homework,went to school, and behaved more or less normally. But in truth I was like azombie, just going through the motions. My real life, my inner life, waspreoccupied with the bittersweet contemplation of my beloved—bittersweet becausethe object of my desires knew nothing, and could know nothing, about feelings Iwas afraid to express. Later, of course, I’d have relationships that were moremature in that they led to actual connection and communication, evenconsummation, but they too could bring anxiety and frustration. I suppose allthis is completely within the range of normality, and that almost everyone hassimilar experiences as they grow up. Not that crossing the threshold intoadulthood makes it any easier. If anything, love only becomes more complicatedand problematic. Being “in love” is an altered state, as much or more than anystate induced by a psychoactive drug. With its radical and prolonged shifts inhormone balances and neurotransmitter fluxes, reflected in behavioral andcognitive responses, the neurophysiology of love is a rich area for exploration,as neuroscience is discovering.In a simpler sense, it’s strange to think back upon those young, lovely girlsand realize they’re now nearing old age, as I am. What have they felt andexperienced over the past decades, what grief and joy? It’s hard to imagine. Ihope that life has been kind to them. I wish all of them well, and thank themfor what they meant to me, even if they never knew it. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 12 - The California Crusade While I was discovering the joys and frustrations of unrequited love in thesixth grade, Terence was in tenth grade and already plotting his breakout. Atsome point the year before, he’d resolved to get out of stifling, conservativePaonia and finish high school in California while living with Aunt Tress andUncle Ray. Since then, he’d spared no effort to convince our parents to let himgo. Most people with such an agenda would have tried to be extra nice, to usecharm and persuasion to bring their parents around to seeing the merits of theidea. This was not Terence’s style. Instead, he amped up his usual, steadydrumbeat of obnoxious behavior, and why not? That had always worked before.He single-mindedly pursued this campaign throughout his sophomore year. Therewas a new math teacher at the school whom I’ll call RJ. RJ was an unconventionalsoul, or what was known as a “beatnik” back then, before the invention ofhippies. He was a smart person, a bachelor, kind of pudgy, straight, harmless,perhaps lonely and insecure. But he’d read a lot of books and had many funnyideas—meaning liberal ideas. He did not fit into the red-meat, gung-ho,sports-obsessed culture of Paonia High School any more than Terence did, andthey immediately recognized each other as kindred spirits. Despite RJ’s basicdecency, our parents, especially my father, were quite suspicious of Terence’sfriendship with him. I don’t know what his concern was, beyond not wantingTerence to be exposed to his unconventional ideas. It was the non-intellectual’sdistrust of the egghead. RJ was also the art teacher, and he worked with Terenceon various projects, like an eight-by-four foot mural in the style of JacksonPollock—“Looks like somebody spilled a bunch of paint and then rolled in it,”grumbled our father—that Terence insisted on hanging in our bedroom.Our parents’ disapproval was a red flag for Terence, who spent as much time aspossible with RJ as a convenient way of irritating them. The other prong in hisoffensive, the one that probably broke them, began when he started pursuing thedaughter of the local librarian. She was a nice girl about two years older thanTerence, but because of the age difference she might as well have been the Whoreof Babylon as far as our father was concerned. He became convinced that Terencewas going to “knock her up.” This possibility was seen as the worst possibleoutcome, and it had to be thwarted. I doubt my brother and his friend ever hadsex, as later events seemed to confirm; but I suspect Terence wanted our Dad tothink that they were. Today, more liberal parents might address such a situationby discussing condoms or birth control with their son. In our Catholic, sexuallyrepressed family fifty years ago, the mere idea of birth control was a heresythat could not be raised in rational conversation. In those days, if you got agirl pregnant, you married her, and that effectively ended your life.In the spring of 1963, in the middle of this campaign, Dad suffered his firstand only heart attack. I suspect today it might be viewed as a mild one, but anyheart attack then was considered serious, a brush with death. Dad spent a lot oftime recuperating in bed, a common mode of treatment at the time. He also gaveup the unfiltered Camels he’d been smoking since the war, which did not help hismood. You’d think if your father had just suffered a heart attack, perhapscaused in good measure by the stress of dealing with you, his recalcitrant son,you might ease up a little and cut the guy some slack. Yet, as I recall, Terenceraised the pressure even higher. Finally our parents relented; Terence got theirpermission to go. In the end, I think, my mother was worried that if he stuckaround, there was a good chance he’d upset my father enough to trigger anotherheart attack. Once again Terence had gotten his way, as he always did, bypressing so hard they finally caved in.That’s how, in the fall of 1963, Terry ended up attending Awalt High School inMountain View, California, with our cousin Kathi. (The school was renamedMountain View High in the early 1980s.) He had soon befriended a coterie ofstrange and interesting people, some of whom went on to play a role in both ourlives. He also encountered an abundance of unconventional and even dangerousideas. Meanwhile, Terence’s departure meant enormous change for me at home. Hishabit of tormenting me had already diminished by then, partly because he’d foundother interests, and partly because I’d grown big enough to pose the risk I’dretaliate. Nevertheless, I was delighted to be suddenly free of all torture, andto have my own room to boot! At the same time, I was sad to see him go, becausehe always had enough stuff going on to keep things interesting.A seventh grader, I’d been left to my own devices, which included astronomy,cosmology, and astrophysics. I’d eventually abandon my ambitions in those fieldsas I grew to realize I couldn’t cut the math, though looking back I think Icould have succeeded if I’d stuck with it. What seemed then to be aninsurmountable barrier was an early factor in directing my aspirations towardbiology. I was also into classical music. I was a snob about pop music at thetime; it took a year or so of Terence’s influence on visits back from the WestCoast to make me appreciate the virtues of rock and roll and folk music. My herowas the classical guitarist Andrés Segovia. At one point, my parents let me takethe bus alone to visit a friend whose family had moved to Phoenix the yearbefore. Segovia was giving a concert at Arizona State University, and seeing himin person was a highlight of my young life. I wanted to be either the world’snext best classical guitar player or a conductor like Leonard Bernstein. Asdirector of the New York Philharmonic, Bernstein hosted a series of televisionspecials, called the Young People’s Concerts, that I loved. I was all over thosebroadcasts as much as any space shot.Though life was better at home, my relationships at school were deteriorating. Inever had a lot of friends in junior high; I suppose I was too weird for many ofmy peers, or too “nerdy” as we’d say now. I was a bookish fellow with eclecticinterests that few of my fellow students shared. And that was fine with me. Ihad plenty to keep me occupied and didn’t feel the need of a large social group.I had a few close friends who either tolerated my eccentricities or wereeccentric as well.But for a while that year, a certain group of boys took it upon themselves tosingle me out for bullying. Most I considered “meatheads.” The exception wasRichard, one of my closest friends, so his involvement was all the more hurtfuland confusing. Like the others, he was a year ahead of me. He sometimes tried todefend me or persuade the others to leave me alone; but just as often he joinedin the taunting, which developed into a daily occurrence and quickly becameintolerable. Richard may have been insecure about his status—although why was amystery to me, as he was admired as an athlete and was attractive to girls. Inany case, I think he felt compelled to participate in the bullying as a way todemonstrate solidarity with his peers, and for that I don’t blame him. Seventhgrade seems to be a critical time in childhood when acceptance by the groupbecomes particularly important, and if acceptance requires one to displayloyalty to the “gang” by ostracizing another, so be it.This went on for weeks. It was my custom to walk the few blocks home for lunch,returning to school half an hour before the noon break ended. And there they’dbe, waiting. I hardly remember what if anything the harassment was about beyondsnide remarks about my sexuality, allusions that I was “queer” even though Iclearly wasn’t, snatching my glasses, hitting, poking, pulling on my clothes,silly things like that. Without really knowing what I was doing, except that theharassment had to be stopped, I did bring it all to an abrupt end one day. A kidnamed Sheldon often led the proceedings. My tormentors usually greeted me when Ireturned, forming a kind of gauntlet I’d have to run up the front steps into thebuilding. While they seldom pursued me beyond that point, this time Sheldonblocked my path, standing on the top steps in front of the double doors withtheir large plate-glass windows. Though I was cornered, by then I’d had enough.I gave Sheldon a push, a rather gentle push, actually, but he lost his balanceand staggered back; I saw the cracks appear in the glass around a Sheldon-shapedimpression as the heavy glass shattered and he fell through. There was a momentof stunned silence. Imagine the tableau: Sheldon on his back amid a pile ofshattered glass, me standing over him shaking with rage, the others paralyzed atthe foot of the stairs, appalled at what had happened. The freeze-frame lastedonly a second; time started to flow again as I turned toward them and screamed,“Just leave me alone, all I want is to be left alone!” Or something lame likethat.Before we knew it we were all sitting in the office of the school principal. Mr.Etherton was a cool guy, actually, well liked and rather easygoing. Though hehad known about the bullying for some time, he’d made no effort to intervene.This was his chance. Things were quickly sorted out, blame was laid (on all ofus, including me) and justice dispensed: All parties had to avoid each other,and all had to chip in to repair the window. The first condition worked; theharassment ended. As for the second, I was never asked to help pay for thewindow, nor were my tormentors, as far as I know.Ironically, some of these older guys became my best friends in high school. Bythen the hippie meme had arrived, and suddenly I was cool, having gotten myhands on some cannabis and turned them on. Strong friendships were forged on ourmutual interest in novel and prohibited intoxicants. While a few of those bondshave persisted to this day, over the years some of us drifted apart, and somehave passed away. As for my nemesis, Sheldon, he wasn’t part of that group, butwe left each other alone. He wanted to be a lawyer, if I recall. I don’t know ifhe achieved his ambitions, but I think he would have made a great prosecutor.I can’t conclude my remembrance of seventh grade without mentioning Madeline.She was a special friend of a quite different order than the other girls Ilonged for and lusted over at that age. Though she was perhaps more beautifulthan they were, and certainly smarter, our relationship remained platonic,except for one abortive effort during my first summer back from the Universityof Colorado in Boulder. We both realized then that an amorous relationship wasnot to be our fate, though at times I’ve regretted that. In many ways we weresoul mates. What we shared was a love of books and ideas, and that gave usplenty to talk about, even as it separated us from most of our peers. We were“extra-environmental,” a term coined by the media theorist Marshall McLuhan todescribe someone who is in a culture but not of it, like an anthropologistliving with some exotic tribe. Both introverts, we came to see ourselves askindred spirits trapped in a milieu of meatheads, jocks, and “mean girls.” Weweren’t part of the cool cliques, and didn’t care; we took pride in ourextra-environmental status and cultivated a bemused detachment from the gamesthat shaped the social dynamics among our peers. Sexual attraction didn’t comeinto it, and I really don’t know why.But I thank my lucky stars for Madeline. Our friendship made school life almosttolerable. She belonged to the little band of rebels that coalesced around me inhigh school, whose main preoccupation was the exploration of altered states ofconsciousness accessed through various pharmacological portals. The two of usremained close throughout high school and beyond, until we lost touch in theseventies. I know she moved away; I may have heard that she’d married a teacher,or perhaps had become a teacher herself. I haven’t seen her in many years, butshe lives on, fondly, in memory. The biggest trauma that school year occurred far from school. Kennedy’sassassination on November 22, 1963, exploded onto the global stage, throwing thecountry into a paroxysm of shock and horror. Though Terence was in California,both he and I were similarly affected, as a letter to me revealed. How couldthis vibrant, handsome president who symbolized hope and progress for so many,including us, be gunned down by a madman with a cheap, mail-order rifle? It wastoo much. Such a thing could not happen in a sane and rational world, only in aworld under the sway of dark and sinister forces. Or at least that’s how wefelt. America’s age of innocence was over, and in many ways, so was ours.Along with the rest of the country, we did little in the following days exceptstare at the television as the grim spectacle unfolded: Oswald, the allegedassassin, shot as he was led from his cell in Dallas; Kennedy’s body lying instate in the Capitol rotunda as the silent crowds shuffled past; the funeralcortege, the riderless horse, the burial at Arlington National Cemetery; all thefutile pomp and effort to bind the wound where a country’s heart had been rippedout. It’s been said that the idealism of a generation died with Kennedy, but theAmerica that shaped our idealism may have died as well. As I look back, itappears increasingly certain that none of what was lost then will ever berecovered—not our hope, our optimism, or our direction. Though the country’sfortunes have since gone through many apparent ups and downs, in retrospect thathalf-century looks more like a steady devolution, an unraveling, as we spiralinevitably toward some unknown outcome. A country cannot foresee its fate inworld history, of course, but it’s gotten harder for me to envision ours with ahappy ending.Many people have remarked that they sense time is somehow accelerating, or thatmore and more events are being crammed into less and less time. That wascertainly how it felt as the dark days of late 1963 gave way to a new year. Therhythm of current events seemed to be picking up, and so did the pace ofpersonal events. The latter may have been an illusion, or just a matter of beingolder with more to do, but nonetheless, over the next few years our own livesfelt as if they were moving ever faster.In January 1964, President Lyndon Johnson used his first State of the Unionaddress to announce his “War on Poverty.” In February, the Beatles arrived fortheir inaugural U.S. tour and dominated pop radio with a string of hits. Springbrought the first Rolling Stones album, the first student protests against theVietnam War, and the first draft-card burnings. In July, Johnson signed theCivil Rights Act of 1964, outlawing segregation, and Barry Goldwater, theRepublican presidential nominee, famously stated, “extremism in the defense ofliberty is no vice.” In August, Congress passed the Tonkin Gulf Resolution,which allowed the president to wage war in Southeast Asia without having thatwar actually declared. By year’s end, American troops in South Vietnam numbered23,300. Johnson beat Goldwater in the November elections, Martin Luther King,Jr. won the Nobel Peace Prize, and comedian Lenny Bruce was sentenced to fourmonths in the workhouse for using offensive language at a New York club.A wider debate over what could and could not be said in public had erupted thatfall at the University of California, Berkeley. Known as the Free SpeechMovement, or FSM, it began in September when UC officials decided to enforce along-ignored rule against leafleting and recruiting for various off-campuspolitical concerns on university property. Civil rights and the war were twosuch concerns, but the ban curtailed conservative activities as well. A seriesof rallies ensued, including a massive sit-in that led to the arrest ofhundreds. Terence, then a high school senior, closely followed those events inBerkeley, which later had a profound if indirect affect on him—and on me aswell.In what might be termed “drug news” of the day, in 1964 Congress recognizedbourbon whiskey (our father’s drug of choice, though he never acknowledged itwas a drug) as “a distinctive product of the United States.” The Catholic churchcondemned the female contraceptive pill. The novelist Ken Kesey embarked on thedecade’s strangest book tour, aboard a painted bus with his fellow MerryPranksters, a trip later recounted by Tom Wolfe in The Electric Kool-Aid AcidTest. Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner, and Richard Alpert published The PsychedelicExperience, a tripper’s guide loosely based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead. BobDylan turned the Beatles on to cannabis.By then, drugs were just beginning to seep into our personal sphere. At AwaltHigh in Mountain View, Terence had met some of the friends who figured soimportantly during his Berkeley years and beyond, and who may have introducedhim to marijuana as Bob had the Fab Four. But drugs had not become a majorpreoccupation for either of us. My involvement with drugs at the time was nil,and my interest even less. We were shown “drug education” films in schoolassemblies like Reefer Madness, which even then were three decades out of date.While that film is now viewed largely as a spoof, we were expected to take itseriously, and we did. The scare tactic worked. I couldn’t imagine any reasonwhy I would ever smoke that evil weed, ever. Not that it was an option; as faras I knew, there was no marijuana to be had within a hundred miles, althoughthere were probably a few beatniks and bohemians in Aspen who were smoking it.In my universe, marijuana did not exist.In the spring of 1964, my guess is Terence was far more concerned with sex thandrugs. Getting laid, I think, was one of life’s milestones he was determined toput behind him. Predictably, there was a scandal, the details of which remainsketchy to me. According to my aunt, a sixth-grade teacher at the time, one ofTerence’s female classmates was a former student of hers. That young woman’smother, who I’ll call Mrs. Z, apparently had a taste for inexperiencedteenagers, and it didn’t take long before Terence got on her radar. There were anumber of parties and encounters that spring, according to my aunt. She and myuncle frowned on this, perhaps having prior knowledge of the woman’sproclivities. At any rate they forbade Terence to see her, but of course heignored them and continued going over to her house. The deed must have occurredat one of these clandestine meetings, because, as my aunt later related, Terencecame home one night in an agitated state, perhaps intoxicated, and took severalshowers in a row. This suggests to me that perhaps the union had beenconsummated, and the emotional impact was more than he’d bargained for.A huge fight ensued. According to my aunt, my brother’s defiant act was the laststraw in a series of conflicts with his temporary guardians. Since the schoolyear was all but over, they announced they’d had enough: Terence would not bewelcomed back in the fall for his senior year. My aunt and uncle drove him hometo Paonia when they returned for their summer stay at Chair Mountain Ranch.Terence was quite agitated the entire trip; harsh and hurtful words wereexchanged by both sides. As if that wasn’t bad enough, Mrs. Z, the seductress,also drove to Paonia to “rescue” Terence, possibly by taking him to Californiaor absconding with him elsewhere. I don’t know how all this finally ended,except that Terence never did return to Awalt High. In fact, there must havebeen a concerted effort to protect me from this melodrama, because I was barelycognizant of it then and only learned about it when I interviewed my aunt forthis book. I did know, however, that the episode, whatever it was, created arift between Terence and my aunt and uncle that was never resolved. Terencedeleted them from his universe. His reaction was much like that toward ourfather after Terence was caught doing something naughty in the sandbox and wasbeaten at age three or four. Before and after the falling out with Tress andRay, forgiveness was not apparent in Terence’s nature.It is a pity, really, because it meant he slammed the door on an entire segmentof our family—including the cousins we’d grown up with during those long summerson the ranch. My aunt and uncle made several attempts to reestablish ties withTerence, but their efforts were rebuffed. In fact, the next time he had contactwith our aunt was in the spring of 2000, only days before he passed on. In thosefinal, heart-wrenching days, he was paralyzed, unable to speak; I was with himat the time. In what may have been a misguided attempt to bring some healing, Icalled my aunt and held the phone to Terence’s ear. I don’t know what was said,or if it comforted Terence or not. I hope it did. In this awkward situation Iwas trying, clumsily perhaps, to heal a rift that should have been healeddecades earlier, and this wasn’t the first time I’d made such an effort. In myrole as Little Brother, I often found myself reluctantly trying to clean up“messes” resulting from Terence’s conflicts with our parents. From what I couldtell, once you got on his shit list, you stayed there; there was no going back.This dynamic was a constant throughout Terence’s life and, in my opinion,negatively affected his relationships with many people, including our parentsand many of his lovers and friends.As I have said, Terence seemed not to have an empathetic bone in his body; andyet that capacity was there somewhere. Although he seemed to have cut himselfoff emotionally from our parents, I later realized he still loved them. I sawthat in the spring of 1964 when we learned our mother had breast cancer.Treatments were crude in those days, as they are still, and such a diagnosis wastantamount to a death sentence. The doctors performed a mastectomy and startedradiation treatments. We were told there was a fifty-fifty chance the cancerwould go into remission. If so, and if the cancer did not recur for at leastfive years, that would be interpreted to mean she was cancer free. When we gotthis news, five years seemed like an eternity, an abstraction that paled besidethe shock of realizing our mom might die within months. I was “lucky” if you cancall it that; I was still at home to give her daily support and comfort (thoughwhether I rose to that challenge as I should have I can’t recall). For Terence,in California, the impact of the news was less immediate, but his reactionsurprised me. He undertook to send our mother a postcard every day until hereturned that summer. The cards said nothing of importance; they were generalexpressions of encouragement and love. But when they began to arrive every dayit was very moving, and I think it helped our mother immensely, just to know hereldest son cared enough to write. It helped her to realize that this headstrong,rebellious teenager who had done so much to hurt her over the years still lovedher, and chose to express it in this way. I was impressed as well.The summer following the Mrs. Z affair was tense around our house. In lettingTerence attend school in California, our parents had trusted him to actresponsibly, a trust he had breached. They would have been justified in tellingTerence he’d now have to finish high school in Paonia, but they didn’t do that.Terence continued to press for some other outcome. Common sense might have ledhim to be a little conciliatory, but he remained confrontational. Finally ourfather relented, again, and persuaded his old war buddy Truman to “take Terenceon” for his last year of high school. Truman and his wife Iris lived inLancaster, California, a community near Edwards Air Force Base about seventymiles north of Los Angeles. Truman had been a pilot in the war and still hadclose connections to the military, working in some capacity on the nearby base,if I recall. My father might have thought that a few months with a military manmight be good for Terence. In fact, if the goal was to “reform” Terence or “makea man out of him,” so to speak, perhaps it was already too late for that.Terence spent his senior year at Antelope Valley High in Lancaster, a schoolwhose graduates included the musicians Frank Zappa and Don Van Vliet, betterknown as Captain Beefheart. His tenure there had its moments, but it wasn’t asbad as the year before at Awalt, at least from our parents’ perspective. By thenTerence had rejected all adult authority, including the kind that came fromfamily members or family friends like Truman and Iris. They were all impossiblylame and irrelevant in Terence’s view. It was Terence against the world; adultsand authority figures were the enemy. J. D. Salinger’s The Catcher in the Ryeand Ayn Rand’s manifestos influenced Terence’s thinking heavily at the time, andvalidated, for him, his anti-authoritarian stance as well as his belief that itwas perfectly OK to be totally selfish. In this respect, he wasn’t the firstheadstrong seventeen-year-old to feel this way. In the zeitgeist of the day,rejection of authority, particularly parental authority, was what you did. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 13 - The Experimental College: 1965 I’ve already admitted that when Terence first left Paonia I was happy to see himgo. I enjoyed my new status as an only child, feeling it might lead to moreattention from our parents. But it wasn’t long before I started to miss mybrother, the first signs of how our relationship would change. Over the next fewyears, Terence ceased to be the resident tormentor-in-chief; instead he becamemy absent mentor. And I was less the little brother to be alternately ignoredand harassed than a colleague and intellectual equal.In California, he met others every bit as “out there” as he was, an interestingbunch who presented new opportunities for mischief and outrage, but also forintellectual stimulation and growth. I had a chance to meet some of them ontheir summer visits, and a few became important influences for me as well.Terence and I discussed many of his newfound “funny ideas” in our occasionalcorrespondence and on his visits. Some of our common interests existed beforehe’d left, others we explored together after he’d been exposed to them andpassed them on. By then he’d realized, to his surprise, that I had my ownintellectual chops. I grew to look forward to his returns, knowing we’d engagein hours of engrossing conversation on topics utterly foreign to almost all mypeers. There was a certain smug satisfaction in knowing that we “knew stuff” noone else knew we knew.When Terence arrived at the University of California, Berkeley, for the fallsemester in 1965, he was still in full rebellion against those “authoritarianoppressors” who embodied everything he condemned. While he often lumped ourparents in that group, he was happy to let them pay for his college education—anethical dissonance that infuriated him when reminded of it, as my father made apoint of doing on Terence’s Christmas visit. I recall those confrontations asquite uncomfortable. Terence would accuse my parents of being fascists, a wordthat was often brandished thoughtlessly in those days, and in their case,unjustifiably. Our father never supported the war in Vietnam and was neverfooled by government doublespeak. Given that he’d risked his life to fight realfascism in World War II, my brother’s accusation struck me as offensive andunnecessary, but not surprising. Terence was always and ever the master of theprovocative statement, as those familiar with his work are well aware. Hefrequently said outrageous things just to get a response. Whether there was anytruth to his claims hardly mattered.But thanks to our parents’ tolerance, and our father’s checkbook, which remainedopen despite the insults and invective, Terence’s wish to begin his academiccareer at Berkeley had come true. As far he was concerned, he’d reached thePromised Land. Berkeley—or “Berzerkeley” as it was sometimes called in thoseheady times—had a longstanding reputation as a hotbed of radical ideas andsocial change. During the 1950s, the University of California made its employeestake an anti-communist loyalty oath, leading to charges of McCarthyism. Not onlywas Berkeley the epicenter of the protest movement and the burgeoningcounterculture, both of which Terence threw himself into, but also this time,for the first time, he’d escaped all adult supervision. Many of his high schoolfriends from Mountain View and Lancaster were fellow students at Berkeley;others migrated there just to be where the action was. The transition thus didlittle to disrupt his previous circle, which soon encompassed a broader set ofintelligent, interesting, wild-eyed characters. The staid conventions of thefifties were under full assault, and we all wanted to help bring down the oldorder, and usher in the new—though we had little idea what the “new” would looklike.The pressing issues of the day were Vietnam and civil rights. In early March1965, some 3,500 Marines had been sent to defend the American airbase in DaNang, becoming the first combat forces to arrive in Vietnam. On March 7, AlabamaState troopers violently blocked a peaceful crowd of 600 as it left Selma onfoot for Montgomery, a turning point in the civil rights movement remembered asBloody Sunday. Two weeks later, Martin Luther King tried again, leading anothermarch that reached its destination. In September, a reporter for the SanFrancisco Examiner, in a story on life in the Haight-Ashbury district, becameone of the first to use the term “hippie” in print.Writing in The Nation, Hunter S. Thompson examined Berkeley’s “nonstudent left,”that is, the growing numbers who were part of the local scene but not officiallytaking classes. In the wake of the Free Speech Movement, California had passed alaw that was supposed to keep outsiders from disrupting university affairs, butthe forces of change were everywhere. Draft-card burnings and Vietnam protestscontinued to grow in Berkeley and beyond, and many of the bands that generatedthe sounds of the psychedelic sixties had just been formed: The Grateful Dead,Jefferson Airplane, Velvet Underground, The Doors, Pink Floyd. By year’s end,Ken Kesey and company had begun staging the first LSD-driven “Acid Tests” in theBay Area. Timothy Leary’s prominence culminated in a bust for marijuanapossession in December as he tried to reenter the country from Mexico.The Free Speech Movement is worth a closer look, in light of its impact onTerence. As described earlier, the FSM coalesced in the fall of 1964, afteruniversity officials tried to curtail certain forms of political activity oncampus. In the first protest, a crowd surrounded a police car outside theadministration building, Sproul Hall, and trapped it there for more than a day.The protesters, led by student Mario Savio, Bettina Aptheker, and others,insisted the school was infringing on their right to political expression andassembly. Some were also demanding academic reforms at an institution lesscommitted to educating students, they said, than producing parts for a socialmachine shaped more and more by corporate interests. Events went critical inDecember when 2,000 students occupied Sproul Hall after officials said theyintended to punish four FSM organizers for their part in the disturbance twomonths earlier. Some time after midnight, Alameda County Deputy DistrictAttorney Edwin Meese III (later California Governor Ronald Reagan’s chief ofstaff, and later yet President Reagan’s attorney general) ordered the massarrests of “the 800” as they were known, though the actual count was slightlyless. A strike ensued, halting campus activity for a couple of days. In fact,the FSM’s demands were quite reasonable, and in early 1965 the university agreedto most of them, lifting the rules against political activity on campus.By the time Terence began classes, the FSM had all but ended, its immediategoals mostly realized. Campus activists had turned to reorganizing studentgovernment, forming a teaching assistant’s union, and investigating the tiesbetween academia, corporations, and the military that had become an issue theyear before. Many had turned their efforts against the Vietnam War. Thehistorical and cultural fallout from the FSM would linger for decades. Themovement remains a kind of model for student protest that is still emulated oncampuses today. And the steps of Sproul Hall are still a site for politicalharangues, a street-theater stage for every social movement from the far left tothe far right and everything in between. It’s democracy in action, the way it’ssupposed to work. A speech is now given every year in memory of Mario Savio, themost visible FSM leader, who died in 1996. His speeches in 1964 were crucial todefining the movement’s goals and galvanizing support for them among studentsand the faculty. The role of Twitter and Facebook during the Arab Spring, theOccupy Wall Street movement, and other events in 2011 suggest the power ofsocial media as a tool for democratic reform—but only as a tool. As for theretreat of many other causes largely into cyberspace, I doubt that’s to theirbenefit. The resulting lack of visibility removes them from the radar andaffords the so-called mainstream media a perfect excuse to minimize andmarginalize their coverage.Mainstream attention can have a downside as well, of course. Long after most ofthe FSM’s issues were resolved on campus, the inevitable backlash helped RonaldReagan get elected as California’s governor in 1966, on his promise to “clean upthe mess in Berkeley.” Clark Kerr, president of the UC system, was forced fromoffice in 1967 for allegedly being too soft on the protesters. A similar impactrippled out through the larger culture. While the ideals extolled by the FreeSpeech Movement continued to spread, so did a reaction against the widespreadflouting of conventional mores that appeared to accompany them. The sexual andpsychedelic revolutions, along with the strange music and exotic fashions thatthe young had adopted, all provoked a hostile response from the more rigidmembers of society, who convinced themselves that the very foundations ofcivilization were under threat.The FSM marked the historical genesis of what we now call the culture wars, thesplit between the country’s social conservatives and its liberals. The lines inthe sand have been drawn for decades, and indeed have deepened into trenchesfrom which activists on both sides lob their rhetorical salvos. Freedom ofspeech is alive and well in this country, thanks partly to the FSM;unfortunately, the spread of free speech doesn’t appear to be accompanied by aconcomitant increase in thoughtful listening (or thought of any kind), with theresult that political discourse has largely degenerated into a screaming matchbetween ideologues.That historical shockwave, and the polarization it triggered, were relativelynew when Terence arrived in Berkeley, fired up with rebellion, aflame with newideas, and surrounded by peculiar yet fascinating friends. As I said, he’d beenreading Ayn Rand, who ironically is now emblematic of a certain brand ofright-wing intellectualism inspired by her“me-first-and-everyone-else-be-damned” philosophy. Indeed, as a college freshmanTerence was very much caught up in the exercise of his own freedoms. I dare sayhe was also influenced by whatever drugs he’d gotten his hands on by then.(There were rumors of some kind of scandal involving either morning glory seedsor nutmeg during his senior year in Lancaster, but I was never told thedetails). In Berkeley, pot and LSD were easily had, Leary was urging the youngto turn on, and there was a great deal of ferment and curiosity aboutpsychedelics, fed by the Acid Tests and other “happenings,” not to mention thelive accompaniment provided by San Francisco’s trippy bands.Terence was spared a probable fate of being enlisted into some cause or movementby sheer good luck. Of the 27,000 students at UC Berkeley at the time, he wasone of 150 incoming freshmen admitted that year into the new ExperimentalCollege Program. Though plans for the program began before the Free SpeechMovement, many later mistook it for a response, given its intent to personalizethe learning experience at a huge school where students, especially new ones,could easily feel alone and alienated.Founded by Joseph Tussman, the chairman of the philosophy department, theexperimental college operated as a kind of university within the university. Theapproach was modeled on a similar experiment established in the 1920s byAlexander Meiklejohn, a thinker and free-speech advocate at the University ofWisconsin–Madison, where Tussman had been a student. Tussman’s program focusedon big questions and the periods of historical crisis that had catalyzedfundamental shifts in worldviews going back to ancient Greece. Students andfaculty gathered not in a classroom building but on the edge of campus, in ahouse. No grades were given; evaluations were based on intense dialogues withfaculty members and fellow students, and extensive, eclectic reading lists thatparticipants were encouraged to develop on their own.Academically, this was the best thing that could have happened to Terence; hewas ripe for something like this. The program also introduced him to others whowere similarly brilliant and passionate, in the way that only nineteen-year-oldscan be. Some of the friendships formed in that crucible lasted for years andfigured significantly in his later adventures.Recalling how Terence discussed the experience, I can see that Tussman was asignificant mentor for him. My brother immensely respected the man, who, as hisintellectual match in every way, challenged him to think critically and questionhis assumptions. Tussman did exactly what any smart philosophy professor trainedin Socratic dialogue would do: He dared Terence to think for himself. Did thefact that the man looked exactly like our father (or so Terence believed) haveanything to do with it? It’s hard to say, but I suspect so. On some level,Terence may have found in Tussman his intellectual father, one who respected himas a person and yet couldn’t be bamboozled. (That’s not to say our real fatherwas stupid, but that after a while he just gave up). The two-year Tussman cyclewas an extremely good maturation experience for my brother. Terence eventuallygraduated with a self-designed major in shamanic studies from the NaturalResources department, but in many ways the experimental college was the pinnacleof his academic life. It’s significant that Tussman’s program only lasted for acouple of cycles, ending in 1969.The program continued to enrich both our lives for another reason: It was therethat Terence discovered his talents as a bibliophile and a collector of rarebooks. Both of us had cherished and collected books from an early age, andTerry’s love of reading stimulated my desire to read. As a result, I had prettymuch mastered the art well before first grade. I thank Terence, and my own goodluck, for that. Reading is the skill most integral to an active life of themind. I am only happy that I’ve been able to pass on that love to my daughter, abookworm and an aspiring writer. Reading and loving to read is an inoculationagainst ignorance, which is on the rise again, I think, partly because peopletend to read much less now.In the pressure cooker of the Tussman program—just because it was unstructuredand ungraded didn’t mean there weren’t demands—Terence encountered a vastdiversity of ideas, from classic philosophy and Eastern religion to mediatheory. There he first studied Mircea Eliade, Edmund Husserl and thephenomenologists, and deepened his appreciation for the works of Carl Jung, whoin turn led him fatefully to the I Ching. He discovered the Western esoterictraditions and explored alchemy and black magic. He began to accumulate aserious book collection, spurred on by Tussman’s encouragement to explore everyavenue of interest, and by his own curiosity and passion. And he shared thesediscoveries with me. Once our geographical separation had brought us closer andfostered a new mutual respect, we corresponded fairly regularly. With Terence inthe thick of Berkeley’s intellectual and social ferment, I acutely felt myisolation. Getting a letter from him was like a castaway finding a message in abottle, a reassurance that beyond the stultifying confines of Paonia thereindeed existed an exciting world of ideas. I longed to escape as he had yearsbefore. Our extended discussions over his Christmas visits, along with the bookshe’d bring with him, provided plenty for me to chew on during his absences.In the fall of 1967, after completing his stint in the experimental college,Terence took off on his first world tour. Before leaving, he packed up hisentire library (by then well over a thousand volumes) and shipped it to me forsafekeeping. I was extraordinarily proud that he’d entrusted me to look afterhis books, and that he knew I’d appreciate them. Has ever an older brother givena younger brother a more meaningful gift? I can’t think of one. During thatyear, my junior year, which turned out to be my last in Paonia, I made everyeffort to devour as many of those books as I could. I made a fair dent, but Ididn’t read them all.Terence had a reputation for having a fantastic library, and it was. Or rather,both were. He assembled two major libraries during his lifetime, and had badluck with both of them. After he returned from his first global sojourn in thespring of 1968, that initial collection was shipped back to the Bay Area andstored in the family home of Terence’s best friend from the Tussman program,Michael. The books remained there in the Berkeley Hills until the summer of1970, when Terence was traveling again in Asia. It was a particularly drysummer, and wildfires swept the area, destroying many expensive homes, includingthat of Michael’s parents. Terence’s books were carried off as so much ash onthe hot winds.It took him thirty years to reproduce that wonder. His second library is the onethat has become part of the Terence McKenna legend. Following his death in 2000,his books and papers were given to the Esalen Institute in Big Sur. Afterconsiderable struggle I managed to ship them back from the Big Island of Hawaiiwhere Terence had been living before he passed on. Esalen’s curators temporarilystored the collection in an old building in downtown Monterey, awaiting theconstruction of a proper place for it on the Esalen campus. The century-oldstructure turned out to be a tinderbox. In early February 2007, a fire broke outin a sandwich shop on a lower floor, consuming a number of businesses, andTerence’s books, which were stowed above. Yet again, a priceless trove had beenreduced to ashes in a matter of minutes. The volumes included rare firsteditions of alchemical texts that existed nowhere else. It seemed almost like acurse, the curse of the Terence McKenna library! It was a terrible, terribletragedy—for Terence’s legacy, for Esalen, for our family, and for esotericbibliophiles everywhere.I was devastated when I heard the news. It was not only the loss of the library,which was bad enough, but it was also, for me, a final, forced letting go ofTerence. So much of him was embodied in his library. I felt that as long as itexisted, even if it was not within our family, his spirit lived on. Now thatspirit was gone forever, finally, irrevocably, utterly, destroyed and expungedfrom the earth. It was a shocking and painful thing. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 14 - Cannabis: 1966 The fall of 1965 marked a transition for me as well. As a freshman at PaoniaHigh School, I was once again sharing the halls with the older guys who hadharassed me in eighth grade, but they left me alone. My friendship with Richardhad survived despite his half-hearted alliance back then with my formertormentors. It wasn’t until the spring that I actually started hanging out withthose guys, some of whom were destined to become my partners in mischief wellinto the future. Madeline remained my closest friend, both of us too bookish andnerdy to fit in the other cliques, which worked out well. We didn’t want to bepart of those circles any more than they wanted us.While Terence was starting his first semester at Berkeley constructing hisintellectual foundations, I was stuck there in Paonia, a stranger in a strangeland—an introverted “extra-environmental” in my sweet and dearly loathedhometown. Paonia was, and is, a nice little community. It never had more than1,500 residents, and most lived on the outlying mesas. At times I’ve toyed withthe idea of moving back, only to realize the dream was impractical. During highschool, my attitude was less sentimental. I hated the place and wanted nothingmore than to escape. I was insanely jealous of Terence for pulling that off, andI thought I deserved no less. Many of my friends felt the same, though noteveryone made it out. Our nicknames for Paonia—“Peyote” or sometimes“Pissonya”—expressed our contempt. Tolkien’s popular Lord of the Rings trilogyprovided us with another epithet: Mordor, as in the accursed land of shadows andhome to evil sorcerer Sauron. A slight exaggeration, perhaps, but we wereteenagers and felt our angst palpably.Like it or not, Paonia was where I’d remain for the time being, and I still hadmany significant experiences there, being fifteen and eager for novelty andmischief. I also had Terence egging me on from a distance, always ready to leadme into the Next Big Thing.That school year marked the true start of my pharmacological education, whichhas been ongoing ever since. The scare movies I’d seen in junior high weresupposed to convince us that smoking marijuana even once would lead toaddiction, madness, and promiscuity (we wished!). Like any narcotic, thatpropaganda worked only so long and then began breaking down. As for the moralitytales about big-city degenerates getting hooked on heroin, those were simplyirrelevant. In fact, I had no interest in “drugs” in junior high, but that hadbegun to change. Timothy Leary was active on the national stage, and that springI read The Doors of Perception. Continuing its campaign either to corrupt oreducate America’s youth, Life had published its famous LSD cover story on March25, 1966, entitled “The Exploding Threat of the Mind Drug that Got Out ofControl.” You had to hand it to Life, even if its editors were motivated bynothing but the most craven sensationalism. While their LSD feature was morealarmist than their landmark article on magic mushrooms in 1957, it probably ledmillions of otherwise wholesome young Americans down the primrose path topsychedelic perdition. It certainly got my attention.By that summer I was quite aware of cannabis and psychedelics. Thanks to Terenceand my own inherent curiosity, I was interested in giving pot and LSD a try, ifeither could have been had in Paonia. Like most small-town kids, my first realdrug trip would be courtesy of that dreary nerve poison, alcohol. I was hangingout with those new friends who were all a year ahead of me in school. We didn’tdo much on the weekends except “cruise” Grand Avenue, all three blocks of it,just slowly driving from one end of it to the other, hoping to attract theattention of girls (not that there were any we could see). We varied the routineby taking off for the city park, often in the company of a guitar or two. Wewere part of a procession of similarly bored teenagers, in our town and townsacross the country, without much else to do.Despite being underage, we occasionally scored some 3.2 beer, the only kind soldin town. The watery stuff made me a little woozy but had little effect beyondthat. So when my friend Tom got his hands on two pints of blackberry brandy justin time for the Fourth of July dance at the high school, we knew we were in fora good time. Tom was older and more sophisticated than I was; I looked up tohim. He was good-looking, played a mean guitar, owned a really cool 1948Plymouth coupe, and knew how to charm girls, or at least I thought he did; hecertainly gave the impression of being wise in the ways of love. As we drove tothe dance in Tom’s black coupe, our blackberry brandy in the glove compartment,I was up for anything, but the night didn’t go as planned.I drank three-quarters of one bottle within the first hour, sitting in Tom’scar. I was feeling pretty good, brave and dashing, and had completely lost myusual shyness as I headed for the gym, hoping to pick up a girl, or at leasttalk to one. I don’t remember exactly what transpired, or what I said or did,but later I learned I’d been pretty obnoxious; in fact, I had acted like acomplete jerk. After thoroughly insulting several girls, I was asked to leave.And I did, or rather, Tom steered me to the car, where we drank more, and thenhe drove me home despite my vehement objections. I sat in my bedroom for awhile, furious at him for spoiling my fun, and then decided to return to thedance and set out reeling down the street. I arrived to find Tom was nowhere tobe seen. My condition soon attracted the notice of the local cop, who took mehome in the patrol car. Somewhat sobered and intimidated, I made it to my roomand fell into a fitful sleep. The next day the cop dropped by and talked to myfather, who wasn’t too upset; he’d probably done similar things as a teenager.Such was the coming of age for many a small-town boy back in the day. I took my first puff of cannabis about five days after that misadventure.Terence had come home for a few weeks after his first year at Berkeley, alongwith his new cute girlfriend, who I’ll call Elaine. Terence was smitten withher, and it was easy to see why. Elaine was a pretty girl, from upstate NewYork, if I recall. The fact that she was Jewish may have added to her attractionfor Terence; he might have hoped our Catholic parents would be shocked at thisliaison, but if so they didn’t let on. Anyway, the two arrived with a lid ofwhat was probably terrible weed and a couple of capsules of acid. Terencesolemnly informed me that each contained “a thousand mikes”—1,000 micrograms, anenormous dose. If so, the LSD must have been very pure, because the two largegelatin caps appeared to be empty. I just got to look at them once, and I don’tknow if they took them on their visit.The cannabis was a different story. Terence kept it in a little bottle in asilken Chinese pouch, together with a tiny pipe. One lazy afternoon they invitedme to stroll across the street to the park, where we spread out one of Mom’spatchwork quilts beneath a big tree, unpacked some soft drinks and sandwiches,and proceeded to toke up, right there in plain sight. Terence and Elaine didn’tseem too concerned, when I wondered aloud about smoking the “stuff” in public.In fact there were few people in the park that day, and nobody was payingattention. Terence said no one would know what we were doing anyway, and he wasapparently right. We shared a pipe or two; nothing happened. I didn’t feel athing, though the “grass” tasted good going down. But I really didn’t know whatI was supposed to feel, and the result was disappointing.It took perhaps three more sessions there under the trees before I finally gotit. When I finally did learn what it was to be stoned—and I think it is alearned state—suddenly everything seemed hilarious. When I closed my eyes andlay back in the sunshine, a flurry of geometric patterns flooded my closed lids;when I opened them and examined the blanket, the texture of the weave wasrevealed in almost microscopic detail, and I could have scrutinized it forhours. The abstract patterns on one of the stitched-together swatches appearedlike writing in an alien language. Thought became fluid, spontaneous. Peculiarideas, those patterns behind the eyes, sensual and emotional impressions flowedtogether in a cascading rush of images, memories, puns, snatches of rememberedsongs, faces of friends—and all of it happening in a circus-like atmosphere ofjoyousness and hilarity. I thought I must be making a spectacle of myself andactually came to my senses for a moment. But nothing was happening; we weresimply three people sitting quietly on a blanket in the park.This was great! The cannabis high was so much better than the alcohol-fueleddebacle of a few days before. I couldn’t believe how crude alcohol intoxicationwas in comparison. I could handle this. And it was so much more interesting.There was actual content to this experience, interesting ideas and thoughtfragments, and these in turn sparked scintillating conversation. I immediatelyunderstood: this was my drug.Following my initiation, Terence returned to Berkeley for his second year in theTussman program. I don’t remember much about that fall except that I missed mybrother and the glamorous life he was living out on the coast. I chafed at theidea of being imprisoned in town. What’s more, I had no dope, no cannabis tosalve my angst, and no one to really talk to except Madeline, Richard, and thenew friends I’d grown closer to over the summer. I welcomed their company, but Icouldn’t share ideas with them in the way I could with Terence.What my friends and I did share was the goal of scoring some weed, which rumorhad we could find in Aspen if we asked the right people. Aspen was alreadynotorious as a place for beatniks and weirdos, a bohemian enclave and aplayground of the decadent rich. The only person I knew in Aspen who might beable to help was a guy from Paonia who had moved to Aspen to work inconstruction. We took a trip there one weekend in Tom’s coupe and found himliving in a boardinghouse along with a number of other dirty, longhairedpeople—actual hippies! I was delighted to encounter such kindred spirits justdown the road. The feeling was not mutual. They didn’t want to be bothered bysome snotnosed kids from home, let alone supply them with drugs. We returnedempty-handed and had only weak beer to console us.Over the summer, drugs had emerged as a bone of contention between Terence andour parents, especially our father. Along with the radical political views, thehirsute appearance, the strange clothing—in other words, the appurtenances ofthe hippie persona that Terence was adopting—drug use was beyond the pale. Alldrugs were “garbage” in our father’s view, the worst possible thing one could beinto; there was simply no way the topic could be rationally discussed.We both found this attitude rather puzzling; after all, Mom and Dad were notprudes. They enjoyed drinking and had lived rather wildly as young adults inCalifornia before and during the war. But in our father’s mind, alcohol was nota drug; its effects were on the muscles, in his thinking, and not the brain. Heviewed drinking as essentially benign, a thing one did recreationally to relaxin social situations. All drugs, on the other hand, he equated to heroin—allwere addictive, destructive, and evil. Part of his attitude toward drugsresulted from an experience he had during the war (so he said). On a bombingmission over Germany, one of his crewmates had been badly injured by flakshrapnel, but when his buddies broke open the medical kit to give him a shot forhis terrible pain, they found that, as Dad said, “Some hophead had stolen themorphine.”After an incident like that, one could see why he didn’t have much sympathy fordrug addicts, but that was irrelevant; we weren’t talking about addictive drugs.To him it didn’t matter. There was no difference between cannabis, LSD, orheroin; all were intrinsically bad. Like many others, he made the mistake ofseeing evil as a moral quality imbued in the substances, not a product of howthey were used. All of this, of course, was more grist for the ongoingcontentious conversations between Terence and our father. Terence was inrebellion against everything our parents’ generation stood for, and drugs were ahot-button issue, another excuse for screaming matches.Terence didn’t come home for Christmas in 1966. He remained in Berkeley, wheremy mother and I visited him around the new year. He was living in a kind ofscholar’s retreat, a tiny loft in a broken-down Victorian house on Tunnel Road.It was a great place, a kind of aerie surrounded by a walled garden, far fromthe chaotic scene closer to the university. By then Terence was well into theTussman program and had accumulated the core of his first library, the onedestroyed by fire in 1970. He was reading extensively in many esoteric subjects,including alchemy, Eastern philosophy, and black magic, as well as Jung, Eliade,shamanism, drug literature, and—a new discovery—Marshall McLuhan. McLuhan wasgetting a lot of press at the time, not all of it conducive to being regarded asa serious thinker. As Terence later put it, McLuhan wanted to cultivate a newsophistication about the media, only to see the media parody him to death.Terence and I delved more deeply into McLuhan’s work than most did; I believe hehad some rather amazing insights that have stood the test of time. Terence’seclectic reading was totally in keeping with Tussman’s insistence that hisstudents explore whatever piqued their interest. This came quite naturally toTerence.For some reason—inexplicably, given the edgy relations between Terence and ourfather—I was permitted to go to California and stay with my brother right afterChristmas. Mom joined us about a week later. Elaine had gone home for theholidays, so Terence stayed at her apartment while my mother and I shared his.But for a glorious week before that, I stayed with Terence, bedding down on amattress on the floor. I didn’t mind that at all. We were by then fullco-conspirators, and I relished any chance to hang with him and soak up the richideas we exchanged as the long hours of gloomy twilight dissolved into theevenings and the shadows settled into the corners of our little refuge.Terence had by this time discovered something else that made those eveningstogether especially pleasurable: hashish! It was my first introduction tohashish, and it was much stronger and far more interesting than the weakcannabis he had brought out the previous summer. We smoked it in a metal waterpipe with a tiny bowl and a curved stem, the kind that you could buy inChinatown (and still can). We passed many an hour in stoned conversations abouteverything under the sun, passing the pipe and savoring each other’s company. Wehad always been kindred spirits, it seemed, but until then we hadn’t reallyunderstood that. I cherish the memories of those hours to this day, though timehas left only fragments, not a full recollection.I do remember one important event, however, and that was when Terence persuadedMom to try smoking hashish. She had been more open-minded about the drug issuethan our father, though she had kept very quiet during the arguments of theprevious summer. But the topic was in the air, especially there in the Bay Areawith the hippie scene in full flower. A couple of years earlier, I’d overheardmy mother and two of her friends talking about LSD: It was a drug, she had read,that could teach you about yourself; you might learn you were capable of murder,or that you had unsuspected knowledge and insights. That comment struck me asodd at the time, but it spoke to the fact that my mother was at least a bit opento the idea that these substances were not entirely bad.So I was surprised, but not too surprised, when Terence gave her the pitch. Hemade the point that cannabis was really not so bad and indeed there were thingsyou could learn from it. She agreed to try it, and he loaded the pipe and weshared it with her. The results weren’t definitive. Mom was so wracked withguilt, and so afraid of how furious Dad would be if he ever found out she’dactually gotten stoned with her sons, she couldn’t really let herself go andenjoy the experience. She didn’t say much about it afterwards except that shehad noticed an intensification of colors. And that was about it. It’s a pity,really. Had we all been able to sit down and get stoned together, it could havedone much to heal the strains in our family. But it was not fated to happen, andas a result the tensions over the issue continued for years to come. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 15 - The Tutor I returned from Berkeley determined to secure some cannabis and to continue withmy own quiet revolution, in solidarity with my brother. Fired up by ourdiscussions, I became the Tussman program’s extension school of one, readingJung, McLuhan, and Eliade, and biding my time. I also got to know one of the newteachers, who was all of twenty-four, cute in a plain way, and fresh out ofcollege. Fay, as I’ll call her, had a head on her shoulders and was starved forconversation and company—especially male company. A divorced, single mother witha child of four or five, she wasn’t exactly welcomed by the Lady’s Auxiliary.The town was narrow-minded in the way only small towns can be, and Fay was anoutsider and not allowed to forget it. That made her easy prey for anextra-environmental like me, a young man who felt like an outsider even thoughhe’d been living there all his life.Actually, it soon became unclear who was preying on whom. Fay and I startedhanging out; I’d stop by her house and we’d have long conversations. Nothinguntoward happened on those visits, but I think we both wanted it to. We diddiscuss cannabis, which Fay, though hardly a hippie chick, had smoked a coupletimes, and liked, in college. So we hatched a small conspiracy, which involvedconvincing Terence to mail Fay a lid of weed. Brilliant! The plan worked. Ournewly arrived supply of precious weed was probably quite inferior bycontemporary standards, but we had it.We didn’t just smoke up; this called for a special occasion. As luck would haveit, my father was set to attend his company’s annual sales meeting in Denver, athree-or four-day affair that my mother, joining him, turned into a shortholiday in the big city. They ended up leaving me on my own for nearly one wholeglorious week. I was sixteen, after all; and besides, by then Terence and I hadterrorized every babysitter in the valley, making it unlikely anyone would havesigned up to mind me.So a window of opportunity quickly opened for Fay and me to have our specialevening. Most readers must know by now where this is headed. I was, of course, avirgin, a status I was determined to change. Fay seemed quite willing tocooperate, though we didn’t speak of the matter until that night. I had pickedher up in my parent’s Chevy and brought her back to the house, not wantinganyone to see her car parked outside. I had already prepped the house, closingall the curtains and turning off most of the lights. We toked up and drank alittle; we got very stoned and hilarious. The next thing we knew we were gropingeach other, and a minute later we were on the little bed in my room. I wasnervous and didn’t know what I was doing. Fay could see this and was kind, andeventually we completed a fairly inept coupling. It’s said that is something younever forget, and I guess that’s true. We hung out for a while and finished upthe pipe, she gathered up her things, and I took her home. I made a quick detourto the bridge to smash the wine bottle on the rocks below and crept back home inthe quiet night. No security breach, no drama.We never repeated that experience. I think we were both a little appalled at ourrecklessness. I continued to visit her once in a while, but we began to worrythat people would talk, and our conversations became less frequent. At the endof the semester she moved on. Recently, others have informed me that I was nother only conquest. If those other accounts are true, Fay may have arrived withan agenda to sample the pleasures of the local randy but virginal males; therewas nothing particularly special about me. So much for my self-flattering beliefthat Fay liked me for my intellect! I wish her well, wherever she is. She mayhave had bad judgment, but she was a good spirit, and I shall always be gratefulto her for introducing me to the pleasures of sex, awkward and halting thoughthe occasion was. It’s gotten both harder and easier, somehow, as life hasprogressed. One good thing was, I now had a new supply of cannabis, lovely cannabis! Istarted smoking it on a regular basis, getting completely baked on ridiculouslysmall amounts. Looking back, I think much of my reaction could be traced to theplacebo effect, but placebo or not, it was wonderful. Being stoned was the onlytime I felt normal. I loved nothing more than to sit in my room, have a toke ortwo, and “ruminate.” The experiences were similar to those first times on theblanket in the park—strange, fragmentary thought processes leading intointeresting, often hilarious byways. The cannabis high is like a state ofenhanced bemusement. Every thought is interesting; and everything before theopen eyes or behind the closed eyelids is endlessly fascinating. There areaudial hallucinations, evocations of deep aural spaces, often accompanied bycomplex hypnagogic tapestries. Music becomes a transformative experience. Inoticed in those early days there was a distinct figure/ground phenomenon, wherethings in the background became the object of attention, while the foregroundwas not perceived or was relegated to background. I noticed this particularlywhen reading while stoned. The words would not only resonate in my head, but thespaces between and around the letters became somehow more important than theletters. This happened to the point where it began to interfere with reading.Then, gradually, the problem would fix itself and I could again read smoothly.I’m not sure what was going on, but I think that when one first starts smoking,there’s a period of entrainment or adaptation to the state. Once one isentrained, being stoned becomes a lot like being “normal.” It feels like anormal state of mind; one is comfortable there, but something is lost on theintensity scale. The early experiences were practically psychedelic in theirintensity, whereas later I didn’t get close to that when I smoked.But it took a while to reach that point. For now, I had cannabis, and I wasextremely sensitive to it. I loved how I could be completely toasted and yethave a perfectly normal conversation with my parents. They hadn’t a clue. Atfirst, I guarded my tiny stash jealously. I didn’t want to run out, and Terencehad sternly admonished me—“You must speak of this to no one!”—in the same tonehe used to say, “Never oppose my will!” I got that. After all our talks aboutblack magic and alchemy (Terence had confided that he’d actually taped shutcertain grimoires of black magic he had, not trusting himself to open thosebooks) I was down with the idea of secrecy. Cannabis and certain other drugswere really black arts, or at least forbidden knowledge. But the secrecy didn’tlast. I wanted to share the discovery with my close friends, and as spring fadedinto summer I started turning them on, starting with Richard, then proceedingthrough the rest of our stoner band. By the end of June all six of us wereregularly crowding into my bedroom and getting loaded.I smoked whenever I could. I enjoyed smoking with my friends, but some of mybest experiences were when I smoked alone, rambling around the sagebrush-coveredhills outside of town. And now, I had access to a car! I could go out to the’dobes or the gravel pit or sometimes Bethlehem Cemetery and toke up. I’d gettotally, utterly wasted on these solitary wanderings. I’d spend that timeruminating, looking at things, like bugs, plants, trees, rocks,whatever—ruminating, and creating a narrative.Bethlehem Cemetery was especially inviting, a small, pretty spot nestled in alittle bowl on the drive up to Pitkin Mesa. There was never anyone there, and itwas peaceful and shady on a summer’s afternoon. I’d get totally loaded andwander around looking at the headstones, speculating about the lives of thenames there. Once I found a gravestone bearing the names of a husband and wife,the husband having died a year to the day after her. It was clear to me that hehad died of a broken heart. This little vignette, like the others I imagined,seemed enormously romantic and poignant to me. I suppose it was a passionatetime of life. I felt things strongly, and the cannabis only made them moreintense. On a recent visit to Paonia, I drove up to the cemetery around dusk ona beautiful fall evening. It was just as peaceful and lovely as I remembered it,as though the world had passed it by for the last four-and-a-half decades. Itwas a timeless little glade, a sanctuary in the midst of an impermanent world,and most reassuring. I did not smoke this time; I had no cannabis with me. Itwas not necessary. As I wandered along the paths gazing at the old headstones,the memories and the contact high were more than enough.Once loaded in one of my various countryside haunts, there was the small matterof driving back into town. The main challenge for me was the time-dilationeffect. Everything. Was. Really. Slowed. Down. But at least I wasn’t tempted tobreak any speed limits on the way home. In fact I would creep into town at aboutten miles an hour. Nobody ever stopped me or even seemed to notice, probablybecause in town nobody drove much faster than that anyway.I wrote less over those months. I had kept a journal the previous summer andwritten quite a lot. I had discovered Taoism at the time and was fascinated byit, by the idea of living in harmony with nature, so gracefully that one’simprint on the earth was as light as a feather. Taoism seemed to me at the timeto be one of the few religions that made sense. It is actually more a philosophythan a religion, and that was appealing. No faith or dogma, just learning tolive in harmony—what’s not to like about that? Much of my journal-writing overthe previous summer had been devoted to exploring the character and actions ofthe ideal man, in Taoist terms, which I aspired to become. I tried to start thatup again, but my efforts were half-hearted. Ironically, not writing about theman in Tao was probably a more Taoist thing to do than to write about it. Youdon’t write about the Tao; you live it, or try to live it. But when I wasstoned, thoughts came too quickly; they were too interesting, they could not bepinned to the page! Yeah, yeah, I know: Pot makes you lazy. There is somethingto that. So my literary productivity over the summer suffered. But that was OK.I was too immersed in the richness of rumination to worry about writing it down. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 16 - A Psychedelic Education Now that I’ve conveyed a picture of my teenage self lost in thought, I want totake a wider look at what Terence and I were actually thinking about. As must beclear by now, we lived largely in our heads. Ideas and concepts were what mostexcited us, and being bookish was a point of pride. We fancied ourselvesscholars with more depth than our friends, let alone the “meatheads” we had tosuffer on a daily basis. Though we were certainly immersed in the memes thenpermeating mass culture, our serious interests also colored our worldview.Indeed, both scholarly and popular ideas figured in our efforts to understandour early psychedelic experiences. Together they formed the conceptual toolkit,however inadequate or incomplete, we later took with us on our South Americanquest. As such, our influences played a crucial role in what happened to us atLa Chorrera.Our psychedelic education began with cosmology and astronomy, both of which weremore my pursuits than Terence’s. I mentioned my early dream of studyingastrophysics under George Gamow, an originator of the Big Bang theory. I playedat observational astronomy without being very good at it; what really excited mewas reading about cosmology. I devoured books by Gamow and his scientific rival,the English astronomer Fred Hoyle, along with anything else in the field I couldget my hands on. I loved how those ideas freed my imagination. Cosmology dealswith the really big questions: How did the universe originate? How did the solarsystem and the planets form? What will happen to the universe in the distantfuture? For a twelve-or thirteen-year-old just beginning to realize the tenetsof his faith were wearing a little thin, the thought there might be scientificanswers to questions about humanity’s ultimate fate had great appeal. What faithI had I put in science, no longer wasting it on God or the church.Every culture has its own creation myth, its own cosmology. And in some respectsevery cosmology is true, even if I might flatter myself in assuming mine issomehow truer because it is scientific. But it seems to me that no culture,including scientific culture, has cornered the market on definitive answers whenit comes to the ultimate questions. Science may couch its models in the languageof mathematics and observational astronomy, while other cultures use poetry andsacrificial propitiations to defend theirs. But in the end, no one knows, atleast not yet. The current flux in the state of scientific cosmology attests tothis, as we watch physicists and astronomers argue over string theory andmultiverses and the cosmic inflation hypothesis.Many of the postulates of modern cosmology lie beyond, or at least at the outerfringes, of what can be verified through observation. As a result, aesthetics—asreflected by the “elegance” of the mathematical models—has become as importantas observation in assessing the validity of a cosmological theory. There is theassumption, sometimes explicit and sometimes not, that the universe isrationally constructed, that it has an inherent quality of beauty, and that anymathematical model that does not exemplify an underlying, unifying simplicity isto be considered dubious if not invalid on such criteria alone.This is really nothing more than an article of faith; and it is one of the fewinstances where science is faith-based, at least in its insistence that theuniverse can be understood, that it “makes sense.” It is not entirely afaith-based position, in that we can invoke the history of science to supportthe proposition that, so far, science has been able to make sense, in a limitedway, of much of what it has scrutinized. (The psychedelic experience may proveto be an exception.) Based on past experience, one may hope that science willeventually produce a valid cosmological model that encompasses all we currentlyknow—at least until new knowledge requires that the model be discarded orradically revised.In the meantime, we are free to speculate, and to watch the cosmologists battleit out via their conferences and writings. Terence and I found our vicariousparticipation in that process to be great fun. Thinking about cosmology forcesone to stretch his or her imagination around some pretty wild ideas. Paralleluniverses, other dimensions, space-time dilation, black holes, and time travelare alien concepts to most people, but they are bread and butter for amateurcosmologists, among others. In pondering such ideas, one is led, inevitably, togaze up at the stars and wonder what other entities are gazing back, perhapspondering the same things. Another major early influence was science fiction, and for that I credit myfather. Along with the “men’s magazines” we weren’t supposed to see but did, heoccasionally brought home issues of Fate, with its focus on the paranormal, andsci-fi pulp mags like Analog or Fantasy and Science Fiction. His reading wasanother way he wasn’t “average” despite insisting that he was—and, more irksome,insisting we should be as well. I doubt his peers were reading this stuff, butTerence and I were all over it. I still enjoy science fiction, and much of whatis written today is far superior to what we read as kids. Science fiction isgood for the mind. It keeps one open to possibilities and, more than any otherfictional genre, helps one to anticipate and prepare for the future. In fact,science fiction creates the future, by articulating a vision of what we as aculture imagine for ourselves. The world we live in today is, in part, a sci-fivision of the future from the 1950s made real. We now have, and take forgranted, pocket phones, global telecommunications, personal computers, geneticengineering, bioterrorism, and environmental collapse; sci-fi writersanticipated them all. They also foresaw much that hasn’t been realized, andfailed to foresee much that has. The lesson, if any, is that reality will alwaysbe stranger, richer, and more complex than fiction.In the early sixties, the sci-fi authors we loved were the old-school giants:Isaac Asimov, Theodore Sturgeon, Robert Heinlein, Ray Bradbury, James Blish, andespecially Arthur C. Clarke. Jules Verne was an early favorite, as was H.G.Wells, whose novel The Time Machine had a big impact on me in my preteen years.The notion of time travel fascinated me then (and does now) and fed apreoccupation with the future and the nature of time that Terence and I shared.But it was Clarke who had the greatest impact on our thinking, thanks largely tohis novels Childhood’s End (1953) and The City and the Stars (1956). Those twoearly books strike me as more inspired than much of his later work, even 2001: ASpace Odyssey (1968), although that comes close.The City and the Stars begins in Diaspar, a super-technological city a billionyears in Earth’s future whose inhabitants maintain their longevity through whatClarke termed the Eternity Circuits, an early anticipation of nanotechnology.Only a fraction of the populace is incarnate at a given time; the rest arestored as solid-state templates in the Central Computer. (Clarke’s notion ofuploaded consciousness is yet another of his glimpses of the eventuallypossible, though in this case not one in the foreseeable future). The noveltakes the form of a hero’s journey, a classic shamanic tale. Its main figure,Alvin, is a “Unique” who, unlike his fellow inhabitants, has an irresistiblecompulsion to leave Diaspar, though no one has ventured out for more than ahundred million years. The City and the Stars is actually a revision of Clarke’sfirst novel, Against the Fall of Night (1948). The result is an incrediblework—ahead of its time then, and ahead of ours now.Childhood’s End, a “first contact” story, is another classic. It begins in whatfor Clarke was still the near future. Just as the Soviets and Americans near thefurious end of their race to launch the first space probe, mile-wide starshipsappear, poised over every major city in the world. And there they remain, orseem to, asserting their presence but otherwise hardly communicating. Decadespass; eventually the population becomes so accustomed to the vessels they areall but ignored. It is then that the visitors send an emissary to the surface, afigure whose shocking appearance activates a number of archetypes long buried inthe human psyche. Several movies have addressed the first-contact theme,including Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and Independence Day (1996).All of them, even a classic like the 1951 version of The Day the Earth StoodStill, are rather lame compared to Childhood’s End, and it puzzles me that noone has brought the book to the screen. Its themes are even timelier today thanwhen it was published many decades ago.Terence and I were also drawn to H. P. Lovecraft, an early twentieth-centurywriter who captivated many of our peers. Lovecraft’s work is not exactly sciencefiction, but rather belongs, in my view, to a sub-genre, science-fiction horror.His work is suffused with various horrors originating beyond the stars, from thedepths of the oceans, or in the remote past. These things are non-human, alien,eldritch—Lovecraft’s favored word for the uncanny or strange—that may lieundisturbed for millennia, known only to a few cognoscenti. Inevitably, thesehorrors erupt into the comfortable, familiar world, usually due to somecharacter’s foolish curiosity and inability to resist meddling in matters bestleft to rest. For us, these themes were far more compelling than those of EdgarAllan Poe, for example. Poe and others tended to write about “ghosties andghoulies,” a more pedestrian brand of horror with origins in the repressed darkside of the Judeo-Christian mindset. Lovecraft went beyond that, hinting athorrors far more ancient than civilization, humanity, or even earth itself. Arecurring theme is that scientific curiosity, our pursuit of forbiddenknowledge, and our reckless flirtation with malevolent cosmic forces carry thepotential to undermine the very foundations of reality.For whatever reason, we loved these ideas, or at least we loved scaringourselves with the notion that just beyond the veil of the mundane world weremultiple realities that could manifest themselves at any time. Lovecraft madehis tales all the more effective by not over-describing his malevolent entities,leaving the details to the reader’s imagination. I suspect the movie Alien(1979) was influenced by Lovecraft; the creature is certainly an unspeakablehorror from “somewhere else” in the universe (we never do learn where), and“alien” to everything human; but one never gets a complete view of it until theclimactic moment when Ripley blasts him (her? it?) out the airlock. Until then,one sees fleeting glimpses that evoke our nightmares of things insectile,spidery, reptilian, octopoid, crab-like, slimy, shiny, machine-like,shark-like—but never a full picture. The viewer must fill in the details, to farmore terrifying effect.Another writer we admired was Philip K. Dick, although we didn’t read him untilthe late sixties. If Lovecraft was the master of trans-dimensional horror, Dickmight be called the master of the “paranoid” genre of science fiction. Hisfiction often centers on themes of alternate realities, or on characters thatdiscover they are victims of massive political conspiracies, or that theirreality is an illusion or a drug-induced hallucination. More than any othersci-fi author at the time, Dick, who died in 1982 at age fifty-three, exploredplot devices related to psychoactive drugs and altered states. Amphetamine washis drug of choice, and much of his early fiction was apparently written underits influence. Dick published The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch—there’s theLovecraftian influence again—in 1965. Though Rolling Stone declared it the“classic LSD novel of all time,” according to Wikipedia, Dick evidently wrote itbefore any personal encounters with the drug. Set in the twenty-first century ata time when the solar system has been widely colonized, people use anhallucinogen called CAN-D to enter a dreamlike state that allows them to projecttheir shared experiences onto actual props, or “layouts,” rendering theirfantasies all the more real.Dick’s novels are permeated with themes related to the nature of reality, thefragility of personal identity, drug use, and mental illness. In fact, some ofDick’s later novels—especially VALIS, The Divine Invasion, and theTransmigration of Timothy Archer—are centered on characters confronted withcontinuum-disrupting events that teeter on the thin edge between psychoticbreakdown and mystical revelation. These tales bear uncanny similarities to ourown experiences at La Chorrera to the extent that they seemed like a validationwhen they came to our attention in the mid-seventies. Dick was heavilyinfluenced by the ideas of Carl Jung, as were we. Much of Dick’s work has beentranslated into movies, with varying degrees of success. Blade Runner (1982),arguably one of the best science-fiction films of all time, was based on hisshort story “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” Others include Total Recall(1990), Minority Report (2002), A Scanner Darkly (2006), and The AdjustmentBureau (2011). I suspect that many of the filmmakers who are inspired by hiswork grew up, as we did, in the same milieu as Dick. In fact, certain sharedinfluences—Clarke, Dick, Lovecraft, and others—have become such pervasiveelements of contemporary culture because they are echoes of our generation’sadolescent experiences, including psychedelic experiences.If science-fiction books influenced our worldview, so did mass-market movies andtelevision. While there may have been something unique in how we interpreted allthat, our exposure was not unique. Millions shared the experience of watchingThe Twilight Zone, for example, or any number of popular films.One movie that influenced me was Charly (1968), adapted from the 1966 novelFlowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes. As many know, it’s the story of a mentallydisabled man who undergoes an experimental treatment that dramatically increaseshis IQ. The movie chronicles the mental, emotional, and social problems heendures as his relationships with family and friends change, only to see his newcapabilities slowly fade. This idea of being radically transformed into asuperhuman had great appeal for me, probably because I was shy and identifiedwith someone who suddenly found himself attractive to a woman he had secretlyloved. The film must have struck some deep chord in my subconscious, because itsthemes emerged years later during our experiment at La Chorrera, as did aspectsof Planet of the Apes (1968) and the novels I mentioned by Arthur C. Clarke.Though I’d read those books years earlier, their tropes were still in thearchives of my memory, ready to be activated by the right trigger.Of all of the movies that figured in the zeitgeist back then, none had a moreprofound impact than Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Kubrick andClarke had written the screenplay while the latter was writing his novel of thesame name. Their collaboration is still quite possibly the greatest sci-fi filmever made. The film is about humanity’s ultimate encounter with a superior yetbenevolent alien intelligence that has long been guiding the species’ destiny.With its themes of evolutionary transformation, alien contact, and a greaterfate awaiting us among the stars, 2001 defined the aspirations of ourgeneration. Though it didn’t directly deal with psychedelics, the “light show”at the climax, as David Bowman’s module is sucked into the hyperspatial portal,is close enough to the DMT “light show” that many of us assumed the filmsequence had been modeled after it. Dimethyltryptamine, a powerful psychedelic,was rare and hard to get at the time, and thus all the more mysterious andfascinating. Like Bowman’s hyperspatial plunge into the monolith/portal, DMTbrings with it a sense of rapid acceleration, of diving headlong into anoverwhelmingly bizarre abyss, freighted with portentousness and hints ofinsect-like metamorphosis.Kubrick’s 2001 was literally about pushing the envelope, including the biggest,the one that limits human experience to the here and now. The film spokestrongly to our generation, because we were involved in pushing all kinds ofenvelopes, testing the limits of conventional morality, politics, academics,and, ultimately, conscious experience. And psychedelics provided the tools. Manyof us thought then, and still do, that the consumption of psychedelics, eitheraccidental or deliberate, may have spurred on cognitive evolution, the explosiveincrease in the size and complexity of the hominid brain between two million and100,000 years ago. This idea fit the intuition of many psychedelic enthusiaststhat these substances were not only transformative for the individual, but forthe species as a whole.No wonder we were so ready to interpret 2001 as a hopeful manifesto for ourtranscendent future. Now more than a decade past the actual 2001, we rememberthat year not as we had hoped to—as the moment when humanity joined the galacticcommunity—but for the tragic events of 9/11. That trauma has left deep scars onthe nation, if not much of the world, and has apparently precipitated a longdescent into a very dark age, indeed. Among the things that Terence turned me onto, along with lot of edgy ideas andcontrolled substances, were folk music and rock and roll. I mentioned that in mypreteen years I was a musical snob and dreamt of being a classical guitarist ora conductor. My indifference to pop music began to change when Terence came homefor Christmas after his first semester at Berkeley with the latest album by theBeatles, Rubber Soul. The following summer he arrived with Bob Dylan’s BringingIt All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited, both also from 1965. With his crypticlyrics, gravelly voice, and message of impending change, Dylan especially seemedto speak to the yearnings of our generation. I was soon drawn to others likePeter, Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, and Woody Guthrie. On the rock side, inaddition to the Beatles, were the Rolling Stones, the Grateful Dead, and someother psychedelic bands. As all good music should, theirs expressed the mood ofthe times. My parents didn’t get that, as suggested by my father’s nickname forDylan: “Gravel Gertie.” He’d grown up listening to Frank Sinatra’s silken voiceand couldn’t appreciate how Dylan’s could be considered music. As a result henever actually listened to Dylan’s message, which I suspect he didn’t want tohear. We appreciated Dylan partly because we understood something about his tiesto black music, especially the blues, where a gruff voice was a mark ofauthenticity. But that my parents didn’t embrace such music made it better. Wedidn’t want to identify with anything that was theirs, and we knew this musicwas ours.By then I’d begun giving up on my musical ambitions. Besides pop and classical,I loved jazz, and in high school I half-heartedly played the double bass. Ifantasized about being one of those cool improvisational jazz guys who playedwith the likes of Dave Brubeck and John Coltrane, but I had no talentwhatsoever. The band director, Mr. Den Beste, was a bit of a stuffed shirt butalso a gifted educator. When even he couldn’t make a good musician out of me,perhaps I realized my efforts to master the instrument would be in vain. He onceused my bass to illustrate the principle of sympathetic resonance. If one plucksan A note, for example, another string tuned to A will also begin to vibrate.And if one then damps off the original string, the sympathetic string continuesto resonate. His vivid illustration was an interesting bit of physics trivia atthe time, but later became very important at La Chorrera, which is why I mentionit here.While I didn’t have much musical talent, I knew others who did. A few of myclose friends were pretty good guitar players, thanks in part to growing up withmusic-loving fathers and brothers. As I noted, their guitars became a big partof our hanging out. Renditions of Dylan were a favorite; nothing could beathearing my friend Gary angrily rap out “Masters of War” or “A Hard Rain’sA-Gonna Fall” in his own rough voice. Those songs reflected our anxieties andour determination never to give in, to fight what we saw as the corruptness ofour parent’s generation, whose legacy to the world was the specter of nuclearannihilation.Popular music, rock music, became a passion, even an obsession, for many peoplemy age. My wife, for example, is practically a music scholar. She knows theartists, often the specific albums, of almost all popular music from themid-fifties on. Though I’ve always enjoyed music, it was not destined to playsuch an important role in my life. I don’t have music constantly playing in thebackground, because that affects my concentration. Come to think of it, Terencewas not very musically inclined either. He enjoyed listening to music, ofcourse, but he never played in a band or took up any instrument. While sittingaround, he rarely took the initiative to put on an album, though if someone elsedid, he was usually happy to listen. I think maybe we were too verbal, toolanguage-oriented, to appreciate music thoroughly. Music can distract from theinner conversation one is always having, and maybe that interfered with ourinner dialogue. Music, too, is distinctly a function of the right brain, and wewere both left-brain dominant.Nevertheless, pop music, like pop culture in general, profoundly influenced us,as it did so many others. Though Terence and I were never to be “average” in ourfather’s idealized sense of the word, we were both versions of Everyman, on apersonal journey to adulthood through a rapidly changing cultural landscape. Ourexperiences resonate with those of so many of our contemporaries because theytook the same pilgrimage, albeit starting out from different places. Many of ourcontemporaries have become important figures in the arts, politics, science, andacademics, putting them in a position to shape the zeitgeist. Is it any wonderthat it sometimes seems as if we’re living in a mass hallucination? In fact weare, and it’s one we have constructed. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 17 - Mapping Inner Space: Carl Jung The works of C. G. Jung played a crucial role in our developing thought—orescalating delusion, as some might have uncharitably described it. Terenceencountered Jung shortly after moving to California and soon shared theexperience with me. Before the 1960s, Jung’s ideas were considered radical; thereigning paradigm of human consciousness could be traced to Freud, Jung’s mentorand eventual rival. By the mid-sixties, however, Jung’s ideas were gainingcredibility. About the time we were exploring Jung, so were many psychologists,as the deficiencies of the Freudian model of mind were becoming more apparent.Though it’s long been held that Jung never used psychedelics, he was aware ofthem, or at least aware of the American physician Weir Mitchell’s experimentswith mescaline. Jung’s Liber Novus, a work long suppressed by his heirs,suggests that Jung may have been more directly involved with psychedelics thanpreviously thought. Published in 2009, the Red Book, as it is known, was ajournal that Jung began in 1914 shortly after breaking with Freud and thenworked on for more than a decade. The iconography of the Red Book, which Jungwrote and illustrated by hand, is certainly psychedelic, though overt allusionsto plants or mushrooms are absent. For Jung as well as Freud, dreams were theportals to the unconscious. It’s reasonable to suppose that had Jung’s careerpeaked a few decades later, he would have probably used LSD or some othersubstance as an exploratory tool. Indeed, he may have done so in secret, fearinghe’d be discredited for venturing beyond accepted practice if word of that gotout.But whether Jung used psychedelics or relied on his own remarkable talent fordeep introspection, he was undeniably a pioneer in exploring the unconsciousrealm. Many of the areas that he investigated early in his career—alchemy, the IChing, archetypes, synchronicity, and personality integration—found newresonance in the 1960s, not only among psychologists, but also among those whotoday we call “psychonauts.” For them, Jung’s worked provided a framework forunderstanding psychedelic experiences. States that before could only be accessedthrough dreams, meditation, or certain other spiritual disciplines could now beattained through drugs. That did not make the territory any less fascinating,confusing, or terrifying. Like R. E. Schultes in his trailblazing studies ofpsychedelic plants, Jung explored the terra incognita of the unconscious andreturned with some of the earliest reliable maps.For Terence and me, discovering Jung was a revelation. We were aware ofpsychedelics by then, of course, and deeply interested in what qualified as acultural phenomenon. If cosmology was the lens through which we learned to viewthe universe at large, Jungian psychology became our cosmology for the universewithin. Buried in every person’s neural tissue was a dimension at least as vastand fascinating as that of the stars and galaxies. We knew the cosmic frontierwould, for now, remain beyond our reach; humanity had to contemplate andconstruct its models of that from afar. The universe of the unconscious wasdifferent, being right there for exploration; and psychedelics were the chemicalstarships for bearing us inward. It wasn’t for nothing that the psychedelicexperience was called a “trip.” With such drugs suddenly available, many of ourgeneration opted to take the journey.Jungian thought forms a fertile environment for any student of the mind, oranyone wanting to make sense of their psychedelic experiences. For Terence andme, there were certain key Jungian concepts that proved indispensable ingrappling with what we eventually encountered at La Chorrera. Jung was one ofthe few Western scholars who had looked at Eastern spiritual traditions fortheir insights on the nature of mind and consciousness.Consider the I Ching, the ancient Chinese oracle based on sixty-four hexagramsthat became the basis for Terence’s Timewave Zero theory. Jung’s understandingof the I Ching was tied to his idea of “synchronicity,” or the occurrence of twoevents that are somehow related but not in terms of cause and effect. He alsoreferred to this notion as an “acausal connecting principle” or “meaningfulparallellism.” Synchronicity is not just random coincidence; rather, it is aphenomenon that expresses both in the mind and in the outer world, in a way thatreveals a meaningful but not causal tie between these expressions. The conceptprovides a rationale for the apparent effectiveness of oracles and otherdivinatory systems, like the Tarot and astrology. The hexagram patterns derivedfrom the I Ching in response to a question are meaningful (usually) because theyresonate with something that pre-exists in the mind, below conscious awareness.The I Ching clarifies that relationship and triggers an “ah-ha” moment. Or one’shoroscope is meaningful, not because the stars and planets control humandestiny, but because the archetypal processes they symbolically reflectcorrespond to subjective interpretations of character. In this respect, thenotion of synchronicity is quite profound, in that it asserts a correspondencebetween the mind and the external world—the so-called “real” world. The Hermeticphilosophers said it well: As above, so below.This mirroring of inner consciousness and the outer world still poses aconundrum for neuroscience and most Western philosophy. Why, and how, doexternal events meaningfully relate to inner, psychic events? It’s as ifconsciousness, or mind, forms the primary ground of being, while the physicalworld is secondary—a construct created by the mind. Any Eastern spiritualtradition or philosophy will tell you this is the case. Western thought, withits emphasis on materialism, is uncomfortable with that notion. I’m not aware ofany finding in current neuroscience that resolves this question, at least notyet; but we do know enough about brain function to say with fair confidencethat, to some extent, the world we call “reality” is a construct of our brains.The brain assembles a coherent story (more or less) by combining sensoryexperience with memories, associations, interpretations, and intuitions, thenpresenting the result as the movie, or perhaps more accurately thehallucination, we inhabit. If psychedelics teach us anything, it’s how fragilethis constructed reality is, and how profoundly it can be distorted.Jung’s idea of synchronicity compels us to think about the correspondencesbetween the inner and outer world, and to ponder our experience of time. Theother major elements of his model are his ideas about archetypes and thecollective unconscious. For Jung, it is as if the mind is a real place, a realmpopulated by archetypes that reside in some lower psychic stratum all humansshare. This is the collective unconscious. In such a view, the idea that each ofus is a separate individual is an illusion. We are like an archipelago risingfrom the sea; on the surface we appear to be separate islands, but underneath weare all connected by a common substrate. This is the best conceptualization Ihave found of the collective unconscious; oddly enough, it comes not from Jungbut from Arthur C. Clarke in Childhood’s End. I would like to think that Clarkehad read some Jung in his day. Archetypes swim in the surrounding psychicocean—symbolic constructs shared by all humanity as a result of our commongenetics, physiology, evolution, and brain architecture. Jung’s archetypes areclosely akin to Platonic ideals in that they are never apprehended directly; wesee, in effect, the shadows they cast. But because archetypes are sharedelements of the collective unconscious, they are expressed in every culture,albeit “tarted up” with historic and mythic trappings that may be unique toeach. Whatever the superficial differences in expression, there are universalarchetypes at play just below. The figures of the wise old man, the wise oldwoman, the demon, the trickster, the hero, the child—all are common archetypesexpressed in different but recognizable forms.And not all archetypes are people. The world tree is an archetype, for instance,as is the mountain, the lake, the abyss, the dragon, and so forth. Almost everysymbolic construct derives its meaning from its archetypal roots. One archetypeof great interest to Jung was the mandala. A mandala is a four-part, usuallycircular but sometimes quadrangular design that Jung equated to the archetype ofthe individuated self. Mandalas are universal in human cultures; examples arethe equilateral cross, Buddhist thangkas, Tibetan sand paintings, Siouxdreamcatchers, and Celtic knots. In Jungian psychology, individuation is thetherapeutic goal, the outcome of balancing and integrating the four primaryqualities of personality (intuition, sensation, emotion, cognition) with one’smale and female aspects (the anima and animus) and the elements of theunconscious (the shadow). The individuated person is a fully realized person,aware of both the personal and the collective aspects of the self. Individuationis pursued, though rarely achieved, through a lifetime of discipline andself-actualization. In this regard, two other Jungian concepts exerted undue influence on Terenceand me, or at least figured prominently in our experiences at La Chorrera. Onewas Jung’s speculation that flying saucers were contemporary expressions of themandala form and its inner meaning. Steeped as we were in science fiction,cosmology, and psychedelics, Terence and I were quite taken by this theory,which Jung presented in Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in theSkies, first published in German in 1958. A 1959 English translation was laterincluded in Volume Ten of Jung’s Collected Works, Civilization in Transition(1964.) Jung argued that flying saucers weren’t from outer space, but innerspace. He proposed that UFOs, those circular, mandalic symbols of wholeness,were shared hallucinations generated by an increasingly desperate collectiveunconscious seeking our attention in a world on the brink of nuclearcatastrophe. Jung didn’t dismiss these sightings; he felt they carried animportant message—humanity needed to wake up and get its act together in orderto avoid destroying the planet.Interestingly, and oddly, many people, myself among them, have gotten a similarmessage from their experiences with “plant teachers” like ayahuasca. Whetherthis has always been the lesson of such substances or a more recent phenomenonis unclear—in fact, that would make an interesting study. But I digress. As towhether flying saucers might be actual objects, Jung didn’t really say. Byartfully dodging the question, he seemed to hold out the remote possibility thatmaybe, just maybe, they were physically real. (I wonder what Jung would havemade of crop circles, had he been around to see them.) In leaving the door ajar,he implicitly acknowledged the connection between mind and matter, and theprimacy of mind. He may have thought that under some circumstances flyingsaucers could physically manifest. They were not extraterrestrial ships, butsomething material that the mind created.Needless to say, this notion held great fascination for us; it suggested that itmight be possible to build such an object, perhaps by transforming one’s bodyinto something like a UFO. And there were plenty of hints about how this mightbe done in both Western and Eastern traditions. In esoteric Christianity, theidea of the “resurrection body,” the physically transformed body afterresurrection, was something almost like a cyborg UFO; indeed, in some depictionsit is portrayed as circular. Many other esoteric traditions allude to somethingsimilar. Though they differ in the particulars, they share the notion that alifetime of spiritual discipline, usually including physical practices such asyoga, can result not only in an enlightened mind but a transformed body. In theEast, this concept is variously represented in Taoism, Sufism, Hermeticism, andcertain schools of Buddhism. Many shamanic traditions have developed similarconcepts; shamanic initiation entails the novice being torn asunder andreassembled, often with magical objects such as crystals or darts incorporatedinto the new, more powerful body.These upgrades function as technology; they are the basis of the shaman’s newpowers. In all these traditions, we find hints, even explicit instructions,regarding such biophysical technology, a set of techniques that can transformthe body into something transcendent, immortal, and endowed with superhumanabilities. These concepts were extremely numinous for Terence and me, and verymuch in play at La Chorrera. Someone stumbling on an account of our “experiment”there could be excused for thinking we were completely delusional, and we mayhave been. But we shared that delusion with a long line of spiritual masters.Alchemy was the other one of Jung’s preoccupations that captivated us. Thealchemist is generally regarded as a medieval precursor to the modern chemist, afigure engaged in the ultimately futile business of smelting, purifying, orotherwise turning various substances into gold. In fact, many early alchemistssubjected all sorts of matter—plants, metals, minerals, even feces and bodilyfluids—to a bewildering variety of bizarre manipulations. Over time, theymastered many chemical transformations and learned a great deal about matter,almost accidentally laying the foundations of modern chemistry in the process.But as Jung portrayed alchemy, it had very little to do with chemistry. Rather,it was yet another technique for spiritual transformation and achievingindividuation. The alchemists often used a set of allegorical symbols andiconography drawn from their nascent grasp of chemistry, concepts like firing,hardening, purification, condensation, and distillation. But Jung insisted thatthe significance of these procedures was primarily symbolic. The chemicaltransmutations effected in the alembic were reflections of psychic processes,transformations taking place in the spirit, or soul, of the alchemist. But hereagain, some of their writings hinted at techniques for physical perfection, notunlike those texts associated with concepts akin to the resurrection body. Inother words, the pursuits of physical and spiritual refinement were alloyed.Jung asserts that alchemy had nothing to do with transmuting lead into gold;that notion was almost a deliberate obfuscation of what was really going on. Thebigger prize was the “philosopher’s stone.” The philosopher’s stone was notsimply a lump of alchemical gold; it was a technological artifact of some sort.In fact, the substance in question was the ultimate technological artifact,because it could “do” anything that could be imagined. In this, the stone hasmuch in common with other imagined super-technologies such as flying saucers,starships, time machines, crystal balls, magic mirrors, and so on. All areconceived as artifacts, invented (or conjured) by man that can do things wenormally regard as impossible. Only in an era familiar with nanotechnology,artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and quantum technologies, can wenow contemplate actually building devices whose power approaches that attributedto the philosopher’s stone.Does the enduring allure of concepts like the resurrection body and thephilosopher’s stone suggest they might be more than just delusions? Terencewould say they were anticipations of future events, a potent shock waveresonating back through history, beckoning us, luring us, toward theirinevitable invention or discovery. (The question of whether one “invents” or“discovers” something like a philosopher’s stone is one we’ll leave unexaminedfor now.) Perhaps someday we will produce our own. The fact that we now live inan age where we might actually diagram such a thing says something profound, andperhaps disturbing, about human imagination—and hubris.This discussion of alchemy requires a further comment. At La Chorrera, Terenceand I thought we could build the philosopher’s stone (the flying saucer, thetime machine, the eschaton, insert your preference here) out of our own bodies,literally singing it into existence through a superconducting fusion of our ownDNA with that of a mushroom. In the sober light of today, four decades later,this seems like an utterly crazy notion; but considered in the context ofalchemy and other esoteric traditions, the notion is completely in line, thoughexpressed in modern terms. Crazy we may have been; but again, if so, we were inthe company of many great visionaries and spiritual masters throughout history.Alchemists, or many of them, used an essentially empirical approach to pursuetheir art. Perhaps not fully aware of what they were doing, they mixed andmelded matter, then observed the results, interpreting what they saw asreflections of inner, psychological processes. But given that their rawmaterials—the prima materia—were often derived from plants and animals, couldthey have accidentally (or deliberately, once trial and error had yielded someresult) succeeded in isolating or concentrating psychedelic substances? Andhaving ingested their handiwork, wouldn’t they have interpreted the effect as acomplete success? Even now, with all our sophistication about chemistry andpharmacology, who cannot be impressed with Albert Hofmann’s “accidental”discovery of LSD, or the marvelous molecules invented by Alexander “Sasha”Shulgin? In a sense, their finds, or creations, exemplify the union of spiritand matter that the alchemists sought. By that measure at least, they might becalled the alchemists of their day.The tryptamine-based psychedelics are widespread in plant and animal life, as aresult of the tryptamine molecule’s close relationship to tryptophan, which isuniversally distributed in organisms. Tryptamines are alkaloids and thusrelatively easy to isolate using simple chemical techniques that would have beenavailable to the early alchemists—just look at any issue of The Entheogen Review(now defunct but available online) or visit the Erowid library (erowid.org) tofind the methods devised by their modern counterparts! Given the array ofmaterials and manipulations used by alchemists in the past, it strikes me asplausible that a few may have stumbled onto these substances. We have no proof,of course, though there are many bizarre depictions of animals and plants inalchemical iconography. Even these are mere hints, not explicit depictions.Alchemy was an esoteric practice, after all. Its practitioners were notinterested in divulging their secrets, and often went to great lengths toobfuscate them. I am no expert on such illustration, but the closest example Ihave seen to an explicit visual reference to psychedelics is a remarkablewoodcut in Johann Daniel Mylius’s Philosophia Reformata, a text from 1622. Thefour women depicted represent the four stages of the alchemical transformationprocess; the patterns of the folds of their dresses appear to be a taxonomicallyaccurate representation of Psilocybe semilanceata, known as liberty caps amongmushroom enthusiasts. This species is tiny, potent, and common in pasturesthroughout Europe and the British Isles, and there’s no reason to think ithasn’t grown there for centuries.Perhaps some people understood the mushroom’s properties and used such imageryas a way of alluding to their secret knowledge. (One of my students astutelynoted that the women’s headdresses might represent the seed capsules of theopium poppy, another possibility.) Granted, one must be aware of the tendency tosee what one wants to see in ancient iconography—a tendency that appears to beparticularly strong among those with a special interest in mushrooms, as theauthor Andy Letcher points out in Shroom: A Cultural History of the MagicMushroom. Nevertheless, the resemblance is remarkable, and readers may drawtheir own conclusions.Before leaving Jung, it’s worth noting that he considered his work to bescientific. He made a point of insisting that his theories were objectivelydrawn, based on scientific observation. Indeed, Jungian psychology began as aneffort to provide an interpretative structure for what he and others had learnedby observing themselves as well as their patients. As he argued, the Westdevalues inner experience; only what is external, material, and outside the selfcan qualify as real. But in Eastern thought the opposite is true. The real worldin Hinduism, for example, is the inner world; the external world, the materialworld, is maya, illusion. To illustrate the reality of the universe within, Jungnoted how often our actions in the external world stem from interior motivationsand ideas. This is an important point, particularly when interpreting innerstates, including psychedelic states, which are easily dismissed as not real.Jung would vehemently disagree with such appraisals. As he pointed out, innerexperiences are often more profound and significant than external events, interms of their influence on human activities and institutions. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 18 - The Ladders of Ecstasy: Mircea Eliade Terence and I found another important “virtual mentor” in the writer andphilosopher Mircea Eliade. Born in Romania in 1907, Eliade attended theUniversity of Bucharest and spent several years studying in Calcutta, India. Hisearly work included journalism, novels, and essays, some of which were latercriticized for espousing anti-Semitic and extreme right-wing views. AfterRomania became a Communist country in 1945, Eliade lived for a time in Parisbefore moving to the United States. From 1964 until his death in 1986, he was aprofessor of the history of religions at the University of Chicago.Eliade’s vast output ranged from fantasy fiction to scholarly works to whatmight be called armchair anthropology. Neither Terence nor I made much of a dentin all that; the books that stood out for us were Shamanism: Archaic Techniquesof Ecstasy (1964) and Yoga: Immortality and Freedom (1958). We also werefamiliar with The Myth of the Eternal Return: Or, Cosmos and History (1954) andThe Sacred and the Profane: the Nature of Religion (1959). We weren’t aware ofhis early, unsavory political opinions, let alone the debate over how those mayhave influenced his later work. Indeed, much of that critique had yet to bearticulated. We were aware that many of his ideas fit in well with those ofJung, whose works we managed to explore more extensively.Jung and Eliade met in 1950, at the Eranos Conference, a yearly lecture seriesin Switzerland, and the two subsequently collaborated as colleagues and friends.By the time Terence and I discovered Eliade’s writings, we were both steeped inthe ideas of transcendence and self-transformation, and his thoughts on yoga andshamanism complemented our interests. Originally published in French, and asearly as the 1930s in the case of his yoga studies, these works were (and stillare) important scholarly contributions, although they are now a bit dated. Forexample, Eliade asserted, without evidence, that a shamanic tradition thatrelied on “narcotics” (meaning “psychedelics,” a term not yet coined) was a“degenerate” tradition born of an earlier, more pristine practice that hadbecome corrupted. Our own experiences with psychedelics obviously led us todisagree.Since then, research on what is now known to be the worldwide phenomenon ofshamanism has further discredited his assertion. Though certainly not allshamans use psychoactive substances, those who do use them cannot be regarded as“degenerate.” The antiquity and prevalence of these substances would indicatethat they are the sine qua non of shamanic practice, at least in the New World.That might be true of Old World shamanism as well, though the knowledge may havebeen lost much earlier there. This would account for the greater use ofpsychedelic, or hallucinogenic, plants in the New World compared to the Old, atopic about which Schultes and others have written. One could actually arguethat shamanic traditions that do not use psychedelics are “degenerate,”representing, as they may, the loss of earlier knowledge—namely, the identity ofthe shamanic plants and the methods of their preparation. But here we should becareful not to commit the error Eliade made when he dismissed “narcotic”shamanic traditions. We may speculate that some traditions lost this knowledge,as suggested by, for example, soma, a drink of unknown composition mentioned incertain Indian texts and elsewhere. But concrete evidence is hard to come by.Eliade’s writings on yoga and shamanism as techniques of spiritual and perhapsphysical transformation added to what we’d learned from Jung, supplying us withspecific details from different traditions—the ethnographic backstory. We werealso drawn to what Eliade saw as the archaic distinction between the “sacred”and the “profane,” as applied to both space (places) and time (events). Manyspiritual traditions postulate separate or parallel worlds. There is themundane, ordinary world we inhabit while alive, which Eliade termed the“profane” realm. Adjacent to this world are other “sacred” realms that arenormally unseen and inaccessible to ordinary people, but which are reachable byshamans and other spiritual practitioners. These sacred realms may be thedwelling place of souls awaiting incarnation, or where souls go followingdeath—for example, “heaven” in the Christian mythos. In many cultures, the worldis understood to have a three-layered structure. The middle layer is thematerial world, which lies below a celestial realm inhabited by gods andadvanced beings, and above an underworld inhabited by demons or other malevolententities. While this lower realm may be infernal, it is nonetheless viewed assacred in its separation from the world of everyday life.In many cosmologies, these realms are linked by an axis mundi, which is oftendepicted as a world tree. The concept is also portrayed at times as a mushroomin Siberian shamanic traditions that use the fly agaric (Amanita muscaria), oras the ladder-like ayahuasca vine familiar to shamans in the Amazon Basin. Inall such traditions, the shaman can access the upper and lower realms, either byusing a psychoactive substance to induce an altered state or relying on other“techniques of ecstasy,” as Eliade describes them. In the ecstatic condition,the shaman might ascend the axis mundi to propitiate the gods or entities in theupper realm, or descend to the lower realm, often to do battle with malevolententities, retrieve the souls of the sick, or otherwise intervene on behalf ofindividuals or the tribal community. The key concept here is that both upper andlower realms are intimately linked with the mundane human realm, and can beaccessed by people with the right training (shamans) and the right tools (often,drugs). I might add that these realms, which amount to other dimensions, arejust as “real” as the material world, but the term would be useless in thiscontext.Just as there is sacred space, so there is sacred time—another idea thatinfluenced our thinking. Sacred time is a time out of time, the time of ritual.Sacred time and sacred space are closely linked, because rituals performed insacred spaces, as they are in most traditions, similarly sacralize time. In anarchetypal sense, sacred space is not simply a consecrated or special place;rather, ritual transforms an ordinary place into the actual cosmic center, aplace outside profane space. Similarly, when a culture engages in a rebirthceremony or reenacts its creation myth, it doesn’t simply emulate events thattook place at the beginning of time; these rituals return their participants tothat moment when the cosmos was born. The event is literal, not metaphorical. Asacred ritual accomplishes what Eliade calls a “revalorization” of the sacredspace-time of the cosmos in which the culture dwells. It is literally a renewal,a rebirth, the beginning of a new cycle of birth, evolution, and death. Sacredtime is cyclical, not linear; and cultures that dwell in sacred time do not livein historical time, or indeed in mundane geography. They inhabit ahistoricaltime, in a place that is at the center of space and yet also removed from it.The cosmos is constantly being born, evolving, and dying, a cycle of “eternalreturn” that is the antithesis of our Western concept of historical time.The distinctions between sacred and profane have profoundly influenced theWestern worldview, especially as seen through the lens of the Judeo-Christiantradition. The realm where God dwells is a sacred cosmos, a place and timeoutside of history and location. It is, in fact, the place that we inhabitedbefore the fall, the human expulsion from Eden. That moment can be understood asthe fall into history. We ate the forbidden fruit of knowledge and came tounderstand our own mortality, our own death.Such knowledge is not possible in cyclical time; it depends critically on lineartime, which by definition has a beginning, middle, and an end. Linear time is aprison in which humanity is entrapped; salvation consists of an escape fromhistory, a return to an eternal, timeless moment, an eternity spent in blissfulcontemplation of the Godhead. We are like a starship poised on the threshold ofa black hole’s event horizon; at that exact point in space-time one is neitherin this continuum nor out of it, but rather exists in an eternal moment in whichtime is literally stopped. Death is indefinitely postponed, as is birth, or anyother kind of change. It’s a pretty boring place, but not really, because for itto be boring, time must pass, and it does not. I find it extremely strange thatblack holes, or that region near to black holes known as the event horizon, areactually physical manifestations of this “mythical” concept of a sacred,timeless, space-less point. Perhaps the old cosmological myths were closer tothe truth than we might think.This notion, of an escape from history being the equivalent of salvation, is thewhole story of Christianity in a nutshell. Adam and Eve ate the fruit of thetree of knowledge and fell into history, into mortality. Christ, the shamanicpsychopomp, had to separate himself from the father and descend into history. Hehad to take on death itself. In dying, he died for all of humanity, and in beingreborn he defeated death for all of humanity. Our lives still unfold in history,in linear time, of course; but at the end, if we die in a state of grace, we canreturn to that sacred space-time point that is, literally, the instant ofcreation and that is, literally, the center of the universe (because at themoment of creation the universe is a point, as our cosmological physicistsinsist).Thanks to Christ’s descent from heaven to defeat death, the Christian isliberated from the prison of history, because the collective curse, the originalsin that was cast upon humanity and led to expulsion from the Garden of Eden,has been absolved by Christ’s death. In the Roman Catholic tradition, thesacrament of confession gives a person the chance to do on a small, individualscale what Christ did for all humanity: descend into history and return to thebeginning, to a pristine, renewed, reborn state in which all the baggage of ourhistory (our sins) is washed away and forgotten. Inevitably, however, we repeatthe primal mistake that Adam and Eve made and descend again into memory andhistorical time. It’s a pretty profound myth, actually. It is “true” in that metaphysical sensein which all myths are true. And it has greatly impacted the way that we in theWest view history and the “profane,” everyday world in which we live outhistory, personal and otherwise. Christianity encourages, nay demands, that inorder to achieve salvation, good Christians should keep their sights set firmlyon eternity, on the hoped-for moment of eternal bliss that is beyond death,beyond time. In exchange, we are expected to devalue and even reject thephysical world in which we inhabit a body and experience all the suffering andpleasure that bodies can experience. We are told that we should not indulge intoo much sex, too much eating, too many pleasures of the flesh, because to do sowill make us forget that eternal bodiless state of bliss that we long for. Weare encouraged to devalue this world, even disrespect it, because it ishistorical and must end someday. In fact, the sooner it ends the better, in theChristian worldview, because that will mark the return of Christ to Earth, theFinal Days, and the crossing of the threshold into the post-historical eternity,the eschaton, the end of the world.As a myth, this is all very well. Who doesn’t long for an escape from history,for immortality and eternal bliss? The problem with the Christian mythos, amongother belief systems, is that it can lead to a denial of biology, and arejection of all that is good about being a living organism. After all, despiteits terrible problems, the world is a marvelous place, and being alive is amarvelous state. For 2,000 years, the church has foisted what amounts to a Ponzischeme on the frightened masses, bidding them to forego satisfaction now inexchange for a greater fulfillment after death. If, that is, they’ve toed theline as defined by the church and what Terence called its “beastly littlepriestlies.” Locating the purpose of life somewhere beyond it is a dangerousform of thought, especially in an age when some not only want to end history,but also could attain the technology to do so. It’s also irresponsible toindulge such conceits on a planet whose seven billion human inhabitants aredepleting most of its resources and poisoning what remains.And yet such thinking seems justified to many political leaders, some of whom,being fundamentalist zealots themselves, see no reason to preserve nature ormaintain global stability. Freedom of religious belief is a constitutionalright, and people are free to believe in whatever delusions they want. But whenit comes to forging national policies based on those delusions (for instance,the denial of climate change) then thinking citizens must stand up and denouncesuch ignorance. The sad thing is there are fewer and fewer thinking citizens, orso it appears. A frightened populace just wants to be told what to think and do,and the ideologues are more than happy to oblige them. One result is a trend inthe public sphere toward the glorification of a willful shallow-mindedness. Inthe private sphere, that often manifests itself as a conscious refusal toacknowledge the mind’s unconscious depths.One antidote to both that refusal and to irrational religiosity might bepsychedelics. There’s reason to believe these substances played a role in theorigin of religion—not a particular religion, but the religious impulse itself,the experience of the transcendent. That’s why these substances are considereddangerous and their usage so often suppressed. For the religious powers that be,psychedelics are dangerous, not because of any toxicity or physiological threat,but because they so often demonstrate the superfluity of faith. To have faith isto believe in something despite the absence of evidence. All religions demandfaith from their followers; unquestioning, irrational belief is the tool bywhich hierarchical religions control their adherents.No wonder psychedelics are threatening to an authoritarian religious hierarchy.You don’t need faith to benefit from a psychedelic experience, let alone apriest or even a shaman to interpret it. What you need is courage—courage todrink the brew, eat the mushroom, or whatever it is, and then to pay attention,and make of it what you will. Suddenly, the tools for direct contact with thetranscendent other (whether you call it God or something else) is taken from thehands of an anointed elite and given to the individual seeker. The psychedelicexperience is nothing if not intensely personal. Many will be quite willing tointerpret it for you, of course; psychedelic spirituality is hardly immune to“guruism.” This is not the fault of psychedelics, but of the human impulse toseize upon anything numinous and use it to gain power. That’s what the earlychurch fathers did with the original, numinous experiences that form thehistorical precedents of Christianity (and which may well have beenpsychedelically triggered). Certain demagogues are doing the same today whenthey frighten their followers into embracing agendas that threaten not onlytheir individual interests, but that all of earthly life.Many will discover that the take-home lesson from their brush with the numinousis a celebration, not a rejection, of biology. Psychedelics are drugs; they dowhat they do because we are made of drugs. You can’t get more biological thanthat! Psychedelic experiences are usually not about visiting some transcendentrealm of angels and demons (though that does happen); more often than not, theyare about experiencing the here and now in a very intense way. Be here now, thistimeless moment: These phrases are so much associated with psychedelicexperiences they’ve become clichés. But they well describe what profoundpsychedelic experiences are like: an immersion in the moment and a sense of“oceanic boundlessness,” a sense of being one with nature, connected to all ofnature and all other beings.It’s quite unlikely one would return from that experience compelled to rejectnature and biology, much less one’s own body. Rather, the outcome is an enhancedreverence for nature and our place in that scheme, a feeling that as part of it,we must love it, and learn to nurture it. The psychedelic revelation is theexact opposite of the fundamentalist, apocalyptic view that we should long forrelease from this “vale of tears” and ascend into some anticipatedpost-historical eternity, which our religious authorities tell us is waiting forus following death. What psychedelics teach us is that we are already inparadise, as manifested in earthly life. Having learned that lesson, we thenmust assume the responsibility of protecting nature, the only paradise we arecertain we’ll ever know. While the worldview that Terence and I shared certainly owed much to Jung andEliade, there were of course other influences. During a period of intenseinterest in philosophy, I read most of Plato’s dialogues, some of Aristotle, agood deal of St. Augustine, and a smattering of Locke, Descartes, Kant, andother dead white men. I briefly aspired to study classics at Trinity College inDublin, but after struggling to learn Greek in my first semester at theUniversity of Colorado in Boulder, I gave that up. In any case, by then I’dalready begun to find science and anthropology more interesting.During his first year in the experimental college, Terence discoveredphenomenology through the works of Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and MauriceMerleau-Ponty—then brought their ideas home to me. I found them exotic andchallenging but quite compatible with Jung’s assertion that inner experiencesshould not be dismissed as “unreal” simply because they were immaterial.Anything consciously experienced was “real” in the sense that it could beexperienced, even if it had no connection to anything beyond the subjectiverealm. Like Jung, these thinkers were attempting to bring objectivity to thestudy of those aspects of consciousness that are usually regarded as subjective,such as dreams, emotions, and intuitions.Phenomenology is the study of “lived experience” and is rooted in the concept of“intentionality,” sometimes called “aboutness.” Consciousness is alwaysconsciousness of something. Intentionality represents an alternative to therepresentational theory of consciousness, which holds that no thing can beexperienced directly; only the representation of that thing in the mind can beexperienced. Phenomenology turns this thought on its head and asserts that thereis nothing but direct experience; whatever is presented to the mind is the gristof experience. Husserl argued that consciousness is not “in” the mind but ratheris “of” the intentional object. Consciousness amounts to what is experienced,whether that is a solid, material object or a figment of the imagination. Thephenomenological method relies on the description of phenomena as they are givento consciousness in their immediacy, without making judgments about whether theyare subjective or not.The preceding paragraph is a simplistic synopsis of some difficult concepts Idon’t pretend to completely understand. I won’t clumsily attempt to explicatethem at greater length; the present description is clumsy enough. The point isthat, together with Jung and Eliade, phenomenology was an appealing perspectivefrom which to approach the “phenomena” experienced in psychedelic states. Thoseexperiences may seem implausible, indeed impossible, but that doesn’tmatter—anything that can be experienced is real and should be approached on itsown terms. So much for the artists and thinkers that led us to the upper Amazon and helpedprepare us for the strange events we encountered there. Awakened as kids to themysteries of the cosmos, we convinced ourselves as teenagers that we mightpossibly solve them; a few years later we found ourselves in the Colombianjungle believing we actually had. Upon our return, Terence and I began exploringa new set of thinkers and concepts as we struggled to make sense of ourexperiences. One important influence would be the work of the mathematician andphilosopher Alfred North Whitehead. His concept of how “novelty” enters andtransfigures nature would play a role in shaping our journey’s most prominentartifact: Terence’s Timewave Zero theory. Terence’s effort to chart thestructure of time would lead him to predict a series of dates for the end oftime, including one famously slated for the winter solstice in 2012. Ourthinking would eventually diverge on certain issues, the timewave among them,but those developments lay beyond La Chorrera, as we shall see. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 19 - Summer of Love: 1967 In late June, 1967, I managed to escape Paonia for three glorious weeks withTerence in California. My partner in this scheme was my friend Tom, he of thePlymouth coupe, who seemed more mature than the others in our band and subjectto fewer constraints at home. Our parents should have had their heads examinedfor letting us go, but for some reason they did. We arrived in Berkeley in earlyJuly.By then Terence had moved into the so-called Telegraph House, a huge,three-story communal place on Telegraph Avenue just a few blocks down from thecommercial section. The house was the epicenter of an eclectic scene ofwild-eyed freaks, dealers, travelers, and other characters in the Bay Arealooking for fun, sex, drugs, and whatever else was to be had. Crashing in anopen room, Tom and I were up for all that and more.Terence fit right into this scene. His room had become a sort of informal salonwhere people would show up to get loaded and stay to hear him rant. And healways had something to rant about. Unlike most people, who get high and growquiet, cannabis never affected Terence that way; it only made him morearticulate, more talkative, and more able to weave his enrapturing narratives.He often had a receptive audience of very stoned listeners hardly able to speakor move while he regaled them. He was in his element, and he loved it. That mayhave been when Terence first realized he had the gift of gab, in spades. Peoplejust loved to hear him talk; he could keep a group seated on the floor in hisbedroom spellbound for hours. It didn’t really matter what he said; it was theway he said it. Much later in his life when Terence started to address largergroups in more structured venues, he found the old magic still worked, a talenthe eventually leveraged into his public career.Terence was still seeing his girlfriend Elaine at the time, but she must havegone home for the summer. Many of his other friends stopped by, a few of whomI’d later get to know quite well. Some were former high school classmates who,like Terence, were in Berkeley going to the university or just hanging out.Others he knew from the Tussman program. Michael, for instance, was a Berkeleyboy; his parents’ home was the one that later burned down, taking Terence’sfirst library with it. Michael certainly didn’t fit the profile of thedown-and-dirty hippie. With his neatly trimmed beard he looked like anElizabethan scholar and had the eloquence and learning to match. He eventuallymoved to New York City and became a successful dealer and curator of Asian art.Another friend, Rick, had been a brilliant classmate of Terence’s during hisyear in Mountain View. Rick eventually moved to England and became a successfuldealer of rare scientific books. At the time, Terence admired him for teachingan advanced course in steroid chemistry at Stanford while apparently still ahigh-school junior.A third participant was “Vanessa,” a lovely, brown-eyed girl from New York. Afellow student at the experimental college, she shared Terence’s intensity andpassion for ideas. I’ve adopted the pseudonym Terence gave her in TrueHallucinations both to honor her role in our band of adventurers, and to protecther identity, which she’d probably appreciate as a respected psychotherapist.Vanessa was (and still is) a key member of the Brotherhood of the ScreamingAbyss. The Telegraph House is also where I first met Erik, an aspiring poet andwriter who had been Terence’s best buddy during his senior year in Lancaster,and Lisa, who later became my first serious girlfriend. In 1967, however,neither of us suspected that might happen, let alone that Lisa and Erik wouldeventually marry. Like Michael, they remained close to Terence until the end ofhis life.At the time, Lisa was the girlfriend of the remarkable John Parker, a guy whohad an enormous influence on both Terence and me. He’d been another quirky,brilliant, junior-year classmate of Terence’s in Mountain View. I’d met John theprevious summer when he’d spent a few days in Paonia visiting Terence. I was shyand didn’t talk to him much at the time, but later he became one of my mostimportant mentors. John did not affect the beard and long hair that wasfashionable at the time. He had a diminutive physique and a perpetual twinkle inhis eye; his sexuality was ambiguous, a puzzle. He brought to mind what peoplemight cruelly mean when they refer to a gay person as a “fairy,” though hesomehow embodied the more literal meaning of the term. John’s father, aresearcher at the NASA facility in Mountain View, was known, if I recall, forhis work on the fire-retardant paint used in certain spacecraft—a modernalchemist if there ever was one. I only met him once, years later, in 1984, whenI was in California searching for jobs after completing my Ph.D. Though hestruck me as an odd but harmless fellow in our brief interview, Lisa had aharsher view of him. According to her, if John was a tad eccentric, even a bitmad, his father was partly why.Whether John got all or some of his funny ideas from his father, he was afascinating and peculiar figure in his own right. He knew about and practicedblack magic, or so he claimed. He was sophisticated about drugs, having triedmany kinds, including some I’d never heard of. He knew botany and medicinalplants, chemistry, psychopharmacology, alchemy, yoga, and shamanism. He had veryunconventional ideas about drug actions, space and time, other dimensions,aliens, and UFOs. John deserves credit for planting the seeds of many keyconcepts in my mind over several years of intense correspondence. Many of theideas we discussed in those letters figured in the conceptual raft that Terenceand I constructed before our journey to La Chorrera. All that occurred later,most notably in the fall of 1969 during my first semester at the University ofColorado at Boulder when John spent several weeks visiting me. The extraordinarydiscussions we had then over many a hashish-stoked evening were the culminationof our long correspondence. Though John did not accompany us to South America,we may never have gone without him; his spirit was with us all the way. If Tom and I had any agenda in Berkeley that summer, it was fairly loose. Wewanted, if possible, to get laid, and there seemed a good chance that wouldhappen, what with free love in the air and all. Or so it seemed to a randysixteen-year-old, but it never happened. We also wanted to take LSD and secure asupply of cannabis and other interesting substances to bring back to ourfriends. At all that we succeeded.At some point in our visit, Terence urged us to cross the bay and check out thescene in Haight-Ashbury. He probably just wanted to get us out of his hair for afew days, but he wanted us to investigate the Diggers. The San Francisco Diggershad taken their name and philosophy from a mid-seventeenth-century group inEngland first known as the True Levellers for their radical egalitarian beliefs,which involved common ownership of property and respect for nature. They becameknown as the Diggers for their habit of working together in their communalfields. Their hippie counterparts, based in the Haight, gave that ethos an urbanspin, opening stores that gave away their stocks and providing free medicalcare, food, transport, and housing. They also organized free concerts andpolitical street theater, such as the Death of Money parade. They envisioned asociety free of money, private property, and all forms of buying and selling.In many ways, the Diggers tried to actualize the best ideals of hippiedom. Likemost utopian communities, however, they found it difficult to make reality fitwith the ideal. Inevitably, they seem to founder on the recalcitrance of humannature. For every idealist who is ready to pitch in and work for the commongood, there is an opportunist who wants something for nothing, or, worse, tograb power and bend it to his or her own ends. The Diggers were a kind ofcult—not a religious but a political cult—and eventually they suffered the fateof all cults. But at the time, the Diggers were happening in the Haight, and itwas a beautiful idea.Tom and I couldn’t really connect; we may have been guilty of wanting somethingfor nothing. Certainly we had very little money, and we needed a place to stay,food, all those necessities, and we had little to contribute. After a few dayswe decided it wasn’t working for us, and we returned to Berkeley.Even then you could discern the seeds of destruction in the hippie movement,most notably in the Haight. Trying to run an egalitarian community in a densecity is a challenge under the best of circumstances. And every community thataspires to be spontaneous, to thrive without leaders or hierarchies, mustconfront the vacuum it creates for the power-crazed. Another factor thatcontributed to the short life of the hippie movement, at least in the Haight,was that so many of the people who had been drawn there were already damaged insome way. They made the pilgrimage in search of something, though many knew notwhat. Once they arrived, they were likely to become exposed to drugs and otherexperiences that they had no tools to deal with, and no clue. Those peoplequickly became dysfunctional and a liability to the rest of the community. Noteveryone suffered this fate, of course. In fact, most people who were motivatedenough to make the pilgrimage to California that summer probably benefited fromtheir experience.Back in Berkeley, we were able to realize our goal of finding some acid. At thetime there was little or no quality control on what was available. The LSD oftoday is pharmaceutical grade compared with what was on the street then. Therewas no problem locating it; just about every other person you encountered on the“Ave.” had something to sell. We bought a couple of tabs of what looked likeaspirin, and were aspirin, but with a tiny dot of some purple substance added inthe center. This was the famous, legendary LSD, a couple hundred “mikes”—ormicrograms—according to the hirsute stranger who had sold it to us, and whovouched for its purity and potency. We had no way to know, but it was the Summerof Love, man; surely no one would sell us bad stuff! In this case, we werelucky. The dealer was as good as his word, as we found out a few days later.We did not go off half-cocked. We had read The Psychedelic Experience, the LSDuser’s guide, and took it all very seriously. I wrote a long, rambling letter tomy friend Gary back in Paonia ruminating on the death-rebirth experience, abouthow one must be prepared to face death and lose the fear of it if one is to bereborn. It was a long, soul-searching screed, but at least it showed I wasn’ttaking the event lightly.On the appointed day we made our way up to Tilden Park, a lovely spot in thehills above Berkeley, and found a secluded glen where we wouldn’t be disturbed.We dropped the acid and waited. I think we were expecting an inner journeyfilled with visions and cosmic insights. What we got was more like a regressionto a primate state. All the trappings of civilization fell away, all ourintellectual pretensions and expectations. We found ourselves in theprehistoric, pre-literate, pre-cognitive condition of ape-men. This includedhowling like monkeys, swinging from branches, beating hollow logs with sticks,and generally carrying on like wild men. It was a blast! The LSD seemed veryfriendly, and we became quite attuned to the surrounding nature; colors wereintensified, and trees and plants and insects were all revealed in microscopicdetail. It was a warm, sunny day, and we loved the feel of the sun on bare skin,loved the sensuality of moving, stretching, walking, and running. Having a body,being in a body, seemed like a wonderful thing. There was not a whiff of anxietyor fear. Our antics alternated with periods of rest when we’d sit in the shade,smoke a little cannabis, and rap. I don’t even remember what we discussed, butwhat we discovered were the first lessons of the first time with this gentle,wise teacher. And we discovered that she was feminine, and had a name: Alice D.We came back off the mountain literally feeling reborn. It was a wonderfulfirst-time experience, and we were grateful to the anonymous dealer, grateful tomy brother for hosting us, just grateful to the universe for being alive. We gotwhat we had come for, having crossed the threshold over to those who were“experienced.” We certainly hadn’t gone mad or suffered harm. In fact, we feltbetter than ever.The reality check came quickly, and from an unexpected direction, thanks to thatlong letter I’d sent Gary back in Paonia a few days earlier. Acting in thefoolish way that teenagers sometimes do, I didn’t address it to Gary, whichwould have been logical. Instead I addressed it, in a stilted way that made itseem more important, to “G. Edward,” a name Gary had used in a previouscorrespondence—and which turned out to be the way a long-dead uncle had writtenthe name they shared. The local postmaster, seeing the letter, duly delivered itnot to Gary but to his aged aunt. Such are the risks of small-town life, whereeverybody knows everybody. This good soul opened the letter and was, of course,appalled at my rant about love and death, rebirth and transformation. She lostno time in sharing her concern with Gary’s parents, who were even more alarmed;they apparently interpreted the letter as alluding to suicide. That was thefarthest thing from my mind when I wrote it, but now I see how it could havebeen a red flag for them, taken out of context. They were already suspicious ofme and took a dim view of my friendship with their son; this only confirmedtheir worst fears.Gary’s parents contacted my parents, and the leash tightened. Tom and I wereordered to return to Paonia, and we did. My father and I predictably had a hugefight over the debacle. He was enraged and fearful, I think, that mypreoccupations were more than a little unhealthy, if not indicative of a seriouspsychological problem. I tried to explain that the letter meant to bemetaphorical, its discussion abstract. I was not about to commit suicide; infact the LSD experience had left me cherishing life more than ever. But ourfather didn’t want to hear about that. Terence earned his share of opprobriumover the matter as well, for having allowed his little brother to stumble intoharm’s way. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 20 - The Secret Encountered The cloud of tension created by this incident lingered into the fall. I wasstarting my junior year, but most of my friends were seniors looking forward tograduation and escape. Communication with my father had reached a nadir. He wasgone most of the week, so my mother was left to deal with a kid who was gettingbig and hairy. Though inside I felt like a gentle flower child seeking only to“groove” and avoid conflict, I apparently had trouble conveying that as Itowered over my fragile, bird-like mom.Following our return from California it had emerged that the scourge was notlimited to Tom and me. Besides Gary, my friends Richard, Madeline, and Phil hadbeen implicated in my letter as well. While our little group had peripheralmembers, the six of us formed its core. As ostracized rebels we certainly didn’tfit the profile of our peers, who were too preoccupied with football and otherwholesome things like sex and drinking to be interested in something as horribleas “drugs.” Among our group of bad apples, I was the baddest of the bad, becauseI had brought this “garbage” from California and corrupted my friends.Richard was the friend I’d known the longest. That fall, his parents and minehad a tense meeting that went nowhere, mostly because my father could notdiscuss the matter without storming out of the room. To their credit, Richard’sparents seemed much more reasonable. Looking back, I’m a little puzzled as towhy the hammer didn’t come down harder. Not much could have been done; we werein the throes of teenage rebellion, and I think our parents were intimidated.The parents of others in our group really didn’t seem to care, or perhaps hadgiven up trying. The so-called “generation gap” seemed to have widenedeverywhere, and similar scenarios were surely playing out across the country.Despite our hasty retreat back to Paonia, Tom and I had accomplished ourobjective of securing more cannabis—a couple of lids, much better than thatfirst batch, but still terrible, I’d guess, by today’s standards. We also scoredhalf an ounce of hash, a few hits of acid, something we were told was mescalinebut probably wasn’t, and—the Holy Grail—half a gram of DMT. I’d bought a smallmetal opium pipe in Chinatown similar to the one Terence used for smoking hash.As far as our pharmacological adventures went, we were set.A few of us began finding excuses to take trips up Hubbard Creek, a nearby areaaccessible by a degraded but passable road. We passed these off as “fishingexpeditions,” which in a sense they were, but not in any stream—we were boundfor the ocean of mind. We dropped acid on one of these occasions, and our tripswere similar to what Tom and I had experienced in Berkeley.But DMT proved even more fascinating. In some ways, DMT is what this book is allabout. Terence and I were destined to become preoccupied with this substance;it’s what led us years later to the Amazon in search of the Secret. We didn’tknow what the Secret was, exactly, all we knew for sure was that there was aSecret, and that DMT was somehow the key. It beckoned to us like the glitteringjewel of a singularity, a beacon on the threshold of unimaginable dimensions atthe edge of space and time. More than forty years later, it’s still a mystery,and it still beckons, though in a different sense. I think it’s safe to say thathad it not been for DMT, our lives would have turned out quite differently. Theywould certainly have been more boring.I had first heard of DMT the previous summer, sitting on the blanket in the citypark enjoying cannabis for the first time. Terence spoke of it in hushed tones.He called it “the ultimate metaphysical reality pill,” though it wasn’t a pill,of course, it was something you smoked. He didn’t have any with him, but I wascaptivated by this description and wanted to try it. Terence insisted that DMTwas too much to handle without a lot more experience; I needed more exposure to“mild” hallucinogens before I was ready. As my mentor in all things psychedelic,I took his admonitions to heart. In any case, DMT was never easy to come by. Itwas rare and had a well-deserved reputation for being the ultimate psychedelic.People referred to DMT as “the businessman’s trip” because of its shortduration; you could smoke it on your lunch break and then return to work. Thatdidn’t explain why a businessman would want to return, much less remain abusinessman after gazing into the DMT abyss.But Terence had worked the network, and by the time we got to Berkeley thatsummer he’d secured several grams of DMT. It was a waxy, orange-colored pastewith a foul smell, like ozone, kind of like shit. Terence colorfully describedthe smell as that “of beryllium welding in interstellar space,” and a mere whiffof it seemed to hint at the cosmic dimensions it could open. Pure DMT is a whiteto off-white crystalline powder and is almost odorless. The stuff on the streetsback then was the product of sloppy syntheses, bathtub batches cooked up bycrazed chemists who couldn’t be bothered to clean up their product. It didn’tmatter. It delivered. During one of our long conversations in Terence’s room inBerkeley, the subject of the philosopher’s stone came up, and he remarked, “Iknow what the philosopher’s stone is; it’s sitting in that jar right there onthe bookshelf.” At least to us, this substance was mysterious, magical, and notto be taken lightly.My first taste of DMT wasn’t in Berkeley. Rather, I heeded Terence’s advice toget my psychedelic feet wet first before taking the plunge. I brought some homewith me, and on one of our visits to Hubbard Creek we “bioassayed” it for thefirst time. It was everything he had promised, and more. On the second toke, Istruggled to hold in the foul-tasting smoke as I watched reality dissolve beforemy eyes into a billion scintillating fractal jewels, all transforming andsquirming before my eyes like iridescent jellyfish while a buzzing, burbling,ripping sound like cellophane being torn to shreds echoed through my auralspace; there was a feeling of literally tearing loose, accelerating, fallingforward, faster and faster into a twisting, writhing tube or tunnel lined withglistening jewels, a supersonic roller coaster careening through the intestinesof God. The term “trip” is a cliché for the psychedelic experience, but in thecase of DMT it was very apt. There was definitely a feeling of movement, and ofcrossing a threshold of some kind, of briefly poking one’s head into a paralleldimension where the most astonishing things imaginable were going on, all in afrenetic, circus-like atmosphere of hilarious ecstasy. It’s almost as if thisdimension is always there, just a toke away, and these things, these entities,are bouncing around and cheering, “So happy to see you, so happy to meet you,meat-worm, welcome to our world, won’t you join the fun?” It was the ultimatecarnival ride: climb aboard and away we’ll go! Richard described it as being setadrift on a jeweled raft on an ocean of electricity. I thought this was anotherbeautiful description, just as accurate but different. As my explorationscontinued, that became an axiom. All the trips were different: different ondifferent occasions, but also different for different people. And yet all hadsimilarities.The problem with DMT, and part of its challenge, is that the experience isinherently ineffable; it cannot be described in ordinary language, it istranslinguistic. You come down, slam back into your body, out of breath,suffused with ecstasy, babbling, sobbing. And yet we are linguistic creatures,and there is a nearly irresistible impulse to try to describe it. This beginsalmost immediately following the trip, as if verbalization were a protectivereflex. DMT is more than the mind can handle; it’s overwhelming in its rawnakedness; we feel compelled to try to stuff it back into some kind oflinguistic box, and yet to do so is to diminish it. All of the descriptions,even Terence’s, as elegant as they are, fall short of the actual experience.This is part of the mystery of DMT. It is a phenomenon that can be repeatedlyexperienced, and yet it is as astonishing the hundredth time as it was thefirst, and something that strange is worthy of our attention. Certainly wethought so then, we thought so at La Chorrera, and I still think so.Nevertheless, I feel compelled to qualify what I’ve just declared, in light ofmore recent experiences. While going through an old trunk, I stumbled across ajournal from that year, 1967. Amid a mishmash of teenage musings, bad poetry,and expressions of longing for this or that girl, I came upon my account of thatfirst experience with DMT, which if nothing else illustrates how transformativeit was: > Only fragmented and elusive shards of the universe that I visited remain> within the grasp of my memory. That is in part what is so baffling about the> entire experience: I know that it was the most bizarre thing that ever> happened to me, that the reality that I encountered is so totally divorced> from normal reality that when my mind reintegrated itself into space-time, it> was completely incapable of comprehending, hence of remembering, what it had> been through. What is left are only two-dimensional metaphors and shallow> dialectical pictures. Even these slip from my consciousness as I attempt,> through the use of the inadequate tool of language, to derive some coherence> from the half-recollected visions. These were of a bizarre and otherworldly> beauty, so alien and yet so beautiful. The human mind cannot endure that much> beauty, and that kind of beauty, without losing its conception of what reality> is.> I have tried, unsuccessfully, to analyze this other reality and fit it into> some kind of linguistic description; what I have here set down is the closest> I have been able to come. It is extremely unsatisfactory, incomplete, perhaps> nonsensical. During the time that I was out, I was unable to speak. My vocal> apparatus, had it wanted to, would have been able to form the sound of a> habitual expression; but my mind, or the part of it that normally forms> articulate thoughts to be embodied in speech, could not function. Though I> could not myself speak, I heard, felt, saw, listened to, perhaps communicated> with, a sound that was not a sound, a voice that was more than a voice. I> encountered other creatures whose environment was this alien universe that I> had broken through to.

I know that after this I am going to strive to be a better> person; I am going to try to express the beautiful and concentrate less on the> hideous. I am going to see more of [my friend] Dea and try to learn some> lessons from her, because I believe that she is good. I am going to try to do> good. And here’s an additional passage written some weeks later: > Once again, tomorrow at the rising of the sun, I will do dimethyltryptamine. I> have done it too often in recent days, but I regret none of the times; I have> profited by each one. I look forward to tomorrow. It will be my last journey> for a while to that universe, this time with a girl I could love.

As long as one can experience and express (and to> experience is to express) the beautiful, then he is saved from madness, he is> saved from damnation. I have tried to look at life more positively, I have> tried to be more aware of beauty; I have enjoyed the world more and hated> myself less. That I was an insufferable romantic at sixteen is certainly clear, but at leastI was leaning in the right direction. That experience was therapeutic in manyways. It certainly marked a transition in my life, a pivotal turning pointtoward the rainforest and beyond. After this (apparent) evidence of theexistence of a parallel universe inhabited by non-human, intelligent entities,it was a little hard to go back to the routines of daily life.When I began writing this book in the summer of 2011, it had been more thanfifteen years since I’d inhaled a hit of DMT. In fact, that occasion, in a hotelroom in Rio de Janeiro, involved not DMT per se but its close analog,5-methoxy-DMT. Some have said that substance is even more bizarre andtransformative than DMT, if that’s possible. Since then, I’ve had otherencounters with DMT but always in the orally activated form found in ayahuasca.There are definite similarities between DMT and ayahuasca; but those familiarwith both states will confirm that they are not identical.In any case, when a chance arose recently to try some highly purified DMT, I didso, feeling that a return to that “place” was integral to my research. I smokedthe DMT on the same evening I’d taken a strong dose of ayahuasca. Thatexperience had ended hours earlier, but I must have still been in a state ofextreme MAO inhibition, because it only took one deep breath to plunge me intothe abyss of a full-on DMT flash. It was not what I had expected, or remembered.All the elements were there: the frozen feeling bubbling up and permeating mybody like quantum foam fizzing up to engulf the fragmenting mind, the feeling ofacceleration, my dissolving self urging me to let go, to surrender, as I wassucked into the visionary maelstrom. But there were no entities there this time;no joyous shouts of “hooray” by welcoming, self-transforming, elfin Fabergé eggsas Terence described them to the delight of so many. It was like visiting abrightly lit but abandoned amusement park; the music is playing and all therides whirl and gyrate and glitter, but there is no one there, no laughter ofhappy children to add joy and merriment. It was startling to me, and a littlesad, how cold and sterile it seemed.The experience was no less amazing than it used to be, perhaps, but far moreaustere. Reality is a hallucination generated by the brain to help us make senseof our being; it is made of fragments of memory, associations, ideas, people youremember, dreams you’ve had, things you’ve read and seen, all of which issomehow blended and extruded into something resembling a coherent consciousnarrative, the hallucination that we call “experience.” Dimethyltryptamine ripsback that curtain to show the raw data before it has been processed andmassaged. There is no comforting fiction of coherent consciousness; oneconfronts the mindless hammering of frenzied neurochemistry.Is this the difference between the DMT dimension visited by a lusty, romantickid of sixteen and the jaded man of sixty-one? I honestly can’t say. I don’tfeel that all joy and meaning has fled from my life. I still take ayahuascaregularly and am grateful for the lessons she imparts. But I may never againvisit that amusement park of the mind. It is a place for romantics, a place youtake your girl on a first date, and I am romantic no longer. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 21 - The Stoners’ Revenge With the summer of love fading into a fall of discontent and our rebel bandgrowing more alienated from our parents and peers, Terence left to travel theworld with his girlfriend. After finishing the Tussman program, he’d decided todrop out of school, which outwardly at least upset our parents. On a deeperlevel, however, our father’s response was probably more complicated. To beginwith, he’d paid a lot to support Terence and gotten little gratitude for thesacrifice. He also considered Berkeley to be the epicenter of the degeneracythat was sweeping the younger generation, which it was. Despite the inevitablelecture about Terence needing to complete his education, I think Dad felt somerelief when Terence departed with Elaine on the first of his global jaunts.Terence had worked all summer mounting butterfly specimens at the CaliforniaAcademy of Sciences and had saved enough money to hit the hippie trail, as manyothers were, bound for India, Nepal, and Jerusalem in search of adventure, goodhash, and spiritual fulfillment. Terence, burning with revolutionary fervor andwild ideas, had a book he intended to write before he returned. The work wasdestined to be the kind of polemical screed a guy writes when he’s twenty, knowseverything, and has bones to pick with everyone; it remains unpublished.Elaine and Terence were still tight when they set off. After a few months inEurope, they ended up in Jerusalem as planned, but something must have happenedalong the way, because they soon parted. Elaine joined a kibbutz and remained inIsrael. Terence, bereft, continued his wanderings through North Africa toMombasa, Kenya where he caught a tramp freighter bound for Seychelles, a tinyarchipelago in the Indian Ocean a thousand miles east. He rented a place onSilhouette Island a dozen miles off the main island of Mahé. Terence had donehis homework before leaving and had identified Seychelles, then a British colonyabout to become a commonwealth republic, as just about the closest thing toparadise left on the planet. The plan had been to live there in tropical blisswith Elaine while he wrote his book. He arrived with a broken heart and a supplyof cannabis seeds he’d brought with him from California; he immediately plantedthem in the garden behind his tiny house. His plan was to lay off smoking untilhis book was done. By then the cannabis would be ready to harvest, and he’d reapthe rewards born of his patience and discipline. With the seeds in the ground,he started to write.Back home, life went on as routinely as life can be when one is a restless andrebellious teenager, alienated, brooding, and caught up in the spirit ofgenerational revolution. My closest friends all felt it as well, perhaps evenmore acutely than other kids because of our isolation as social outcasts. As thetown’s first hippies, we were regarded with suspicion. It didn’t really matterto us; it only reinforced our sense of being special, cut from a different andbetter cloth than that of our classmates. We had each other, our music, and ourdope, and we hung out together as much as we could. We were the only stoners intown; all the others were “alkies,” and that only added to our smug sense ofsuperiority. While they were busy getting shit-faced in the gravel pit mostweekends, we pursued what we viewed as a better way.During the week, our little band would often head for my house, haul guitars andalbums and pipes and snacks out of the car and sequester ourselves in mybedroom, toke up and spend hours hanging, talking, playing guitars, andlistening to music. We’d have amazing conversations, thanks to the fluid thoughtprocesses triggered by the cannabis, and we always seemed to end up with atleast one key concept or insight. I don’t remember whether my mother was thereduring these sessions and simply too intimidated to object, or whether wearranged them to coincide with her absences. It wasn’t a particularly terriblething to do; in fact it was a lot less risky and destructive than a lot ofteenage behavior at the time.One group of jocks included kids from some of the “best” families in town. Theydisdained us as dirty hippies. It was the typical polarity between hippies andrednecks that was playing out in small towns across America. They were infamousin the town as “wild kids,” much more publicly obnoxious and confrontationalthan we were. Their main weekend recreation was to go out somewhere in theirfancy cars for bouts of binge drinking. One weekend they all got plastered anddrove a convertible down the twisty road between Somerset and Paonia at 120miles per hour until the car skidded down an embankment and landed,miraculously, right side up in the Gunnison River. The car was totaled, but noone was hurt. I dare say getting wasted in my bedroom was much safer. Our beliefwas that no one knew of our proclivities or newly adopted vices, but some of ourpeers were on to us, as we soon discovered.During that fall, a new variable entered my life, in the form of a new friend.Dea grew up on the Western Slope, but she had been living with a dealer in theHaight, a pretty tough guy, I gathered, who was also involved with a motorcyclegang. It was Tom who first encountered her, I don’t know where. It turned outshe was a “recovering nymphomaniac,” in her words; she’d returned from the crazyscene in San Francisco to try to get her life back together. Dea, a brown-eyed,longhaired, slender girl a couple of years older than I was, wore knee-highleather boots, beads, bangles, and enticingly sheer blouses. I was immediatelysmitten with her, but I told myself that if I treated her well our platonic tieswould naturally evolve toward physical affection.That never happened, but I still enjoyed hanging out with her. She had a vanwe’d take on day trips to Hayes Creek Falls or other sites along the CrystalRiver. We’d sit in the back of the van and get thoroughly baked and then goclimbing on the cliffs above the waterfall, giving me a chance to admire herslender grace. We kissed occasionally, and she seemed to enjoy it, but sherefused to go beyond that, insisting her past behavior had been a moral failingshe had to overcome. Instead, Dea became a kind of muse for me. I wrote poetryand haiku about her; I dreamed of her. She disappeared suddenly from my sceneafter a series of unfortunate events. For one thing, my father hated her, hippiethat she was, and the fact she was older made her a threat to me in his eyes.After we’d drifted apart, she went back to her former lover in San Francisco, orso I was told. I never heard from her again. She was a fragile figure in manyways, destined, I feared, to break in the course of life; I hope I was wrong.It wasn’t too long into the fall semester of my junior year that our tiny stonerband met its inevitable and humiliating end. I mentioned that we often gatheredin my bedroom after school; I’d break out the hash and we’d pass the pipe andhave a good time getting quietly baked. My first inkling that security had beenbreached was when a classmate who lived across the street asked me one day, in asnarky way, “Can I have a drag off’n that there opium pipe a yers, McKinney?”Believe it or not, that’s how people talked in Paonia in those days. I barelyknew the guy, and his question wasn’t welcomed. He and his pals must have beeneavesdropping underneath my bedroom window. Though I never knew for sure, Iassumed he was the one who informed on our sweet scene and brought us down, anevent that branded me as a figure just short of the Antichrist and brought ourpsychonautic adventures to a temporary end.On the morning of the day it happened, I had gotten up early and driven to theairport outside of town to meet Dea. Our plan was to smoke DMT together whileparked at the end of the runway and watch the sunrise. This we did, withoutincident. It was just the start of another ordinary school day except that wehad gotten together to breach the cosmic portals for a few minutes before the8:30 bell. Afterward, I said goodbye to her and arrived in class stillshimmering from my teleportation and probably reeking of DMT. The day passeduneventfully until the fourth period, when I was in my advanced English class,taught by a teacher, and a good one, we cruelly called “Large Marge.” Thing is,she really wasn’t large at all. She was a good friend of my mother’s, whichdidn’t make what happened any easier. Most of my partners in crime were there aswell, though they were seniors and I was a junior. It was the last class of theafternoon.About midway through it, Large Marge singled out the six of us in our group andsent us to the office. When we got there, the school principal told us to getour collective asses downtown to the city hall, just a couple of blocks away,where all of our parents were waiting. Thank God my father was traveling thatweek and only my mother was there. Most of the other rebels weren’t so lucky.The jig was up. The sheriff and his deputy took turns lecturing us on what aterrible thing it was for us to be doing, and making sure that I was singled outas mastermind and ringleader. I was defiant; I tried to argue with them aboutthe merits of cannabis versus alcohol, but they were not there to be persuaded;they were there to shut us down, hard, which they did.The parental reactions ranged from extreme anger to stunned incomprehension.Gary’s parents were especially furious. They’d never liked me, and here wasincontrovertible proof that I had led their precious son astray. He wasforbidden on the spot to ever see or associate with me again, a ban thatactually held up through most of the year. After that session, all my friendssheepishly filed out, accompanied by their parents. I was not let off solightly. They kept me behind, and gave me a stern lecture, calling me lucky notto be headed for jail. I was sobered and subdued by that time. I realized thatthey were right. They said that they knew I had supplied the drugs, and that Ihad the drugs, and that what I needed to do was to go with them back to my houseand give them my stash; if I did that, they would overlook this offense, fornow. They pressed me on where I had obtained the dope, suggesting that a certainfigure from town then living in Aspen had been my source, which I denied,because he hadn’t.We went back to the house, and I pulled out a dresser drawer behind which I hadsequestered a lovely, silk-lined box I’d purchased with my pipe in Chinatownthat summer. The box held my cannabis, the hash, several tabs of acid andmescaline, and the DMT. They took it all. The search wasn’t too thorough; theydidn’t even check behind the dresser drawer to make sure they had gotteneverything, and in fact they hadn’t. They’d missed the bottles of brucine andyohimbine (both reputed aphrodisiacs) that I’d ordered from Sigma (anyone couldin those days) as well as a bottle of adrenalin. I had an “experiment” underway,an effort to produce adrenochrome, a purported hallucinogen, by irradiating asolution of adrenalin with ultraviolet light. A black light I’d bought to put aglow on my psychedelic posters now illuminated a flask of adrenalin on the shelfabove my bed. Perhaps distracted by the wild posters themselves, they didn’teven notice that purple solution. After they left I flushed it down the toilet,which was probably just as well.The following months were tense for our tattered band. We weren’t hailed asfearless warriors of the new psychedelic revolution, not by a long shot. We weremore isolated than ever, shunned as the school’s untouchables for the rest ofthe year. We were defiant, of course, and for the most part, stuck together moretightly than ever. It wasn’t long after the bust that some of us started smokingpipes and cigarettes. It became our custom to spend our lunch hours sitting onthe hood and fenders of Tom’s Plymouth, parked in the lot across the street inplain sight of the school, and enjoy a good long smoke.This drove the principal crazy, but we weren’t on school property, and tobaccowasn’t restricted in those days. Our smoking was both perfectly legal and adefiant political statement. It’s ironic, really. Pipe smoking became a habitthat I’ve only been able to give up in the last couple of years. Of the variousdrugs I’ve taken over the years, pipe smoking was probably the most harmful, andalso one of the most pleasurable. Such is life. Tobacco was not particularlyaddictive for me; it was easy to quit when I finally made the decision to do so.The fact is, I enjoyed it, and that is why I had persisted in using it.The principal disliked us, and the feeling was mutual. I recall a coincidencethat has stayed with me for being so odd. I was in the library one day underearphones listening to “Ballad of a Thin Man,” Bob Dylan’s portrait of theclueless square, on the school’s cassette recorder. By then its refrain hadalready become the hip world’s view of the straight world reduced to a fewwords: “Because something is happening here / But you don’t know what it is / Doyou, Mister Jones?” In the last verse, the thin man walks into a room, eyes inhis pocket and “nose on the ground,” as the balladeer concludes, “There ought tobe a law / Against you comin’ around / You should be made / To wear earphones.”And that’s what happened. Just as the song neared this point, the principalstepped into the library, walked toward me, and picked up an extra set ofearphones just in time to hear Dylan’s last verse for himself. The timing wasperfect. It was too perfect! I looked up at him and smiled. Not a word passedbetween us. He took off the earphones and left. A defining event that school year turned out to be my encounters with a newEnglish teacher. Mack Faith had actually been teaching junior and senior Englishfor a year, but as a sophomore I had not been in his classes. Mack was a recentgraduate of the education program at Western State College in Gunnison. Heturned out to be a fellow subversive and befriended our alienated group. He andhis wife Diana made a charming couple, but like so many faculty who came andwent from the local high school over the years, they never quite fit in.New faculty members were not always welcomed with open arms by their peers. Mostteachers had been hired because they could coach a sport, not for theirclassroom skills. Mack, an intellectual, was different; he loved to teach andwas damn good at it. He and his wife were what would be called “liberal” today,often with a sneering tone. They believed in a lot of subversive things, likeracial equality and social justice.The town’s xenophobic warning systems marked them immediately as radicals,subversives, effete intellectuals, and “not like us.” They were outcasts, and sowas our little group of proto-hippies; naturally, we were drawn to each other.They welcomed us into their home on many occasions, where we would do prettymuch what we did when we got together on our own, sans the dope. Mack wasn’t ahippie, or at least didn’t look like one, and he never got loaded with us. Werespected his decision, knowing he respected ours and never pressed him orbrought dope to his house. He became a friend and a mentor to us for most ofthat year. I think he was still close enough to us in age that he couldempathize with many of our concerns. We were all preoccupied with civil rightsand the Vietnam War, strongly in favor of the former and vehemently opposed tothe latter. The conversations we had with them in the living room of their tiny,rented house served to heighten and focus our political consciousness.Besides teaching English, Mack was the drama and debate coach. Being nerdy,non-athletic types who fancied ourselves intellectuals, we were drawn to thoseactivities, and he encouraged us. The meatheads and jocks were not particularlyinterested in such things, so it was a chance for us to shine. Our debate anddrama practices became rich opportunities to hang out together and share timewith this wonderful man. He seemed to believe that maybe we actually had thingsworth doing, worth saying, worth thinking. We presented George Orwell’s NineteenEighty-Four as that year’s junior-senior class play. I had the leading role ofWinston Smith, while my buddy Phil played O’Brien, Smith’s betrayer andultimately his inquisitor. The story provocatively highlighted the hypocrisy ofthe times, and we flung ourselves into it with enthusiasm.Later that spring, we put together a one-act adaptation of George Bernard Shaw’sArms and the Man and entered it into the state drama competition in Denver. Thisproved to be the stoners’ revenge. When we performed the play we were loaded—oncannabis, mostly, though some of us may have been on stronger stuff. We totallyswept the board: best actor, best play, best adaptation, best everything. Mackwas pleased; the rest of us were stunned and ecstatic. We were a Podunk highschool from the Western Slope going up against the best drama departments inColorado, and we had totally triumphed. I think the faculty and a lot of othersat the school didn’t know what to say. We were supposed to be the degenerate,dirty, rotten, hippies and we’d brought glory and recognition to our school. Wewere congratulated—grudgingly—by the principal during a school assembly at theend of the semester. Knowing what he really thought of us, I’m sure that stuckin his craw.I remember Mack with fondness. He was my first real mentor-teacher. I have beenblessed to have others since then, but Mack was the first. He believed in me, inus, when no one else did. I will always love him for that. Not only was he amentor, he taught me, by example, the importance of that role. I have been ateacher myself now for over a decade, and I try to be a mentor and encourage mystudents to believe in themselves, to think for themselves, and to not letanyone stop them from doing what they need to do. Some of them have taken thatto heart, and I have been proud to see them go forth to pursue careers and lifepaths that are way beyond anything I could ever accomplish. It’s satisfying toknow you have made a difference to a bright mind. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 22 - My Datura Misadventure Following the bust, our oppressors underestimated our ingenuity and commitmentto continuing our explorations. Soon thereafter, my fellow adventurer Richardand I were severely poisoned, thanks to my lack of botanical expertise at thetime. According to the mainstream media, a craze had been sweeping the country:young people were flocking to their local garden-supply shops to buy morningglory seeds, which had been reported to contain LSD-like compounds. In fact,this is true of certain species. There’s evidence that some species of Ipomoeaand Rivea were used as ritual intoxicants by the Aztecs and other Mesoamericangroups, and were known in the Nahuatl language as ololiuqui, meaning “roundthing,” in reference to the seeds. I had known about that for some time, and hadtried Ipomoea seeds a few months earlier. The dose must have been either toosmall or insufficiently digested, because I never got anywhere besides a mildnausea after bolting down 300 or so seeds of the Heavenly Blue variety.But, being the intrepid and reckless psychonaut that I was, I was ready to giveit another go. After all, there were very few other options, after the bust, andI thought I knew more than I did. (I have since compensated for that in my oldage by realizing that I know very little about anything.) There was an oddfellow living in Paonia at the time, a harmless gentleman who worked in thelocal haberdashery. He was also floridly gay, so naturally he was ostracized,vilified, mocked in the ways that were accepted and yet so needlessly cruel inthose days. He lived by himself in a tiny one-room building behind the clothingstore, and the yard of this humble dwelling was a weedy lot. Among the weedsgrowing there was a beautiful, robust plant that had a strong odor and put outenormous white flowers. Fancying that I was a far better botanist than was thecase, I determined it to be a moonflower plant, a morning glory species nowknown as Ipomoea alba, which indeed does have enormous, lovely white flowers.And so I thought that its seeds might be a good source of the lysergic acidalkaloids reported in related species. Richard, Phil, and I decided it wasworthy of a LAB, that is, a large animal bioassay. So we waited until after darkone night, snuck into George’s yard, collected several of the unripe, juicy,spiky seedpods, and went off somewhere to bolt them down.Those with a modicum of botanical expertise have by now recognized my dangerousmistake. The plant we collected is sometimes referred to as moonflower and doeshave large white flowers. It is more often called jimson weed, however, a nameapplied to several species of Datura, a toxic member of the deadly nightshadefamily. What we’d gotten our hands on was Datura metel, which is highlypsychoactive but not psychedelic. It contains the toxic tropane alkaloidsatropine, hyoscyamine, scopolamine, and related minor alkaloids. They are potentanticholinergics, meaning that they block the action of the neurotransmitteracetylcholine. At high doses they can be fatal, but at the lower doses we(thankfully) had ingested, it induces a state of profound delirium andconfusion. One usually has little recall of the experience, because it alsowipes out short-term memory.In my lectures these days, I tell my students that Datura is a true hallucinogenbut not a psychedelic, whereas psychedelics like psilocybin are truepsychedelics but not hallucinogens. I make the distinction on pharmacologicaland phenomenological grounds. True psychedelics are serotonin or 5-HT2A agonists(serotonin is also called 5-hydroxytryptamine, commonly abbreviated to 5-HT).This means that they activate a particular population of 5-HT receptors in thebrain, namely, the 5-HT2A receptor subtypes. True psychedelics like LSD, DMT,psilocybin, and mescaline all have in common that they are 5-HT2A agonists. Theyinduce profound visual distortions and hypnagogic images behind the eyelids butrarely induce true hallucinations, which psychologists define as seeingsomething that is not there but that one is unable to tell is not there. Onpsychedelics, one may see things that are not there but generally knows thesethings are not “real.”The tropane alkaloids from Datura and other nightshades act quite differently.They are antagonists—that is, they block the action of the neurotransmitteracetylcholine at a subtype of receptors called muscarinic acetylcholinereceptors. And the experience they elicit is quite different than the typicalpsychedelic experience. They don’t cause pretty patterns behind the eyelids, nordo they induce the feelings of ecstasy and oceanic boundlessness that is atypical aspect of the mystical, transcendent states that make psychedelics sointeresting. But they do induce true hallucinations, meaning that one seesthings that appear to be real but aren’t. And there is no way to tell, at leastnot in the resulting state of delirium and confusion.The dose we’d taken was more than enough to manifest the full spectrum oftropane alkaloid poisoning for the next thirty-six hours. We suddenly got acrash course in datura consciousness, although I was trying to fit it into thecontext of a bad acid trip, based on my assumption that we’d eaten morning gloryseeds. I had only taken acid once or twice previously, so as far as I knew, thiswas the “bad trip” that the supposed experts were trying to scare everyone with.A few weeks later I found a picture of the very plant that grew in thehaberdasher’s garden, and it was Datura metel. Then it all made sense. What we’dsurvived was not an atypical acid trip, but a textbook example of acute tropaneintoxication.The experience was horrific in many respects, and my recollections arefragmentary, given that the drug itself partially blocks short-term memory. Fromwhat little I do recall, I can say that the seeds began to act very quicklyafter we’d eaten them, and things got weird.After the three of us had collected the seeds, we returned to my home andreclined in my room. Phil, who had to drive home, had decided not to ingest, butRichard and I had done so. It took about twenty minutes for an overwhelmingeffect to manifest, and by the time I got up to see Richard and Phil out thedoor the effects were already out of control. Mom was sleeping, and in myconfusion I lost my way and stumbled into her bedroom. She was appalled; shecould see something was wrong but couldn’t tell what. She became very alarmed,almost hysterical. I thought she was going insane, but just the opposite wastrue. I brushed past her, muttering something like “It’ll be OK,” and barricadedmyself in my room. I was panicked but I just wanted to sit down, and try to getmy center.An effect of the tropane alkaloids is that they induce mydriasis, that is, theymarkedly dilate the eyes. As a result, you can’t focus on anything; vision isblurry, and if you look at mottled surfaces, anything with texture, they’llappear to be moving or squirming. The tropane-impaired vision, accompanied bytropane-impaired cognitive and interpretive functions, construct a hallucinatoryrepresentation of reality that may or may not correspond to consensus reality.Which explains why I saw bugs! In my delirious and visually impaired state,every surface in the room appeared to be swarming with insects. I was quitedistraught. Finally the situation reached a crescendo when, somehow, kind of outof nowhere, emerged what I saw as the Chief Bug, or the seed source of all thesebugs. I have no idea what the actual object was; I think it may have been apiece of charred paper or something like that. But I determined that the ChiefBug must be expelled; and so with great fear and loathing, I caught the evilthing up and burst out of the room, ran to the trash can in the alley behind thehouse, and disposed of it. Then I ran back to my room and barricaded myself inagain.This is what I remember happening. I think it happened, but maybe it is acomplete fabrication or false memory. All this time, while the drama with thebugs was unfolding in my bedroom, people would appear to me, wraithlike, at thefoot of the bed. They were mostly my friends, or at least I thought they were. Iwould plead for help, crying out, help me, help me! And they would just lookpitying, and slowly fade away. These prolonged apparitions are completelytypical of the tropane experience. Certain Datura species and the closelyrelated Brugmansia species are used extensively in witchcraft in South America.(The Brugmansia species were formerly classified as belonging to the Daturagenus and are sometimes called “tree daturas.”) The plants are widely used forbrujería both in European witchcraft and in indigenous practices. This is partlya result of the fact that they are power plants, that is, they can be used torender a person helpless as a result of the confusion and disorientation theycan produce. Their ability to evoke an unseen world populated by disembodied orwraithlike spirits may form the basis for such belief systems in both theWestern and indigenous traditions.After I had succeeded in expelling the Chief Bug from my room, things settleddown a bit. The experience was far from over but at least my panic had subsided.I eventually fell into a troubled and dream-wracked sleep, although sleep is amisnomer because the state of datura intoxication is much like being in a dream,or more accurately, a nightmare. Sometime the next morning the effects werediminished enough that I could emerge from my room and talk to my mother. We hada more or less coherent conversation about what had happened. My vision hadimproved; I was no longer hallucinating bugs, but wraiths were still showing upat the peripheries of vision, and this persisted for hours.Later that day, we went over to Richard’s house and talked to his mother.Richard’s experience had also been long and horrific. Like me, he was far fromrecovered; our symptoms persisted even eighteen hours after ingestion. While wewere sitting at the kitchen table in Richard’s house, the air suddenly filledwith a brown fog, and large pieces of hash began to materialize out of the air!Only Richard and I could see it, of course, but despite our best efforts, it wasnot possible to lay our hands on any and smoke it! This was the firstmanifestation of what came to be known as the Good Shit. It also figuredprominently in the aftermath of the experiment at La Chorrera some four years inthe future, when I conjured hash out of the air with my guitar, while performingwith my band, the Good Shit. Of course I had neither guitar nor band, nor GoodShit for that matter, but during my delusions at the time I believed I had both.The misadventure marked the end of our explorations for a while. My father wasfurious when he returned and heard about it. By then, I think, he was ready towash his hands of me. He asked me if I’d learned my lesson, if I’d ever do thatagain. I said yes, I would, because I saw it as important to confront one’sfears. (Remember, I thought I’d survived a bad acid trip.) After that answer, hesaid that I had to be demented, and perhaps I was.Within a few weeks, reports of our datura encounter had spread through ourcircle, inexplicably compelling a couple of girls to try it themselves. Aftercollecting seeds from the haberdasher’s plant, they bolted them down at thelocal pool hall and caused a minor scandal when they took off their clothes andran into the street. Though I was not present, I was, naturally enough, blamedfor it as the pied piper who had led these innocents astray.Shortly after that, the bush with the big white flowers disappeared. I believethe local sheriff decided it had to be eradicated, and he was probably right.I’ve noted this already, but it’s worth repeating: datura should not be takenlightly. In fact, I don’t recommend it under any circumstances. The Brugmansiaspecies, the tree daturas, are extensively used in South American shamanism, andthe leaves are occasionally used as an admixture in ayahuasca. I’ve hadayahuasca laced with toé (the traditional name for Brugmansia) and it doesn’tenhance the experience. One can often tell the additive is present in theayahuasca brew because the tropanes cause a “dry mouth” effect, inducing apersistent, severe thirst, which is part of their anticholinergic effect. If youshould ingest ayahuasca that induces this effect, there is a good chance itcontains toé as an admixture; and that, in turn, is a good sign that you aredealing with a brujo, a witch, and a person of dubious character. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 23 - Escape from Mordor: 1968 Following the drama festival, the final semester of my junior year rapidly drewto a close. Most of my close friends graduated that spring and began scatteringto their various destinies. Richard went off to Aspen and found a cooking job, amove that defined his later career as a highly regarded chef. Tom, who hadworked off and on as a carpenter throughout high school, headed for Denver tohelp out his brother’s construction company. Gary had recently met and becomeengaged to his first wife. Shortly after graduation, the couple resettled inBoulder where Gary began his studies at the University of Colorado. Of theoriginal group, only Madeline, Phil, and I were still stuck in Paonia.The prospect of returning to school after we’d been ostracized seemed quitebleak. Since Terence had been allowed to complete his final two years of highschool in California, it seemed only fair that I should be allowed to gosomewhere else for my last year. Determined to escape, I hatched a plan I beganto implement shortly after the semester ended.Crossing the mountain to the Crystal River Valley, I got a summer job as adishwasher at the Redstone Inn, just up the road from my aunt and uncle’s ranch.The inn had been built by John Cleveland Osgood, a coal baron who created amining and steelmaking empire in the area in the late nineteenth century. Osgoodand his second wife, a Swedish countess, lived in a lavish, Tudor-style mansionhalf a mile up a private road from his inn. That forty-two room house wasofficially known as Cleveholm Manor, but we called it the Redstone Castle.Osgood, one of the top industrialists of his day, designed Redstone as a companytown complete with a theater, library, bathhouse, clubhouse, and school. Inaddition to eighty-four chalet-style cottages built to house the married minersand their families, there was the inn, which originally served as lodging forsingle miners. The Redstone became a high-end inn in 1925 after Osgood lost themine in a bitter stock dispute, and with minor interruptions (and through manyowners) it has operated as a resort ever since.Kids from Paonia and other nearby towns often got summer jobs in resort townssuch as Aspen, Glenwood Springs, and Redstone. The winter ski season was busier,but there was enough summer tourist traffic to make it relatively easy to findwork. I was soon ensconced in a dormer room in the Redstone Inn with the othersummer slaves. As long as I showed up to wash dishes for the dinner shift eachevening, I was free to ramble the surrounding hills. Though my stay was shortand uneventful, it was a novel situation for being the first time I’d lived onmy own.I somehow obtained a tab of acid and took it alone one beautiful moonlit night.I felt it was important that I should take it alone, and at night—partly, Ithink, because I wanted to confront the fears triggered by my misadventure withdatura. My third LSD trip went off without a hitch. It was a beautifulexperience. I spent half of it wandering the nearby forests and trails, and halfalone in my room. The highlight was when I looked in the mirror. This is notsomething you want to do on LSD unless you’re prepared! I spent a long timelooking into my own eyes, studying my visage. After a few minutes of staring, Imet my totem animal: a lion! I was quite surprised but it was unmistakable. Eversince that night I have known and identified with the lion as my shamanic spiritguide. One could do worse.My three-week stint there ended when I moved on to the Aspen-Snowmass area andits developing hippie scene. It was not exactly the Haight, but it would do.There were drugs to be had, hippie chicks about, and loads of possibilities.Being just that much farther from Paonia was a definite plus, and so was havingRichard there as a friend. I quickly secured another dishwashing gig, this timeat Cyrano’s Restaurant in Snowmass Village, a fancy shrimp and steak house inthe center of the Snowmass Mall. The job included accommodations in thehalf-empty Pokolodi Lodge. This turned out to be a sweet deal. I had a job, Ihad lodging—little more than a hotel room but it would serve—and I had most ofmy meals provided by the restaurant. If you’re young and itinerant and don’tcare about making more than just enough to get by, I highly recommenddishwashing as a profession. There’s a need for this skill almost everywhere,and it’s a good way to secure employment as soon as you arrive in a new place.It worked for me in Redstone and Snowmass, and at various other times in theyears ahead. I was set for a great summer. In fact, it was destined to be oneking-hell crazy summer, to borrow a phrase from an Aspen local, Hunter Thompson.By this time, Tom, the carpenter, had relocated in Denver and connected withsome of the area’s recreational psychopharmacologists, an eclectic mix of verysmart, occasionally quite dysfunctional people. But they had access to gooddrugs, and wheels, so my little outpost in Snowmass became a weekend partydestination. Practically every weekend one or more of the Denver crowd wouldshow up, ready for some serious bioassays. There was a lovely little lake nearthe lodge, a short walk away. There was rarely anyone up there, so it became ourown private retreat, a place we’d go to trip on the psychedelic of the week,hunt mushrooms, and just hang out.Into this scene came Terence, fresh from his yearlong ramble through Asia andthe layover in Seychelles where he’d written his book. He had the manuscriptwith him, ready to pitch it to publishers in New York. As I mentioned, his ideahad been to plant his cannabis seeds and write until both the book and his crophad reached a finished state. According to a story Terence would later tell,when that day came he got totally baked and realized what he’d written wasterrible. He panicked, knowing he had to rewrite the entire thing, which he did,smoking day and night, extending his stay on Silhouette Island an extra monthwhile he bulled it through. He thought the result was much better; at least hewould not be embarrassed to show it around. Though I never saw the pre-cannabisversion, when I did finally get a chance to read the manuscript I found itinteresting but flawed, and Terence would have been the first to agree. Itsinteresting title suggested a McLuhanesque influence: Crypto-Rap:Meta-Electrical Speculations on Culture. It was the kind of book that anintense, angry young intellectual, fueled by psychedelics and radical politics,would write in the waning years of the 1960s. There was plenty of good materialin there, but it wasn’t going to cause a stir among publishers, as he laterdiscovered. The manuscript still exists. It might be of interest today forhistorical reasons more than as a work of cultural analysis. That said, itsurely holds clues to the evolution of Terence’s thought process and may yetfind its way into the light.Terence’s stopover in Snowmass was brief but rich. He had arrived back from Asiaon the West Coast and was on his way to New York to sell the book and perhaps topursue a new love interest. I know nothing about her beyond that she lived outEast and was one of the magnets drawing him to New York. During his travels inAsia, Terence had done a bit of hash smuggling, which in those days wasrelatively easy. Before the War on Drugs started, a lot of itinerants were ableto finance their nomadic lifestyles by sending a few ounces, or a few kilos, ofNepali temple balls or Afghani Red to the hash-starved folks back home. Sincehe’d be passing through Colorado, he’d decided to direct one of his shipments toPaonia, addressing it to himself at our post office box so he could pick it up.Needing a respite from Snowmass, we decided to spend a few days in Paonia. Dadflew over in his plane and brought us home. Terence was agitated and insisted onchecking the mail every day. He said this was his biggest shipment yet. When itfinally arrived, we knew it immediately, because the entire post office wasredolent with the aroma of fine Nepali hash. Terence had had the bright idea toconceal the hash in the swollen stomach of one of those “happy Buddha”statuettes. The only problem was, the shippers had done a shoddy job of gluingthe thing together, and it had broken open in transit, scattering large balls ofhash throughout the packing material.Terence handled this with aplomb. When he stepped to the window to pick up thepackage, the postmaster asked if it contained perfume or something. Withoutmissing a beat, Terence replied, “Incense.” Our friendly local postmaster mighthave been a little skeptical at this explanation, but if so he didn’t let on. Weaccepted the package, which was elaborately sewn with a muslin covering, andhightailed it out of there. The good news was that we now had an abundance ofhash, including a small personal stash that made my remaining year of highschool quite tolerable.Shortly after that, Terence took off for New York, where he hoped to sell someTibetan thangkas he’d purchased in Kathmandu—“smelly, moth-eaten things,” ourfather called them—each worth several thousand dollars. Terence got a good pricefor them in New York among the Asian art dealers. His love interest apparentlyhadn’t panned out, and he only stayed there a few weeks. But his pockets werestuffed again. Everyone who could, it seemed, was hitting the hippie trail inIndia, Thailand, and Nepal. Terence wasted no time getting back on the road.Having discovered a taste for the nomadic lifestyle, and a way to fund it, hewas prepared to travel for the rest of his life. I wouldn’t see him again foralmost two years, just months before our mother’s death and our subsequent tripto Colombia. We corresponded, though at a leisurely pace that those who havegrown up with email can scarcely imagine. The richness and depth of ourexchanges more than made up for their infrequency. Though we didn’t really thinkof it in such terms at the time, we were hatching our plans to actualize theeschaton.August was fading; already an early autumn chill could be felt in the clearmountain mornings. Terence had left for the East Coast, book and thangkas intow, and I entered phase three in my plan to evade a return to Paonia for mysenior year. Over the summer at Snowmass, I’d become pretty good friends with myboss at the restaurant, whose name was Joe. Joe wasn’t that much older than Iwas, but he qualified as a kind of mentor. He understood why I dreaded goingback to Mordor, so he offered to sponsor me, which meant he’d become, if not myguardian, at least a responsible adult willing to look after me. With hissupport assured, I approached the principal at Aspen High School, who proved tobe open-minded about the experiment. It helped that I’d be turning eighteen in afew months, making me a legal adult. If Joe was willing to look after me,provide menial employment and a roof to stay under, the principal agreed to letme enroll.I sprang the surprise on my parents when they arrived to drive me home. Bothwere unhappy about it, especially my mother, who was probably upset at thethought of losing a second son after Terence had prematurely flown the coop forCalifornia. Given that precedent, I insisted that I ought to be allowed tofinish school somewhere else, somewhere less narrow-minded. Mom was alreadyquite concerned about her sons, given our interest in psychedelics. She couldn’timagine our explorations in that alien world could lead to anything good. Iremember one tearful conversation Terence and I had with her that summer. “Youboth have fine minds,” she said. “I am just so worried that you will lose themto a bunch of drugs.” We tried to reassure her that our interest was serious,and that our investigations might one day lead us to become great scientists.Ironically, her words were prophetic, though she wouldn’t live to see ourdeparture for La Chorrera and the psychological upset that awaited us there. Nordid she live to see that we were right, as well. Indeed, Terence and I wouldcontinue to explore our youthful fascinations, if along different paths. I mightnot have achieved greatness as a scientist, but I have earned a modestreputation investigating the very substances she so feared. It saddens me thatour passions were never more than a source of constant worry for her.On that day in Aspen when I told them I was staying, my father could see I wasdetermined. By arranging to be enrolled, employed, and sponsored by an adult, Ihad outmaneuvered him, leaving him without much to say. By then he was probablyso disgusted with me he might have been happy to let me go, but Mom wasn’t readyfor the nest to be so abruptly vacated. After intense discussion, we worked outa compromise. I would not complete my senior year at Aspen High, that hotbed ofdope and liberal ideas, nor would I return to classes in Paonia. Instead, mymother and I would rent an apartment in Grand Junction and I’d finish my studiesthere. We would stay at the apartment during the week while my father was on theroad and return to Paonia for the weekends.In many ways this arrangement worked out well. For one thing, the sheer size ofGrand Junction High School, with its more than 3,000 students, improved myprospects of meeting compatible friends. The school also offered many academicopportunities that weren’t available in Paonia, with its student body of 250. Asthe year wore on, this became the justification my parents often gave theirfriends when asked why I was attending a different school: I was a brilliantkid, they said, and I deserved some of the advantages that Terence had enjoyed.I heartily agreed. Though I returned to Paonia many times that year, and manytimes since, I would never again be its prisoner. I want to pause the narrative there, in 1968, and take a moment to acknowledgehow my feelings about Paonia have changed over the decades. I last visited myhometown in the fall of 2011 as a pilgrim doing research for this book. I wantedto reflect on family roots, on the ties that bind a life to a place and time. Iflew into Aspen and poked around there for a day, looking for the old hauntswhere I’d lived in summers past, but everything had changed. Like buildings inthe film Dark City, those in Aspen had morphed and re-morphed over the decades,some torn down, others thrown up, others renovated, many in that pseudo-Tyroleanstyle that tends to plague ski towns. While Aspen remains a theme park for theüber-wealthy, a plastic cocoon of tasteful but corporatized shops andrestaurants and galleries, the rest of Western Colorado is a different story.Like most everywhere else, circumstances have gotten harder there: foreclosures,unemployment, no health care, crumbling infrastructure, a sense of Americacollapsing into a sort of stunned Third-Worldism as the country realizes its dayin the sun is over.And yet, for all that, life was good on that warm and clear October afternoon,with the aspens in full color in the high country, the hills dripping withmolten yellows and oranges, aflame with the dying foliage giving up its soul ina carotenoid riot. The sky was brilliant blue with wispy clouds aloft and a lotof lenticular cloud formations—a good sign! I drove out of Aspen and headed forSnowmass Village, still more a bubble than Aspen will ever be, a plannedcommunity from the start. I knew Cyrano’s, the restaurant, had been gone fordecades, but I spent an hour wandering the mall, which was eerily empty in theoffseason; I felt I’d stepped into an old computer game like Myst. I stoppedwhere I was pretty sure the restaurant had been, but the surroundings were alldifferent. As for the little lake a short walk from the lodge where I’d stayedin 1968, perhaps that had been an artificial reservoir. I’m not sure, but alater search for it via Google Earth after my trip led me to think it might begone as well.Returning to the highway, Colorado 133, I passed through Carbondale with itslovely, redone main drag, lots of cobblestone, little shops, street sculpture,and even a medical cannabis dispensary—a hopeful development. Why shouldn’t thissimple and good medicine be available at your local apothecary, as it once was?There’s far too much handwringing about things like this that could be so simplysolved. I took the back way into Redstone, inching through town, watching outfor the kids, until I reached the Redstone Inn, as imposing and quaintlyout-of-date as ever with its towers and dormers, wraparound balconies andgingerbread banisters. In the plaza formed by its U-shaped driveway was achromed metal sculpture of a falconer, complete with falcon, seated on a chair.It was a cool sculpture, but I couldn’t decide if it fit there or not. Anychange from the past as I remembered it introduced a kind of cognitivedissonance. I ate in the inn that evening, but I stayed at Chair Mountain Ranch,always a bittersweet experience. It’s hard to be at a place that figured in somany family memories without feeling eight years old again. And yet there, too,much had changed. The lodge’s outward appearance was much as I recalled it, butthe old cabins were gone, replaced by a row of very nice two-bedroom cabinsacross from the new fishing pond—“new” meaning not there when I was a boy. Thecurrent proprietors are nice folks, but of course they can’t understand how, forme, the ranch is like a family heirloom that’s been sold off to someone with noconnections to its past.The next day I drove to Delta with my cousin Judy to visit my beloved Aunt Maymeon her ninety-seventh birthday. Medicaid paid for her to live in a nursing homein return for the lien on her house, this being the brutal way we provide forthe extremely old; finally, you lose everything, they take it all. But it’s agood place, clean and bright, and she was well cared for by the attentive staff.Though she could no longer see or hear well, and was out of it most of the time,behind her rheumy eyes her lively spirit and sense of humor were still there, Ifelt, but just not getting out. I thought she had a flash of recognition at thesight of me, but that may have been wishful thinking. Still and all, it was asomewhat depressing and sobering encounter, her grim plight a reminder of whatlies in store for many of us, that is, to live for years beyond the joy of beingalive. I made a mental note to remember to secure myself that tincture ofhemlock so it’s there when the time comes. I’d rather exit in style, under myown volition, or so I say now. We’ll see.We stayed an hour, sharing a little ice cream until lunch arrived and thenquietly slipped out. Though I knew I might not see her again, somehow my senseof loss was not as great as it had been in the past; so much of her was alreadygone. She died several months later.The rest of the day was considerably more upbeat. Judy and I stopped by the newPaonia Public Library, a beautiful facility paid for by donations from thecommunity, including the purchase of fifty-dollar bricks, which afforded me thetreat of standing in the lobby and reviewing the names etched on them, each oneevoking old memories, faces, teachers, families. My civically engaged cousin ison the library board and is the curator of the North Fork Historical SocietyMuseum, which we visited next. The place was full of artifacts left by thepeople who settled and built Paonia, some of them pictured in ancient, fadedphotos; I couldn’t imagine what was masked by the dour expressions on thoselong-dead faces. There was too much to process; old cameras, musicalinstruments, bygone baby clothes and adult fashions; an entire high schoolclassroom, complete with antique desks; an office, a child’s bedroom, anold-fashioned kitchen. I spotted a few familiar items, including mygrandfather’s old Remington typewriter, an uncle’s letter sweater, and the dollfurniture and a toy kitchen set that once belonged to Judy and her twin sister.I even recognized the embroidered sentiment that hung in Aunt Mayme’s kitchenfor decades: “Old friendships are like flowers in memory’s scented garden.” Theflowers are faded now, their scent reminiscent of the inside of my mother’spurse when I was a boy, a vague amalgam of cheap lavender cologne and makeup.Then Judy brought out the real treasures, stored in an old filing cabinet:nearly pristine copies of the Eyrie, the Paonia High School yearbook for 1968and ’69. Here were the photos of my former classmates, old friends and enemies,girls I’d pined for with their crazy upswept hairdos—innocent young women, nowaging like me. A few of my former schoolmates had departed the world by then,including my friend Tom, who died in 2011. The faces in those portraits had yetto be etched with the lines of character, of adversity confronted and overcome,or not. I was a junior that year, looking serious, and not too much a doofus inmy horn-rimmed glasses. What a shock it was to turn the page and see mylong-lost, long-lusted-for Rosalie—my God, that girl was beautiful! It wasstrange how just the name of someone I hadn’t thought of in years could activatelong-dormant neural traces, bringing back a person’s laugh or another’sgoofiness. That all of these people had grown up and lived their lives in someuniverse worlds apart from my own was almost impossible to get my head around.That evening I had dinner with an old friend from those days. A few years ago,he returned to the family fruit ranch to care for his aging father, who hadsince passed on. His father had sold off his arable land, and the former appleorchard had been bulldozed to make way for grapes—Paonia has quite a reputationthese days for its local wines. Without good cropland, my friend was stuck. Theestate had yet to be settled, and his siblings hadn’t settled on a plan formaking the homestead viable in the interim. He had considered building agreenhouse and growing medical cannabis, but the others vetoed the idea, and hisparents slowly stopped spinning in their graves.He looked good, as handsome as he was in high school, the lines in his face onlyadding to his character. He remained a committed Luddite, utterly convinced thatwe’ll wake up someday and find our smart machines have become our masters. Hehad no use for email or the Internet, which makes it hard for us to keep intouch, but we manage. I gently broke it to him that the takeover happened yearsago and that he may as well get with the program, but he wasn’t buying it.We had a fine meal that night at the Flying Fork, a relatively new restaurant intown. Paonia might have felt like a prison I had to break out of as a kid, butsharing the company of an old friend from those days, I was keenly aware howattached I remained to the land where I’d grown up. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 24 - The Church Lawn Bunch By the time my senior year had started in the fall of 1968, Mom and I had movedinto a modest apartment in Grand Junction, the lower floor of a duplex with alovely, glassed-in porch. It was perfect for two people, and a short walk frommy new school. The nine months Mom and I spent there were some of the best ofour lives. It was a chance for us to bond again, to get to know each other andheal some of the wounds that my bid for independence had inflicted. I was stilla crazy, scary teenager, but when Mom and I were together, without Dad in thepicture, we got along quite well. I was smoking hash every night in my bedroom,and I think Mom knew that, but she was OK with it, or at least she didn’t make ascene about it. Looking back, I am grateful that we had that time together.Neither of us could know, of course, that she had little more than two years tolive.I loved going to a “big city” high school, which it wasn’t, really, but it wasbiggest the institution I’d ever attended. It didn’t take me long to find mycohort. There were already a good number of aspiring hippies, stoners, rebels,and alienated intellectuals, and I gravitated to them naturally. The stigmatizedgroup at that school was known as the church lawn bunch, because we passed ourlunch hours smoking on the lawn of the First Congregational United Church ofChrist across the street. I soon met characters that would shape my experiencethere and beyond, as many of us were headed for the University of Colorado inBoulder after graduation.Among the most peculiar was a guy I’ll call Craze. In fact, Craze was one of theoddest people I’ve ever known. Like me, he was a new student that year, havingrecently arrived in town. He was also the son of a single mother, again like me,or so it appeared to others. Craze was a soft-spoken, very blond, bird-likefellow who parted his hair in the middle. He had a refined aesthetic sense,effeminate mannerisms, and a quavering voice. He may have been into acid, oreven on it most of the time, but frankly it was hard to tell. It wasn’t easyhaving a rational conversation with him under the best of circumstances. Aftergraduation Craze moved to Boulder, where during my freshman year our livesbecame more entangled than I could have wished, mainly because we were bothattracted to the same woman.And what a woman she was! I met Peggy shortly after I started school, and shewas to make me both miserable and ecstatic for nearly a decade. Peggy waspossibly the prettiest girl I had ever seen. A Nordic blonde, then seventeen,she had long hair so fair it was almost white; pale, translucent skin that wasflawlessly smooth; long legs, deep blue eyes, perfect breasts, and a face lovelyand entrancing to gaze upon. Peggy was so preternaturally gorgeous her beautycrossed over from the erotic into the angelic, and it almost seemed sacrilegiousto picture her indulging in an act as base as sex. I longed to be her lover inpart because I thought she was so pure. She needed someone like me—no, sheneeded me—to protect her from the depredations of the other barbarians who onlywanted to bring this angel to the ground.In reality, of course, there was plenty of lust in my feelings, but I was indenial about it. Peggy actually had a gentle personality as attractive as herappearance. And she was kind to me on those rare occasions when I overcame myshyness enough to stammer out a bit of small talk. We developed a tentativefriendship over that year. When both of us ended up in Boulder my obsessioncontinued, as it would off and on for years, evolving through various phases ofagony and exhilaration.At first there seemed little chance of pursuing a deeper relationship with her.She wasn’t a druggie or part of the church lawn crowd; she was too ethereal and“nice” for any of that. Another inconvenience was that my new friend Crazeshared my obsession and thus posed a threat. That Peggy would show any interestin a guy who was orders of magnitude weirder than I was made no sense. Nor didmy jealousy. Peggy was no more involved with Craze than she was with me. ButPeggy, being nice, was nice to everybody. She wasn’t really in the circuit ofdating and relationships at the time, as far as I was aware.Peggy and Craze are the two figures I remember most from those days, but therewere others. Clint, for instance, was an athlete and intellectual, an exemplarof those young men we all knew in school, the high-achievers who the rest of usslackers were encouraged to emulate. But Clint was a great guy. He saw throughall that and had a balanced perspective on life, and he liked to smoke hash,which is how he fell in with me. He was looked up to and widely admired, but hewasn’t full of himself. He ended up going to Stanford after graduation and livedin Berkeley for a while, so we stayed in touch long after we’d left GrandJunction behind.Dirk was another memorable figure. He had a nice car, good looks, and a halo ofgolden hair. He was one of those rare people who shouldn’t take psychedelics,ever, because they are too delicately balanced. He may have had a geneticpredisposition to psychosis or mania. After one too many acid trips, he fellinto a long-term psychosis that spring—some kind of schizophreniformdissociative state—and suffered the interventions of the mental healthestablishment. He was institutionalized for months. When I next saw him inBoulder he seemed fully recovered, but then started taking acid again and withina few weeks had to be hospitalized. I lost track of him after that. He was abeautiful soul. I hope he recovered and went on to live an interesting life, asI have a feeling he did.While most of my close friends were committed stoners, they weren’t disengagedfrom school activities. Clint, for instance, was active in band and sports andwon a state wrestling championship that year. Others were in the debate anddrama societies, which is where I ended up. My experience in Paonia under Mack’stutelage had given me a taste for drama, and I seemed to have a talent for it. Iwas delighted when I found that my new school had an active drama program, andfound myself in the leading role in the senior class play, Agatha Christie’sWitness for the Prosecution. I played the Queen’s Consul, Sir Wilfred Robarts,opposite a guy named Rory as the solicitor, Mayhew, and we were both well cast.Rory was totally straight, another high achiever and a nice guy. And yet I foundhim boring precisely because, unlike Clint, he seemed to lack a dark side, whichis to say, a complete personality. Academically, we were all high achievers. Theidea that smoking dope means one will have poor grades is simply a lie. I smokeddope several times a week, along with my friends, and we had no problem keepingup with our work. One effect it did have, though, was that it made much ofschool seem pointless—just mere busy work to keep us off the streets as much asanything.In our last semester, however, I persuaded our teachers to try out aTussman-style program like the one that led Terence into so many obscure bywaysof Western and Eastern thought, helping him learn to think in the process. Bythen my friends and I had already completed our graduation requirements, so thefaculty let a small group of us spend the spring reading and discussing variousworks, all toward the supposed end of writing a massive paper. Because I hadsuggested the idea (and been blessed to have Terence’s library at my disposalwhile he was traveling) I heavily influenced the reading list. We spent ourfinal semester sampling Jung, Eliade, and McLuhan, leavened by the occasionalpiece by Aldous Huxley or William Burroughs, and a little black magic thrown in.It was actually a very productive way to use our time, and I learned quite abit. Clint and I were the only ones who actually wrote a final paper, but itdidn’t really matter. The others got exposed to a lot of heretical ideas theywould not have otherwise have known, which was my point.Despite my misadventure with datura the previous year, I had another encounterwith the nightshades that spring, courtesy of John Parker. John, you’ll recall,was a scholar and keeper of esoteric knowledge, from alchemy and black magic toherbal lore and altered states. He was also one of the most influential of myearly mentors, and we’d been corresponding since we’d gotten to know each otherin Berkeley in the summer of 1967. Among the topics we’d been exchangingthoughts on that spring were witches’ flying unguents. These were topicalconcoctions that usually contained extracts of belladonna or henbane, sometimeswith very toxic plants like monkshood (Aconitum spp.) or even hashish and opium.Such ointments were allegedly the secret to how witches could fly to theirrituals on a broomstick. They didn’t actually fly; they used the broom as anapplicator, to apply the unguent to their labia where these substances could bereadily absorbed. The resulting state of delirium and disorientation produced bythe tropane alkaloids, combined with the cardiac arrhythmias induced by themonkshood, would induce a feeling of rising and falling, and rushing headlongthrough the air—hence, of flying. The participation in the eldritch andorgiastic rites of the witches’ Sabbath was, under this model, a pureconfabulation, as the witches fell into a dreamlike stupor.John had stumbled across a formulation he attempted to duplicate, though for thebaby’s fat and bat’s blood in the original formula he substituted lanolin. Whenhe sent me a sample my friends and I were just crazy enough to give it a shot.We set out one moonlit night into the high desert of the Uncompahgre Plateaujust out of town. The plateau’s name is a Ute word meaning “dirty water.” Thearea has many gulches and arroyos, rocks, and caves, and lots of solitude.Carlos Castaneda’s first book, The Teachings of Don Juan, had come out a fewmonths earlier, and we’d all read it, priming us for some serious shamanicaction.There were four of us, if I recall. We reached a place that had the right feel,with a low overhang of rock to shelter us, and proceeded to strip down and smearthe god-awful green slime all over our bodies. Then we sat down to wait. An hourpassed. Nothing. Another hour. Still nothing. Finally we decided that we neededto dance or something to facilitate the absorption, so we jumped around chantingand hooting—four gangly teenagers covered in green goo, comporting themselvesunder the desert moon like demented apes. Fortunately, we had chosen oursecluded spot well. Had any of our classmates come upon us we would have hadsome serious explaining to do. After perhaps another hour we realized theunguent had failed to produce the desired effects. I guess it needed the babyfat and bat’s blood, but that was a bit too authentic even for John.Reluctantly, we wiped off the goo as best we could and packed it in.The rest of the semester passed uneventfully. Like high school seniorseverywhere, my peers and I were burnt out. We lost no time in scattering towhatever destinies were in store for us: summer jobs, further schooling,military service, or exile to Canada; the Vietnam War was at its peak. I wasmore than ready to leave home and get on to the next big thing, whatever thatwould be. Accepted at CU, I knew I’d see many of my new friends in Boulder atsummer’s end; but by late May all I wanted was freedom. I had a job lined up forthe summer in Aspen, working on the grounds maintenance crew at the Aspen MusicSchool. This was a step up compared to my lowly status as a dishwasher atCyrano’s the previous summer. Skipping the graduation ceremony, I left GrandJunction the day after classes ended, my diploma eventually reaching me by mail.Aspen and unknown adventures beckoned. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 25 - Busted Again: 1969 My mother and I returned to Paonia, but my stay was brief. My father had a ’59Chevy Impala with enormous fins, a beater he’d been keeping at the airport inMontrose so he could fly in and cover his territory without having to rent acar. He generously gave it to me for the summer and flew me over to Montrose topick it up. The wheels were a kind of graduation present, and just what Ineeded. I packed up the Chevy with a few basic necessities and headed to Aspento start my job.I found a tiny apartment in a condo-like building on a side street in aresidential part of town. Every day, my fellow workers and I would catch a busthat took us a few miles up Castle Creek to the campus. There we’d do whateverchores we were assigned—mowing, trimming shrubs, sweeping out the practice roomsand generally tidying up. It was easy enough to slip into one of those rooms ona break and blast a joint. Supervision was minimal and the work was goodexercise. There were a lot of pretty music students around, though as a lowlymaintenance grunt I was too timid to try to befriend them.Into this scene came Lisa. I’ve already mentioned how I first met Lisa, or atleast saw her, on my visit to Berkeley in 1967. Two years later, there she wasin Aspen, seeking a place to study Pure Land Buddhism, inspired by Secrets ofChinese Meditation, a book by Charles Luk. Lisa had a friend in town I’ll callErin, a willowy blonde who had fallen in with my friend Richard. Encouraged byErin, Lisa and I got together and soon were sharing my apartment. According toLisa (I remember none of this), the landlord was spying on us and we werepromptly evicted. We moved to a studio apartment in the back of a house, adistinct step up as it had a private entrance and a primitive kitchen. We livedthere for much of that summer until events brought our short idyll to an end.Our intimacy was a breakthrough for me, a chance to continue my sexualeducation, and Lisa proved a gentle and wise instructor. I had not had anysexual encounters (or no successful ones, and not for lack of trying) since myfurtive episode with Fay two years earlier. Lisa was an angel of mercy who cameinto my life just when I needed to be rescued. She was very delicate; she hadmany allergies and was prone to getting sick, but she had a good soul. Wise inthe ways of herbs and astrology, she was a good guitar player and singer, a goodcook, a good lover. She taught me many things, but I was too inexperienced togive back in kind. I’ve since apologized for being so inept; I had thought shemust have taken pity on me to put up with such awkwardness. I was pleased tohear she’d never felt that way, and that the mutual passion we felt made up formy lack of experience.Nevertheless, I didn’t return her affection in the way she might have wanted.The crucial reason was that I was still hung up on Peggy, and still clinging tohopes we’d get together in Boulder that fall. During those years, it was apattern of my erotic life that I spent much of it longing for someone out ofreach, someone I couldn’t have for one reason or another, to the neglect of theperson I was actually with. It wasn’t fair to that person, or to myself, becauseit kept me from fully committing to the relationship. And so it was with Lisa.Ultimately, however, that wouldn’t be what pulled us apart.During that summer, Terence, then rambling through India, had been sending backhashish shipments from Mumbai, still known then as Bombay. Aspen, he thought,was the perfect out-of-the-way spot for these shipments to arrive, and a friendof his, Brett, was there to receive them. For Terence, this was a ramped-upversion of what he’d been doing the previous summer when we picked up thesmashed Buddha statue at the post office. At least then he’d made an effort toconceal the goods, however inadequately. At some point, however, he seemed tohave thrown caution to the wind and started sending his shipments barelyconcealed in locked tin boxes. That seemed rather reckless to me, and mymisgivings proved correct.Several packages arrived without incident, picked up at any number of rentedP.O. boxes up and down the valley. Most of the product was then taken to Denverand turned over to Tom, who had plenty of hash-starved customers ready topurchase whatever he had for sale. Brett, impatient and a little greedy, wasquite happy to sell ounces locally, and in fact out the door of his cottage. Iknew because he was living in the same cluster of cottages as Lisa and I. Ithought he should show some restraint, but he didn’t listen; soon, half thehippies in town were beating a path to his door. His place quickly became widelyknown as the go-to source for the best hash to hit Aspen in months, maybe ever.As it turned out, his actions didn’t make much difference. When the end arrived,it came from a completely unexpected direction. Most people with counterculture ties back then remember where they were onWoodstock weekend, August 16-17, 1969. I certainly do, but the famous musicfestival was not the reason why. I spent that weekend in the county jail inGlenwood Springs, awaiting transfer to a federal detention facility in Denver,where my companions and I were to be arraigned on hashish smuggling charges thefollowing Monday. It went down like this:I worked at the Aspen Music School until the end of July and then began gettingready to move to Boulder for the start of classes. Brett had temporarily movedin with Lisa and me, a cramped but tolerable situation, given that we’d only besharing the space for a couple of weeks. But Lisa wanted nothing to do with asmuggling conspiracy. Deciding to bail early, we arrived in Boulder in the firstweek of August and found an apartment. Luckily, she stayed there when I headedback to Aspen to finish packing up.In the course of moving out, we’d stored some dishes and linens at a house inGlenwood Springs, about forty-five miles north of Aspen. On the day I leftAspen, I wanted to pick up those boxes before continuing over McClure Pass for abrief visit in Paonia. It was a sunny Thursday, August 14, when I pulled out inthe old Chevy. As best I can recall, Erin and Richard had plans to spend theweekend at the house in Glenwood, and Brett decided to drive his own car over tosee them. He also wanted to check the post offices in Snowmass and Basalt,because one of Terence’s shipments had been delayed. Two packages had alreadycome through, but not the third, so he was concerned there might be a glitch. Wedrove separately to the post office in Basalt, and I waited in my car while hewent inside to check. When he emerged carrying a large muslin-wrapped packageand a big smile I realized the Good Shit had arrived. We continued on to thehouse in Glenwood in our separate cars.In the parking area in front of the house, Brett locked his car but didn’t bringanything in. I remember Erin being there, but not Richard. I went down to thebasement to get my boxes, and when I came up Brett was looking worriedly outthrough the drawn curtains of the living-room window. There were two or threecars visible from the house with two men sitting in each. Not a welcome sight:it looked like the place was staked out. Brett decided to leave and take thepackage back to Aspen or try to ditch it somewhere, but by then it was too late.Both cars converged on his, blocking his exit, while four men emerged from thecar, guns ready, and forced Brett out of the car. He stood there, helpless, armsoutstretched, while two of the men came up to the house and called us out. I’msure we all looked shocked and confused, and more than a little scruffy, as weemerged. Before long we were in handcuffs being booked at the county jail.We were sequestered in separate cells, and left to chill for a couple of hours,pondering our grim fates. I was despairing and traumatized. I wasn’t a “badkid,” let alone a criminal, despite that little session back in Paonia two yearsearlier. I was just a hippie who liked to smoke a little hash and groove onpsychedelics. Now here I was in the slammer. But this was worse. This wasserious shit. This was a federal bust of an international smuggling ring.By the time I was collected from my cell and ushered into an interrogation room,I’d had plenty of time to reflect on the error of my ways and to conjure up somedreary scenarios of where I was headed as a result. Agent Grissom, as I’ll callhim, a narcotics enforcement officer with U.S. Customs, was tall, elegant, andsoft-spoken; his colleague was short and squat, had a fat face, and looked likehe was a bit too fond of those jelly donuts that cops are supposed to like. Inthis case, it was the fat jolly one who played the good cop. He was friendlyenough as he explained to me that this was not about whether I liked to smokegrass or not; this was a felony conspiracy to import a dangerous drug, and theyexpected me to tell them everything I knew. Meanwhile, Grissom, playing the badcop, kept his silence and just looked at me with pity and loathing, as if tosay, “You poor sap, you are so fucked.” Well, I was fucked. I don’t recall anyrecitation of my rights, or anyone advising me that I didn’t have to talk tothese guys. But I resisted. I insisted that I wasn’t part of the conspiracy,that I was just a friend of the others, and that I had no part in the smugglingoperation. I had not received shipments nor had I sold any hash or facilitatedany sales.In fact, this was true; but circumstantially it didn’t look good. After all, Ihad been hanging out with the others all summer. Brett was even staying in ourapartment, and Lord knows I was quite happy to smoke the abundant hash. But wasthere direct evidence linking me to the conspiracy? Not really, and associationwith criminals does not necessarily make one a criminal. But I didn’t know thatat the time.In fact it became clear that they had no background information on the case.Richard got picked up later, but the authorities didn’t know Brett had beenliving in my apartment; they didn’t know about Lisa, who had already moved toBoulder. For them, the case began with the package they’d tracked to the Basaltpost office. They produced my wallet, which they’d taken earlier, and startedgoing through the paper scraps in it, scribbled grocery lists and phone numbersand so forth. One of those was the smoking gun: Terence’s address in Bombay!They jumped on that, and pressed me: had Terence originated the shipment? He wasthe one, wasn’t he? If you confirm this for us, they said, if you rat on yourbrother and your buddies, we’ll make sure you get released when you’re arraignedin federal court on Monday. It was obvious that Terence was on the other end ofthe Bombay to Aspen pipeline; who else could it be? I broke down completely, andin tears I confessed: “Yes, it’s all true!”Looking back on this, I am still ashamed. What kind of a worm rats out his ownbrother? I did it then, I didn’t see any alternative, and I’m not proud of it.What can I say? I was eighteen. I was scared out of my wits. And the cops wereplaying me like a fiddle. I got no Miranda warning, so I when I was interrogatedI was under the impression I really had no rights. The cops did their best toreinforce that belief, to make me think they were ready to lock me up for goodright then and there. Had I known of my rights, I’d like to think I would haveresisted and, as in the movies, thrown it back in their faces: “You’ll nevermake me talk, you dirty coppers.” It’s a little different when you’re aterrified kid.Terence’s address in my wallet was the damning evidence, and I think it wouldhave been even if I’d said nothing. Under the circumstances, I may well haveconfessed even if I had been read my rights. Then again, had I been able to talkto an attorney, I would have learned that the case against me was weak. The factthat I had driven to Glenwood in my own car and happened to be at the house whenthe bust went down was not sufficient evidence to charge me. And a good attorneywould have told me that. The cops were able to assure me that I’d be releasedafter my arraignment because they knew very well they lacked the evidence tohold me, and they would not have held me even if I’d said nothing. But theydidn’t divulge that; they played on my fear and ignorance of the law to make mespill.I spent the next two nights in the holding cell at the county jail. My parentsknew I was supposed to come to Paonia that weekend, but I hadn’t been allowed tocontact them, and actually I didn’t want them to know. Foolishly, I thought Icould somehow conceal this from them. Knowing I’d be released on Monday, I wrotethem a letter, sent from jail, assuring them all was well and that I’d be therein a couple of days. It was a total lie of course, but I thought it would buytime, which it did, a little. On Saturday, we were transported in shackles tothe holding pen at the Federal Building in Denver to await our arraignment. Or Ishould say I was transported. I didn’t see the others until the hearing. Thosetwenty-four hours in the holding pen were a real education for me. People werebeing held on all sorts of charges, ranging from drugs to armed robbery. Somewere old hands, career criminals who had been in and out of jail for much oftheir lives. They were a much more cynical bunch. Others were scared kids likeme, in there on pot charges.The next morning, Monday, I was led to the hearing room. My associates werealready there. As we sat waiting, I could not look them in the eyes. I wasconsumed with guilt and shame at my supposed betrayal, about which they knewnothing. But I also saw a path to redeem myself, at least partially. The hearingopened, and I was called up first. Agent Grissom and his buddy were as good astheir word, or so I thought. The judge said, “As to the case of Dennis McKenna,no charges will be filed as there is insufficient evidence to charge him.” I wasenormously relieved, unaware that I would have heard those words even if I’dsaid nothing. Afterward, I was allowed to leave, but not until I’d watched myfriends being shepherded back to their cells.In retrospect, I have to marvel at how limited the police work was. The toolsfor investigation and surveillance were relatively primitive back then, beforeGPS and the Internet. They had no idea where we lived in Aspen, or even who wewere when they made the bust. They apparently knew that a shipment was comingin, addressed to unknown persons, and they had staked out the post office,waiting for someone to claim the package. That’s where they picked up the trail.As a result, they were unaware that another one had been picked up withoutincident at a different post office a few days earlier. That package was stillsitting in the closet at the apartment back in Aspen, waiting for Tom to collectit and sell it in Denver, as earlier arranged.My task was clear: I somehow had to get the package in Aspen and hide it in asafe place, then show Tom its location so he could retrieve it later. I’d justbeen sprung; I was loose on the streets of Denver with no car and very littlemoney. Then I had an idea. I called up a guy named Brandon I’d met a few monthsearlier. Brandon had a sleek sports car and a sleek girlfriend, both of which Iadmired. I phoned him up and explained the situation. I offered to give him someof the Good Shit if he’d drive me back to Aspen to get the stuff and then takeme somewhere to hide it. He agreed; in fact, he said it would be fun.Brandon and his girlfriend picked me up a few blocks from the Federal Building,and we headed west over the mountains. When we arrived in Aspen, I told them topark a few blocks from my former cottage and wait while I checked out the place,wary of a trap. It was late and the place was quiet. I’d sequestered a key nearthe entrance, so I didn’t have to break in, but I still feared I’d be arrestedin some crazy scene as cops burst out of the bathroom. But I had to do it; thiswas my chance to help my friends, an obligation I felt most acutely since I hadbetrayed them, or so I thought.No one was there; the hash, in its metal box, was still in the closet. Ireturned to the car, and we drove back and collected the package and took it upto the secluded lake outside of Snowmass where I’d hung out the summer before.We found a spot that looked like it would be easy to locate again, dug a hole,and buried the package—that is, after I’d cut my driver his chunk. With the deedcomplete, we started back over the mountains.It was a clear, moonlit night. There was no Eisenhower Tunnel back then; to getto Denver from the Western Slope you had to cross the Continental Divide viaLoveland Pass, about 12,000 feet at the summit—a spectacular place, but terriblycold at night, even in August. We had almost made it to the summit when we sawlights flashing behind us. My heart jumped. It was three in the morning, and wewere the only ones on the road. This had to be it! I was sure the cops hadfollowed us all the way to Aspen and back, ever since they’d turned me looseafter the hearing. We sat petrified, hunkered down in the car, as the copapproached the driver’s side, the typical picture of a state trooper: helmet,wraparound shades (yes, shades) glinting in the moonlight, revolver in hisholster, the whole bit.“Some problem, officer?” Brandon said.“Did you know you have a taillight out on the left side? Better have that lookedat when you get back to Denver.”“Yes, officer, why thanks, officer, no, I didn’t know,” Brandon said, “I’ll takecare of it right away.”He bid us a good night, and without even a warning ticket we drove on. I hadpractically fainted and was literally shaking. I was grateful that Brandon didnot affect a hippie style. No long hair or wild clothes, he looked quiterespectable, like a clean-cut preppie college student. I don’t know if that madea difference, but whether it was that or sheer dumb luck, we had ducked apotentially disastrous outcome.Brandon let me off in Boulder at about six in the morning. I was completelyexhausted. I went to our new apartment and woke Lisa. She already knew from Tomwhat had happened but was still frantic for the details. I related the wholesorry tale, from the bust in Glenwood to our mad run to Aspen and back. But Iwas not done. I still had to return to Snowmass with Tom so I could show himwhere the stuff was stashed.For Lisa, who had wanted no part of these dealings from the start, this was thelast straw. She decided to leave Boulder and return that same day to Berkeley. Iagreed, though I knew it meant the end of our relationship. Indeed, I would notsee her again for years.After getting in touch with Tom, he and I decided to catch a plane back toAspen. Our friends were still in jail waiting to be released on bail. To get theprocess rolling presumably meant retrieving and selling some of the hash. As wetook off from Stapleton Airport sitting in the back of a chartered six-seater,Tom pulled out a tiny cellophane bag with a few crumbs of hash in it and wavedit before me. I was appalled at his recklessness, but he just laughed.Flying to Aspen took about an hour. We rented a car and headed for the lakeabove Snowmass where I’d buried the stash some hours earlier. We walked in onfoot; there was no sign of any disturbance or ambush. I pointed out the locationto Tom, and we got back to the car and drove to Glenwood. The idea was that he’dreturn for the package later and take it to Denver, and I assume that’s what hedid.I found my car in the parking lot, keys still in it, outside the house wherewe’d been caught. My parents had gotten the letter I’d sent from jail at aboutthe same time they were reading an article in the Daily Sentinel about the bust.Needless to say, the conflicting accounts had created some confusion anddistress. They had heard that we’d been taken to the courthouse in Denver, butnot that I’d been released. Based on that, Mom and Dad had immediately driven toDenver to bail me out. By then I had already made my clandestine trip to Aspenand back, returned to Aspen with Tom on the plane, and found my way to the sceneof the bust a few days earlier to get my car.When we finally did connect, my mother was sick with worry and my father wasboth worried and furious. I couldn’t blame him. I told them I’d be driving backto Paonia that evening, which I did. I was completely thrashed and almost fellasleep at the wheel several times, but finally I made it to the empty house. Myparents, meanwhile, were driving back from Denver.When they arrived the next morning I’d had at least a few hours sleep. The scenewas tense. My father was out of his mind with anger, and appropriately so. Therewas nothing I could say in my defense, so I said as little as possible. Iexplained what had gone down, including Terence’s connection to the mess. He wasoff in India somewhere; a Bombay address at least a couple of months old was thelast one we had, and we weren’t sure he knew yet what had happened. It speaksamazingly well of our father that, despite his fury at the two of us, his hatredof drugs and anything to do with them, he still saw it as his duty to protecthis son.In doing so, he probably committed a felony himself. He sent two cables toTerence’s last known address: “Interpol is looking for you, get out now!” Apretty unambiguous message. Meanwhile, the others had been released and had sentTerence a more cryptic message: “Colorado Fuel and Iron gone down.” That wastheir code name for the operation, Colorado Fuel and Iron, named after thecompany founded by John C. Osgood, the builder of the Redstone Inn. In eithercase, the message was clear. Something had gone seriously wrong, and Terenceneeded to hightail it out of wherever he was.He got both messages and immediately dropped off the radar. No one heard fromhim for several weeks; we had no idea where he was. It wasn’t until the end ofSeptember that a postcard finally arrived, dated three weeks previously,postmarked Benares, and signed by one HCE, a reference to a character in Joyce’sFinnegans Wake. This would become his nom de guerre over the next year, as hemoved clandestinely from country to country, hiding out. Postcards from HCEshowed up irregularly, tracking his travels, in southern India, then Thailand,then ever more remote locations in the Indonesian archipelago as he made his wayto the outer islands in search of butterflies and anonymity, tracking back toTaipei, several months in Tokyo teaching English, finally ending up in Vancouverin the fall of 1970 where I was able to visit him. It was a life on the run. Itmight have even seemed romantic at the time, but the uncertainty of ever beingable to return was worrisome.The legal consequences from this episode have long since been settled, andTerence’s involvement in it has been public knowledge for decades. He discussedthe bust in True Hallucinations and elsewhere; it is even mentioned in hisobituary in The New York Times. I haven’t told the story here to depict Terenceand myself as romantic outlaw renegades but rather as a cautionary tale. Likemany eighteen-year-olds, I made some foolish choices, especially under pressure.Whatever my beliefs about one’s right to experience certain altered states, thebust was a searing reminder that the law is the law. And to break the law is toinvite anguish not only into one’s own life but into other lives as well. Following the bust and its aftermath, the waning days of August were fraughtwith tension. I had no cred left with my father, and for good reason. BothTerence and I had disappointed our parents. Our father was either a fool or farmore enlightened than I could understand at the time, and I now believe it wasthe latter. He didn’t approve of us or of what we’d done. But according to hismoral compass, you stood by your kids no matter what they did. He never disownedus, and he never cut off financial support for me, though it was perhaps reallyour mother he was trying to protect. We had hurt her deeply. She had been indelicate health for years, and now with all these new stresses I think Dad wasconcerned that she was at risk for some serious illness. As it turned out, wehad no idea how serious.As the time neared for me to start classes, my father determined that my motherwould take me to Boulder and help me get settled. To provide moral support,Mom’s good friend Marge, the English teacher from whose class I’d been summonedby the sheriff two years before, accompanied us. Marge was wise in ways I hadn’trealized. She was there for Mom, but she also realized I wasn’t a bad kid, justa little misguided, or perhaps a lot misguided; but nonetheless her presencehelped me as well.I had to find a place to live. Mom wanted me to live in the dorm at least forthe first semester, but I was adamantly opposed. I didn’t want to face therestrictions that would entail, especially the restrictions on being able tosmoke dope whenever I wanted. Plus, I was an introvert and repelled by the kindof social interaction that dorm life entailed. So I pushed back. I found anotherplace, a tiny apartment in a three-story hippie house filled with a motleyassortment of freaks, and with a landlord who didn’t much care what you did aslong as you paid the rent on time. It was just what I was looking for! It wasMom’s worst nightmare, for the same reasons. But I insisted, and tried toconvince her it would be OK, and actually Marge came to my defense. So it wasthat I found myself in Number 7, 1507 Pine.Shortly after my mother returned to Paonia she fell and broke her ankle. Herewas yet another challenge, as if the worry we’d caused her wasn’t enough. Shehad always been fragile, and probably at her age, fifty-six, she may have beendeveloping some osteoporosis. This injury further exacerbated the arthritis thatshe was suffering. Although we didn’t realize it at the time, the arthritis andthe ankle injury were harbingers of a much more serious illness she’d face somemonths later. I settled into my studies in the warm autumn of 1969, happy to have the bustbehind me, happy to be in Boulder living on my own. I wasn’t sure what coursesto take; like many freshmen I had no idea what I wanted to specialize in. I knewI wanted to pursue something related to psychedelics, but I was uncertainwhether it would be neuroscience, chemistry, anthropology, or botany. I had avague idea that I wanted to be an ethnobotanist, but there was nothing in thecurriculum that matched that; so I started taking classes in basic botany—planttaxonomy, mostly—and anthropology.One of my classes was an introductory ethnography course taught by Omer Stewart,an authority on the Native American Church, and later the author of PeyoteReligion: A History (1987). As I’ve noted, Carlos Castaneda’s The Teachings ofDon Juan, had come out the previous year and had an enormous impact on me. Sincethen, much if not all of Castaneda’s work has been discredited as confabulation,but that first book may have had some basis in truth. At the time I had noreason to doubt it, nor did I want to doubt it. In fact, I credit it, along withEliade’s work, in fostering my interest in psychedelic shamanism. It provided acontext for the use of psychedelics that I couldn’t find anywhere else at thetime, certainly not from Timothy Leary or the other mass-market gurus. Therevelation for me was that psychedelics were nothing new; rather, they were partof a shamanic tradition stretching way back, possibly to the Paleolithic or evenearlier. If one wanted to understand psychedelics and how to use them, consultthe peoples who had been using them for thousands of years. This made sense tome, and still does.Part of the reason that psychedelics were so disruptive to society (or wereperceived to be) when they burst on the scene in the sixties was that we had nocontext for them. They were not part of the Western religious tradition(although they may once have been, that connection has long since beensuppressed) and their role in witchcraft and alchemy was esoteric knowledge—thatis, largely forbidden knowledge. So psychedelics were fascinating to many of mygeneration, but there was no map, no guidance on their usage that could beadapted to the contemporary societal context; this partly explains why manypeople got into unfortunate situations with them. It was not widely understoodat the time that proper “set” and “setting” were essential to using psychedelicssafely, and for purposes of spiritual discovery and the exploration ofconsciousness. In fact, this is largely what shamanism is: a set of procedures,practices, and beliefs that provide a structure or a context for understandingand controlling the experiences, within limits. Without that context, one isleft to random experimentation without any framework for interpreting theresults. In that respect, I think Castaneda’s first book did a service for ageneration of psychedelic novices. It made us aware that at least there was acontext and a tradition, even if the one he described, through the character ofdon Juan Matus, a supposed Yaqui sorcerer, was largely the product of theauthor’s fertile imagination.While taking Stewart’s class I visited his office to discuss The Teachings,which he had read carefully. He assured me the book almost had to be afabrication; there was nothing in Yaqui traditions that even hinted at thepractices it described. Either Don Juan was an idiosyncratic figure whose beliefsystem bore no relationship to Yaqui culture, or he and his practices had beenconstructed out of whole cloth. Stewart’s critique was a wakeup call. I hadlearned early on a valuable lesson about accepting, without corroboratingevidence, the assertions of self-styled gurus, shamans, and other supposedlywise teachers. It’s good to keep an open mind; there is much we don’t know, asone should never forget. But it’s just as crucial never to sacrifice thecapacity for critical thinking and skepticism. Stewart’s lesson is one that manywho fall prey to cults of one sort or another (and I include most of the majorworld religions here) would do well to heed.The value of skepticism was reinforced in a second course I took that fall, onthe comparative anthropology of religion. To discover the variety of what passedfor religious or spiritual practice was eye-opening. One person’s abomination orblasphemy could easily be another’s sincere belief. I remember reading WhenProphecy Fails by Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken, and Stanley Schachter, firstpublished in 1956. It’s the study of a Midwestern UFO cult that claimed to bechanneling messages from aliens. Newly recruited members were told they’d bepicked up on a specific date and saved from the imminent end of the world. Themembers quit their jobs, gave up their possessions, and gathered together,waiting to be saved. When the appointed date came and went, they grew even moreconvinced that the revelations were valid. It wasn’t until two later predictionsalso failed that members became disillusioned and the cult fell apart. The caseis an interesting commentary on the folly of human belief systems, includingmost millenarian cults. The dynamic of the true believer is much too prevalentin today’s mass consciousness, and in political and religious discourse: My mindis made up, don’t confuse me with facts!All this amounts to a cautionary tale for those anticipating the end of historyas predicted by Terence and others for the winter solstice in 2012—or on anyother such date. No prophecy of major global catastrophe or the end of historyhas ever come true. Terrible events can and do happen in both human and naturalhistory, but prophets cannot predict them. And yet it is virtually certain thatsome believers will find a way to rationalize the fact of a prophecy provenwrong. From a sociological perspective, it will be interesting to observe whathappens in the days before and after the latest in a long line of suchpredictions. I don’t expect the world to end, of course, but it wouldn’tsurprise me if there were major social disruptions resulting from mass hysteria.Much of my education during that first semester in Boulder did not occur in theclassroom. It happened when my friend and mentor John Parker came out fromCalifornia and spent several weeks with me in my apartment. John and I had beencarrying on regular correspondence for a couple of years. His eclecticinterests—in drugs, magic, shamanism, biology, chemistry, alchemy—likewisefascinated me. Our hashish-fueled conversations lasting well into the wee hourswere a supreme pleasure. During those weeks together, we explored many of theideas that Terence and I would later call upon to force open the portal tohyperspace at La Chorrera. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 26 - Girl with a Gun: 1970 John eventually returned to Berkeley, and I finished my first semester inBoulder. The end of that semester corresponded to the end of the sixties, thoughthat troubled decade’s social ferment continued undiminished. The Vietnam Wardragged on; Nixon’s illegal invasion of Cambodia in late April 1970 sparkedcampus protests across the country, leading to the Kent State shootings on May4. At CU, a large portion of the student body took to the streets, and I wasamong them. I had turned nineteen the previous December just weeks after thedraft lottery went into effect. Though I had a student deferment, the lotterysaved me from any risk of being drafted because I had a very high number.Nevertheless, I was as outraged as many of my contemporaries, and our protestsshut down the university for the rest of the semester. All final exams werecanceled; most of the faculty supported the protests, and students were awardedwhatever grades they had before the protests started, so I got off easy. Therewas no real assessment of my performance after my first year, and many of mypeers were in the same position.I may have come quite close to dying during one of those protests. I wasstanding in a large group one day that had blocked off University Avenue,between downtown Boulder and the campus on “the Hill.” The cops had cordoned offthe street below and were directing traffic away from the crowd, which numberedmaybe a thousand kids. Suddenly a car broke through the barricades and racedtoward us, as if its driver was bent on mowing us down. But suddenly it stopped,screeching to a halt very near to where I stood. The woman in the car had thewindows rolled up and the doors locked. She was obviously in some sort ofdistress, though it was hard to tell if she was angry or scared, let alone whyshe’d driven into the crowd in the first place. I started to reach for thehandle of her car door, I don’t know why. I didn’t want to haul her out of thecar; I had some idea of inviting her to get out and join the protest. Then I sawthe gun she was cradling in her arm, her white-knuckled grip on the handle, andI froze. If I’d made any further threatening move, I think I would have beenshot dead. Instead I had that “whoa” moment, put my hands up and backed slowlyaway. By this time everyone nearby had noticed the gun, and the crowd got quietand moved away, opening a space around the car. The driver put the car in gearand slowly drove back down the hill in the direction she had come from. It was asobering moment for everyone—one of those bifurcations in the time stream thatcould have gone very differently.But I spent most of my days that school year over books, not in the streets.After John left, I continued my academic studies while the two of us pursued ouresoteric explorations via letters. Most of my spare time was somewhathermit-like; I spent long hours at home smoking hashish while reading andstudying various obscure tomes in the company of the coal-black cat, Ahriman,that Lisa and I had adopted over the summer and brought with us to Boulder. Ialso got to know my neighbors across the hall, Hans and Nancy, the hippie coupleliving in Number 6. Hans, whose parents were Dutch, had grown up in Boulder;Nancy, his new wife, was the daughter of a wealthy Denver family. Hans was agood carpenter and made his living that way. We became close friends over thosetwo semesters at 1507 Pine and have remained so ever since.Into the spring of 1970, Terence remained off the radar, still hiding out in theobscure backwaters of Southeast Asia. My parents would occasionally getpostcards from HCE as he slowly worked his way to the outer islands of theIndonesian archipelago in search of butterflies and anonymity. Ourcorrespondence lapsed for a while; there was no place to send a letter becauseit was impossible to know where HCE would turn up next. After a few months ofsuch rambling, faced with evaporating finances, he ended up teaching in Tokyo inone of the English mills that were ready sources of temporary employment foritinerant travelers. I welcomed this development because it was an opportunityto renew our regular correspondence.My longed-for love, Peggy, had started school in Boulder in the fall but leftfor New Mexico in the spring. This disappointed me because it meant there was nochance to get better acquainted, despite a few pleasant moments spent togetherearly in that school year. She was invariably nice to me, but my passions werenot reciprocated. I clung to the hope that I’d have another chance to gettogether with her when she returned after the semester, but reality intrudedwhen she did. I discovered she’d met someone else, only to have thatrelationship fall apart, leaving her sobered and saddened. I was furious andheartbroken, though I knew I had no real justification for such feelings. A merecasual friend, I had no claim on her; and yet, if only she had stayed, we mighthave developed something together. Or so I told myself. It was a completedelusion, of course. But the heart does not listen to logic or reason; it is acreature of pure emotion; it knows only what it wants, and it knows only painwhen it doesn’t get what it wants.I did my best to present a facade of sympathy to her. She was not in a happyplace either. She knew she had screwed up badly, had made some bad decisions andwanted to move beyond feelings that were surely quite similar to mine in thewake of her ill-considered relationship. I did my best to be kind, though inreality I was seething with jealousy. I wanted nothing more than to track downthe monster who had despoiled my perfect, pure, virginal angel and tear him limbfrom limb. I also knew that had the tables been turned I would have done thesame thing.The denouement of that very depressing spring came when my father arrived totake me back to Paonia for the summer. My mother had been feeling increasinglypoorly all winter, ever since she’d broken her ankle the previous September.She’d suffered from arthritis for years, and that accident had made it worse.She had gone to the Penrose Cancer Center in Colorado Springs, one of thepremiere oncology centers in the country at that time, not because she thoughtshe had cancer, but because severe arthritis often accompanies cancer, and shethought they might have new treatments that would help her. It didn’t take longfor these trained oncologists to uncover the much grimmer truth: She hadmetastatic bone cancer and probably had only months to live. Cancer, notarthritis, was the cause of her severe joint pain and fragile bones. Now it wasclear. She had undoubtedly broken her ankle because even then her bones werelosing their strength. Our family physician had misdiagnosed her problem becausehe lacked the training or had misinterpreted the signs. Years later, in my ownreading on the topic, I found that bone cancer was the most common sequela ofbreast cancer, which my mother had survived five years previously. In fact, justprior to her ankle fracture she had passed the five-year threshold that wasthought to signify that she was cancer-free. Though I don’t blame her doctor formissing the diagnosis, catching the cancer nine months earlier might havebettered her chances. As it was, it was too late; Mom did not live to see theend of the year.We did not realize then, at the end of May, that there was no realistic hope fora cure. Dad was utterly shattered, but also completely determined to make sureMom got the benefit of whatever modern medicine could bring to bear on thisterrible disease, costs be damned. Dad was fighting to save the love of hislife. I was there with him, fighting to save my mother, so long neglected, sowounded by her children. There was no question of staying in Boulder or findingwork elsewhere that summer. I needed and wanted to be at home.What followed was an endless series of trips to Colorado Springs where Mom wasgiven chemotherapy and radiation treatments. That’s what was available in thosedays, and it’s dismaying how little progress there has been in forty-two years.The radical, debilitating treatments that were applied then are not thatdifferent from those used today. They cause severe fatigue, make your hair fallout, and destroy your immune system. The treatments are torture for the persongetting them, and a great distress for the loved ones who must watch someonethey love suffer so much. Bone cancer itself is extremely painful. Mom nevercomplained. She never said she was in pain, though she must have been. She hadsevere nausea from the chemotherapy, and I wanted to get her some cannabis tohelp control the nausea. It was just beginning to be recognized that cannabiscould help control chemo-induced nausea and pain. For once, Dad was actuallyopen to the idea that it might help. He was ready to try anything. It was mymother who nixed the idea, mostly, I think, because she didn’t want to offendhim. I felt a lot of guilt over what had happened. I understood I hadn’t causedher cancer, but I did feel that the stress I’d caused her during the hashishcaper might have compromised her immune system and made it harder to fight offthe cancer. This wasn’t rational; she’d undoubtedly had cancer for months beforeshe’d broken her ankle. Nevertheless there was still a feeling that had I been abetter son and caused her less worry things might have turned out differently. So Ahriman and I returned to Paonia and prepared to settle in for what was sureto be a glum summer. By this time, my friend Craze had relocated to Boulder andneeded temporary quarters, so I sublet him my apartment after a promise he’dvacate it when I returned for school.I’d been in Paonia for about a month when my friend Tom, who had been workingconstruction for his brother in Denver, also showed up. His brother’s contracthad ended, meaning no job, so Tom decided to see what work he could find aroundPaonia. I was delighted by this news. We got along well, and he had ready accessto good drugs, thanks to the contacts he’d made selling hash. I had few otherfriends left in town, but it seemed the summer might not be as slow as I hadfeared.Tom also had a new girlfriend. By the time I met Deborah she was a teenagerunaway. She’d been living with her folks in California near a penitentiarywhere her father worked as a guard. Like a lot of young people back then, shewas in active rebellion against her parents, who were strict fundamentalists.She’d been visiting a cousin in Denver when Tom and a friend had picked them upat an amusement park. The girls were looking for fun and excitement, and Tom andhis companion were happy to provide it. It was the perfect concatenation ofdesire and opportunity. Deborah didn’t want to return to her repressive parents;Tom was interested basically in casual sex, and she was willing. So Deborah wenton the lam and lit out for the Western Slope with her new lover. Tom couldn’tshow up at his parents’ home with a runaway girl in tow, so they established aremote camp on Hubbard Creek, a few miles past the spot where we’d conducted ourpsychedelic fishing trips in the fall of 1967.I first met Deborah when she and Tom made a trip into town and dropped by tosmoke a bowl. My mother, I believe, was in Colorado Springs for the first of herradiation treatments, and my father may have been in Delta or Grand Junctionplaying golf with his friends, as he did most weekends. Deborah was a hippiechick: small and slender, almost scrawny, with long strawberry-blonde hair; sheeven had blonde eyelashes, and the reddish complexion and freckles typical ofredheads. She was not stunningly beautiful; she was merely pretty, and clearlyvulnerable. My first impression was that there wasn’t a thought in her head. Shewas on the run, and Tom was only too happy to contribute to her delinquency. Icould fault Tom for being an opportunist, but in ways it was a mutualexploitation. When we met that first time I found her attractive, but she wasTom’s lady, and I wasn’t about to infringe.That changed a few weeks later. I was making periodic trips to Colorado Springsto be with my mother during her treatments, which weren’t helping. My father andI, however, weren’t ready to admit what was grimly obvious. I was in denial; Ididn’t want to think about it. We were fortunate, however, in that one of myfather’s best friends, a fellow salesman for Central Electric, lived in ColoradoSprings and had offered to let my mother stay in his home. This was an excellentand kindly gesture, given how debilitated and fatigued my mother was much of thetime. Making frequent trips back and forth to Paonia would have been extremelyhard on her.Around mid-August, I returned from one of my stays in Colorado Springs and madethe trek up Hubbard Creek to see Tom and Deborah. Upon arriving, I quicklyrealized the bloom was off the rose. Deborah’s prolonged stay in the wildernesshad taken its toll. She looked even scrawnier than when I’d met her, as if shewasn’t eating well, and was covered with scabs, bruises, and bug bites. Tom,working on various jobs, had grown accustomed to leaving her alone, sometimesfor days at a time. As a runaway, she had little recourse but to put up with it.For his part, Tom was growing tired of her. He grumbled to me that she hadnothing to say, and she didn’t know how to cook. Having someone to cook forhimwas important, something he expected in a woman, but Deborah was“lecherouslylazy” as he put it. In his view, women existed to provide sex, to cook, and tokeep house, not necessarily in that order. There was no equality in hisrelationship with Deborah, let alone love or tenderness. For Tom, it was arelationship of convenience that had grown inconvenient.Deborah could sense this and the situation was tense; she was trapped. I feltbad for her in her obvious distress. My attitudes toward women were perhaps notthat much more refined than Tom’s at the time, but I could empathize withsomeone’s pain. I felt Deborah’s plight and, yes, a strong sexual attraction toher. That was not blunted when I rose from my sleeping bag early the nextmorning and spied her bathing, naked, in the stream a few yards away. I avertedmy eyes, but couldn’t help an occasional glance. I said nothing to her aboutthis, much less to Tom; but in a brief glance when my eyes had met hers, I knewI had to “rescue” her.The opportunity came about a week later. Tom had gone to Grand Junction on a jobfor a few days, leaving Deborah alone at the camp with barely enough food, and agun. I knew this was my chance. I started up to Hubbard Creek one moonlessnight. It was hard to find the trail in the dark, and I hadn’t brought aflashlight. I went crashing through the forest, making a lot of noise. Finally Isaw the glimmer of a campfire; then I saw Deborah, standing in the clearing,terrified and holding the gun.“Don’t shoot!” I shouted. “It’s me!” She lowered the gun as I stepped into thefirelight. She was immensely relieved, though not as relieved as I was. It wasthe second time in the past year that I’d nearly gotten shot.She was no doubt happy to have any company, but especially happy to have mine.We sat by the fire and smoked some weed, and then some cigarettes, and talkedawhile. I expressed my desire and attraction for her, and told her I abhorredthe way Tom was treating her and that I intended to help her. One thing led toanother, as these things will, and we soon were in her sleeping bag with ourclothes off making love. Thus began an attachment between us that would last foryears. Whatever Deborah’s faults—and she had her share, as I would learn—sheenjoyed sex. Her childlike enthusiasm and seemingly uncomplicated emotions werejust what I needed at that moment in my life. Afterward, I promised to get herout of there. She could go to Boulder, I said, and stay with the friend who wasliving in my apartment. I’d be arriving in about ten days to start the newsemester. The next day I took her to Delta and gave her the bus fare to Boulder.I also contacted Craze and let him know what was coming his way. I trusted himenough to believe he’d look after her.I expected an unpleasant confrontation with Tom when he found out I’d stolen hisgirlfriend. In fact, I was worried that he would beat the hell out of me, whichhe easily could have done. But instead he was relieved. He’d gotten tired of herand was wondering whether to send her back to California or perhaps even abandonher, he said, although I doubt the latter would have happened; Tom might havebeen a Neanderthal but he wasn’t a monster. In any event, it seemed I’d neatlysolved his problem.The situation was a lot more complicated when I showed up in Boulder. It turnedout Craze had immediately pounced on Deborah, and she’d given in. I guess youcould say her boundaries were loosely defined. Then again, what are you going todo when you are a desirable and naive waif dependent on the kindness ofstrangers? Their brief fling quickly ended. All Craze had to do was to be hisusual weird self and that put Deborah off. By the time I arrived, she’d takenrefuge next door with Hans and Nancy.I wasn’t angry with her, but I was furious with Craze, and not only because hehad moved in on my new girlfriend. He also refused to give up my apartment! Butanother unit had just opened up, and better yet it was bigger. Deborah and Iwere soon installed in Number 9. Craze remained in Number 7, but he appeared tohave been neutralized. "},{"pageContent":"Part Two - Into the Abyss[images/00023.jpg](photo by S. Hartley) "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 27 - The Brotherhood Forms The semester I spent with Deborah, the fall of 1970, was one of the happiesttimes of my life. Even though my mother was dying, even though there wereauguries of the peculiar events that would overtake us a few months later, itwas a wonderful, emotionally rich time. Even now I look back on it withfondness, despite the pain I’d experience as a consequence of loving Deborahover the next seven years. But that lay in the future. At the time, our littleapartment was a blissful refuge. Deborah was not emotionally complex; she reallyloved me, in a simple way, and I loved her back. I enjoyed introducing her tobooks and ideas. She was not an intellectual, had never really been exposed toany intellectual stimulation, though I discovered she was far from stupid. Itreated her well, and I felt a responsibility to protect her, to keep hersafe—and to keep her runaway status hidden.Since then I have wondered about the ethics of what I did. I was motivated bycompassion and love for her and, yes, probably some possessiveness. I was goodto her, and she was good to me. For both of us, perhaps, our relationship was asexual awakening. Deborah loved sex in a way that I have rarely encountered, andI was only too happy to oblige. She was “always up for it,” she told me, and weenthusiastically practiced, as often as we could manage. At that age, one seemsto have endless time and energy for sex; how much that has diminished as I haveaged is a bit depressing, but I suppose that is the natural order of things.Besides making love, Deborah and I really enjoyed tripping together. There wassome good mescaline around (which was probably really MDA), and what on thestreet was called “woodrose acid” though I don’t know if it was actuallyextracted from Hawaiian baby woodrose or if this was marketing hype. Whatever itwas, it was excellent, and we took it a few times. And real Hawaiian babywoodrose seeds were also available, through floral shops in Hawaii. We didn’tknow the proper dosage, and one sunny Saturday we each took about twenty-fiveseeds and headed up Boulder Canyon toward Nederland for what proved to beanother psychedelic misadventure.Hawaiian baby woodrose, Argyreia nervosa, contains lysergic acid derivatives,some of which have vasoconstrictive effects not unlike the toxic ergotalkaloids. The prudent dose is actually six to ten seeds, and no more thantwelve, so we’d taken about twice that. We were soon having cardiovascularsymptoms, difficulties breathing and what felt like a racing pulse. On top ofthat we were fully loaded, and the physical effects were making me paranoid aswell as fearful. We walked into town and went into a bar, where we tried callingHans to pick us up, but he was out. People were giving us funny looks, or so wethought. I was fairly sure we were maintaining our cool, but it was impossibleto know. Worried that someone would call the cops, we headed for the highway andcaught a ride as soon as we put our thumbs out. The nice folks shared a jointwith us in their car, and we made it safely home.I’d later try Hawaiian woodrose seeds on several occasions, at more reasonabledoses. Doses of eight to ten ground seeds produced a smooth, long-lasting,psychedelic high, not unlike about 100 mikes of acid. At that dose nausea ismild and transient, and there are no cardiovascular effects. Surprisingly,there’s no record that the seeds were ever used traditionally as a psychedelic.There are eleven species of Argyreia native to India, and presumably they areall similarly high in alkaloids, but there is no record of their shamanic orrecreational use in India’s cultures. In light of its effects, this particularpsychedelic appears to be somewhat problematic, which probably explains why ithas not become popular. The seeds can be legally obtained, but there are saferand more satisfying natural psychedelics out there.While Deborah and I were enjoying our domestic bliss, I continued to takecourses in anthropology as well as botany and plant physiology. Terence, stillon the run in Asia, had wrapped up his butterfly hunting in Indonesia and was inTokyo teaching English. We were corresponding more and had begun planning ourtrip to South America in search of the Secret. What the Secret was, however, weweren’t yet fully sure; the outlines of our quest emerged gradually. We knew ithad something to do with DMT. The mystery of DMT became the siren song beckoningus to the Amazon. As I’ve described, the DMT experience is overwhelming and yetephemeral, lasting only ten to fifteen minutes when smoked. We thought that ifwe could somehow remain in that “place” a little longer, we’d better understandwhat was going on. If we could find an orally active form of DMT that might beabsorbed and eliminated more slowly, perhaps the high could be extended.The role of certain DMT-containing admixture plants in giving ayahuasca itspsychedelic kick was just beginning to be understood, thanks to papers by AraDerMarderosian and others (1968) as well as Homer Pinkley (1969). Then westumbled on a 1969 paper by the ethnobotanist R. E. Schultes in the HarvardBotanical Museum Leaflets entitled “Virola as an Orally AdministeredHallucinogen,” an account of his work in the lower Colombian Amazonas among theBora and Witoto tribes. Both peoples used a most interesting preparation knownamong the Witoto as oo-koo-hé. It was prepared from the sap of various speciesof the genus Virola, which belong to the nutmeg family. Reports on thecomposition of this sap in the phytochemical literature revealed that manyspecies contained high levels of DMT and the related compound, 5-Methoxy-DMT;both were known to be powerful hallucinogens. The sap was used as a snuff byseveral other tribes in the Amazon, but the oral preparations were restricted tothe few tribes whose ancestral home was in the Colombian Putumayo region, nearthe mission town of La Chorrera, on a tributary of the Putumayo, the Río IgaraParaná. According to Schultes, the effects manifested rapidly and were strongand bizarre. Oo-koo-hé had to be the Secret!There were intimations in the paper that the Witoto used the substance to seeand speak with the “little people.” Could these be the same cartoonish elvesthat we had encountered smoking synthetic DMT? This was our most solid lead yet;we determined we had to go to La Chorrera and find oo-koo-hé. That exoticpreparation took on the aspect of the Holy Grail, the coveted aspiration thatany obsessive quest needs to justify the effort and sacrifice.That fall, a harbinger of what awaited me at La Chorrera arrived in a few puffsof acrid smoke. I had a small amount of DMT I broke out one night, askingDeborah to handle and light the pipe, which is how we did it, one at a time, sothe person getting high didn’t have to deal with the pipe, which is quitedifficult when you’re deep in the state. After I’d prepared the pipe, Deborahheld it to my lips, and I took three or four enormous breaths in quicksuccession. With that my mind exploded with the force of the primordial BigBang! This was the strongest DMT experience I’d ever had; I was literallysmeared over the entire span of cosmic space-time. I felt like the edges of mymind had expanded to the boundaries of the universe; in fact, there was nodifference, the universe and I were one. I had smoked in our apartment, but Ihad to get outside; I could not contain the energy. I leapt to my feet and raceddownstairs into the cool autumn night. I must have presented quite a spectacleas I twirled around on the front lawn, gazing up at the starry heavens andhowling with ecstasy! I had to be told about that part; I was unaware of doingso at the time. I was exalted, babbling, weeping, still fully in the grips ofcosmic oneness. Gradually the effect faded, and I pulled myself together andclimbed the stairs. But fragmented memories of the experience lingered with mefor days as I struggled to make sense of what had happened.By this time, late September, Terence and I had made plans to meet in Vancouver.Terence was sick of Tokyo, sick of the high-density urban environment, and morethan sick of teaching English. He’d saved enough to pay for a ticket back toNorth America. Still an international fugitive, he had luckily met a fellowtraveler in Tokyo who was able to furnish him with a false Australian passport.This document allowed him to return to Canada relatively free of scrutiny,though he didn’t yet dare use it to try penetrating the belly of the beastitself. Canada was close enough. The fact that a love interest of Terence’s,Dhyanna, had planned to be in Vancouver about that time was an added incentivefor him. They had last seen each other months earlier in Bali, before Terenceset out on his last expedition into the outer Indonesian archipelago.I arrived at the Vancouver airport about a day after Terence had flown in fromTokyo. His bogus passport worked quite well, but things didn’t go quite sosmoothly for me. The Canadian customs officers were kind, but not disposed tolet me in. They assumed I was trying to avoid the draft like so many of mycontemporaries. I had very little money and no real connections in Vancouver.They weren’t buying my story that I was there to meet my brother, and keptasking: “Why can’t he come to the States to see you? Is he a draft dodger, too?”I couldn’t exactly tell them he was an international drug smuggler wanted onfour continents. Instead, I stammered out some story about how he had fled thecountry to avoid the draft, and had found his way to Tokyo because he needed toearn some money—which was at least partly true.I had the Vancouver phone number of the friend of the helpful Australian who hadarranged the false passport for Terence. By prearrangement we had agreed thatTerence would go to this person’s house and await my call so we could hook upsomewhere once I’d cleared the border. The customs officials made repeated callsto the number, but no one there seemed to know of any traveler arriving fromTokyo; Terence was nowhere to be found. About the time they were getting readyto put me on a plane back to the States, someone called and said that, yes,apparently someone had arrived from Tokyo as there was a suitcase in the fronthall with a Tokyo tag on it. Apparently that was good enough; the officialsagreed to let me enter for a few days. Like most Canadians during the VietnamWar, they were probably sympathetic at heart to draft dodgers. I don’t know ifthey ever really bought my story, but it didn’t matter.Terence by this time had secured lodging in one of the sleaziest hotels inVancouver’s Gastown District, where I finally tracked him down. Today Gastown isa very chichi area of nightclubs and fancy restaurants; back then it was whereyou went if you were an alcoholic living on welfare, a heroin addict, orotherwise down on your luck. Terence didn’t have a lot of money, but I think hisstandards had seriously eroded during his months of travel in the junglebackwaters. Our room stank of vomit, and the floor seethed with thousands ofcockroaches; waves of them would vanish back into the nooks and corners with adry clicking sound when the lights were turned on. I didn’t relish the prospectof staying in such a place, but Terence seemed unperturbed. Besides, we had somehash; and we both agreed, with hash we could put up with anything.It was our first face-to-face meeting since we had said goodbye in Snowmass inthe waning summer of 1968; there was a lot of catching up to do. In the interim,I had graduated from high school and relocated to Aspen, the bust had gone down,Mom had gotten cancer, and we were caught up in plans for our trip to SouthAmerica. The small amount of hash we had was quickly consumed, and we neededmore. We walked from Gastown across the Burrard Bridge into Kitsilano, abeachfront community that was the nearest thing to an open-air drug market I’veever seen. Every few houses, someone was sitting on the stoop hawking hashish,cannabis, and a smorgasbord of psychedelics, calling out like carnival barkersas we strolled by. It didn’t take long to renew our supply, and we returned tothe hotel.The guy who had arranged Terence’s false passport had connections into a wholescene in Vancouver, a communal household inhabited by a colorful bunch offreaks. None of these people appeared to have jobs. They were creative types,and their chief activities seemed to be making art, making music, and partying.The pubs in Gastown made the latter easy. By law, no food was served, but aglass of beer cost twenty cents, so for two or three bucks you could drink allnight and get thoroughly hammered, which we did.After a few nights of that I was ready to leave. The customs people had made itclear that I should only stay a few days, and my time was growing short.Besides, I missed my Deborah, who was alone back in Boulder, and I had to getback for my classes. Dhyanna had surfaced about the same time, and Terence,clearly in a lustful frenzy, could hardly wait to get her alone and tear herclothes off. From the looks of her, I didn’t blame him.In any case, our plans had been set. I had brought many of the key references onoo-koo-hé and other hallucinogens we might encounter, including psilocybinmushrooms and Banisteriopsis caapi, the vine used in ayahuasca. These went intoan accordion file of reprints we intended to take on our journey. After poringover the documents, our mission became clear that La Chorrera was indeed to beour destination, and oo-koo-hé our goal. I mentioned earlier how the authorWilliam Burroughs had made virtually the same journey in 1953 in search ofayahuasca, or yagé, as it is known in the Putumayo. Burroughs had coined it “thefinal fix.” We admired Burrough’s work and saw his account of that trip in TheYage Letters as both a call to adventure and an augury of our own success. If ajunkie could travel to the Amazon to find yagé and survive to tell the tale,surely we could do no worse. Failure was not a part of what we understood to beour destiny. It was in that filthy Vancouver hotel room that we first coined thename of our visionary band, known thereafter as the Brotherhood of the ScreamingAbyss. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 28 - Our Mother’s Death Over the weeks of early autumn, our mother’s condition steadily deteriorated.All her chemotherapy and radiation treatments had led her inevitably to thatdepressing threshold when the doctors say, “There’s nothing more we can do.” Weall knew that was coming, even our father, who hadn’t wanted to admit that theend was near.The message arrived on a gray and drizzly day in late October, delivered to mydoor by a fellow CU student from Paonia. I didn’t have a telephone at the time,so her parents asked her to pass on the word that my mother was sinking fast. Itwas time to get to St. Mary’s Hospital in Grand Junction. I’d been expectingsomething like this, but it is one thing to expect and another to hear. Iremember staring out the rain-streaked window. “Everything is dying,” I said toDeborah, “Mother will be dead soon.” There was little she could say to comfortme as I gathered my things and left for the airport.By the time I landed in Grand Junction, where my father met me, it was lateevening, around nine or ten. We went directly to the hospital and were usheredto Mother’s bedside. The lights had been turned down; in the shadows I couldbarely make out her tiny form huddled under the covers. I was appalled to seehow shrunken she had become since I had said goodbye to her in Paonia beforereturning to Boulder. There is nothing pretty or uplifting or in any wayinspiring about a death from cancer; it ravages the body, and eventually rendersthe victim into a hollow husk. This it had done to Mom, my beautiful mother, theprettiest girl in all of Paonia. When I approached the bed, she opened her eyes;she had been sleeping or dozing, it wasn’t clear which. She could not speak; shewas too far into an opiate fog to do that. I covered her withered, shrunkenhands and kissed her gently on the brow, whispered something meaningless to lether know I was there. I don’t know if she was even conscious enough to know Iwas there; she made a whimpering sound but no wordscame out. I was crying; Itried through my tears to tell her that I loved her, and that I was sorry forall the ways I had hurt her.She managed to say something like “humph” or “oomph.” I don’t know what itmeant. It sounded to my ears, and in my grief, like a rejection of what I hadexpressed to her. It was too late now, too late to fix those wrongs. I wasovercome by grief, and guilt, I begged for her forgiveness; but all that cameback was “humph” or “oomph.” I broke down, all efforts to hold back the tearswere abandoned, and I had to be led out of the room. That was the last time Isaw her. By this time it was late. I was tired from the trip, and Dad took meback to the hotel room that he had rented a few blocks from the hospital. Hesuggested I try to get some sleep; he was going back to the hospital to be withMom, and would come and get me in a few hours. I could not fall asleep. Imagesfrom childhood, images of Mom and the times we had shared kept appearing behindmy closed eyelids. Finally I must have fallen into a troubled sleep, for thenext thing I knew Dad was shaking me awake, saying, “Mother’s gone.” And so shewas, and so she has been, gone for more than forty years. The day dawned. It wasOctober 25, 1970. It was bad enough for us to endure the tragedy of Mom’s death at the young ageof fifty-seven, but our grieving was complicated by another drama. While Mom wason her deathbed, Terence was keeping vigil, in close touch via telephone fromVictoria, British Columbia, where he had relocated after my visit a few weeksearlier. He was prepared to risk crossing the border on his false passport inorder to reach her bedside, and by the time Mom passed he’d already begun thefirst leg of his trip and was airborne somewhere between Vancouver and LosAngeles. Dad feared the law was tracking Terence and would pounce on him themoment he got off the plane in Grand Junction. Now that Mom had passed, therewas no point for him to complete the journey; we needed to get word to him toabort the trip and return to Canada.Back then, before the cell-phone era, this was a considerable challenge. Whatfollowed was a series of frantic long-distance calls, first to the airline inVancouver, who confirmed that he had boarded the plane and would have a layoverin L.A. before he flew on to Salt Lake City and then Grand Junction. If possiblewe needed to get word to him on one of his stops and tell him to turn around. Wesucceeded in contacting the airline literally as the plane was pushing back fromthe gate in L.A. Our message was clear: “Do not let him leave on that plane!”Remarkably, they complied, directed the plane back to the gate and let Terencedisembark. Even more remarkably, they didn’t ask many questions. In those days,security was almost laughably lax. Today, not only would the airline haverefused to divulge any information about a passenger; the mere fact that we wereinquiring would have focused attention on Terence, blowing his cover and turningthings very ugly, indeed.In retrospect, I think my father’s paranoia about Terence getting caught wasoverblown. In the overall scheme of things, he was small potatoes; yes, he was afugitive, yes, Interpol probably had him listed somewhere, but I doubt they hadthe time or resources, or even the interest, in following him that closely. Thewhole drama that played out just after our mother passed may have been moreabout taking our father’s mind off that fact than about warning Terence. Still,I have to credit Dad; even in his hour of deepest grief he still cared enoughabout Terence, despite their differences, to take extraordinary steps to protecthim.The four or five days following Mom’s death were a blur. We packed up andchecked out of the hotel and headed back to Paonia. “Some doors you never wantto open again,” my father said as we left the hotel room. It was true; this wasthe end of a long and sad chapter in our lives. At least Mom was no longersuffering. It was a cold comfort.The funeral was held at the Catholic church in Paonia. Relatives came from nearand far for the funeral, including my Aunt Amelia, my father’s sister, who drovefrom Denver, where she was a pastoral counselor at St. Joseph’s Hospital. Manyin the community loved my mother, and her funeral was well attended. She haddone much for the town’s elderly and sick, checking on shut-ins and widows,simply because it was the right thing to do. Now her friends and those to whomshe had been kind came to pay their respects. Only Terence was missing. It was atime of great sadness and grieving for me. I was depressed and felt helpless atthe loss. I was nineteen, a little more than a month shy of my twentiethbirthday, but I didn’t feel like a young adult. I felt like a child who had losthis mother, which is what I was. I was utterly bereft.After Mom had been lowered into her final resting place, I returned to Boulder,driven back by Amelia and her companion, a nun who had accompanied her toPaonia. More drama! I was petrified that they would stop and come up to theapartment and discover Deborah there. Until then, I’d kept Deborah’s presence inmy life a secret. On the way back, I placed an urgent phone call to Hans andNancy in their apartment downstairs from ours, asking them to keep Deborah intheir place until I arrived, which they did. In the end, Amelia let me off infront of the house and didn’t come upstairs. I have to wonder if perhaps sheknew what was going on and didn’t want to make a scene. We were all exhaustedfrom the stressful days just past and tired from the trip over the mountains, soshe may have just wanted to get home.I remember little about the remainder of the semester. I was depressed and sad,and Deborah’s simple and undemanding affection did little to lift my spirits.Terence was still in Victoria, and our plans to go to South America remained ontrack. His recent love interest had by then moved on, but he’d been joined byhis friend Vanessa, a fellow student in the Tussman program whom I mentionedearlier, and “Dave,” a “gay meditator” from upstate New York, as Terencecharacterizes him in True Hallucinations. Dave had been living on the margins inBerkeley when Terence met him one day while both were hitchhiking. He arrived inVictoria with a newly minted degree in anthropology from Syracuse University.The three of them had rented a clapboard house in a quiet neighborhood and hadsettled in to plan the expedition. They had shared a mescaline trip a couple ofweeks after our mother had died that Terence described as “full of elf-chatter.”Swept by intimations of the adventure ahead, Dave and Vanessa were almost asmuch in thrall to the notion of our quest as we were. The brotherhood nownumbered four.It was a time of rapid change for all of us. With Mother gone, I felt I had noreason to remain in school. Terence and I had been discussing the ideas thatwere behind our quest for well over a year. John Parker’s visit to Boulder theprevious fall had only fanned the flames of curiosity. If ever there was goingto be a time to set out in search of the Secret, it seemed, that time was now.Somehow, we convinced our father that it would be OK for me to go off withTerence to the Colombian jungle on what we presented as a butterfly and plantcollecting expedition. Even today, I have no idea why he let me go, given thatTerence had proven such a loose cannon, but for some reason he did. My fatheralso agreed to continue sending me the small stipend I’d been getting while inschool; this would be mailed to me monthly in care of the American Embassy inBogotá. He was either incredibly trusting and open-minded or so depressed byMom’s death that he no longer cared what I did. In some ways, I think he wasalso a little jealous. As a youth, my father, craving adventure, had been toosickly to act on his dreams. Then the war started, and his combat experienceshad afforded him more adventure than he’d ever bargained for. After that hebecame much more cautious in life, but perhaps his regret over missedopportunities, and a certain nostalgia for how things might have been, stilltugged at him. I think he understood, on some level, that this was my chance; Iwas due for my rite of passage, and this was going to be it. I was grateful tobe setting off on this adventure with his blessing.There was still the matter of what to do with Deborah. We were still very muchin love. I did not want our relationship to end, but clearly she couldn’t comewith me. She was still a runaway, and our situation was very shaky. We haddiscussed this several times over that autumn, and finally I convinced her thatshe should return home and get back in school. For her to remain on the lam,loose on the streets even a place as civilized as Boulder, was not a viableoption. She had been lucky to meet someone who had taken her in and protectedher. There was no guarantee that whomever she met next would treat her as well.I swore that I loved her, that I would wait for her to finish school and that wewould get back together; but for now, going home was the best thing for her, andfor me.I sincerely meant it all; I did love her. But I also felt I had no choice but topursue the adventure that beckoned. Finally, with some help, I persuaded Deborahto call her older brother. Without disclosing much, she told him where she wasand that she wanted to return. Her brother agreed to drive out and get her. Whenhe and his wife finally arrived, the meeting proved unexpectedly pleasant. Theywere decent folks; her brother was simply grateful to have his little sisterback, and happy to see she’d been well cared for rather than exploited or forcedinto prostitution. They gave no hints of being angry with me. They could see,for one thing, that our affection for each other was real.And I did care about her. I was sure we’d get back together once she hadfinished school. As it turned out, that did not come to pass, and in the yearsthat followed I paid a steep price for loving Deborah. When we finally badefarewell on that snowy day in December my heart was bleeding.Christmas that year was a cheerless affair. Dad and I were both still grievingover Mom’s death, and the last place we wanted to be at Christmas was in Paonia.We ended up going to spend the holiday with Tru and Iris, Dad’s old war buddyand his wife, in Lancaster, California—the couple who had taken Terence in forhis last year of high school. They suggested that I take the bus to Disneylandfor an overnight trip. I immediately agreed, but Disneyland was the last thingon my mind. I saw it as an opportunity to go visit Deborah, by then resettled inher hometown. I managed to time the bus trip just right to spend a few hourswith her and make it back on schedule so no one in Lancaster was the wiser aboutwhere I’d actually been.The trip gave me a chance to meet Deborah’s parents, which was necessary if Iwas serious about my commitment to her. Like her brother, they, too, weresurprisingly friendly, almost more so than Deborah herself. She wasn’tunfriendly, exactly, but I think she’d had time to reflect on her adventures andwas sobered by them. The cracks in our relationship were already forming, whichI sensed but didn’t want to admit to myself. As things turned out, I would havebeen far better off had I realized that and moved on. But the Secret lay ahead,and I didn’t spend much time mulling over the uneasiness I felt after the two ofus parted. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 29 - A Narrow Passage: 1971 [images/00025.jpg]> John Brown, Puerto Leguizamo, 1971. (Photo by S. Hartley) Shortly after the new year dawned, I returned to Boulder and stayed with Hansand Nancy for a few days. They had plans to visit Lexington, Kentucky, so I wentalong for the ride, saving myself a few bucks on airfare. By then Terence andthe others were already waiting for me in Bogotá. My journey began in earnestwhen I said goodbye to my friends at the airport in Lexington and boarded aplane for Miami.In Miami, I caught a connecting flight on Aeropesca Colombia, a cheap if notexactly safe airline that was later pulled from the skies. “Fish Air” lived upto its name by shuttling fish between Barranquilla, Colombia and Florida. Onreturn flights, Aeropesca offered passage to a few, like me, who were poor ordesperate enough to risk it. The ticket to Barranquilla and on to Bogotá costsixty dollars. The plane was a four-engine prop job, a Viscount 745D. There wereno amenities; the seats were made of aluminum, cushions not included, and theinterior smelled of rotten fish. Filthy water sloshed back and forth over thefloor, and I don’t have to tell you no pretzels were offered. I think we cruisedabout a thousand feet above the Caribbean most of the way; at least the moonlitwaves beneath me looked awfully close.After disembarking in Bogotá after that hellish and freezing flight, I took acab to the little pension in the city where I was to rendezvous with mycompanions. It wasn’t hard to tell which room was theirs; the smell of cannabisin the corridor gave me a pretty good clue. Colombia had just legalizedpossession of small amounts of weed for “personal consumption,” their conceptionof which turned out to be quite liberal. It was OK to possess nearly a kilo, andTerence and company had already stocked up on potent Santa Marta Gold,anticipating it might be hard to come by in the Lower Amazonas. We might nothave brought the right equipment or enough medicines or food, but we made damnsure we had plenty of dope.At this point, the brotherhood consisted of Terence, Vanessa, Dave, and me. Aday or so after my arrival, we were joined by a fifth, the young woman known inTrue Hallucinations as “Ev.” She and her boyfriend, Solo, had met my brother andthe others on their side trip to San Augustín, a hippie destination known forits pre-Colombian ruins and sculptures. Ev and Solo belonged to a radical sectof fruitarians and dressed in white robes and white rubber boots. They eschewedany food of animal origin, and any of vegetable origin for that matter, exceptfruits that could be harvested without impact on the plant. Even at that, theyinsisted on using a wooden knife for slicing, never a metal one, lest the bladedestroy the fruit’s etheric body. This seemed a bit over the line to me in termsof hippy-dippy foolishness. To be fair, Terence had convinced the rest of us todress for the jungle in white linen, his outfit of choice while huntingbutterflies in outer Indonesia; but compared to Ev and Solo, we were hideboundrationalists. Their oddities went far beyond their eccentric dietary practices,as we later discovered. In San Augustín, Ev and Solo were in the process ofbreaking up. After they had, Ev drifted back to Bogotá and fell in with us.Terence and Vanessa had been on-again, off-again lovers over the previous fewyears, but they weren’t together at the time. When it became clear that Ev wasavailable, Terence implemented a quick seduction (in the same room where therest of us were sleeping, or trying to) and thus she became the fifth member ofthe brotherhood, and the only one who spoke much Spanish. Vanessa had no problemwith the reconfiguration as far as I could tell. I wasn’t too happy to see ourgroup expanding beyond manageable proportions, but who was I to object? I wasthe youngest and in some sense the one most along for the ride. Besides, I couldsee that having someone along who could speak the language would be an asset. Evseemed pleasant enough, so, why not?Bogotá in January is cold and wet; though the city is in the tropics, its highelevation gives it, as Burroughs famously noted, “a damp chill that gets insideyou like the inner cold of junk sickness.” Fortunately, we were only there a fewdays. The hostel we’d been staying in was unheated and literally a fleabag; wehad all collected our share of bites and welcomed the chance to move to Ev’sapartment after her liaison began with Terence. We were there only a couple ofnights and then departed for Florencia, the capital city of Colombia’sdepartment of Caquetá.There we encountered a rather unpleasant surprise. When Dave, ouranthropologist, had met Solo in San Augustín, he’d been much impressed with theguy’s purported knowledge of the forest. Dave later cabled him, inviting him tojoin us in Florencia for our expedition down the Río Putumayo, and Solo, itseemed, had accepted. This was problematic. That Terence and Ev had coupled upwas news to Solo; he thought his former partner had gone to Peru. Nevertheless,he insisted he ought to accompany us, arguing that he was a man of the forestand that we wouldn’t find oo-koo-hé without him. Finally, Terence gave in. Therewas an unspoken tension between them from the start, but for a while, at least,an uneasy truce reigned. Solo was a screwball; he believed he’d been, at varioustimes, the reincarnation of Hitler, Christ, and Lucifer, and that various famouspersonages inhabited the animals that traveled with him: his kitten, his monkey,and his dog. These creatures were vegetarians like Solo and hence appearedtwisted and unhealthy, like Solo, whose teeth were rotting and who looked quiteundernourished. Solo communicated with entities he called the Beings of Light,and even the most trivial decision could not be made without consulting withthem; their decrees were expected to be obeyed not only by Solo but by everyoneelse in our party. It was pretty clear that this situation would becomeuntenable in the very near future.But for now the brotherhood was six, and after a short stay we moved on toPuerto Leguizamo, the jumping-off point for boats heading down the Putumayotoward Leticia and points east. The grim river town turned out to be singularlylacking in amenities or any kind of charm. Burroughs observed that the “placelooks like it was left over from a receding flood” when he passed through in1953, and apparently little had changed since then.Puerto Leguizamo is memorable in this tale for two things. One was an Americanwho had lived there for many years, John Brown, a black man and the son of aslave. He was ninety-three, he said, but he must have been older, and he hadseen it all. He had left the United States in 1885, never to return. He’dtraveled the Caribbean, eventually joining the merchant marine, visiting portsaround the world before reaching Iquitos, Peru in about 1910. The Amazonianrubber boom and the atrocities inflicted on the indigenous people in the questfor “white gold” were then in full swing. As demand for latex grew in theoutside world, Indians were forced into slave labor, driven to collect thesubstance from the forest, among other tasks, under the whips and guns ofruthless foremen. Thousands were raped, tortured, and murdered in a campaign ofmass terror that decimated the area’s tribes.John Brown found work with a company run by the notorious rubber baron JulioCésar Arana. Some implicated Brown in atrocities that were committed in Arana’sname, but according to an early account of that era written by Walter Hardenburgin 1913, Brown may have helped to expose those misdeeds. He cooperated with aRoyal High Commission investigation organized by the Irish statesman andhuman-rights crusader Roger Casement, who as British counsel in Rio de Janeirohad traveled to Peru to document the violence. [images/00029.jpg]> Route map to La Chorrera. (Map by M. Odegard) Brown visited La Chorrera for the first time in 1915. He told us about hisexperience there with ayahuasca, which he called yagé. Shortly after he’d takenit alone in the forest, a little man stepped out onto the trail in front of himand said, “I am yagé. If you come into the forest with me I will teach youeverything there is to know.” Brown said he declined the invitation, but I hadto wonder. In any case, though stooped with age he cut a most impressive figure.We were awed and intimidated. This man had witnessed and participated in so muchof the turmoil that had marked the decades near the turn of the twentiethcentury. Under his ancient gaze, we felt like children, which we were; theoldest among us was twenty-four.Puerto Leguizamo is also memorable as the site of our first encounter withPsilocybe cubensis, the psilocybin-containing mushroom that within a few weekswould replace oo-koo-hé as the central focus on our quest. During our stop inFlorencia, Terence had found and consumed a single large specimen, but the restof us weren’t so lucky. We had better luck in the pastures around PuertoLeguizamo. Though it hadn’t rained for some days, we found enough specimens toallow everyone to give it a try. Since we had nothing better to do, we collecteda few of the beautiful carpophores and repaired to our casita at the primitivehostel where we were staying. Except for Terence’s low-dose bioassay inFlorencia, none of us had ever taken mushrooms before; we identified them fromthe references we had brought. Back in Berkeley and Boulder, psilocybin and“magic mushrooms” were the stuff of legend but impossible to acquire through ournetworks. Magic mushrooms are now widely cultivated and relatively easy to find;many people are familiar with their effects. That was not the case when we tookthem at Puerto Leguizamo. We didn’t know what to expect.We were pleasantly surprised. Psilocybin seemed a lot less “serious” than LSD,whose trip seemed more weighted with personal psychology and psychoanalyticalbaggage. Psilocybin had its own personality—an elfin, mischievous character. Itstimulated laughter and plastered silly grins on our faces. With eyes open,colors were enhanced and there was an almost tactile, silken quality to the air.Closing my eyes resulted in seemingly effortless evocations of the mostbeautiful, coruscating visions, rich in violet and blue overtones, hard-edged,three-dimensional, and yet somehow organic and sensuous. Along with the visualeffects were effects on cognition and language. Puns came easily; ourconversation was threaded with merriment and cleverness, all spilling outspontaneously, with no apparent effort. At times it seemed that the mushroomsopened up a direct pipeline to the Logos itself, the bedrock of meaning thatunderlies all language, indeed, all of human cognition and understanding. Attimes you could almost see it, like an effervescent foam of meaning bubbling upthrough the interface between understanding and apprehension, a mercuriallubricant between what Henry Munn, writing in 1973, termed “the contact of theintention of articulation with the matter of experience.”Yes, mushrooms made us laugh and we couldn’t stop smiling; but at a moreprofound level they seemed to enable us to gaze into the fabric of realityitself. They were easy on the body, no nausea or stomach cramps. And they werefun! The experience was non-threatening in every way. We had found the perfectrecreational psychedelic. We had thought we had come in search of bigger fishthan this, a misconception of which we would soon be disabused. But for now, themushrooms would do. They would definitely do!It was only a couple of days after this experience that we finally securedpassage on the next leg of our journey. The Fabiolita was a barge that plied thePutumayo, hawking tinned meats and fluorescent gaseosas, or soft drinks, to thetiny villages dotted up and down the river between Puerto Leguizamo and Leticia.For a few pesos, we were invited to make ourselves comfortable on top of thecases of gaseosas that were stacked up in the center of the flat-bottomed bargeand covered with a tarp. The crew furnished no spare tarps to protect us fromthe blazing Amazonian sun, but fortunately we’d brought our own and were able toset up a makeshift shade cloth.We departed Puerto Leguizamo on a Saturday, February 6, 1971. One day before ourdeparture, Apollo 14 had landed on the moon after its launch on January 31. Thiswas only the third Apollo mission to reach the lunar surface; the previousmission, Apollo 13, had been aborted following an oxygen tank explosion in theservice module on the outbound leg and barely made it back. Apollo 14 hadrelatively few problems and hence attracted less attention; a jaded public wasalready getting bored with the space program despite being perhaps humanity’sgreatest adventure. Apollo 14 is mostly remembered for the two golf balls thatAlan Shepard hit with a makeshift club he’d brought with him. It was also themission on which astronaut Edgar Mitchell had his famous “savikalpa samadhi”experience, or mystic glimpse beyond the self into the true nature of things.Mitchell subsequently became interested in consciousness research, paranormalphenomena such as ESP, and went on to become a founder of the Institute ofNoetic Sciences (IONS). To the distress of NASA, he also became a publicadvocate for UFO investigations, insisting the evidence for the extraterrestrialorigin of UFOs was very strong despite efforts by a few covert figures insidethe U.S. government to cover it up. I’d like to think Mitchell was tapping intosome of the same strange vibes that had begun transmitting to us. He may havedamaged his reputation, but I admire his honesty.Whatever the public response, we were acutely aware of the mission throughscattered news reports as we made our way into the Colombian Amazonas. We feltan affinity for the astronauts on their journey into the unknown. Driftingdownriver, we, too, were impelled by the call of a mystery we felt to be no lessworthy of pursuit. The weather was clear during most of our journey; occasionalafternoon showers yielded to spectacular sunsets; and by the time the moonappeared in all its fullness the skies were crystal clear. One night, gazing upat the full moon, knowing our fellow humans were gazing down on us, we noticedsomething odd. There appeared to be a black mark, or a large shadow, on themoon, and nothing more; but what was it? We speculated that it might be theresidue of a science experiment; perhaps the astronauts were dispersing carbonblack over the lunar surface to measure albedo or some such thing. Ourconjecture was absurd, though we did learn later that one of the mission’sobjectives had been to crash the Saturn IVB booster into the moon and measurethe resulting seismic activity. But that impact could not possibly have beenobservable from Earth, especially without a telescope. Whatever its source, thesmudge was there, at least on one night. We all saw it. It was never mentioned,let alone explained, as far as we knew; I chalk it up to the ingression of onemore peculiarity into the “real world” during our adventure. The farther wepenetrated into the jungle, the more permeable became the boundary betweenordinary reality and that of dreams.Our destination after leaving Puerto Leguizamo was the mission of San Rafael atthe mouth of the Río Cara Paraná. We were looking for “Dr. Alfredo Guzman,” asTerence called this figure in True Hallucinations. Guzman was a Colombiananthropologist working with the Witoto, together with his English wife andfellow anthropologist, “Annelise.” It was Guzman who had originally informedSchultes about the orally active oo-koo-hé preparation, so we figured he mightgive us some leads. From San Rafael, it was only a short trip via canoe to thevillage of El Encanto, the embarkation point for the trail to La Chorrera. Thetrail had been cleared in the early twentieth century to transport harvestedrubber from La Chorrera to San Rafael for transport downriver on barges; tens ofthousands had given their lives to build it. We had chosen the overland routebecause the alternative, to continue down the Putumayo to the next tributary,the Río Igara Paraná, and then take that to La Chorrera hundreds of kilometersupstream, would have added several weeks to our journey. Cutting across to theIgara Paraná, which roughly paralleled the Cara Paraná, would reduce our traveltime to four days.We didn’t encounter Guzman and his wife at San Rafael, but the padre assured uswe would surely find them at El Encanto, where he’d recently moved to be closerto the Witotos. We lost no time in continuing on to El Encanto, a village whosename meant “the enchantment” or “the haunted,” evoking what felt like anothersynchronicity between the real world and our inner ideations.There was no way to notify Guzman of our impending arrival, and he seemedunhappily surprised when we showed up. His wife, however, was more open to ourcompany. Living among the Witotos meant her status had to be commensurate withthe village’s other women. As custom dictated, she’d been living communally withthem while Guzman dwelt in his own hut. The arrangement seemed quiteexploitative to us, and hardly egalitarian, but who were we to judge? As for ourcolorful band, I can imagine Guzman’s dismay when we showed up in our whitelinens, long hair, beards, bells, and beads, accompanied by Solo’s menagerie ofsickly dogs, cats, monkeys, and birds. We could have stepped into his scenedirectly off the streets of Haight Ashbury. Nevertheless, he pointed us towardan empty hut where we could hang our hammocks before moving on, which heobviously hoped would be sooner rather than later.Sensing the tension, we told him what we had come for and assured him we’d bepressing on to La Chorrera as soon as possible. Guzman was not forthcoming whenwe enquired about oo-koo-hé. He seemed quite surprised that we even knew thisword, and bluntly stated that to go to La Chorrera and start asking around aboutoo-koo-hé would be an inexcusable breach of protocol. It was a secret, he said,known only to the most powerful shamans and not supposed to be known to the restof the tribe, let alone to a bunch of freaks from California. We did not pressthe matter.Guzman’s agitation clearly went beyond his annoyance at us for disrupting hisfieldwork. He seemed edgy and hyper-vigilant, clearly in some kind of state. Hishabit of chewing copious amounts of coca had apparently triggered something likean amphetamine psychosis that had rendered him extremely paranoid. He carriedhis machete with him at all times and would wander about, cutting swaths throughthe grass and muttering things like, “The snakes, the snakes are everywhere,waiting to strike! You must never let down your guard,” and on and on, his eyesburning with the intensity of an Old Testament prophet. There were no snakes, atleast none that we could see. The man was clearly troubled, and possibly worse.It was also clear that his shy and chubby wife was aware of the situation andconcerned, possibly terrified, but we weren’t about to intervene in theirstrained relationship. We made plans to move on as quickly as we could, whichmeant rounding up porters to carry our stuff. It’s not as if we needed moremotivation to move on, but we got it anyway when a large palm tree next to ourhut “spontaneously” caught fire in the middle of our second night there. WhetherGuzman had put someone up to that or others resented our presence, we took it asanother sign our short welcome had worn thin.Fortunately, we quickly found a couple of Witoto lads of about seventeen to helpus. They were short and stocky and went about barefoot, which is actually thebest way to go in the Amazon if you have the thick layer of callouses on yourfeet that these kids had. They were taciturn and spoke almost no Spanish. Beingtenderfoot gringos, we were equipped with state-of-the-art backpacks, all nylon,padded straps, aluminum frames that rested on the hips, really very nice. OurWitoto bearers rejected them. They took their machetes into the forest andreturned ten minutes later with some leaves, strips of bark, and fibers from aliana, and quickly fashioned them into loosely woven baskets with shoulderstraps. They dumped our high-tech packs into these baskets, and the trek began.Theirs was actually the superior technology. I tried on one of the baskets, andit was as comfortable as my North Face version. Like tourists everywhere, we hadseriously over-packed. We tried to consolidate our gear into two large packsthat the bearers could carry, along with three smaller packs that we could tradeoff among us; the rest we stuffed into a trunk we’d brought—I don’t know what wewere thinking—and asked Guzman to store it for us until we returned. Hereluctantly agreed, no doubt just to get us out of there.After a day of preparations we started down the trail, or troche, in the earlydawn mist. We’d been told the journey would take four days, with crude sheltersspaced about a day’s walk apart. Our goal was to reach the shelters in time tomake camp before darkness fell. We must have presented quite a spectacle as wedeparted the village, disappearing down the trail in our white linens and robes,Terence leading the way with his butterfly net fully deployed, and our bemusedporters bringing up the rear. They soon got well ahead of us when we stopped torest. It was the morning of February 18, 1971.Looking back, I marvel that we even survived the ensuing trek, which washellish. Every morning we rose before dawn, made coffee, shared a large spliff,and set out. Much of the Amazon is very flat, but in this area there were manysmall rivers and shallow ravines, most of which were bridged by crude logbridges. These consisted of nothing more than a large tree felled over the gap,covered with moss, and slippery as could be, like much of the trail. We wereslipping and sliding through slick mud for much of the way, down one ravine, upto the next ridge, then down again in a monotonous pattern.I’ve always feared heights, and every time we came to a bridge I was terrifiedI’d slip off into the ravine below—not a great distance but enough to do seriousdamage. My eyes became fixed on the ground to avoid tripping on roots orslipping. We smoked constantly, partly because Terence did so as a rule and sawno reason not to on the trail. The cannabis may have helped us put up with theconditions, but I also think it exhausted us, or compounded our exhaustion. Thejungle was not particularly hot during those long afternoons; the canopyoverhead protected us from the bright sun, and it was often misty and gloomyunder the immense trees. During our frequent rests, I sometimes took off myshirt and hung it on a branch to air it out; it would soon be covered with adense mass of stingless bees apparently attracted to the sweat. During thosebreaks, the vast silence of the forest, broken by the occasional bird or insecttrill, pressed in on us from all sides. The place felt haunted by its history. Ithought of the Indians who had met a horrible fate there, the cruelties they hadendured in pushing that trail through thick forest.It was the second day, I recall, when things finally came to a head betweenTerence and Solo. The tension between them had been palpable and growing eversince we had departed from Puerto Leguizamo. Solo said little, but his eyesblazed with a glittering fury. He clearly hated Terence for stealing hisgirlfriend, as he saw it. Solo was growing nuttier by the day. He was also inextreme pain from his rotting teeth and multiple abscesses. He needed to getback to civilization and have them treated. What’s more, there was only room forone alpha male in this particular troupe of monkeys, and it wasn’t going to behim. Inevitably, there was a confrontation. An embarrassing standoff on thetrail took place, eventually defused when Vanessa intervened. We continued ourslog down the trail in sullen silence. Later, Solo declared that he had decided(perhaps after consulting the Beings of Light) to return to El Encanto and headback upriver. We all mumbled he was probably right, in view of his medicalsituation. The face-saving out enabled him to depart somewhat gracefully. Westopped for the night, and by dawn he’d slipped away.We passed two more exhausting days on the trail. The women had stopped cooking;there was no way to make a fire with the damp wood. We were reduced to tins ofsardines and smoked meat. Our energies were flagging but it didn’t matter. Asthough hypnotized, we pressed on. We were young and in decent shape but notparticularly athletic or trained for a wilderness ordeal. Somehow we managed. Onthe afternoon of the fourth day, right on schedule, we transitioned from thedeep gloom of the primary jungle into sparser secondary forest and then emergedinto a rough clearing. We could see the mission buildings situated on the farside. A rainbow had accompanied us for the last few kilometers of our journey,and it seemed an appropriate and encouraging omen. We had traversed the narrowpassage to La Chorrera. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 30 - On the Edge of the Abyss In some respects, everything in life before we arrived at La Chorrera was aprelude to the events that engulfed us there; and everything afterward has beena reflection of them. Terence chronicled the events in True Hallucinations.Though his account may seem unlikely and bizarre, I believe it is largelyaccurate, even if interpretations vary as to what it all meant. I can’t vouchfor every detail, if only because I was lost in hyperspace for much of the time,or overwhelmed by psychosis, again depending on interpretation. Anyone with aninterest in the “facts” of our story, if the word even applies, should regardTerence’s narrative as required reading.As for my narrative, I’m faced with three tasks in the next few chapters. Thefirst is to tell the story of what happened over those weeks. Second, I want todescribe my experience while I was away in hyperspace, or, if you prefer,disengaged from consensus reality; this is a part of the story only I can tell.My third task is to step back and attempt a more analytical deconstruction,beginning with the first of many philosophical questions: What the hell wasgoing on?Mission La Chorrera consisted of a small church with a wooden bell tower, thepadre’s residence, a police outpost near the dock on the river, and a cluster ofbuildings that included classrooms and a few other simple structures. At the endof our trek, we were exhausted and grateful for the chance to hang our hammocksand recover in an empty hut. After a few days, however, the teachers who usuallylived there arrived with the bush pilot on his monthly mail drop, and werelocated. The padre, a Capuchin priest by the name of Father José Maria(another coincidence in that he had the same initials as our father, JoeMcKenna), let us stay temporarily near the mission in a hut on stilts we quicklydubbed the “knoll house.” A number of Witoto families had recently arrived topick up their children from the mission school at the end of its academic year.In a few days, the padre told us, the families would depart and there would benumerous empty dwellings to choose from. We had our eyes on another raised hutset off in the forest, but until that opened we were quite happy where we were.The knoll house stood on a rise perhaps 200 yards away from the mission butstill in the pasture, a large area cleared from the forest to accommodate a herdof humped zebu cattle. The riverbank was about 100 yards from the knoll. Theimpressive geological formation that gave the place its name was called thechorro, the Spanish word for a stream or gush. It was something like a waterfallbut shallower, the remnant of a primordial volcanic event that had ruptured theunderlying bedrock, forming a circular chasm. The Igara Paraná formed a roaringcataract at this point, and below that a small lake. This formation marked theend of the navigable portion of the river, so La Chorrera was the end of theline in more ways than one.The combination of pastures, cattle, and frequent warm rains had created anideal habitat for Psilocybe cubensis, the same mushroom species we’d encounteredearlier in Florencia and Puerto Leguizamo. These mushrooms are known to bepan-tropical; they occur in both hemispheres, in any place with a warm climatewhere cattle are raised; in fact, they can be considered symbionts of thecattle, whose dung provides a rich substrate for them. Psilocybe cubensis, thenclassified as Stropharia cubensis, are the most widespread and common of thetropical psilocybin mushrooms. We found them growing everywhere in the pasturesaround the knoll house and beyond. There were big, beautiful clusters ofcarpophores sprouting out of nearly every cowpat, quite impossible to ignore. Wemust have arrived at the peak of the season; earlier in our trip we’d onlyspotted a few specimens. Needless to say, we were delighted at this unexpectedgood fortune.By then, Terence and Ev had canoed to a Witoto village upriver and returned withthe plant materials for home-brewing some ayahuasca. We still believed theobject of our quest, the real mystery, to be oo-koo-hé. But mindful of Guzman’scautions, we made discreet inquiries about that while otherwise amusingourselves with the mushrooms. The specimens were succulent and quite delicious,their slight bitterness easy to overlook in light of our scant food supplies.We’d brought rice, beans, and tinned meats, wrongly assuming we’d be able topurchase other foods along the way. We could buy fruit, eggs, and yuca, ormanioc root, from the locals, and condensed milk and noodles from the tinytienda at the mission, but our diet was spare and boring. We found that a fewmushrooms added to boiled rice or an omelet provided just the thing to perk upan evening’s meal; and the best thing was that the after-dinner entertainmentwas built in. We had not yet understood that the mushrooms were the real Secret.We regarded them much too casually as mere recreation. As a result we found itvery easy to eat them daily, either as part of the meal or as a midafternoonsnack, with no immediate adverse effects. They were an excellent complement tothe cannabis, which we smoked constantly, along with the occasional hit derivedfrom shavings taken from our fresh supply of Banisteriopsis caapi, the vineadded to ayahuasca as a source of MAO-inhibiting compounds. We found thatsmoking the bark while on mushrooms synergized the closed-eye hallucinations ina most pleasant and intriguing way. We dubbed this serendipitous discovery“vegetable television.”It didn’t take too many days of such behavior for events to evolve in somefairly peculiar directions. As anyone with experience will tell you, themushrooms stimulate conversation, and they give one “funny ideas” that seem tobe quite novel, even hilarious. Being constantly on a low dose of mushrooms gavenew verbal agility to an already very verbal bunch. Our conversations, full ofnon sequiturs and amusing puns, flowed freely, much as they had during our firsttrips at Puerto Leguizamo. The difference was that we more or less remained inthis noetic space all the time. It was as if our group of five had been joinedby an extremely erudite, clever, and delightful guest who had come for dinnerand decided to stay.Although we were enthralled by this verbal levity, our exchanges eventually tookon a more serious character. Terence recounted the story of a DMT trip he’dshared with an English girl on the rooftops of Kathmandu a year earlier when allhell had broken loose. They ended up locked in an erotic embrace thattranscended normal lovemaking; their bodies, seeming to fuse, began exuding aviolet, effervescent fluid that evoked a transformation akin to insectmetamorphosis. His improbable tale didn’t seem all that far-fetched in thebe-mushroomed ambience of our little hut.Another idea came up, one tied to a 1968 article by the anthropologist MichaelHarner in Natural History magazine. According to Harner, the Shuar people ofEcuador (also known as the Jivaro) regarded the ayahuasca dimension as the realworld and many regularly drank the brew as a way of accessing it. Curiously,upon entering that world they were often greeted by the “sound of rushing water”in their heads. The better practitioners knew this to be the realm where theirmagical abilities could be manifested. One such skill was the ability toregurgitate a “brilliant substance” containing “magical darts” that could beused either to cure illness or to induce it.As I’d later learn, the concept of a magical substance produced from the bodywas an element of ayahuasca shamanism throughout the upper Amazon. In theMestizo ayahuasca tradition, this material was referred to as “phlegm,” asubstance in which virotes—the magical darts—are suspended. This amounted to akind of psychic technology that, like all technology, could be used for bothgood and evil purposes, depending on the practitioner. A more obscure legend hadit that these magical fluids could be vomited and smeared into a kind of screenakin to a scrying mirror or crystal ball. Master practitioners could gaze intothe film and envision the future, see distant places, spot game, and diagnoseillnesses, among other feats.The point was that this shamanic phlegm and the “violet psychofluid” thatTerence and his consort exuded in Katmandu seemed similar. In the alchemical andmagical traditions, these objects can be solid like crystal balls; but they canalso take liquid form, as in water or mercury. The unifying concept was thatthese things were actually a blend of both matter and mind. They weresubstances, to be sure, but ones in which the future and distant places could beseen, in which anything imaginable, even language itself, literally becamevisible.Someone unfamiliar with such chatter would have regarded these ideas asextremely odd if not plain crazy. But as I’ve described, Terence and I werealready steeped in an exotic conceptual stew comprising alchemy, Jungianpsychology, ceremonial magic, shamanism, yoga, and science fiction. To somedegree, that was also true of our companions. Besides, our analytical categorieswere pretty loose to begin with; we were anything but rigorous reductionists,even if we might have kidded ourselves that we were scientists.So to us, these ideas weren’t that strange. Could the body really produce asubstance that was a fusion of matter and mind, and that containedmetalinguistic idea-complexes that can only be comprehended in a state ofprofound tryptamine intoxication? We had no problem with that; in fact, in ourstate, that concept made perfect sense. And whatever powers the mushrooms mayhave given us in the service of great conversation, reductionist rigor andskepticism weren’t among them.On the contrary, the mushrooms encouraged the wildest intellectual fantasies, asif egging us on to ever more outlandish scenarios. We heatedly discussed theparallels between alchemical fluids and crystals and shamanic phlegm. We alsoexplored the role played by sound in evoking these phenomena. Anyone who hassmoked DMT can testify that sounds heard inside the head are a prominent part ofthe experience. Sometimes the sounds are like ripping cellophane, sometimes theyare more like electrical sounds, buzzing, popping, and humming noises. Notuncommonly, similar sounds are often heard on high doses of mushrooms. AsTerence noted, DMT seems to trigger glossolalia and other forms of spontaneousvocalization. Once the interior sound is perceived, there is an impulse toimitate it with the voice, to sing along with it. The sound doesn’t lend itselfwell to imitation, but if one tries, the voice eventually seems to lock on tothe inner buzz, which then pours out of one’s mouth in a long, powerfulululation that is quite alarming and unlike any sound one would ordinarilyutter. And making the sound is cathartic. It triggers an almost orgasmicecstasy, and it greatly stimulates the closed-eyelids visual phenomena. There isa precedent for this in the traditions of ayahuasca shamanism as well. Theicaros, the healing songs sung by ayahuasqueros, are used to evoke the innervisions and thereby direct the inner journey. There is apparently a tight linkbetween the icaros and the inner visions, and the manifestation of these fluidpsycho-substances.Our conversations revolved around these heady ideas night after night as wecommuned with our new companion. And by then we did have a sense of being in thepresence of an “other,” an entity of some kind that was fully participating inthe conversation, though in a nonverbal or perhaps metalinguistic way. We cameto think of this other as “the Teacher,” though it was unclear whether thatmeant the mushrooms themselves, or if the mushrooms provided a channel forcommunicating with some unidentified entity.Whatever it was, the Teacher was full of interesting suggestions about how ourinvestigations should proceed. We began to think pure Logos had taken physicalform, that is, manifested itself as a substance composed of mind, of language,of meaning itself, yet all somehow grounded in a biological substrate. We usedthe term “translinguistic matter” to describe this mysterious substance, and wespeculated that somehow it was produced in the peculiar state created byingesting tryptamines. We figured this matter was psilocybin or DMT that hadbeen “rotated” through the fourth dimension so that its “trip” was on theoutside of the molecule. The more we kicked around these concepts, the moreexcited we became.Now, the reader may wonder what we meant by fourth-dimensionally “rotated”psilocybin, or a trip being on the “outside” of a tryptamine molecule. These arestrange ideas, indeed. An analogy might help me explain them. Consider a pieceof sheet music made up of printed notes on a page. The notes are an abstract wayof denoting sounds of a particular pitch and duration, played in a particularsequence. The sheet music is a representation of the music, in effect aschematic diagram of the music, but not music per se. The music manifests itselfwhen the notes are played in a process unfolding through time—the fourthdimension.We can extend this notion to the idea of a molecule like psilocybin or DMT beingfour-dimensional. The inert molecule, in a bottle on a shelf, is something likethe 3-D score of the molecule’s 4-D potential. Only when that mundanecrystalline substance is combined with a complex mammalian nervous system doesthe pharmacokinetic symphony—the trip—unfold. The body in this analogy is theinstrument that plays the trip, by metabolizing the molecule.On our seventh night at La Chorrera, the idea of my body being an instrumentbecame all too real after I’d taken nineteen mushrooms, my largest dose yet. AsTerence put it, I suddenly stiffened and “gave forth, for a few seconds, a verymachine-like, loud, dry buzz” accompanied by what I felt to be an intensewelling of energy. In many ways, this was the moment when the weirdness leapt toanother level. According to Terence, after my outburst he proceeded to tell hisKathmandu tale as a way to “calm us all.” The subsequent talk of psychofluidsand so forth may have been calming to some, but not to me. The next morning,February 28, marked the start of my furious writing as I tried to capture theknowledge I’d apparently been chosen to transcribe.In retrospect, I see how our conceits embodied a paradox of the psychedelicexperience. As noted above, on one level we understood that a molecule doesn’t“contain” the trip. Rather, the trip is an interaction between a living organismand a molecule’s pharmacological properties. These properties may be inherent tothe drug, but the trip itself is not. That explains why a drug manifestsdifferently in different organisms, and even differently in the same organism atdifferent times.We got that, sort of. But in our delusion, if that’s what it was, we alsoembraced a conflicting view: We believed an intelligent entity resided in thedrug, or at least somehow communicated to us through it. Even as we theorizedabout the 4-D expression of the drug—that the trip could somehow be expressed onits exterior by rotation through the fourth dimension—we were assuming onanother level that a being of some sort was directing the trip.We weren’t the first or the last to make that “mistake.” After all, this is veryclose to shamanistic views of the psychedelic experience, in which the drugspeaks through a skilled practitioner. Though psychedelics have been widespreadfor decades, people still have a natural tendency to describe their experiencesas though the trip were in the drug: “The LSD gave me wonderful visions,” theymight say, or “Ayahuasca showed me,” or “The mushrooms told me.” I’m keenlyaware how seductive this assumption is, and how easily I slip into it myself, ifonly as a figure of speech. And yet as a scientist I must say no: Thesesubstances did none of those things. The human mind-brain created theseexperiences. At La Chorrera, the psilocybin somehow triggered metabolicprocesses that caused a part of our brains to be experienced not as part of theself, but as the “other”—a separate, intelligent entity that seemed to bedownloading a great many peculiar ideas into our consciousness.That’s the reductionist perspective. Is it true? I honestly can’t say, eventoday. It either is true, or the alternative is true, that there actually areentities in “hyperspace” that can communicate with us via something akin totelepathy when the human brain is affected by large amounts of tryptamine.That’s a hypothesis worthy of testing, if such an experiment could ever bedevised.But at La Chorrera, we couldn’t be bothered with such nuances. Believing themushroom, or the Teacher, to be urging us on, we conjured up our theory aboutwhat was happening and then resolved to test it. Our “experiment” was not toprove if the Teacher existed. We took that for granted. We wanted to see if whatthe Teacher was teaching us would really deliver.I should clarify that by “we” I don’t mean our entire party. Life in the shadowof the little mission had taken some interesting turns. Vanessa and Dave hadmoved out of the knoll house to a hut nearer the river. Meanwhile, on March 2,Terence, Ev, and I had moved farther away, down the trail to the forest hut,which by then had opened. The split, while friendly, suggested a philosophicdivide. Some of us wanted to run with the ideas we were entertaining, and somedid not. I should add that the ideas “we” were entertaining were largely mine,as the next chapter will reveal. Dave and Vanessa were clinging to thereductionist view for all they were worth; the weirdness around us could all beexplained, they said, in familiar, psychological terms. The rest of us weresuiting up for a plunge into another dimension.We decided our experiment would occur on the evening of March 4. Terence spentmuch of March 3 gathering dried roots and sticks from the area around our newhut. On the appointed morning, he used that to build a large fire and boil upsome ayahuasca from the plants he’d brought back from the Witoto village. I hadit on the Teacher’s authority that the beta-carbolines in ayahuasca, present asharmine, might be the special seasoning we needed to make the recipe work, a keycomponent in whatever it was we were concocting. Years later, in his account,Terence would question whether his brew had really been strong enough to“provoke an unambiguous intoxication.” His theory was that the MAO-inhibitingeffect of harmine might have potentiated the psilocybin we still had in oursystems from the large doses of mushrooms we’d already taken. It’s worth notingthat we hadn’t ingested any mushrooms for a couple of days preceding theexperiment. Whatever the reason, the abyss had opened, and we were going in. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 31 - The Experiment at La Chorrera Whether the ideas that seized us over those days were telepathically transmittedby the mushroom, or by a mantis-like entity on the bridge of a starship ingeosynchronous orbit above the Amazon (which we considered), or created withinour own minds, I’ll never know. I do know that our lively discussions led us tospeculate about how the phenomenon might be assessed. I should clarify that. Bythen, the Teacher had suggested the outlines of an experiment to me.Or I believed so anyway, in my state of hypermania. Wildly stimulated by theconcepts at play, I felt I was downloading explicit instructions from theTeacher, the mushroom, or whatever it was, about our next steps. The goal wasn’tsimply to test the hypothesis but to fabricate an actual object within thealchemical crucible of my body. This thing would be a fusion of mind and mattercreated by the fourth-dimensional rotation of the metabolizing psilocybin andits exteriorization, or “freezing,” into a physical object. Such an object wouldbe the ultimate artifact. It would be the philosopher’s stone, or the UFOspace-time machine, or the resurrection body—all these things beingconceptualizations of the same thing. The Teacher was downloading the blueprintsfor building a hyper-dimensional vehicle out of the 4-D transformation of my ownDNA interlaced with the DNA of a mushroom. But not just blueprints alone. I wasalso getting step-by-step instructions on how to build this transcendentalobject.The basic idea revolved around our discussions about the violet psychofluid, themagical phlegm, and the scrying goo, for lack of a better term. Alchemicalsymbolism furnished the conceptual framework within which these notions made akind of sense. The creation of the philosopher’s stone, in alchemical parlance,involves a multi-step chemical reaction. The metaphors of chemistry are appliedto transformative operations on the psyche and spirit of the alchemist. Theprocess is not unlike a chemical synthesis that results in a final product; Jungwould say that final product is the individuated self. We were postulatingsomething more literal and much stranger.Among the many stages in the alchemical synthesis, one essential step is calledthe “fixing” of the mercury. In this case, mercury symbolizes an inherentlyvolatile, highly reactive substance: mind itself. The volatile substance createdin the alchemist’s alembic is literally “mercurial,” thus making quicksilver aparticularly apt analog for mind. The fixing of the mercury is the penultimatestep in the alchemical reaction, the step in which the mercury is trapped, insome way tamed in a process that is analogous to crystallization. The completedstone would be my own mind, rendered visible and trapped within a 3-D container,like a Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a magnetic bottle.To put that another way, what the Teacher had transmitted was a set ofprocedures for creating, and then fixing, the mercury of my own consciousness,fused with the four-dimensionally transformed psilocybin-DNA complex of a livingmushroom.“What?” the reader may ask. “What does that mean?” I might ask the same questionnow, but at the time it was perfectly clear.Bear with me here as I introduce another concept. As the “experiment” becameclear to me, I understood that the sounds that could be heard on DMT or onmushrooms at high doses were caused by the “electron spin resonance” of thetryptamines metabolizing in the nervous system. Electron spin resonance (ESR),sometimes called electron paramagnetic resonance, is a phenomenon displayed bycertain substances that have one or more unpaired electrons. To study thebehavior of unpaired electrons, researchers apply an external magnetic field tothe electrons and then measure the changes in their “spin quantum numbers” and“magnetic moment.” This technique, known as ESR spectroscopy, resembles the morewidely used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, in which the spin states ofatomic nuclei, rather than electrons, are measured. The ESR “signal” isgenerated by measuring the difference between the low-and high-energy electronswhen microwaves of varying frequencies are applied in a magnetic field ofconstant strength. The signal can provide information about the energetics ofthe spin states of the unpaired electrons. The signal’s output is the microwavefrequency that generates the “splitting” of the spin states. It is not an audiosignal, but it can be expressed as an audio signal, as can any electromagneticsignal if it is channeled through an audio generator.What I have written above is pretty much all I know about ESR. I didn’tunderstand the physics or the math behind ESR then, and I don’t understand itnow. Nevertheless, the Teacher plainly presented this information as the basisof the “experiment” I was to devise. The ESR signal, it said, would be generatedby a molecular complex formed between the DNA in the membranes of my neurons andthe metabolizing psilocybin and harmine intercalating—that is, insertingitself—between the base pairs of my neuronal DNA. And here’s where the ayahuascafigures into the recipe, as my source of harmine.Four decades on, we now know that the receptors for psilocybin in the neuronalmembranes are proteins, a serotonin receptor classified as a 5-HT2A subtype. In1971, however, almost nothing was known about the molecular nature ofneurotransmitter receptors; some people even speculated that transmitters mightbe short sequences of ribonucleic acids localized in the membrane (Smythies1969). At the time, we believed the newly formed harmine-psilocybin-DNA complexwould generate an audible ESR signal. What’s more, the Teacher explained that bylistening for the audible ESR signal on a high dose of mushrooms, one couldimitate this sound and thereby cancel out these harmonic frequencies, bringingabout a chemical reaction that would cause the complex to drop into a stable,superconducting state.Meanwhile, the harmine that had melded with my DNA would amplify its ESR signaland generate a stable standing waveform—essentially a hologram. And the hologramwould begin to broadcast the information stored in the DNA, making that databoth comprehensible to thought and open to manipulation by thought. If theexperiment worked, one of us in the near vicinity would be turned into a DNAradio transmitting the collective knowledge of all earthly life, all the time.Got that? One thing was certain. I was making creative use of the lesson insympathetic resonance my high-school band director had shown me on the stringsof my stand-up bass. Here is an excerpt from the (now barely legible) notes Iscribbled madly just hours before the experiment: > The Opus can now be summarized briefly:> 1. The mushroom must be heard.> 2. The yagé must be charged with the overtonal ESR of the tryptamine via an> amplified sound.> 3. The [illegible] ESR resonance of the tryptamines in the mushroom will be> cancelled, and it will drop into [a] superconducting state: the physical> matter of the mushroom will be obliterated.> 4. The superconductively charged psilocybin will pick up the ESR harmonic of> the yagé complex: This energy will be instantly and completely absorbed by the> 4-D tryptamine template. It will be transferred into the mushroom as a sound> and condensed onto the tryptamines as a bonded complex of superconductive> harmine-tryptamine-DNA.> 5. The result will be a material object of fourth-dimensional superconductive> matter, that receives and sends messages transmitted by thought, that stores> and retrieves information in DNA holographic storage, and that depends on> superconductive harmine as a transducer energy source, and superconductive RNA> as a temporal matrix.> It is now possible to reconstruct the physical-chemical idea metaphor that we> have evolved in the process of understanding this phenomenon, i.e., the> fourth-dimensional rotation of matter…. It can be explained thus: The> tryptamine complex that occurs in the mushroom acts as an antenna for picking> up and amplifying the harmonic ESR tones of all tryptophan-derived compounds> of all living organisms within its range; since the tryptamine undergoing> metabolism is superconductive, this means that its range of reception is> theoretically infinite, and the antenna does, to some extent, pick up a signal> whose ultimate origin is the totality of living creatures; but since the> tryptamine metabolism is carried on within the brain (or mushroom) at a very> low voltage level, the antenna behaves as though it were limited, even though> it is superconductive. It seems clear therefore that the signal, which in this> mushroom and in this ecologically dense area can be discerned so clearly,> originates in the ESR resonation of the yagé plant, though perhaps all of the> biosphere is picked up and broadcast amplified via the yagé superconductive> transducer. This understanding will clarify precisely what will occur at the> moment of 4-D warp. Ingesting the yagé harmine will speed up the process of> metabolization enough to amplify its ESR tone to an audible level; this ESR> tone will harmonically cancel out the ESR tone of the tryptamines within the> mushroom, causing it to lose its electric field and snap into a> superconducting configuration. The yagé ESR will have keyed the mushroom> tryptamines into a superconducting antenna; it is then ready to have the> tryptamine-harmine-DNA-RNA compound being metabolized within the body> condensed onto its charged template matrix. A microsecond after the mushroom> tryptamine has been superconductivity charged, its amplified ESR wave will> then cancel out the ESR signals of the tryptamines and beta-carbolines> metabolizing in the body, as well as the genetic material. This will cause> these compounds to drop into superconducting configuration and bond together,> at the exact same time that they bond to the waiting mushroom template. This> transfer of superconductive compounds charged within the body to a> superconductive template prepared within the mushroom will not occur in 3-D> space; no actual physical transfer will be visible, as the organically> processed superconductive material will bond itself to the mushroom template> through the fourth dimension. The result will be the work of works, that> wonder which cannot be told: 4 dimensions captured and delineated in 3-D> space. The Stone will be all things, but the elements which, superconductively> charged, bind together in the fourth dimension to form it are among the most> common natural products, and the function and place of each in the Stone can> be understood. The Stone is a solid-state hyper-dimensional circuit that is> quadripartite in structure: 1. Tryptamines, first charged in the mushroom to> act as a grid-template on which the rest of the circuit is condensed. In the> final Stone the tryptamines act as a superconductive antenna to pick up on all> cosmic energy in space and time. 2. The superconductively charged harmine> complex within the Stone itself will act as its transmitter and energy source.> It is interesting to note that the same energy that sustains the antenna> circuits in superconductivity will sustain the whole of the device: that> energy will be the totality of cosmic energy turned upon itself through the> fourth dimension. 3. The third component of the Stone is the DNA bonded to and> resonating through the harmine. It will constitute the 4-D holographic memory> of the device, and will contain and explicate the genetic history of all> species. It will be the collective memory of the device, and all times and> places and conceivable forms will be accessible within its matrix. 4. The> fourth part of the circuit will be the RNA, which will also be> superconductively charged. Through its function of self-replication turned> through the fourth dimension, the RNA will be able to act as a 4-D, waveform> holographic image, and give physical form instantly to any idea. It will> perform the same function it has always had in an organism, the process of> replication through time. But this time, replication will be subject to the> whim of consciousness. Of course a molecule which breaks itself apart and> produces two duplicates of itself has to be functionally without electrical> fields and hence is of course superconducting.> > Does any of that make sense? It clearly isn’t a carefully defined protocol for ascientific experiment. The words may sound like scientific jargon, but they arenonsense. It’s more of an incantation than anything else, a recitation ofcharged words and phrases intended to evoke a certain state of mind.Nevertheless, this was the information that was downloaded to me by the Teacher,a recipe for constructing a hyper-dimensional artifact that would bind fourdimensions into three and thereby end history. An object made of mushrooms,bark, and my own DNA, welded together using the sound of my voice. The Teacherwas blunt: “If you do this procedure, it will happen.” Build it, and they willcome; more precisely, build it, and you will hold all of space-time in yourhands, in the form of the stone. The philosopher’s stone—singing to a mushroomwhile completely ripped on high doses of psilocybin boosted with harmine fromthe ayahuasca—will make manifest the most miraculous object imaginable. Mind andmatter will fuse into a hyper-dimensional object that is the ultimate artifactat the end of time, whose very creation brings an end to time, leading humanityto a state in which all places and all times are instantly accessible at thespeed of thought. It’s crazy stuff. It reads like the ravings of an unhingedmind, and perhaps that’s what it was. There’s more:> > There comes a time…that time has come. History will end in a few hours.

I’m acutely aware ofthat as I read those words penned so long ago in an Amazonian hut by a muchyounger Dennis who was utterly convinced he was about to collapse, or at leasttranscend, the space-time continuum. The ravings of a madman, I’ll grant that.And yet, there is also poetry here, and beauty, and a longing for redemption.What I expressed is not that different from the vision articulated by the mostcompassionate and beautiful of the world’s religions: the universe will notachieve perfection until all beings have achieved enlightenment. Isn’t that whatI’m saying? No doubt there is messianic delusion here; indeed, in passages a bitfurther on in that text I discuss my role as cosmic Antichrist. But there isalso a deep wish for healing, not only of myself but of the universe. Our motherhad been dead less than six months. I have to believe that much of what happenedto us at La Chorrera was linked to that tragic event. So overwhelmed were we bythe sense of loss, and of guilt, we were ready to tear space and time apart inorder to reverse that cosmic injustice. On the evening of March 4, Dave and Vanessa joined us for dinner at the forestretreat, but they wanted no part in our looming adventure. The sudden approachof a violent thunderstorm brought us all outside to stare agog at a massive,flickering cloud; then the wind and rain hit, and Vanessa slipped on the wetladder as she hurried back into our raised hut, hurting her ankle. After thestorm passed and Dave and Vanessa had departed, Terence, Ev, and I completed theexperiment’s final preparations, as dictated earlier by the Teacher. We knew oursuccess was assured, thanks to the strange signs we were given as the momentneared, from the intense lightning to the apparent breach of physical law,including the eerie steadiness of a tilted candle’s flame, our only light. Thesephenomena (or so we told ourselves) were caused by the shockwave of thecontinuum-destabilizing events, now just hours ahead, as it rippled back intothe past like a kind of temporal echo. We were approaching the singularity. Weknew we were going to succeed because, just a few hours ahead, we already had.By then, we’d taken the ayahuasca off the fire and set it aside, along with somebark shavings from the Banisteriopsis vine we’d used to make it. We planned todrink a small cup of the brew when we ate the mushrooms and, if necessary, smokethe bark to activate and synergize the psilocybin. Earlier, we’d gone to thepasture and located a beautiful specimen of Psilocybe cubensis and carried itback, intact and metabolizing on its cow-pie substrate. We had also collectedseveral perfect specimens we’d eat to initiate the experiment. Though we hadn’ttaken any for a couple of days, the mushroom “ESR” signal had been more or lessaudible to me ever since our last major session when I’d created the loudbuzzing sound for the first time.On the floor of the hut we drew a circle marked with the four cardinal points,and placed drawings of I Ching hexagrams at each one, to define and purify thesacred space where the work was to occur. Inside the circle, we placed themushroom we’d chosen as our receiving template, along with the ayahuasca and thebark shavings. We suspended the chrysalis of a blue morpho butterfly near thecircle so the metabolizing tryptamine from that source would be present. Whythat of all things? We were attempting a kind of metamorphosis, and so clearlywe needed a chrysalis close by. Kneeling together in the circle, each of usdrank a small cup of the bitter brew, still slightly warm from its preparation.I munched two mushrooms, and we climbed into our hammocks to wait.By then we were fully in the grip of the archetypal forces we’d activated. Wewere no longer in profane time or profane space; we were at the primordialmoment, the first (and the last) moment of creation. We had moved ourselves tothe center of the cosmos, that singularity point at which, as the Hermeticphilosophers put it, “What is here is everywhere; what is not here is nowhere.”We were not in control any longer, if we ever had been. We were acting out ourroles in an archetypal drama.Though we were motionless, cocooned in hammocks in a hut in the Amazon, it feltas though we were approaching the edge of an event horizon. We could clearlyperceive time dilating as we neared the moment of “hypercarbolation,” our termfor the act of sonically triggering the 4-D transformation of the blendedpsilocybin and beta-carboline. Time was slowing down, becoming viscous asmolasses as we fought against the temporal gale howling down from the future. “Aseries of discrete energy levels must be broken through in order to bond thisthing,” I said. “It is part mythology, part psychology, part applied physics.Who knows? We will make three attempts before we break out of the experimentalmode.Who knew, indeed? We were following a script, but no longer a script we’dwritten. I ate one more mushroom and settled back into my hammock, wrapped in myponcho-like ruana. It didn’t take long before the mushroom’s energy begancoursing through my body. I could hear the internal ESR tone getting stronger inmy head; it had been easy to evoke, never far from perception for the lastseveral days. I was ready to make the first attempt to charge the mushroomtemplate.I’ll let Terence take it from there: > Dennis then sat up in his hammock. I put out the candle, and he sounded his> first howl of hypercarbolation. It was mechanical and loud, like a bull> roarer, and it ended with a convulsive spasm that traveled throughout his body> and landed him out of his hammock and onto the floor.> We lit the candle again only long enough to determine that everyone wanted to> continue, and we agreed that Dennis’s next attempt should be made from a> sitting position on the floor of the hut. This was done. Again a long,> whirring yodel ensued, strange and unexpectedly mechanical each time it> sounded.> I suggested a break before the third attempt, but Dennis was quite agitated> and eager to “bring it through,” as he put it. We settled in for the third> yell, and when it came it was like the others but lasted much longer and> became much louder. Like an electric siren wailing over the still, jungle> night, it went on and on, and when it finally died away, that too was like the> dying away of a siren. Then, in the absolute darkness of our Amazon hut, there> was silence, the silence of the transition from one world to another, the> silence of the Ginnunga gap, that pivotal, yawning hesitation between one> world age and the next of Norse mythology.> In that gap came the sound of the cock crowing at the mission. Three times his> call came, clear but from afar, seeming to confirm us as actors on a stage,> part of a dramatic contrivance. Dennis had said that if the experiment were> successful the mushroom would be obliterated. The low temperature phenomena> would explode the cellular material and what would be left would be a standing> wave, a violet ring of light the size of the mushroom cap. That would be the> holding mode of the lens, or the philosopher’s stone, or whatever it was. Then> someone would take command of it—whose DNA it was, they would be it. It would> be as if one had given birth to one’s own soul, one’s own DNA exteriorized as> a kind of living fluid made of language. It would be a mind that could be seen> and held in one’s hand. Indestructible. It would be a miniature universe, a> monad, a part of space and time that magically has all of space and time> condensed in it, including one’s own mind, a map of the cosmos so real that> that it somehow is the cosmos, that was the rabbit he hoped to pull out of his> hat that morning. (TH, pp. 108-109) This didn’t happen, of course. Nor did a new universe emerge from theGinnungagap, the “mighty gap” or abyss or void from which the universe emerged,according to Norse legend. The mushroom did not explode in a cloud of icecrystals as its DNA radically cooled, leaving a softly glowing, lens-shapedhologram humming a few inches above the floor of the hut. That did not happenbecause it could not happen; such an event would have violated the laws ofphysics. That didn’t bother us in the least—we were convinced we were about tooverturn the constraints of conventional physics. Besides, we’d been gettingfeedback from the future; we knew that we were going to succeed because wealready had! Yet what I had confidently predicted didn’t occur. What did?Terence again: > Dennis leaned toward the still whole mushroom standing in the raised> experiment area.> “Look!”> As I followed his gaze, he raised his arm and across the fully expanded cap of> the mushroom fell the shadow of his ruana. Clearly, but only for a moment, as> the shadow bisected the glowing mushroom cap, I saw not a mature mushroom but> a planet, the earth, lustrous and alive, blue and tan and dazzling white.> “It is our world.” Dennis’s voice was full of unfathomable emotions. I could> only nod. I did not understand, but I saw it clearly, although my vision was> only a thing of the moment.> “We have succeeded.” Dennis proclaimed. (TH, p. 109) Succeeded at what? Not what I had predicted. But clearly something had happened.For one thing, I think we’d painted ourselves into a metaphysical corner. What Ihad predicted would happen, could not happen—but we already knew that somethingwould happen, because it already had! I realize this statement suggests amisunderstanding of the nature of time, because how can something that was stillin the future have already happened? Nevertheless, this is what we understood.After the experiment, Terence was confused. I, on the other hand, thought I hadthe situation well in hand. As dawn neared, we left Ev in the hut and walked outto the pasture in silence, each lost in our own thoughts. I said something toTerence like, “Don’t be alarmed; a lot of archetypal things are going to starthappening now.” And they did. That might have been the last coherent statement Iwould utter for the next two weeks.By then I’d begun to disengage from reality, a condition that progressivelyworsened throughout the day. The reader may quip that we’d been thoroughlydisengaged for quite some time, which might have been true; but even what grip Istill had was slipping fast. As we stood in the pasture, Terence staring at mequizzically, I said, “You’re wondering if we succeeded?” What unfolded over thenext few minutes was an episode of apparent telepathy. I could “hear” in my headwhat Terence was thinking. I was answering his questions before he articulatedthem, though with or without telepathy they were easy enough to anticipate. Allof them were ways of asking, “What the hell just happened?”But there was more to it than that. I felt I’d manifested a kind of internalizedentity, an intelligence now inside me that had access to a cosmic database. Icould hear and speak to this oracular presence. I could ask it questions—and getanswers. As I explained to Terence, the oracle could be queried by prefacing thequestion with the name “Dennis.” For instance, “Dennis, what is the name of thisplant?” And the oracle would instantly respond with a scientific name. Terencesoon learned the oracle could also be addressed as “McKenna.” Something verypeculiar was going on. Whatever it was, we were both under the thrall of thesame delusion.Shortly thereafter I lost my glasses, or rather, I hurled them into the jungle,along with my clothes, in one of my bouts of ecstasy. My blurred vision for thenext few weeks surely playing into my estrangement from reality. When I tried toshare our wondrous discovery with the others, they were underwhelmed. Vanessa,our resident skeptic, asked some mathematical questions of the oracle, and itwas flummoxed, or it gave answers we couldn’t verify. Nevertheless, Terence andI were utterly convinced we had succeeded. We were sure that a wave of gnosiswas sweeping the world with the advancing dawn line; people were waking up tofind themselves, as Terence put it, “pushing off into a telepathic ocean whosename was that of its discoverer: Dennis McKenna.” "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 32 - Waiting for the Stone [images/00030.jpg]> A canoe at La Chorrera. (Photo by S. Hartley) The events at La Chorrera entered a new phase on our walk that morning in thepasture as we tried to sort out what had happened the night before. A fullaccount of the following days would consist of three intertwined narratives. Thefirst is the version told by Terence in True Hallucinations, written from theview of a participant in a delusion who nevertheless remained oriented in timeand place. The second is the one our companions might have told, had they chosento, as observers who hadn’t been caught up in our bizarre ideations. The thirdnarrative is what I alone experienced, fragmented though it is.My story began with a tremendous journey outward. To the extent that thereexisted a precedent for what happened to me, I relate it to my DMT trip inBoulder months earlier when I felt my mind had been blown literally to the edgesof the universe. Standing on the lawn that autumn night, I became one witheverything; the boundaries of my self were those of the universe. And so it wasas I progressively disengaged from reality over the first day after ourexperiment at La Chorrera. Once again I was smeared across the totality of spaceand time. Was I reliving that earlier experience, or having one like it? Thequestion makes no sense. There is only one experience like that, and it isalways the same one; it takes place in a moment that is all moments, and a placethat is all places.At any rate, I was back in that place, at that moment. And my reintegrationstarted there as well. I began to “collapse,” or perhaps “recondense” is abetter term, on what seemed roughly to be a twenty-four-hour cycle; and witheach cycle I got that much closer to reintegrating my psychic structure. By thesecond day I had shrunk to the size of the galactic mega-cluster, and by thethird day to that of the local galactic cluster. I continued to condense at thatrate down to the size of the galaxy, the solar system, the earth and all itslife, the hominid species alone, my ancestral line, and then my family. Thefinal distinction was between my brother and myself. Throughout this ordeal, Ihadn’t been sure if we were separate entities or not. Once we had separated andI was “myself” again, it wasn’t the old self I had left. Like an ancient marinerreturning home after a voyage of many years, I was changed forever. I was stillresonating with the memories of those experiences, not fully reintegrated by along shot, but I was grateful to be back in a body, back in a reality thatconformed to my expectations—more or less, and most of the time.But that took a couple of weeks. While I was lost on my shamanic journey,spiraling in closer and closer, Terence was engaged in his own reintegration, ina way that was complementary to mine. I was cruising through multiple spatialdimensions, whereas Terence was anchored in time; he was, in fact, the beacon Iwas following home. As we understood it, at the moment of hypercarbolation inour hut on March 4, we momentarily became one; then we split apart again, in away that was analogous to the separation of a positive photographic plate fromits negative image. We became temporal mirror images of each other. One of us,Terence, was moving forward in time, while I was moving backward in time, fromthe future. When both of us reached the point where past and future met, wewould become fully ourselves again, except that by then we’d have fullyintegrated the experience of the other.To our companions, what was going on must have presented itself as a classicexample of folie à deux, a delusion or psychosis shared by my brother and me.None of us had the vocabulary to describe it at the time; it was only yearslater that we learned that such phenomena are well documented in the psychiatricliterature. What happened to us was certainly a shared altered state, but toreduce it to a mere instance of shared psychosis doesn’t really do it justice. Isay that even as I know I may still be expressing a compulsion to treat it assomething other than that, something more.But as far as Vanessa and Dave were concerned, the lens of psychiatric illnesswas the one they reflexively adopted to explain our strange behavior. Because wewere acting crazy, we were crazy; and the best solution, as they saw it, was toget us out of that jungle backwater as quickly as possible and into the nearestpsychiatric facility. Considering where we were, that option was problematic.I’m grateful that circumstances did not permit it, but I am equally grateful toTerence for resisting the pressure to leave La Chorrera. He insisted thatwhatever was happening to us be allowed to unfold in its own time and on its ownterms. It was clear to him, at least, that I was slowly getting better, and thatthere was no need for intervention beyond making sure that I didn’t wander offor hurt myself. Against her better judgment, perhaps, Vanessa accepted Terence’sargument and agreed to a course of watchful waiting. Had my return beeninterrupted, I doubt that I would have ever “recovered” completely (if that’seven the appropriate word). Under the classic model of shamanic initiation, I’dbeen torn asunder, but I was able to stitch myself back together. There is notelling how things might have gone had the process been aborted.Over the next few days, we came to assume our alchemical quest had basicallysucceeded, but that some of our assumptions had been incorrect. The stone wesought to construct, the transcendental object, the lens, had not materializedin a flash. Would that it had! That would have settled the matter. Instead, oursuccess apparently presented itself as a gift for telepathy and access to a vastdatabase not unlike the akashic records, the mystical library of all human andcosmic knowledge spoken of by the Theosophists. True, our efforts to validatethat knowledge had been problematic, but our connection seemed intact. Ourshared line to the Teacher was still open, and we were kept informed, in realtime, of what was going down.We likened this at the time to “how the boar ate the cabbage,” our grandfather’sphrase for any account that could be trusted as authentic. The Teacher was quiteready to lay down how the boar ate the cabbage. It also insisted we’d gotteneverything right, but our timeframe was off. The stone had been created; butbecause it was by its very nature atemporal, it was tricky to predict just whenit would manifest. Part of our task became trying to nail down that moment of“concrescence,” that moment when the “ampersand” as we called it then, or the“eschaton” as we dubbed it later—in any case, the last event—would arrive.Indeed, Terence’s effort to predict when and where the stone would appear markedthe start of his obsessive ruminations on the nature of time, and the clues tothat riddle he believed he’d glimpsed in the I Ching. In his account, Terenceremembers the period of my “shamanic ramble” as the most intense time he’d evergone through. For the next nine days he “neither slept nor needed sleep.” Hescanned the environment constantly, hoping to catch the stone in the act ofconcrescence. Willing himself into a state of hyper-vigilance, he also watchedme constantly—probably a good thing because I had a tendency to wander away fromthe hut.Every day we’d go to the pasture, where Terence would demand that I produce thestone; I couldn’t do that, of course, but I predicted it was getting closer andcloser. He claims that one reason he made this daily demand of me was to keep mefocused on condensing myself as well, which is probably true. I now realize hisintense preoccupation with time was as much an integrative process for him as mycosmic homecoming was for me. Both were desperate attempts to get reorientedover the next two weeks; both were more or less successful. This processcontinued well beyond our departure from La Chorrera; indeed, in some respects,for me it is still ongoing.Over the next ten days, there also transpired a series of anomalous events,which Terence describes in detail. Some were tied to the odd skills I’dapparently developed, like my ability to pluck episodes out of his head though Ihad no prior knowledge of them. One example involved Terence’s story about hisfrenzied coupling in the marinade of psychofluid on that rooftop in Katmandu.Somehow, I was able to reenact the conversation he’d had with his English friendin the confusion afterward, when she pointed out that Terence had somehow endedup wearing her “knickers,” that is, her panties—an embarrassing detail he’delected to withhold from us until I repeated the entire dialog verbatim, liftedfrom his thoughts.On another occasion, I connected with a kind of cosmic telephone exchange thatenabled me to ring up anybody I wanted, alive or dead, anywhere in time. One ofthem was my dead mother, who I reached while she was listening to a radiobroadcast of the World Series in 1953. She didn’t believe it was me on the linebecause my nearly three-year-old self was sleeping in the crib beside her! Othersuch events seemed to penetrate into the “real world,” though at the time thatnotion seemed very loose indeed. We were living in a situation where the mindwas creating reality, or at least modulating reality at a time when it seemedbizarrely susceptible to the force of our imaginations. None of this surprisedus; that’s what happens when you seize control of the machinery that generatesreality. Reality becomes whatever you want it to be.What we wanted, it seemed, were unexpected electrical phenomena and rainbowswithout rain, among other quirks of nature. I’d fallen into the habit ofaddressing Terence as “ama,” the Witoto word for brother. During one of ourwalks in the pasture, I led him to a large tree, bent down, and pulled the grassback to reveal the weathered letters “A M A” carved into its base—and surelycarved years earlier from the looks of them. How had I known that word wasthere? Why was it there? I do not know.Once, when I got tired of Terence demanding that I produce the stone, I producedinstead a tiny silver key. We had been talking about that key, or one just likeit, which opened an inlaid wooden box with a secret compartment that had oncebelonged to our grandfather. Terence was keenly aware of the key’s specialimportance in our childhood as one of our earliest “alchemical analogues of thephilosopher’s stone.” It was he who challenged me to produce the key as a way toprove my new skills, so I did, placing it in his hand. He was shocked. We hadassumed the key had long since disappeared, along with the box, and to this dayI have no idea how I conjured it, or at the very least one just like it.Interestingly, while rummaging through some stored family boxes recently,untouched for decades, I stumbled on this box, but not the key. Presumably ithas disappeared back down whatever wormhole had coughed it up that day in thepasture.While Terence and I were immersed in our folie à deux, our shared reality, orwhatever it was, our companions were puzzled, if not alarmed. Terence and I werecommunicating telepathically. What was going on was certainly strange, but weunderstood each other, or so we believed, and these events made sense to us,especially once we understood they were taking place in a surreal universecreated by the Irish author James Joyce. That realization gave a context to thezany things going on; it was a pun-filled farce cooked up by James and NoraJoyce, who happened to inhabit the body of a large rooster and a small henliving near the river hut. We were in on the joke; Vanessa, Dave, and even Ev toa certain extent, were not.Four decades later, I still find it hard to put a label on what was going on. Inretrospect, the best explanation is perhaps that we somehow underwent a sharedshamanic experience that superficially resembled schizophrenia. The followingexcerpt is from “A Preliminary Report on an Experiment at La Chorrera,” apreviously unpublished account we collaborated on, with Terence narrating, inthe months after our return from La Chorrera, as we struggled to make sense ofwhat had happened. It gives some sense of how we were interpreting those eventsat the time. Note that we trace our initial break from reality to the earliesthours of February 28, when I first heard and imitated the harmonic ESR toneafter eating nineteen mushrooms: > The most difficult of the aspects of our work at La Chorrera to write about> must certainly be the psychological. Here is an area where we are called on to> exercise objectivity in discussing personalistic contents and situations.> Several themes have suggested themselves as being major motifs of an> archetypal nature that our experience caused us to experience…the major theme> is that of death and resurrection. Silverman has noted two types of> schizophrenia under the heading “reactive”; these he calls “essential” and> “paranoid,” and his descriptions of these two types correspond exactly to the> varieties of unusual ideation that were the major confirmation of our success> on the submolecular level that we received following our experiences of> February 28. From that date on, the normal configurations of both my own and> my brother’s personalities started a migration toward these two forms of> reactive schizophrenia. Dennis evinced enormous mental powers and irritability> during the six days following the twenty-eighth; during this time period my> own psychology was marked by prolonged states of deep active imagination and> “delusions of grandeur.”> In the early morning hours of March 5, shortly after the completion of the> macroexperiment, the development of both our symptoms took a quantum jump> upward. In the space of hardly more than an hour, my brother entered a> progressively more detached and cosmic state of essential schizophrenia; this> development, coupled with his assurances that this was the proof of the> measure of our success, was causing in me a growing certitude that we had> succeeded and that this success meant nothing less than the cessation of all> natural limitations in the very near future. For the next thirty-seven days,> especially the next fourteen days, my brother’s ideation consisted, among> other themes but as a dominant theme, of the idea of a shamanic journey of> return, from the ends of space and time, to the earth, with the collected> energy configuration of everything condensed into a kind of lens or saucer, a> true lapis philosophorum. He projected, and I, experiencing an intense state> of reactive paranoid schizophrenia, accepted, the role of God, or father, big> brother, or Christ, or, and especially, moral judgment. He in turn manifested> an understanding of the principles and methods of science and information> control that was truly miraculous. He saw himself at times as a giant computer> in a starship making a long journey home under the control of his brother,> garbed in the dual role of the cosmic shaman and the Adamic Christ.> From the sixth until the twentieth, neither of us slept, and Dennis raved> continuously, in telepathic rapport with anyone he wished, in command of> enormous technical erudition and of a strange and rapidly evolving> hyperspatial cosmogony. He visualized, following a Manichean perception, the> solar system as a huge light pump wherein the light of souls was pumped from> planet to planet until it finally leaves the solar system altogether and is> transmitted to the home lens at the galactic center. Some of his discoveries> included that the Saturnian moon Titan is composed of hashish which resonates> with the living mycelium of psilocybin culture, that tryptamine fish swim in> the harmine seas of Neptune, and, most important, that Jupiter is the> reflected image of Earth in hyperspace, is teeming with bizarre life forms,> and is somehow an essential key to unraveling the racial fate. Late twentieth> century history was seen by Dennis as a frantic effort to build an object> which he called “the lens” to allow life to escape to Jupiter on the heels of> an impending geomagnetic reversal. Slowly, as the shamanic voyager neared his> home, his place in space, his stitch in time, the symptoms faded in each of> us. However, the continuing process of understanding triggered by our> experiment did not cease. Rather, it continued to exponentially accelerate> with the passage of each twenty-four-hour cycle, leading us out of the> fantastic ideation of the early days following the experiment—we now> understand this ideation as the shape of things to come—and into the> understanding that has led us to the ideological model of the eschaton.

The most relevant idea> complex relative to the time cycles and emotional states which I experienced> seemed to be that of the Christos, the archetypal shaman redeemer whose> intervention into history at the end of time triggers the Apocalypse and the> Millennium.> If we correctly understand our accomplishment at La Chorrera, then we did in> fact take upon ourselves the eschatological task supposedly reserved for the> Son of Man who will come at the end of time to judge the living and the dead,> that is to say that by being the instrument by which the wave form of> understanding passes out of three dimensions and into the fourth we were able> to fulfill the literal expectations of the Apocalypse that sets Christianity> apart. For once the hypercarbolation of the genetic matrix begins, that is,> once the molecule begins to form in hyperspace, it is only a matter of time> before the mind, as Lapis, becomes visible and independent of the physical> body.

Jung> believes all of these spherical images to be reducible to the self, and> further suggests that the form of the so-called flying saucer is a similar> phenomenon. It is these two themes, the collective end of time and the> resurrection of the body that seem to have been responsible for the nearness> to the Christian worldview that was reflected in the psychological contents> with which we had to deal as a result of our own “ending of time” through the> experiment at La Chorrera. During that period just after our experiment, I spent most of my time wanderingin my own private world; my contact with anyone else’s was tangential andoccasional. That’s a crucial difference between what Terence thought I wasexperiencing and what I really was experiencing. My thoughts and deeds in what Iunderstood to be hyperspace were far more real to me than external events, eventhe anomalous ones I participated in and may have caused. But however real thoseinternal processes seemed, they are hard to reconstruct, partly because theylack sequential structure, a chronology that would lend my fragmented memoriessome coherence.That Terence retained a chronological sense of the interlude in question isanother clue to our different experiences. There were times when my rants orjust my wild gaze, absent my glasses, brought him “brief stabs of despair,” hewrites. He’d been reminded again how far away was the place from which I had toreturn. Nevertheless, he clung to his position that I was steadily gettingbetter and just needed some time. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 33 - The Bell Tower and a UFO While we were reintegrating ourselves, life continued to unfold in the realworld shared by Vanessa, Dave, and Ev. Though Ev had observed the experiment andwould witness some bizarre events after it, she hadn’t been so powerfullyaffected. As someone I’d describe as half in and half out of our reality, shebecame a kind of emissary between the camps. Several factors were slowly nudgingus toward the merger of our shamanic timeframe with theirs. Put more plainly, wewere under growing pressure to accept the consensus view that we ought toengineer our exit from La Chorrera sooner rather than later. Vanessa’s injuredankle, twisted on the log ladder into our hut, was still swollen and painful; itwas hard to imagine her retracing the long hike in. Meanwhile, our supplies wererunning low. The decisive factor arose suddenly, however, and began with me.By the morning of March 10 my reintegration had progressed well; I could carryon a conversation and was almost rational in my responses—deceptively so.Terence wrongly assumed he could briefly leave me alone at the hut while he andEv slipped away for a little Lepidoptera hunting, a field trip they extended fora little lovemaking in the semi-privacy along the trail. Leaving me untendedproved to be a mistake. No sooner had they left than I bolted from the hut andheaded for the mission’s main square, where I created a huge racket byvigorously ringing the church bell, a ritual usually reserved for calling thefaithful to Sunday mass. Terence heard the bell and came running, though by thenthe damage was done. As for me, all I remember is my desire to leave the hut andgo among the people, overwhelmed by a messianic impulse to heal. I haddiscovered the power and I was eager to use it.Until then, we’d pretty much kept to ourselves; we had little contact with themission personnel or the area’s few Witotos. There had been rumors that one ofus was a little bit off, but my spectacular performance at the bell tower turnedthat to fact, and our isolation abruptly ended. Whatever my reasons, my actionswere a serious breach of protocol, and the resulting stir wrested my care out ofTerence’s hands. Vanessa, already insistent that we get out of there, now hadthe backing of the padre and the police. Moreover, as she learned, a plane justhappened to be on the way. The others quickly decided that Dave would leave onthe plane, return to San Rafael to collect our stored supplies, and make his wayback up the Putumayo and eventually to Bogotá. No sooner had Dave collected hisgear than the plane landed on the water, he got onboard, and the plane took off,vanishing into the clouds.With Dave’s departure, our badly strained brotherhood was now four: Terence, Ev,Vanessa, and me. The others moved me from the forest house into the river house,close to the police station where I could be monitored. Vanessa and Ev took overmy care, leaving Terence alone in the other hut. A day later, word reached usthat the bush pilot had agreed to return in a few days for the rest of us, aplan Terence had little choice but to accept. None of us knew exactly when theplane would arrive. We were told to have our gear packed and be ready to leaveon a moment’s notice.The forces we’d unleashed—whether in our heads, in the external world, or inboth—remained at play. Many of the oddest and least explicable events involvingapparent eruptions of the paranormal occurred in the period between Dave’sdeparture and our extraction five days later. It was shortly after Dave had leftthat I manifested the silver key. Terence had been freed from the need to keephis sleepless watch over me, but that didn’t mean he slept. He passed hisinsomniac nights beneath the starry canopy, haunting the pasture and trails nearthe chorro, lost in reveries of time and space with the great wheel of thegalactic mandala reeling above as though in reflection of the cosmic cyclesunfolding in his waking dream. There is a fervent and beautiful vividness to hisaccount of the sweeping thoughts and visions he had in the company of “thedeeper something that shared my mind.” A reader can’t help but feel those hourshe spent alone may have been among the most fateful of his life.Shortly before sunset one evening, Ev noticed a thunderhead suddenly develop onthe southeastern horizon, roiling upward into the shape of an enormous mushroomcloud towering over the Amazonian plain. As Terence and Ev were witnessing this,Ev reminded Terence of my quip about the nuclear mushroom cloud being abiophysical pun on the transformative power of Psilocybe cubensis. The mushroomat the end of history was of fungal not thermonuclear origin, I maintained, anactual mushroom that would lead our species beyond history. As they stood andwatched that churning mass assume its immense form, a bright shaft of lightemerged out of the cloud’s base and fell on the landscape below. It could nothave been the sun because that was setting to the west and they were gazingtoward the southeastern horizon. Over the new few days, oddly turbulent clouds,shimmering patches of refracted light, and other atmospheric anomalies persistedin the southeastern sky. The Teacher, still very much in our midst, informedTerence to keep watching. His vigilance continued through yet another sleeplessnight, this one spent beside the lake; it ended on the morning of March 14 withan encounter that, in his words, “marked for me the culmination of our work atLa Chorerra.” Here’s how he describes it in True Hallucinations: > In the gray of a false dawn, the wave of internal imagery faded away. I rose> from where I had been sitting for hours and stretched. The sky was clear, but> it was still very early and stars were still shining dimly in the west. In the> southeast, the direction toward which my attention had been focused, the sky> was clear except for a line of fog or ground mist lying parallel to the> horizon only a few feet above the tree tops on the other side of the river,> perhaps a half mile away As I stretched and stood up on the flat stone where I> had been sitting, I noticed that the line of fog seemed to have grown darker,> and now seemed to be churning or rolling in place. I watched very carefully as> the rolling line of darkening mist split into two parts and each of these> smaller clouds also divided apart. It took only a minute or so for these> changes to be executed, and I was now looking at four lens-shaped clouds of> the same size lying in a row slightly above the horizon, only a half mile or> so away. A wave of excitement swept through me followed by a wave of definite> fear. I was glued to the spot, unable to move, as in a dream.> As I watched, the clouds recoalesced in the same way that they had divided> apart, taking another few minutes. The symmetry of this dividing and> rejoining, and the fact that the smaller clouds were all the same size, lent> the performance an eerie air, as if nature herself were suddenly the tool of> some unseen organizing agency. As the clouds recoalesced, they seemed to grow> even darker and more opaque. As they all became one, the cloud seemed to swirl> inward like a tornado or waterspout, and it flashed into my mind that perhaps> it was a waterspout—something I still have never seen. I heard a high-pitched,> ululating whine come drifting over the jungle tree tops, obviously from the> direction of the thing I was watching.> The siren sound was rapidly gaining pitch, and in fact, everything seemed to> be speeding up. The moving cloud was definitely growing larger rapidly, moving> straight toward the place where I was. I felt my legs turn to water and sat> down, shaking terribly. For the first time, I truly believed in all that had> happened to us, and I knew that the flying concrescence was now about to take> me. Its details seemed to solidify as it approached. Then it passed directly> overhead at an altitude of about two hundred feet, banked steeply upward, and> was lost from sight over the edge of the slope behind me.> In the last moment before it was lost, I completely threw open my senses to it> and I saw it very clearly. It was a saucer-shaped machine rotating slowly,> with unobtrusive, soft, blue and orange lights. As it passed over me I could> see symmetrical indentations on the underside. It was making the whee, whee,> whee sound of science fiction flying saucers.> My emotions were all in a jumble. At first I was terrified, but the moment I> knew that whatever was in the sky was not going to take me, I felt> disappointment. I was amazed and I was trying to remember what I had seen as> clearly as possible. Was it real in the naive sense in which that question is> asked of UFOs and tables and chairs? No one saw this thing as far as I know. I> alone was its observer. I believe that had there been other observers, they> would have seen essentially what I have reported, but as for “real,” who can> say? I saw this go from being a bit of cloud to being a rivet-studded aircraft> of some kind. Was it more true to itself as cloud or aircraft? Was it a> hallucination? Against my testimony can be put my admitted lack of sleep and> our involvement with psychedelic plants. Yet curiously this last point can be> interpreted in my favor. I am familiar through direct experience with every> known class of hallucinogen. What I saw that morning did not fall into any of> the categories of hallucinated imagery I am familiar with.> Yet also against my testimony is the inevitable incongruous detail that seems> to render the whole incident absurd. It is that as the saucer passed overhead,> I saw it clearly enough to judge that it was identical with the UFO, with> three half-spheres on its underside, that appears in an infamous photo by> George Adamski widely assumed to be a hoax.

(TH, pp. 157-159) A day later, on March 15, with the UFO incident and Terence’s account of itstill echoing in our memories, a flying object distinctly of this dimensionappeared on the horizon. A moment later the bush pilot’s floatplane settled onthe water and taxied to the dock. It took only a few minutes to toss aboard ourgear, which we’d reduced to our notebooks, plant presses, the butterfly net, andspecimens, leaving much of the rest behind. Moments later we had cleared thetreetops, and the humped cattle in the verdant pasture at La Chorreradisappeared into the mists.The pilot dropped us off in Leticia, a port town on the Amazon in the farsoutheastern corner of Colombia, near the borders of Brazil and Peru. We checkedinto a cheap hotel and enjoyed our first hot showers and restaurant food sincewe’d left Florencia some forty-five days earlier. After a couple of days there,we headed for Bogotá.To all outward appearances, I was much improved. I knew where I was, more orless, and could carry on a conversation, more or less, at least according toTerence. From my own sketchy recollections, I’d say I was far from fully well. Icould put on a brave face and maintain decorum in public, but I hadn’t yetentirely left the world of fantasy, puns, and wild ideas. Then again, I wasdefinitely on the mend. Whatever had happened to me, whether a protractedbiochemical imbalance or a loss of my way in a trackless shamanic wilderness, Iwas slowly returning.The Bogotá interlude passed quietly. We spent much of our time in Ev’sapartment, where I mostly stayed in bed, often engaged in conversation with alarge, skull-shaped stain on the ceiling. Words in conversations would set meoff into poetry and puns. I was still in a dream state most of the time, awakeor not; but the bizarre ideations and voices were slowly fading.Terence mentions that on March 20 we all celebrated at one of Bogotá’s finerrestaurants, and that the others agreed I was “totally back.” They weren’t awarethat, in my mind, I was in telepathic communications with all the waiters, andthat our dishes were being wafted to the table by telekinesis. Rather than alarmthem, I kept that to myself. But except for a few episodes like that, I wasdoing all right. I didn’t want to talk about triggering the alchemicaltransmutation of my own DNA and the end of history. I was happy my privatevoyage had been allowed to play itself out, but I was just as happy to be ahuman being again, rooted in space and time. I was acutely aware of how close Ihad come to losing it completely, and I was grateful for my good fortune, myguardian angels, and my brother, Terence, who though he may have driven me mad,also brought me back, back from the screaming abyss. I am certain to this daythat without him I would have remained lost forever.While I may have been recovering, Terence was not. He often sat cross-legged onthe floor near me, reading from what was perhaps the I Ching, writing in histiny script, making his calculations and graphs. As I lay enveloped in my ownreveries, I didn’t pay close attention to what he was doing there, bent over hisnotebook like a half-mad Talmudic scholar.“I was caught up in an obsessive immersion, almost an enforced meditation, onthe nature of time,” he writes. “My attention was entirely claimed by my effortsto build a new model of what time really is.” This marked the start of hiseffort to commit his timewave concept to paper. He began with a forty-day cycleas the crucial wheel in his temporal engine. Only later did he swap that out fora sixty-four day cycle tied to the I Ching, drawn by the correlation between itssixty-four hexagrams and the sixty-four codons that form the basis of thegenetic language of DNA. (I’ll look at this development later.) That initial“crude, self-referential, and idiosyncratic” work in Bogotá would evolve greatlyover the years, until the timewave eventually achieved a certain formality andelegance, worthy to behold. Whether his model represents the structure of timeat all levels and everywhere, I have my doubts. Nevertheless, as Terenceconcludes: “It was only my faith that it could be made coherent and rational toothers that kept me at it for those several years, transforming the originalintuition into a set of formal propositions.”I’d say that Terence’s activity had as much to do with his reintegration as itdid with constructing a formal theory of time. As I was condensing through levelafter level of space, Terence was attempting to build an instrument for temporalnavigation. His device would establish, first, our place in time, and then trackour movement toward a future moment at which the spiral of time would condenseto an infinitesimal point, just as space would collapse to a point that would beits own singularity.I’ll save my critique of the timewave as a scientific theory for anotherchapter. Whatever its value in that regard, constructing and calibrating thetimewave was, for Terence, an alchemical exercise—that is, an ongoing act ofindividuation in the Jungian sense. Ultimately, it was clear he’d been trying tomap his own odyssey through time as much as define time’s hidden structure. Asall theories of everything must be, his was only partially successful, and sothe pursuit of his individuation remained a work in progress, never completed,even at the time of his death. But individuation is almost by definition alife’s work, an important task that perhaps in the end few of us ever finish. After a few more days in Bogotá, we were all in a dissipative state, exhaustedfrom our adventures. We still had no word on the whereabouts of Dave and oursupplies. Vanessa saw little point in sticking around and flew home to New York,and then I decided to return to Boulder. I felt well enough to travel, and Iwanted to get my feet back on the ground in a familiar place. I also desperatelyneeded new glasses. The replacement pair I’d picked up in Bogotá weren’t muchgood.I had no idea when I left Colombia that I’d never see Dave again. He remained inSouth America for the next thirty-five years. I don’t know much about the laterlife of a man who shared that formative moment so early on in mine. If our tripwas any measure, he was a guy whose basic goodness led him to get too caught upin the obsessions of others, namely ours. Then again, that pretty much defineswhat it is to be young, adventurous, and open to experience. We brieflyreconnected by phone and email in 2007 when he returned to visit his agingparents in upstate New York. Shortly before his scheduled departure for his homein Bolivia he learned he had a virulent form of melanoma. He postponed hisreturn for treatment but it was for naught, and a few months later he was gone.On March 29, I arrived in Boulder; I’d been gone around sixty days but it feltlike centuries had passed. A few days later I left for Paonia to see my father.It was an uncomfortable meeting. He knew something had happened to precipitateour abrupt exit from La Chorrera and my premature return to the States (I hadplanned to stay until early summer). But we’d supplied no details beyond thatI’d gotten “sick” and had to be flown out. I haltingly tried to narrate theevents of the trip while omitting the most salient parts; he could certainlysense that there was more to the story, but he didn’t probe too deeply, forwhich I was grateful. By then he may have reached a point where he knew betterthan to question us too closely. He just assumed we were both mad, and probablycriminals, and the less he knew the better. I’m quite sure he was still grievingover our mother’s death and likely in a deep depression.Terence and Ev remained in Bogotá for a few days after my departure. They took abrief trip to Florencia to get outside the city and relax, but something wasdrawing Terence back to Berkeley. He remained preoccupied with the theory oftime he’d begun roughing out in feverish notes, more convinced than ever that wehad stumbled onto something of vast and unimaginable import for humanity and theplanet. In his view, we’d been right all along, and that our only failure hadbeen in our efforts to identify the time and place of the stone’s concrescence.But his model of time would fix that. He was obsessed. He needed validation fromhis friends and intellectual peers.So Terence, still presumably a wanted man, took a risk and returned to Berkeleywith Ev, entering the country on the false passport he’d gotten in Japan. He hadno problems clearing the border; apparently Interpol and the U.S. government hadbetter things to do than to track a minor hash smuggler for a crime committedtwo years earlier. They reached Berkeley on April 13, and at Terence’sinsistence I flew out to join them.Terence and Ev stayed with friends for a couple of days, then Ev departed tovisit her parents in Southern California. On the day she left, Terence and I metwith a handful of our closest friends, all of them eager to hear our story.Terence remained in a state of persistent cognitive ecstasy, still obsessed withcycles, already beginning to plot his early timewave graphs, utterly convincedthat we’d succeeded at whatever it was we’d meant to do. The task was toconvince our peers, despite the lack of evidence that anything had happened, asfar as they could see. Terence’s tale left them politely, and not so politely,skeptical. Their basic response was, “You drove your brother crazy, and youfollowed him over the edge.” It’s a testament to his powers of persuasion thathe was able to seed the tiniest kernel of doubt in their surety we’d lost it.But overall, in their opinion, Terence had gone around the bend and I wasn’t farbehind. Without Ev there to back us up, it certainly looked like a case of folieà deux, triggered by too many drugs and too little intellectual rigor.This wasn’t what Terence wanted to hear. I don’t know what he expected. Hisfriends certainly didn’t fall all over themselves and say, “My God, man, you’vedone it, you’ve triggered the millennium, and you and Dennis are theimmortalized superconducting progenitors of a transformed species!” It was a lotto ask anyone to believe, and they were anything but a credulous bunch.For my part, I kept quiet. I didn’t dispute what Terence was saying, but I wasstill confused, still sorting things out. And my credibility was pretty muchshot. I wasn’t sure what had happened. In any case, I’d had enough, at least fora while.A few days after that meeting, I traveled down the coast to visit Deborah andcelebrate her birthday. I hadn’t seen her for about four months, and I missedher, but it was a less than a joyful reunion. She was cold and distant, ourlovemaking furtive under the circumstances and her heart no longer in it. Shehad rediscovered her fundamentalist Christian roots since her return and wasfeeling quite guilty about our liaison. I didn’t know it then, but I wouldn’tsee her again for five years. During that time she would lacerate my heart in somany ways the recollection still pains me.After a brief return to Berkeley, I departed for Colorado. I’d lost a semesterof school by going to Colombia; I suppose it was a measure of my disillusionthat I regarded the trip that way, as a loss. I’d yet to realize that myeducation there went far beyond what I ever would have learned had I spent thosemonths in Boulder. I wanted to get back into summer school, get my teeth intosome studies, do some ordinary, tangible things. I had not abandoned orrenounced our discoveries. I was still caught up in them, though not as much asTerence. One thing I was clear about: I was going to change my major fromanthropology and religious studies to biology and biochemistry.After La Chorrera, Terence was ready to renounce science. He asserted that ourexperience had shown science to be bankrupt, science could never explain whathad happened to us, and we should reject it—an attitude he held for the rest ofhis life. I was not so sure. I granted that our experiences had certainlystretched the boundaries of the known, that there was no ready scientificexplanation of the events that had gone down at La Chorrera. But, I pointed out,we were not scientists. We may have been magicians, shamans, alchemists, ormadmen, but we weren’t scientists. Not at the time. We had no real scientifictraining, and we didn’t know how to think like scientists. Had we understood thescientific method, we might not have stumbled into a cognitive wilderness wherewe lost our way.I knew scientific thought had its limits; but before we could reject science,the most powerful set of intellectual tools ever developed by the human mind, wefirst had to learn how to do science. Then, if we still wanted to reject it, wecould do so as scientists, with full knowledge of what it we were rejecting. Wehad to become scientists, or at least I had to become one. So I set aboutchanging my academic trajectory and started studying both science and thephilosophy of science.That decision was a pivotal diversion in our continued intellectual development.I’ve spent my life since then studying and practicing science. As I result, I’mnow acutely aware of how powerful science is, and how extremely limited. Thereare many things in heaven and earth that are beyond the ken of science, and mayremain so forever. Anyone who has taken psychedelics seriously or had othertranscendent experiences is likely to share that conclusion.At the same time, science remains the most effective method for asking questionsof nature and getting back answers that can be tested and validated. Everythingwe know about the biological aspects of consciousness, everything we know abouthow psychedelics do what they do at the molecular level, is the product ofhard-won scientific investigation. What science has not yet done, and may neverbe able to do, is to span the gap between what science has revealed about thephysicochemical foundations of consciousness and our subjective experiences oftruth, beauty, dreams, memories, love and emotions, and, yes, even hyperspatialdimensions, self-transforming machine-elves and all the rest of the shamanicmenagerie. Building that bridge is to my mind the great challenge of thetwenty-first century. I have little doubt that science will play a critical rolein unraveling these mysteries, if they are to be unraveled at all. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 34 - Reflections on La Chorrera [images/00008.jpg]> The chorro at La Chorrera. (Photo by S. Hartley) The months leading up to our descent into the abyss, followed by the months wespent stumbling out, defined a crucial period in our lives. The two brothers whofound themselves in Berkeley in April 1971 were not the same people who shovedoff from Puerto Leguizamo in early February, so fired with dreams and delusions.Now that I have finished my narrative of that pivotal epoch, I want to step backand attempt a reflection on those events from a distance of forty-one years.First, I must admit it is somewhat disturbing that to the extent we are known toa wider world, it is because of events that played out when we were stillachingly young. Though most of my life has occurred after our trip to LaChorrera, the years since then have been haunted by its shadow, and I believethe same was true for Terence while he was alive. We went on to pursue careersand raise families, to write books and conduct research, to travel and teach inour efforts to make our mark in the world. We kept plugging away at the Mystery,though without the energy or recklessness that fueled our original quest.Nevertheless, the unsettling fact is that what we’ll be remembered for, if we’reremembered at all, is an episode of aberrant behavior that others might havetried to expunge from their life stories.Whatever our separate accomplishments, they are modest indeed compared to whatwe hoped to accomplish at La Chorrera, which was nothing less than to trigger anend to history, throw open the gates of a paradise out of time and invitehumanity to walk in. You can’t get more ambitious than that. But what was itthat led us to form that wild ambition in the first place? Megalomaniacalobsessions rarely rise to such a level, and they’re generally diagnosed aspathology when they do, to be treated with medication and even physicalrestraint. Whether by cleverness or luck, we got to act on our obsessions to anappalling degree.And yet, looking back on that interlude, I have to wonder: Was there more to itthan mere pathological delusion? Were any of the apparent paranormal phenomena“real”—that is, objectively verifiable? Who was the Teacher and why were itslessons such a strain on credulity and yet so insistent? Subsequent analysis hasshown many of our ideas to be outlandish and implausible, but not all of them: afew appear to have been gems of actual insight. For example, research has shownthat tryptamines and beta-carbolines, among other compounds, can intercalateinto DNA, at least in the test tube. And while no one has proven that DNA andother macromolecules might behave like superconductors under certain conditions,the concept has not been disproven, let alone entirely dismissed. Both issueshave been taken seriously in the years since La Chorrera, though neither waseven suspected before then. (For example, on DNA as a superconductor, see Lakhnoand Sultanov 2011, and Kasumov et al. 2001.)As for Terence’s timewave, it may not be an accurate map of time, much less atool for predicting some final event, but it does embody genuine insights,including his discovery of an ancient calendrical function to the I Ching thatmodern scholars had apparently not detected. Like the Book of Changes, thetimewave may be a useful divinatory tool in itself, if one is willing to seedivination as basically the discernment of correspondences between inner andouter states. In that sense, the timewave works, much as astrology and othersuch methods work—just don’t expect scientific proof or quantifiableverification.When I reflect on what led us to undertake our quixotic journey, I’m led back tothe years in Berkeley and Boulder when we first encountered and puzzled overDMT. As I’ve suggested, this substance wasn’t just the most astonishing drugwe’d ever encountered, it was the most astonishing thing—and as such it wassurely worthy of investigation. Given our intellectual path until that point, itwasn’t in us to say, “Oh, that’s interesting,” and then move on. A major reasonfor our fascination could be attributed to our lifelong immersion in sciencefiction, aliens, other dimensions, and related topics. As Terence eloquently putit, the DMT experience is “an audience with the alien nuncio.” Taken under theright circumstances—high doses, darkness, and paying close attention—DMT andpsilocybin seem to emerge straight from a mash-up of Arthur C. Clarke and PhilipK. Dick. One sees cartoon-like, multicolored, 3-D visions, urgently presented byelfish or clownish beings who may seem amusing but who, it is clear, desperatelywant the “viewer” to understand what is being presented. Whether one is seeingarchitectures, or landscapes, or machines, or organisms, is not entirely clear.The visions partake of the quality of all of these and more, but what they are,exactly, remains inexplicable. What is clear is that they are fascinating tocontemplate, and their contemplation evokes ecstasy. Terence and I wereconvinced that DMT had some connection to aliens long before we ever consideredgoing to La Chorrera. We thought that DMT bore a message of some kind, eitherfrom another dimension or another civilization elsewhere in our universe.Is it possible that we were right? I still believe it might be so. Most “sober”discussions about the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI, presumethat contact with aliens will first occur via radio signals we’ll eventuallydetect if we build ever-better radio telescopes and search many bandwidths inall parts of the sky. Any other interpretation or scenario is immediatelydismissed. For instance, what about the notion that crop circles are messagesfrom alien intelligences? This isn’t seriously discussed; yet crop circlesremain a real mystery, a phenomenon that certainly appears to be the handiworkof intelligence even if we have no other clue as to what they actually mean. AndI’m sorry, but to explain away crop circles as hoaxes perpetrated by midnightrevelers after the pubs close doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. That may be true ofthe crudest and smallest examples, but the gigantic, geometrically complexcircles that appear overnight are not the work of drunken hooligans stumblingabout in the dark.So, in crop circles we have solid, physical evidence of a phenomenon thatindubitably exists, that is completely beyond human understanding and abilities,and that almost certainly originates from a non-human intelligence. And yet theresponse of the “respectable” SETI community is a big ho-hum; crop circles donot sit well with their assumptions that extraterrestrial contact, when and ifit comes, will arrive in the form of an electromagnetic signal visible to ourdetectors. This notion seems almost laughably absurd. A galaxy-spanningcivilization tens of thousands or even millions of years ahead of our own is notgoing to use a crude, nineteenth-century invention like a radio transmitter tocontact us. Such pedestrian thinking is the reason why conventional approachesto SETI are doomed to fail; they are pre-programmed to focus on a singletechnology that most technological civilizations will have only utilized for atiny fraction of their history, if at all. Signs of alien intelligence that falloutside this model are ignored.Any civilization that wants to communicate with us (or wants us to be aware ofits existence) is apt to proceed cautiously and use unanticipated means to makecontact. Considered in this light, the notion that DMT, psilocybin, and theother psychoactive tryptamines are the calling cards of an advanced civilizationis not so far-fetched. This explanation certainly seems to be the message thatmany people take away from their experiences with high doses of DMT ormushrooms. It was the message that was downloaded to us at La Chorrera in 1971and regularly reaffirmed in subsequent encounters.One important difference between then and now is that many more people havetaken mushrooms and, to a lesser extent, DMT. What’s more, growing numbers haveshared the sense of alien contact, the sci-fi tinged ideations, the quasi-technoquality of the bizarre machine-like objects that we first experienced at LaChorrera (and many times since). The consensus suggests that these visions areintrinsic to the experience rather than to the personalities of two nerdybrothers. People who have never heard of us, and who aren’t science-fictionenthusiasts, nevertheless commonly report experiences permeated with a sense ofthe alien “other.”Such reports have even entered into the scientific literature, as in theexperiences documented by Rick Strassman, M.D., in his FDA-approved study usinghigh doses of pure, injected DMT. Many of the experiences reported by hissubjects bore an uncanny resemblance to classic descriptions of UFO closeencounters, even to the extent of being enclosed in a dome-like space,surrounded by seen or sensed alien entities, and undergoing a medicalexamination of some kind. As Strassman recounts in his 2001 book DMT: The SpiritMolecule, those stories were impossible to stuff into any kind of explanatoryframework acceptable to conventional science. “I chose to disregard reports Ihad heard about contact with beings on DMT and was unprepared for dealing withtheir frequency in our work,” he writes. That and other factors, including theinadequacies of the biomedical model upon which he’d been required to conducthis study, eventually led him to discontinue it and return his clinical-gradeDMT to the granting agency. So here we have a phenomenon: There exists in nature a family of relatedmetabolites widespread in plants, fungi, even in animals, including ourselves,that are close chemical relatives of the oldest known neurotransmitter,serotonin, and that are two or three trivial biosynthetic steps away fromtryptophan, an amino acid found in all earthly organisms. When these metabolitesare consumed by a certain class of omnivorous primates with complex nervoussystems and hypertrophied cerebral cortices, the substances regularly, thoughnot always, reveal the existence of what appear to be other dimensions, or otherplaces, objects, and images like nothing seen in ordinary waking consciousness.The substances, once ingested, are often associated with a sense of the presenceof other entities or forms of consciousness, which commonly seem to beproffering a message or lesson of some kind, or at least suggesting that theaforementioned big-brained primate pay attention and “get it.” Moreover, thereis often a good deal of congruency between what is seen and experienced bydifferent individuals; though the experiences are difficult to articulate, thereis enough similarity that those who have had such experiences can shareinformation, and make sense to each other, though not necessarily to those whohave not had them. The experiences have a quality of consensual reality that isat least as clear and communicable as most experiences of ordinary reality. Sowhat is going on?Possibility number one is that there actually are other dimensions, parallelrealities that these substances render accessible by temporarily altering ourneurochemistry and perceptual apparatus. According to this model, there reallyare entities that want to communicate with us, or at least don’t spurncommunication, when we poke our heads into their dimension. This is very closeto the understanding of reality that prevails in most shamanic worldviews.Possibility number two is the more parsimonious explanation, but it is almost asbizarre: For some reason, our brains have evolved the innate capability togenerate three-dimensional visions of indescribable complexity and beauty, andthat in psilocybin or other tryptamine states are presented to our innerperception accompanied by a sense of great emotional and intellectual import,and often seem to be narrated by a helpful entity, or entities, that areperceived as distinct from the self.Whether the first or second postulate is true, the conclusions from either arerather earth-shattering. If the first is true, then we are forced to reject, orat least radically revise, everything we think we know about reality. It makesour current models hopelessly obsolete and incomplete. All of human knowledge,all of our science and religion, must be reexamined in the light of theunderstanding that our cosmic neighborhood just “over there” is of a completelydifferent ontological order, and moreover, an order that is inhabited byentities as intelligent as we are or many times more intelligent, but that sharewith us the quality of consciousness, of mindedness. And they are entities thatwant to share their reality with us, their wisdom and knowledge, perhaps evenform a symbiotic partnership or some sort of diplomatic relationship. Whatever“they” are, they do not seem to be hostile, and they appear to take acompassionate interest in our species, much as an adult might want to love andnurture a child.On the other hand, if the second case is true, then the question stares us inthe face: Why? Why, in the course of neural evolutionary history, has the braindeveloped the neural architecture and systems to sustain such experiences? Whatis the point of it all? Perhaps it is a side effect of the evolutionary eventsthat resulted in cognition, language, and our ability to discern meaning inabstractions and symbols. Those familiar with psychedelic states will be awarethat psychedelics, especially mushrooms and other tryptamines, often triggersynesthesia, the translation of one sensory modality into another. Anyonefamiliar with the psychedelic experience will probably have experiencedsynesthesia at some point; it is the “hearing” of colors, or the “seeing ofsounds” though these are only the most trivial examples. Some people have agenetic propensity for synesthesia and experience the phenomenon routinely.Other people only experience it under the influence of psychedelics, and eventhen it can be rare. There are many kinds of synesthesia, and often they areassociated with the perception of numbers, letters, or words. For example, ingrapheme-color synesthesia, individual numbers or letters are tinged withcolors. In sound-color synesthesia, music or other sounds can inducefirework-like displays, or can change the color, scintillation, or directionalmovement of a perceived color. Even more bizarre forms of synesthesia are known,including “ordinal linguistic personification,” in which ordered sequences ofnumbers, words, or letters seem to have personalities; or the rarerlexical-gustatory synesthesia in which words or phonemes evoke gustatorysensations.Synesthesia is a fascinating but real phenomenon, and it has only recentlyre-attracted the attention of modern neuroscience. The connection betweengenetic or inherent synesthesia and psychedelic synesthesia has either beenlargely overlooked or deliberately ignored. I suspect the latter is true, butI’m puzzled by science’s failure to understand that psychedelics could beimportant research tools in our efforts to understand synesthesia, and byextension, cognition and consciousness itself.For years I’ve argued in lectures and writings that psychedelics, probablymushrooms, accidentally or deliberately ingested by early primates, triggeredsynesthetic experiences that formed the critical foundations of human languageand cognition, the association of inherently meaningless sounds or images withinherently meaningful symbols and ideas. Spoken or written language is asynesthetic activity that takes place effortlessly and automatically in theprocess of understanding a language. In speaking, the vocal apparatus produces“small mouth noises,” small puffs or explosions of air that are inherentlymeaningless. But because we have learned the language, we all participate in theconsensus that certain meaningless noises are associated with inner, visualizedimages or symbols that, as cognitive constructs, are imbued with meaning. Theseimages and symbols, seen by the mind’s eye and associated with symbolic import,supply the “meaning” to various vocal expressions. In reading, the process issimilar, except that a written symbol or word evokes an inner perception of thesound that is associated with the written word or symbol, and this, in turn,evokes an inner visualization of the meaningful symbol or word associated withthat sound. Is this not also synesthesia?What I’m suggesting, in effect, is that early on in the evolution of the humanneural apparatus, the ingestion of psychedelics triggered the invention oflanguage. I am not arguing here that psychedelics somehow affected our genes, atleast not directly; rather, that they are teaching tools. Creating and usinglanguage is an acquired skill, dependent on an ability to discernmeaning—significance—in images, sounds, and symbols. Psychedelics taught us howto do that; and, they are still teaching us! Once a small group or primates hadacquired that skill, it could be easily taught to others, especially with theaid of the psychedelic teaching tools.Language—and by this I mean complex language that depends on the comprehensionof abstractions—is the critical skill that separates humans from all otherspecies. The widespread emergence of language is the most important event in theevolution of human culture. Language allowed humans to transition from a speciesthat existed in a state akin to that of other primates, with seemingly limitedcognitive activity, to a species that is immersed in a world of abstractions andsymbols—in short, in an ocean of ideas—as real to our perceptions as thephysical world. Without language and an ability to comprehend it, we could nothave made the transition from biological to cultural evolution. Languageprovides a means to codify and store information, and transmit it across timeand space, down through generations and across geographical boundaries, withoutdepending on the genome.While language is an extra-genomic technology for storing and sharingaccumulated knowledge, an enormously large proportion of the human neuralarchitecture is devoted to speaking and comprehending it. At some point in ourevolution, there must have been a feedback between the acquisition and practiceof language that resulted in a relatively rapid change in primate brainstructures over a few hundred thousand years—perhaps an epigenetic effecttransmitted through the maternal line (Wright and Gynn 2008). The consequencesare seen in the rapid emergence and spread of civilizations and technologiesthat started about 100,000 years ago and has been accelerating ever since.Having now literally wrapped the globe in our externalized nervous systems, weare nearing a moment when we’ll find ourselves constantly embedded in anever-expanding totality of human knowledge.To a large extent, this has already occurred. Nature—the biosphere—is nowencased within the cybersphere, and though the current instantiation is somewhatcrude, made of machines and fiber optic networks and satellites andelectromagnetic signals, I think that will probably change very soon. As newbiotechnologies and nanotechnologies emerge, we will reintegrate ourexternalized neural networks, and they will again disappear back into ourbodies, the boundaries between “bio” and “techno” will dissolve, and we willbecome a new type of human, individual nodes in a globe-spanning mycelialnetwork. We will still be humans, but not the same humans that first chippedstone axes on the Serengeti plains and gazed up at the stars and wondered. Atthat point, just as our ancestors did, we will again stand at a threshold in ourevolutionary odyssey, ready to emerge from our earthly chrysalis and begin ourdiaspora to the stars.If humanity is to have a destiny beyond the current dreary prospect ofproliferating population and the increasingly rapid strangulation of ourplanetary life support systems, this must surely be it. It is a mythos builtinto the human imagination; it is what psychedelics have been telling us is ourdestiny ever since the first mushroom was tasted by the first curious primate.To embrace this destiny may be the only way we can traverse the cultural,environmental, and economic narrow passage that we are now confronting. Thispassage is literally the birth canal leading to a new age, beyond history,beyond death, beyond time.In Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, he and co-writer Clarke articulate avision for humanity’s future that is not unlike the destiny we imagine forourselves. In the film, the monolith—a mysterious, alien artifact that is neverexplained—appears at critical junctures in our evolutionary and culturalhistory, just when it is needed to nudge our species along to the nextevolutionary jump. I would suggest that the psychedelic experience was whatKubrick had in mind when he introduced the concept of the monolith, or thefilm’s famous light show, as I’ve noted earlier. Indeed, I’ll go farther andventure that psychedelics have played a role in human neural and cognitiveevolution similar to that of Kubrick’s monolith.Psychedelics, particularly psilocybin and DMT, may in fact be alien artifactsseeded into the biosphere millions of years ago by a super biotechnologicalcivilization that has mastered the art and science of planetary biosphericengineering. Our planet, our biosphere, and our species could be the result of akind of science experiment lasting hundreds of millions or even billions ofyears, an experiment initiated by a superior technological civilization partlyout of curiosity (the real motivation behind all good science) and partly, Iwould suggest, out of loneliness. This hypothetical civilization may have wantedsomeone to talk to and thus created an intelligent species that could talk back.It would be a trivial matter for a biotechnologically sophisticated supercivilization to “seed” the early terrestrial biosphere with genes coding for thebiosynthesis of tryptophan and the simple tryptamines arising from it, includingthe oldest neurotransmitter in evolutionary terms, serotonin(5-hydroxytryptamine), and the simple indolealkylamines, which include thepsychedelic tryptamines DMT and its relatives, psilocin, psilocybin, and others.In evolutionary terms, the light receptors are among the oldest receptors, andserotonin receptors are closely homologous to them; they are nearly a billionyears old in the phylogenetic history of life. Serotonin has always played acritical function in signal transduction, and there is evidence that theevolutionary diversification of the main subtypes of biogenic amine receptorsoccurred, first, in the Precambrian, before the separation of arthropods fromvertebrates, followed by a second occurrence about 400 million years ago thatmay have signaled the cephalization of vertebrates (Vernier et al. 1993). Inother words, serotonin and the other tryptamines played a key role in theevolutionary emergence of complex nervous systems. Serotonin is of specialimportance to fetal brain development, particularly the wiring of the forebrain.Recent research has shown that the placenta, rather than the mother, is thesource of this hormone in the critical developmental stages (Bonnin et al.2011). The developing fetal mammalian brain is subject to other maternal andplacental influences, including those due to plant secondary products in thediet of the mother.This may seem like a pretty wild speculation, and it is, but given serotonin’scritical evolutionary role, the long process leading to the human brain couldhave been influenced or even controlled by a civilization that deliberatelyintervened in the history of life on earth, bioengineering the evolution ofintelligent species by seeding the biosphere with the gene complexes needed tofoster, over the course of hundreds of millions of years, the appearance ofcomplex nervous systems. Once the process was set in motion, our benevolentsuper-scientists had only to sit back and let nature take its course.Eventually, a big-brained species would emerge that could respond to the“message” encoded into psilocybin and DMT molecules—molecules specificallybioengineered to interact with those serotonin receptors that were able toreceive the message. The super civilization would have finally realized itsdesire to transmit a message by creating a species that could understand it.I am not the only one to speculate that evidence of alien civilizations—or atleast the possibility of such—will be found not in radio signals from a distantstar but within our own genomes. This idea is reflected, for example, in a 2010paper by computational neuroscientist Jean-Pierre Rospars in Acta Astronautica,the journal of the International Academy of Astronautics. Rospars argues thatthe evolution of intelligence in the universe, far from being a rare andcontingent event, is structurally built into the constraints of physics,chemistry, and biology. The fact that living creatures exhibit predictablelimits on body size, among many other functions, suggest there are universal“laws” that order evolution, including the evolution of intelligence; and humancultural evolution is an emergent and inevitable consequence of this process.According to this theory, there could well be more complex intelligent speciesthan ours endowed with far more complex brains. Furthermore, we could beseparated from these civilizations not so much by spatial distances but bytemporal and cognitive distances. Such alien intelligences may be vastly olderthan our species, and so much more advanced in their cognitive evolution thatnot only are we incapable of communicating with them, we are incapable ofrecognizing them.Randall D. Shortridge, a molecular biologist at the University of Buffalo, islikewise trying to elaborate a fuller picture of life and consciousness in whathe calls BioSETI, his “tongue-in-cheek” name for “identifying patterns…in themolecular-world of what might be loosely called ‘terrestrial space.’ ” As henotes on the project’s website, his approach is “a form of Complexity Theoryapplied to analysis of the human genome.” He acknowledges that mainstreamscience has assembled a pretty good view of the human genome and the informationit contains for coding the biological processes that constitute life. His hunch,however, is that there’s a lot more going on in the genome, where “many higherlevels of complexity exist beyond what is normally viewed as concrete andmeasurable. He then adds, “The basic hypothesis of BioSeti is that the humangenome may contain identifiable sequence patterns beyond what it is essentialfor growth and maintenance of the biological organism.” He makes a point ofdistancing himself from both sides in the creation debate, though heacknowledges that some of his ideas “might be shared with those espousingintelligent design.” > Preliminary evidence shows a surprisingly high correlation between ancient> cultural and mystical traditions with contemporary discoveries in molecular> biology.

Where have we heard these ideas expressed before? In some respects, these wordsread like the gnosis downloaded directly from the Teacher at La Chorrera. Thenotion, for example, that DNA functions in a way akin to the legendary akashicrecords, that it contains information at higher levels of organization thatextend far beyond its function in coding for protein synthesis. It may containcosmological, metaphysical, linguistic, possibly calendrical and mathematicalinformation that is not readily apparent from a reductionist view of DNA that isnarrowly focused on its function as a blueprint for gene expression. Thereference to the analogies between DNA and the I Ching is particularly telling,and, as Shortridge notes, he isn’t the first to point this out. Nor was Terence.The analogy is indisputably there, which begs the question, just what “message”was the Teacher trying to convey to us, at La Chorrera? And, along with that,are the “mushroom” and the Teacher one and the same?Terence encapsulated his view in a “myth” that first appeared in our how-tomanual, Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower’s Guide, published in 1976. Here’s anexcerpt:> > The mushroom speaks, and our opinions rest upon what it tells eloquently of> itself in the cool night of the mind:> ‘I am old, older than thought in your species, which is itself fifty times> older than your history. Though I have been on earth for ages, I am from the> stars.

Is the human species really being led toward a cosmicdestiny by establishing a symbiotic alliance with an intelligent mushroom fromthe stars? I have no idea. I would like that to be true. As wild as thatscenario sounds, it is at least as plausible as any other cosmological vision wemay choose to believe in, and it is much more plausible than most of the mythsposited by the world’s great religions, or even the scientific myths that areserved up as alternatives. On one hand, we have the Abrahamic creation storiesthat arose from the oral traditions of various Middle Eastern tribal cultures.There is not a shred of evidence that any of them are true. In fact, the closeparallels between those traditions only reveal how culturally bound they are,thus undermining any claims they each might make to being the one and onlytruth. But science also fails to portray a myth worthy of human destiny. Thebest that science can offer is that we are the accidental product of randomevents, a chaotic mix of particles aimlessly tumbling through space and time ina cold, dead universe devoid of mind or beauty or love or any of the qualitiesthat we experience and value. Really? This creation myth seems to my mind atleast as unlikely than those posited by various religions.Science, to its credit, abjures faith and demands that any scientific model ofreality be backed by evidence. Science does an excellent job of studyingphenomena in isolation and in great detail; but it does a poor job of fittingall those small, dissected pieces of reality together into a unified whole thathangs together, and that seems to fit our holistic experience of being. Thereductionist scientific models are impoverished and unsatisfying; they leavemore unexplained than they explain, and they, too, seem unable to account forthe improbable situation in which we find ourselves.And highly improbable it is indeed. Think about it: We are a conscious, mindedspecies that somehow arose on a minor planet circling a G star in some backwaterof the Milky Way. We have invented language and, proceeding from that, science,technology, religion, art, war, and all the other accoutrements of civilization.We have no idea whether we are unique in the universe, but there’s no reason tothink so. In line with the ideas of Jean-Pierre Rospars and many others, lifeevolves in accordance with certain “rules” of evolution; wherever the conditionsare favorable, life will arise, and once it has arisen, it’s likely that it willachieve intelligence. There’s no reason to think it has not happened dozens,hundreds, or millions of time in the history of the universe. But we have noproof that it has; it’s only a reasonable assumption at this point, a workinghypothesis if you will.And then “the mushroom” or whatever/whoever the mushroom represents, comes alongand matter-of-factly tells us how the boar ate the cabbage—how things reallyare. We are an immature species involved in a symbiosis with a much older andwiser mentor species; this species is trying to get us to wise up so that we canjoin the galactic community of minds, and do so before we manage to blow up theplanet and ourselves. It’s probably a scenario that has been repeated many timesin the history of the galaxy. It is a comforting myth, at least, and we canchoose to believe it, or not. Is there evidence for it? The closest thing tothat so far is a shared interpretation of what the mushroom seems to be tellingus, as reported by a growing number of people who have experienced psilocybinfirsthand.That is not “hard” evidence, but it is evidence of a sort. And it does notrequire faith, unlike religious myths, which do. No one is asking you toabdicate your critical faculties. The mushroom, or whatever that term standsfor, demands the exact opposite; it demands that we reject faith. All we need isthe courage to experience the phenomenon and judge it for ourselves. Those whotake this empirical, scientific view are apt to be presented with a model thatis plausible, or is at least not impossible, a model that suggests there justmay be such a thing as human destiny—and that our existence, as individuals andas a species, may have meaning after all. "},{"pageContent":"Part Three - Invisible Landscapes[images/00015.jpg] "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 35 - Invisible Landscapes By early summer 1971, I was living in a tiny room in Boulder and trying toreinvent the poor student I’d been before I left. I busied myself in summerschool and found a job as a dishwasher and server in a rest home. It wasn’t themost edifying work, but I took pleasure in the normality of it. I was stilldealing with the memories of our experiences in the jungle, but I had no one totalk to about them, least of all the pure-minded, fair-haired Peggy, mylonged-for, if mostly imaginary, flame. In a brief encounter with her, I triedto explain a bit about what had happened to me, but it was useless. Her reactionwas one of alarm, and no wonder, with me raving like a wild-eyed prophet backfrom his forty days in the wilderness. She didn’t know what to make of myaccount beyond not wanting to hear any more of it. She gently broke it to methat she had a new boyfriend, but I hardly took notice, being so caught up in myown drama.Terence, meanwhile, had spent the previous months in Berkeley, utterly absorbedin adapting his idea for a model of time to the inner machinery of the I Ching.As I noted earlier, the I Ching consists of sixty-four hexagrams, eachcorresponding to a different phase in a cyclical, Taoist model of time. Based onthat, Terence had, by then, assigned the numbers six and sixty-four a specialsignificance in his calculations. In True Hallucinations, he writes that herealized his relationship with Ev began sixty-four days after our mother’sdeath. Counting forward from our mother’s death by six such units, or 384 days,he discovered a thirteen-month lunar year that would end on his upcomingbirthday, November 16, 1971. These were the initial correspondences that gotTerence thinking about applying the I Ching to his timewave theory. Indeed, hisbirthday became the first of his projected end dates for the so-calledconcrescence—the final event the timewave seemed to predict.Then as before, Terence’s obsessive writing and charting seemed to be part of areintegration he’d begun after the bizarre events in March. Early on, thenumerical constructs he’d apparently downloaded from the Teacher had been keyedto our personal and familial history. He’d continue to refine the timewaveconcept for years, pushing it beyond its narrow confines toward something widerand more intricate, even elegant, in its peculiar, numerological way. He came tobelieve that the cycles within cycles he detected on a personal level wereactive on a historical, geological, and cosmological scale. Terence would lateruse the term “fractal time” to characterize these nested cycles, though when hefirst began his investigation the term fractal had yet to be coined.There is also the curious relationship between the I Ching and the structure ofDNA—that is, the “language” that DNA utilizes to code for the proteins thatexist in all living things. I’ve alluded to this earlier. Indeed, talk of thiscoincidence was in the air at the time. Since the mid-fifties, there had been agrowing popular interest in the ancient Chinese classic and in the double-helixstructure of the DNA molecule as well. The number of hexagrams in the I Chingcan be written as 26, or the number of 6-line hexagrams that can be made fromlines that can appear in either “broken” or “unbroken” form. In DNA, the numberof 3-letter codons that can be generated from 4 nucleotides can be written as43. The product in both cases: 64. That seemed to resonate with our belief at LaChorrera that we’d somehow hacked into the central store of knowledge that lifehad acquired and carried over time on a molecular level.Among the first to note the resonance between DNA and the I Ching was oneGunther Stent, a German-born professor of molecular biology at the University ofCalifornia in Berkeley. Stent explored the idea in his book The Coming of theGolden Age, which appeared in 1969. Terence actually visited Stent on campus,eager to share the insights from La Chorrera. Terence’s account of the put-downthat followed is one of the more comical and painful moments in TrueHallucinations. The encounter was not unlike mine with Peggy, in a sense. Eachof us had tried to express the ineffable to someone we hoped would understand,only to confront a reflection of ourselves raving like lunatics. I was lucky inthat mine occurred with a friend on the street. For Terence, the rebuff from oneof the era’s leading biologists revealed something of his ambivalence aboutscience. He loved scientific concepts and language, both of which he was knownto borrow for his own playful and metaphoric purposes. He knew the lessons of LaChorrera involved an intuitive leap over an abyss that science in its currentstate was unable to bridge. And yet he may have wanted the scientist toacknowledge an insight that couldn’t be verified in scientific terms. He hadasked one of the leading scientists of his day to endorse what was, in essence,a deconstruction of science, even a rejection of it, with humiliating results.That’s not to say his only doubters at the time were mainstream academics.During that spring and early summer, Terence’s efforts continued to baffle mostof his friends; despite his inborn persuasiveness, he had yet to win them over.In addition, rumor had it that the FBI had gotten wind of his illegal return tothe country, arousing his fear that the net cast after the 1969 hash bust mightbe closing. Both factors played into a decision by Terence and Ev to embark onwhat struck me, at least, as unthinkable: a return to La Chorrera.Overall, the rationale for that second trip seemed less than entirely rational.One unspoken motivation, I think, was nostalgia—a yearning for paradise thatmotivates humans to envision, and seek, magical realms beyond space and time, animpulse that may go back to when our womb-born species first began seeing itselfas a creature fallen from an original state of grace. La Chorrera might havemade for an unlikely Shangri-La, but there was no doubt that in our imaginationit had taken on this numinous aspect.While Terence felt compelled to go back, I had excellent reasons not to, as Imade clear in our talks. He thought we should try to repeat the experiment, evenas he paradoxically insisted that, according to the Teacher, we’d alreadysucceeded and now just had to wait for the concrescence to manifest. Our onlytask was to identify, if possible, when and where the concrescence would occur.For my part, I had no stomach for another expedition. I was happy to be back inordinary reality and not eager to put my ass and sanity back on the line.Moreover, I argued, what we’d experienced was an irreproducible event. It wasthe classic Heraclitean conundrum: we couldn’t travel the same river twice. Whathappened, I argued, shouldn’t be called an experiment for several reasons, butmost notably because it couldn’t be repeated. We could call it the singularity,the occurrence, or the events at La Chorrera, but whatever it came to be knownas, an experiment it was not.I had thrown myself into my studies, by then redirected toward science, which Ibelieved (and the Teacher agreed) would give me the tools to understand ourexperiences. I belonged in school. According to Terence, his friends weretroubled enough by his singular focus to encourage his return to the field,literally—back to the mist-enshrouded pasture from which his obsessions hadsprung. He needed to get away. What’s more, unlike me, he and Ev had the meansto do so, having bought a quantity of emeralds just before departing Colombia.Back in the States, they’d sold them for enough to travel and live modestly inSouth America for the foreseeable future.By mid-July they found themselves downriver from Puerto Leguizamo, pressing everdeeper into the jungles of the lower Putamayo. Over the weeks ahead, theyre-navigated the maze of rivers, drawn by the siren song of the fungal fruitingbodies that grew near an isolated mission on the Río Igara Paraná. They arrivedin late August. Aside from the rare letters they entrusted to the policecaptains at various towns along their route, I’d hear nothing from them for ninemonths.After my summer classes ended, I moved into a communal house a couple of blocksdown Pine Street from where I’d lived the year before. My housemates were afamiliar assortment of counterculture types, with one exception: Beverly, afellow student from Boston whom I immediately liked. Intelligent, studious,Jewish, and cute, she had an infectious laugh and liked my jokes. I have no ideawhat she saw in me, but before long we’d gotten together. Beverly was no hippiechick. I took delight in corrupting her, but I didn’t get very far. Both of usdisliked living in a house with four other people, and by Thanksgiving we’dfound our own place—a tiny upstairs apartment a bit closer to the foothills.By then, Terence and Ev were on their way out. Their second visit had been lessproductive in terms of mushrooms, which were less abundant than before. Whattrips they took seemed less charged with the immanence of the Other—there wereno UFO sightings, and the weather during the dry season yielded fewer mysteriousanomalies. Terence did a lot of writing and thinking, however, much of which hechronicled in his journal. He continued to refine his speculations on the hiddenpatterns of time despite a frustrating lack of reference materials. His firstpredicted date for the concrescence—his twenty-fifth birthday in November—cameand went without incident, a disappointing test for the timewave in itsprototypal form.Word had reached him via our father that a plea deal for his prior smugglingactivities might be in the offing. The time seemed right for heading home. Thetrip was full of delays, weeks spent in mosquito-infested, riverine outpoststhat wore them down. They finally reached a city we’d passed through earlier,Florencia, the capital of the Department of Caquetá in southeast Colombia. In achance encounter in a tienda, they met a guy who was home for Christmas fromEurope. The son of a local journalist, Luis Eduardo Luna was about a yearyounger than Terence. Terence was trying to buy a few items using his brokenSpanish. Luis Eduardo, overhearing him, offered in perfect English to help. LuisEduardo had been studying philosophy and literature at the UniversidadComplutense in Madrid. After hearing an account of what had led the wearytravelers to Florencia, he invited them to stay in a small house his familyowned a few miles out of town. Thus began a friendship that was to last untilTerence’s death.Their stay at Villa Gloria, as the place was called, was an idyllic time forTerence and Ev, a chance to rest, eat good food, and enjoy the pleasant company.Terence had a quiet place to work on his writings, which by then were coalescinginto a book. He also had a receptive audience for his outlandish and captivatingraps. I wasn’t there, of course, but I picture something like what I’d seen inBerkeley where similar scenes played out many times. As for Luis Eduardo, he’dnever been exposed to such ideas, let alone to the Santa Marta gold that Terencehad brought with him. A former seminary student, Luis Eduardo was leaning moretoward Marxism and atheism at the time, but those long talks at Villa Gloria mayhave encouraged him to revisit an earlier fascination with the mysteries ofexistence. By the time he returned to Europe, his academic priorities hadshifted to physics, chemistry, botany, and neuroscience. He later earned a Ph.D.from the Institute of Comparative Religion at Stockholm University, where histhesis focused on the study of vegetalismo—the use of ayahuasca in shamanicpractices among the mestizo populations of Peru (Luna 1986). Eduardo is nowconsidered the world’s authority on the ethnography of ayahuasca. I didn’t meethim until 1981, but since then he has been one of my closest colleagues andfriends. Following his fieldwork in the Peruvian Amazon in 1982, wecollaborated, with Neil Towers, on a review of the botany and chemistry ofayahuasca admixture plants that was published in 1986 in the journal AmericaIndigena (McKenna, Luna, and Towers 1986) and later reprinted in a collectionedited by R.E. Schultes entitled Ethnobotany: Evolution of a Discipline (1995).Terence and Ev eventually made their way back via Bogotá and Mexico City,Terence’s false passport again serving him well, and landed at my door at theend of January. Or rather “our” door: Beverley and I had been living togetherfor a few weeks. Though she joined me in welcoming them, she might not have beensure what to make of these two gypsy seekers blown up on a southerly wind. I, ofcourse, was delighted to see them. The core of the brotherhood was togetheragain.Terence’s dubious legal status made it necessary for him to keep a low profile.He and Ev found menial jobs cutting roses at one of the flower businesses nearLongmont. They got up early to catch the bus to work and spent all day at theireasy task; each night the dope came out and the conversation flowed as wereflected on the previous year and tried to sort out what it all meant. It was atime of bonding and camaraderie for us, but not for Beverley, who felt left out.I must admit I didn’t help matters, partly because of my ambivalence toward ourrelationship, which I attribute to the sense of emotional unavailability Ifelt—and may have cultivated, in my attachment to a series of likewiseunavailable love interests.The simple fact was that, instead of getting their own place, Terence and Ev hadmoved into an apartment that was too small for four people. Ev, who wasn’t aptto be friendly toward any woman who got near Terence at the time, turned Alphafemale and made it uncomfortable for Beverly to stick around. After a number ofpainful episodes, Beverly decided to move out. I behaved quite badly during thisepisode in not sticking up for her, and yet our friendship somehow survived.Though she certainly had her doubts about Terence, she might have seen somethingworthy of emulation in his intrepid character. I thought of her as a girl whowas afraid of things like bugs, who had no truck for camping or roughing it inany way. But after graduation she went on to work for various relieforganizations in some of the most challenging places on Earth: Haiti, Nicaragua,and the Congo, among other countries. You never know what reserves of strengthmay reside in a person, especially in that untested phase of life.Over those weeks, Terence and I began collaborating on the manuscript he’dbegun, then entitled Shamanic Investigations. We even had a few copies bound ata local bindery that specialized in university theses. It was satisfying to seethe large volume with its many hand-drawn charts and graphs fixed between hardcovers. At least something had resulted from our adventures beyond madness andbizarre ideas. We had no prospects for publication and were not really lookingfor them.After a few months clipping roses, Terence and Ev began talking about a returnto Berkeley. Before then, however, Terence had to deal with his legal issues.I’m not sure what inquiries were made or how the matter proceeded to be soeasily resolved; I do remember that Terence and our father went to the FederalBuilding in Denver accompanied by a lawyer. As Terence later told it, heannounced at the courthouse that he was there to turn himself in, but nobodyseemed to know what he was talking about. After a search, someone found thepaperwork and had him fill out a few forms and schedule a court appearance. Itwas all politely bureaucratic—hardly the reception an international fugitivemight have expected after eluding capture for nearly three years.Once the case was settled, I believe he got three years unsupervised probationin return for telling them “everything he knew” about his hashish suppliers.Terence’s response was a long, rambling account with references to an auto bodyshop in a back alley in Bombay, as I recall. When I read the statement monthslater, I assumed he’d made it all up, but it apparently satisfied theauthorities. To the best of my knowledge, the whole mess ended there; he neverheard another word about it. Terence and Ev moved to Berkeley early in the summer of 1972. They found a smallhome only a block or so from the Telegraph House where Terence had lived beforehis travels began in October 1967. His life soon fell into a familiar routine.He reconnected with some of his butterfly contacts, including a wealthy Japanesebroker who had subsidized Terence’s collecting efforts in Indonesia while he wason the run. Before long, new specimens to mount began arriving in batches viathe mail, creating a great job he could do stoned, at home, and in the presenceof company. After I moved to Berkeley a year later, I spent many an hour in theupstairs loft where Terence worked. Various characters from our eclectic andpeculiar circle would stop by for a smoke and a bit of raving. By then Terencehad filled a formerly neglected garden out back with various psychoactivespecies, including a riot of morning glories dotted with a few datura bushesalong the fence. He was back in his element.Terence’s departure for California marked a new stage in the slow bifurcation ofour lives. Another familial shift during the summer of 1972 was our father’sremarriage. Lois, a woman from Delta he’d met through his golfing friends,looked a bit like our mother, though the similarities ended there. Dad had beenlonely after Mom’s death and was slowly sinking into alcoholism and despair. Iwas happy when he found a nice person to live with, and, on balance, I’d say hissecond marriage benefited him. But the union wasn’t an entirely happy one.Nobody could have replaced our mother in our father’s eyes, though I think heunfairly expected that of Lois. She may have resented him for putting that onher, and rightly so; he may have resented her for not being the love of hislife. They remained together twenty-five years until my father’s death.The undergraduate degree I completed in the spring of 1973 was in a thing called“distributed studies,” meaning my coursework had been “distributed” over severalareas rather than concentrated in one or two majors. My primary emphasis was inbiology with secondary specialties in anthropology and philosophy, particularlythe philosophy of science. It was a degree that qualified me for almost nothingexcept graduate school—and certainly not a job.Nevertheless, my education, post-La Chorrera, was far from a waste; I valued itfor helping me make sense of our experiences there and for directing me towardmy later studies. I’ve mentioned how my trip to South America left me eager tolearn more about science and scientific thinking, if only so I could morehonestly reject the scientific worldview. I threw myself into biological studiesfor the remainder of my undergraduate years, thanks largely to a gifted mentor,Charles Norris, a biology professor who encouraged my interest in the philosophyof science. Under his guidance, I designed my own curriculum andindependent-study courses. Instead of rejecting science, I found myselftransfixed by the latest thinking in theoretical biology. The works thatinfluenced me included The Phenomenon of Life (1966) by the philosopher HanJonas; General Systems Theory (1968) by the biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy;Hierarchical Structures (1969), edited by Scottish thinker Lancelot Law Whyte;the chemist Ilya Prigogine’s ideas about non-equilibrium thermodynamics,dissipative structures, and self-organizing systems; and the neurosurgeon KarlPribram’s holographic model of certain brain processes. Terence was conductinghis own inquiry into these and other works. In sharing our insights, we wereamazed to discover a conceptual framework in which some of the “crazy” ideasthat emerged at La Chorrera seemed not so crazy after all.Of all these new influences, the work of Alfred North Whitehead had the greatestimpact on us. Whitehead’s “organismic” philosophy provided a logically rigorousmetaphysics that seemed not only consistent with the current scientificunderstanding of reality but also fit many of our own speculations. Whitehead’snotions about “process” and the “ingress,” or entrance, of novel events intoreality greatly appealed to us. By then, the timewave was on its way to becominga complex metaphysical system in itself; Whitehead’s concepts seemed a way todescribe, and even quantify, its principles. Though Whitehead had been one ofEngland’s leading mathematicians earlier in his career, his later philosophicalworks incorporate certain aspects of Eastern thought and animism. We realized wehad no need to seek a rationale for our beliefs in exotic and alien religions orphilosophies; Whitehead’s metaphysics, though ensconced in the Westerntradition, had what we were looking for, namely, the perspective that in somesense everything is alive and changing over time.In Whitehead’s view, everything from atoms to galaxies are “organisms” withtheir own processes and rules of self-organization. Another key idea is thatconsciousness pervades the continuum; it is as fundamental to the structure ofreality as the electron or the quark. Truth and beauty, even love, are intrinsicto existence, not qualities pasted onto a dead universe by deluded souls longingto find a meaning that isn’t there.Thus, for us, Whitehead’s philosophy seemed to demolish existentialist despair.Far from being a lifeless, terrifying place, the universe teemed with life;indeed the universe itself was alive. All this meshed with what the Teacher hadimparted at La Chorrera, and what our own evolving views had insisted upon.Whitehead’s insights were good news for a couple of Catholic kids who had longsince rejected the comforting fairytales offered up by their tradition. Hisphilosophy didn’t demand faith; rather, it allowed us to look at the universethrough the lens of a metaphysics that was open to scientific insight. Mystudies might not have made me a scientist per se, but they did give me anunderstanding of science that went beyond that of many practitioners who hadn’tstopped to think about what science really was, and how it operated. The eventsat La Chorrera had shoved our faces hard up against those questions, andWhitehead’s ideas in particular provided some answers. Decades later, that’sstill true; and to the extent that I have a spiritual belief, it is a secularsystem based largely on Whitehead’s philosophy.By the time of my graduation, however, my knowledge of theoretical biology andthe holographic brain still had me in the dark when it came to the patterns ofmy love life. Beverly had finished school and returned to Boston. Peggy wasstill in Boulder but the fact she was seeing someone else left little chancewe’d get together. I had more cause to think that Deborah and I might havereunited now that she’d finished school. Instead, the girl with whom I’d sharedsome of the happiest times I’d ever known was moving in with a fundamentalistsurfer dude on a boat. I should have made that the last heartbreak tied to myunhealthy attachment to her, but, well, I didn’t. Looking back on my romanticmisadventures from that era, I marvel at how miserable they made me, and howmuch time I wasted because of that misery. When my mother left me off in Boulderfor the start of college in 1969, I had no idea the years ahead were destined tobe so emotionally difficult and lonely at times. Do others become as obsessedover romantic loss as I did then? I suppose they do. According to the familiaradage, it’s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. I’mnot so sure.With no prospects for a good job in Boulder or Denver, I figured I might as wellrelocate and take a menial job in the Bay Area. By late summer 1973, I wasworking as a porter at a fancy restaurant in Kensington, near Berkeley. My jobwas to arrive early in the morning and open the place—collect the dirty laundry,mop the floors, chop up a big tub of salad greens, and generally get thingsready for the chefs when they arrived around midafternoon. It was a good gigthat fit my temperament. I’d get there at 6:30, fix myself a huge breakfast anda pot of coffee and read the San Francisco Chronicle before lifting a finger.Nobody cared what I did as long as I finished my chores on time. In theafternoon, I’d stop by Terence’s, get loaded, and join that day’s activities atthe perpetual salon. By the summer and fall of 1973, Nixon’s Watergate scandalhad begun to preoccupy the country. Over the months until the president’s forcedresignation on August 9, 1974, we followed the television coverage obsessivelyand gleefully as Tricky Dick became ever more mired in troubles of his ownmaking. Every day, it seemed, there’d be a new outrage reported on the eveningnews, and we could hardly wait to tune in.By the spring of 1974, the manuscript Terence and I had worked on in Boulder,and again over the previous summer, had gotten the attention of Justus GeorgeLawler, an editor at Seabury Press. I don’t recall how Lawler, a respectedCatholic scholar and author, became aware of our book, but he asked us to submita copy for examination, which we did. Lawler said he loved the book and wantedto publish it.Seabury, a small publishing house in New York originally established in theearly fifties by the Episcopal church, seemed an unlikely venue for us. Itsbacklist included many religious and theological books, and the closest they’dcome to a radical work like ours was The Thought of Teilhard de Chardin byMichael H. Murray (1966). Lawler, however, may have been pushing the companybeyond its usual repertoire. Around that time, Seabury also published the Polishsci-fi author Stanislaw Lem’s weird surrealist drug novel, The FuturologicalCongress. Lawler’s support was great news, but he insisted on a title other thanShamanic Investigations. I took a walk in Tilden Park in the hills behindBerkeley, and after a little assist from Sister Mary I came up with TheInvisible Landscape, which both Terence and Ev liked. We got a modest advance($1,200 split between us, as I remember) and a deadline: Seabury needed thefinal manuscript before the end of the year to release our book the followingspring.We had a lot of work to do. Certain parts of our exposition had to be supported,if possible, with scientific evidence, and our wildest assertions needed to betoned down. Importantly, the mathematical basis of the timewave had to bedeveloped and a computer program devised to generate the numbers. This task wasbeyond us, but luckily one of Terence’s friends had access to the universitycomputers and wrote some code. (Other programmers would later contribute to thetimewave as well.) Terence and I had a lot of fun working together over the nextfew months. We knew we were on a creative roll, and the revisions forced us toreexamine our assumptions as we tried to render them comprehensible to theoutside world. By mid-September we’d finished a version and submitted it to thepublisher. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 36 - The Timewave [images/00020.jpg]> The Timewave (Illustration by T. McKenna) Before resuming my account, I want to give my take on Terence’s Timewave Zerotheory, which figured centrally in The Invisible Landscape. Briefly stated, whatTerence first conceptualized (or channeled) at La Chorrera is a mathematicalmodel that supposedly reveals the structure of time. As a means for mapping thepast and future, the timewave can be used, in Terence’s view, to chart theadvent of “novelty” and its impact on later events. The “wave” aspect refers tothe belief that novelty levels predictably ebb and flow, and that periods ofintense novelty coincide with disruptions in the patterns of culture, evolution,and even physics. As for “zero,” that marks the point of “maximized” novelty,which as I write purportedly lies just months ahead. Anyone familiar withTerence’s timewave knows that he settled on the winter solstice in December 2012as its end point, which is also the generally accepted date for the “end” of theMaya Calendar. At different times he cited both December 21 and 22 as the actualday.Though I wrote certain sections of The Invisible Landscape that dealt with myown experiences at La Chorrera, I’m actually one of the harsher critics of thetimewave theory. In fact, I don’t believe it is a true theory, in scientificterms. There are gaps and loopholes in Terence’s construct that, under scrutiny,are hard to defend. As the brother of the person who arguably has done more thananyone to turn the winter solstice of 2012 into a global meme, some might accuseme of being at best unsporting on this issue, and at worst an annoyingcurmudgeon. I plead guilty on both counts.Terence and I became fascinated with the idea of novelty, as Whiteheadunderstood it. His concept of novelty can be loosely characterized as the beliefthat there really are new things under sun; and the “ingression” of theseunexpected events can affect the ongoing process we think of as reality. Basedon his metaphysics, I’m willing to grant that there is such a thing as novelty,and that its appearance can trigger massive change. But Terence and I disagreedover how this actually happened. Indeed, some of our more animated discussionsover the years were about defining novelty. What qualifies as a truly novelevent? How does it enter the continuum, and how do you know when it has? Morespecifically, how can the timewave map and predict the arrival of novelty ifyou’re not precisely sure what novelty is?Terence favored what might be called the “punctate” theory of novelty. Noveltyarrives in the form of dramatic events with global impact, like the atomic bombblast over Hiroshima in 1945, the Kennedy assassination, the crucifixion ofChrist, or the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. In his view, events ofthat magnitude have enormous impact on history and the subsequent unfolding ofhuman affairs. As truly novel occurrences, he saw it as possible to “fit” thetimewave to such moments in human history, or even to events like the impact ofthe Chicxulub asteroid that is thought to have killed off the dinosaurs somesixty-five million years ago. Once calibrated to past events, the timewave couldthen be extended out beyond the realm of what has already undergone “theformality of actually occurring,” in Whitehead’s irresistible phrase, topredict, among other things, the future moment of its own end.In contrast, I argued in favor of the “gradualist” theory of novelty. Majorhistorical or geological events may appear to erupt into time, but that’s anillusion, one that ignores the chain of cause and effect that must precede them.Which event is truly novel—the nuclear explosion over Hiroshima, or that of thetest device in the New Mexican desert a few weeks earlier? Or was it when EnricoFermi first engineered a sustained nuclear reaction at the University of Chicagoin 1942? The mathematical basis for the bomb can be traced to 1905, whenEinstein stated that mass was a measure of energy, and vice versa, a brilliantinsight he boiled down to a famous equation, E=MC2. And surely Democrituscontributed by intuiting that the world is made of atoms back in the fourthcentury b.c. My point is that novelty does not “erupt” so much as “ooze” intohistory, thus making the identification of a truly novel event that much moreproblematic. The wave is hard to fit against the historical, geological, orevolutionary record because there are few points at which one can reliably alignthe map. And there is no way to quantify these events; Terence defined nocriteria for measuring whether one event is more novel than another.This is, to my mind, a major flaw in his novelty theory. Science works onmeasurement and quantification; to qualify as a scientific theory, it must bevalidated using measurable, quantifiable, and ideally mathematical criteria. Atrue theory must also state what new data or discovery can invalidate it. (Hereit is worth noting that a theory can be disproved, but never definitely proved;there is always the possibility that new data will overturn it.) The timewavedoes none of this. Thus it is not really a theory. It is a speculation, aninteresting idea, a hallucination, a fantasy—but not a theory. Terence neverprovided a quantifiable definition of novelty; I don’t think he knew how, andI’m not sure anyone does. But the result is that novelty in his “noveltytheory,” as it is also known, was defined as whatever Terence postulated it tobe.So, interesting as it is, Timewave Zero is utterly useless as a map of time, apredictor of events, or a mathematical theory that describes somethingfundamental about the world.The timewave’s other major influence was the I Ching and, in particular, anancient arrangement of its sixty-four hexagrams known as the King Wen sequence.In devising the timewave, Terence appears to have explained how that sequencemay have been used in neolithic China as a calendar. It’s too bad he didn’tleave it at that. If so, he would have received kudos from a small coterie ofChinese scholars and very little notice beyond those circles. Instead heasserted that he’d discovered a map, not only of history, or limited to earth,but of time itself.Here we have to remind ourselves again that, at some deep level, Terence neverreally escaped the legacy of his Western, Christian past: the existential horrorof being trapped in history, trapped in time. As he noted of the timewave in TheEvolutionary Mind (1998), a collection of his conversations with RupertSheldrake and Ralph Abraham, “This idea is basically Catholicism with the chromestripped off. It restates Teilhard de Chardin’s idea of the Omega Point, theTelos attracting and drawing history into itself.”In the course of doing so, he introduced another crucial flaw: He took anancient, cyclical, Chinese calendar and made it linear. He did this by declaringtime “fractal”—which means, on close inspection, short spans of time arerevealed to be “microversions of the larger patterns in which they areembedded.” What’s more, his model of time became an ever-tightening spiral thathad to have a beginning and an end. Built into its structure was the notion thatnovelty would eventually reach a critical point where the wave collapses,presumably at the instant of an Ultimate Novel Event, whatever that might be.Some call this moment the “singularity,” but this is a vague and perhapsmisleading term. The concept implies that at some point we’ll cross a thresholdwhere all of our assumptions—about causality, time, space, and virtuallyeverything else—will no longer apply. The singularity could be just aboutanything, so the term is not that helpful in predicting what it might entail.There was no reason why Terence’s timewave had to end; I see this as simply anexpression of his acute longing for an escape from history, an escape fromdeath. But once it had an end, the question became where the end should be. Muchof the controversy over the timewave dealt with how to fit it to events in thepast, which in effect would lock it to an end date in the future. That guessinggame posed a dilemma: The end had to occur in our lifetimes so we could witnessit; if not, what was the point? But it couldn’t be too soon, because thepostulated grand finale might come and go, compromising the predictive value ofthe timewave (which happened several times over the years). What’s more, theevent should ideally be linked to some other widely anticipated historical orcosmic transition, and few were better than a date near the solstice in December2012, the so-called “end” of the Maya calendar.As I understand it, such an event would be either a mass disaster or a morehopeful awakening of some sort—but always on a global scale. Examples range frombenevolent aliens showing up in their mile-wide ships to help us get our acttogether (as in Childhood’s End), or a wrathful Jesus arriving by golden chariotto smite the wicked and beam up the righteous for an eternity of harp playingand bingo. Perhaps the embryonic artificial intelligence lurking in the Internetwill suddenly cross the threshold into self-awareness and realize, in threenanoseconds, that we’re the creatures screwing things up, a problem solvedeasily enough by causing the world’s nuclear reactors to melt down whilelaunching the world’s entire nuclear arsenal. All these events would certainlybe dramatic and novel enough to validate the timewave if they occurred anywherenear the postulated end date. But no event of that magnitude is likely tohappen.Terence’s selection of the timewave’s end date did not hinge on seriousmathematical analysis. His theory and the Maya calendar have nothing to do witheach other, the delusions of the current zeitgeist notwithstanding. While mostcredible Mayanists agree that the Maya did have a calendar that ends, so tospeak, on the winter solstice in 2012, there’s little evidence the day wasimbued with great significance. The end of that cycle—known as the LongCount—may simply have marked the start of a new one. According to variousscholars, efforts to associate that date with a doomsday event are baseless andself-serving.The ancient Maya actually tracked several calendrical cycles. One was a 365-daycalendar called the haab’. Another was the tzolk’in, a 260-day sacred calendarbased on a series of thirteen periods, each twenty days long. Those systemsaligned on a specific date once every fifty-two years, thus delineating a thirdunit of time called the Calendar Round. To chronicle longer periods, the Mayaand other Mesoamerican cultures relied on the Long Count mentioned above.According to Western calendars, the Long Count began on a late summer day in3114 b.c.e., marking the start of the human epoch. Certain Maya texts suggestthere were earlier pre-human “worlds” of long duration before the gods got itright. And there would be other worlds afterward. For whatever reason, the Mayadesigned these epochs, including the Long Count, to consist of thirteenb’ak’tuns, each 144,000 days in length. According to the math, we are, as Iwrite, somewhere very near the end of that 5,125-year period, and thus very nearthe start of the next.In other words, just as Terence based the origin of the timewave on an ancient,cyclical Chinese calendar, so he tied its end to an ancient, cyclical Mayacalendar. It appears the timewave tells us much more about him, in some sense,than it does about time. His deep-seated longing to escape time and history isone he shared with millions. Every life has a beginning and an end; we arepushed along inexorably by time from the moment we are born to the moment theplug is pulled and the sheet is drawn up. Nobody has ever escaped from time,though all of the world’s religions are scams predicated on the notion that wecan. We all confront our own singularity at the end of time, the end of our ownpersonal history. This is the only eschaton we can realistically look forwardto. No one can say, definitively, what happens to consciousness beyond thatthreshold, whether it is extinguished forever or translates into some sort ofvirtual reality, whatever that means when we’re talking about life after death.Someday, we may understand this. Someday, technology may advance to a pointwhere it’s possible to consider uploading one’s consciousness or “soul”(whatever that is) into some kind of virtual environment maintained bysupercomputer networks that are vastly more powerful than anything we havetoday. If that day ever arrives, it will mark the collapse of all of the world’sreligions, an unintended consequence that I, for one, would relish.Until that day, here we are, trapped in our own personal history, which in turnis nested in human history, and that in turn is embedded in biological,evolutionary, geological, and cosmological history. Beyond the personal level,history won’t end today, or tomorrow, or on a date in late December 2012. Thetimewave’s point of “maximal” novelty is destined to come and go—as for manyreaders, surely, it already has—reduced to one of those quirky wrap-up piecesdelivered on the nightly news. There will be no celestial chariots or mile-wideships, no massive asteroid impact or volcanic eruption, no gamma-ray burst froma distant supernova that wipes out ninety-nine percent of earthly life. Suchevents could happen, I suppose, but I don’t believe they can be predicted. Withthe rare exceptions of global natural catastrophes that occur every few millionyears, novelty works more locally and slowly than these scenarios would have usbelieve.Whatever the predicted end date, we’ll wake up the next day facing the sameintractable woes we faced the day before. Rather than confront those challenges,however, many of us will choose to focus our hope and dread on a new zero pointahead, longing for some resolution to our dilemma, some final outcome no matterhow catastrophic. Strange, perhaps, but we are a species so adept at denial thateven a vision of the apocalypse is a welcome distraction from the thought ofdevoting ourselves to making the time we are afforded the best it can possiblybe.I’ve been hard here on Terence’s concept from a scientific perspective, partlybecause he spoke of it in scientific terms, imagined it could be calibrated withscientific precision, and invited scientific minds to critique it. That said,I’m keenly aware that the timewave has a value and beauty that lies outside thegrasp of science. Does it describe the structure of time itself, as Terencepostulated? I doubt it. But in the tantalizing way of astrologicalcorrespondences and the I Ching itself, the timewave does seem to describesomething about the world, something significant and yet impossible to define.The element of subjectivity is so intrinsic to interpreting these constructsthat one can read into them whatever one wants to find. Somehow, paradoxically,that suggests both their fatal flaw and their mysterious power as mirrors of thehidden self.There’s yet another way of looking at the timewave, I realize—one in which itspredicted end time is already upon us. The rate of change in global events,environmental decline, and technological advance gives every sign of speedingup. Even as things seem to be falling apart faster than ever, there aredevelopments that could lead the era through the historical bottleneck thatappears to loom just ahead. It is a race between the forces of entropy and chaosand those of order, evolution, and progress.Come to think of it, maybe that has always been so; perhaps our age is not asunique as we might like to believe. It’s very hard to discern the nature of thepresent, let alone to envision the future. Terence’s gift may not have been theability to predict what events would undergo the formality of actuallyoccurring, but to understand before most of us which ones already had. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 37 - To See the Great Man Once Terence and I had finished the manuscript for The Invisible Landscape inthe early fall of 1974, we drifted apart again. After a year in the Bay Area, Iwas tired of my restaurant job and craving an adventure, away from Terence andhis influence. On some level, I think, he was still concerned about mystability, as yet not fully trusting me not to spin off again into madness ordelusion. He was playing dual roles as elder brother and, in some respects, asfather. His concerns were sincere, but I had to push back. I was also beginningto think about what I should do with my life. Eager to get out of Berkeley, Ihatched a plan.In those days, Greyhound offered a bus ticket for sixty dollars, I believe, thatlet you travel for sixty days anywhere along their routes in the United Statesand Canada. It was a great way to see the country, provided you could stand thatmuch bus riding. Having saved some money from my restaurant work, I took thatand some of my book advance and headed out.My ultimate intention was “to see the great man” as the I Ching would haveit—that is, to approach a figure with the wisdom and authority to change mylife. In seeking out the master, the student isn’t waiting for novelty to makeits entrance, but inviting and even taunting it to do so. The benefits can betremendous, but there is always an implicit danger as well. I hadn’t forgottenmy brother’s encounter with Gunther Stent.In my case, the great man was Richard Evans Schultes, the famous ethnobotanistat Harvard, director of its Botanical Museum and the world’s expert onhallucinogenic plants. As I mentioned, it was his leaflet on “Virola as anOrally Administered Hallucinogen,” that had lured us to La Chorrera, looking forthe obscure Witoto hallucinogen oo-koo-hé. La Chorrera was the ancestral home ofthe Witotos, and Schultes had made important collections there. In addition tomeeting Schultes, I wanted to ask him if there might be a chance I could pursuegraduate studies under him.My roundabout route began with a detour for visionary purposes. In the three anda half years since my return from La Chorrera, I’d almost entirely avoidedpsychedelics. I had one experience with peyote that went well and revealed nosigns of a lurking proclivity to psychosis. I felt it was time to reconnect withthe mushroom mind. By then it was known that Psilocybe cubensis was not onlyabundant in South America but also fairly common throughout the southern UnitedStates, found just about anywhere there were cattle and pastures. As ithappened, some former acquaintances in Boulder had recently moved to Hammond,Louisiana and opened a hippie leather and crafts shop. They had rented a littlehouse outside of town near a pasture that should have been prime mushroomhabitat. Assured there would be mushrooms and a place to stay, I headed toHammond. That fall had been dry and the crop was sparse, but I found enough toingest several times, and that proved a good reintroduction to my fungalfriends. The shrooms there were much weaker than those at La Chorrera, which wasa lucky accident; the gentle trips were a good way to ease back into thatdimension.After a week or so in Hammond, I rode on to Richmond, Virginia, where I visiteda linguist who at the time was perhaps the only non-native speaker of Yanomaman,the language spoken by the Yanomami peoples of the Amazon along theVenuezuelan-Brazilian border. In our correspondence, he told me he had severalsamples of epená, the DMT-containing Virola snuff used by the Yanomami. I wasmore interested in the drug than the people, unfortunately, but my hostgenerously shared his collections. Years later, I was able to include them inthe analytical work on Virola that I carried out as part of my doctoral thesiswork.From there I headed for Boston and my meeting with Schultes. I arrived inCambridge on a sweltering afternoon and went immediately to Harvard Square andthe Botanical Museum. I cleared the receptionist in the lobby and was usheredupstairs to the office of the great man himself.The door was ajar, the shades within closed against the afternoon glare. Peeringinto the gloom I couldn’t see anyone at first. Then my eyes adjusted and Icaught sight of him toward the back of the room. Clad in a white lab coat, hewas literally hugging an air conditioner in one of the windows! It was mostincongruous to see this swashbuckling, legendary figure, now portly andmiddle-aged, snuggled up to his air conditioner. The afternoon was terribly hotin the way that only late Indian summer days can be, and I hardly blamed him. Iwas charmed, in fact, to see this display of vulnerability. Apparently even thegreat jungle botanist enjoyed his creature comforts when he had them.Noticing me, he came forward and introduced himself. We had corresponded so myvisit was more or less expected, but we hadn’t set a time. Schultes waseverything I had hoped he would be; he was completely charming and kind, everybit the fatherly mentor. How many other bearded, bedraggled hippies had madethis pilgrimage? I was surely one in a long line. For anyone with my level ofinterest in hallucinogenic plants, Schultes was a luminary, and meeting him wasan unparalleled honor. I was disheveled and sweaty from my walk from the busstation. I had been on the bus for days and probably smelled like it, but ifthat bothered him he didn’t let on. Having greeted me as a colleague and equal,he shut up his office and took me to dinner at the Harvard Faculty Club.Along with his pioneering collections in the Amazon, Schultes was known for thediverse and talented cadre of students he attracted. One of them was Wade Davis,today a well-known ethnobotanist, writer, and “explorer-in-residence” at theNational Geographic Society. While I was chatting with the professor in hisoffice, Davis was traveling in South America with Tim Plowman, another Schultesprotégé, researching coca, the plant from which cocaine is derived. Davis wouldlater write about their long journey in One River: Explorations and Discoveriesin the Amazon Rain Forest (1996), a book that features affectionate portraits ofPlowman, a brilliant ethnobotanist destined to die young, and the mentor theyshared in Schultes. As Davis notes of the latter, “At any one time he hadstudents flung all across Latin America seeking new fruits from the forest,obscure oil palms from the swamps of the Orinoco, rare tuber crops from the highAndes.” Schultes had a remarkable influence on the young people who, in hislater years, became his eyes and legs in the field. As Davis observes ofSchultes’s letters, “It was impossible to read them without hearing his resonantvoice, without feeling a surge of confidence and purpose, often strangely atodds with the esoteric character of the immediate assignments.”I felt something like that in his presence at Harvard. We spent the afternoondiscussing our mutual interests, and my ambition to study under him and perhapsfurther investigate Virola. My spotty academic record came up; I had taken somebasic botany courses, plant morphology, and taxonomy of the angiosperms, butpractically no chemistry. He advised me I needed to get organic chemistry undermy belt, and maybe more taxonomy, in order to qualify for admission to graduateschool. If I could do that, he said, he thought I could probably be accepted,and he assured me he’d try to facilitate my application. I left the meetingfired with ambition, utterly stoked and ready to do whatever it took to workwith him.My friend Beverly and I spent time together over the next few days touring thecity’s museums and art galleries. It was a great reunion, a renewal of ourfriendship after its rocky chapter in Boulder. I got back on the bus and stoppedin Ann Arbor for a day to rest and check out some bookstores, then headed forVancouver. Though bus travel could be grueling, I had a secret that made it notonly tolerable but pleasant: a stash of hashish-tobacco cigarettes I’dpre-rolled and disguised to look like ordinary cigarettes. The buses were nevercrowded, so it was easy to stake out a couple of seats toward the back. I’d bidemy time until well after midnight when most of the passengers were asleep andthen discretely light up. The ventilation system wafted away the smoke, whichsmelled mostly like tobacco in any case. Or so I told myself, enjoying mythoughts, and my visions of a new future as the bus cruised through the velvetdarkness after midnight.I arrived in Vancouver just in time for a Grateful Dead concert, stayed withfriends for a few days, and then made it to Berkeley in time for Thanksgiving.But that was just another stop along the way. Schultes had helped me define amission. I was bound for Colorado and determined to get back in school.My plan was to live in Boulder, but I ended up at Colorado State University inFort Collins, where a friend had a job tending the horticulture greenhouse. Ifound an apartment in the building where he lived and registered for the nextsemester. I took two classes: one in “grass systematics,” a taxonomy course thathad me struggling a bit with the arcane keys used to identify various species;the other in introductory organic chemistry, which I loved. The professor of thesecond, Frank Stermitz, turned out to be a natural products chemist specializingin alkaloids and a gifted teacher. I remember him illustrating a lecture with alook at LSD, comparing synthetic production to the biosynthetic route in theergot fungus. Needless to say, I was rapt. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 38 - Fun with Fungi: 1975 [images/00038.jpg]> Cover of the Grower’s Guide, first edition, 1976. (Photo by J. Bigwood) The move back to Fort Collins was a first step in the new direction I hadembarked on after my pilgrimage to see Schultes. I had separated, again, from alife near Terence and begun charting a new career. But my brother and I stillhad an important bit of business inspired by the Teacher we’d yet to finish:figuring out how to cultivate the mushrooms. We wanted to have a steady supplyso we could easily revisit those dimensions; more importantly, we wanted othersto have their own experiences as a way of testing ours. At La Chorrera, we hadcollected spore prints from the mushrooms. Later, in Boulder, we made efforts togerminate the spores and grow mycelia on petri plates. We didn’t know what wewere doing and had little success, but we hadn’t given up.By the spring of 1975, we weren’t the only ones who were interested indeveloping this piece of psychedelic technology. A fellow student I’ll call Markhad access to the agronomy department’s tissue culture lab, and he became anenthusiastic collaborator. We managed to get some spores germinated and weregrowing mycelial cultures on potato dextrose agar in the lab; that was the easypart. We still hadn’t gotten them to fruit—that is, to form mushrooms. Then Istumbled on a paper in the journal Mycologia that described a simple method forgrowing fruiting bodies of the common edible mushroom Agaricus bisporus incanning jars, on a substrate of sterilized rye grain (San Antonio 1971). Thoughnot a practical method for large-scale cultivation, it was presented as a way togrow a few fruiting bodies for use in genetic studies. We could have cared lessabout that; it looked like it just might work for Psilocybe cubensis.We lost no time in sterilizing a batch of canning jars. The mycelium grewrapidly and permeated the substrate within a few days. After that, we removedthe lids and “cased” the jars with a layer of sterilized peat moss andvermiculite. I then took the jars back home so I could spray them every day andlook after them. Ten days passed. Nothing happened. The mycelium appeared to begrowing through the casing soil and spreading on the top of it. Not good. Iadded more soil and kept watching. Five more days: nothing. I was disappointedto say the least. One night I came home and took a look at the jars as I hadbeen doing every day, and still saw nothing.It was my friend in the building who noticed first: along the side of the jar,squashed between the mycelial block and the glass, was a little penis-shapedstructure, an elongated white stem topped with a rounded, dark brown tip. Amushroom primordium! Excitedly, we checked the other jars, and they all hadthem. Over the next few days, they broke through the surface and expanded intobeautiful, golden-capped mushrooms. They were also quite adequately strong, aswe soon learned. By this time, even the uncased mycelial blocks that Mark hadkept in the lab were producing fruits, as I discovered the next day when I foundhim there bent over in uncontrollable laughter. There was every reason to behappy, even without the assistance of psilocybin. This changed everything.Those familiar with Terence’s talents as a raconteur won’t be shocked to learnhe could be an unreliable narrator at times. And with respect to his account ofhow we perfected our mushroom-growing method, as noted in True Hallucinationsamong other places, I have some debunking to do. According to Terence, he’d beenconducting his trials in the shed at the lower end of his garden in Berkeley.He’d tried growing the mycelium on beds of sterilized rye and manure-compostmixes without success. Finally, in frustration, he closed up the shed and wentaway for a couple of weeks. Upon his return, he threw open the shed door andfound the beds were covered with large, beautiful clusters of mushrooms.Great story, but our discovery occurred as I’ve explained it above. Here’s theabstract: Working in the tissue culture lab over several weeks, Mark and Isucceeded in establishing mycelial cultures. Then we stumbled across the paperfrom Mycologia. We applied the method described there, and it worked.I immediately shared the method with Terence, who also had success. Thetechnique was tricky at first, but once we knew its quirks, growing mushrooms inmason jars on blocks of sterilized rye grain was quite easy. In Psilocybin:Magic Mushroom Grower’s Guide, we described our method as about as complex as aseventh-grade science fair project. It would be almost another year before wetried growing mushrooms on composted beds, in a manner akin to what Terencedescribed, but even then we had little luck, as I’ll relate.Nevertheless, the jar method was a major breakthrough. We considered it furthervalidation of the gnosis that had been given to us at La Chorrera, now that wewere in full symbiotic allegiance with the mushroom. The Teacher had intimatedthat we’d be given the knowledge of a technology that violated no physical laws,but which we’d understand to have verified its teachings. Clearly, this simplemethodology was what the Teacher meant. And we used our book to convey thatknowledge to thousands of others around the globe. After Psilocybin waspublished, anyone could produce a pure, natural, potent psychedelic usingmaterials largely available at the grocery store. Any college student with aspare closet could now produce magic mushrooms in modest quantities and givethem to friends. It really was another psychedelic revolution, of a quieterkind.We published Psilocybin under pseudonyms; only years later was it widely knownthat O.T. Oss and O. N. Oeric were Terence and Dennis McKenna, respectively. Inmany respects, I regard that book as our most significant accomplishment. Itcontinues to have a positive cultural impact, that is, if you believe themushrooms and their influence are good, as I do. More than our wild ideas andtheories, which may well be flawed and destined to be forgotten, we can claim amodest credit for the role we played in implementing a global symbiosis with themushrooms. Even in the years after Wasson’s article in Life on the mushroomcults of Mexico, the experience remained the secret knowledge of a few. Nowmillions have experienced the mushrooms and the dimensions they open toexploration.Shortly after we had developed our new method, I finished my courses at CSU andmoved, temporarily, to a small house in the Big Thompson River canyon justoutside Loveland, Colorado. I had a great day job at a wheat genetics lab a fewmiles away, and plenty of spare time at home to set up and experiment with somejars. Back at CSU, I’d had a work-study job as an assistant to an art professor.During that time, many of the art students became my good friends. I rememberthe lovely experience we had when some of them visited Loveland and we all gotquite loaded in a sunny glade in the aspen forest a few miles up the canyon.My Loveland interlude was short-lived, and perhaps luckily so. I stayed in thehouse on the Big Thompson through the end of July. A year later, on July 31,1976, torrential summer rains swept down the canyon and engulfed my formerquarters during what proved to be one of the worst flood disasters in Coloradohistory. Among the 143 fatalities were my landlord (who lived up the road) andmy next-door neighbor and her adult, mentally disabled son.Earlier in my Loveland summer, I had gotten the final word on my application tostudy under Schultes at Harvard. Though I’d taken his advice on how to improvemy chances by studying chemistry and taxonomy, I hadn’t been accepted.Fortunately, the refusal did not end my friendship with him, and I hadopportunities to spend time with him in later years, and to earn his respect formy eventual achievements. To be honest, I wasn’t terribly disappointed by therejection. With the new technology we now had at our disposal, I was actuallyleaning toward mycology and getting less interested in the taxonomy of higherplants.After my Loveland interlude, I returned to California. I bought an old car for$100 and set out for the West Coast. I put my best mycelial cultures onto slantsand stuffed them into a styrofoam box, which sat on the front seat beside me. Mycar wasn’t up to the freeways, so I mostly stayed on U.S. Route 50, billed asthe “Loneliest Highway in the World.” The road lived up to its reputation, butat least I had the company of my fungal symbionts, quiet though they were. I arrived in the Bay Area to a scene that had radically changed. Ev and Terencehad broken up, spectacularly, after she’d started sleeping with a friend ofTerence’s who had helped him with the timewave software. Terence had alreadymoved to Oakland and had started a relationship with Kat, the woman he’d latermarry. Kat had grown up in the town of Avalon on Santa Catalina Island off thecoast southwest of Los Angeles. Like Terence, she had traveled widely in thelate sixties; the two had apparently first met in Jerusalem and reconnectedyears later. Kat was smart, pretty, and fun to be around; she and my brothermade a good match. Only half in jest, I tried to warn her that Terence could bedifficult. For his part, he’d turned up the charm and ripped the knob off.Our first project was to complete Psilocybin, which had been accepted by a smalllocal publisher, And/Or Press. We finished the entire manuscript in under amonth and saw it published early in 1976. I wrote the technical parts, andTerence provided the foreword, including the well-known set piece I excerptedearlier, “The Mushroom Speaks.”Over those weeks, Kat and Terence had been planning a move to Hawaii, which theydid in October. I first traveled to Hawaii in December 1975 to spend theholidays with them on the Big Island. Their rented house was small, but the landbehind it looked ideal for a little experiment in outdoor mushroom cultivation.I arrived only a few days after they’d had a brush with the dark side of themushroom experience, as described by Terence in True Hallucinations. Mushroomsare not always about giddiness and giggles; they can hint at, even starklyreveal, certain alien dimensions otherwise closed to the mind. Terence and Kathad been sobered by their encounter with that darker aspect and were in no hurryto repeat it.Meanwhile, a journey was in the works. We had all been impressed by a bookcalled Wizard of the Upper Amazon by F. Bruce Lamb, an account of the life of anayahuasquero named Manuel Córdova-Rios. Rumor had it that Córdova-Rios was stillalive and living in Iquitos, Peru. Enticed by his story, Terence and Kat hadbegun planning a trip to Iquitos to find him, and to investigate ayahuasca. Idecide to stay in their place while Terence and Kat took off in search oflegendary shamans and magic decoctions.By late winter 1976, I had moved to Hawaii and Terence was headed for Peru.There was something slapdash about their adventure, though as one who sharedtheir wanderlust, especially for South America, I understood the allure. As itturned out, their travels would later help me in ways I could not have foreseen.Terence and Kat did contact Córdova-Rios, who, as Terence writes in The ArchaicRevival, was by then in his early nineties, his eyes clouded by cataracts. Hesaid the ayahuasqueros around Iquitos were mostly charlatans and suggested thatTerence and Kat move their search to Pucallpa instead. Taking his advice, theymet a practitioner there who would later assist me at the start of myprofessional life, in 1981.I’d applied to the graduate program in the botany department at the Universityof Hawaii at Manoa, on the island of Oahu, and had been accepted for the fallterm in 1976. The idea of living on the Big Island for a few months seemed likean attractive prospect. I ended up enjoying the solitude, even if our dabblingin outdoor fungiculture never panned out. I left that place and flew to Honoluluin early June, loaded what little stuff I had in a rented beater, and racedaround for a couple of days, looking for a place to live. I finally found astudio apartment just a few blocks from the University of Hawaii campus andmoved in, along with my All-American canning pressure cooker, an essential toolfor sterilizing cultures. My next-door neighbor introduced me to friends of hiswho lived in a communal student house nearby. They were nice hippies, fellowpsychedelic enthusiasts who shared my appreciation for the abundance of theautumn harvest. Before long, I began to think of Hawaii as my home. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 39 - A Lab in Paradise Shortly before classes started, I got a letter, forwarded from Colorado, from myformer girlfriend Deborah. After years of living with the surfer in Florida,she’d married him, given birth to a daughter, and moved back to California. Foolthat I was, the letter gave me a flicker of hope. She clearly wasn’t very happy;maybe we could see each other again.But I was too busy with the start of graduate school even to dwell on past love.I had been offered a research assistantship by the botany department fundedthrough the U.S. Forest Service. This was a break; it meant I could focus onresearch and did not have to work as a teaching assistant. My grantors didn’tcare what I worked on, they said, as long as it was Hawaiian and as long as itwas a tree!I knew nothing about Hawaiian flora at the time except that Acacia koa and someof its close relatives were important trees on the islands. I knew that some ofthe African and Australian Acacia species had high levels of DMT and othertryptamines, also beta-carbolines, in the bark and leaves. It was perfect! Ithought I could study the tryptamine chemistry of the indigenous Hawaiian Acaciaspecies; I’d compare the alkaloid profiles among them and see if those compoundscould be used as chemotaxonomic markers. The possibility that they might alsoyield significant quantities of DMT would be another, if unstated, researchgoal.The only problem, I soon discovered, was that the Hawaiian Acacia species areall notable for their lack of alkaloids. Like many indigenous island plants,they had long since lost the need to produce protective secondary products likealkaloids, having few predators. Instead, I focused on the non-protein aminoacids and phenolics, which were abundant in the Hawaiian Acacias. I ended upcomparing these profiles among different island populations, and also with someof the closely related Australian Acacia species (which did containtryptamines).It didn’t really matter. It was a good, challenging project that enabled me tolearn hands-on plant chemistry and how to conduct myself in the lab. Eventually,I got a master’s degree out of that work, though none of my findings werepublished in a journal, much to the disappointment of my original supervisor,who had secured the forestry grant that funded my research assistantship.As it happened, I ended up working more closely with another professor, SanfordSiegel, Ph.D., who eventually became my research supervisor, mentor, and friend.Siegel was one of the most remarkable people I have ever known. He was truly aRenaissance man and a brilliant and creative scientist. I had seen in theliterature that arrived with my acceptance notice that among the faculty was oneSanford Siegel, whose research interests, among many things, was exobiology, thestudy of extraterrestrial life. What? How could anyone study that, since therewas none available to study, mushrooms notwithstanding? I had to meet this guy.A couple of weeks before the semester began, I visited the department just tonose around and see who was there. That was the mid-seventies, the era of the“energy crisis,” and the corridor lights were dimmed. I approached anodd-looking, rumpled character in the gloom, and asked if he knew where I couldfind Dr. Siegel. He peered at me myopically through thick glasses and quietlyreplied that he was Dr. Siegel. He looked like a gnome, short and quite round.He invited me into his office, and we chatted. It quickly became clear that wewere on the same wavelength. For one thing, we both loved science fiction. Foranother, we shared this interest in extraterrestrial life, chemistry, andpharmacology. He had never had experience with psychedelics, but when Imentioned them he didn’t freak out like so many in his generation might havedone. I queried him about his research, and it turned out that he was, amongmany things, an environmental toxicologist who studied “stress physiology” inplants (and animals) and extreme environments.That was the exobiology angle; he had grants from NASA to study the effect ofsimulated extraterrestrial conditions on earth organisms, to determine theenvironmental parameters under which they could survive. He also studied mercurycycling in the environment, which explained what he was doing in Hawaii. Thevolcanoes spew forth megatons of mercury in numerous chemical forms, and manyorganisms—such as those that inhabit volcanic steam vents—have adapted to itspresence and can tolerate extremely high levels of the metal. He was usingsatellite vegetation mapping technology to chart the distribution ofmercury-tolerant species, and thereby locate volcanic vents, which are potentialsources of geothermal energy.In his NASA-funded work, he was extremely creative in his thinking about stressphysiology and extreme environments. For example, he wondered what would happenif he tried to grow a cactus underwater. Turns out it grows fine as long as yoububble oxygen and carbon dioxide through the water. How well does a tarantulasurvive under a radiation flux similar to that at the Martian surface? Itsurvives just fine, for months. Can you germinate onion seedlings in liquidammonia as a substitute for water? Yes, ammonia can substitute for water in manybiological processes. He had a genius for thinking up these incredibly creative,exciting, simple experiments. And yet they all had a rationale and a reasonbehind them. He was an out-of-the-box thinker.Sandy was like a father to me, my scientific father. I loved the guy. And heloved me, too; really, he loved all of his students. Whenever an interestingprofessor came to town, Siegel would invite all the grad students up to hishouse in Manoa for pizza and beer, and we’d spend the evening having the mostfascinating conversations. His wife, Bobbie, was also a scientist and abrilliant microbiologist; they had one of those science-based marriages likePierre and Marie Curie. Those of us who were part of Sandy’s circle calledourselves “Siegel-Lab.” One of the marks of a truly great mind, in my opinion,is they tend to love teaching, and Sandy did.Through Sandy I met a number of gifted students who became my close friends.Maggie, for instance, eventually became a well-funded, highly publishedprofessor. Her work had something to do with the regulation of the cell cycle,most of it so complicated I couldn’t understand it, and still can’t. She playedin a bluegrass band that performed every weekend at a roadhouse in Ewa Beach,which for many of us became the focus of our grad-school social lives. Anothernew friend, Lani, was a winsome island girl with long blonde hair. She was anexcellent taxonomist, knew all of the Hawaiian plants, and was clearly on trackto carry on the legacy of Harold St. John, the former botany professor afterwhom the plant-sciences building had been named. Lani died of lymphoma in thelate 1990s. I was saddened to lose a friend and respected colleague when she wasstill so young.I discovered Lani’s remarkable knowledge of local plants, and my lack thereof,shortly after the semester started. I was thrilled to have a bench in Siegel’slab, with the tools of basic phytochemistry at my fingertips: a thin-layerchromatography apparatus, extraction vessels, and rotary evaporators. What Ilacked was expertise. One afternoon I took a break to walk down the hill to thebank a few blocks away. When I stepped out of the bank I was struck by a strong,almost overpowering smell of DMT! As I walked back up the hill the odor becamestronger. Finally, I came to its source: a small tree in full flower on the mainmall of the campus. Excitedly, I collected an armload of flowers, leaves, andtwigs, indifferent to the fact that I was vandalizing one of the university’sornamental trees. Back in the lab, I started grinding up the various plantparts, putting them into alcohol, bound for the shaker to extract. I was sure Ihad found the DMT mother lode until a moment later when Lani walked in, pickedup a flowering branch and said something like, “Oh, I see you’ve found Sterculiafoetida! Really stinks, doesn’t it?”Well, at least I had a name, but I still thought it might be DMT. Subsequentanalysis proved otherwise. As it turns out, Sterculia foetida does haveinteresting chemistry, namely a group of unusual cyclopropene-containing lipidsthat have marked anti-inflammatory activity. These would be volatile and highlyaromatic but not hallucinogenic. A few weeks into the semester, I moved out of my tiny apartment near the campusto a bigger place in Nu’uanu Valley, where I stayed less than a year. Onenotable thing about that time was that it coincided with, if not the end, atleast the beginning of the end of the two romantic attachments that had definedmy early adulthood. The first was with Peggy, who was still living in Boulder.Having enrolled in a nursing program, she was going through her own set ofpersonal and academic challenges. Her boyfriend from a few years back was longgone. She was lonely, and I was still in love with her, having come to acceptboth my feelings and their futility as a chronic condition. Without reallyexpecting anything, I offered to send her a ticket to come visit. I wassurprised—overjoyed, actually—when she accepted. Maybe after all that pain andheartache, love longed for and lost, we’d actually get together.Peggy flew out, and we went to the Big Island for a few days. We stayed in thecabins at Mauna Kea State Park, on the flanks of the volcano that is Hawaii’shighest point, and took some mushrooms up there. Our trip together wasexcellent, our lovemaking less so; it just didn’t seem to have the passion thatI had long imagined it would. It was not her fault, or mine, really. There wasjust no spark. She was beautiful and I lusted for her, but afterward I had toadmit we just couldn’t be comfortable together. It was not the end of ourfriendship, but, more importantly, it wasn’t the beginning of the relationship Ihad desired for so long. Peggy went back to the mainland with a cloud ofambivalence and uncertainty hanging over us, and I slipped into a funk. I hadinteresting work and a circle of nice friends, but no one to love.Terence and Kat had returned from their trip to Peru earlier that year andsettled in California. I traveled there in November for their Thanksgivingweekend wedding. I had another agenda, one I could trace back partly to mydisappointing visit with Peggy, but more to that forwarded letter I’d gottenmonths earlier from Deborah. Married and a mother though she was, I decided tovisit her. It was an utterly stupid thing to do. I didn’t know what was going tohappen, but I knew what I wanted to happen; I wanted Deborah to leave the surferand come live with me in Hawaii—an unrealistic hope, and a selfish one to boot.I knew from our correspondence that she wanted to see me, and so I went.When I arrived, I found her husband to be remarkably cordial, considering thesituation. Then again, I was supposedly visiting there as a friend. He wasbarely out of the driveway on his way to his night job before Deborah and I werelocked in passionate embrace.There was a big scene when he got home. Deborah told him she no longer wanted tobe married and no longer loved him; she wanted to be with me. The poor guy hadbeen blindsided. Our mushroom grower’s guide had just been published, and I’dbrought a copy for Deborah. Her husband saw it and threatened to call the cops.I fled in horror and anger, leaving a wrecked if formerly unhappy marriagebehind me. It was a shameful, rotten thing to do; there was no excuse for it.Deborah was foolish and selfish, but I was no less so. Many times I haveregretted my role in their breakup.Within a year, Deborah was divorced and struggling financially. We believed wewere in love again and would be together soon. This long-distance relationship,rekindled by a betrayal and sustained by a delusion, went on for nearly a year.During that time, Deborah got involved with another man, a guy who, ironically,was growing mushrooms using our newly published method. Deborah wasn’t a personwho had much self-reliance or who could be centered within herself. I should nothave been surprised that she couldn’t remain “true” to me, whatever that meantin such circumstances. I tried to be sanguine about this new turn of affairs,still convinced that if we could be together for a while we’d rediscover thelove we’d shared before.Finally, she planned a visit in August 1977. She and her ex-husband sharedcustody of their young daughter; he amicably agreed to look after the child forthe two weeks Deborah planned to spend with me. Reflecting on this, I’d say hewas either a saint or a fool or possibly both; he certainly reacted to thesituation with a lot of maturity. I was beside myself with hope and desire as Icounted down the days until her arrival.Early on the morning Deborah was supposed to arrive, she called to say that shewouldn’t be coming after all. She’d thought it over, she said, and arelationship between us just couldn’t happen. She needed to live where herdaughter could be close to her father. I was devastated. We had words, and in myanger I said hurtful things. She responded in kind. It was the last conversationwe ever had.It took me a long time to get over that call. At first I became profoundlydepressed. I seriously contemplated suicide. Life had no meaning for me. I datedmany women, almost in rebellion for what had happened, but I was in no shape tostart a meaningful relationship. Perhaps a trace of such anguish lingers, ofcourse, but I do not blame Deborah for any of it now. She did the right thing.Her daughter needed a father as well as a mother, and though I was ready toaccept her daughter as part of a family of our own, that would not have been thesame.I first came to realize that nearly two years later. I had taken a very highdose of mushrooms, by myself and for no particular reason. It was the best thingI could have done. I understood, with their help, that Deborah really had nochoice but to do what she had done. She hadn’t wanted to hurt me, but I’d backedher into a corner and something had to give. Grasping that, finally, I couldhardly blame her for what had happened. Not that she needed forgiveness, but Idid forgive her, and I forgave myself. It was one of the most therapeuticpsychedelic experiences I’ve ever had. After that, the clouds lifted on mygloomy mood and I became much more the cheerful person I was, and still am. WhenI think of Deborah now, it isn’t with anger, but with love.The voice of the mushroom is not always so healing, let alone reliable, as anepisode shortly after my breakup with Deborah revealed. In the worst of mygrief, I thought it might be good to do exactly what I later did sousefully—spend some time alone and take some mushrooms. I put a few things in apack and flew into Hilo on the Big Island and rented a car. I spent a night atthe park at Laupahoehoe on the windward side, but it poured the entire time. Ichecked out the park at Mauna Kea, but it was rainy and chilly there, too, so Idrove down the island’s leeward, drier side to Spencer Beach, a favorite touristspot near Kawaihae.That’s where I met Brad and Kris. Blackjack dealers at a big casino in LasVegas, they were camping their way around the Big Island over an offseasonbreak. They seemed friendly and normal enough, and after talking for a whilethey asked me if I knew where to get some acid. No, I said, but I did have someshrooms. Before long we were talking about finding a spot to take them. As ithappened, I had the perfect place in mind. Earlier that year, Terence and Kathad briefly visited the island and acquired a parcel of land on the Kona side.There were as yet no structures on the property, which could only be reached byfour-wheel drive up a dreadful road. No one lived nearby, so we wouldn’t bedisturbed, and the couple’s rental vehicle could handle the track.By dusk, we’d pitched our tents on the empty land and were ready for themushroom soup that had been simmering on the fire. Kris called it “blue soup”because of the blue color imparted by oxidation of the psilocin in it. I’d putall the mushrooms I’d brought into the soup, and we split it three ways. Itdidn’t take long before the effects began to manifest, and they seemedincredibly strong. I hadn’t eaten anything since breakfast, and I figured thatwas the reason. We smoked a little weed to mellow things out. Kris began tellingme about her misadventures in Las Vegas, the time she’d dropped acid on thestrip and ended up naked and raving in the local police station. She did have abit of the volatile raver in her, and I could see how she might have attractedattention had we been in public.As darkness fell, the psychedelic effects deepened. We lit a lantern, and Bradand Kris invited me to come sit in their larger tent. They weren’t exactly intoan orgiastic scene, but we got into some touchy-feely stuff—Kris inviting me tofeel her up a little, the three of us snuggling, that kind of thing. The effectsof the mushroom were coming in waves, as they often do. Periods of relativelucidity alternated with long internal reveries; we would surface and exchange afew words, fumble a toke on the last of our joint and then submerge again in ourown personal hallucinatory ocean. Quite honestly, we were much too stoned toengage in any hanky-panky even if we’d wanted to. It was all we could do to hangon.As the evening progressed, the visions faded a bit; our eyes were more oftenopen, but we weren’t talking much. The faces of the odd couple looked grotesquein the yellow lantern light. I suddenly went cold with a sense of overwhelmingdread. There was something sinister about them. I revisited their story: happycasino dealers, off to Hawaii to spend some of their easily earned dough. Itdidn’t ring true.Suddenly, it hit me: They were serial murderers, sex killers, cannibals! I hadfallen into their trap. All traces of their grisly feast would be buried upthere in that empty place, and they’d be on a plane before the sun rose, leavingmy gnawed bones to molder in a shallow grave.My only hope, I decided, was not to fall asleep. I looked at them in thelamplight—nothing unusual, just a pair of young people like me. I wasn’t fooled.I muttered something about turning in and went back to my tent, where I grabbedmy flashlight and machete. Pulling my sleeping bag partly over me, I sat uprightin the darkness, ready to lash out if they made a move. The night was dark andmoonless; it would be a long wait until dawn. I was completely down by then. Noresidual effects of the mushrooms remained except the scenario I’d concocted,which still seemed totally plausible. I’m not sure how long I stayed awake, butI surely didn’t make it to the light of day.The next morning, everything was fine. We brewed up some coffee, packed up, andheaded down the dirt road. They asked for, and I gave them, my address. They’dbe passing through Honolulu in a few days and promised to look me up if they hadtime. They proved as good as their word. We spent a delightful evening togethereating Chinese food and getting loaded on my best Hawaiian bud.The incident says more about the ambivalent nature of the mushroom experiencethan it does about the Big Island odd couple. In deep mushroom states, one canbe seized by outlandish conceits that are very hard to shake. The mushrooms canbe tricksters at times, and they have a way of presenting delusions asself-evident truths. Many of the events and insights at La Chorrera are goodexamples. Like certain Irish bards I could mention, the mushrooms can, at times,be the best of bullshitters. They usually have an interesting story to tell, butit’s not necessarily the straight story. It’s important to keep one’s criticalfaculties tuned to the highest level of sensitivity in order to filter whatyou’ve learned, or think you’ve learned, from mushrooms.By the start of the new semester in the fall of 1977, I’d accepted an offer fromSiegel to move into a small apartment at his home in Manoa. This new livingsituation gave me a chance to befriend the two Siegel kids still living at home.His daughter, pale and soft-spoken, lived there with her boyfriend and theirbaby boy. The guy was a motorcyclist, a bit of a rebel, but an intelligentfellow, a physics, astronomy, and philosophy buff, and we hung out regularly andhad many good discussions. Siegel’s son was interesting and quite eccentric inhis own right. Enamored of all things British, he too was blonde and fair; buthe had his father’s barrel chest. He put it to good use by becoming anaccomplished bagpipe player, recognized all over Oahu for this talent. TheSiegels were anything but a typical American family, and it could not have beenotherwise, given such brilliant, driven parents and their inevitable influenceon their children. Though I lived among them, I never pried into the familydynamic. I didn’t want to know the details, really. Siegel was a mentor and arole model to me, and I preferred not to have any of my bubbles burst.Siegel’s grad students used to worry about his health. After all, we loved himas much as he loved us. He got no exercise and viewed his body as a vehicle tocarry around his amazing brain, which may have been his undoing. On any givenday, I’d arrive at the lab and ask Lani or Maggie or someone else, “Well, howbad is he today?” We all expected him to keel over at any moment. We judged thestate of his ill health by his pallor. Some days he looked pretty good; others,he was gray and was clearly having problems.Siegel eventually became the department chairman years after I’d left. Heperformed those duties well, but he really belonged in the lab, where hiscreativity could flower. In 1992, I was working as a research pharmacologist atShaman Pharmaceuticals in San Carlos, California, when I got the news that Sandyhad collapsed and died at his desk the day before. I think I cried more onhearing that than I did when my own father died. His death was a terrible loss,to science, and to those who loved him, and there were many. He was as fine ahuman being as I have ever met. After living at Siegel’s place for just under a year, I moved to anotherapartment. I was tired of the cramped quarters, and I wanted a place of my ownwhere I could bring someone after a date. The breakup with Deborah still hauntedme, but I was determined to move on.The next big phase in my life began unexpectedly at one of those beer-and-pizzagatherings that Siegel liked to throw for visiting colleagues. The guest ofhonor that night was Siegel’s friend Neil Towers, a professor of botany at theUniversity of British Columbia in Vancouver. In the course of a livelyconversation, Neil mentioned that he had a master’s student who was working oncharacterizing an enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway to psilocybin (which hepronounced “si-lo-cybeen”). His student, he said, had started the project butthen had dropped it to work on something else. Towers mused that he thought itwas an interesting problem; what a pity there was no one to pick it up whereshe’d left off.I practically fell off my chair! Trying not to spew my beer, I set it down andstammered something like, “Well, Dr. Towers, that’s very interesting. I’ve hadsome interest in these mushroom metabolites as well, for some time.” Trying notto betray my excitement, I added, “I don’t suppose you’d have a place for a newgraduate student to work on this problem?” In fact he did, as I quickly learned.We started corresponding, and he made sure my application to UBC was accepted,and with a four-year fellowship in the bargain. It was one of those shifts inthe time stream that sets you off in an entirely new direction and leaves youwondering who’s writing the script.A year after that pivotal event, I found myself in a taxi on a drive to theHonolulu airport. I’d finished my master’s in the spring of 1979 and was gettingready to start my doctoral work in Vancouver. I was leaving Hawaii behind,heading to a new country and a new phase of my life.Though I’ve returned many times to Hawaii and have maintained my connectionsthere, I’ve never again had the pleasure of calling it home. Most people arenever confronted with a choice to leave a paradise like Hawaii, and doing socarries with it the potential for major regret. I could have gotten my Ph.D.there. Siegel would have been happy to have me, there was stipend money, and Imight have ended up sticking around like those I knew who came to Hawaii tostudy and never left. Driven by ambition, the prospect of a career and newadventures, I gave up that bucolic life, which seemed the right thing to do atthe time. Now, I’m not so sure. I do know that once you leave Hawaii it’s hardto get back.Perhaps if current cosmological theories are true, we live in a world in whichall timelines exist, every possibility is actualized; somewhere on one of thosealternate tracks the doppelgänger of Dennis McKenna never left Hawaii. It’s funto speculate about such things, and useless, destined as I am to live out theconsequences of the decisions that have led me to this particular nexus of spaceand time.While I was busy pursuing my graduate studies in Hawaii, Terence and Kat weremaking their own choices as they built their life together. Shortly after theirmarriage in 1976, they moved from Kensington to a more rural setting not farfrom Santa Rosa. Within a year they’d bought their property on the Big Island;as shareholders in a “hui,” a collective land-ownership association, they’d tiedtheir futures to the paradise I’d later depart. Their first child, Finn, wasborn on April 7, 1978.By then, Terence’s career was beginning to take shape. Our first book, TheInvisible Landscape, hadn’t made the best-seller lists, but it got someattention in esoteric circles, and Terence had attracted notice as well. Shortlyafter his wedding, just before Christmas in 1976, I was listening to the radiowhen suddenly I heard my brother’s voice—unmistakable then, and now. He wasgoing on about extraterrestrial intelligence and how it would be hard torecognize even if we did encounter it; it might present itself in somesurprising form, he said, perhaps as a mushroom. It was a thirty-second snippeton an obscure station, but that was the first time I’d heard him air thosepeculiar notions to a wide audience. For me, that was the beginning of hispublic career. It was also the seed of a self-replicating meme that wouldpropagate like a virus through the cultural body for decades, and indeed isstill doing so.Terence had left the family and Colorado at sixteen while I stayed behind.Nevertheless, our lives remained entwined, linked not so much by physicalproximity as by our shared interests and obsessions. That bond culminated at LaChorrera, where events brought us about as close as two siblings could get.There at the peak of our folie à deux, the metamorphosis we attempted with lightand sound and mushrooms was an operation on a single entity, or so we imagined.That’s how we understood it then, and that’s actually how it was.Everything after that critical moment would be an expression of two livesdrifting apart. Like two boats formerly lashed together, we rode the samecurrent, at times closer and farther apart, but always within hailing distance.That ended twelve years ago, when Terence was swept into the vortex of his ownpersonal singularity, the same one we’ll all face someday. How long before myjourney ends, I cannot know. Whatever distant shore Terence has come to rest on,may it be a lovely tropical island and not a frozen reef. My feeble signals tohim vanish in the night like the wan glow of a semaphore in a howling gale; sofar there has not been, nor do I expect there will ever be, a responding light. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 40 - In the Trenches Before leaving Hawaii, I shipped my books and a few other things worth keepingto a friend in Seattle. Upon arriving there in the summer of 1979, I borrowedher car and drove to Vancouver, found a scuzzy apartment, unloaded my stuff, andheaded back to the States for a month with friends and family in Colorado. InPaonia, I paid $400 at a local garage for a 1973 Mercury Monterey, a huge thingthat had literally been driven to the post office and back by a little old lady.With the cruise control set and the AM/FM radio cranked up, I floated toVancouver in what turned out to be great wheels, a perfect road machine I’ddrive for the next five years.By late summer, I was eager to start the new semester and begin my research.Like most foreign graduate students at the University of British Columbia, I hada two-year fellowship that would be renewed for another two years if I kept upmy grades. I’d already completed a lot of my work in Hawaii—in plant physiology,biometrics, calculus, and plant biochemistry. My first two courses at UBC werein fungal genetics and advanced organic chemistry. Both were a challenge, and Iwas under a lot of pressure to excel. Among the many good incentives to keep myfellowship was that it relieved me of any teaching duties, giving me more timeto focus on my research.My research supervisor, Neil Towers, ran his lab as an incubator for asuccession of eccentric but brilliant students. For Neil, our work was as much asocial activity as a scientific one, but his standards were high. By then, wehad agreed that my project was to characterize the enzymes involved inpsilocybin and psilocin biosynthesis. For this, of course, I was well prepared.I knew all about growing mushrooms as a result of my extracurricular hobbies.Health Canada, the country’s public health department, had helpfully providedthe synthetic psilocybin and psilocin I needed for my analytical work. My firsttask was to develop methods for detecting and quantifying these two metabolitesin fungal cultures and fruiting bodies. I requisitioned a growth chamber in thebasement of the biology building, and for most of that fall and spring I had itstuffed with prolifically fruiting jars.My first-year goals were to devise techniques for extracting psilocybin andpsilocin from the mushrooms, and then develop ways of using “high-performanceliquid chromatography” and “thin-layer chromatography” to analyze and quantifythose extracts. Once these methods had been perfected, the reasoning went, we’dextract the biosynthetic enzymes from the fruiting bodies or the mycelium andincubate radioactively tagged precursors with them, and then quantify theresulting products: psilocybin, psilocin, and their intermediates. In a laterphase, we planned to look at the genetic regulation of biosynthesis in themushrooms. To do so, we’d first use mutagenic agents to make mutant strains,select these, and then examine the variations in the biosynthetic productsassociated with them. I never got to that point, as I’ll explain; but I didmanage to develop some reliable analytical methods.I didn’t know any of the other graduate students when I first arrived at UBC. Iwas an outsider, an American, and a loner, but as in Hawaii, I soon met otherkindred spirits. One was Terry, a “moss man” from Ontario working on bryophytesunder a prominent taxonomist in the field, the late Wilf Scofield. Terry wasnever into mushrooms or psychedelics, but he was peculiar enough in the best ofways without them. Another wonderfully odd new friend was Paul, who wasn’tactually a student, but a renowned amateur mycologist whose interest in the“neurotropic” species led him to discover and name several British ColumbianPsilocybe species over the years. When I started hanging out with these folks,we’d retire every Friday to the graduate student center on campus and drinkbeer—strong, Canadian beer—and I’d get smashed. It wasn’t really my thing, butthe camaraderie was a pleasure.During my first semester, in the fall of 1979, I had moved into another drearybasement suite in West Point Grey. I then bought a used bike so I could commuteto school along the bike trail that wound through the Endowment Lands, a kind ofgreen belt between my neighborhood and the campus. A construction crew had beenworking along a road that ran parallel to the trail. One day the constructioncrew dug a trench eight feet deep and twenty feet long right in the middle ofthe bike path, as I unluckily discovered that night. I left the lab late; it wasrainy, dark, and dreary, and I thought I was coming down with a cold. I climbedon the bike to start home, and my bike light was pathetically weak on the wetpavement. The crew had placed a small sawhorse mounted with a flashing light atthe lip of the trench—not six or eight feet in front of it, but right at theedge. By the time I got there, the warning light had either died or was barelyworking. In the darkness and the rain, I plowed through it and went head overheels into the trench with the bike landing on top of me.I briefly lost consciousness. When I came to, I assessed the situation. The topof the trench was a couple feet above my head, and I had broken something. Itwas very painful to stand; I couldn’t put all my weight on my left leg. Irealized I had pushed the only barrier to the trench out of the way, meaninganother cyclist was very likely to plunge in on top of me. I started to shout asloud as I could and shined my bike light out of the trench. In fact, what I hadfeared was narrowly averted; another botany graduate student was a few minutesbehind me on the trail. He heard my screams and helped me get out of the trench.Another rider soon headed off to call an ambulance.I had a hairline pelvic fracture, a concussion, and compressed vertebrae. Ispent the next two weeks Vancouver General Hospital, my first introduction tothe Canadian health care system. The final bill for the excellent treatment Igot there totaled $7.50. In today’s acrimonious political climate, Americanconservatives love to bash the Canadian health care system, but it has providedhigh-quality universal coverage for all Canadians (and American students) since1962. I find it sickening that our country has yet to enact something aseffective, and probably never will.My injuries called for bed rest followed by physical therapy. Seeing as how Iwas in the process of failing organic chemistry, my hospital stay provided agraceful exit from that dilemma. When I got out, I remained on crutches foreight weeks and had daily physical therapy. I also resumed practicing yoga, as Ihad been doing in Hawaii, and that may have accelerated my recovery. I was stillin a lot of pain, and couldn’t easily get around on my crutches, so I tended tohole up in my cold and damp apartment, covered in blankets. Occasionally, I’dget the energy to drive to campus and check my mail. I’m sure I cut a patheticfigure as I hobbled into the botany department mailroom. At least one personseemed to think so, a cute graduate student named Sheila with beautiful long redhair. I was struck by her and tried not to show it, but we exchanged friendlygreetings.As the winter and spring wore on, I gradually recovered. I continued to stayhome a lot studying for my comprehensive exams, which I passed without incidentin May. In July, the department hosted Botany 80, a large conference thatbrought in more than a thousand botanists from around the world, including someof my colleagues and friends from Hawaii. As students in the host department, wewere enlisted to help with logistics. My job was to greet arriving dignitariesat the Vancouver airport, and I was surprised and delighted to find that Sheilahad been assigned to the same group. Typically, I broke the ice by bumming acigarette. With little to do except hang at the airport waiting for variousflights to arrive, we had time to get to know each other. She was currently in amaster’s program studying algae under Dr. Bob DeWreede, who had studied underMaxwell Doty, a notoriously tyrannical phycologist at the University of Hawaii.At the same time that Botany 80 was in full swing, so was the Vancouver FolkFestival, one of the biggest such events in North America. On a slow night atthe conference I decided to check out the festival. I remembered Sheilamentioning she liked folk music, and I was hoping I might run into her there,though that seemed unlikely in a crowd of 10,000. As it happened, I’d only beenthere half an hour when I literally stumbled over her sitting on a blanket infront of the main stage. And she was alone. I knew she’d recently been going outwith a fellow botany student, but his tastes apparently ran more to classicalmusic rather than folk; so there she was, a lovely and unaccompanied redhead. Ipretended to be nonchalant about it, but my wish had come true.We soon moved to the edge of the crowd and fell into conversation, sharing ourlife stories. Sheila had grown up in the interior of British Columbia, thedaughter of a rancher outside of Kamloops. She had three siblings: a sisterabout fourteen years older, a brother about nine years older, and another sistertwo years younger. Many of her experiences growing up were not unlike mine inPaonia, although she’d lived on a ranch and I was what she called a “townie.”She was a bookworm like me and had a quick mind and strong opinions. She lovedto argue, I quickly learned, and was a good match in conversationalgive-and-take. We both were children of the sixties who had done our time inhippie houses and been influenced by the counterculture. We talked to the end ofthe concert and then reluctantly parted.It was clear there was a deep resonance between us. I at least was intrigued andwanted to see her again as soon as possible, all the more so when I learned thatshe and her boyfriend were breaking up. By mid-August I’d moved again, to adifferent part of Point Grey. I invited Sheila over to hang out, and she endedup spending the night. That was the start of something, but I wasn’t sure what.I had no idea she’d become my wife or that one day we’d be the proud parents ofa daughter. I only knew that she seemed to enjoy my company as much as I enjoyedhers.My work with the Psilocybes continued into the fall of 1980, but I was havingtrouble keeping my interest up. I had begun to doubt whether fulfillment lay inthe direction of fungal genetics and enzymology. One day in mid-October, Neilcalled me into his office. “I’ve got a little extra money in the grant thisyear,” he said, “would you be interested in going to Peru?”He handed me a flyer from an outfit called the Institute of Ecotechnics. Fromwhat I gathered, the institute owned a research vessel, the RV Heraclitus, andthey were soliciting scientists to join their Amazon expedition the followingspring. For a relatively modest cost, they would provide a berth on the boat,meals, and access to some of the remotest collection areas in the PeruvianAmazon. It sounded too good to be true, and as we found out later, it was.But with my supervisor waving dollars and the chance of an Amazonian adventurein front of me, how could I turn him down? For one thing, I immediatelyrecognized it as a chance to redeem myself: I wanted to prove that I couldreturn to the Amazon and do real science this time—and not go crazy. January1981 would be the tenth anniversary of my first and only trip to the Amazon, thejourney that took us to La Chorrera and beyond. This was an opportunity Icouldn’t pass up.So I dropped my psilocybin thesis project and rewrote my entire program. Insteadof working on the enzymes and genetics of Psilocybe, I would direct my effortstoward a comparative investigation of the botany, ethnobotany, chemistry, andpharmacology of two important Amazonian hallucinogens: ayahuasca, and oo-koo-hé,the orally active preparation made from Virola species that had first lured usto La Chorrera. It was an interesting project. Both substances were orallyactive hallucinogens with DMT as the apparent active compound. In the case ofayahuasca, the monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibiting beta-carboline alkaloids inthe stems and bark of a liana, Banisteriopsis caapi, apparently allowed the DMTin the leaves of the admixture plants to be orally activated. In theory, the MAOinhibitors in the brew blocked the gut enzymes that normally degraded DMT. As aresult, the DMT entered the circulation unchanged and from there readily crossedthe blood-brain barrier. The hypothesis seemed reasonable, but no one hadactually proven it. Oo-koo-hé was even more poorly understood. The substanceinvolved no admixture plants, or none that were known. The sap of various Virolaspecies that were high in DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, and related compounds was cooked downto a thick paste, mixed with ashes, and ingested in the form of little pastillesor pills.All this posed a fascinating riddle. Here were two Amazonian hallucinogensderived from entirely separate botanical sources, both ingested orally, bothhaving tryptamines—namely, DMT—as their active hallucinogenic components. In thecase of ayahuasca, the mechanism seemed to involve the blockade of MAO by thebeta-carbolines. But for oo-koo-hé, the mode of action was much less clear: theactive hallucinogens were tryptamines, but did the Virola sap also contain itsown MAO blockers? It seemed like a reasonable explanation—in fact, I knew thattryptamines and beta-carbolines were closely related compounds that occasionallywere found in the same plants. But no one had yet determined if Virola sapcontained beta-carbolines or not.The two hallucinogens occupied different ethnographic niches, as well. Ayahuascawas used in the Amazon by many indigenous groups, and had been adopted intomestizo folk medicine. Many admixture plants were associated with it, and therewere almost as many different blends as there were individual ayahuasqueros. Incontrast, oo-koo-hé had a highly restricted cultural distribution. It appearedto be used only among the Witoto and the closely related Bora and Muinanetribes. The alkaloid chemistry of some Virola species had been studied to acertain degree, but oo-koo-hé itself had not been. If the paste containedadmixture plants, they were unknown.It seemed like the ideal thesis project, just waiting for me to get my armsaround it. My first objective was to collect as many samples of each preparationas possible, along with specimens of their plant ingredients. From anethnomedical perspective, I wanted to document how the substances were preparedand applied. Back in the lab, I’d develop methods for determining if thoseconstituents contained tryptamines and beta-carbolines and, if so, how much.Finally, I’d devise assays to measure MAO inhibition and then evaluate sampleextracts for this activity.With my course now redirected, I pursued my work with renewed enthusiasm.Meanwhile, as winter neared, my relationship with Sheila deepened. We werespending a lot of time together, and I was definitely smitten. I discovered shewas an excellent cook with a special flair for Indonesian food and a gift foraccomplishing culinary marvels on a single hotplate. Even better! It’s sometimessaid that the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach, and in Sheila’s casethere was some truth to that. Without quite realizing it, I was falling in loveagain. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 41 - An Encounter with Ayahuasca [images/00009.jpg]> Don Fidel Mosombite, the ayahuasquero, and his family. I continue to be astonished by how readily the mind confabulates, creating itsown story to fill in the holes in memory, to the point where I can imaginelooking back at the end of life and wondering if any of it really happened. Thispoint was driven home recently when I ran across a daily journal I’d kept on myexpedition to Peru. My prolific notes now provide me with a record of manyevents I’d largely forgotten. This is a blessing, of course, but also a curse,in that it poses an obligation to reconcile what I remember with what I wrote atthe time.Among the recovered details are those that suggest my state of mind in late 1980as my departure neared. I had mixed feelings about leaving Vancouver for sixmonths, because, having just turned thirty, I realized I’d found in Sheila thelove I had been longing for. Even as I was admitting that to myself, I had astrong sense that a major epoch in my life had ended, and that a better chapterwas about to begin. That explained my reluctance to leave her for so long. Butonce again the siren call of the quest was strong. My destiny seemed to betaking me back to the Amazon.I’d be traveling to Peru with a fellow graduate student named Don, a soft-spokenguy from Victoria, British Columbia. Don intended to focus his collecting on theEuphorbiaceae family, which is notorious for its many toxic members. The plantsoften contain what are called “phorbol esters,” after the family name, a classof diterpenes that are known to affect cellular processes in many ways; some areconsidered carcinogens, co-carcinogens, and protein kinase inhibitors. Phorbolesters were important tools for investigating such processes, and newly foundones were always valued. While a few “euphorbs” were used in Amazonianethnomedicine, a far greater number were recognized as simply toxic. Don’sproject was to collect specimens of ethnomedical interest, characterize theirchemistry, and devise methods to investigate their activity and mechanisms ofaction.While Don and I had been getting ready to depart, Terence and Kat, then livingin northern California, had been awaiting the arrival of their second child,Klea, born in December 1980. I was pleasantly surprised when Terence told me hewas hoping to join us at some point during the six months we planned to be inPeru. I wasn’t sure how practical his decision was, but he was clearlydetermined to go.Don and I left Vancouver in mid-January and drove to California, where I left mycar with Terence and Kat. We then took a bus to the Los Angeles area, stayingbriefly with a professor friend of Neil’s. We were there just along enough towatch the televised spectacle of Ronald Reagan’s first inauguration and thesimultaneous release of the Iranian hostages after 15 months of captivity in theAmerican embassy in Tehran. The next day, January 21, we caught our flight toLima.The Amazon and Orinoco watersheds, with their teeming diversity of life, hadbeen drawing Western scientists for more than two centuries. Among the earliestwere Prussian naturalist Alexander von Humboldt and the French botanist AiméBonpland, who arrived around 1800. One could argue the modern era began in the1840s with the Amazon journeys of the British evolutionary theorist AlfredRussel Wallace and Richard Spruce, perhaps the greatest botanist of his day. Acentury later, a young Schultes modeled his career after Spruce’s and then wenton to inspire a new generation of plant hunters, to which I belonged.No sooner had I signed on for my voyage than I began encountering some of myillustrious contemporaries. The first was Timothy Plowman, Schultes’s protégé,who was working at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, home to animpressive collection of Peruvian plants. Our consultations with Plowman primedus on what to expect in Peru. Tim had spent a lot of time in South America andwas happy to share his experience with us. By then the world’s leading expert onthe coca plant, he was widely regarded as the heir apparent to Schultes. Manyethnobotanists, myself included, were saddened when Tim died of AIDS in 1989.The field had lost a talented scientist and a good man.In Lima, we visited the herbarium at the Museo de Historia Natural and thegovernment offices that issued collection permits (which were easy to get backthen). A few days later, we flew on to Pucallpa, a rough, tough, Amazonianfrontier town on the Río Ucayali. The place was a pit, literally. A mud-cakedbulldozer, half sunk into the mire of the unpaved main street, looked like ithad been there for months. We checked into a nearby flophouse. If it’s possibleto give a hotel a negative five star rating, this place qualified. Our room hadno air conditioning, no hot water, and a single fluorescent light in theceiling. There were two filthy mattresses without sheets, and it looked likesomeone had bled to death on one of them. From what we could see, the favoriteforms of recreation were drinking, fighting, and playing loud music until threea.m., all of which we could watch through a grimy window above the street.Breakfast in the dining room at another hotel on the corner consisted of an eggsandwich and Inka Kola, the fluorescent, greenish-yellow soft drink loved bymany, apparently, but which tasted to me as ghastly as it looked. As usual inPeru, coffee was a syrupy concentrate made from Nescafe that one diluted totaste with hot water. We’d encounter this preparation everywhere and grew toloathe it. While the country appeared slow to embrace the concept of freshlybrewed coffee, despite growing some of the best in the world, Pucallpa at leastwas ahead of its time when it came to the drive-thru window. Some of the localsenjoyed bursting through the swinging, saloon-style doors on their motorcyclesto order breakfast. It was all very entertaining and a bit shocking for twomild-mannered Canadian graduate students.Our first field trip took us out to Puerto Callao, a town on Lago Yarinacocha,an oxbow lake cut off from the Ucayali. There were a few indigenous communitiesnearby, including a Shipibo village called San Francisco, but we were bound foranother enclave, the Peruvian headquarters of a global operation known as theSummer Institute of Linguistics. Established in the 1930s, the SIL ostensiblysought to promote literacy among indigenous peoples and to translate the Bibleinto indigenous languages. By then, the SIL had established a far-flung networkof outposts as well as ties to many top linguists and anthropologists. Now knownas SIL International, the nonprofit organization drew support from evangelicchurches, which helped to pay for the planes and boats that gave them access toremote cultures. Though the group denied being a missionary organization, rumorhad it otherwise. Later, the journalists Gerard Colby and Charlotte Dennettwould argue that the SIL had been entangled with American oil interests and eventhe CIA, with dire consequences for both the Amazon region’s native peoples andtheir land (Colby, 1995).We were somewhat aware and leery of the group’s reputation, but we had bumpedinto one of their linguists on the plane to Pucallpa, who told us we’d find acolleague of ours there known to us only by reputation: Nicole Maxwell. Giventhe name of another SIL linguist who could help us find her, we headed to thecompound to track her down.What we found at the SIL base was a surreal piece of small-town America liftedup from Iowa or Nebraska and plunked down in the Amazon, complete with modestbungalows, white picket fences, sidewalks, and neatly trimmed lawns—not tomention a white church with a steeple. It was like an evangelical theme parkdesigned to make its inhabitants feel at home, or at least feel anywhere butwhere they were. Even the residents seemed to be playing roles in one of thosetourist recreations of an authentic village, Valley Forge or Old Richmond, wherethe employees wear period dress and pretend to be blacksmiths or chandlers. Inthis case, the village was a recreation of a 1950s, Mayberry-style town. I gotthe feeling the people were politely “nice” to us in a way that let us know theyreally viewed us as degenerate hippie scum. Our inquiries eventually led us toNicole having Sunday dinner with one of the local families.Nicole, when she came to the door, was a refreshing dose of reality. Tall,rail-thin, and ancient, she was already a legend in the small world ofethnobotany, partly because of her book Witch Doctor’s Apprentice, firstpublished in 1961 (and reprinted in 1990 by Citadel Press with an introductionby Terence). The book is her account, most likely embellished, of her quest tofind medicinal plants in the Amazon, beginning in the late 1940s. Having grownup a wealthy San Francisco debutante, Nicole became a well-known, free-spiritedfigure in Paris during the twenties, occasionally dancing with the Paris Operaand modeling nude. After the end of her twelve-year marriage to an air-forceofficer, she moved to South America in 1945 and became a correspondent for theLima Times, according to her obituary in The New York Times. Her fascinationwith jungle medicine began on a trip into the rainforest. After she’d been badlycut by a machete, her Indian guide treated the gash with a folk remedy known asSangre de Grado, or “dragon’s blood,” derived from a reddish sap. We now knowthe source of this wound-closing sealant was the latex from Croton lechleri, a“euphorb” like those my colleague Don was studying. The gash quickly healedwithout becoming infected or leaving a scar. Thanks to that experience, Nicolediscovered the mission that was to define the rest of her life: ferreting outjungle remedies and trying to interest big drug companies in developing them.Like many other ethnobotanists, she didn’t have much success, but her story wascompellingly told, and by the time I met her she’d become a legend. We becamefast friends, and I remained in touch with her until she died, impoverished andlargely abandoned, in a Florida nursing home in 1998.When we first met on the porch of the bungalow, she still cut a dashing figureeven for a frail lady of seventy-five. The white-bread surroundings made herearthiness stand out all the more. Her profanity would have put a longshoremanto shame. She insisted she owed her long life and good health to smoking atleast a pack of unfiltered Peruvian cigarettes a day, washed down with a quartof aguardiente, a popular liquor distilled from sugarcane.We had a lively conversation when she dropped by our hotel the next afternoon.Nicole had a habit of jumping from topic to topic, rarely focusing on anythingfor more than a moment, but we did get her to pass on some contacts in theIquitos area that proved useful in our search for oo-koo-hé. We promptlyabandoned the muddy center of Pucallpa for a place called El Pescador, acheaper, quieter hotel in Puerto Callao, after Nicole said she’d find us a placeto store our supplies. In return, we helped her move out of an apartment inCallao and into a house on the SIL base. Over the next few days, we spent a lotof time with Nicole and her circle. Most of them were affiliated with the SILbut weren’t missionaries. Despite my earlier skepticism, they proved genuinelyfriendly and quite helpful.Our next task was to locate Don Fidel Mosombite, the ayahuasquero that Terenceand Kat had met in 1976 when they’d traveled to Peru in search of the brew. Wehad no address, only his name and vague assurances that a certain womanherbalist at the market could put us in touch. When we finally connected withher, she arranged for one of her sons to take us to see him.The man who opened the gate was a stocky, barrel-chested man who could have beenanywhere from forty-five to sixty. He lived with his young wife, the baby girlshe was nursing, and two boys who looked to be about five and six. Neither Donnor I spoke much Spanish, but I haltingly introduced myself and mentionedTerence and Kat. I said as best I could that we, too, wanted to learn aboutayahuasca, the plants it contained, and his methods of preparing it. Don Fidelprojected considerable gravitas; it was clear he was an intellectual, or rathera sage, a man who knew many things, though not a scholar as most would think ofit. Whether he was actually literate or not, he was a genuinely wise andgenerous man who was willing to share what he knew.In conversations we had over the following days, he conveyed some of hisknowledge about the plants and their properties, about his understanding ofcosmology and the way the sacred world was organized. The world is divided intothree realms, he said: the earthly realm, the upper realm of God, and the lowerof the devil and demons. When one takes ayahuasca, he said, one sees enchantedcities in the upper realm and lost cities in the diabolical realm. Everything heknew about the healing properties of plants and how to prepare such medicineshad been taught to him by ayahuasca in the trance. Surprisingly, he said that hesometimes used mushrooms, but he regarded ayahuasca as very different, and muchstronger. Except for his comment about mushroom use, the rest of his statementswere consistent with what other ethnographers had said about practitioners ofvegetalismo, which is the syncretic mestizo tradition in which Don Fidel wasfirmly embedded. After a few conversations, I realized Don Fidel, thenfifty-six, was a genuine shaman, a practitioner of long experience, and in everyrespect the real deal. He was as good as any ayahuasquero I’ve ever drunk with,and better than most.A few days later, I had my first real encounter with ayahuasca. While living inHawaii, I’d tried a sample that Terence had brought back, but I’d felt no effectother than the expected purging. Here was a chance to drink the real thing, in atraditional setting, freshly made and presumably strong. When we showed up at7:30 on a beautiful moonlit night, Don Fidel was already seated at a crude tableat one end of the one-room hut. He had a plastic bottle filled with anorangey-brown liquid and had removed the wooden cork and was softly whistlinginto it. He informed us the “la purga,” was “muy fuerte” and “bien bueno’” (verystrong and very good). Don and I sat for a while in the gathering dusk as othersdrifted in: three men, one of whom was apparently Don Fidel’s apprentice; twowomen, one of whom was pregnant; another woman with swollen legs whom Don Fidelhad been treating at the house that afternoon; and Don Fidel’s wife. [images/00036.jpg]> Dennis and helpers preparing voucher specimens, 1981. We all sat on narrow and uncomfortable wooden benches arrayed along the innerwalls of the hut. Another plant substance that figured in the setting wasmapacho, a South American tobacco variety known for its strength. We smoked andchatted quietly in the gathering gloom until Don Fidel brought down a small cupfashioned from a gourd. He uncapped the bottle, blew a little more mapacho smokeover it, whistled, and then filled the cup to the brim and handed to me. It wasbitter and acrid, but I was prepared for much worse. I tasted it and thenknocked it back in a single gulp. Those who are familiar with ayahuasca will saythat the first taste is always the best; it only gets worse after that. Havingtaken it now several hundred times over the last thirty years, I can attest tothe truth of this. And yet somehow I always get it down.I retired to my place on the bench while Don went forward to receive hisportion, and then sat back down beside me. One by one, all of the men receivedtheir allotment, taking less than we did; Don Fidel took about a cup and a half.The women did not drink. We settled in to wait. Conversation ceased; presentlythere was only the gentle creaking of Don Fidel’s wife rocking in the hammock,the ever-present trill of insects, and the distant barking of dogs. After alittle while Don Fidel reached up and extinguished the single candle on theshelf above my head, and then began to sing his beautiful icaros. Some of hissongs were in Spanish; others were in a language I didn’t recognize then but Inow know was Quechua. His apprentice, Don Miguel, softly joined in.After each song Don Fidel would invoke a brief benediction in Spanish thatalways ended with the same refrain: “In the name of the father, son, and holyspirit.” He then blew sharply on his pipe several times. We sat quietly in thedarkness and waited for something to happen. I could feel the ayahuasca in mygut but beyond that only the extreme discomfort in my posterior from sitting onthe hard bench. There were occasional hints of images when I closed my eyes, andthe glow from a lit cigarette left a persistent trail in the darkness.Otherwise, nothing.While I was waiting, hoping for an effect, others in the group were retchingloudly over the sideboard of the house. It would have been unspeakably rudeunder any other circumstances, but here it was just part of the scene. Duringthe singing, I had fleeting suggestions of imagery in muted, earthy tones, butnothing as overt or clear-cut as I’d had on mushrooms. Most of the effect wassomatic. I felt paralyzed and dissociated from my body, but I think this wasmore from the discomfort of prolonged sitting than the ayahuasca. It was clearthat I had taken a sub-threshold dose; next time, I thought, I’d need a bitmore. After a while Don Fidel asked me, in Spanish, if I was feeling borracho(drunk), and I replied “Un poco,” a little. He offered me more, but I declined,saying this was fine for the first time, then complimented him on the beauty ofhis icaros.A curing session followed. One by one, the men approached the table and sat on astool while Don Fidel blew mapacho smoke into their eyes, ears, noses, and facesin short, staccato breaths. Each then returned to his spot as another stood up.The pregnant woman and the woman with leg trouble did not approach the table,but got their treatment lying down. Don Miguel, the apprentice, was loudlysucking on their affected areas making a smacking, popping sound while Don Fidelsang. I knew this process was supposed to remove the virotes, or magical darts,that were believed to be cause of many illnesses. These darts, projected througha curse, were the work of unscrupulous shamans or brujos who were willing to usetheir powers to harm a victim, often for pay. In the darkness, the suckingnoises were startling and unsettling.Another young man came forward, someone who had apparently entered the hut atsome point without me realizing it. His treatment involved smoking a pipe ofmapacho. He took several huge inhalations and coughed and retched violently butdid not purge.After the last treatment, Don Fidel lit a candle, and we sat around talking foranother half-hour before people started shuffling out into the night. I askedDon Fidel if I could take a small sample of la purga, and he obliged, filling asmall plastic bottle I’d brought. I gave him a 1000 soles note, worth about adollar at the time, and we departed. It felt so good to stand up! The moon hadset by then, and the night sky was star-studded and crystal-clear. There was acool breeze, and the phrase “enchanted evening” popped into my head. That itwas. We reached our room at about three.In the next two or three sessions at Don Fidel’s, I experienced the samesub-threshold effects. It couldn’t have been poor-quality brew; others in thegroup, including Don, were clearly affected. It was something wrong with me. Forsome reason, I wasn’t “getting” it. Reflecting on those first experiences, Ithink that ayahuasca is in ways a learned experience. If you don’t know what toexpect, nothing may happen. Also, my uptight hyper-vigilance may have preventedme from relaxing enough to allow the experience to manifest. I was a stranger ina strange land; though there was nothing overtly threatening, and certainlynothing threatening about Don Fidel, I was too invested in maintaining controlto let it flow. This may have been partly due to the fact that this was thefirst time I was back in South America and taking a psychedelic since mymisadventures in Colombia ten years earlier. I was highly invested in makingsure that that didn’t happen again—I didn’t want to trigger any kind ofpsychotic break. I had taken psychedelics quite a few times over the previousten years, but not in South America. I was keeping myself on a tight leash.During our stay in Pucallpa, Don Fidel and his uncle, Don José, were very kind.They understood the science of what we were there for. They obligingly preparedseveral batches of ayahuasca, pointing out the differences between the varietiesthey knew, offering me specimens of all the plants in each preparation andsamples of the final products. I carefully preserved them in small plasticbottles of methanol I’d brought with me for this purpose; later, thesecollections served as the basis for my lab work at the university. Over the nextfew months, I collected a number of additional samples from differentpractitioners in other parts of Peru, and eventually, back in Vancouver, Icompared their alkaloid profiles. Based on my analyses, the samples provided byDon Fidel and Don José were the gold standard, as strong or stronger than anyother samples I collected. This was further proof that my failure to respond wasnot due to deficiency in the brews. It was a deficiency in the apprentice. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 42 - The River of Poisons [images/00005.jpg]> Wade Davis and Dennis enroute to Pebas. March 1981. While we were visiting the realms of ayahuasca with Don Fidel, the variousplayers in our river trip were converging on Iquitos 500 kilometers to thenorth. The RV Heraclitus, on its Amazon cruise, was wending toward Iquitos, andwe planned to be on hand when the boat arrived. Terence was due there as well,having set aside a few weeks to spend with us. Don and I were still not sure ofthe details. We decided to split up. Don wanted to stay in Pucallpa and collectplants with the help of Don Fidel and a few others we’d met through Nicole.Meanwhile, I’d fly to Iquitos and get the lay of the land. Our plan was to meetup again in Pucallpa and then head off to greet our mystery ship together.I enjoyed being on my own in Iquitos, exploring the streets of a town I wasdestined to visit many times. I was keenly aware of its importance among modernbotanists as a gateway to the upper Amazon. My first chore in Iquitos was tofigure out when our foray would begin. Unknown to Don, I’d also be looking intothe feasibility of returning to La Chorrera. According to our plan, our searchfor oo-koo-hé would lead us to Brillo Nuevo, a village on the Río Yaguasyacu.Rumor had it that trails led north from there to the town of Arica on the RíoPutumayo. A modest boat ride upriver from Arica would take us to El Encanto, thestarting point for the four-day hike to La Chorrera. I had serious doubts aboutthis scenario. For one thing, there wasn’t enough time; for another, the areawe’d have to traverse was now beset by drug traffickers and best avoided. Or soI learned. The idea had been Terence’s, not mine. He wanted me to investigatewhether such a side trip might be possible—which I did, and it was not.I had thought I’d spend three days in Iquitos. The usual travel delays extendedthat to a week, but my stay was productive. Both Tim Plowman and Nicole hadsuggested I look up a woman named Adriana who had worked for years in the localbotanical trade. Her assistance proved crucial. Adriana was part Witoto, and hergrandfather was the headman at Puco Urquillo, a Witoto village on the Yaguasyacujust downstream from Brillo Nuevo. That would be our first stop in our quest foroo-koo-hé. The Witotos were relative newcomers to that area. The rubber boom andits depredations in the early 1900s had left the Witoto, Bora, and Muinanepeoples decimated by slavery and disease. Most of the survivors were forced fromtheir ancestral home near La Chorrera to lands south of the Putumayo, along theYaguasyacu near its confluence with the Río Ampiyacu. Our hope was that theWitotos there had not lost their ancestral knowledge of the fabled hallucinogenand how to prepare it. If anyone could help us find out, it would be Adriana’sgrandfather, Don Alfredo.As for the whereabouts of the RV Heraclitus, the news was good, or so it seemed.The boat had left Leticia and was due to dock in Iquitos any day. I got thereport from Franklin Ayala Flores, the director of the Herbarium Amazonense atthe Universidad Nacional de la Amazonía Peruana, or UNAP. We’d been in touchwith Dr. Ayala, as I called him, before leaving Canada, so he was expecting us.I found him in his office at the herbarium, which back then was housed in aramshackle wooden building, a firetrap, not to mention a habitat for the myriadinsects that were slowly munching the collections into pulp. There was a room inthe back with some gas-fired driers where the pressed specimens were dried priorto mounting; the place looked like it could go up in flames at any time. Ayalagreeted me warmly. He had met my supervisor, Neil Towers, in 1977 when both wereonboard the RV Alpha Helix, the well-appointed research vessel operated at thetime by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and funded by the NationalScience Foundation. Schultes had been part of that cruise as well. Neil’spresence on that expedition had helped me in Iquitos and would do so again laterin my career.Ayala introduced me to his assistant, Juan Ruiz, who was then studying forestryat UNAP. Ayala appointed Juan to act as our field assistant, which in realitymeant he’d be the field leader. His job was to accompany us on local collectingforays and, once the Heraclitus arrived, travel with us down the Amazon to Pebasand then up the Ampiyacu. I can imagine Ayala privately telling Juan to makesure the foolish gringos didn’t get themselves killed.Juan didn’t warm to us immediately, and our lack of Spanish didn’t help.Nonetheless, our meeting that day was the start of what has been a thirty-yearfriendship and scientific collaboration. Juan is an amazing botanist andethnobotanist. He is extremely knowledgeable about the plants of the PeruvianAmazon, most of which he can recognize and name on sight. I owe him greatly forall his help; I would not have had my career without him. Dr. Ayala, his mentor,has retired but still lives in Iquitos and continues to work on his massivecatalogue of the region’s flora. Juan is now the curator of the herbarium, whichhas moved to a three-story concrete building built largely with funds from theMissouri Botanical Garden. It is a real herbarium with about 100,000 specimens,many of them only known to science from its collections, an important resourcefor researchers around the world. Dozens of research groups have passed throughover the years, each required to deposit duplicates of their collections.Needless to say, this has created a backlog of unmounted, uncataloguedspecimens. Kat and I collaborated in launching an effort to scan and digitizethe specimens, the first step toward creating a digital herbarium thatresearchers could access over the Web. Juan, Kat, and others are carrying on thework as a project of Kat’s nonprofit, Botanical Dimensions, whose origins Idiscuss in a later chapter.The day after meeting Juan, I returned to the herbarium and examined a fewMyristicaceae specimens from the Puco Uquillo area, prepping for our visit. Thatfamily includes the Virola species used for oo-koo-hé, but a better-known memberis nutmeg. While at the herbarium, I ran into Al Gentry, a legendary botanistthen working in the field for the Missouri Botanical Garden. Gentry frequentlycollected out of Iquitos. Following his death at age forty-eight in a planecrash near Guayaquil, Ecuador, in 1993, the salon of the herbarium was named inhis honor. The crash, during a “treetop survey” near the coast, killed five,including two other scientists, American ornithologist Theodore Parker, andEcuadorian ecologist Eduardo Aspiazu. All were key figures in neotropicalconservation biology. Like Juan, Gentry was a plant fanatic who could identifyspecimens by genus if not by species on sight. Fully half of all the collectionsat the UNAP herbarium are Gentry’s, and a greater number are catalogued at theMissouri Botanical Garden and available through its massive database, Tropicos(www.tropicos.org [http://www.tropicos.org/]).The next day, I accompanied Gentry and a couple of grad students on a shortouting near Iquitos. For him, it was hardly more than an afternoon stroll, but Ilearned a lot—about both Gentry’s field skills and the incredible biodiversityof the Amazonian ecosystem. Even on that brief trip, he collected severalspecimens that were unknown to science at the time. I got a crash course infield collecting, Gentry-style. He went at it like a crazy man, grabbingspecimens and stuffing them into large plastic bags. Occasionally his team woulddeploy a set of extendable clippers on a long pole to reach flowering branchesor epiphytes growing in the tree crotches. He made no effort to separate thespecimens or even to treat them carefully. He just stuffed everything into a bagas fast as he could, as if it were a race. He told me the specimens would besorted out later at the herbarium, which was near enough to eliminate the needto preserve the specimens more carefully. It’s no wonder he collected nearly amillion specimens over his tragically shortened career.Back at the herbarium, Ayala informed us that the Heraclitus had arrived theprevious night. We all piled into the street and went down to the dock to seeit. The boat wasn’t the gleaming white, graceful craft I had envisioned, but ablack vessel with a ferro-cement hull and the silhouette of a Chinese junk. Itwas also a lot smaller than I had imagined. It was definitely not the RV AlphaHelix with its white-coated waiters, crystal champagne glasses, multiple labs,and luxury berths. Still, if our party could fit onboard (and that lookeddoubtful) we’d make it work.I met Robert Hahn, the director of the expedition, and some of the crew, whopreferred to be addressed by nicknames, among them Moving, Moondance, Nada, andBamboo. This was the first of many peculiarities that would surface about thisgroup over the next few days. What I learned from Robert was disappointing. Hedidn’t see his vessel going anywhere before April 1, then six weeks away. Thatwasn’t going to work for us. Terence was due to arrive in two weeks, at the endof February. We had to find a way to get out of Iquitos and reach the collectionareas or all our efforts would have been fruitless. Robert suggested that wemight be able to take one of his small speedboats and go on ahead with twocrewmembers. The Heraclitus would meet us later at Pebas. This wasn’t what we’dbeen promised, but I thought it might work. I returned to Pucallpa with my report on February 17. Robert had heard thatNicole was in Pucallpa and invited her to visit the boat and possibly join theexpedition. Don and I were delighted when she agreed to fly back with us. Wewere a frazzled trio by the time we arrived and found modest lodgings just offthe Prospero, the bustling main street of Iquitos’s commercial sector.The next few days were filled with logistical preparations for our tripdownriver. Terence’s scheduled arrival was on February 28, which seemed to poseanother delay, but that turned out to be the least of our problems. I soon sawfirsthand why successful military campaigns require a commander at the topfunctioning as a dictator. Our plan of heading downriver to Pebas and then northfrom there, up a network of Amazonian tributaries, required a simplecoordination of machines, supplies, resources, and personnel. But what shouldhave been relatively easy became almost impossible given the consensual style ofdecision-making insisted on by our new shipmates. Despite their hype andbravado, the Heraclitistas, as we dubbed them, appeared to be, if anything, evenmore clueless than we were about how to stage this event.Meanwhile, in my absence, the Heraclitus had come out the loser in a tangle witha barge while tied up at the port and now had a fifteen-inch hole in its cementhull. The vessel wasn’t going anywhere for the foreseeable future except drydock; the materials for repair had to be shipped in from Lima. Even the absurddeparture date of April 1 now seemed like an optimistic fantasy. We had nochoice but to go with Robert’s speedboat plan. The welcome news that Nada andMoondancer would be joining us was tempered by the realization that there wasn’troom for everyone on the boat, let alone our gear and supplies.A rumor had surfaced that Wade Davis, then a student of Schultes, was on his wayto Iquitos from Ecuador and might join the expedition. Luckily, this proved tobe true. He had been asked—and had tentatively accepted—to be the voyage’s chiefscience officer and soon arrived to check things out. None of us knew Wade wellat the time. A native of British Columbia, he’d briefly been a forestry studentat UBC and had taken some courses under Neil Towers before I joined the program.He’d left for Harvard when the chance arose to work with Schultes. A skilledoutdoorsman, he already knew his way around South America, and I welcomed hisarrival. With our inexperienced crew, we needed somebody with a strongpersonality to come in and take charge.Meanwhile, it had become quite clear that the Heraclitistas were not onlydisorganized and dysfunctional but rather weird. They had a humorlessness aboutthem that seemed out of place in easygoing Peru. There were intimations of ahidden agenda, or at least things about themselves they hadn’t fully explained.We knew that the Institute of Ecotechnics, which owned and operated theHeraclitus, was loosely affiliated with a theater troupe called the Theater ofAll Possibilities and several other peculiar enterprises. Only years after ourencounter with this odd group did we piece together the convoluted andfascinating details of their story.It turned out that the institute, the theater troupe, and even the Heraclitusitself could all be traced to a remarkable and enigmatic man named John P.Allen. A metallurgist turned Harvard MBA turned systems ecologist, Allen, now inhis eighties, may or may not have been a meglomaniac in his heyday, as hiscritics claimed, but he was certainly the producer, director, and star of hisown legend. In 1969, Allen and a few others had started an “ecovillage” in SantaFe, New Mexico, called Synergia Ranch. It was there that the Institute forEcotechnics and the theater troupe got their start. First envisioned by Allen asa vessel big enough for a crew of fourteen, with both a science lab and atheater, the RV Heraclitus was communally built in Oakland and launched in 1975.It has been plying the world’s waters ever since, often under sail, though thecraft was relying on its engine for its long trip up the Amazon. According tothe boat’s website, its Amazon cruise in 1980 had been inspired by Schultes, whospoke at a conference on jungles sponsored by the Institute for Ecotechnics inPenang, Malaysia, in 1979. On that occasion, Schultes challenged them to carryon the river mission he’d begun aboard the Alpha Helix. As to how that may haveinfluenced Wade’s decision to join us aboard the black junk, I do not know.In the mid-1980s, Allen and several colleagues founded Space BiospheresVentures, an organization that became known for founding, managing, andeventually mismanaging Biosphere 2, a three-acre ecological research facilityunder glass located in the Arizona desert in Oracle, near Tucson. The project’smajor financier was the billionaire Ed Bass, one of the well-known Bass Brothersfrom Fort Worth, whose family wealth was derived mainly from oil and gasrevenues. Of the four, Ed was considered the most offbeat. In the early 1970s,he spent time at the Synergia Ranch, where he met others who shared his dualinterests in drama and environmental causes.Biosphere 2 was originally conceived as a massive, closed-system laboratory(full of plants) that simulated, in miniature, the planetary biosphere—which thefounders called Biosphere 1. One goal was to study the human impact on naturalecosystems; another was to create a self-sustaining artificial ecosystem thatgenerated its own food and recycled all its waste. Some viewed it as a prototypefor an eventual colony on Mars, or even a kind of panic room after an ecologicaldisaster on earth. The Heraclitus apparently cost $90,000 to build; Biosphere 2cost $150 million, with millions more spent annually to maintain and operate it.As proof of concept, Biosphere 2 conducted two “closure” missions during which asmall group of “biospherians” hoped to remain sealed inside the enormous,greenhouse-like dome without any outside resources. All food was to be grown inthe dome, and ecological dynamics would be used to keep carbon dioxide levelslow and oxygen levels within acceptable limits. The first such mission, whichbegan in 1991, lasted two years; the second, in 1994, ended in acrimony aftersix months. By then the entire venture had foundered amid accusations ofscientific fraud and financial mismanagement. Though the project had manylaudable goals, the management team’s internal conflicts and lack of scientificexpertise, among other factors, eventually turned what could have been apioneering research project into a farce. The facility has passed through otherhands over the years and is now overseen by the University of Arizona. The storyof Biosphere 2 and the colorful personalities that originally built and operatedit is a lesson in the unanticipated outcomes born of the collision betweenscientific goals, human hubris, vast wads of cash, and competing personalagendas. Despite all the psychodrama, the project did produce some crediblescience, along with plenty of dubious science and scandalous gossip, a historyrecounted by Rebecca Reider in her excellent 2009 book Dreaming the Biosphere:The Theater of All Possibilities.All that lay in the future on March 1, 1981, when we found ourselves gathered onthe deck of the Heraclitus. Our departure was still a week away, but with allthe players by then in town, Robert had invited us to join the crew for dinnerand a group discussion of the ever-changing plans. Terence had shown up thenight before, and Wade and his girlfriend Etta had surfaced earlier in the day.Don was onboard, of course, along with Al Gentry, who we’d invited to join usfor the evening. Rounding out the guest list was Nicole, who was up for theparty but not the expedition, having stumbled on a bit of uneven pavement andskinned her knee. The scrape would be fine, thanks to Sangre de Grado, but she’dbeen unnerved enough to reconsider being trapped with our motley bunch up ajungle river. [images/00017.jpg]> Route Map to Pebas (Map by M. Odegard) The Heraclitistas included the captain and several others whose names I don’trecall. I do remember Terence describing one of them as looking like he’d beensleeping in an open grave. It all started out normally enough; we sat on thedeck conversing, smoking, and waiting for dinner, its delicious aroma waftingfrom the hold below. Then the Heraclitistas started howling, an ululatingkeening that went on for several minutes and then ceased as abruptly as it hadbegun. The rest of us looked at each other quizzically, expecting someexplanation, but none came. Conversation resumed as though nothing had happened.Then dinner was served, and we dug in. There was silence for a bit as we atehungrily, and then we started chatting and joking again, as one would normallydo over such a feast, until we realized we were the only ones talking. Ourchatter faded, and we finished eating as the crew maintained a stony silence.After dinner, we sat in a circle as they took turns delivering short monologues.I expected them to address the upcoming trip or its research objectives, butthey did not. Their comments were mostly unrelated to what we’d been discussing,and a few made no sense at all. The crewmembers seemed to be engaging in afree-association exercise during which everyone expressed whatever happened tobe on their minds. No one interrupted these monologues or ventured a response.That made for an uneasy and somewhat bizarre evening. Absent any explanation, wefelt a bit like ethnographers invited to participate in the customs of anunfamiliar tribe. We concluded their rituals stemmed from their theatricalroots. In other words, they behaved as they did, in part, because everything wasa performance for them. This explanation actually helped us to understand theireccentricities. Life on the RV Heraclitus was a work of performance art. Andmaybe the same could be said of the events that unfolded twenty years laterinside Biosphere 2. [images/00032.jpg]> Don Marcos preparing ku-ru-ku hallucinogenic paste in Puco Urquillo, 1981. Wednesday, March 4, marked the tenth anniversary of the Experiment at LaChorrera. It was not a good day for me. Since my departure from Vancouver inJanuary, my communications with Sheila had been sporadic, as often happened ontrips to remote locales in those pre-Internet days. I was pleased to find anaerogramme from her waiting for me when I showed up at the herbarium thatmorning. I wasn’t pleased by its contents, which amounted to a Dear John letter.She had grown lonely, she said, during the weeks of my absence and had starteddating another student in the department. One thing had led to another, and nowthey were getting seriously involved. She had written to let me know that ourrelationship, on which I had placed such hopes for the future, was over. I wasstunned and angry. I couldn’t believe that her feelings for me had turned out tobe so short-lived. Just weeks before I’d left, I had come to believe, or had letmyself believe, that Sheila was “the one” and that our destinies wereintertwined. I’d now discovered otherwise, just as I was heading into the junglefor what we guessed would be seven weeks. This news plunged me into a depressionthat hung over me for the rest of my time in Peru.We spent the next few days in a frenzy of preparations, getting our gear packedand organized for the trip. I was swept with doubts about the wisdom of strikingoff into the jungle, all tied somehow to thoughts of Sheila and the temporalechoes of La Chorrera. On the rainy eve of our departure, I slipped on the slickstairs as I headed below decks and landed hard but on my feet, badly shaken butunhurt. In my journal entry that night, I wondered if I was being softened upfor later as one by one the stops that kept me oriented in reality were kickedaway. Was I about to plunge again into a madness from which this time I wouldn’treturn? No. I resolved that wasn’t going to happen.Finally, on March 7, we managed to disengage from the increasingly tense scenein Iquitos and departed downriver for Pebas. The Heraclitus stayed behind. We’dcover the first leg by river launch and then proceed from there in stages, byspeedboat. As Iquitos disappeared from view, I was brooding. In my darkenedmood, I had begun to wonder why Terence had even come to Iquitos. I was there toconduct ethnobotanical fieldwork, to collect the specimens I needed to completemy investigations back in the lab. I took my mission seriously. I had nointerest in returning to La Chorrera or repeating our “experiment” or anythingrelated to that craziness. Fortunately, as I’ve noted, we’d already determinedthat reaching the Putumayo from the south—the first step to La Chorrera—wasimpossible. Nevertheless, I felt Terence might have had something in mind otherthan mere botanizing. I knew he’d be looking for Virola and othertryptamine-containing plants: samples for analysis as well as living specimens.To that extent, we were on the same page. But in his egging-on way, he wanted topush the envelope. That didn’t mean he’d push his own envelope. He wantedsomebody else to plunge over the abyss while he watched—and, if necessary, gavea little push. I wasn’t buying it. I made it clear that I intended to carry outmy research and successfully conduct my fieldwork. I was not in Peru to takemushrooms. If we stumbled on mushrooms during our travels, fine, I’d considertaking them, but I was not interested in recreating what had happened at LaChorrera. The message must have gotten through to him, because he didn’t lean onme.Instead, he seemed to be trying to undermine the interpersonal dynamics of ourgroup, which were already shaky enough. First he cast aspersions on Don,suggesting to me that my traveling partner was in a state of advanced cultureshock and was ready at any moment to go off the deep end. Indeed, Don had grownmore quiet and withdrawn, but he was a quiet man to begin with. In view of allthe craziness—of being in Peru and hanging out with so many odd and complexpeople—I wasn’t surprised that he was keeping his own counsel. He not only hadto deal with the nutty Heraclitistas but with my nutty brother. Don must havewondered what he’d gotten himself into, but I had no doubts about his sanity.Terence then voiced doubts about Wade. It’s true that Wade and his girlfriendappeared to be having issues, but I saw this as a personal matter between themwith no bearing on his abilities as an explorer. Nevertheless, Terence seized onwhat he saw as Wade’s macho swagger. I for one was a bit in awe of Wade and wasglad he’d agreed to join our party. He had every reason to give it a pass, and Iviewed his acquiescence as an act of kindness. Here was a guy who had crossedthe Darién Gap on foot. He was clearly among the most experienced member of ourragtag group, and he spoke perfect Spanish. But Terence, in his provocative way,loved to stir things up, if only with a few snarky asides. But what was hedoing? I didn’t know. Justified or not, my suspicions festered as we neared ourport.Pebas sits at the confluence of the Amazon and the Ampiyacu, which flows in fromthe north. Ampiyacu means “river of poisons,” after ampi, a virulent arrowpoison used by the Witoto. The area along the Ampiyacu and its tributary, theYaguasyacu, would be the site of our search for the orally active Virolapreparations.The Río Yaguasyacu, or “river of the Yaguas,” bears the name of the people whohave traditionally lived nearby. They now shared their ancestral home with theWitotos and the closely related Boras who, as noted earlier, had been drivenfrom their territory north of the Putumayo. The Witotos and Boras living in thePebas region were a culturally traumatized people whose plant knowledge hadlargely degenerated or been lost. Nevertheless, we still viewed them as our bestbet for obtaining samples of oo-koo-hé—or ku-ru-ku, as the Bora called it. Weintended to start collecting around Puco Urquillo a short distance up theAmpiyacu, then move to Brillo Nuevo, a more remote Witoto village on theYaguasyacu. [images/00007.jpg]> Don Alfredo and his first sample of oo-koo-hé. It took us a couple of runs to haul the entire party and our supplies upriver toPuco Urquillo. We arrived with a recorded message in Witoto for Don Alfredo,made by his granddaughter, Adriana, back in Iquitos. The impressive introductionworked. After hearing the tape, he invited us to string our hammocks in the mainmaloca, the large, oval-shaped, thatched structure that served as the village’scommunity center. We were in! Beyond the maloca, the village men apparently hadtheir own place where they gathered after dark to chew coca, tell stories, andsing. On our first night, we heard their mournful voices wafting across theclearing. The words were in Witoto, but the melody was eerily familiar. Then ithit us: the tune was “The House of the Rising Sun,” adapted to their eveningchant. The effect was incongruous and strange.Our collecting efforts around the village were incredibly productive. DonAlfredo and his son, Vicente, took us out to collect cumalas—a generic name forvarious Virola species—and we found about a dozen types. They promised toprovide us with oo-koo-hé in a day or so. The next day we repeated the exercisewith a Bora man, Don Marcos, who likewise showed us a number of cumalas andnoted those he viewed as fuerte—that is, suitable for making the ku-ru-ku.Finally, we found a medium-sized tree he said would do, chopped it down,stripped off about sixty kilograms of bark, and hauled the material back to hishut. This took about five hours.Don Marcos separated the inner cambial layers from the outer bark, tearing theminto long strips that he placed in a metal pot with a few liters of water; thiswas allowed to simmer over a low fire for about three hours. The inner bark wasblood red and had a strong, spicy aroma. Finally, he removed the bark stripsfrom the pot and cooked down the resulting decoction until the result lookedlike reddish-brown chocolate sauce. This he mixed with some powdered ashes madefrom the rind of an unknown fruit and macerated the whole mess together. It hada doughy consistency and looked basically like excrement. It looked even morelike that when he finally scraped it from the pot and deposited it on a bananaleaf and kneaded into a turd-like shape. This was the finished product. When Iasked him how much to take, he showed me the tip of his thumb.A day or so later, Don Alfredo showed up with his first sample, which lookedsimilar: a reddish-brown, turd-shaped object wrapped in a banana leaf.Altogether we ended up with seven samples: four from Don Alfredo, one from DonMarcos, one from another Bora, Don Jorge, and, back in the lab in Vancouver, asample of oo-koo-hé that Terence had collected at La Chorrera on his secondtrip. When I finally ran the analyses back in Vancouver, our informants provedas good as their word, with one exception. All of Don Alfredo’s samplescontained high levels of tryptamines, including DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, and relatedcompounds. Don Marcos’s samples were high in 5-MeO-DMT with smaller amounts of5-MeO-N-methyltryptamine. Don Jorge’s samples had no alkaloids, and the voucherspecimen revealed it was made from Virola pavonis, a species known to lackalkaloids.Our “large animal biosassays” yielded definite but not spectacular effects.Terence tried the first of Don Alfredo’s preparations and said it was definitelyactive. I tried Don Marcos’s sample shortly after we had moved upriver to thevillage of Brillo Nuevo. Here’s what I wrote in my notes the next day: > 16 March> I took the ku-ru-ku prepared by Don Marcos last night; about a gram to a gram> and a half. Within 10 minutes, a strong effect was apparent. This first> appeared as a strong burning sensation in my mouth, lips, and tongue, quickly> developing into a general numbness of mouth parts, extending into the throat> and causing a tightening of the throat, as though it was sore. It was> difficult to swallow…my breath was labored. The numbness that began in the> mouth gradually spread over the rest of my body and limbs…the extremities of> my limbs tingled. I was somewhat alarmed at the rapidity of onset, and found> myself reflecting on the use of Virola as an arrow poison—I can see how it> could be an effective one. If I had to do any physical exertion in this state,> I can imagine that it would have put my body under greater stress, possibly> even lethal. All I could do was lie in my hammock and concentrate on> continuing to breathe. My body felt very heavy, numb, and dissociated from my> mind. There were never any frank hallucinations—only brief flashes and the> feeling that they were almost ready to effluorish [sic] out. I was in this> semi-narcotized state for perhaps one half hour to 45 minutes. My body also> felt cold…a pronounced and abrupt lowering of body temperature that> accompanied the general slowing of autonomic functions. This effect persisted> the longest—in fact, I was chilly all night. After about 45 minutes…breathing> eased slightly, and I fell off into a drowsy reverie somewhere between> sleeping and waking…no visual hallucinations ever became the overwhelming> feature of the experience. Judging from the effects, I would say the 5-MeO-DMT> is the principle component of this resin. Most of the ‘pressor amine’> properties were present, but almost no ‘psychedelic’ feeling. It seems to be> more effective as a general anesthetic than as a hallucinogen. Thus Terence and I became the first non-indigenous people to bioassay thelegendary orally active Virola “narcotic” resin, or at least the first to reporton its effects. My speculation that it was mainly 5-MeO-DMT proved accurate;back in the lab, this sample analyzed out to contain a high level of 5-MeO-DMTand a small trace of 5-MeO-N-methyltryptamine. There was no DMT at all in thesample. It was interesting, but the heavy body load was a bit scary. I had noparticular desire to repeat it. Compared to mushrooms, as a psychedelic this wasnothing to write home about.I was totally stoked over the results of the last few days of collecting. Ourefforts had turned out to be everything I had hoped for. I managed to collect anextensive series of cumalas, complete with voucher specimens, pickled samples,and notes from our local informants. In addition, we had collected six freshsamples of the orally active pastes, and photographs of Don Marcos preparing oneof the batches. Our fieldwork was a total success and gave me plenty of materialto sort out later in the lab.Brillo Nuevo, on the Yaguasyacu, lived up to its name: New Shine. As we movedupriver, we found our new base to be more picturesque than Puco Urquillo. Wemoved into a nice guest-house by the river, which, compared to the communalmaloca, afforded us a modicum of privacy. A short stroll down a path through theforest took us to a lovely pasture where a number of zebu cattle grazedcontentedly—an ideal habitat for mushrooms. Here’s what I wrote in my notebookthat afternoon: > 19 March> We have broken through into some kind of paradisiacal place—Brillo Nuevo is> certainly paradisiacal compared to Puco Urquillo. Certainly a strange> experience to walk up to those pastures after settling in here yesterday> afternoon. A heavy feeling of déjà vu. After 10 years, we return to the same> place (essentially) but this time, we see it clearly and understand how much> we understand. But do we really know anything?> Gentle rains fell a couple of days after our arrival, assuring that mushroomswould magically manifest in the pasture within a day or two. We were notdisappointed; the morning of March 21 dawned sunny and warm, and the pasture,still steaming from the showers the night before, was dotted with big clustersof carpophores. We lost no time in collecting a healthy haul of the biggest andbest, and planned to take them together that very evening, or at least some ofus did. Terence and I had been busy trying our oo-koo-hé and ku-ru-ku samplesover the previous days, but we figured there had been sufficient time to clearthe residual tryptamines from our systems. [images/00019.jpg]> The village of Brillo Nuevo. That night Nada, Moondancer, Terence, and I all took mushrooms in our guesthouse. Wade, Etta, and Don took a pass, as did Juan, our faithful but taciturnand ever-enigmatic guide. It was a quiet but strong trip. The next day, Terence,feeling peaceful and renewed, pronounced it “the trip I came here to have.” Thisbugged me. I wasn’t so sure it was the trip I had come to have. It started outtypically enough with the usual efflorescence of hallucinations, but then I wasplunged into a dark and depressing place. I felt my many longstanding grudgesagainst Terence bubbling up, and was surprised by my anger and resentment. Theevents of the last weeks, the rejection letter from Sheila, the weirdinterpersonal dynamics of the Heraclitistas, Terence’s provocative behavior, myold childhood jealousies—all of this coagulated into a toxic knot of resentmentin my gut. It was not a pleasant experience or a particularly useful one.Days later, as we slowly made our way back upriver to Iquitos, I reflected onthis: > 23 March> My trip…became very introspective and depressing. I found myself wondering> what in God’s earth had motivated me to come here, why I had sacrificed the> woman I love to come to this hell hole in search of…what? I had the feeling> that the work I am trying to do…is of no possible significance to anyone, not> even myself. Particularly myself in view of what I have lost in order to do> this thing…. I found myself feeling great resentment toward Terry in this> regard…. He is already talking about my thesis and how great it is going to> be, as though he had written it. In his mind, he regards it as already done.> Easy for him—he is not looking at two to three more years of continued poverty> and loneliness in order to make it a reality—a reality from which he will> undoubtedly benefit as much or more than I. These feelings are not quite as> strong now, in the light of two days away from the trip that precipitated> them. Still, there is food for thought here and some points that would bear> discussion…perhaps if we get a chance to travel alone we can talk about them. If I was feeling conflicted, I was not alone. Since we’d achieved the goals ofour expedition ahead of time, thanks to our lucky break in collecting cumalaspecimens and the paste preparations, we decided to head back to Iquitos earlierthan planned. For most urbanized outsiders, being in the jungle for any lengthof time is uncomfortable, no matter how favorable the weather or thecircumstances, and the environment was beginning to take its toll on us. Terenceaptly observed that we were like infectious microbes injected into thecirculation. As soon as the barrier is breached the invader is attacked byswarms of macrophages that start to nibble away, slowly tearing it apart pieceby piece. And we’d only been in the field for a couple of weeks. Ours was anunlikely group to have been thrown together. Far more wearing than the physicaldiscomforts were the tensions that seemed to be infecting our little band. Thosewe’d brought with us; and in close quarters and under stress, they’d festered.Why is it usually the psychodynamics that tend to undermine these efforts andturn them into misadventures? Maybe that’s what the Heraclitistas and theBiospherians were really studying. In the end, human beings are ornery,recalcitrant, and screwed up; and whether or not one takes psychedelics haslittle influence on that.Writing in my notebook as we made our way back to Iquitos, I could feel thetensions of our strange interlude lifting somewhat. It was clear to me thatanother two or three weeks in that hostile environment would have broken us inhealth and spirit. Looking around, I could see I wasn’t the only one withprivate worries and pressures. Wade had been under stress, concerned about thecourse of his scientific career, the choices before him, dealing with hisgirlfriend. He’d certainly had enough of us. Nada and Moondancer were caught upin the peculiar life-structure of the community aboard the Heraclitus; they werewith our party but not of it. Terence, thorny as usual, always the trickster,had his own idiosyncratic understanding of what we’d accomplished. Don seemed inbetter spirits, and who could blame him? [images/00026.jpg]> Terence standing beside a cumala tree near Puco Urquillo. As I concluded in my journal entry that day, Iquitos and civilization wouldnever look so good as it would when we arrived there in the morning. Back in Iquitos, we spent the next few days recuperating, drying and processingspecimens, sorting out the voucher samples we’d give to various institutions. Ihad contracted a serious chigger infection at Brillo Nuevo, and my legs were amass of sores; I went on a regimen of tetracycline and hydrogen peroxide washesto control it. We had brought back fresh Virola seeds and live cuttings, andplanted them temporarily at Adriana’s place until they could be dug up andprepared for transport. We reconnected with Nicole and spent a few pleasantevenings with her at Don Giovanni’s Italian Restaurant (those who are familiarwith Iquitos today will know it as the site of the Yellow Rose of Texas, thecurrent gringo watering hole in town). Nada and Moondancer returned to theirberths and their shipmates on the Heraclitus; Wade was completely done, in everysense, with the Heraclitistas and with us, and he and Etta decided to move on toLima. Don had separated himself from our group, pleading a desire to move into acheaper hotel. It was as good an excuse as any.Terence and I still had one mission to accomplish before he departed forCalifornia. By this time, we’d collected many tryptamine-containing specimens,but one important plant had eluded us: chagropanga, also called oco-yagé, thejaguar yagé, or spotted yagé. In ayahuasca, this plant was sometimes used inlieu of the common DMT admixture, Psychotria viridis. In fact, oco-yagé was aliana in the same family as Banisteriopsis, the other key component in the brew,and at one time had been considered a Banisteriopsis species. Now properly knownas Diplopterys cabrerana, this vine differs from B. caapi in that it doesn’tcontain the MAO-inhibiting beta-carboline alkaloids that render DMT orallyactive. Rather, its leaves were apparently a source of DMT itself, and instaggering amounts—perhaps two or three times the levels found in Psychotria. InEcuador, and in Colombia north of the Putumayo, oco-yagé was the admixture ofchoice, but most practitioners around Iquitos shunned it. In 1976, when Terenceasked Don Fidel about this plant, he said he knew of it but dismissed it as “muybizarro.” Yes, very bizarre: in other words, just what we were looking for.Inquiries among our informants had come up dry. Terence and I wanted to get ourhands on it so he could take cuttings back. We had one lead left; Tim Plowmanhad collected it in Tarapoto in the mid-seventies. He had given us a collectionnumber and a specific location so we resolved to track it down.The morning of April 7 found us 450 kilometers south of Iquitos, having justlanded at the airport in Tarapoto. We checked into a hotel just off the Plaza deArmas, kicked back, smoked a little hash, and went off to explore the place.Tarapoto sat about 350 meters above sea level, and the higher altitude made itcooler than Iquitos. It seemed like a lovely little town, and I remarked in mynotebook how much it reminded me of Kauai. We went immediately to the site whereTim had collected his chagropanga sample, Plowman 6041, nearly a decadeearlier—a spot on the edge of town near the Río Shilcayo, a small stream runningthrough a shallow valley dotted here and there with modest houses and gardens.Unfortunately, the collection site had been bulldozed years before and was nowthe site of a fancy tourist hotel. [images/00004.jpg]> Terence packing seeds to take back to California, April 1981. What to do? In similar situations, we’d found that if we went to the market andtalked to the herb ladies, we’d quickly meet someone who knew about ayahuasca,or who knew someone else who knew. That’s how we’d met Don Fidel in Pucallpa. Sowe figured we’d give that a shot. The next morning we found every conceivablething for sale at the crowded market except herbs. There were no herb ladies orherb stalls to be seen. Someone suggested we look up the owner of a bar wherethe vegetalistas hung out sometimes, and off we went.Thus began a rambling search that lasted seven days. One inquiry led to another;every person sort of knew about what we wanted, but knew others who wouldcertainly know. Sometimes, valuable discoveries occur while you’re looking forsomething else. In this case, it was the acquaintance of one Francisco MontesShuña, the proprietor of a photo studio upstairs from a restaurant. A tall, thinman, Francisco was originally from Pucallpa; he said he knew Don Fidel. Hesuggested I look up his cousin when I returned to Pucallpa, a guy named PabloAmaringo Shuña, an English teacher, painter, and musician.Our eventual encounter with Pablo Amaringo would lead to a series of friendshipsand events that would play out over many years. Then unknown to the world, Pablowould later gain fame as a brilliant, self-taught painter of ayahuasca visions,thanks in part to my efforts and those of Luis Eduardo Luna. We “discovered” himand brought his work to the attention of a wider audience, a story I’ll save foranother chapter. Francisco, Pablo’s cousin, turned out to be an excellentethnobotanist and ayahuasquero, and I ended up working with him on my secondtrip to Peru in 1985. During the 1990s, Kat helped him establish anethnobotanical garden outside Iquitos called the Jardín Etnobotánico Sachamama.Back in Tarapoto in April 1981, however, we were focused on getting our hands onchagropanga. We learned it was known locally as “puca-huasca,” and not muchabout it beyond that. Though we never did find it, our quest brought us incontact with many interesting people, and a variety of plants and plantknowledge. We also got serious cases of dysentery after a grueling hike withsome local informants. For the next two days, we lay wracked with diarrhea andabdominal cramps in our hotel room. It was all we could do to crawl to thetoilet and back to the bed. We could barely muster up the energy to smoke hash,and that was all we wanted to do. Terence had thought to include a small bottleof laudanum (tincture of opium) in his medicine kit, so we alternated betweensmoking hashish and taking periodic droppers of opium. There is nothing betterthan opium for diarrhea, and I believe we would have been much worse off withoutit. The symptoms gradually faded, and we flew to Iquitos.By then, Terence’s return to California was quickly approaching. Our recentconfinement had only heightened the irritation I’d felt toward him since ourtime on the River of Poisons. Terence’s brusque way of dealing with the peoplewe met in our search had begun to disturb me. I rankled at what I perceived tobe his lack of respect as he seemed to verge on saying, “Just shut up and coughup the plant, already.” While I surely had some cause to be annoyed, I couldsense my reaction was overblown. Why couldn’t I just shrug it off? As I kneweven then, the psychological dynamics at play were far more interesting than mygripes. Once again, I turned to my notebook in an effort to make sense of thepeculiar virulence of my reactions.For both of us, the mushroom trip at Nuevo Brillo seemed to have awakened what Icalled “the ‘brother’ business” at La Chorrera. At issue was our conceit aboutbeing parts of a single mind. In a long passage, I found myself exploring thisidea, wondering if something in our ancestry or genetic makeup might haveaccounted for the close connection between us. That led me to wonder whateffects, if any, embryogenesis might leave on the mother, a biochemical imprintof some sort that might later influence the development of a subsequent child.My thoughts were mostly a form of escape or play—a chance to speculate about themysterious complexity of life. I sensed a glimmer of insight hidden in thosemusings, one that would never be articulated until Terence and I had “exploredthe potentially traumatic and hair-raising psychological back-alleys of what itmeans for us to be brothers.” A few words later, my thought broke off, never tobe resumed.Reading that passage thirty years later, I found it puzzling and yet somehowimportant. If nothing else, I could see that even ten years after La Chorrera Iwas still struggling to come to terms with what had happened there.Easter Sunday in Iquitos dawned wet and dreary. We spent it as we had the daysbefore, preparing for Terence’s departure, organizing our specimens, securingthe necessary permits to export live plants, and packing them for shipment. Thedrizzle continued the next morning as our taxi threaded its way through therain-slick streets of Iquitos to the airport.As I watched his plane disappear into the lowering overcast, I was overcome witha feeling of sadness and loss. I somehow knew we’d never again be in SouthAmerica together. I could sense that his departure marked the close of a chapterin our relationship, a chapter that had opened ten years previously, at anotherairport in another country, when my plane touched down in Bogotá prior to ourtrip to La Chorrera. That event was many twists back in the helical spiral thatbound our lives. I had no idea what the next turn of the spiral would bring. Theconfusion and conflict that I’d had felt toward my brother during our mostrecent adventure had brought little clarity or resolution. All I knew forcertain was that the currents of fate and destiny that had brought us togetherwere now, inevitably, causing us to drift apart. We were still in touch, but wewould never be as close as we had been during the decade just past. At least notuntil the end, an end that neither of us imagined or wanted, and one that wasstill nearly twenty years in the future. Don had already departed by the time we returned to Iquitos. He’d left a messagesaying that he was heading to the Sierra for more collecting and probably wouldnot meet me in Lima for the flight out in a week or so. This was probably thelast time he was going to be in Peru for a long time, his message said, maybeever. He wanted to stay a few weeks longer, and use the time to see what thehighlands had to offer. I’m sure part of his motivation was to escape us and ourpeculiar preoccupations.I was ready to leave. My funds were running low, and I felt that I hadaccomplished what I had come for. I missed North American food, and I wanted abit of old-fashioned, first-world comfort. First, however, I decided to stop inPucallpa. I wanted to see Don Fidel again and have another ceremony with him,and if possible collect some additional samples of ayahuasca and chacruna, thePsychotria admixture. I also wanted to track down samples of chicorro, apurportedly hallucinogenic sedge that was important in Shipibo medicine. I alsothought I might be able to secure a few more Psilocybe spore prints, to augmentthose I had collected at Brillo Nuevo. My journal entry for April 30 reflects myless than sanguine mood: > Another rainy day in Pucallpa. The place is beginning to pall on me, the> filth, the mud and squalor seem depressing and almost too much to tolerate. I> have had enough of Peru for a while, and find my thoughts increasingly turning> over the mechanics of how to engineer a satisfactory exit out of here.> [images/00003.jpg]> Pablo Amaringo (on guitar) and friends. It took me another four days to catch a flight out to Lima. Once again, thedelay proved fortunate. I decided to use the extra time to look for PabloAmaringo Shuña, the cousin of Francisco Montes, the man I’d met in Tarapoto. Theaddress Francisco gave me for Pablo led me to the same village where Don Fidellived. At Pablo’s house, an old woman said he was out but due back later. Idecided to stop in at a local cantina and return in an hour or so.I was nursing my second beer through a drowsy afternoon when a small,sharp-faced man approached me at the bar. Introducing himself in Spanish asPablo Amaringo, he said his mother had mentioned I’d been looking for him. Iexplained what I’d been doing in Peru and how that led me to meet his cousin. Wehad a nice conversation in Spanish and English over a couple of beers. It turnedout he taught English in the local high school, in addition to his amateur workas a painter and a musician. After we’d returned to his house, he introduced meto his mother, who turned out to be the woman I’d met earlier, and showed me hisbattered guitar.Opening a dresser in his bedroom, he pulled out a bunch of paintings on whatappeared to be fiberboard. They were representations of various junglescenes—pretty, I thought, but unremarkable. When I told him that I was due toleave Pucallpa for Lima the next evening, he insisted that I come back out tothe village the next afternoon so he and his friends could perform a concert forme. I was not particularly into it, but I wanted to be polite, and so Iaccepted, promising to bring some beer.When I got there the next day, he and three or four of his companions, eachplaying a different instrument, regaled me with a performance that was memorablemore for its exuberance than its polish. We had a wonderful time. I eventuallyleft in a taxi for the hotel and collected my luggage for the flight out laterthat evening. I departed Pucallpa with music still echoing in my memory,pleasantly buzzed, and suffused with the warm glow of new friendship. My gloomhad dissipated; it was the right way to leave Peru. Whatever its faults, thewarmth and kindness of its people more than make up for them. I still cherishmany of the friendships I made on that first trip, and many others I’ve madethere since then. Pablo would become one of my closest Peruvian friends, ourfates intertwined in ways we could not have imagined.Midnight on May 10 found me on a direct flight from Lima to Vancouver. As thejet taxied out before takeoff, my thoughts were heavy with reflection. I hadgotten a letter from Sheila a couple of days earlier, and it had stirred up muchof the confusion and resentment I’d been struggling to suppress. She’d broken upwith her new boyfriend, who was headed to Ontario to continue his studies. Hernote was not an apology or a plea to get back together; but it hinted, perhaps,at a modicum of regret that our relationship had ended as it had. Which onlymade me angry. For God’s sake, I thought, can’t these things ever just be over?Why did we have to stir all this up again, why drag it out? I’d done too much ofthat already in my life. It seemed just better to be done with it, to make aclean break. Here’s what I wrote: > 12:00 a.m. 10 May – aboard CP Air 423> Waiting aboard the 747 warming up to scream me out of here, I find much> opportunity for reflection on the trip and the return—what awaits me (or does> not await me) in North America.

At Canadian customs in the early morning light, I figured the one sleepy-eyedofficer would thoroughly inspect everything. I had a shitload of specimenbottles, pressed herbarium specimens, dried barks, baskets, woven chambira bags,Shipibo textiles, blowguns, bark paintings, and live plants—in short, all thethings one might accumulate over four months of collecting in the jungle. I alsohad my plant import permits and phytosanitary certificates at the ready, as wellas Neil Towers’s phone number in case things got sticky. I was prepared for ashakedown lasting two or three hours. The customs agent looked at me and then atmy stuff spread out on the table. Looking back at me with a shake of her head,she said, “You’re the person my supervisor warned me about. Get out of here.”And I did! I was home.Inspired by my good luck in the field, I lost no time in plunging back into mywork. I found another skanky basement apartment and settled in. I had plenty todo. I first saw Sheila a few weeks after returning. Our encounter wasn’t at allwhat I’d expected. These things never are. I was prepared to denounce her andmove on. Instead, we fell into each other’s arms. All the hurtful things I wasprepared to say, I could not say. All the bitterness and anger I had nursed formonths just melted away. She was sorry for what had happened. She wanted to bewith me again, and I wanted to be with her. What had happened in my absence wasforgiven and forgotten as a bad misunderstanding.Over that summer, we realized we were meant to be together. By the time the fallsemester started, we were sharing an apartment. My heart was full. I felt I’dfinally moved beyond emotional upheavals of my twenties. I had exciting workahead of me, and a good woman, a woman I loved, at my side. Life was good. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 43 - Adulthood and its Victims [images/00014.jpg]> Dennis working in the lab in Vancouver. The three years between my return from Peru and the completion of my graduatedegree in 1984 was a time of work and study. While I continued my labinvestigations, Sheila pursued a degree in nursing. Shortly before we’d moved intogether, she’d decided that estuarine seaweed ecology, the focus of hermaster’s project, was not really her passion. She was more interested in thehealth sciences, and nursing in particular. She had worked as a nurse’s aid inKelowna in previous summers, so she had some knowledge of what that lifeinvolved. Her decision was also a practical one. Nursing is a portableprofession that allows one to get a job almost anywhere, unlike algal ecology—orethnopharmacology, for that matter. Her employability would benefit both of usover my years ahead as an itinerant scientist.In 1981, we spent our first Christmas together in Kamloops with Sheila’s parentsand siblings. Though her family members were quite different from me—and fromSheila, really—they were kind and genuine people who accepted me, howeverstrange I must have seemed to them. I would have seemed even stranger, I’mafraid, had I really been myself. Sheila knew I was putting on a bit of an act,and she played along, though even she was perhaps not yet fully aware of mypeculiar interests—or at least that’s what I felt. For the time being, that Icould pretend to be normal would apparently be good enough.That December in Vancouver, I first met Luis Eduardo Luna, the Colombian scholarwhom Terence had befriended a decade earlier in Florencia, after his secondvisit to La Chorrera. Luis Eduardo struck me as extremely reticent and polite. Iknew who he was, of course, and the story of how his time with Terence and Ev in1971 had affected the course of his life. Their chance encounter was all themore unlikely in that Luis Eduardo was something of a stranger in his hometown,having been away for much of his youth. His early schooling had largely takenplace in Bogotá. At seventeen, he’d moved to Spain and begun his studies inMadrid. It was Terence who first told him about the use of yagé among the Amazontribes much closer to Florencia. Luis Eduardo’s father had known, however, andreminded him of an Ingano shaman named Apolinar Yacanamijoy who occasionallyvisited the town. In early 1972, Luis Eduardo tracked him down and asked him ifhe’d be willing to teach him about yagé. Don Apolinar told Eduardo he’d have tospend an extended time with him mastering the lore and following theapprentice’s special diet.Eduardo then returned to school in Europe. His immersion in shamanism would haveto wait. After finishing his studies in Madrid, he moved to Norway, where helectured about Spanish and Latin American literature at Oslo University whiletaking courses in the natural sciences and linguistics. In 1979, he got ateaching job at the Swedish School of Economics in Helsinki, which gave him thesecurity he needed to begin his ethnographic research on yagé in the company ofthe Ingano shaman he’d approached seven years earlier.On a visit with Don Apolinar in 1980, the old man agreed to work with LuisEduardo over the summer of 1981, if he lived that long, he said. In May 1981,shortly before Luis Eduardo’s scheduled return from Europe, word reached himthat Don Apolinar had died.Unsure of how to proceed with his research, he sought advice from Terence, whosuggested he redirect his efforts to the area around Iquitos. There, in 1981,Luis Eduardo met a number of old-school mestizo ayahuasqueros—there wasn’t yet anew school—including Don Emilio Andrade Gómez. Don Emilio became Luis Eduardo’sprimary mentor and informant for nearly twenty years, until his death in 1997.The use of yagé, or ayahuasca, among the region’s tribal peoples had alreadybeen documented by Western scholars; much less was known about its role amongmestizo practitioners. Luis Eduardo spent the next several years researchingthat question. His Ph.D. thesis, “Vegetalismo: Shamanism Among the MestizoPopulation of the Peruvian Amazon” (1986), became the definitive ethnographicwork in this field, and he gained a well-deserved reputation as the world’sauthority on vegetalismo. His 1982 documentary about Don Emilio entitled DonEmilio and His Little Doctors has since been recognized as a classic ofethnographic filmmaking.Sheila and I didn’t do much traveling over those years, tied down as we were byour studies. In the fall of 1981, we’d taken a vacation to Hawaii on some of thefunds from the settlement over my bike accident. A more memorable trip occurredtwo years later, when we drove to California for a brief stay with Terence andhis family. That was Sheila’s first chance to spend time with them—and to learnthe scope of the peculiar ideas my brother and I had entertained over the years.After a few days, Terence must have realized I hadn’t shared all of my checkeredpast with my new love. At one point, he turned to her and said, “He hasn’t toldyou yet, has he?”And in truth, I had not. I didn’t want to frighten her away. She knew I likedmushrooms and was a bit of a freak; she, too, had been immersed in thecounterculture so that didn’t alarm her. My fear was she had no idea how“counter” the counterculture could be. Terence handed her a copy of TheInvisible Landscape and told her she needed to read it, which she proceeded todo. When afterward she didn’t run away screaming, I took that as a very goodsign. By then, Terence had begun getting a lot of attention for his “rap,” as hecalled it. His personality and ideas began to attract a wider audience. He’dbeen doing some radio, notably Something’s Happening, the program created in1977 by Roy Tuckman, alias Roy of Hollywood, on the Los Angeles station KPFK. IfI recall, Terence had another work in progress at the time, an audiocassetteversion of True Hallucinations, released in 1984, almost a decade before thatstory appeared in book form. In May 1983, Terence had appeared at a landmarkconference on psychedelics at the University of California, Santa Barbara,alongside luminaries like Albert Hoffman, Sasha Shulgin, Andrew Weil, and RalphMetzner. His edgy talk was titled “Hallucinogens: Monkeys Discover Hyperspace,aka Return to the Logos.” It was quite unlike anything else presented there andmarked an important moment in the emergence of his public persona. People lovedhearing his wild ideas, and Terence’s mesmeric voice and articulate presentationmade him the perfect spokesman.In one sense, it might not have mattered what he said. His audiences tended tobe uncritical, or at least they seldom challenged him. People usually listenedin slack-jawed fascination. I used to kid Terence that he could stand up andread the phonebook and listeners would hang on every word, because it wasn’twhat he said, it was that he said it so darn well. His rap was not science, itwas not exactly philosophy either; it was poetry, and Terence was inventinghimself as the Irish bard of the psychedelic zeitgeist. The things he saidresonated with people. Terence became popular precisely because he could saywhat he said so much better than anyone else, but obviously many had been primedfor his message by their psychedelic experiences. His talks were works of art;they were beautiful, and people heard in that beauty a confirmation of their ownpsychedelically illuminated insights. Through him, many listeners learned totrust their intuitions rather than simply accepting the assumptions of scienceand secularism, dreary existentialism, and religion. Terence told stories thatpost-scientific rationalists could believe, and in doing so he re-infused theuniverse with magic and wonder. He became the wizard-shaman of a re-sacralizedcosmos scintillating with psychedelically charged portent and permeated withlife and intelligence and love. Having discovered the “machine elves” thatseemed to exist in the hyperspace of the tryptamine state, he became theirringmaster, jumping them through their hoops for an enthralled new generation ofpsychedelic acolytes.This was Terence’s strength and talent, and I give him his due for being able toarticulate that message to so many, and for so long. Indeed, his talks seem asfresh and stimulating today as they were back in the eighties and nineties.Twelve years after his death, they remain remarkably contemporary and timely. Hehas achieved a weird kind of immortality; he has become a kind of ghost,haunting the back roads of cyberspace, and the vast body of his talks and rapswill live forever on the Net. I think Terence would have appreciated that.I am contacted by many young people who were in diapers or not even born whenTerence was at the height of his career, who tell me they first started thinkingand wondering about the Big Questions, questions about the meaning of life forus as individuals and as a species, as a result of listening to Terence’sspeeches and raps. Many tell me that his work has brought hope and meaning,curiosity and wonder, into their lives. Some of them have become my students andfriends over the years, and I owe Terence for that. It’s really Terence theywant, not me. I’m much more down to earth, more scientifically oriented, andpeople appreciate that, too. But if it weren’t for Terence and his culturalimpact, no one would care very much about what I might think or have to say. Sofor that, and for giving me platforms like this book to tell my story and sharemy ideas, I’m grateful to him. While Terence had begun forging his public persona, I’d been in the lab inVancouver, slowly working toward my degree. When he wasn’t teaching in Finland,Luis Eduardo had been making his film and furthering his research with DonEmilio in Peru. Like many others who at some point had belonged to our circlegoing back to the Berkeley days, we’d more or less managed to integrate theheady ideals of earlier times into our adult lives.Not everyone had been so fortunate. My last encounter with John Parker occurredin 1983, on our way back to Vancouver after our visit with Terence and Kat.John, an important early mentor, had disappeared from my world; we hadn’t spokenfor years. In the interim, I’d heard he’d become increasingly dysfunctional.Erik and Lisa, Terence’s good friends, had by then moved to Ukiah, California,to join a Buddhist community known as the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas, foundedby Lisa’s longtime teacher, Hsuan Hua. (Lisa, my first real girlfriend, had beenfollowing her Buddhist practice since before the two of us were briefly togetherin 1969.) John, meanwhile, had moved to the nearby town of Willits. Eric andLisa weren’t in touch with him, but they knew the woman he was living with, apoet; through her they set up a time when Sheila and I could say hello to Johnat a local coffee shop when we passed through. He had no job; he lived off aCalifornia welfare program that gave aid to the totally disabled, which sadlyhe’d become. He could no more have supported himself with a job than the suncould rise in the West; it was not within the realm of possibility.The sight of him shocked me. As odd and eccentric as John had always been, hewas also brilliant, and I had learned much from him in those early days,especially during our hash-fueled, late-night conversations in Boulder. I hadloved him and looked up to him. The staring creature across the table from me inthe coffee house, shrunken into a shabby woolen coat, was a shadow of the friendI had known. He had lived a hard life, and it had taken its toll. Bouts ofhomelessness, serious abuse of alcohol and meth, all had left their mark. Hissallow skin was grizzled and pockmarked, his meth-rotten teeth stained withtobacco, his eyes rheumy; he was the very picture of a man caught in a longspiral toward dissolution and death.Our conversation was disjointed and rambling. His attention wandered, and he didnot seem able to follow the thread. Only once did he brighten momentarily, theold twinkle returning to his eyes when he described his encounter with a fairyback in the woods near where he was living in a kind of cave. His spirit andpassion had burned so brightly, his quick mind and amazing ideas, his kindnessand humor, his freely shared knowledge of the esoteric and arcane; all of it hadmeant so much to me as a curious young man with an affinity for the peculiar.Now all of that was gone. The wizard’s wand had lost its charge long ago. He wasnow a pathetic derelict, poisoned by drugs, tormented by delusions andhallucinations, his head filled with voices and visions of fairies. It made mewant to cry.It was the last time we spoke. He was Terence’s age at the time, aboutthirty-six, though he looked seventy. We fell out of touch again for decades,and I assumed he had died at some point. I was surprised when Erik contacted mein 2005 to say that John had shown up unexpectedly at the office where heworked, and that since then the two of them had occasionally gotten together forlunch. Erik, John’s only link to his former friends, gave me his P.O. boxnumber. Lisa had made it quite clear that she wanted no contact with him, and hehad honored her wish.I sent John a long letter in 2006, a rambling recap full of reminiscences, butwe never communicated after that. He died a few years later outside the rottingwelfare motel in Willits where he’d been living alone. Someone found him nakedin the motel parking lot, draped over the hood of a car. It may have been anoverdose, or poor John’s abused body may have just given up. There will never beanother John Parker. It was a dismal end for a singular soul. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 44 - The Plant Teachers: 1985 Despite all its literary associations, the year 1984 turned out to be nothinglike the dystopian future we might have feared, even if we were in the darkestdays of the Reagan administration. Compared to what we’ve witnessed since, thatwas an age of enlightenment and reason. In Canada, we were insulated to somedegree from the idiocies of American politics, but that was about to change aswe both reached the end of school. Sheila graduated with her nursing degree, andI managed to complete my Ph.D. Once I had completed my doctorate, the kindgovernment of Canada, which had supported and paid for my education, let me knowthat my student visa was about to expire, and that I needed to clear out orbecome an illegal immigrant. Their message, back then at least, was, “Now thatyou have your education, go home and help your Third-World country, the UnitedStates.”So I left for California in May that year to seek my fortune. I wanted to leaveBritish Columbia; I didn’t want to leave Sheila. She was open to the idea ofjoining me in the States, once I’d found a gig. I didn’t know whether I waslooking for a job or a postdoctoral fellowship. I was now an expert on thechemistry and pharmacology of two Amazonian hallucinogens, ayahuasca andoo-koo-hé. I had a newly minted thesis and several papers “submitted” to proveit. It wasn’t a lot to parlay into an entry-level position in the Silicon Valleybiotech industry.Then I heard about a possible semi-legitimate job as an MDMA chemist. At thetime, MDMA, or “ecstasy” among other names, was not yet scheduled as acontrolled substance—that is, it was still legal. When I arrived in California,Terence told me about a gentleman in Mendocino, an entrepreneur from Texas whowas planning to establish a large-scale MDMA production operation and needed achemist. I, with my newly minted Ph.D., was an ideal candidate, though I am notreally a chemist. This information came indirectly through another friend andmentor, Alexander (Sasha) Shulgin, who is renowned in the psychedelic world asthe brilliant inventor of numerous synthetic psychedelics. His importantcontributions to psychedelic pharmacology grew out of his chosen specialty:investigation of the structure/activity relationships of molecules related tomescaline. Over his career, he created and published on over 300 suchderivatives. Sasha had kindly agreed to act as the outside examiner on mythesis, so we were in frequent contact. Though Sasha did not invent MDMA, he hadlearned of it through his students. After synthesizing and testing it on himselfin 1976, he quickly recognized its potential therapeutic uses. By 1984, the drughad attracted the attention of underground therapists, who believed it could beused to facilitate psychotherapy. Though it was eventually scheduled, it is nowbeing evaluated in several clinical studies for the treatment of post-traumaticstress disorder, or PTSD.Terence and others encouraged me to pay this Texas fellow a visit, which I did.He was a smooth talker with big plans, but the cult-like atmosphere of theoperation put me off. It seemed to be a kind of commune where MDMA was consumedmore or less constantly. There was something a little strange about the wholething; and although MDMA was not yet scheduled there were already rumblings thatit soon would be. Outside a secret plan for world dominion, I wasn’t sure thatproducing several kilos of MDMA every week in semi-automated laboratories wassuch a good idea. For one thing, it was bound to attract the attention of theauthorities sooner or later, and I wanted to make my living legally. But afterenduring relative poverty for years, I was certainly tempted. About that time,in May 1984, I was invited to a conference on psychedelics at Esalen, on thetopic of “Technologies of the Sacred,” along with Terence, Sasha, Stan Grof, andother psychedelic celebrities. It was a marvelous, stimulating event. Havingjust completed my work on ayahuasca and oo-koo-hé, I had something to contributeto this community, but I wasn’t sure how to turn my knowledge into a legitimatecareer.The situation temporarily resolved itself when I got a call from Dr. CharlesThomas, director of Helicon, a small, private, nonprofit foundation in San Diegodedicated to investigating the relationship between nutrition and cancer.Somehow, Thomas had gotten one of the many resumes I’d mailed out before leavingCanada. He had funding for a project to investigate the relationship betweendietary selenium and cancer. There was epidemiological and demographic evidencethat a diet rich in selenium could prevent cancer, and he had a theory thatselenium prevented mutations. He was investigating this by using mutation-pronestrains of yeast, and needed a postdoc quickly, and invited me down for aninterview. My qualifications were nil, except that I knew sterile inoculationtechniques from all my previous work on mushrooms, so I figured I could do aswell with yeast. It was a gig, and a way to get back to the States, so Iaccepted his offer.I returned to Vancouver, packed up the Merc, and drove the battleship south forthe last time; I barely made it to San Diego and traded in the car as soon as Idid. I quickly found a small house fronting a back alley in a San Diegoneighborhood known as Normal Heights. (We used to joke: Is it a place, or astate of mind?) Sheila had stayed on in Vancouver to work over the summer andjoined me in the fall.I settled in at Helicon Foundation, which was located in a large warehouse in anindustrial district of San Diego. Thomas was an eminent Harvard-trainedmolecular biologist and virologist. His father had been chairman of the board atMonsanto, so he had some family wealth. Helicon was Charlie’s plaything. Hedidn’t need the money or any outside funding; the foundation was a platform forhim to conduct any research that caught his fancy. Some of the work was quitesolid, and some of it was less so. Thomas belonged to a small coterie ofscientists who believed that the virus known as HIV was not the cause of AIDS.In this, he’s had some pretty good company, including Berkeley cell biologistPeter Duesberg and Nobel Prize winner Kary Mullis, a key developer of thepolymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods that revolutionized molecular biology.I’m not qualified to say whether there is any validity to such ideas. Mostmainstream scientists consider AIDS “denialism” to be a crackpot conspiracytheory; then again, when it comes to questioning accepted dogma, mainstreamscience can be as hidebound and close-minded as the most fundamentalistreligion, as anyone who has worked in the field of psychedelics will know. Thefact that Charlie was among this group of heretics tells you a lot about theguy. He was a pain in the butt of orthodoxy. We liked each other on that basisalone. That may have surprised us both, considering how much he offended myliberal sensitivities, and how I surely must have rankled the conservative inhim. We maintained a productive, if edgy, relationship. He was not without asense of humor, and I think he was at least a competent scientist even if he didhave funny ideas about AIDS. [images/00027.jpg]> A proud father and his two sons on Dennis’s wedding day, 1984. Soon after, Sheila joined me in San Diego. The time had arrived for us toformalize our relationship and get married, in part so she could apply for agreen card and find a job. Both Sheila and I were recovering Catholics whowanted nothing to do with Roman Catholicism. Instead, we made plans to getmarried in a local Gnostic church with a laid-back, sandal-wearing pastor. Itwas a perfect fit for us. The Gnostic faith seemed more genuine and lessrevisionist to us than our childhood religion. The Gnostics, after all, were thereal deal, and perhaps even mushroom cultists in the distant past. This littlechurch specialized in weddings; that’s how they supported themselves. They’dperform the simple ceremony and sign the certificate, no muss, no fuss, and theywouldn’t be coming after us to attend services or otherwise take part in theircommunity.We had a very sweet, and very small, wedding in October. Dad and his wife Loiswere there, along with Terence, Kat, and their kids, our friends Mike and Ellenfrom our UBC graduate student days, and Iris Pugh, who together with her latehusband Truman had taken Terence in for his senior year in high school inLancaster. We had the reception in our backyard. We stayed overnight at a localbed and breakfast—our honeymoon—and the next day the entire family went to theSan Diego Zoo in Balboa Park. It was about as low-key (and cheap) a wedding asone could hope for.And with that our lives resumed. Sheila found a job in a long-term carefacility, which wasn’t the most desirable position, but there were no jobsavailable in acute-care hospitals. As for me, the Helicon gig was just that, agig. I had no particular interest in the work; I was an ethnobotanist, afterall, and saw my career path as lying more in that direction. I started plottingmy next move almost as soon as I got to San Diego.It was only after we had moved to San Diego that I started to benefit,indirectly, from Terence’s growing fame. When Roy Tuckman learned that I livedin San Diego, he invited me on Something’s Happening a couple of times, so thatafforded me my first modest entry into the public arena. Later, in 1986, withthe help of Terence and one of his Hollywood friends, we organized a conferencein Santa Monica called “Hallucinogens in Ethnomedicine.” Terence was a featuredguest, along with Luis Eduardo Luna and Douglas Sharon, the director of the SanDiego Museum of Man. Sharon had become a minor figure in the psychedelicpantheon thanks to his book, Wizard of the Four Winds: A Shaman’s Story,published 1978. That turned out be a nice little gathering, though far lessinfluential than the earlier Santa Barbara event. In 1985, Luis Eduardo Luna invited me to present a paper on my work on ayahuascaat the forty-fifth International Congress of the Americanists, to be held at theUniversity of the Andes in Bogotá, Colombia that July. He had organized asatellite symposium on ayahuasca and invited me, along with a number ofestablished anthropologists, including Michael Taussig from Columbia University.I was the only botanist or phytochemist to be invited. Luis Eduardo had beenconducting ethnographic fieldwork in Peru every summer with his mentor, DonEmilio, and teaching during the winters in Helsinki. Together we presented apaper combining the ethnographic data we’d collected, mainly from Don Emilio butalso from other informants, on the “plant teachers,” or plantas que enseñan,with the phytochemical and pharmacological data I had collected, mainly throughextensive literature reviews.In the vegetalismo tradition, ayahuasca is at the center of a vast pharmacopoeiaof medicinal plants that are used either as admixtures to the brew or bythemselves. Like ayahuasca and its most commonly used DMT-containing admixtures,all these plants are regarded as intelligent, and the apprentice shaman mustlearn their properties by keeping a strict diet and consuming the plants, eitheralone or as part of ayahuasca. In this way, the plants will “teach” theapprentice their properties and uses in curing. Some of the plants in thistraditional pharmacopoeia are among the most toxic and biologically activeplants known from the Amazon, so it is not surprising that they possess acomplex chemistry and pharmacology, even apart from their spiritual qualities.Eduardo and I had collaborated on this paper before I’d left UBC, and wepresented it at the conference. We submitted it for publication in the symposiumproceedings, and it was published in Spanish in the prestigious journal AmericaIndigena. Later, an English version was published in a book co-edited bySchultes entitled Ethnobotany: Evolution of a Discipline (1995).I also presented another paper on my chemical and pharmacological investigationsof ayahuasca and some of my work on oo-koo-hé. Both of my papers had beenrecently published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology, and I was quite proud ofthe recognition my work had gotten. My pride quickly withered, however, whenMichael Taussig launched into a thirty-minute polemic, in Spanish, that wasbasically a criticism of reductionist science and the absurdity of mypresumption that studying the chemistry or pharmacology of these plants couldever explain anything of significance about them or their true role inethnomedicine, that all this work was bullshit and I was a fool and charlatan(not to mention a pawn of the pharmaceutical industry) for having the temerityeven to show up at this symposium, and that I should be publicly flogged, if notexecuted, on the spot for being the contemptible piece of shit that I was. Orsomething like that. I understood very little Spanish at the time and could notreally defend myself against this tirade, which was probably merciful or I wouldhave been even more mortified. It was a useful lesson in the viciousness ofacademic discourse, and probably in my need for humility. Many years later, oneof Taussig’s students was in an ethnobotany course I taught in Ecuador, and hesuggested that I should not have felt singled out for persecution. Taussigtreated pretty much everyone that way, he said; it was just his style ofdiscourse.It didn’t really matter. I had come back to South Americ a for bigger thingsthan simply going to the conference. I had managed to raise enough funds tosupport six weeks of collecting in Peru following the conference. Eduardo hadinvited me to visit his ancestral home in Florencia, and I spent some time thereafter the conference. I then headed south to Iquitos, where I met up with twoIranian guys who had seen my talks in San Diego and were interested in learningabout ayahuasca and mushrooms. They had agreed to pay part of my travel expensesif I’d act as their guide for a couple of weeks and show them the ropes. Thiswent quite smoothly. By then Nicole was living in Iquitos, in a small casitainside a walled pension owned by the Schapers, an old Iquitos family, and wewere able to stay there as well. Mushrooms were easy enough to find in thepastures out along the highway, and we connected with a good ayahuasquero forseveral satisfying trips. The Iranians left happy.Eduard and I had arranged to meet in Pucallpa after I had finished in Iquitos,and I flew there and checked into the beloved El Pescador out near LagoYarinacocha. If corporate had sent down a memo to upgrade the place, it hadgotten lost in the mail. The hotel was as basic and shabby as it had been on myvisit four years earlier. They’d added another porcelain toilet, which wasperpetually clogged, and a small cantina with cervezas that were more or lesschilled, so I guess that qualified as improvement.The purpose of my trip was to reconnect with Francisco Montes Shuña, the cousinof Pablo Amaringo whom Terence and I had originally met during our search forthe elusive chagropanga in Tarapoto. Francisco had moved back to Pucallpa, andover the intervening years had collected live specimens of many medicinalplants, including a good selection of the “teacher plants” that Eduardo had beendocumenting. I planned to purchase these specimens from him and import them tothe States, clear them through the USDA facility in Los Angeles, and then shipthem on to Hawaii. The plan was for Luis Eduardo to join me in San Diego at theconclusion of our trip, pick up the collections in L.A. and transport them on toHawaii. All of this involved a lot less red tape than it would today. Terenceand Kat were temporarily living in the house they’d recently built on the BigIsland and were eager to receive the specimens.A secondary goal of our work in Pucallpa was to introduce Luis Eduardo to DonFidel, the ayahuasquero with whom both Terence and I had met earlier. LuisEduardo had been spending time with Don Emilio and other ayahuasqueros in hisfieldwork around Iquitos but had yet to visit Pucallpa. The visit was a chanceto renew contact with Don Fidel and benefit from his remarkable insights andskills.The most significant event of our stay in Pucallpa was unanticipated. I hadtaken Luis Eduardo to meet Francisco and his family and look at the plants hehad for us, ready to ship. Afterward, I suggested we stop by Pablo Amaringo’shouse, and we were lucky enough to catch him. Thanks to Luis Eduardo, I learneda number of things about Pablo I hadn’t gathered during our previousconversations. The big surprise was that Pablo had been a powerful ayahuasqueroyears earlier, but had given up that practice after getting into fights withother shamans, brujos, on the astral plane.Those familiar with the traditions of vegetalismo know that it has a seriousdark side. Much of the practice involves witchcraft and battles between shamans.The causes of illness and misfortune (which are viewed as aspects of the samething) are attributed not to physical causes but to magical ones. Brujos andbrujas are unscrupulous sorcerers or witches who harm their victims byintroducing the magical darts called virotes into their bodies. As I notedearlier, virotes are akin to pathogens or infectious agents, but they act on thepsychic plane. They are psychic darts that the shaman produces and keeps in hisphlegm. But like pathogens, they can cause physical and mental illnesses as wellas accidents and other misfortunes. A jealous lover, for example, might pay abrujo to project a virote into a rival for the affections of a husband orboyfriend, to harm them or make them regret their actions in some way. There isa strong element of jealousy and rivalry in mestizo society in Peru. If someonegains an advantage over another, for example, or is simply perceived to possessmore wealth or social status, it’s widely understood that they achieved itthrough skullduggery of some kind, not through hard work or good fortune. Thatperson then becomes a target for brujeria.Most vegetalistas are neither all good or all bad; they are “guns for hire,” andif one wants to put a spell on another, there are other vegetalistas that onecan pay to neutralize the spell, to grab the virote and send it back to theperson who intended the harm. It’s very much about power play, a shamanic armsrace. A shaman’s power is measured by how many teacher plants he or she hasmastered, how long he or she has kept the diet, and various other criteria. Ifyou suspect you have been hexed by an evil brujo or bruja, then you have to paya stronger, tougher shaman to protect you and deflect the energy back.All of this emerged in our conversation with Pablo. He had been a powerfulayahuasquero, he said, but had gotten into a battle with a bruja, a witch. Itbecame clear to him that if he stayed in the game he faced a choice: he eitherhad to kill her or be killed. Instead, he elected to step away. He stoppedpracticing. He no longer took ayahausca or used the power plants.Pablo also described to us how he had gotten involved in vegetalismo in thefirst place, which was another fascinating story. In his early twenties, hesaid, he had been diagnosed with an intractable heart defect. The physicianstold him there was nothing they could do; he had a congenital illness that wouldlikely shorten his life by several decades. He consulted an ayahuasquero as alast resort. After a series of powerful sessions, he was visited during oneceremony by a number of white-coated figures he described as “American doctors.”In his trance, he seemed to be lying on a table in a domed operating room,surrounded by high-tech equipment and these spirit healers. Disembodied, hewatched as they sliced open his chest and removed his heart. They held it upabove his chest and did things do it, making various incisions at strategicpoints, then they reimplanted it and closed up his chest. After that, heclaimed, his heart condition was cured and his human doctors could detect noheart murmur or other indications of a defective heart. Pablo’s tale resembledother stories in the mestizo ayahuasca tradition of “spirit doctors” performingmagical surgeries. Given the remarkable reports of physical and spiritualhealing that have been attributed to this medicine, perhaps there is somethingto it. It seems certain that we do not yet fully understand the dynamics ofshamanic healing.During our chat, Pablo brought out some of his paintings to show to us. Eduardoasked him if he’d ever tried to paint his ayahuasca visions. It was almost as ifa light had gone off in his head. No, he said, that had never really occurred tohim; but he was willing to give it a try. When we came to his house the nextmorning, he showed us two visionary ayahuasca paintings that he’d doneovernight. They were somewhat primitive and crude but affecting in theirsimplicity. It was indicative of Pablo’s innocence and complete lack of anycommercial motive that he had not even signed the paintings. A day later, he hadcreated two more. He gave two to me, and two to Eduardo, and the paintings thatPablo gifted to me have been proudly displayed in a place of honor in every homeI have lived in since then.Those four paintings marked the beginning of an extraordinary career. Pablo wenton to create hundreds of visionary paintings over the years until his death in2009. Luis Eduardo forged an alliance with Pablo and took on the role of hisagent. He found markets for his work and arranged exhibitions in Finland, LosAngeles, and Japan. Together, Pablo and Eduardo collaborated on one of the mostunique books ever created in the ethnographic literature, entitled AyahuascaVisions: the Religious Iconography of a Peruvian Shaman (1991). The bookconsists of full-color reproductions of forty-nine painted “visions” depictingvarious aspects of the ayahuasquero’s apprenticeship and practice ofvegitalismo. On each facing page, Luis Eduardo, writing in English, explains thevarious elements of the painting and their significance. These elements are notrandom, he notes. Every depicted plant, animal, and spirit has a symbolicsignificance and archetypal status in the mestizo belief system. The result is aremarkable window into the cosmology of contemporary mestizo shamanism andayahuasca’s place in it. By studying the paintings and their interpretation, onecould learn a great deal about what it takes to become an accomplishedvegetalista. Of course, the practice cannot be learned from a book alone, sincetwo essential elements would be missing: the master who teaches the apprentice,and the teacher plants themselves, particularly the plants used in makingayahuasca.In 1988, Pablo and Luis Eduardo co-founded the Usko-Ayar Amazonian School ofPainting, an art academy that in its early phases operated out of Pablo’s homeoutside Pucallpa. Admission was free to all the children of the village, and atone time some 300 students were enrolled to study painting under Pablo’stutelage. The art of the students was not visionary, but rather focused onremarkable depictions of the plants and animals of the rainforest, astonishingin their detail and accuracy. This ability seems innate among young people whogrow up surrounded by the natural environment, and whose perceptions are not“clouded” by literacy. Pablo, too, produced some hyper-realistic paintings, buthis stock-in-trade continued to be his visionary work. The school appeared to bea wonderful success. It gave many students a skill and a livelihood derived fromdepicting the rainforest rather than exploiting it. When tourists and outsidemarkets began to take notice, some students found they could make relativelygood money from the sale of their paintings. They (and their parents) began toappreciate the virtues of protecting the environment. A number of students wenton to become recognized artists. Meanwhile, the “Amaringo style” of paintingwould have its own lasting impact. Today, in galleries in Iquitos and Pucallpa,one can find the work of many who try to emulate that style, but few trulysucceed.Like many feel-good stories, this one ended sadly, at least for Luis Eduardo, ashe explained in a recent email. Beginning in 1988, he worked tirelessly topromote the school. He helped obtain a grant from the Finnish government tosupport the school and organized exhibitions and found buyers for the paintings.He bought high-quality art supplies for the students, photographed the paintingsfor promotional purposes and archiving, and wrote articles about the school invarious periodicals. He finally resigned in 1995, exhausted by internalsquabbles, and by the apparent misuse of the money he had raised by anindividual who was close to Pablo. He’d also grown concerned about Pablo’s useof the school as a platform to espouse his religious beliefs as he became moreinvolved with the Jehovah’s Witnesses. The final blows were the baselessaccusations leveled at him, Luis Eduardo wrote. The more money he brought to theschool, the more others suspected that he was putting money into his own pocket.He’d had enough.“The project was at the end for me completely unsustainable,” her explained. “Itwas totally pro bono. I did work as Pablo’s agent, but I never took anycommission from selling the art from the school, which was my way of doingsomething for the Amazon. My idea was the creation of a series of art schoolsand botanical gardens associated with them along the Ucayali and Amazon rivers,but it was impossible,” he concluded. Everywhere he went in the country inpursuit of his dream, he encountered people who sought to take advantage even asthey accused him personally of stealing.In 1995, he stopped selling Pablo’s work. The two briefly reconnected in 1998,though Luis Eduardo made it clear he wanted nothing more to do with the school.He had organized an exhibition for Pablo in London and was supposed to attendanother show for him in Japan. Instead, Pablo went there with someone elserepresenting him, with unfortunate results. As Luis Eduardo put it, “he did notsell a single painting, as his work is practically unintelligible without thecultural context I was providing.”The two men never did business again.Pablo received world recognition for the founding of Usko-Ayar, and for itscontributions to environmental awareness. At the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiroin 1992, he was awarded a place on the United Nations Environmental ProgramGlobal 500 Roll of Honor. Luis Eduardo was never acknowledged for hiscontributions. Over the years, we’ve worked together and shared numerousadventures. I regard Luis Eduardo as almost like a second brother to me, and oneof the most upright and ethical people I know. Once he stopped working topromote the school, others tried to do so, but the school eventually closedafter Pablo’s death. Long before those tensions, in 1985, Luis Eduardo and I had a remarkableexperience with Pablo, Don Fidel, and Francisco Montes. For me, the storyperfectly captures the mestizo worldview, in which the most mundane occurrencesare freighted with significance and the boundary separating ordinary andnon-ordinary reality is thin indeed.We had gone to Don Fidel’s simple dwelling a few times and undergone theayahuasca ceremony with him. His uncle, Don Jose, also an accomplishedayahuasquero, had been present at one of those sessions and invited Eduardo andme, along with Don Fidel, to come to his home the next evening and takeayahuasca again. We accepted the invitation and walked a considerable distanceoutside of town to Don Jose’s house, a modest structure even humbler than DonFidel’s, made of earthen bricks plastered over with adobe. There was also asmall walled garden. It was a cloudless night, and the moon was full.We gathered inside the one-room hut and drank the brew at about nine or a littlelater. It was a peaceful, meditative session; I didn’t have strong visions.After the effects had more or less passed, or so I thought, I went outside tohave a cigarette and get some fresh air. The night was bright; the swollen moonhad not yet set, and its light, falling through a small Brugmansia tree, castshadows of the branches on the hut’s adobe wall. I gazed at the wall while Ismoked my cigarette; then I did a double take. The shadows cast by the moonlightbore a striking resemblance to a human face! It looked like the face of a younggirl, wearing a veil over her long hair and with her hands folded in prayer. Ilooked away and looked again; it was definitely there. The resemblance wasunmistakable. I couldn’t quite believe what I was seeing, and I thought I washallucinating, though the effects had faded hours before. Finally I got up andwent back into the hut, and called Eduardo outside to have a look. He agreedthat it was remarkable. We both saw the same thing. We tucked that away anddidn’t think much about it for the rest of the evening. Later, we started ourlong walk back to the El Pescador, saying goodnight to Don Fidel, who saunteredtoward home in the other direction.The next morning, after breakfast, we went over to visit Pablo, who had some badnews. Francisco’s daughter, about five years old, had come down with severediarrhea the day before and had died about three a.m. The parents had searchedfor Don Fidel to get some treatment for her, but he was with us at Don Jose’s.They took the girl to the hospital, but the staff there was unable to provideany of the oral rehydration solution they needed to save her. It was very sadnews, but not uncommon in the area. Many young children die from intractablediarrhea and dehydration; the condition isn’t difficult to treat, but one musthave access to the remedy, and in this case, circumstances had preventedFrancisco from finding help for the girl. There would be a wake, a ceremony tobless the little girl, at Francisco’s home that evening.When we arrived at the house to pay our respects, everyone was dressed in theirfinest “church” clothes. We walked into the room where the little girl was laidout in a kind of crib or small bed. She was dressed in a white dress, her headwas covered with a white veil, and her hands were folded in prayer over herchest. Her eyes were closed, and there was a peaceful expression on her face.The image of her there before me was an exact match to what I had seen in theshadow cast by the moon on the wall the night before. Both Eduardo and I werestruck by the resemblance. The little girl had died about three or four in themorning, which corresponded closely to the hour I was sitting in the gardengazing at the image. It was just that and no more. The memory has stayed with meall these years. Nothing evokes the dreamlike nature of the magical realitythat, for these people, is reality, as much as this incident. Toward the middle of August, we completed our business in Pucallpa and preparedall the live plants we had collected for export. At the time, this was quiteeasy to do if you had the proper permits. You needed phytosanitary certificatesfrom the Peruvian government, and USDA plant import permits, all of which wehad. Peruvian permits are not so easy to obtain these days, due to concernsabout biopiracy. On the Hawaiian side, importing alien species is now almostimpossible, and rightly so, given that every non-native species has thepotential to become invasive.Even then, the specimens for export had to be prepared for suboptimal conditionsduring transport and the horrible things that were done to them on the receivingend by the USDA plant import authorities. Our method was to buy a large wovenbasket at the market, about three feet tall, with a lid that could be lashed on.We cleaned and washed all the cuttings, wrapped them in damp muslin, and putthose in the basket, along with packets of seeds that needed to remain moist.After lashing up the basket, I treated it as part of my luggage. In Lima, nobodyeven looked at it except for a young policeman with an AK-47, who took onedesultory glance inside and waved me through.In Los Angeles, it was a different story. I dropped off the collections alongwith our documents at the USDA import facility, where the staff unwrapped allthe collections and fumigated them. I had presented phytosanitary certificatesand requested that the collections not be fumigated, but the staff didn’tlisten. I really believe that the USDA does its best to kill all live plantimports; that’s their job, as they see it. Once the cuttings had been unwrappedand fumigated, they were dumped back into the basket (no one bothered to wrapthem again) and left to sit for about a week until we were notified that theywere ready for pick-up. Luis Eduardo then flew with them to Hawaii, but by thetime they arrived, nearly all the cuttings had lost their leaves and looked likedead sticks, for the most part. With careful tending from Terence and Kat, abouthalf of the plants survived.By then, in 1985, Terence and Kat had turned nine acres of the land they’dacquired on the Big Island into an ethnobotanical reserve. They also foundedBotanical Dimensions, a nonprofit organization based in California whose missionwas “to collect, protect, propagate and understand ethnomedically significantplants and their lore,” as noted on its website (Botanicaldimensions.org). Asits president and project director, Kat ran the nonprofit from the start,managing the Hawaii site and applying for grants. That remains true today. Overthe years, the organization has used grants and contributions to completeprojects ranging from watershed restoration to ethnobotanical research in theAmazon.Back in 1985, Botanical Dimensions provided me with the cachet and destination Ineeded to import the plants I had collected in Peru. Since the days when Kat andTerence first began their gene bank in the Hawaiian rainforest, many of itsearliest arrivals have reached maturity, and there are now many species of rarePeruvian medicinal plants in the garden, along with specimens from elsewhere onthe planet. The site has played an important role in the ethnobotany courses Katteaches, including “Plants in Human Affairs,” which we have taught togethersince 2002. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 45 - The Perpetual Postdoc I began making plans to leave the Helicon Foundation soon after I returned toSan Diego. By then, the papers I’d written on the results of my thesis work hadstirred quite a bit of interest. I’d gotten numerous reprint requests, includingone from Dr. Juan Saavedra, a section chief in the Laboratory of ClinicalPharmacology at the National Institute of Mental Health, or NIMH.Saavedra’s name seemed familiar to me, then I remembered: he’d been a colleagueof Julius Axelrod, the Nobel Prize–winning neuroscientist who had donepioneering work elucidating the molecular basis of neurotransmission. Axelrodwas one of the giants of neuroscience. He and Saavedra had published an earlypaper on the endogenous synthesis of DMT, characterizing the enzymes in ratbrains, human brains, and other tissues that used tryptamine and serotonin tomake DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, melatonin, and other neurohormones (Saavedra and Axelrod,1972). Saavedra had requested a reprint of my paper on ayahuasca from theJournal of Ethnopharmacology. If he’s crazy enough to ask for that, I figured,maybe he’s crazy enough to take me on as a postdoc. I wanted to redirect myefforts toward psychedelic research, toward something that ideally would combinepharmacology, which I wanted to learn, and ethnobotany, which I had crediblydone.I sent him the reprint along with a polite letter mentioning my supervisor, NeilTowers, and my mentor, Schultes, and inquired if there might be an opportunityto work in his lab at NIMH on some aspects of ayahuasca pharmacology. At thetime, I was unaware that Saavedra had been one of the scientists from theNational Institutes of Health (NIH) that joined the RV Alpha Helix expedition tothe Amazon in 1977. Schultes had been chief science officer on the expedition,and Neil had been selected to go, along with the NIH chemist John W. Daly, whoachieved fame for his pioneering work on frog venom alkaloids. Saavedra had beenselected because of his work on endogenous tryptamines and also because of hisSouth American (Argentinian) heritage.In response to my note, Saavedra sent back a letter encouraging me to apply to aprogram at NIH, the Pharmacology Research Associate Traineeship, or PRAT, afellowship for young investigators who were outside the field of pharmacologybut wanted to acquire skills in that discipline. I applied in the fall of 1985.The application process involved selecting three potential supervisors in orderof preference, and then visiting the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland forinterviews. Naturally, I selected Saavedra as my first choice, followed byAxelrod and John Daly. I had an interesting interview with Axelrod, in which wediscussed the function of endogenous DMT. In other words, why was DMT naturallypresent in the human brain? He said that he thought it had no function; it wasbasically metabolic “noise,” which surprised me.It was clear from the start that my supervisor would be Saavedra. He hadencouraged me to apply, he had the connection to Schultes and Towers, and he hadan interest in ayahuasca. It wasn’t clear what we would work on together, butthere were many possibilities. It seemed likely our project would somehowinvolve the endogenous synthesis of tryptamines and beta-carbolines.I returned from my visit quite stoked; I had a dawning belief that with a littleluck, and hard work, my career might actually go somewhere. In mid-February1986, I learned I’d been accepted into the program. Sheila took a week off fromher job and went out to Washington, D.C. and Bet hesda to find a position in oneof the hospitals there. Going out on her own was a good experience for her. TheUnited States was still a foreign and slightly threatening country to her at thetime, but surviving her “expedition to America” was a tremendousconfidence-builder. She interviewed at four or five hospitals in the Washingtonarea and was offered positions at all of them. She elected to work at one of thearea’s biggest inner-city hospitals; she thought the diversity of both thepatient population and the staff would be more interesting, and she was right.The hospital’s clientele included many of the most disenfranchised of the urbanpoor. The health effects of violence, crack addiction, and AIDS were destined tobecome familiar sights in the course of her work.Our transition to Bethesda became our American pilgrimage, a chance to discoverthe country together and to discover each other more in the process. During ourtwo years in San Diego, we’d gone through one beater after another, so at thestart of our journey we bought our first new car, a 1986 Honda Accord. We feltvery much like upwardly mobile young marrieds, which we were. We took off inmid-May for three weeks of travel before we were due at our respective jobs.We stopped to see the 200-inch Hale telescope at Palomar, a mecca for the kidastronomer in me still enthralled with outer space. Sheila had never seenEsalen, so we headed up Highway 1 along the coast to Big Sur and pulled in therefor a look at that observatory of inner space, as well. In Santa Cruz, wedropped in on my Aunt Tress, then drove through San Francisco and across theGolden Gate Bridge, pulling in for a few days with Terence and Kat. Moving on,we reached Vancouver eager to see Expo 86 and our old friends, by thengrad-school survivors and more or less gainfully employed. We spent a couple ofnights with Sheila’s parents in their place outside Kamloops, and then droppedin on her sister in Slocan, a village in the pretty Kootenay region ofsoutheastern British Columbia.Another long leg took us through Idaho to Utah, where we gave ourselves a day togawk at the Mormon Temple and Salt Lake, then moved on, clearing our heads inGoblin Valley State Park, a lonely, weird place with lots of mushroom-shapedrock formations carved by the wind. The opening scene of the cheesy psychedelicmovie Altered States was shot there, the only thing good about the film. I’msure it would be most interesting to chomp down five grams or so in the GoblinValley around dusk, but we had miles ahead of us and shoved on. Moab, SpanishFork, Monticello, Dove Creek, Cortez—this was familiar territory to me, evokingmemories of the weekend trips our family had taken to Arches National Monumentor Mesa Verde, flitting in and out like celestial beings on the shining wings ofDad’s little plane, insulated from the mundane concerns of the folks who livedin that beautiful but harsh and arid land.Sheila and I visited some of the earliest attempts at building a life there: theAnasazi ruins at Mesa Verde and Hovenweep. We then turned north and stayed a fewdays with my Aunt Mayme in Paonia, my first chance to introduce Sheila to myextended family. With our time growing short, we surmounted the Rockies anddashed to St. Louis, and then on from there, finally reaching greaterWashington, D.C. in sweltering rush-hour traffic like neither of us had everseen before.Within a few days, we’d found a funky place on a nice dead-end, leafy streetlined with older townhouse-style quadriplexes, about half a block from theBethesda Metro. The NIH was one stop north. Bethesda is a nice place to live,especially if you like good food. Our two-year stint there was destined to beone of the best times of our lives. When I had applied for the fellowship at NIMH, Saavedra and I had discusseddoing some research related to tryptamines and beta-carbolines, and building onthe research he’d done years earlier on the endogenous synthesis of DMT. He wasinterested in ayahuasca. We thought that endogenous ayahuasca analogs involvingboth tryptamines and beta-carbolines might be produced in the brain under somecircumstances, and this seemed like a promising avenue for investigation. As itturned out, I ended up working on an entirely different problem, unrelated toayahuasca or natural products, but it was still a useful experience.At the time, there was a lot of interest in neuroscience in characterizingneurotransmitter receptor subtypes using subtype-selective drugs. For example, acompound that selectively bound to a particular subtype of a receptor for theneurotransmitter serotonin, or 5HT, could be labeled with radioactive isotopeslike tritium or iodine 125. Equipped with these radioactive labels, a researchercould use receptor-binding assays to do some interesting things. One couldcharacterize the molecular properties of receptors in brain tissue, forinstance, or compare the affinity of an unlabeled drug for a particular receptortype by determining how much of it was needed to displace a labeled drug fromthe binding site. The technique had been developed by Solomon Snyder and hisstudent Candace Pert, whose landmark work on opiate receptors led to theisolation of the brain’s own morphine—the endogenous opiate peptides known asenkephalins and endorphins. Snyder and Pert had developed this methodology inthe early seventies at Johns Hopkins, and it had since revolutionizedneuroscience. [images/00024.jpg]> Sheila and Dennis, about 1993. During my time at NIMH, and later at Stanford, many investigators were busyusing these radioactively “hot” molecular probes to fish for new receptorsubtypes of the major known neurotransmitters. Serotonin receptors were gettinga lot of attention because of their known or suspected role in brain disorderssuch as depression and schizophrenia.Serotonin receptors also appeared to play a role in the psychedelic response.Research dating back to the fifties had demonstrated that drugs like LSD actedon serotonin receptors; but no one knew exactly which receptor subtypes LSD andother psychedelics targeted, let alone how these subtypes were affected. The“hallucinogen receptor” became the object of a quest. Various subtypes wereproposed as the likely culprits. By the time I arrived at NIMH, in 1986, aconsensus was emerging that the hallucinogens acted as “agonists,” at oneparticular serotonin subtype, the so-called 5HT2A receptors. (In pharmacology,an “agonist” is a drug that binds to a receptor and initiates an effect, oftenacting in a way that is similar to the native neurotransmitter. The oppositetype, “antagonists” block the binding of the native neurotransmitter but do nothave any effect themselves.)As luck had it, some of the so-called “psychedelic amphetamines” developed by mycolleague and mentor, Sasha Shulgin, happened to display extraordinaryselectivity for the 5HT2A receptor subtypes. Shulgin’s compounds were calledamphetamines because they relied on a basic amphetamine structure, but they didnot act as stimulants. They were really mescaline analogs, and some were almostpure 5HT2A receptor agonists. Conveniently, one of the most effective in thisregard was an “iodinated” analog of the mega-hallucinogen known topharmacologists as DOM, and more widely as STP after its notorious appearance onthe street in the late sixties. Its iodinated derivative was known as DOI.Because DOI included an iodine atom, highly radioactive forms of the compoundcould be synthesized using isotopes like iodine 125. This “hot” tag or labelwould allow us to track where this compound bound in neural tissue.Until then, these “receptor-binding assays” were usually carried out inhomogenous tissue, that is, in tissue that had been blended like a smoothie intoa liquid. After tagging, the labeled receptor fragments were filtered out, andthe amount of bound drug could be determined by measuring the radioactivitylevels. By the time I joined Saavedra’s lab, he was just starting to use atechnique known as autoradiography, which added a new dimension to how receptorscould be characterized: researchers could now map receptor distribution inslices of brain tissue.In autoradiography, the tissue, for example a rat’s brain, is frozen in liquidnitrogen and then sliced into extremely thin sections using a special cuttingtool called a microtome. The slices are mounted on glass slides and incubated inbuffer containing the radioactive drug, which binds to the receptors. Followingincubation, each slide is exposed to radiation-sensitive film in a specialcassette that holds the adjacent slide and film in place. Exposure can take awhile. The film, once developed, bears a perfect a black-and-gray photographicnegative of the brain slice. This image can be scanned with a densitometer, andthe concentration of bound drug in a given region can be calculated based on thedarkness of the image. Iodine 125 and other radioactive gamma-ray emitters areperfect for autoradiography because they expose the X-ray film in a matter ofdays instead of weeks or months as is required for drugs labeled with lessradioactive tags such as tritium.Most of my postdoc colleagues were working with these techniques on atrialnatriuretic peptide, a potent vasodilator important in the regulation ofcardiac, renal, and vascular functions. I got to work on hallucinogen receptors,which I thought were much sexier. The compound we intended to use, DOI, occursin two configurations, each a mirror image of the other. The R(-) “enantiomer”readily binds to 5HT2A receptors, while its mirror image, the S(+) enantiomer,doesn’t bind or binds only at high concentrations. This correlates with theirknown effects in humans: R(-) DOI is strongly psychoactive at less than onemilligram, while S(+) DOI is essentially inactive.Thanks to our connections to the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, notablyShulgin, we were able to get hold of both enantiomers in hot and cold forms.With these molecules in hand, I could answer some interesting questions aboutthe distribution and function of 5HT2A receptors, at least in rat brains. Iwon’t go into the details; the curious can read the papers I published withSaavedra and others, which are listed in the bibliography. Our key finding wasthat cold R(-)DOI would displace its hot form from specific sites in the ratbrain slices; but when hot LSD was used to label the binding sites instead, thencold DOI would displace it from a subset of receptors in certain brain regions,although from not all of them. Conversely, cold LSD would displace all of theDOI binding sites, and more besides; these extra sites were not 5HT2A bindingsites, and LSD is not 5HT2A-selective compared to DOI.In retrospect, these findings seem almost trivial, and perhaps they are. Butthey were important at the time, because they demonstrated that twohallucinogens, having very different molecular structures, nonetheless occupiedthe same receptor sites, and their localization in different brain regionsmatched closely. It was a solid contribution to the field, if not exactly thesort of finding that would get one “the call” from Stockholm.At NIMH, I was reminded that when people work closely together, it’s thepsychodynamics that are most problematic. As a graduate student, I’d been luckyto have amazing mentors in the persons of Sandy Siegel and Neil Towers, but Inever enjoyed anything close to that rapport with my various postdocsupervisors. Saavedra and I had a number of clashes during my tenure there; mostinvolved my insistence on listing those at Lawrence Berkeley who had synthesizedthe labeled compounds we relied on in our research as coauthors on the papersthat Saavedra and I published. From my perspective, they’d done us a big favorin providing us with a set of crucial molecular tools, but my supervisor saw itotherwise. Our disagreement suggested a philosophical difference, to somedegree. I viewed science as inherently a team effort that relied oncollaboration to get things done. Others adhered to a more competitive model.Despite our disagreements, we published a number of interesting papers over whatI believe was a productive relationship for the two years I spent there.Most of the postdocs in the lab were foreigners, Japanese or Finnish orArgentinian, working under guest visas. Being transplants from elsewhere, webanded together and became excellent friends. Sheila invited the postdocs andtheir families to our tiny apartment for a traditional, Canadian-American styleThanksgiving dinner the first year we were there. We loved introducing them towhat might well have been as exotic a meal as they’d ever been served.That first year, I ran an incubation experiment over the holidays that requiredme to come to the lab at about eleven and shut it down for the night. OnChristmas Eve, Building 10, the enormous Clinical Research Center where Iworked, was mostly dark, but there was a light coming out of our lab. Sitting atthe bench beside mine was Kazuto, an older Japanese postdoc, a cool guy, butquite reserved and a very hard worker. He had a wife and children living withhim in Bethesda, but it seemed he rarely saw them. On a normal morning, I’d getto my bench about eight. Kazuto would already be at his bench, and had been forhours. I’d leave for the evening around six, and he’d still be there. Thatnight, at eleven, on Christmas Eve, there was Kazuto, hunched over his work.“For God’s sake, “ I said, “why don’t you go home to your family? After all,it’s Christmas Eve.” To which he replied, “Well, I am Japanese. It doesn’t meanso much to me. I would rather be here.” I could hardly keep from cracking up; itwas so matter-of-fact and true to his own character.In fact, all of us were workaholics who had more or less renounced the conceptof “after work.” But as an American, my situation was somewhat different. Mostof my cohorts were foreigners working under guest visas who, as a result, wereunder even more pressure than I was. Their visa status depended on the good willof their supervisors, so it was in their interests to keep their heads down andtoe the line. I had to wonder how this power dynamic affected the research.During my years after graduate school, I’d have many such glimpses into thenature of science conducted in corporate and institutional settings.So, despite some rocky episodes, my postdoc at the NIMH would be a productiveand solid start along a career path I actually wanted to pursue. By the end, I’dbeen able to parley that experience into yet another postdoc in the Departmentof Neurology at Stanford University under Dr. Stephen Peroutka, a well-knownresearcher in the serotonin field. At least I had answered the question I’doccasionally heard at NIMH: What’s a botanist doing in the Laboratory ofClinical Neuropharmacology? The answer: surviving, and trying to do reasonablycompetent work. I managed to do both. Sometime during our second August in Bethesda, “we” became pregnant. Rather,Sheila became pregnant with my help. We had both been enjoying our status as awell-employed young marrieds with no kids and two cats. We could go out everyweekend if we felt in the mood, and we often were, dining out at some ofBethesda’s tremendous restaurants. But there was something missing. I thoughtthat we should try to have a baby, but Sheila was not so sure, perhaps having awoman’s keener sense of who did most of the work during, and after, pregnancy.Nevertheless, one night we did try, and we’d chosen our moment well. Forty-twoweeks later, on May 6, 1988, our daughter Caitlin was born. I was in thebirthing room with Sheila and cut the umbilical cord. I have never been higherin my life, never experienced a sense of ecstasy that even came close to what Ifelt at that moment. I’m still high from it, and I hope I always will be.Caitlin is the best thing that ever happened to me, and to us.It was clear from the start that Caitlin was special. Maybe in some otherdimension there’s an Oort Cloud of drifting souls awaiting their chance to beincarnated. Every once in a while, with the appearance of suitable parents, oneof those souls will split off from the crowd and plunge into the inner solarsystem, so to speak, and take up residence in the mother’s womb. I’d like tothink that’s how it happened with Cait. She is an “old soul,” clear-eyed andintelligent from the start; and our purpose in life, to the degree that we hadone, has been to provide this amazing being with a chance to enter and flourishin this world under our love and care. Twenty-four years later, our efforts havepaid off. She is kind and intelligent, compassionate and beautiful; everything afather could want in a daughter, and we are blessed to have her. She is now anadult, as much a friend and mentor as our child, and one of the most interestingpeople I know.As I recall it, when Caitlin first began to talk, she didn’t start out callingus “Mama” or “Dada,” but rather “Dennis” and “Sheila.” She eventually settled on“Mom” and “Dad” like any other kid would, but I’ve always interpreted thatearlier phase as evidence for the old-soul hypothesis. It was like she waschecking us out at first, seeing if we were suitable vessels for herincarnation. Then I guess she decided that we’d do and settled into being ourkid. I give thanks every day to whatever merciful beings there are in thisuniverse that she decided to stick around.Cait’s hospital birth wasn’t typical, or perhaps it was, making it a sadcommentary on the way a normal, natural process is routinely over-medicalized.When she was about two weeks overdue, Sheila’s obstetrician advised us that itwas time to induce labor. We knew the result of that might be rough. Sheila madeit clear that she wanted to breastfeed, and to have a natural, drug-free birthif possible. The nurses were not supportive. At the height of Sheila’s labor,when she was in the most pain and ready to throw in the towel, the nurses kepturging her to have an epidural, a rather new pain-control method at the time. Iwas there with her, and so was Kat, who had come out to help us. We both urgedSheila to hang in and refuse the meds, but the nurses undermined her resolve atthe height of her vulnerability. Thankfully, the birth proceeded withoutcomplications.Cait was born about six in the evening. Afterward, when all of us were gatheredin Sheila’s hospital room, I was swept by the feeling of being in the presenceof a new life. If you’ve never experienced that for yourself, there is no way toconvey it. I remember a sense of warmth and heightened colors, along with apervading mood of calm, peace, and love. It was a lot like being on a low doseof MDMA only much, much better. I suspect there are hormonal and pheromonalreactions in the mother and father and others present that create this ambiance.Kat was the perfect companion at this pivotal, life-defining event; she knewjust what to do and how to support us at every turn. I had a very real sense ofthe power of the feminine in that room. I was humbly reminded that there is noevent more evocative of the sacred mystery of life than giving birth, a miraclethat only women can fully know.Sheila initiated breastfeeding right away. She had been reading up and takingclasses, so she knew what to do, and it seemed to be going well. We had beenvery clear that we were going with breast milk only; no formula or other liquidswere to be administered. By the time Kat and I left the hospital late thatnight, Sheila was tired and Cait was sleeping after a good feed. I too wasexhausted and desperate for sleep, but when I left the hospital I felt like Iwas walking two feet above the ground.About one a.m. we got a call from Sheila; she was hysterical and crying. She haddeveloped a low fever, which is common after an epidural and rarely anything tobe concerned about. The nurses had interpreted this as a likely infection, andhad used that as an excuse to seize Caitlin and spirit her off to the nursery,to “protect” her, they said, from being infected. Once in the nursery, theyimmediately fed her formula, against our explicit instructions.Sheila was upset and furious. Not only had her baby been ripped from her armsfor no reason; she was then dispatched to the nursery and fed toxic formulaagainst our wishes. In the emotionally volatile state that Sheila was inalready, I could see how upsetting this was for her. But there was nothing wecould do. We couldn’t go back to the hospital that night, so we managed to calmSheila and get the obstetrician to allow her to go home in the morning. Indeed,we packed up and left just over twelve hours after Sheila had given birth.Once at home, the breastfeeding went great, and the bonding continued. It was amagical weekend, and it changed both of us forever; being parents will do that.One consequence was that Sheila became impassioned about breastfeeding. In theyears when Cait was young and still breastfeeding, Sheila got involved in LaLeche League and went on to lead breastfeeding groups wherever we’ve lived sincethen. Sheila eventually used her experience with breastfeeding, her botanicaltraining, and her knowledge of herbal medicine to write a book about herbs andtheir use as aids in breastfeeding. The result, The Nursing Mother’s Herbal,received a prestigious award as the best new publication in consumer health in2004 from the American Nurses Association (Humphrey, 2003).Now Sheila has combined her personal knowledge and her professionalqualifications as an RN and IBCLC (International Board Certified LactationConsultant) into a career as a lactation consultant at a hospital near our homein Minnesota. This work has become a kind of crusade for her. She is aspassionate about breastfeeding as I ever was about psychedelics. There arecertain similarities in how these subjects are viewed by the biomedicalestablishment. Both have the potential to benefit physical and mental health.Both also exist in the shadows of biomedicine, and have been viewed as highlysuspect by “conventional” medicine. I am told the situation is getting betterfor breastfeeding, in light of the overwhelming clinical evidence for itsbenefits. And yet most physicians know far too little about the subject.Something similar could be said of what most medical professionals know aboutpsychedelics, and many are so misinformed as to be unqualified to say anythingabout them at all. Two weeks after Caitlin’s birth I left for the Bay Area to find us a place tolive and get ready to start my new postdoc at Stanford. Sheila stayed inBethesda. On my drive in the Honda, I stopped in West Lafayette, Indiana tovisit Dave Nichols at his lab at Purdue University. Nichols was a medicinalchemist who, like Shulgin, had focused his research on structure-activityinvestigations of psychedelics. Unlike Shulgin, however, he had far better toolsat his disposal in his well-funded lab at Purdue, so he was able to carry hiswork much farther than Shulgin was able to do. I’d met him at the psychedelicsconference at Esalen four years earlier, and even discussed the idea of doing apostdoc at his lab at one time, before circumstances led me elsewhere.What I found at Purdue was certainly an interesting scene. This was the place tobe if you had a serious interest in psychedelics. He and his graduate studentswere actively involved in pursuing studies on the molecular characterization ofthe 5HT2A receptors, developing animal behavioral protocols to assess theactivity of new compounds, and studying the structure-activity relationships ofpsychedelics in all classes. They had it all: medicinal chemistry, pharmacology,animal models—not to mention an ever-changing pool of students who loved Daveand were happy to put in long hours in the lab. He was passionate about hiswork, and it was infectious. Dave’s group was on the cutting edge ofneuropharmacology and many of his graduate students went on to make their markon the field. It was a stimulating research environment, and I left a littlejealous. But I had my own career track to pursue at Stanford, and I was eager toget started.Once I got to the Bay Area, I quickly found a house to rent in Redwood City, andSheila and Cait flew out to join me. Sheila and I had agreed that she would be astay-at-home mom for as long as we could afford it. Not having two incomescaused some economic hardship, but we have never regretted the choice of givingour daughter the benefit of a mother’s presence for the first twelve years ofher life.I saved a little money by taking the bus to work as far as I could, and thenwalking the last leg to the lab. My new supervisor, Stephen Peroutka, was a fewyears younger than I was and yet already an up-and-comer in the serotonin field.We’d met at the annual Society for Neuroscience meeting in New Orleans sixmonths earlier and hit it off. He was also interested in serotonin receptorsubtypes and wanted to further characterize the 5HT2A receptors with the new“hot” iodinated DOI. Like many other investigators, he was also getting veryinterested in MDMA.New evidence was emerging that MDMA, by then illegal, was selectively neurotoxicto certain serotonin neurons, at least in rats and primates. Meanwhile, MDMA wasbecoming increasingly popular as a “club drug,” and law enforcement authoritieshad begun to voice concern about having another drug-abuse “epidemic” on theirhands. That, plus the indications of neurotoxicity, meant there was lots offunding through the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and other agenciesto investigate the neurotoxic effects of MDMA.Steve’s lab was all over this. We co-wrote a definitive review of the currentunderstanding of MDMA neurotoxicity, and that became my first publication fromhis lab, and the first paper to be published in Journal of Neurochemistry inJanuary 1989. Later in my postdoc, with Shulgin’s help, I published a paper onthe structure-activity relationships of a series of MDMA analogs, correlatingtheir effect on the release of tritiated dopamine and serotonin from rat brainsynaptosomes, with differential neurotoxicity in rats. To put that simply, I waslooking at whether these ecstasy-like compounds damaged rat brain nerve cells.It turned out to be a nice piece of work. Peroutka didn’t sign on as a coauthor,but he let me publish it together with Shulgin and another postdoc.I don’t recall why he chose not to join in the publication. I do know that bythen MDMA was a political football in science. Any findings that suggested alack of neurotoxicity, let alone that—gasp—the substance might even havetherapeutic benefits, were heresy. According to our results, many of the analogswe tested had little or no neurotoxicity—findings that were not in synch withconventional wisdom or the expectations of the funding agencies. In a letterthat appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in late 1987, Peroutkanoted that a survey of 369 Stanford undergraduates found that 39 percent of themhad tried ecstasy at least once. I suspect he took some heat for that.For me, the MDMA work was interesting but not really my main focus. I was stillinterested in characterizing the 5HT2A receptor subtypes, and learning moreabout the applications of the receptor-binding techniques. Steve’s lab was theperfect place to do that. There were four or five other postdocs as well asundergrads working in the lab. The place was a paper mill; if we didn’t submit apaper at least once a week, we weren’t working hard enough. I don’t mean that Ihad to submit a paper, but collectively the lab had to keep pace.In this competitive environment, with its emphasis on the quantity of scientificpublications, quality may have been compromised at times. At the time, all kindsof novel subtypes for various neurotransmitters were being described in theliterature, and the serotonin field was particularly active in this regard.Steve was very interested in discovering new 5HT receptor subtypes, and indeedhad already done so. He really wanted to find a new hallucinogen-specific 5HT2subtype, and that was the task we diligently, if not obsessively, pursued. Theconsensus among most neuroscientists involved in this work was that the 5HT2Aselective agonists like DOI bound to a high affinity conformation of thereceptor, not to a distinct receptor for such compounds. This was the currentunderstanding of the molecular pharmacology of the 5HT2A receptors at the time,and it made sense. But Steve insisted that what the radio-labeled agonists hadindicated was a distinct subtype—that is, the “real” hallucinogen receptor.After I learned more about the high-affinity agonist binding characteristics ofthe 5HT2A receptor, it was clear that we had embarked on a wild goose chase insearch of this mythical receptor. Other papers we turned out were better,including one in which we screened a series of tryptamine analogs against 5HT2Aand 5HT1A receptors (McKenna et al. 1990). This one received kudos from DaveNichols at Purdue, which made me very happy.After our return to California, we lived for about a year in Redwood City andthen rented a house in Menlo Park near East Palo Alto, which for a while backthen was known as the country’s “murder capitol.” Despite its location, thehouse was wonderful, a Spanish Colonial Revival place built in the mid-1920swith a big unkempt backyard, an old chicken shed and other outbuildings, roomfor a big garden, and even its own well. The place had been a part of anintentional community formed by a group of freethinkers who supported biodynamicgardening and communal living. Our dwelling had been one of several smallhousehold farms in a loose-knit cooperative whose families shared their skillsand resources to support each other while selling produce in San Francisco. Ourhouse, which we called “Housie” at Cait’s insistence, was the rare spread thatwas still more or less intact. It was a great place for Caitlin and our twocats, and we loved it.When we first came to the Bay Area, we hardly knew anyone, other than Terenceand Kat; they lived up north in Sonoma County, and we saw them infrequently. Ourlimited social life suited us, but we looked forward to the occasional Fridaynight dinners organized by Sasha Shulgin and his wife, Anne, for the crème de lacrème of Bay Area psychedelic society. These potluck affairs usually took placeat a beautiful home in the hills above Marin that belonged to Anne’s ex-husband.It was only through the kindness of Sasha and Anne that we were invited. We knewwe had found a compatible bunch of friends when they not only encouraged us tobring Caitlin to these events, but made a big deal over her when we showed up.She would crawl around underneath the tables and chairs and through a forest ofadult legs; nobody ever stepped on her as far as I know and everyone would finda chance to pick her up and engage with her. Sasha and Anne, the quintessence ofan earth mother, were especially fond of her. Sasha, with his twinkling eyes,halo of wild white hair and beard, may as well have been Santa Claus as far asCait was concerned. Cait never had much of a chance to be close to hergrandparents on either side of our family, so Sasha and Anne were the idealsurrogates. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 46 - Climbing the Vine: 1991 [images/00031.jpg]> Preparing hoasca at the UDV temple in Manaus, Brazil. My seemingly perpetual status as a postdoc came to an end sometime in the springof 1990. Peroutka was about to leave Stanford for a plum position as thedirector of neuroscience at Genentech, the first of several positions he’d go onto hold in the world of corporate biomedicine. He told me that I should startmaking plans to find a real job, if such was to be had. I had been applying forvarious academic positions, but none of the recruiting committees seemed to knowquite how to respond to my peculiar academic pedigree as abotanist/neuroscientist with a passionate interest in psychedelics. I was readyto move on from Stanford, because I wanted to find a way to merge my newlyacquired skills in neuroscience and central nervous system (CNS) pharmacologywith my longstanding interests in ethnobotany and natural products. But the wayforward wasn’t clear, and I was worried about finding the next gig.Then, a lucky break: I was contacted by Mark Plotkin, a Yale ethnobotanist andprotégé of Schultes who would soon achieve national fame for his 1993 book Talesof a Shaman’s Apprentice: an Ethnobotanist Searches for New Medicines in theAmazon Rainforest. We had met briefly when I attended a presentation he made atNIH. There was a new startup company being formed in the Bay Area called ShamanPharmaceuticals, he said, and its mission was focused on ethnobotanically drivendrug discovery, especially drugs from the Amazon Basin. They already had oneantiviral candidate in the pipeline, and were planning to create a CNS drugdiscovery program. They needed young, smart, ambitious people like me.Shaman Pharmaceuticals was the visionary brainchild of Lisa Conte, an ambitiousyoung entrepreneur who had been a vice-president at a venture capital firm withoffices in the area. She had managed to garner about $4 million in venturecapital funding as well as personal funds and had founded Shaman after observinglocal healers using plant medicines during travels in Asia. Schultes, and laterthe famous pharmacognosist Norman Farnsworth, were persuaded to join theiradvisory board. At the time, Conte needed people to join the core team, Marktold me, and they were hiring. I should go talk to her, which I did.For me, it was like a dream come true. Ever since San Diego, I had made effortsto found a company that would do exactly what Shaman Pharma intended to do. Ihad good ideas for drug discovery but no business experience or expertisewhatever. Now here was a new company run by those with the business skills torealize what I had only dreamed of doing. Moreover, I had something to offer, inthe form of the skills I had developed during my postdocs at NIMH and Stanford.Although their primary therapeutic target was antivirals, they also wereinterested in novel analgesics and needed people to work in both areas.My stint at Shaman would be my introduction to corporate science. I stayed withthe company until the end of 1992 and enjoyed my work there. The otherscientists, with some exceptions, were a good bunch to work with, and webelieved in our mission. I felt like I had a contribution to make.For most of my tenure at Shaman I was a lab rat, working in the receptor lab onthe lower floor of their facility in San Carlos. Other Shamanites got to travelthe world in search of exotic plants, a role I might have envied had I not beenso happy to stay at home with my wife and young daughter.In 1991, I did escape temporarily, thanks to an invitation I got to describe mywork on ayahuasca at a conference in São Paulo, Brazil. The conference had beenorganized by the medical studies section of the União do Vegetal, or UDV, one ofthe syncretic churches in Brazil that uses ayahuasca as a sacrament. (Ayahuasca,in Portuguese, is called hoasca, and UDV followers often refer to it asvegetal). The conference was a multidisciplinary event that included chemists,neuroscientists, pharmacologists, anthropologists, and psychiatrists. My friendLuis Eduardo was there along with other knowledgeable figures.For the UDV, it was an important event, given its political subtext. At thetime, CONFEN, the Brazilian drug agency, was debating whether ayahuasca was adangerous substance liable to abuse, and whether its use in religious practicesshould be banned. The UDV wanted to show that hoasca was inherently safe, notsubject to abuse, and that its ritual use should be allowed. By inviting adistinguished roster of international experts, they hoped to present animpressive conference that would favorably influence the CONFEN authorities. Itseemed strange to me that I was regarded as one such “distinguished” expert onayahuasca, but I suppose I was.During our travels in Peru in 1985, Eduardo and I had both mused about thepossibility of conducting a biomedical study of ayahuasca. Many of theayahuasqueros we dealt with seemed remarkably healthy in mind and body, andmany, though quite elderly, were still quite strong. We asked a naive question:was there something about long-term, regular ingestion of ayahuasca thatenhanced their health and vigor? We speculated about ways that we might approachthat question, and I even started drafting a grant application to NIDA after wereturned home. I quickly realized that, in Peru, we’d have trouble conducting astudy that involved asking for blood and urine samples; that wouldn’t beappropriate in light of cultural attitudes about witchcraft. And even if we gotthe samples, they’d be difficult to preserve. Beyond the logistical problemsloomed the simple fact that NIDA would never fund such a study. So we shelvedthe idea at the time.But it turned out that the organizers of the UDV conference had exactly thatkind of a project in mind. That was their real agenda; they wanted to enlist thehelp of recognized foreign scientists to carry out a biomedical study among UDVmembers that, they hoped, would support their petition to CONFEN to allow thesacramental use of the hoasca tea. In this case, the logistics were morerealistic. Many of the UDV members were themselves physicians, there was nocultural baggage involving witchcraft to contend with, and there were many UDVmembers who were eager to submit themselves to poking and prodding. So with theencouragement from top UDV mestres, I returned to the States and dusted off myold proposal. I revised and submitted it to them for their approval, which theygave. I started soliciting funds through Botanical Dimensions, and over thecourse of the next couple of years we were able to raise about $75,000 toconduct the study.But that lay ahead. Back at the conference, after three days of PowerPoints androundtables at a UDV temple on the outskirts of São Paulo, the event culminatedin an ayahuasca ceremony with the foreign dignitaries as the guests of honor.About 500 people took part in that ceremony. I had a profound visionaryrevelation, in which I experienced photosynthesis from a molecule’s eye view,and understood the importance of this everyday miracle for the sustenance oflife on the planet. It was a cathartic and moving experience, one of my mostprofound ayahuasca journeys. The following account of my “lesson from theTeacher” has been adapted from an earlier version that appeared in AyahuascaReader: Encounters with the Sacred Vine (Luna and White, 2000). On the night in question, the weather was humid and balmy. In the gatheringdusk, we all walked the short distance from the dormitories where we had beenstaying to the temple, nestled in a small valley about a quarter mile away. Inthe center of the amphitheatre-like space, a long table was arranged, withchairs arrayed around it and a picture of Mestre Gabriel, the UDV founder andprophet, hung beneath an arch-shaped structure decorated with the sun, moon, andstars at one end. Several gallons of hoasca tea, a brownish liquid the color ofcafé latte, was in a plastic juice dispenser placed on the table beneath thepicture of Mestre Gabriel; beside it was a stack of paper picnic cups.A special set of chairs had been reserved for the visiting dignitaries along oneof the terrace-like elevations close to the center of the amphitheater. Wethreaded our way among the members already seated and took our places in thereserved spot.After everyone had gotten settled, the mestre in charge rose to start dispensingthe brew, helped by a couple of acolytes. The members formed an orderly line,and one by one we filed down to stand before the mestre and be handed a papercup containing our allotted draft; the size of the servings varied from personto person, and seemed to be measured according to body weight and the mestre’sassessing gaze; one got the feeling that he was taking the measure of the souland spirit of the supplicant standing before him. Each person took their cup andreturned to stand in front of their chair. Once everyone had been served, themestre gave a signal and all raised the cups to their lips and drained thebitter, foul-tasting beverage in two or three gulps. One of the Brazilianscientists standing beside me slipped me a small piece of dried ginger to chewto kill the aftertaste; I was grateful for the kind gesture.Having drained their cups, everyone sat back in their comfortable webbed chairs.I kept hoping someone would turn off the glaring, buzzing, fluorescent lightsoverhead that were altogether too bright and quite annoying. They were to stayon during the entire evening, however. For about forty-five minutes, everyonesat, absorbed in their own thoughts. The crowded hall was absolutely silent.After this period, a few people began to get up and totter toward the bathroomsas the nausea, a frequent side effect in the early stages, began to take hold.About the same time, the mestre began singing a beautiful song, called ashamada, and though I could not understand the Portuguese words, the melody wasquite moving. The sound of the heartfelt shamada mingling with the wretching,gasping noises of people throwing up violently in the background made me smileat the incongruity, but no one else seemed to notice.My own experience was not developing as I’d hoped. My stomach was queasy but notenough to send me to the bathroom, and I felt restless and uncomfortable. I feltvery little effect, except for some brief flashes of hypnagogia behind my closedeyes. I was disappointed; I had been hoping for more than a sub-thresholdexperience. When the mestre signaled that he was ready to give a second glass toanyone who wanted it, I was among the group of about a dozen gringos that queuedup in front of the table; apparently I was not the only one who was having adifficult time connecting with the spirit of the tea.I took my second drink and settled back into my chair. It tasted, if possible,even worse than the first one had. Within a few minutes it became clear thatthis time, it was going to work. I began to feel the force of the hoasca coursethrough my body, a feeling of energy passing from the base of my spine to thetop of my head. It was like being borne upwards in a high-speed elevator. Iwelcomed the sensation as confirmation that the train was pulling out of thestation.The energized feeling and the sensation of rapid acceleration continued. It wasmuch like mushrooms but seemed to be much stronger; I had the sense that thiswas one elevator it would be hard to exit before reaching the top floor,wherever that might be. Random snippets of topics we had been discussing at theseminars in the previous days began to float into my consciousness. I rememberedone seminar that had addressed the UDV’s concept that the power of hoasca tea isa combination of “force” and “light.” The force was supplied by theMAO-inhibiting Banisteriopsis vine, known as mariri in the local vernacular,while the light—the visionary, hypnagogic component—was derived from chacruna,the DMT-containing Psychotria admixture plant. I thought to myself what an aptcharacterization this was; hoasca was definitely a combination of force andlight, and at that moment I was well within the grip of the force and hoped thatI was about to break out into the light.At the instant I had that thought, I heard a voice, seeming to come from behindmy left shoulder. It said something like, “You wanna see force? I’ll show youforce!” The question was clearly rhetorical, and I understood that I was aboutto experience something whether I wanted to or not. The next instant, I foundmyself changed into a disembodied point of view, suspended in space, thousandsof miles over the Amazon basin. I could see the curvature of the earth, thestars beyond shone steadily against an inky backdrop, and far below I could seeswirls and eddies of clouds over the basin, and the nerve-like tracery of vastriver systems. From the center of the basin arose the world tree, in the form ofan enormous Banisteriopsis vine. It was twisted into a helical form and itsflowering tops were just below my disembodied viewpoint, its base was anchoredto the earth far below, lost to vision in the depths of mist and clouds anddistance that stretched beneath me.As I gazed, awestruck, at this vision, the voice explained that the Amazon wasthe omphalos of the planet, and that the twisted, rope-like Yggdrasil-maririworld tree was the lynchpin that tied the three realms—the underworld, theearth, and the sky—together. Somehow I understood—though no words wereinvolved—that the Banisteriopsis vine was the embodiment of the plantintelligence that embraced and covered the earth, that together the community ofthe plant species that existed on the earth provided the nurturing energy thatmade life on earth possible. I “understood” that photosynthesis—that neat trick,known only to green plants, of making complex organic compounds from sunlight,carbon dioxide, and water, was the “force” the UDV was talking about, and indeedwas the force on which all life depends; I was reminded of a line from DylanThomas, that photosynthesis is “the force that through the green fuse drives theflower.”In the next moment, I found myself instantly transported from my bodiless perchin space to the lightless depths beneath the surface of the earth. I had somehowbecome a sentient water molecule, percolating randomly through the soil, lostamid the tangle of the enormous root fibers of the Banisteriopsis world tree. Icould feel the coolness, the dank dampness of the soil surrounding me, I feltsuspended in an enormous underground cistern, a single drop among billions ofdrops. This sensation lasted only a moment, then I felt a definite sense ofmovement as, squeezed by the implacable force of irresistible osmotic pressures,I was rapidly translocated into the roots of the Banisteriopsis tree; the senseof the rising, speeding elevator returned except this time I was being liftedrapidly through the vast pipes and tubes of the plant’s vascular system. I was asingle molecule of water tumbling through the myriad branches and forks of thevertical maze, which grew progressively narrower the higher I went.Finally, the sense of accelerating vertical movement eased off; I was nowfloating freely, in a horizontal direction; no longer feeling pushed, I wassuspended in the middle of a stream flowing through an enormous, vaulted tunnel.More than that, there was light at the end of the tunnel, a green light. With astart I realized that I had just passed through the petiole of a sun-drenchedleaf, and was being shunted into progressively narrowing arteries as I wascarried through the articulating veins toward some unknown destination. Ithelped that the voice—or my own narrative self, I’m not sure which—was providingoccasional commentary on the stages of the journey as it unfolded.Desperately I tried to remember my old lessons in plant physiology and anatomy.By this time I had been given the wordless understanding that I was about towitness, indeed, participate in, the central mystery of life on earth: a watermolecule’s view of the process of photosynthesis. Suddenly, I was no longersuspended in the arterial stream of the leaf vein; I had somehow beentransported into an enormous enclosed space, suffused with greenish light. Aboveme I could see the domed, vaulted roof of the structure I was inside of, and Iunderstood that I was inside a chloroplast; the roof was translucent and beamsof sunlight streamed through it like a bedroom window on a bright morning. Infront of me were flat, layered structures looking like folded sheets stackedclosely together, covered with antenna-shaped structures, all facing in the samedirection and all opened eagerly to receive the incoming light. I realized thatthese had to be the thylakoid membranes, the organelles within the chloroplastwhere the so-called “light reaction” takes place. The antenna-like structurescovering them literally glowed and hummed with photonic energy, and I could seethat somehow, this energy was being translocated through the membranes of thethylakoids they were mounted on. I recognized, or understood, that theseantenna-like arrays were molecules of chlorophyll, and the “anchors” that tiedthem to their membrane substrates were long tails of phytic acid that functionedas energy transducers, funneling the light energy collected by the flower-shapedreceptors through the membrane and into the layers beneath it.Next thing I knew, I was beneath that membrane; I was being carried along asthough borne on a conveyor belt; I could see the phytic acid chains danglingabove and beyond them, through the semitransparent “roof” of the membrane, theflower-like porphyrin groups that formed the chlorophyll’s light-gatheringapparatus loomed like the dishes of a radio telescope array. In the center ofthe space was what looked like a mottled flat surface, periodically being smitedby enormous bolts of energy that emanated, lightening-like, from the phytic acidtails suspended above it; and on that altar water molecules were being smashedto smithereens by the energy bolts. Consciousness exploded and died in a spasmof electron ecstasy as I was smited by the bolt of energy emitted by the phyticacid transducers and my poor water-molecule soul was split asunder.As the light energy was used to ionize the water, the oxygen liberated in theprocess rose with a shriek to escape from the chamber of horrors, while theelectrons, liberated from their matrix, were shunted into the electron-transportrollercoaster, sliding down the chain of cytochromes like a dancer being passedfrom partner to partner, into the waiting arms of “photosystem I,” only to beblasted again by yet another photonic charge, bounced into the close butfleeting embrace of ferredoxin, the primary electron acceptor, ultimatelycaptured by NADP+ to be used as bait to capture two elusive protons, as a flamedraws a moth. Suddenly I was outside the flattened thylakoid structures, whichfrom my perspective looked like high-rise, circular apartment buildings. Irecognized that I was suspended in the stroma, the region outside the thylakoidmembranes, where the mysterious “dark reaction” takes place, the alchemicalwedding that joins carbon dioxide to ribulose diphosphate, a shotgun marriagepresided over by ribulose diphosphate carboxylase, the first enzyme in theso-called pentose phosphate shunt. All was quiet and for a moment, I wasfloating free in darkness; then miraculously—miracles were by this timemundane—I realized that my disembodied point of view had been reincarnatedagain, and was now embedded in the matrix of the newly reduced ribulosediphosphate/carbon dioxide complex; this unstable intermediate was rapidlyfalling apart into two molecules of phosphoglycerate, which were grabbed andloaded on the merry-go-round by the first enzymes of the Calvin cycle. Dimly, Istruggled to remember my early botany lessons and put names to what I wasseeing.I recognized that I had entered the first phases of the pentose phosphate shunt,the biochemical pathway that builds the initial products of photosynthesis intocomplex sugars and sends them spinning from thence into the myriad pathways ofbiosynthesis that ultimately generate the molecular stuff of life.I felt humbled, shaken, exhausted, and exalted all at the same time. Suddenly, Iwas ripped out of my molecular rollercoaster ride, and my disembodied eye wasagain suspended high over the Amazon basin. This time, there was no world treearising from its center; it looked much like it must look from a spacecraft inorbit. The day was sunny, the vista stretching to the curved horizon was blueand green and bluish-green, the vegetation below, threaded with shining rivers,looked like green mold covering an overgrown petri plate. Suddenly I was wrackedwith a sense of overwhelming sadness, sadness mixed with fear for the delicatebalance of life on this planet, the fragile processes that drive and sustainlife, sadness for the fate of our planet and its precious cargo.“What will happen if we destroy the Amazon,” I thought to myself, “what willbecome of us, what will become of life itself, if we allow this destruction tocontinue? We cannot let this happen. It must be stopped, at any cost.” I wasweeping. I felt miserable, I felt anger and rage toward my own rapacious,destructive species, scarcely aware of its own devastating power, a species thatcares little about the swath of destruction it leaves in its wake as itthoughtlessly decimates ecosystems and burns thousands of acres of rainforest. Iwas filled with loathing and shame.Suddenly, again from behind my left shoulder, came a quiet voice. “You monkeysonly think you’re running things,” it said. “You don’t think we would reallyallow this to happen, do you?” And somehow, I knew that the “we” in thatstatement was the entire community of species that constitute the planetarybiosphere. I knew that I had been given an inestimable gift, a piece of gnosisand wisdom straight from the heart-mind of planetary intelligence, conveyed invisions and thought by an infinitely wise, incredibly ancient, and enormouslycompassionate “ambassador” to the human community. A sense of relief, temperedwith hope, washed over me. The vision faded, and I opened my eyes, to see mynewfound friends and hosts all eagerly gathered around me. The ceremony hadofficially ended a few minutes earlier; I had been utterly oblivious to whateverwas going on in the world beyond my closed eyelids. “How was it,” they wanted toknow, “did you feel the buhachara, the strange force?” I smiled to myself,feeling overjoyed at the prospect of sharing the experience and knowing that Ihad indeed been allowed to experience the ultimate “force,” the vastly alien,incredibly complex molecular machine that is “the force that through the greenfuse drives the flower.” "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 47 - New in Town I eventually became disillusioned with aspects of my job at ShamanPharmaceuticals, or perhaps my doubts were really about my potential for successas a corporate scientist. I’d grown to like my colleagues and enjoy the work,but I decided to look for other opportunities. Andrew Weil had contacted me tosuggest that I meet his friend Horst Rechelbacher, the founder of Aveda, aMinnesota-based cosmetics company that reflected his environmentally consciousviews. Aveda was committed to using sustainable, organic ingredients from aroundthe world, and Horst was looking for an ethnobotanist to help the companydevelop products from botanical ingredients. The word was that impending changesin regulatory policy would look favorably on herbal medicines, and the industrywould explode as a result. Aveda was weighing whether to enter the market fornutraceuticals and dietary supplements and would need help in that area if theydid.Thanks to Weil, I got a chance to chat with Rechelbacher at a Seeds of Changeconference in Santa Fe in the fall of 1992. (The event has since been renamedthe Bioneers Conference and is held each year in San Rafael.) Our meeting wentwell. I knew the Austrian-born Horst by reputation as a visionary and anentrepreneurial genius. A self-made multimillionaire who had worked in the salontrade since his early teens, he’d built the Aveda Corporation from scratch. Iwasn’t sure what I could do for him, I said; after all, I was a CNSpharmacologist and ethnobotanist. I did view myself a natural products chemistto some extent, but what did I know about cosmetics or cosmetic formulations?Horst assured me that didn’t matter. In effect, what he said was, if I came towork for him he’d pay me twice as much as I’d been making at Shaman, and I coulddo whatever I wanted. An offer like that was hard to pass up.He invited me to visit their headquarters outside Minneapolis, and shortly afterthe conference I flew out to meet with him and some of his executives. I stayedat the Aveda Spa in the St. Croix Valley nearby his palatial home in Osceola,Wisconsin, and they treated me like royalty. Even though it was November andwell into a gray autumn, the St. Croix Valley was beautiful, and the ruralsetting appealed to me. A move there would be a welcome escape from the urbandensity of the Bay Area. There was no way we could ever afford a house inCalifornia, but in Minnesota we just might pull it off. We were also drawn tothe prospect of finding a nice school for Caitlin. All things considered, itmade sense to pick up stakes and move. I returned to Menlo Park and gave noticeat Shaman.We left Menlo Park on New Year’s Eve 1992, angling the Honda south to avoid ablizzard that had blocked the passes along I-80 on the route through Tahoe.After a stop to visit Aunt Mayme in Paonia, we ran east over the plains, tryingto outrace another storm that had swept in over the coast behind us. The snowsfinally caught up to us in Iowa, forcing us into a Holiday Inn outside DesMoines. When we finally reached Minneapolis and stepped out of the car, it wasinto near-zero temps and an icy, biting wind. As lightly clad Californiarefugees in an unlikely promised land, we suddenly had our doubts about whatwe’d gotten into.Day by day, however, we settled in. One lesson I’d learned at Shaman the hardway was that a verbal agreement wasn’t worth much in the corporate world, atleast when it came to a starting salary. Horst, however, was as good as hisword. I had a new position at more than twice what I’d been making, with animpressive title: Senior Research Pharmacognosist. I was delighted, of course,and launched into my new work with great hopes.Horst was open to finding and incorporating natural ingredients from all overthe globe and, if possible, sourcing them from indigenous communities. The newregulations wouldn’t become law for more than a year—the Dietary SupplementHealth and Education Act of 1994, or DSHEA—but there were already plans afoot toposition the company for the impending herbal gold rush. If predictions held,the new law would open new markets for natural medicines and create lots ofopportunities for “pharmacognosists” like me. The term is derived from the Greekpharmakon, for drugs, and gnôsis, knowledge; it refers to a specialist in thescientific study of drugs of natural origin. Despite my title, I wasn’t formallya pharmacognosist, but I was charged with taking the lead on product innovationin that arena.We had a good meeting about the new mission shortly after I started my job.Weil, who had done so much to help me, was there, and we talked about the newdirection we were charting. Shortly after that, Horst took off to India for sixmonths and left me to the tender ministrations of the director of R&D and thechief financial officer. I began making plans for a trip to Brazil in thespring. Aveda already had a part-time field consultant in Manaus, a city in theheart of the Amazon, and had considered setting up a lab there. I wanted toconnect with her and begin collecting around Manaus, looking for plants thatcould potentially be used as cosmetic ingredients, dietary supplements, or evenfood sources.As I settled into my new job, Sheila started scanning the papers, searching fora house. We considered some neighborhoods in the Twin Cities but we reallywanted to live somewhere along the St. Croix River. Over the course of ourSunday drives, we became utterly charmed by Marine on St. Croix, a quiet hamletof 604 souls about ten miles north of Stillwater. We decided our new home had tobe there. There wasn’t much on the market, but finally, we made an offer on avery small house in Marine, a classic case of the ugliest house on the beststreet in town. Twenty years later, we’re still here. After a modest renovationand expansion it has been the perfect home for us ever since.Marine proved to be the ideal community it appeared to be. It has all the goodthings that small towns can offer, and, yes, some of the warts and blemishes aswell. Garrison Keillor’s Lake Wobegon, his mythical Minnesota town, is oftenregarded as being loosely based on Marine. Keillor lived in Marine a few yearsbefore we arrived, and many of the skits and vignettes on his radio show, APrairie Home Companion, were apparently inspired by the local array of eccentriccharacters and places. Ralph’s Pretty Good Grocery, the Chatterbox Café, and theSidetrack Tap certainly seem like parodies of local businesses well known to anyMarine resident.Our choice to settle in Marine was fortuitous. It had a tiny elementary school,only about 170 students in total, recognized as one of the best K-6 schools inthe state. All the children really were above average! We quickly made friends;there was another California refugee family from San Jose, a software developerand his wife who had arrived the year before with their two daughters, one ofwhom was Cait’s age. We met others in the community the same way, and we soonwere part of a close-knit circle of friends based around our kids, not tomention similar liberal political persuasions. The kids are all grown now, butour little circle remains close. One could not wish for a finer bunch of friendsand neighbors.That first year in Marine was a rewarding time for me, at home, at work, and inthe wider scientific circles whose respect I valued. I met good people at Avedaand enjoyed my modest prosperity. As I prepared for my trip to Brazil, I alsofollowed up on a plan that emerged from the União do Vegetal conference in SãoPaulo in 1991. After that conference, I had drafted a proposal to carry out abiomedical investigation of ayahuasca that had since been approved by the UDV’smedical committee. We had also raised enough funds through Botanical Dimensionsto carry out the study. I’d be in Brazil for almost eight weeks, most of them inManaus, so we made plans to conduct the field phase of our study there in June.Our work took place over about five weeks at one of the oldest UDV temples inManaus, Nucleo Caupari.The Hoasca Study, as it came to be known, turned out to be a milestone event inthe scientific investigation of the long-term use of ayahuasca. My colleaguesand friends fulfilled important roles: Charles Grob, M.D., now a professor ofpsychiatry and pediatrics at UCLA, was the principle investigator, and JaceCallaway, an American biochemist at the University of Kuopio in Finland, carriedout most of the analytical and pharmacokinetic work. Many others alsocontributed. One key figure who went unacknowledged in the published findingswas our friend Annelise Schinzinger, a longtime UDV member who worked closelywith us as a Portuguese translator. The project could not have been accomplishedwithout her help, and her recognition is long past due. Our study triggered asmall surge in ayahuasca research, resulting in at least six peer-reviewedpapers, several review papers, and major advances in our understanding ofAyahuasca pharmacology. There were only fourteen citations on Ayahuasca inPubmed between 1960 and 1994; since then, there have been eighty-twopublications.In 1993, I also helped establish the Heffter Research Institute, a nonprofitorganization committed to investigating “the appropriate and safe use ofclassical hallucinogens in a medical context.” The institute was the brainchildof David Nichols, the Purdue professor of pharmacology and medicinal chemistry Imentioned earlier, a world expert on the study of psychedelic compounds. Theinstitute was named after Arthur Heffter, an obscure but admired figure in thehistory of psychedelic research. A German chemist, pharmacologist, andRenaissance man, Heffter was the first to systematically investigate thealkaloids of peyote cactus and demonstrate, in careful self-experiments, thatmescaline was the major hallucinogenic compound in the plant. Beloved andadmired by his students, Heffter didn’t fit the usual stereotype of thenineteenth-century German “Herr Professor.” We chose the name because heexemplified both the spirit of bold scientific exploration and the high ethicalstandards we wanted our institute to represent.In addition to Nichols, Grob, and myself, the original Heffter board includedMark Geyer, a psychopharmacologist from the University of California, San Diego;George Greer, M.D., a psychiatrist and MDMA researcher from Santa Fe; and PhilipWolfson, M.D., a Bay Area psychotherapist. Our first meeting took place at theMount Baldy Zen Center in the Angeles National Forest east of L.A., a rusticspot perfect for planning and “envisioning.” While the board has changed overthe years, it continues to include many leading researchers in the field, andthe Heffter remains the premier sponsor of basic and clinical research onpsychedelics (www.heffter.org [http://www.heffter.org/]). I’ve always been proudto be affiliated with the institute, though I’ve sometimes felt a bit out ofplace, lacking a high-level research position, lab, or other such resource. Butsomeone had to represent the interests of ethnopharmacology, and I was fortunateto have that role fall to me. [images/00035.jpg]> José Cabral and Dennis preparing voucher specimens, UDV study, 1993. After my trip to Brazil, I continued my efforts to expand my employer’s presencethere, as part of the company strategy we’d drawn up when I started the job.Indeed, I spent much of my time writing and presenting budgets and work plans tothe “steering committee,” a group that ran the operation in the absence of thevisionary who had created it. I was learning the ropes of corporate life, or soI thought. It took almost the entire year to get the OK on my budgets, but theresults looked good. The committee approved nearly $600,000 to set up a lab inManaus and start collecting and evaluating plants for possible use in cosmeticsand medicine or as food sources. There was even a line item to buy a small boatfor expeditions up the more remote tributaries. I’d come a long way from my dayswith the Heraclitistas on the River of Poisons.Or had I? I soon discovered there was something just as problematic aboutsteering by committee north of the equator. I figured that getting the go-aheadwas a mere formality. Instead, at a meeting early in 1994, I was informed thatgetting a budget approved didn’t mean I could actually spend it. Which surprisedme. It turned out there was a reality parallel to the one I’d been living in,and that’s where the spending decisions were actually made. To put it simply,there would be no new lab in the Amazon, no botanical explorations, and no boat.I’d be at Aveda another year and a half, but from that moment on I realized I’dnever accomplish the goals we’d defined at the outset. The clues were therebefore, of course, even if I’d chosen not to articulate them. There was adifference between Horst’s vision, which was environmentally oriented andforward-looking, and what really went on from day to day. He wanted to save theplanet; the middle managers running the place basically viewed their mission asgetting shampoo out the door. Anything that didn’t directly support that rathermundane goal became an impediment.I finally gave notice in 1995. Most people who left Aveda didn’t do so bychoice; perhaps because I did, Horst and I parted amicably and remained friends.I respect him very much, and I’d like to believe the feeling is mutual. After hesold his company to Estée Lauder in 1997 for a reported $300 million, I thinkit’s fair to say he became more relaxed and playful. And who wouldn’t? Havingthat kind of money in your account will do wonders for stress, especially ifhaving the money means you’re able to spend it. By then, the herbal boom triggered by DSHEA had fully begun. After leavingAveda, I took a job as the R&D director for Nutraceutix, a company based inRedmond, a position that let me work from home for three weeks each month andspend a week at its plant in Washington. The company made probiotic supplementsfor livestock feed but wanted to capitalize on the burgeoning demand for dietarysupplements for humans. After developing some formulations for Odwalla, theorganic juice company in Santa Cruz, California, we started a project to growginseng using “hairy root” propagation, a cool technology for generating largeamounts of root biomass in vats without actually growing entire plants. Intheory, that made the hairy-root technique an efficient method for producinghigh-value metabolites that are hard to synthesize. Our goal was to produce“super ginseng” with enhanced levels of active metabolites. I reconnected withmy mentor Neil Towers and the lab at UBC to help us carry out a pilot study. Wediscovered the high-tech methods cost too much compared to just growing ginsengthe old-fashioned way, and the project was dropped. I left the company in 1998when it decided the real money lay in sports supplements. Since those were madeup almost entirely of synthetic ingredients, there wasn’t much reason for aplant guy to stick around.I made a good living for the next couple of years as an independent consultant.More important than the money, I learned, was having control over my time.Business was good. Kava kava, the Polynesian anxiolytic beverage, was becomingquite popular, and there was keen interest in creating drinks that incorporateda dose of kava for relaxation and as a social lubricant. Many Hawaii farmers sawkava as the next big cash crop, reviving a local economy that had been sluggishsince the sugarcane market collapsed decades earlier. I consulted for a companythat was starting work on what is known as a supercritical extraction plant onthe Big Island for kava and other organic biomaterials. Meanwhile, anotherclient had ties to a large ranch on the island of Molokai that had beguncommitting many acres to kava cultivation. That led to a modest grant throughthe Heffter Research Institute to characterize the “chemotypes” of therecognized varieties of Hawaiian kava, or “awa” as it is called there. The studywas somewhat outside the Heffter’s mission scope, but we undertook it, giventhat the research concerned the ethnobotany of a culturally importantpsychoactive plant. The result, published in 1999, was the first detailedinvestigation of the chemistry and morphological diversity of “awa” in Hawaii(Lebot et al., 1999).Back on the mainland, I worked with a startup company, Pharmanex, whose founderswere developing a line of high-quality supplements to be sold throughpharmacies. My job was to produce scientific write-ups on each product as partof an effort to educate pharmacists about herbal supplements, a big project Ifinished with the help of two colleagues, medical writer Kenneth Jones andethnobotanist Kerry Hughes. Pharmanex published the work as a desktop reference,but by then the firm had been acquired by Nu Skin Enterprises, a larger companywhose direct-sales strategy had no role for pharmacists, much less a book toinform them. Our orphaned text eventually caught the attention of Haworth HerbalPress, which published an updated edition as Botanical Medicines: The DeskReference for Major Herbal Supplements in 2002. I went on to serve as editor inchief of Haworth Herbal Press until the imprint was discontinued after the saleof its parent, Haworth Press, to Taylor and Francis in 2007.So that’s a sketch of my career through the 1990s. Looking back, I’d say myexperiences at Aveda, and earlier at Shaman, were quite valuable and havecolored my perspective ever since. I realized I didn’t work well in a corporatestructure, subject to someone else’s idea of how best to use my time. I didbetter work as a consultant, and most of my subsequent forays into the corporateworld would be in that capacity. Since 2001, I’ve served as an adjunct assistantprofessor at the Center for Spirituality and Healing at the University ofMinnesota in Minneapolis. In recent years, I’ve also taught summer field coursesfor pharmacy students in Ecuador and Peru. I’ve mentioned how lucky I was toencounter talented mentors and teachers whose love of plants was a gift theywere driven to share with their students. I’m grateful now for the chance I haveto impart my love of the natural world in turn. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 48 - The Bard in Light and Shadow [images/00016.jpg]> Terence (Photo by J. Wagner) It’s been more than thirty years since that rainy Monday in April 1981 whenTerence packed up seeds and gear and said goodbye to me at the airport inIquitos. While our farewells were temporary, my sadness at the time saidotherwise. On some level, I knew the occasion marked a pivotal transition forus, and I think he felt the same. Over the decades ahead, we’d be caught up inthe same relentless flow of time that carries every being toward its separatefate. There would always be something akin to quantum entanglement between us,at least binding our minds. Though we saw each other frequently and remained inclose touch over the ensuing decades, the vicissitudes of life largely kept usfocused on our own separate tracks.While I’d been finishing my thesis in Vancouver and working through variouspostdocs, building a scientific career and raising a daughter in a new hometown,Terence had been striking off in new directions of his own. He had abandonedplans for an academic career and, publicly at least, had rejected science or anyother sort of conventional professional identity. Always a maverick, he eschewedanything like a “real job.” Fortunately, he was clever and talented enough notto need one. Like Marshall McLuhan, another contemporary maverick that we bothadmired, Terence was able to carve out a unique place at the table in theongoing cultural conversation.During the eighties, interest grew in the philosophical ideas and peculiarnotions that Terence espoused. The books we had coauthored, The InvisibleLandscape and Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower’s Guide, were important earlytexts in that regard. The former exposed readers to a mind-stretching plethoraof odd but appealing ideas, and the latter gave them a do-it-yourself method forvisiting the realms we postulated if they wanted to try it at home.Over time, Terence used his talents as a charismatic lecturer and raconteur todevelop a devoted following. He became closely identified with mushrooms and thepeculiar ideas associated with them, and discussed them openly in hisever-more-frequent radio interviews and public appearances. Even thoughmushrooms themselves were illegal, there was no law against talking about them,and Terence’s open advocacy of the psychedelic experience was reminiscent ofLeary’s, another Irish gadfly who, in his prime, had used psychedelics to poke astick in the eye of an uptight establishment. During the Reagan era and theJust-Say-No phase of the War on Drugs, Terence’s message got under the skin ofmany of the more humorless arbiters of morality and cultural correctness. Healways had a gift for the provocative statement, and for him to put himself outthere as the chief advocate of psychedelic gnosis when no one else was doing sotook some courage.Psychedelics are not suppressed because they are dangerous to users; they’resuppressed because they provoke unconventional thought, which threatens anynumber of elites and institutions that would rather do our thinking for us.Historically, those in power have always sought to suppress free thought,whether bluntly or subtly, because it poses an inherent challenge to their rule.That’s no less true today, in an age when corporate, political, and religiousinterests form a global bloc whose interests threaten all earthly life,including human life. Mushrooms have a way of inoculating the mind against thekind of thought control the prevailing order in any age needs to sustain itself.I’m not naively suggesting that the work of building a better world stops withthe psychedelic experience. But it could be where it begins, or is renewed—inthe moment of freedom when one glimpses the transient nature of reality and itsever-present potential for change.Terence, by example, gave people permission to explore consciousness, to think,and to entertain new ideas. He reminded his listeners that it’s fun to exercisethe imagination; astonishment and wonder awaken our desires to look inwardly atwho we are and outwardly at the marvelous universe we inhabit. No matter howmuch we come to understand, there will always be infinitely more to beunderstood. One of Terence’s favorite quotes was from the English geneticistJ.B.S. Haldane: “My own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer thanwe suppose, but queerer than we can suppose.” Terence reveled in that insight.The fact is that “funny ideas,” no matter how strange, play a crucial role inenticing us beyond the perimeters of the imaginable. As a leading,late-twentieth-century advocate of funny ideas, Terence deserves credit forleaving the scope of what we can suppose just a bit wider than he found it.One challenge for him was finding a way to turn his gift of gab into tangibleproducts that would help him pay the bills. He began working with others tocapture and market his raps on tape. One early example was the original versionof True Hallucinations, an audio-book account of our trip to La Chorerra that heread aloud, released by a company called Sound Photosynthesis in 1984. That andother early recordings helped him garner renown and some royalties, which SoundPhotosynthesis, for one, eventually stopped paying. Terence’s talks and lecturesare now widely available for free on the Internet, which is great in one senseand heartbreaking in another. Unlike the ephemeral “works” of other legendaryconversationalists, Terence’s talks will live on as long as people care tolisten. On the other hand, once such creations are available to all in digitalform, they cease to belong to their creators or their families, making it thatmuch harder for an unaffiliated free thinker like Terence to achieve the kind ofstability needed to make ends meet, let alone to step back and assess one’swork, or push it in new directions.By 1990, Terence had fully assumed his role as the bardic, shaman-tricksterfigure that became his beloved (and occasionally ridiculed) public persona. Inaddition to his role as spokesman for the new psychedelic culture, he’d achievedsome notoriety for his timewave theory and its predicted end of history. He hadfound his “shtick,” as he sometimes lightly called it, and that kept him on thepublic stage before a growing legion of fans. There was no real competition forhis niche; Leary was still around, but by then he was old and boring. If theoriginal sixties psychedelic message was about peace, free love, Eastern wisdom,and getting back to nature, Terence’s take, while deeply informed by all that,had is own distinct edge. His audiences were mostly younger inhabitants of theGlobal Village foreseen by McLuhan, and by the early nineties becoming areality. They were far from Luddite back-to-the-landers; these wereworld-spanning techno-nomads of an emerging global tribalism, the enthusiasticvanguard of a new post-historical archaic revival. Two decades ago, thehyper-connected informational environment and global neural network that most ofus inhabit today was still nascent. Terence was the perfect avatar to give voiceand vision to that emerging shift. Cool, articulate, eclectically educated,funny, steeped in psychedelics and sci-fi, Terence channeled the logos of theage. Silver-tongued and a riveting speaker, he articulated the concepts that hisfans groped for but could not express, and he did so in a witty, disarming way.He was the gnomic trickster and bard, an elfin comedian delivering the cosmicpunch line, even as he assured us we were all in on the joke. You just had tolove him, and many people did, and still do.Another important step for Terence was his association with the Esalen Institutein Big Sur. In the late eighties into the early nineties, he spent time as a“scholar in residence” at Esalen during the summers. During those years, he alsobegan to attract notice from publishers. The Archaic Revival: Speculations onPsychedelic Mushrooms, the Amazon, Virtual Reality, UFOs, Evolution, Shamanism,the Rebirth of the Goddess, and the End of History appeared in 1992. Terence wasnever one for the short, catchy title. Food of the Gods: The Search for theOriginal Tree of Knowledge and a Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and HumanEvolution was also published in 1992, as was Trialogues at the Edge of the West:Chaos, Creativity and the Resacralization of the West, the first of threepublished conversations with the mathematician Ralph Abraham and the theoreticalbiologist Rupert Sheldrake. True Hallucinations first appeared in book form in1993; of all Terence’s writings during this prolific period, that work standsout for me as his most accessible and personal. Most of our contemporaries neverembarked on such an adventure, but many could understand why we did; Terence’saccount of it is a quest narrative at heart, imbued with the dreams andillusions of our time and of youth in general. The story’s broad appeal and hisskillful telling of it resulted in what is arguably a classic of the era’sliterature.I always thought Terence was at his best when he spoke on topics that were notdirectly related to the timewave or psychedelics. He was extremely well read ona variety of interesting and obscure topics, partly because of his experience inthe Tussman program at Berkeley, but mostly through the books he lovinglyaccumulated over years of creating his amazing library, which eventuallynumbered more than 3,000 volumes. He told me he’d read most of them, and Ibelieve him. He was an astute observer of contemporary culture, and oftenprescient about many of the social, historical, and technological forces thathave created our post-millennial world. That may explain why so many ofTerence’s lectures survive on the Internet, and why people are still listeningto them. Even though they date back to the eighties and nineties, they sound asfresh and timely as if they were uttered yesterday. As I’ve noted, Terence’sgenius was that he could see the future that was immanent in current events, andthen articulate that insight for the rest of us. He may have gotten the detailswrong in places, and been hobbled by the assumptions of the metaphysics heconstructed, but one only has to look around to realize that, basically, he gotit remarkably right. If Terence returned tomorrow, he would be unsurprised bymost of what has transpired since his death. He would, no doubt, have incisivethoughts to share about the world at present, and the future impending withinit, invisible to all but the few with his gift of perceiving it.Terence put his ideas out there, but he was never wedded to them, or inclined topresent them as scripture. He was anti-dogmatic by nature. He always maintaineda sense of humor and a bemused perspective about his theories, and that was partof his appeal. He insisted that people should think for themselves and maketheir own judgments about his “crazy” notions. His ability to keep those notionsat arm’s length, so to speak, was an affirmation of his inherent stability. Hewas able to say, “Hey, here’s a whole set of really wild ideas that are fun tothink about; maybe some are even true. What do you think?”It was an irreverent stance for a guru, which he never wanted to be. He had nodesire to tell people what they should think; he just wanted them to think,period. I believe he viewed himself as a teacher, perhaps in some respects anentertainer, but never a guru. Many younger people have told me that whatthey’ve learned from Terence was more relevant to them than any other part oftheir educations, which is an enormous compliment to him and his talents.And yet for every charismatic figure there is a legion of people who are eagerto follow, and a certain contingent of Terence’s audience viewed him in thatway. He liked being recognized and admired, of course, but he never took himselfthat seriously, and had no desire to lead a flock. Most of the world’s religionsare empowered by the human readiness to worship charismatic figures and seeksolace in mass identification. Religious and political demagogues use theseimpulses to lure believers into relinquishing self-responsibility and thecapacity for critical thought. Sociopathic or psychopathic personalities whoachieve fame are usually quite happy to exploit their status, unburdened as theyare by conscience, self-insight, or doubt.Terence wanted no part of that sick dynamic. He was keenly aware of thedifference between how some chose to see him and who he really was. One of histhoroughly sane admirers told me a story that revealed Terence’s healthyperspective on his celebrity. The moment occurred at an appearance he made withthe spiritual leader Ram Dass, who has had his own issues with guru-worship andcult followers. It happened during the nineties, at a time when Terence wasdealing with his share of personal setbacks. In their dialog, Ram Dass said,“Your life is your message,” a typical guru-esque pronouncement; Terencereplied, “My life is a mess. My message is my message.” So that was Terence, as I saw him, at the zenith of his creative powers andcareer. I dare say those years, especially later on, were not his happiest. Bythe time my family and I moved from Bethesda back to the Bay Area in 1988,Terence’s marriage was already under strain. By the time we left for Minnesotain late 1992, he and Kat had decided to get a divorce. The end of their marriagewould affect my ties to both of them in profound and lasting ways. Terencevisited us in Minnesota in late 1993, and we thoroughly enjoyed his company.With my new job and comfortable home life, it was a good time for me. After hisrecent publishing successes, Terence had much to be proud of as well. I may havethought we were adjusting to the fact of his pending divorce, which would befinalized in the year ahead, but I was underestimating its impact on both of us.Though he sometimes railed against monogamy in his lectures, Terence wasbasically a serial monogamist at heart. Multiple partners and free love didn’twork for him. He may have had a few short affairs in the period of emotionalturbulence after his separation, but what he was looking for was someone toshare the next phase of his life. Eventually he found her, or so he felt.Terence met Jill at a conference near Palenque, the famous Maya ruins insouthern Mexico. Known as the Entheobotany Seminars, the event, hosted annuallyby the Botanical Preservation Corps, had become the place to see and be seen byeverybody who was anybody in the psychedelic world. Terence had actually metJill’s mother, a Jungian psychologist, years earlier when she invited him togive a workshop she was organizing in Los Angeles. Jill had been busy raisingher own young daughter at the time and had not attended. Terence and Jill datedfor several months and then moved in together on the Big Island in mid-1994.They parted in late 1997.In retrospect, I realize that by 1994 Terence was dealing with one of the mostdifficult periods in his life. His separation and eventual divorce had left himdepressed. He was regularly suffering migraines, a malady that had plagued himoff and on since adolescence. He was also feeling the pressures of maintaining apublic persona, the constant travel it required, and the effort it took to meetthe expectations of his audience. Jill was one of the few people he could turnto for emotional support, and their relationship became a refuge from thedemands of his work.My sense is that Terence had a growing ambivalence about his career. One eventthat may have contributed to that feeling occurred at the Palenque seminars inearly 1996. Prior to the conference, Terence had been corresponding with a youngmathematician named Matthew Watkins, who wanted to discuss what he believed tobe flaws in the calculations underlying the timewave. The two agreed to meet inPalenque and talk it out.Watkins later said he didn’t set out to “debunk” the timewave. In fact, over theconference, the two men had several friendly conversations about what Terencelater dubbed “the Watkins Objection.” During their chats, Watkins more or lessdeconstructed the timewave theory, to the point where Terence conceded that hischallenger had identified some critical flaws. The sessions amounted to acordial but serious exchange between two serious thinkers discussing the meritsof a fairly arcane and abstract set of concepts.Nevertheless, I believe the encounter deeply affected Terence. Watkins’scritique was perhaps the first time anyone with mathematical expertise hadquestioned the tenets of his theory; as such, it carried more weight thanprevious criticisms, including my own. To make things worse, Terence had beensuffering such severe migraines that he was barely able to leave his room muchof the time. Once back home in Hawaii, he posted a response to Watkins on hiswebsite Hyperborea (www.levity.com/eschaton/hyperborea.html[http://www.levity.com/eschaton/hyperborea.html]) but took it down when Watkinsdeclared it unsatisfactory. He then allowed Watkins to furnish his own response,which Terence linked to under a title he’d given it: “Autopsy for a MathematicalHallucination?” The statement remains posted to this day(www.fourmilab.ch/rpkp/autopsy.html[http://www.fourmilab.ch/rpkp/autopsy.html]).There was a brief flurry of revisionism by certain timewave supporters, whichaccording to Watkins, in a 2010 recap, failed to produce a better version. Muchof this history is recounted from a different perspective on Peter Meyer’swebsite (www.fractal-timewave.com [http://www.fractal-timewave.com/]). Meyer isthe computer programmer who worked with Terence during the mid-eighties todevelop the Timewave Zero software program that he still sells on CD-ROM. Backin 1996, the Watkins Objection remained front and center for a while on theNovelty List, an email forum devoted to timewave-related topics, devolving atcertain moments into objections aimed at Watkins himself. While eventually thecontributors moved on, the impact lingered for Terence. I believe the affairshook his confidence in the validity of the timewave, a project that constituteda major part of his life’s work.At the time, I was living in Minnesota, tending to my own career and family. Itwas a difficult period in my relationship with Terence. Whether my perceptionswere accurate or not, I wasn’t happy with the way he’d been dealing with thefallout from his divorce. I also challenged him for not “walking his talk.” Hewas active on the lecture circuit promoting psychedelics but taking them onlyrarely, just at a point when I thought he should have been taking them tofacilitate insight and self-reflection. He disagreed and resented my efforts toengage him on it. For me, the emotions tied to these events stirred up a lot ofturmoil and memories dating back to our earliest childhood. We didn’t overtlyargue, but tensions between us were definitely high.Looking back on that period from a distance of fifteen years or so, I can seenow that I failed to appreciate how depressed Terence was at the time, and howbadly he felt about the failure of his marriage and the challenges of hiscareer. I should have had more compassion for him. I am chagrined and a littleashamed to admit that I was not there for Terence at a moment when a brothershould have been. Terence was fifty when our Father died in 1997, and I was forty-six. Dad hadlong since retired to Mesa, Arizona, and lived there with Lois, his second wife.The rheumatic fever he’d had as a child had caused a heart valve defect thatdeteriorated over time. “Leaky valves” in old age are a common long-term outcomeof this childhood disease, and the accepted treatment is a pig valve transplant.Our father had this procedure in the early eighties, and it fixed the problemfor more than a decade. He wasn’t climbing mountains or hang-gliding, but heplayed golf and swam regularly and had few problems until the mid-1990s.After that, the valve became less efficient, but a second transplant wasn’tindicated because of his age; what awaited him was advancing congestive heartfailure. During this period we happened to be on a family vacation in Coloradoat the same time Dad and Lois were. We were all staying at the Redstone Inn onthe Crystal River, our old childhood family haunt. Dad became so short of breathsitting in the dining room I thought he was going to faint. He could barely makeit upstairs to his room and appeared on the verge of a heart attack.Fortunately, the episode passed (it was probably triggered by high altitude) buthe was definitely on the decline. He made a remark that day that has stuck withme: “You’re just living your life and everything is going along fine,” he said,“and the next thing you know, you look in the mirror and you see an old manlooking back at you. You suddenly realize that you’re old. How did that happen?”He seemed genuinely puzzled. By then he could do little but sit in a chair. Hewas very uncomfortable and usually short of breath. It was wrenching to see thisold man, my old man, suffering so much. It almost seemed as if death would bemerciful even though he was “only” eighty at the time.His doctors came up with the brilliant idea of implanting a defibrillator in hischest. Neither Terence nor I were consulted or even informed about this untilthe deed had been done. When I found out, I was furious. Dad did not havearrhythmia or irregular heartbeat; he had congestive heart failure. Though somewould argue the devices reduce the risk of “sudden death,” a defibrillatorstruck me as an inappropriate treatment for a man of his age and condition. Forme, convincing him to undergo the procedure amounted to malpractice. ButMedicare would pay for it and reward his physicians well for doing so—anotherregrettable illustration of high-tech medicine out of control.We had no idea just how regrettable until our father’s death—or rather, his manydeaths. His ordeal began on April 27, 1997, a day when I had flown to Boston fora meeting with a company I was consulting for. Terence, as it happened, was alsoon the East Coast, giving a workshop in North Carolina. There was a message fromSheila awaiting me when I checked into the hotel. Lois had called to tell her myfather had fallen in the shower after suffering an apparent heart attack orstroke. He’d been taken, unconscious, to the emergency room and died shortlythereafter. I went to my room and called Lois. After talking to her a fewminutes, I hung up and sat there gathering my thoughts. The news wasn’t asurprise; we’d been expecting something like it for some time.Then Lois called back with an odd and disturbing follow-up: it seemed that Dadhad not died after all. He had not recovered consciousness, but his heart hadstarted beating again due to the defibrillator, which kept kicking in when hisheart stopped. The thing would literally resurrect him every time. Lois gave methe number at the hospital, and I called and talked to a nurse, explained thesituation to him, and asked if they could just turn off the defibrillator.Clearly, Dad was not going to recover and yet was being denied a peaceful death.The nurse’s answer shocked me. Actually, no, he said, they could not turn offthe device, because it belonged to the corporation, and only a companytechnician could access the software codes that deactivated it. The request todo so had to be authorized by my father’s physician.“Well, get the goddamn physician on the line and have him authorize it!” Idemanded, by now screaming into the phone. But the physician was on a golfjunket in Florida and couldn’t be reached, and no one was aware of a Plan B. Thenurse, who shared my distress, said the only way to resolve the matter was forme to get there as soon as I could and get in someone’s face.I hung up and called Terence at the conference center, and we both startedmaking plans to get to Mesa. I left around ten p.m. and finally made it toPhoenix three stops and twelve hours later. Terence had been going through thesame nightmare and reached the hospital an hour before me. Overnight, the staffhad finally had gotten someone to turn off the device, but Dad had lingered onuntil Terence arrived and then stopped breathing twenty minutes later. I arrivedshortly after that, but by then Terence, having no idea when I’d get there, hadleft, hoping to catch his connection for Hawaii out of L.A.Being in the presence of someone who has just expired is a strange experience.The room was still crackling with the energy of our father’s departing spirit; Ihad a definite, eerie sense that it was still hanging around, as if reluctant toleave until I showed up. The sight of him was enough to tell me his death hadnot been peaceful; the device in his chest would not permit that. The signatureof his suffering, his agony and exhaustion, was etched into his face, and I willnever forget it.Both of our parent’s deaths were fraught with drama. Our mother’s had beendisrupted by our concern over Terence, at the time a fugitive, trying to sneakinto the country to spend some final moments with her. That did not happen, andMom died never getting the chance to forgive or speak with her eldest andfavorite son. At least Dad got to see Terence before he died, though I don’tknow if Dad was conscious when Terence was with him. I felt like the one wholost out; Dad had expired by the time I got there. Over the years, reflecting onthese events, I’ve often berated myself for not taking legal action against thephysicians who implanted the device. The death of a loved one is often a momentof great vulnerability. Lawyers and lawsuits are the last things a survivorwants to think about, and I didn’t, though I feel now I should have. It wouldn’tbe the last time that a paralysis born of grief would cloud my judgment and keepme from making the right decision. I had no idea how to go about filing a suit,and I had doubts about whether we’d have the resources to sustain such a longand costly action if we did file. Life was pressing in, and I made the decisionto move on.I’ve often regretted it. Dad was a good and ethical man. He was a good husbandto our mother, and a good father to Terry and me despite the grief we causedhim. He fought bravely in the war and paid a price for it. He enjoyed hisfriends, his fishing and hunting, his golf, his flying. He was an admirableperson in many ways, someone to look up to and emulate. He was certainly not “anaverage guy” even though that’s how he wanted to think of himself. He was agood, practicing, believing Catholic to the very end. I hope he went to thatheaven, if that’s the one he wanted, because he deserved to. In January 1998, I took part in a twelve-day Ayahuasca workshop in Iquitos,Peru, at Francisco Montes’s retreat, Jardín Etnobotánico Sachamama, an houroutside Iquitos. Luis Eduardo Luna showed up, as did Francisco’s cousin, thepainter Pablo Amaringo. The workshop had been touted as a splendid retreat in abeautiful setting, and that proved to be true. Luis Eduardo, Pablo, and I werethere to provide entertainment in the form of our lectures. The group would betaking ayahuasca with Francisco, who had begun practicing vegetalismo, and withsome other local practitioners. Luis Eduardo and Pablo had not been on goodterms since their falling out over the art school in Pucallpa a few yearsearlier, but they both agreed to show up. We were hoping the reunion would bringsome healing and reconciliation, which it did, although the truce was an uneasyone.Among the interesting people there was a gentleman with some serious mentalissues. For one, he believed he was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ and hadcome back to earth to overcome a coven of witches and warlocks who were bent ondestroying the world. This evil cabal turned out to be us—the workshopparticipants. He became convinced we had lured him there to kill him. Mutteringdarkly under his breath, he let us now know he was on to us and, come nightfall,“the tables would turn.” He was quite serious about it and at one point tore offinto the forest in a paranoid mania. Another group member, Bill, probably thesanest among us, found him hours later in a farmer’s yard, sitting in the lotusposition and wearing only a towel, with a machete stuck into the ground besidehim. After thirty or forty minutes of conversation, during which the guy didn’topen his eyes, Bill convinced him to find a hotel room in town and get somerest. The guy’s girlfriend, who had brought him to the workshop, later confidedthat he’d suffered these paranoid delusions for years and that she’d hoped theayahuasca could help him.Earlier, in a lucid moment, he told a fascinating story about how he had curedhis severe dyslexia in adolescence using high doses of LSD. He’d always haddifficulty reading, he said, because the letters just seemed to float off thepage. Apparently, he’d taken LSD to play football in high school, believing thatit improved his game. He was a good player, and his skill helped him gain socialacceptance despite his learning disabilities; maybe LSD could help him tacklethose as well. He described to me how, in a series of high-dose sessions, he wasable to visualize the “wiring” in his brain, as he put it, and the “damagedfiling cabinets” where his linguistic functions resided. In a shamanic act ofpsychic neurosurgery, he then identified a set of “alternate” cabinets andtransferred his linguistic functions into them. After that, he never had anyproblems with dyslexia, he said. He read easily and enjoyed it.I have no reason to doubt his story, though it obviously warrants skepticism inlight of his mental health issues. It did lead me to speculate about the use ofLSD as a potential treatment for dyslexia. We have a limited understanding ofneuroplasticity, to say nothing of how psychedelics might affect it. That man’sanecdote hints at the curious link between psychedelics and language, as do themore prevalent accounts of synesthesia I’ve discussed earlier. Psychedelics havesome fundamental relationship to the way our brains create meaning andunderstanding out of sounds and images. I’m convinced that furtherinvestigations into this phenomenon would yield new insights.Another participant was Jill, Terence’s ex-girlfriend. The two had very recentlysplit up, and one reason she attended the workshop was to look for someunderstanding and peace of mind. I’d gotten to know her somewhat on my visits toHawaii while she and Terence were together; back then I’d mistaken her quietself-possession and reserve for shyness. I knew their parting had hurt her,though I believe it had been her choice. I was still feeling a lot of turmoilover my own relationship with Terence and, fairly or otherwise, Jill’sexperience may have heightened those emotions, which started surfacing for me inthe Ayahuasca sessions. They were difficult sessions, very dark and disturbing.I kept seeing images of Terence with a black shadow in the center of his chest,a black, hard knot located over his heart. Given my feelings at the time, Iinterpreted this as an expression of his coldness and lack of compassion. Onlylater did I understand what the Ayahuasca was really showing me. It was aforeshadowing, literally, of a black tumor, the seeds of which even then wereforming, though in my anger I had misplaced its location. I can’t vouch for thevalidity of this perception, of course. It was an Ayahuasca vision, after all.But in reflection, I have come to believe this is what I’d been shown—apremonition of the nightmare to come, still more than a year in the future.Indeed, the rest of 1998 passed quietly. Terence went to the Palenque“entheobotany” event as usual, and in May he visited us briefly in Minnesotawhen he came out to speak at the Whole Life Expo in St. Paul. He informed methat he had a new girlfriend, Christy, whom he’d met in Palenque, a young womanfrom Ohio. I wouldn’t actually meet her for another year, but her age alone,twenty-five, had me privately conjuring up all sorts of presumptions about whatshe had to be like. Surely as impatient with me as I was with him, Terencewasn’t in the mood to care what I thought, so we really didn’t discuss it. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 49 - A Desperate Situation [images/00034.jpg]> Aunt Amelia, Terence, Christy, and Dennis, 1999. By the spring of 1999, Terence was living with Christy in his recently completedhouse on the Big Island. He was busy dealing with various investors and othersinvolved in organizing an event to be held on the island in September, theAllChemical Arts Conference. Billed as an exploration of the relationshipbetween hallucinogens and the creative process, the event would feature Terenceas the keynote speaker, followed by other well-known figures in the psychedelicand visionary arts community, including Alex Grey, Robert Venosa, AnnieSprinkle, Tom Robbins, Mark Pesce, Bruce Damer, and others. It was going to bequite an event.I wasn’t invited, which was OK with me; I was more on the science side of thingsand would not have had much to contribute. Terence and I hadn’t fully resolvedthe tensions that had developed between us over the last few years, but we wereat least getting along. In the meantime, I was busy producing theherbal-supplement desk reference and lining up other consulting gigs. I wasn’tfocused on developments in Hawaii.I got the news on May 23, when I picked up a voice mail left the previous day onmy office phone. It was from Dan Levy, Terence’s friend and former editor.Terence had suffered some kind of seizure, Dan said, and was currently in TheQueen’s Medical Center in Honolulu, where he had been airlifted by helicopter.I immediately called Dan to get the full story. He wasn’t sure exactly what hadhappened, he said, but he’d gotten an urgent message from Christy. Terence hadrecently returned from a long, exhausting tour on the East coast, she said, andhad been feeling poorly for several days. He’d been suffering flu-like symptomsand had taken to his bed. That alone was not unusual. Terence was oftenexhausted after a tour and would sometimes be sick for a few days afterward. Butthis time was different; he hadn’t bounced back. As Christy told Dan, Terencehad gotten up at one point and suffered a massive seizure. They both knew thiswas serious, and he had to get to the hospital. Somehow, Christy managed to getTerence into their jeep and started careening down the hill on the rugged roadas Terence faded in and out of consciousness. She had called 911 from theInternet phone connection; they had no cell phones. While they waited at thebottom for the ambulance, Terence had another seizure, lost consciousness, andappeared near death.Christy flagged down two passing motorcyclists for help. As it turned out, oneof them had EMT training and was able to resuscitate Terence, almost certainlysaving his life. The ambulance finally arrived, and the paramedics administeredanti-seizure medication and took him to Kona Community Hospital. At thehospital, a CT scan revealed no signs of an aneurism, but it did detect what wascalled a “shadow” in the right anterior part of Terence’s brain. That was allDan knew, but the word tumor hovered unspoken in the air.I hung up the phone and collected my thoughts. I made arrangements to leaveimmediately for Honolulu.When the taxi left me off at the medical center after an overnight flight,Christy was already there, as was Terence’s son, Finn, who had been staying nearhim on the Big Island. It was the first time I’d met Christy, who was blonde,blue-eyed, and petite. Her feat of getting Terence down to the road seemed thatmuch more remarkable when I saw how small she was. We would get to know eachother well over the following months. Terence’s daughter, Klea, was in Europewhen she got the news; she soon arrived as well.Terence had gotten an MRI by then, and the higher-resolution technologyconfirmed our worst fears. There was a dark mass, a tumor, about the size of awalnut, buried deep in his right forebrain. It would take a biopsy to determinethe type of cancer, but we all feared the worst: glioblastoma multiforme, themost common and aggressive form of brain cancer. Fewer than two percent ofglioblastoma sufferers survive more than a year after their tumors are detected.It’s a rare cancer (about 20,000 cases in the United States each year) and allbut incurable: surgery and radiation might prolong life at most a few months.Terence’s neuro-oncologist was a compassionate man and an excellent doctor. Healso struck me as one of the more depressed physicians I’d ever met, possiblybecause, as a specialist in this lethal disease, he’d never saved a singlepatient. His advice to Terence was blunt: he advised him to put his affairs inorder. Terence might have a year to live, probably less, and no more thaneighteen months. The chances that the tumor was benign were slim to none, thedoctor said, and the biopsy soon verified that.By the time we had this conversation at Terence’s bedside, he was feeling prettygood. He’d been given massive doses of anti-seizure medicine and steroids toreduce swelling. The combined effects, bizarrely, made him slightly euphoric andpumped. He was sitting up in bed, fully conscious, no pain, cracking jokes,while the rest of us were looking glum. The hospital had a nice inner courtyardand garden, and Finn and Terence and I sat there for a while under an enormousbanyan tree in the late afternoon sun and tried to sort things out. I wasagitated, overwhelmed with feelings of fear, apprehension, helplessness, anddesperation. Any residual anger with Terence over our petty differences hadevaporated. My job was to be there for my brother as fully as I could.My conversation with him in the garden was intense and strange. It was almost asif we were back at La Chorrera, twenty-eight years earlier and thousands ofmiles away. This was the next twist of the helix, I told him; what we hadstarted at La Chorrera was not finished. Our experiment was still in progressand only now nearing its resolution. We were about to encounter each otheragain, moving backwards and forwards in time, as we had been then, and eversince. But now it was my turn to be the anchor, the one who stayed behind;Terence would be the hyperspatial explorer, the one taking the shamanic hero’sjourney to the edge of the universe, perhaps never to return.I don’t know where my inspiration came from, whether I was channeling theTeacher, which is what it felt like, or whether I was slipping again into somekind of manic state. Perhaps I was just trying to frame the conversation interms that were familiar, and that would give Terence (and all of us) some hope.But I had a clear vision of the task in front of us. I told him our theory at LaChorrera had been right: beta-carbolines and tryptamines did intercalate intoDNA, as other investigators since then had confirmed. The brain tumor, like anytumor, was a mass of rapidly dividing cells. We had to carry out what amountedto shamanic surgery, by administering massive doses of Ayahuasca and/orpsilocybin, and directing sound energy—the “hypercarbolation buzz”—at the tumor.The buzz would trigger the intercalation of the compounds and would blockreplication of DNA in the rapidly growing cells. The net effect would be toarrest the growth of the tumor and cause it to shrink.That was the best outcome; but if it didn’t work, I said, our shamanic surgerywould build Terence’s resurrection body; we’d reconstruct him as the starship,the hyper-dimensional object, the philosopher’s stone, all the images of asuper-technological fusion of mind and matter we’d invoked at La Chorrera. Inother words, the treatment would either save Terence, or transform him into ahyper-dimensional vehicle that, at the moment of transition, would allow him toseize the controls and sail off, painlessly, joyfully, and triumphantly, intothe sunset of eternity. We’d almost done that in La Chorrera; this was oursecond chance.I really don’t know why I was saying these things. I was babbling, grasping atstraws, reaching for any metaphor, any scenario, that might cast a hopeful lighton this terrible situation. I don’t know that I really believed it, but I wassaying it.Over the previous summer, I’d been doing Ayahuasca workshops with Luis Eduardo.I knew he’d been planning to visit Hawaii in July, which suddenly seemedprovidential. Luis Eduardo, one of our closest friends, had become an excellentayahuasquero. I’ve told the story of how Terence had met him after his secondtrip to La Chorrera, and how later Luis Eduardo and I worked and traveledtogether over the years, sharing many adventures. We’d invite him to take partin this shamanic work with us, I said. I don’t know if my raving convincedTerence, but he reluctantly agreed at least to give it a try.Back in the world of allopathic medicine, Terence was facing very limitedoptions. His biopsy had confirmed that the tumor was indeed glioblastomamultiforme. Moreover, the tumor was inoperable. Conventional chemotherapy drugstended to be ineffective, the oncologist said, because they didn’t readily crossthe blood-brain barrier and thus had trouble penetrating the tumor. With surgeryruled out, his doctor recommended a procedure called “gamma knife,” whichtargeted the tumor with a beam of focused, high-energy gamma radiation. The beamcould potentially “stun” the tumor and slow its growth, or even force it intoremission in rare cases. That procedure would be followed by six weeks offocused soft-radiation therapy to catch any surviving cancer cells. Such tumorsoften recurred; the follow-up therapy improved the chances of remission afterthe initial gamma-knife procedure. According to the doctor, the diffuse borderof such a tumor sends articulations into the normal surrounding tissue. Hecompared these to “mycelia,” as opposed to the “fruiting body” of the main tumormass.What were the long-term consequences if the treatments actually worked? Mostlikely dementia, we were told: possibly moderate, possibly severe. To think ofmy brother’s beautiful, scintillating mind being eaten away by a malignancy, orburned away by radiation, left me shaken. There were no good options. The gammaknife, crude as it was, seemed better than nothing. We agreed that the bestcourse would be to have the procedure and then see what happened. After a brieftime to recover, Terence would then begin the follow-up radiation treatments,which were intended to buy time and quality of life during that time. Thetreatments were never referred to as a cure.Word of Terence’s situation soon got out. Jill, his former girlfriend, showed upunexpectedly, having flown over from the Big Island as soon as she’d gotten thenews. I was surprised and impressed by her compassion for Terence. To hiscredit, Terence received her warmly, and Christy did as well. Christy certainlyhadn’t bargained for anything like this when she and Terence had hooked up. Now,as the person closest to Terence on a day-to-day basis, she’d been cast into thestressful role of primary caregiver, and she proved herself more than equal tothe task.Dan Levy, Terence’s agent, flew out from New York to see him. Thanks to thesteroids and the anti-seizure meds, Terence felt quite well, and there was noreason for him to stay in the hospital after he’d recovered from the biopsyprocedure. Friends who had places on Oahu offered us accommodations whileTerence awaited the gamma knife procedure. The situation was almost surreal. Wewere going out for expensive meals every night and acting like a bunch of goodfriends on holiday. Terence seemed more cheerful and upbeat than I had seen himin some time.A few days after the biopsy, the gamma knife “cybersurgery” went off without ahitch, as far as any one could tell. This high-tech procedure was akin to magicin that it harnessed invisible energies whose effectiveness we accepted onfaith. Our faith was in science and technology, of course, but afterward therewas no outward sign that anything had changed. Terence looked the same and feltthe same, except for a little fatigue. But the docs assured us they had zappedthe tumor good; there was nothing to do but wait. Their plan was to monitor theeffects for a few weeks and then begin the six weeks of radiation therapy.Terence and Christy went home to the Big Island. I returned to Minnesota tohandle some business matters and clear the decks as much as possible. We agreedthat I would come back out later in the summer with Luis Eduardo after Terencehad completed his radiation therapy in Honolulu.As May turned into June and the weeks rolled on, word of Terence’s diresituation reached his fans. Many responded with an incredible outpouring of goodwishes, love-energy, and many suggestions for alternative therapies. It wastouching, and humbling, to realize that Terence was loved by so many. He had anenormous extended family, and everyone was pulling for him. It became impossiblefor him to respond to the hundreds of emails he got every day. Fortunately, DanLevy, who maintained the levity.com servers where Terence’s website was housed,set up a page where we could post periodic updates, which are still there(www.levity.com/eschaton/index.html[http://www.levity.com/eschaton/index.html]).This excerpt from a post by Terence gives some hint of what he was thinking atthe time: > June 25, 1999> Dear Novelty Folks:> I am not properly set up, mentally or technologically to receive or respond to> email while I am in Honolulu getting my cancer treatments, but my goal is to> come home to my secret rebel base on the Big Island every two weekends or so.> And once again I am there.

The optimistic tone of my own posts on thesite mentioned above belied my true state of mind. I was anguished. There seemedto be no escape from this, all the evidence pointed to this disease being adeath sentence; it was only a matter of time. But we were furiously searchingfor a solution.We had plenty of help. The daughter of my friend Sid had a different kind ofbrain tumor, astrocytoma, and had been able to survive far beyond projectedexpectations using a number of different complementary and conventionaltreatments. Sid and his daughter and her physician were compassionate andgenerous about sharing information, and we were grateful for their advice.Sadly, considering how rare glioblastoma was supposed to be (I’m not sure Ibelieve the statistics), our former neighbor from NIH days in Bethesda, Woody,came down with the same type of cancer at about the same time, so we weresharing information and support with his wife Cathy. Woody also succumbed to thedisease, as most did, and still do.Because Sheila and I were the only ones in our group with any background inscience or biomedicine, it fell to us to scour the medical literature to try toidentify some treatments that might offer a solution. We spent several hours aday on Pubmed, trying to learn more about the disease, and we started searchingthe NIH-sponsored site for new therapies undergoing clinical trials(www.clinicaltrials.gov [http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/]) to see if there mightbe any new trials that could help Terence. It’s a daunting and thankless task.Every clinical protocol has strict exclusion criteria, and if one has hadcertain prior treatments, a candidate may be disqualified for an experimentaltherapy even though it may seem promising. One becomes trapped in a vastdecision-tree matrix; a decision to go with one clinical protocol often slamsthe door on others, due to the exclusion criteria. Every decision becomeslife-or-death, and there is no way to determine which is which. It’s impossibleto know if you are making the right decision or not. Or that’s how it feels.This was the dilemma we were in. In the end, given the outcome that we now know,none of the decisions that we made were the correct ones, the outcome would inall probability have been the same for Terence no matter what course we chose.Sometime during this period, while Terence was shuttling back and forth toHonolulu for his treatments, I met some friends in California for a weekend.They had rented a beautiful condo and had what they said was a new LSD analogthey wanted to share, which in retrospect I think was really just LSD. I was upfor it. I was quite distressed about the situation with Terence, and I thoughtthe experience might help me get some perspective on it.The material we took was in a crystal form, in a tiny vial. We had no scale andhad to “eyeball” the doses as best we could. However much I took, it was muchmore LSD than I had ever taken in my life, there was no doubt of that. It wasone hell of a ride. The effects came on within minutes, and within minutes I wasso out of it I was oblivious to everything except what was going on inside myhead. And that was all about Terence and our shared dilemma. I saw the tumor asan evil black spider extending its lethal web through Terence’s brain; he was aninsect futilely struggling in that web, desperately seeking an escape. A voicekept insisting, “The only way out is to go in.” I took that to mean there reallywas no escape, that death was the only escape. I confronted that idea with allthe grief, anxiety, and fear that I’d been keeping bottled inside. I thoughtabout Terence’s death, and what that would mean, and the aftermath, and thesadness and grieving that would inevitably follow. It was as if I had beengranted an opportunity to experience all of that grief in advance, go through itthen and there and get past it, in order to cleanse my system of all thatnegative energy and be ready for the ordeal that lay ahead.There was nothing fun about the trip, but it was healing and therapeutic in theslap-you-upside-the-head way that psychedelics can be sometimes. It was a hardlesson, shoved into my face: “Deal with it,” was the message. “You can’t escapefrom this ordeal. The only way out is to go in.” Terence finished his radiation treatments in early August and settled in athome, waiting to see what would unfold. Klea and Finn spent a great deal of timewith their father that summer, and indeed over the hard months after it, acrucial part of the story they alone can tell, as the most important people inTerence’s life. Various friends traveled to Hawaii to see him. Caitlin and Ispent time with him, as did our Aunt Amelia. Terence grumbled about having “thatold battle-ax” around, but there was no stopping her. Amelia could be as gruffand abrasive as Terence when she wanted to be. In the end I think he appreciatedher effort. It could not have been easy for an eighty-six-year-old woman, butshe insisted, as if to say: I’m here, I love you, and you’re just going to haveto deal with it.Shortly after Caitlin returned to the mainland, Luis Eduardo showed up. We werepreparing to initiate the program of shamanic surgery I’d discussed with Terencein the hospital garden. Terence didn’t seem very enthusiastic about the idea.“What’s this all about?” he asked me. “What do you think is going to happen?” Itold him I didn’t really know. At best, I said, we’d cure his cancer and he’d beOK. If not, I hoped he’d have an epiphany of some kind that would help him cometo terms with the fact of his illness and the possibility of death. He wasskeptical.“Let’s just try it,” I said. “We don’t know what will happen. Eduardo, your bestfriend, has come all this way to help you, I’m here for you, we all love you; Ithink you should at least try.” Reluctantly, he agreed.But in the end it didn’t work. Terence was not spared, nor did our actionsreally lead him to a moment of insight. I had secured some strong Ayahuascabrew, but there was debate about whether Terence could safely take it. Thethought was that pure psilocybin would be much easier on him.Over the next couple of weeks, the ayahuasqueros at least had occasion to takeplenty of these medicines. We sang icaros, we blew mapacho, we sucked virotes,we massaged Terence’s head; we danced around and made the hypercarbolationscream. We told Amelia what we were doing, and she totally got it. In oursessions, we sat around a small fire in front of Terence’s deck, and when weweren’t shamanizing, we talked. Terence only took a small amount of psilocybin,and for him the effects were light and recreational. He was obviously enjoyinghimself, but our conversations had no depth; Terence described them as a milewide and an inch deep. I didn’t know how to steer us in a more productivedirection. Our recent tensions had not been entirely forgotten. My brotherobviously distrusted me and held himself back.My consoling thought was that no one could decide for another how to confrontdeath. Terence had to choose his own way, which he bravely did. We tried to helphim, tried to ease the pain for him, and for others around him; but like hisother treatments, shamanic surgery had failed. August faded into September. Luis Eduardo returned to Finland, and I went hometo Minnesota. Terence, who was still feeling pretty good, remained on the BigIsland with Christy. The AllChemical Arts Conference took place in mid-Septemberand by all accounts was a great success. His wider community was aware that theevent was quite possibly his last major public appearance, and that put thefocus even more on him. He gave some of his best talks and interviews during theconference, which I think marked the start of a gradual process of letting go,both for him and for his fans.By late September matters were becoming urgent; the effects of Terence’streatments with the gamma knife and the subsequent radiation therapy werebeginning to wear off. The tumor’s growth had slowed for a short while, but nowit had resumed. I continued to search the literature for a clinical trial thatmight prove to be the escape hatch we all were hoping for. Finally, afterevaluating many clinical trials and consulting with Terence’s physicians andother experts, we found a clinical trial that seemed to hold promise. It was oneof the early experiments in gene therapy, an industry-sponsored Phase I clinicalstudy being conducted at the University of California, San Francisco MedicalCenter, home to one of the best neuro-oncology departments in the world. We wereinitially concerned because Terence’s oncologist in Honolulu had assessed histumor as inoperable. But his surgeon in San Francisco was confident the tumorcould be removed as the first step prior to the gene-therapy stage. It seemedlike the closest thing to a magic bullet that we had found. It was our best andlast hope.Both phases of the operation went well. Here’s part of the update I postedafterward: > October 12, 1999> Terence successfully completed the second phase of his treatment at UCSF> today. He had a craniotomy, followed by additional gene therapy. The surgery> was a success by all measures. According to the surgeon…all visible traces of> the tumor have been removed.

Following the operation, Terence and Christy remained in San Francisco, livingin an apartment close to the UCSF Medical Center, kindly offered by a friend.This made it easier to check in for the close follow-up that the procedurerequired, and so far everything looked good. Terence seemed to be rallying abit. The operation had gone as well as expected, and that alone gave us somehope. Now it was a matter of waiting to see if the gene therapy worked, whichwould be indicated if the tumor had stopped growing and was beginning to shrink.The next major checkup for Terence was scheduled for late January. He andChristy returned to the Big Island in late October.During November and December, we were permitting ourselves to think that thishigh-tech approach just might have worked. The message of my LSD experience sixmonths earlier came back to remind me that the only way out was to go in. Well,Terence’s doctors had gone in and excised the malignant spider that had taken upresidence there. Now it only remained to see if, in fact, this procedure hadcreated a way out.After recovering from surgery, Terence felt better than he had in a while, butthat respite didn’t last long. Soon after returning to Hawaii, he developed agreat deal of pain in his left leg. His doctors thought that both his pain andloss of strength might have been related to his steroid medications, which canbreak down muscle tissue. Terence had been taking steroids since his initialdiagnosis, and his doses had gone up following the operation. The doctorssuggested that he gradually taper off the steroids, and by late December he had;but after a brief period when his symptoms seem to improve slightly, they gotworse.It was a dreary Christmas for all of us. Terence and Christy remained inseclusion on the Big Island, the situation becoming ever more dire. I was inMinnesota with my family, trying to pretend that we were celebrating a normalChristmas, but we all knew better. Minnesota was in the grip of its usual icywinter, and I became obsessed with keeping the fire going in the new woodstovewe’d installed a few months earlier as our single hedge against Y2K. At least itwas something I could do: keep my family warm in the face of winter andimpending global disaster.In a bizarre prefiguration of the events predicted for 2012, much of the worldseemed on the verge of Y2K hysteria. The computer wonks were predicting theimminent collapse of civilization due to the so-called Millennium Bug: computersystems the world over would abruptly malfunction as their clocks switched overfrom 1999 to 2000. By convention, computerized calendrical systems used the lasttwo digits of the year to program dates instead of all four digits. The fear wasthat these systems would mistake 2000 for 1900, and the entire global Internetwould crash, triggering a new dark age as our short-lived digital age ended inchaos.As it turned out, nothing much happened. Whether the worldwide preventivemeasures actually worked or the danger had been exaggerated was never clear. (Isuspect the latter). Whatever the case, Y2K turned out to be a giant non-event.Back on the home front, we were so preoccupied we barely noticed. Terence and Christy returned to the Bay Area for his checkup in January. I wasthere as well, having put my work and other activities aside. They were planningto continue on from there to the Entheobotany Conference in Palenque inmid-February, but that was looking unlikely. Terence’s problems had worsened. AnMRI during his checkup revealed that the tumor had metastasized. This wasunexpected and disturbing; it is extremely rare for glioblastomas to spreadbeyond the site of initial growth. There was no way to determine if this was anunintended consequence of the gene therapy, but it may have been.In any case, the doctors more or less threw up their hands. There was nothingmore they could do, they said. They thanked Terence for making his contributionto science and sent him home. The tumor was now proliferating in critical areasclose to the autonomic centers that regulate cardiac and respiratory functions.If he was “lucky”—the term sounded pretty hollow at this point—he would live sixmonths. In all likelihood, his time on earth would be much shorter, closer tothree or four months.After that news, Palenque was out of the question. Terence had no energy and nolonger any will to fight the thing. What he wanted was to go home to the BigIsland, but even that simple wish could not be granted to him. Christy could notbe expected to take care of him alone, in a remote place with no easy access toemergency care. She was willing to try, but Terence’s friends Jack and Riccijoined me in saying that wouldn’t work.Jack and Ricci had a place in Marin, a nice suburban house they rented in SanRafael, overlooking an inlet of San Rafael Bay. They invited Terence and Christyto stay with them. It was there that Terence passed his final days. I respectJack and Ricci for taking on a task that turned them into caregivers, guardians,and gatekeepers. They arranged for Terence to have access to hospice care ifneeded; they engaged a pain specialist to manage his pain medications as hiscondition worsened. They created and maintained a firewall to protect Terencefrom the many fans that, out of misguided love, were desperate to connect withhim—and from several old girlfriends who wanted to reconnect. Betsy, anothermember of their circle, offered me the use of a studio with a spare bedroom inher house if I should need it—the first of many kindnesses she has extended tomy family since then.Terence was rapidly declining; within the space of a week he had lost theability to walk with a cane and was confined to a wheelchair. About this time,Jack and Ricci arranged to have a farewell party for Terence. Some of his oldestand best friends were there, including Vanessa, who had played the role of the“responsible adult” at La Chorrera. Others from the early Berkeley days showedup, and Terence was clearly moved, as were we all. Everyone knew they weresaying goodbye.Throughout February and March, Terence continued to lose strength and energy.Klea, who had started her freshman year in the fall at UCLA, had transferred toUC Santa Cruz to be closer to her father. I returned to the Bay Area with myfamily in mid-March. Ralph Metzner had organized a conference entitled“Ayahuasca, Shamanism, and Spirituality,” sponsored by the California Instituteof Integral Studies, and held at the Cathedral Hill Hotel in San Francisco.Metzner had just published and edited a collection of essays and scientificarticles on ayahuasca, and the conference was in part a platform to promote thebook (Metzner 1999). I spoke at the event, along with others in the Ayahuascafield, including my colleagues from the UDV study, Charlie Grob and JaceCallaway. Luis Eduardo was also there, as were Jeremy Narby and attorney RoyHaber, who was working to secure recognition for the Santo Daime under theReligious Freedom Restoration Act. It was an excellent conference, one of thefirst on the topic in the Bay Area. Sheila had not seen Terence since beforehe’d been diagnosed, and Caitlin had not seen him since the previous summer inHawaii.We planned to go to Marin to see him after the conference, not exactly a joyfulreunion, but an important one. The first day of the conference, March 17, waswarm and sunny, and we were all standing around by the pool after breakfast,waiting for the program to start. Sheila, Cait, and I were talking to LuisEduardo and Roy. I looked away for a minute and when I looked back, Sheila haddisappeared; next thing I knew, she was emerging from the swimming pool, fullyclothed and dripping wet, clutching a child to her chest. While the rest of uswere standing around distracted in conversation, Cait had spotted a small childmotionless at the bottom of the pool and had alerted Sheila. Sheila’s EMTtraining kicked in: she dove into the pool and rescued the little girl, laid herby the side of the pool, and administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. LuisEduardo stepped in to help and found that she had a pulse, so Sheila couldcontinue with her mouth-to-mouth. The rest of us stood by watching, stunned.After a few minutes, the girl coughed up some water, took a deep breath and letout a lusty cry. Sheila had saved her life! It turned out it was Roy’s daughter,at the time about five years old. Roy and his wife were deeply shaken, ofcourse, and extremely grateful to Sheila. The paramedics took her to thehospital where she fully recovered. By the next day, she was at the conference,dancing around. That frightening moment created a bond between Sheila and Roythat has continued to this day.Following the conference, Sheila, Cait, and I went with Luis Eduardo to Marin tosee Terence. He was confined to his bed, and the encounter was difficult for allof us. What words can one find to speak to a dying man? Cait, eleven at thetime, became upset as it dawned on her that she’d probably never see her unclealive again. We all eventually confront the proof of life’s brevity in the faceof someone dear to us. That was the lesson Cait was learning as her beloveduncle tried to wipe her tears and reassure her.After spending a night or two in Marin at Betsy’s place, we flew back toMinnesota. A few days later, I returned to be with Terence. Time was growingshort. When I got back to Marin on March 28, it was clear that things had takena dramatic turn for the worse. There had been a traumatic event of some kind; itappeared to me that he’d suffered a stroke that had rendered him largelyparalyzed and aphasic.In my absence, other events had occurred, the consequences of which I would notfully grasp until later. It seemed there had been conversations with Terence, ifthat’s what you’d call such exchanges when the key person cannot speak, aboutchanging his will. The changes involved the distribution of some of hisproperties, particularly his cherished library. At some point, one of Terence’sfriends had visited his house on the Big Island and returned with a photographicinventory of some of Terence’s possessions—mostly art objects like his Tibetanthangkas. Apparently at Terence’s request, another friend had called in lawyersover the weekend to rewrite Terence’s will. I didn’t learn what the changes wereuntil after Terence had died. I was suspicious and wondered why I had beenexcluded from these conversations. Just prior to my return to Minnesota, I hadasked Terence to name me the executor of his will. He granted my request, but itturned out to be a burdensome responsibility, as I later found out.During this period, I was staying at Betsy’s and spending every day withTerence, a vigil I shared with Klea and Finn. It’s not easy to be with someonewho is dying, especially when they are unable to speak. The time passed slowly.My cousin Judy and her husband Laddie, in the area visiting their daughter, cameby to pay their respects. In a moment I described earlier in the book, our AuntTress, whom Terence had been on the outs with since high school, phoned to offersome words of comfort. I spent long hours by Terence’s bedside, sometimesreading, sometimes sharing passages aloud, often just sitting in silence. Italked to Terence, trying to overcome my anguish, to say something meaningful.It was surprising how hard it was to get these simple words out: I love you. Iforgive you. I ask that you forgive me. That was what I needed to say. Therewasn’t much point in trying to say anything more than that. I’m pretty sure thathe heard me, though he couldn’t respond.I was not at Terence’s bedside when the end came. It happened at 2:15 a.m. onthe third of April. His children and I had been with him the previous evening.Around ten or eleven we said goodnight, and Finn and I went to our lodgings atBetsy’s. Terence didn’t respond to our farewells, because he couldn’t. Christywas the only one with him at the end. Suddenly, he came fully awake, liftedhimself up from the mattress, and tried to say something. His face wastransfixed in an expression of ecstasy. Then, he settled back, let out a longsigh, and was gone. Christy walked to the window and looked out across the bay;the sky was cloudless and clear; it was the darkest hour. As she stood andwatched, a shooting star flared and faded in the night. At least, she said thishappened, and I believe her, because I want to believe her. I know it was Terryin his crystal ship, kicking it into warp drive, accelerating smoothly intohyperspace. Just like we always said it would be.The news arrived the next morning when Christy came over to tell us. I actuallyheard it from Finn as I was descending the stairs from Betsy’s studio. When hetold me, I let out an involuntary wail, an anguished cry like a wounded animal.I have never made a sound like that, before or since. I couldn’t have preventedit, even if I had wanted to. Something reached into me at that moment and toreout a piece of my soul. After that, I was just stunned. We went back to thehouse together. It was like being in a dream; there was a strange, muffledquality to external sounds, almost like my head was wrapped in gauze. We walkedin and there was Terence, on his bed in his room. His face expressed ecstasy andpeace. My beautiful brother, my mentor and tormentor, was gone. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter 50 - Into the Fire In keeping with Tibetan Buddhist practice, the body of a departed spirit shouldbe left undisturbed for a few days. The soul is at a critical point oftransition, and this final link to the world of the living should be maintained,to let the soul take its leave in peace, and in its own time. Though we were notpracticing Buddhists, similar practices are found in many shamanic traditions,and it seemed to make sense. So Terence stayed with us in his bed at Jack andRicci’s place while I arranged for a cremation at the Mount Tamalpais Mortuary.The ceremony on April 6 was simple and small. Finn and Klea did not attend,having chosen to honor their father in their own way. Only Christy and I, andTerence’s old friends Lisa and Erik, loyal to the end, were present. Terencelooked good. He was lying in a cardboard casket, dressed in his favorite tweedjacket, with amulets and necklaces from his close friends encircling his neck.He looked at peace. We closed up the casket, which was elevated on a bed ofrollers. The attendants slid it into the oven and closed the door. We retired tothe chapel to wait. It took just over an hour for the cremation to be finished.There were no sermons, nothing formal. We sat around and reminisced, about thedays in Berkeley and even earlier, the days in Menlo Park and Lancaster whenTerence was just Terry and we were just happy hippies, unknown and obscure, fullof hope and idealism, dreams and delusions. How young and innocent and guilelesswe were back then.A year or so after the cremation, I had an Ayahuasca experience in which Irelived the cremation from Terence’s point of view. In my vision, it was just aflash of searing flames and heat, and it seems right somehow that it should bethat way. At least that was the vision of cremation that I was granted byayahuasca. I have no idea if it matches reality or not, but I was grateful toshare the experience vicariously with Terence. After all, we had shared so muchin life, to the point where at times I had felt we were like one person. Itseemed fitting somehow to be able to share this final moment of alchemicaltransmutation.Even in the face of death, life, ever impatient, hastens us along to the nextact. We are not permitted the luxury of indulging the impulse to pause andreflect. That’s how it seemed after Terence’s death. Even before Terence’s bodywas consigned to the flames, I was summoned to a meeting at the lawyer’s officefor a reading of the new will, the one that had been crafted in secret and in myabsence. Terence’s former will was a simple, two-page document that basicallystated his intent to bequeath all of his possessions to his children. The newwill was a ten-page, densely worded document with an eleven-page appendixspecifying gifts of specific personal property. It had been drafted and signedon March 24, a day during the period when I had been absent. Nothing about itsat well with me. I wondered how Terence, in the terminal stages of braincancer, unable to speak and perhaps not fully capable of clarity of thought,could have participated in the drafting of such a document when his only way torespond would have been to raise a finger or nod. It seemed to me that hischildren had gotten short shrift. In particular, the new will specified thatTerence’s beloved library was to be placed in a trust under the curatorship of awealthy couple, friends of Terence’s and benefactors of the Esalen Institute.Terence had promised the library to Finn and Klea in earlier conversations inthe summer of 1999, one of which I witnessed. The revised will nullified hisintent as he had expressed it prior to his apparent change of heart. Accordingto the new will, the library was to be donated to the Esalen Institute afterprobate had been settled.I was named as the executor of Terence’s will, as I had requested of him. I hadno previous experience with legal matters of this kind, and I wanted to carryout my duties within the letter of the law. I was also still grieving; the willwas read two days after Terence’s death, and I don’t think I was thinkingclearly. Looking back on it, had I been thinking more clearly, and had I betterunderstood my prerogatives and rights as the executor and next of kin, I wouldhave contested the will on the spot, on the grounds that Terence had not been ofsound mind when it was drafted. But I did not take such action at the time, andthe opportunity was lost.The probate process turned into a can of worms that dragged on for years. Itcaused me a great deal of stress as I tried to balance my fiduciary duties withmy wish to heal some wounds and find closure. Other than his art and his books,Terence had no real assets, so in order to pay off his medical bills and otherexpenses I was forced to put the house in Hawaii up for sale. This was difficultbecause the property was part of a collective ownership agreement and had nofree title and no insurance. It took years, but I eventually found a person whowas willing to buy Terence’s “shares” in the hui. Though far from perfect, itwas the best resolution of the matter that I could manage under thecircumstances.Fulfilling Terence’s directive to bequeath the library to Esalen was the mostcontentious and stressful challenge I faced. Its resolution turned out to betragic. The executor of a will has a great deal of power; but that power must beexercised within constraints. The executor’s duty is to carry out the wishes ofthe deceased as expressed in the will, even if you disagree with those wishes. Ifelt this tension acutely. I was torn between wanting to do what I felt wasright and carrying out the directives of the will that, as the executor, I wasbound to do.I knew there would be problems within a couple of weeks after Terence’s death,when I received a strident and dictatorial document from a lawyer representingthe curators Terence had named. The point was to tell me what I was going to dowith the library and how the matter would be handled. I thought this wasunnecessarily adversarial, as I had every intention of carrying out thedirectives even though I didn’t agree with them. At the time, the library wasunder my protection as the executor, along with all assets of the estate. Thisis standard procedure in probated wills, because if there are liens against theestate, assets may have to be sold to settle the debts. None of the assets ofthe estate, even those bequeathed to other purposes, are shielded until theobligations are settled. In the case of Terence’s estate, there were liens,primarily because of medical bills, and the possibility existed that some of themore valuable titles in the library would have to be sold off. I had engaged theservices of a lawyer by this time, and had instructed her to notify the curatorsthat the library would be released to their curatorship only after probate hadbeen settled. Until then, any and all decisions regarding the assets of theestate were mine to make.Fate has a way of intervening in unexpected ways, and it did in the case ofTerence’s library. As the probate process ground on, I managed to work out anagreement with the curators about when and how to transfer the library toEsalen. The books sat in the house on the Big Island for far too long, but aftera time they were packed up and transferred to a storage facility in Kona. Thecurators and the estate reached an agreement to ship them to the mainland, wherethey were stored in a space overseen by Esalen in an old building in downtownMonterey. As I’ve noted earlier, the plan had been to store the books thereuntil a new building had been constructed where Terence’s collection, amongother works, could be suitably housed.On the evening of February 7, 2007, a fire broke out in a sub shop on the streetlevel of the building where Terence’s books and personal papers were stored. Theflames spread quickly, and Terence’s entire collection was soon lost. I didn’tlearn of this tragedy until the next morning when I picked up a voicemail fromDavid Price, who was the son of Esalen’s co-founder Dick Price, and who Terenceknew well from his long association with Esalen. Both David and Gordon Wheeler,Esalen’s CEO, were distraught and upset by this disaster, but I assured themthat I didn’t consider it their fault. The books were not insured separatelyfrom Esalen’s property insurance, so there was no possibility that the familywould receive some modest compensation for the loss. The books were stored atthe facility on shelves, so technically they were accessible as per theconditions of the bequest. But Terence’s wish, that they be accessible at a siteon the Esalen campus in Big Sur, had not been fulfilled.Although the administrators at Esalen expressed heartfelt regret over thistragedy, I never heard from the curators, a fact that speaks for itself. ThatTerence lost not one but two irreplaceable and unique libraries to fire—thefirst in Berkeley in 1970, and the second in 2007—is now part of his life story.It’s a double tragedy. Terence’s friend Erik Davis later posted a moving essayabout the loss on his website, Techgnosis. So much of Terence’s soul and beingwas bound up in his library it was almost like a living part of himself. Afterthis fire took that away, irrevocably and forever, I began to feel that he hadtruly departed this world.The conflicts that arose over Terence’s will, and the turmoil that created,dragged on for years and caused me great distress. Over the years, and withBetsy’s help, I have achieved a kind of closure with most of those involved. Idon’t see any point in nursing old grudges, as they poison mainly the personthat holds them, and there is already enough pain associated with Terence’slife, and death, to last the rest of mine. In the end (so I tell myself) we eachlived through these difficult times together, and each tried to do the rightthing. We differed in our understanding of what that was, but I give those withwhom I differed the benefit of the doubt. We may never be close friends, but Iwill always be grateful for what they did for Terence in his time of need. Thatmakes up for a lot. Time, in its way, just keeps flowing, no matter how much we might wish it wouldstop for a moment and let us catch our breath and gaze back along the distancewe have traveled. In my story, at least, I have arrived at such a point, and Ithink I’m going to leave it here. Terence’s departure from the realm of theliving on that early April morning of the year 2000 was not really the end ofhis story, or the end of mine, or the end of our intertwined destinies. A talesuch as ours never really ends, any more than it ever really begins; it is afrozen snapshot of an infinitesimal slice of time, pressed between the pages ofan expired past and indeterminate future like a dried flower in a weighty tome.We behold it for an instant highlighted by the strobe flash of scrutiny,reflection, and recollection; and then the light moves on, leaving only a fadingafterimage in the mind. Finally, even that vanishes into darkness and is gone.A lot has happened since Terence took his leave just over twelve years ago.During that period, our collective experience of historical time has acceleratedin a cascade of staggering events: the hijacked elections of 2000, the attackson 9/11, wars in the Middle East, earthquakes, tsunamis, oil spills, globalfinancial meltdown, looming environmental collapse, exploding technologicalchange. Terence didn’t live to witness these events, but they would not havesurprised him, as a prophet of his times. We are gripped by the intuition thatwe are heading toward some sort of unimaginable historical singularity; Terencearticulated this intuition for us. He envisioned the future in all its terrorand promise, and made that vision real for the rest of us. He made us reflect onour existential, cosmic, and historical dilemma; he made us think, he made uslaugh, and, most importantly, he gave us hope. It’s for that reason, I believe,that he speaks to us from the past in a voice that rings so true and timelytoday.An important part of me died with Terence; nevertheless I soldier on, diminishedand damaged but still standing, for how much longer I do not know. At times, myintuition tells me it won’t be that long; at other moments, I feel I could livefor decades. If I’ve learned anything from being granted a relatively long life,it’s that the whole point of the exercise is to live and cherish each day as ifit were our last. As trite as that sounds, it is a profound truth that requiresa lifetime to realize. As a milestone marking a finished leg in life’s journey,the completion of this book is an important one for me. Whether other works willfollow I cannot say. But this story is one I have wanted and needed to tell forsome time. I know it will be reviled and praised, criticized and mocked, lovedand condemned. Trust me; no one is more acutely aware than I am of its seriousimperfections. Yet, it’s the best I can manage. It’s a tale told as well as I amable to tell it. Make of it what you will. It’s the tale I set out to tell, andnow it is done. "},{"pageContent":"Epilogue Following Terence’s cremation, his ashes were divided among the important peoplein his life. Christy and I each got some, and a portion went to Terence’schildren. Over the years, those ashes have been scattered in many places,including the Big Island, the Black Canyon, and in Sonoma near where Terence hadlived with his wife and children. I had the mortuary send my portion to AuntMayme in Paonia for safekeeping, until we could have a memorial there forTerence. That finally took place in the summer of 2001. In a family gathering,we buried most of those ashes alongside our mother and father in Cedar HillCemetery, overlooking the valley. I kept a few ounces back, and after thememorial a few of us went camping in Lead King Basin near the headwaters of theCrystal River. I took the mason jar that held the ashes and walked alone alongthe trail beside the stream a short distance above our camp. I knelt beside thestream in a spot where the current flowed swiftly. I meditated for a fewminutes, then removed the lid and poured the ashes into the rushing water.“Goodbye, Terry,” I said, “now you are free.”I liked the thought of Terence’s ashes, the last remnants of his mortalsubstance, mixing with the water and soil and trees of the place where we hadspent our childhood. His molecules and atoms will diffuse out into the worldfrom there. Eventually, they might mingle with parts of himself deposited indifferent places. Eventually, he will be everywhere. "},{"pageContent":"Acknowledgments The writing of this memoir has consumed more than a year of my life, and it hasbeen an intensely personal, at times emotionally taxing experience. I willalways remain grateful for the confluence of circumstances and support from thebroad community of friends, family, and fellow travelers that gave me theopportunity to manifest this work in the real world. To borrow a phrase from oneof our favorite philosophers, Alfred North Whitehead, the book has now undergone“the formality of actually occurring.” Now that the formality is past, it’sclear that the book never would have happened were it not for a good deal ofluck, and the assistance and encouragement of many who participated in thebirthing process. It may be my story, but telling that story to the wider worldhas been a team effort.First of all, I want to thank those who are closest to my heart, and who havethe not always pleasant task of putting up with me from day to day: my wife,Sheila, and my daughter, Caitlin. Their support in this endeavor has beenunflagging, and their tolerance of my moods and preoccupations has been morethan I have any right to expect. I thank them for generously giving me thespace, and time, that writing this book has demanded, and for asking for solittle in return. Beyond that, both have contributed to the outcome by readingthe manuscript as it has taken form with careful and critical eyes, alwaysmaking astute suggestions for edits and improvements. Likewise, I want toacknowledge Terence’s family: his ex-wife Kat Harrison, son Finn, and daughterKlea. Their honest feedback and suggestions have made this a better book than itwould have been without their valued input. Other members of my family have alsobeen generous in sharing their time, memories, and family treasures, especiallyold photographs and documents. Memory is such an ephemeral and fragile thing, asI have learned, and their help has been invaluable in my attempts to reconstructthe specifics of names and places, dates and events, of a misty past that is nowa bit less so, thanks to them.In particular, I want to thank my beloved Aunt Tress, my mother’s youngestsister, for those wonderful interviews at her kitchen table in the summer of2011. I learned so much that I had never known, and it gave me a chance to renewbonds with a favorite aunt that I will always cherish. My other favorite, mydear Aunt Mayme, Mom’s other younger sister, passed away at age ninety-sevenwhile this book was in progress., and I will always love her and remember allthat she did for Mom and “the boys” during our long and problematic childhood.I’m so sorry that she did not live to see the outcome of this work; but she hasbeen an inspiration for it nonetheless, and I am grateful to her. I also want tothank her daughters, Judy and Jody, and Judy’s husband, Laddie, for the richconversations we had in the course of my research, and for the photos anddocuments that helped me reconstruct the backstory to my account. I thank themalso for their hospitality and for always extending a warm welcome to thiswayward traveler on my rare visits back to the old hometown. They are the oneswho have made this story real, by providing me with a window to the past, and aconnection to the family clan that is very much a part of the present and futureas well as the past. They remind me that I do have a family on my mother’s side,quite an extensive one, and I am proud to be a part of it.On my father’s side of the family, I want to thank and acknowledge my Uncle Aut(Austin), or “Mack” as he’s now known, and his wife, Fran. They are my livingconnection to our father’s family, and all the more beloved and cherishedbecause of that. Aut freely shared his time, recollections, documents, andphotos, and helped me to reconstruct our father’s childhood, the life that heshared with his brothers and sister and our paternal grandparents. He alsopainted a vivid picture of our parents’ lives before and after World War II, areminder that they were all young once, too, and led rich, full lives longbefore “Terry and Denny” were anywhere to be seen. Of course, I must acknowledgeour parents, Joe and “Hadie” (Hazelle) McKenna, to whom this book is dedicated.They have both been gone for many years now, but I cherish their memory andthank them for providing Terence and me with a loving home and an environmentthat allowed us to flourish. We gave them fits, more than any parent should haveto tolerate, and yet they loved us through it all. It took many years before Ifully came to appreciate what extraordinary people they were.I also want to acknowledge those old friends who knew Terence and me back in theday, and who were kind enough to share their reminiscences. Some are mentionedunder pseudonyms in the book, a small gesture to preserve their privacy, but youknow who you are. You were there from the early days, and we lived through somecrazy times together. Thank you for sharing your stories and more. I amespecially grateful to Sara Hartley for kindly allowing the use of herphotographs. Thanks also to Terence’s good friend William Patrick Watson forpermission to reprint his “shamanic talismanic” poem “Pursuing to Peru theG’nostic Guru” as an appendix to this book. It was the perfect incantation forour quixotic quest then, and it remains so to this day. Thanks also to JillWagner for sharing her recollections.Wade Davis was generous with his valuable time in providing an interview for myKickstarter project, and also shared his wisdom and experience in the publishingrealm with me. I owe him thanks for much, but most importantly for hisfriendship through the years.My friend George Douvris also deserves a sincere thanks for providing aninterview for the site, and for his enthusiastic support in getting word of theproject out to the community of fellow travelers.I want to give special acknowledgement to those who engineered the “nuts andbolts” of this book. My editor, Jeremiah Creedon, long-suffering, gifted,insightful, brilliant, deserves far more credit than me for sculpting myunwieldy prose into something we’re ready to show to the world. I had no ideawhen I started out how important it would be to have a good editor covering forme; Jerry has been there for me every step of the way. I want to give a specialthanks to Mark Odegard, my best friend in Minnesota. He introduced me to Jerry,and he has applied his considerable skills to designing the layout, the cover,and jacket for this book. Thanks to Mark, this book is a thing of beauty fromits cover to the final page. I also owe Mark for urging me to undertake thisproject in the first place; he pressed me for years, and I finally gave in, andhe was always there with an encouraging word. Another close friend, Mac Graham,has given freely of his time and skills as a copy editor and proofreader; manythanks to him for his generous contribution to the process. Thanks are also dueto Tom Healy and Mary Ricci for their copyediting and proofing as the finallayout took form. Tom and Mary brought their sharp minds and eyes to the task atjust the right moment.I am entirely responsible for any errors in this account, and any inaccuraciesin my recollections of people and events, and I’m sure there are a few andperhaps more than a few. I humbly accept any blame that is due and apologize tomy readers.I want to thank Dan Levy, Terence’s former editor, for his suggestion that I tryusing Kickstarter to secure the funds and time to create this book. It seemedlike a crazy idea when we discussed it in December 2010, but it worked betterthan either of us could have imagined. It was a brilliant idea. I want to thankSeal Dwyer and her team at North Star Press of St. Cloud for handling theproduction and printing of this book as well as providing invaluable guidance increating the e-book versions. With their help, and Kickstarter’s, we’ve createda new model for self-publishing that I hope will be an inspiration to others. Wealso want to extend a special thanks to our friend Keith Cleaversly, anenthusiastic supporter of this project who didn’t hesitate to step into thebreach at a most critical juncture. For all that you do and are, Keith, manythanks. The project could not have succeeded without you.Finally, I want to thank my loyal and patient Kickstarter supporters. Thanks toyou, this book exists. I don’t know how it could have happened otherwise. Thanksto you, I discovered that Terence and I are both loved by a vast community offine, compassionate people who identified with our story, and who stepped in tomake it possible to tell it to the wider world. As I promised, the names ofthose who contributed at the “patron” level are listed below. To all whocontributed, I offer my profound gratitude. I humbly offer all of you the fruitof our labors and hope that you will find it worthy.

"},{"pageContent":"Appendix This poem was written by William Patrick Watson, one of Terence’s oldest andbest friends from his high school years in Los Altos and later in Berkeley. Thedate of its composition is not completely clear even in the recollection of theauthor. What we do know is that it was written at least a year before ourdeparture for La Chorrera, sometime in late 1969 or early 1970. In ourdiscussions of a possible South American adventure at the time, we assumed wewould be headed to Peru. Later, we changed our plans in favor of traveling to LaChorrera to seek the fabled oo-koo-hé. The poem has not been previouslypublished.Dennis McKenna Pursuing To Peru The G’nostic Guru: A Poetic TalismanFor T. McKenna, Irish Shaman By W. Watson, Unauthorized Bard Pursuing to PeruThe g’nostic guruWho doesn’t come to youOut of sunyatic blue. Questing the star shamanHidden in the binduOf hyperstellar semenWhose lore you thought you knew. In vine-shrouded jungleDo not your mantras bungleLest a god-plant eat youAnd into void excrete you. On peaks both bleak and eerieOf two-faced gods be leeryEspecially if they’re hairyOf them be most be-wary. Beware the Incan tangleAnd saucer siren jangleWhich may your body dangleFrom ridge-pole all amangle. And dye your beard an umberOr better, put it underA green hindu bandana,Lest a wild head hunterMake of it a bannerFor his jungle manor.(I know that wouldn’t please youSo please of these hints heed you.) By shores of TiticacaSmoke the silver hookahErect your star antennaBroadcast the name McKennaIn acrostics KabbalisticAnd pun it in MandaeanThen surely crypto-mystic Will come the alchemic lion.The demons are of many kindsSome made of ions, some of mindThe ones of DMT you’ll findStutter often and are blind. While swimming toward galactic islesWatch out for stellar crocodiles;They have the most enticing smilesBut nonetheless are full of wiles.If you be transmogrifiedTo tiny monads side by side(of a millimeter wide)by spiderweb together tied,Recite the’ Tibetan mantra phatWhich instantly will make you fat;Tho sitting on Benares ghat,At least you’ll know the place you’re at.(You might in transit lose your hatBut mantras can’t account for that.) If you encounter scorpionsWhile making transgalactic runs,Remember they’re immune to punsBut shrivel if near onions.(By all means you should carry oneUnless you have a garlic gun.The latter is of effective useIn dealing with the gnostic gooseWho often aeons let run looseTo snatch the shaman seeking nous.) If you meet a tree toadAt a forking of the road,Inquire of him yage’s abodeBut if he doesn’t speak your mode,Do not goad the tree toad,Lest he should explodeEach ganglionic nodeOf what you thought you knowed.Of the moonherb SomaThat puts you into comaAnd alters every chromosome(Disguising you for journey home)Just say the mantra OM AHAnd instantly you’ll start to foamWith elixer of ChandraChurned from the lunar chakra(Watch for the evil raksha!)And thru the star clouds freely roam,But if you should begin to come(to hide the seed we are agreed)Then say the quelling mantra HUM;(this may attract the cosmic beesWho drone with Proustian reveries,Drowning you with memories;To counteract, it’s best to sneeze).Of sodomic witch doctorsWho hang heads on their doorsBeware their brew of sporesThey’ll rub into your pores. But witches resembling KaliWho offer you an allyAre oftentimes quite lovely,On them you’d best rely. If you find at landing rampThe lake resembles summer campWith every kind of psychic vampSunning beneath a solar lamp,And gaudy-dressed and rosy queersWho greet you with their shoutsand cheers,Embracing you with smiles and tearsWhile whispering mantras in your ears;By no means should you be perplexedOr any wise outraged or vexedTo find yourself transformed of sex,(such happenstance you must expect.) If in dire need you should beSend an express wire to meVia telepathic telegraphyAnd I’ll cable spells to set you free. Or if you need a helping handSwallow thirteen grains of sandRaise aloft your crystal wandAnd send coordinates whereon to land. I’ll quickly zip into my shipAnd unto Titicaca tripAnd track you down by radar blipAnd from the hands of demons ripYou, ere they can you much molest,And I’ll take you to an isle of rest(Your body and your mind distressedif you should falter in your quest). But let me say your journey’s blestAnd if you follow these words behestThen surely in a star you’ll nestOr be made of DMT at best "},{"pageContent":"About the Author Dennis McKenna is an ethnopharmacologist who has studied plant hallucinogens forover forty years.
