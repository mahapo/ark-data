These pronouncements were breathless, pious, embarrassingly grandiose. But they did lurch in the right direction. The inevitable future. The '60s Youth Movement did change human culture. It did, among other things, popularize-legitimize this astonishing concept of \"New Generation\" as a major cultural issue. Globally. GENERATIONALISMO! It is hard for us to realize that this concept that each generation of Teen- Agers Re-Creates a New Culture was not a major historical force before the 20th Century. For example, in the slow-witted 1975 edition of \"The New (?) Columbia Encyclopedia\" the only reference to this explosive word refers to the \"Generation of 1898\", in Spain! ThE GAY '90s BOHEMIANS WH$ NOJ TEENERS My charming, elegant, educated, worldly, Irish-Catholic grandparents, Sarah Rooney S Dennis Leary, did not imagine that they belonged to a \"generation\". Dutiful Catholic teen-agers of the Victorian Age, 1860-1890, danced, dressed, courted the way their parents (and the Protestants) did. Polka* & Waltzed! And their coming-of-age trips were not to Woodstock or Katmandu. Like the Protestants they read about in the papers, they dutifully sailed to Europe on the traditional Cunard steamships and made the classical, obligatory \"trips\" to the Louvre, the Vatican Museums and the Opera Houses. THE LOST GENERATION OF THE '20s Just recently I learned that my sophisticated Aunt Betty died in 1923 of a cocaine overdose! Betty in her scandalous trips to Paris, New York and Reno (for a semi-legal divorce) was a \"hell-raising\", \"whoopee\", sophisticated \"flapper\".

My darling, beloved parents, Abigail S Timothy, were part of this new culture. These pious, prudish, patriotic, middle-class Catholics openly swigged the major illegal drug of the time! And they smoked cigarettes (not in public, for ladies, of course). Abby and Tote belonged to the first cohort to understand generational differ- ences. They called it \"progress\", i.e. Model T Fords, canned goods, lip-stickO). My parents (silently) knew they were different from their parents. They were the first generation in human history to listen to radio and talk via electric wires. They smoked and drank like the film stars. Their Radio Broadcasts were lec- tures or symphony concerts. They were \"teened\" too soon to be imprinted by Decca Records playing Jazz and Dixieland. Television? No way! My parents stubbornly rejected TV like suspicious primi- tives.

Foster Damon, could remember his sudden vision of tiny flowers carpeting Harvard Yard violet before World War One, an image that lingered over 60 years in mind since his fellow student Virgil Thomson gave him the cactus peyote to eat. Damon concluded that rare beings like Blake are born with physiologic gift of vision, continuous or intermittent. William James, whose pragmatic magic probably called the Peyote God to Harvard in the first place, had included shamanistic chemical visions among the many authentic \"Varieties of Religious Experience.\" His student Gertrude Stein experimented in alteration of consciousness through mindfulness of language, an extremely effective Yoga since mechanical reproduction of language by XX Century had made language the dominant vehicle of civilized consciousness; her companion Alice B. Toklas contributed a cookbook recipe for Hashish Brownies to enlighten those persons over-talkative in drawing rooms unaware that \"the medium is the message.\" This synchronism is exquisite: William S. Burroughs also once of Harvard shared Miss Stein's mindfulness of the hypnotic drug-like power of language, and collaborated on cut-up rearrange- ment of stereotyped language forms with friend Brion Gysin, who had originally given Miss Toklas the recipe for her famous Brownies. Burroughs among others had begun experiments with drug- shamanism after World War Two for the author of \"Naked Lunch\" it was a pragmatic extension of his Cambridge interest in linguistic Anthropology.

For as Plato had writ, \"When the mode of the music changes, the walls of the city shake.\" The new consciousness born in these States can be traced back through old gnostic texts, visions, artists, 8 shamans; it is the consciousness of our ground nature suppressed 8 desecrated. It was always the secret tale of the tribe in America, this great scandal of the closing of the doors of perception of the Naked Human Form Divine. It began with the white murder of Indian inhabitants of the ground, the theft and later usurious exploitation of their land, it continued with an assault on all races and species of Mother Nature herself and concludes today with total disruption of the ecology of the entire planet. No wonder black slaves kept for non-human use into this century in tear-gassed ghettos of megalopolis were the first Aliens to sound the horn of Change, the first Strangers to Call the Great Call through Basilides' many Heavens. Amazing synchronism again, that Mr. Frank Takes Gun, Native American Church amerindian Peyote Chief, invited the brilliantly talk- ative silver-haired psychiatrist who directed a Saskatchewan mental hospital in the 1940's to partic- ipate in a Peyote ritual, and that same Dr. Humphrey Osmond having recognized a wonder of con- sciousness thus experienced passed on the catalyst in Mescaline synthetic form to Aldous Huxley; and that Huxley's 1945 essay on the chemical opening of the Doors of Perception found its way to the tables of Bickford's Cafeteria Times Square New York 8 the couches of Reed College and Berkeley, where artist persons, having heard the Great Call of the African American, already initiat- ed themselves en masse to subtle gradations of their own consciousness experienced while smok- ing the same Afric hemp smoked by Charles Parker Thelonious Monk 8 Dizzy Gillespie. Dr. Timothy Leary takes up his part of the tale of the tribe in a Mexican hut and brings his discovery to Harvard harmoniously and there begins the political battle, black and white magic become public visible for a generation. Dr. Leary is a hero of American consciousness. He began as a sophisticated academician, he encountered discoveries in his field which confounded him and his own technology, he pursued his studies where attention commanded, he arrived beyond the boundaries of public knowledge. One might hesitate to say, like Socrates, like Galileo? poor Dr."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Foreword xix Leary, poor Earth! Yet here we are in Science Fiction History, in the age of Hydrogen Bomb Apocalypse, the very Kali Yuga wherein man's stupidity so overwhelms the planet that ecological catastrophe begins to rehearse old tribes-tales of Karmaic retribution, Fire 8 Flood 8 Armageddon impending. It would be natural (in fact deja vu) that the very technology stereotyping our consciousness 8 desensitizing our perceptions should throw up its own antidote, an antidote synthetic such as LSD synchronous with mythic tribal Soma 8 Peyote. Given such historic Comedy, who could emerge form Harvard technology but one and only Dr. Leary, a respectable human being, a worldly man faced with the task of Messiah. Inevitable! Not merely because the whole field of mental psycholo- gy as a \"science\" had arrived at biochemistry anyway. It was inevitable because the whole profes- sional civilized world, like Dr. Leary, was already faced with the Messianic task of accelerated evo- lution (i.e., psychosocial Revolution) including an alteration of human consciousness leading to the immediate mutation of social 8 economic forms. This staggering realization, psychedelic, i.e., con- scious expanding 8 mind-manifesting in itself, without the use of chemical catalysts, was then forced on all of us by images of our own unconscious rising from the streets of Chicago, where city tear gas was dumped on Christ's very Cross in Lincoln Park AD 1968. The drains are backing up in the cities, smog noise and physiologic poison in food turn us to insect acts, overpopulation crazes the planet, our lakes corrupt, old riverways become dark fens, tanks entered Prague and Chicago streets simultaneous, Police State arrives in every major city, starvation wastes African provinces, Chinese genocide in Tibet mirrored American genocide in Vietnam, Alarm! Alarm! howls deep as any Biblic prophecy. Ourselves caught in the giant machine are conditioned to its terms, only holy vision or tech- nological catastrophe or revolution break \"the mind-forg'd manacles.\" Given one by-product of the technology that might, as it were by feed-back, correct the berserk machine and liberate the inven- tor's mind from captivity by hypnotic robots, Dr. Leary had in LSD an invaluable civilized elixir. For, as Dr. Jiri Roubichek observed early in Prague (\"Artificial Psychosis,\" 1958), \"LSD inhibits condi- tioned reflexes.\" And this single phrase, for rational men, might be the key to the whole gnostic mystery of LSD and Dr. Leary's role as unique, alas solitary, courageous, humane 8 frank Democratic Boddhisatva-teacher of the uses of LSD in America. For he took on himself the noble task of announcing the evidence of his senses despite the scary contumely of fellow academicians, the dispraising timorous irony of scientific \"professionals,\" the stupidity meanness self-serving cowardice and hollow vanity of bureaucratic personnel from Harvard Yard to Mexico City to Washington, from the violent-mouthed burglar-Prosecutor G.

Dr. Leary conducted himself fairly 8 equitably, given the extremity of his knowledge, it took an innocent courage to explore his own unconditioned consciousness, to take LSD and other chem- icals often enough to balance praxis as well as explanation, and to attempt to wed the enormity of his experience to Reason. An heroic attempt to communicate clearly and openly through civilized technologic media to his fellow citizens, despite centuries of identity brainwash accelerated now to mass paranoia and Cold War Apocalypse, required of Dr. Leary the proverbial wisdom of serpent 8 harmlessness of dove. Timothy Leary tells the tale of his tribe in book aptly titled The Politic* 01 Ccttaty, 8 events enlarged since he wrote his book and chose its title charge the author's handiwork with prophetic enormity. The battle of generations that erupted in 1968 simultaneously in Prague, Chicago, Mexico City, Paris, New York (and Moscow underground)-everywhere the State's electronic consciousness was interlinked-transcended antique battles of Cold War and Race. We witnessed planetary con- frontation wherein controlling Elders trapped in a suicidal mechanical consciousness deployed their destructive technology against their own children in the streets of their own cities. 'Tis Blake's Urizen tormenting tender Los in Eternity! New generations have risen spontaneous with new consciousness and a mutant politics of flower power that is rooted in the ground of human consciousness itself: an acceptance of human identity as one with green living nature on a living planet where all creatures are a living God. The public philosophies and technologies of all civi- lized Governments at present are at war with this God, and the planet itself is within decades of destruction. No wonder there was sudden appearance of Adamic hair. Eve walked naked in the streets; ancient body-rhythms beat out thru the airwaves in electric mantric Rock from Bratislava to San Francisco, 8 youths ingested shamanistic elixirs to recover consciousness of planetary arche- types. One politic synchronism that concerns this text should be gossiped forth contextual. Timothy Leary quit public life to write a book in Mexico some years ago but he was searched by Agents of Government as he went to cross borders, arrested for possession of some herb, and thus forced to interrupt his writing, returned to public action, and defend his person by attack from by the State. So he traveled to academies and lectured to the young, 8 thus he paid large legal fees required by the State 8 thus maintained an Ashram of fellow seekers well known in Millbrook. Agents of Government then raided and repeatedly abused the Millbrook Utopia, whereupon Dr. Leary was obliged to be Dr. Leary and lecture more to raise money for his family of imprisoned friends."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Foreword xxi Agents of Government concluded this phase of prosecution with a piece of Socratic irony so bla- tantly echoing an old Greek injustice that the vulgar rhetoric of a Tyrannous State would need only be quoted to be recognized, were it not for the fact that these States were then so plagued with Tyrannously inspired chaos and public communication so flooded with images of State Atrocity from the alleys of Saigon to the parks of Chicago that official public conscience here now, as memorably in Russia and Germany, was shocked, dumbed S amnesiac.

Federal authorities chose to retry Dr. Leary on his Laredo arrest on another technicality, this time not for failure to report natural grass for govern- ment tax, but on the charge of \"transporting\" a smidgeon of marijuana the few hundred yards from the middle of the International Bridge to the Customs Shed where he had been detained years ear- lier. Convicted in Texas trial, our philosopher was sentenced by Judge Ben Connally to ten years also; both sentences set consecutively, bail denied, Dr. Leary at time of this writing was jailed in California from February 19, 1970.

The guides numbered around 40. There were faculty members S graduate stu- dents from the Psychology and Divinity departments. There were, also, a dozen or so distinguished visiting advisors including Allen Ginsberg, Aldous Huxley, Alan Watts, William Burroughs, Marshall McLuhan, Charles Mingus, Arthur Koestler, etc. The Harvard Psychedelic Center functioned as a global clearing house for information about self-administered brain-change drugs. Please do not be put off by the ironic title (Priest?) which was suggested by a certain, late-night prankster, Paul Krassner. First let's discuss the playing rules which guided these explorations. The project personalized, humanized, psychologized the basic playing-princi- ples of the new Quantum Psychology: Einsteinian Relativity, Heisenberg Determinacy, Planckian Chaotics, McLuhan Linguistics. 1. Einsteinian Relativity... ...when applied to human behavior, becomes Interpersonal Interactivity. Continual feedback of changing viewpoints. The traditional role of impersonal (Newtonian) scientists setting up experi- ments and measuring the behavior of animal-or-human subjects was outmoded. The new emphasis on Interpersonal Relations and Field Theory was marketed (in various American-British Research Centers ) as Social Psychology, Group Counseling, Gestalt Analysis, Feedback Techniques, Client-Centered Counseling, 12-Step Programs. Hands-On , D.I.Y. (Do It Yourself) methods. Patients and therapists formed teams to study the here-now experiences. The Staff acted as coaches, tour guides. The Patients-Subjects were the stars. Our staff did not administer drugs to the subjects. Typically, one or more staff members (guides) would be selected, by lot, to trip with the subjects. We tried to be Interpersonal not Impersonal."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"xxvi High Rriest Timothy Leary The deal was common-sense-fair-play. We provided Brain-Activating drugs. And we provided books 8 reports from other trippers. Both guides and tourists planned the Setting and mutually defined the Set, i.e. the goals. Divinity students wanted to have mystical experiences. Prisoners wanted to learn why they messed-up. (Well, in candor, it must be said that most prisoners were happy about getting \"high in the slammer\". They agreed to write reports and fill out score-Boards (questionnaires) about their experiences. The Harvard guides agreed to do the same. This was our main-street understanding of Einstein's Inter- Active, Feed-Back theories. The trips in this book included legendary intellectuals: Aldous Huxley, William Burroughs, Gordon Wasson, Walter Clark, Arthur Koestler, Charles Mingus, Maynard and Flora Lou Ferguson, Frank Barron, Ralph Metzner, Allen Ginsberg, Charles Olson. Less renowned, but equally enlightening, were a sophisticated Black Junkie, a witty British adventurer, a Hip Hindu Lady Guru, a real tough Boston-Mafia mur- derer. And three courageous Christian Theologians. My children, Susan and Jack, acted as guides and observers. 2. Heisenberq Determinacy Observers create the realities they inhabit. Viewpoints. Perspectives. The set- ting for each excursion was planned by the trippers. Each voyager returns with different stories to tell. The aim is to take responsi- bility for, and notes about the realities you determine. 3. Planckian Chaotics: The basic nature of the universe, we are told, is indescribable chaotics. Ultra- Complexities which boggle the word-processing mind. Psychedelic drugs apparently activate \"right\" brain circuits which overwhelm, unfocus, dilate, disorder the linear \"left\" brain-mind. (The words \"left\" and \"right\" are metaphorical and not anatomically precise.) Practically, this means you have to dilate your pupils to become a visionary.

Consider the poetic, lyric, eye-balling words for great moments: head-lights, high-lights, lime-lights, spot-lights, brightness, brilliance, flame, radiating scintilla- tion. Sadly, we realized that books like High priest could produce only squiggly black letters on white paper; words just package-labels for the neuro-retinal events within. We pioneer researchers did try to enlighten our reports. In the early '60s we studied how great religions have used light to dazzle eyes and imprint vulnerable brains of the faithful. Stained glass windows. Candles. Reflecting jewels. Gregorian chants. Bells. So we developed \"light-shows\". They were primitive affairs. Light reflected through bowls of colored jello. Eight slide-projectors producing layers of multi-col- ored swirling images. Three or four sound tracks scrambling ear balls.

Today, of course, we are beginning to use neurological and digital terms to suggest how we can operate our brains. But in 1962 there was no language in American Psychology for these experi- ences.

In this turn on was life; and the life was the light of men. It has always been the same. It was the flash that exploded the galaxies, from which all energy flows. It was the spark that ignites in the mysterious welding of amino-acid strands that creates the humming vine of organic life. It is the brilliant neurological glare that illuminates the shadows of man's mind. The God-intoxicated reve- lation. The Divine union.

In the fall of 1952 we learned that the 16th cen- tury writers, describing the Indian cultures of Mexico, had recorded that certain mushrooms played a divine role in the religion of the natives. The so-called mushroom stones really represented mushrooms, and that they were the symbol of a reli- gion, like the cross in the Christian religion or the star of Judea or the crescent of the Moslems. I was first drugged out of my mind in Cuernavaca, August i960. I ate seven of the Sacred Mushrooms of Mexico and discovered that beauty, revelation, sensuality, the cellular history of the past, God, the Devil all lie inside my body, outside my mind. In the days of Montezuma this town called horn- of-the-cow was the center of soothsayers, wise-men, and magicians. Cuernavaca is the southern anchor point of a line running from the fabled volcanic peaks Popo and Iztaccihuatl over to the volcano of Toluca. On the high slopes of the volcanoes, east and west of the capital, grow the Sacred Mushrooms of Mexico, divinatory fungi, Teonanacatl, flesh of the Gods. In the summer of i960 Cuernavaca was the site of considerable activity by American psychologists soothsayers, medicine men, would-be magicians from the North vacationing on research grants and working in the lush valley of Morelos in sight of the snowy peaks of the legendary volcanoes. Erich Fromm was running an experimental proj- ect down the highway, studying the social and emo- tional currents of Indian village life. Over in Tepoztlan, ten miles to the east, Professor David McClelland, on vacation from Harvard, was working on plans to help underdeveloped countries raise their economic standards through psychologi- cal techniques and the Protestant ethic. His statis- tics showed that Catholic, Moslem, Buddhist coun- tries were poor. Elliot Danzig, Mexico's leading industrial psy- chologist, was a few cornfields away in his villa which sits next to the cliff under the altar of the God Tepozteco. It was at this altar, often shrouded in rain clouds, that the Aztecs had worshipped the God, Tepozteco, to drumrolls of the arousing 12"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"August 1960 00 13 thunder and bolts of lightning, the clinging flame. It was he who showered down blessings including the gift of pulque ... a milky beer fermented from cactus, which contains its own abundance of thunder over the earth. In Cuernavaca another villa served as summer headquarters for four American psychologists- Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert of Harvard, Frank Barron of California, and Richard Dettering of San Francisco. Thus we find a mushroom in the center of the cult with perhaps the longest continuous history in the world. The happenings of that summer in quiet Cuerna- vaca were to set up reverberations which have echoed now for years. Many of the scientists who were working and vacationing there that season have had their lives dramatically changed, and none of them will ever completely escape from the myste- rious power, the challenge, the paradox of what started to unfold. I was working on a book about the philosophy of the behavioral sciences. I was dissatisfied with the theory and methods of psychology and trying to develop an existential-transactional approach to the study of human events. Existential means you study natural events as they unfold without prejudging them with your own concepts. You surrender your mind to the events. Transactional means you see the research situa- tion as a social network, of which the experimenter is one part. The psychologist doesn't stand outside the event, but recognizes his part in it, and works collaboratively with the subject towards mutually selected goals. This philosophic position, when applied, gener- ates a lot of emotion. For one thing, it bypasses the traditional experimenter-subject and doctor-patient relationships.

An indiscriminate, unsupervised, un- controlled two-billion-year-old energy dance with ecstatic communion as the goal. Thus we are all divided into two classes: those who have taken the mushroom and are disqualified by our subjective experience and those who have not taken the mushroom and are dis- qualified by their total ig- norance of the subject. I am profoundly grateful to my Indian friends for having initiated me into the tre- mendous mystery of the mushroom. Of alcohol they speak with the same jocular vulgarity that we do. But about mush- rooms they prefer not to speak at all, at least when they are in company and especially when strangers, white strangers, are pres- ent.

( I Ching XVI ) The villa in Cuernavaca, which became the back- drop for my mushroom revelations, needs to be described. The setting, the surrounding, is a key factor in the outcome of any visionary voyage whether you use mushrooms or marijuana or LSD or rosary beads, and in this regard the Cuernavaca mushroom eaters were fortunate. The Spanish-style villa was out on the Acapulco road near the golf course. It was a rambling white stucco house with scarlet trim, surrounded by gray stone walls. The walls were pierced by two red-iron scroll gates and there was a long veranda and a wide staircase leading down to a carriage drive. Down below was a sloping lawn ringed by flowers. Two rows of red urns flanked the stairs. The villa had been built by Mexican Moslems and remodeled by Mexican Viennese. It was colorful, open, and lush. Next to the upper terrace was the swimming pool, lake blue, and the lawn fell away downslope to a lower green terraced lawn. The close-cropped turf was thick rough Cuernavaca grass, good to look at but matting into heavy piled green carpet, scraping your bare feet and leaving tattooed welts on your back after you lay on it."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"August 1960 00 15 The lower lawn was shaded by lacy Ahuehuate trees, and on the walls of the villa, vines, green, splashed with red, yellow, orange, and the clear blue of the mile-high Morelos sky and the lush green of the golf course fairway down below the wall.

A frequent visitor was Gerhart Braun, anthropol- ogist-historian-linguist from the University of Mex- ico. With him would come Joan, his girl friend, and Betty, an English major from the University of California, who wrote poetry and cracked jokes and played touch football with the kids. Gerhart had been studying the Aztec culture and translating old texts written in Nahuatl, the lan- guage used by the Aztecs before the conquest. He had discovered repeated references to the use of Sacred Mushrooms by Aztec soothsayers on cere- monial occasions to predict the future, to feel better, to solve mental problems. On the eve of the Emperor's coronation Mexico City got high on mushrooms. But the Spanish his- torians, most of them priests, rarely mentioned the magic mushrooms. And when they did it was in prudish, frightened terms. Evil! Danger! Fear! Then, when evening and darkness come and you are alone with a wise old man or woman whose confi- dence you have won, by the light of a candle held in the hand and talking in a whisper, you may bring up the subject. They are never exposed in the marketplace but pass from hand to hand by pre- arrangement. The Aztecs before the Spanish arrived called them Teonanacatl, God's flesh. I need hardly remind you of a disquieting para' lei, the designation of the elements in our Eucharist: \"Take, eat, this is my body . . .\", and again, \"Grant us therefore, gra- cious Lord, so to eat the flesh of Thy dear son. . . .\""},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"16 00 God Reveals Himself The orthodox Christian must accept by faith the miracle of the conversion of the bread into God's flesh: That is what is meant by the Doctrine of Transub- stantiation. By contrast, the mushroom of the Aztecs carries its own conviction; every com- municant will testify to the miracle that he has experi- enced. In the language of the Mazatecs the sacred mush- rooms are called 'nti si tho. The first word, 'nti, is a par- ticle expressing reverence and endearment. The sec- ond element means \"that which springs forth.\" Gerhart's curiosity was aroused and he had asked around about the mushrooms and discovered that they grew on the volcanic slopes near Mexico City. So one day we drove up to the village of San Pedro near the volcano of Toluca and walked around the marketplace asking about the Sacred Mushrooms. Bruce Conner came with us shooting movies, dancing around filming the sides of meat hanging in the butcher shops and the swarms of black flies and the piles of fruit, the sidewalk dis- plays of cloth woven in red and yellow seed and cell designs. There was much thoughtful shaking of heads by the shopkeepers when the mushrooms were men- tionedand conversation in low Spanish in the back rooms. Old Juana was the one to see. Where did one find Juana? She would come to the market. Wait right here under the arch. She'll come soon. We stood there for an hour while the sandaled market-day crowds padded by. An old woman, backbent, gray stringy hair, black shawl, eyes down, creaking stiffly, Senora Juana. She brushed by us, not responding to our hail, not stopping or looking up at us. She passed through the market street and turned at the corner and walked away from the village. We followed along the rutted dirt road, and on the outskirts of town Gerhart walked faster and caught up with Juana. She stopped and they began to talk. We stood back and waited and watched. Juana seemed to be listening, then she looked up at Gerhart, nodded her head, pointed up to the moun- tain, turned, pointed back to the town, and then started off down the road. Gerhart returned to us smiling. Okay. It's all set. She'll get the mushrooms next Wednesday and I'll meet her in the marketplace next Thursday. The following Thursday Gerhart phoned from Mexico City. Excited. He had met Juana in the market. They had gone away from the tumult of the market to the shade of a church wall. He asked her if she was sure they were safe. She popped two of them in her mouth before his eyes. He washed them in cold water, and they are resting now on the center shelf of his refrigerator. See you Saturday."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"August 1960 00 17 Saturday, the day of visions, dawned sunny and clear. Around noon Gerhart and his group arrived from Mexico City. Joan and Betty the poet. I met them on the lawn and the group stood in a welcoming circle. My son Jack's iguana, a four- foot dinosaur, crawled up and lay on his belly, blinking his black ancient ebony eyes, and everyone stooped to inspect the long blunt snout, the pat- terned design of his canvas skin, our old friend who crawled up from the crevice of our planet's history and breathed slowly and flicked his lids and watched us live and die. They said he was a hun- dred years old. The maid was surprised when we walked into the kitchen to wash the hongos and she was even more surprised to learn that we weren't planning to cook them. Crudos? Her dark eyes narrowed. Then the resigned shrug. Americans are eccentric. Gerhart had talked with the University botanists and had researched the field thoroughly. So while he supervised the cleaning he started to lecture on the mushrooms. Known and used by the Aztecs. Banned by the Catholic church. Said by leading botanists not even to exist! The trance-giving mush- rooms. Pushed out of history's notice until the last decade when they had been discovered by Weit- linger and Schultes and the American mycologists, Valentina and Gordon Wasson. Pause to clear throat. By now they had been eaten by a few scientists, a few poets, a few intellectuals looking for mystical experiences. They produced wondrous trances. Oh yeah? What does he mean by that? There were two kinds, females and males. The lady mushrooms were the familiar umbrella shape, but black, ominous, bitter-looking. The male's anat- omy was so phallic there was no need to ask why they were called males. Wondrous trances. The words meant nothing. We moved out to the pool. The mushrooms were in two large bowls, male and female separate, on the table under the huge beach umbrella. Gerhart was still lecturing, now about the dosage. Six females and six males. The effect should begin after an hour. Then he stuffed a big, black, moldy-damp mushroom in his mouth and made a face and chewed and I watched his \"The little mushroom comes of itself, no one knows whence, like the wind that comes we know not whence nor why.\" For more than four cen- turies the Indians have kept the divine mushroom close to their hearts, sheltered from desecration by white men, a precious secret. We know that today there are many curanderos who carry on the cult, each ac- cording to his lights, some of them consummate artists, performing the ancient liturgy in remote huts be- fore minuscule congrega- tions. They are hard to reach, these curanderos. Do not think that it is question of money."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"18 00 God Reveals Himself Perhaps you will learn the names of a number of re- nowned curanderos, and your emissaries will even promise to deliver them to you, but then you wait and wait and they never come. You will brush past them in the marketplace, they will know you, but you will not know them. The judge in the town hall may be the very man you are seeking: And you may pass the *ime of day with him, yet jver learn that he is your curandero. After all, would you have it any different? What priest of the Catholic Church will perform mass to satisfy an unbeliever's curiosity? Adam's apple bounce as it went down. Gerhart was voyager number one. I picked one up. It stank of forest damp and crumbling logs and New England basement. Are you sure they are not poisonous? Gerhart shrugged. That's what I asked the old witch and she swore that they were okay and she popped a few in her mouth to demonstrate. I looked around. Joan, following Gerhart's exam- ple, was munching somewhat unhappily. She was explorer number two. Mandy, my girl friend, was miserably chewing. She was number three. Dick Dettering was looking down so that the loose pouches under his eyes sagged. Well, Dicko? He gave a fierce scared look and began to nibble at his palm with squirrelly movement. He was number four. I went next. They tasted worse than they looked. Bitter, stringy. Filthy. I took a slug of Carta Blanca and jammed the rest in my mouth and washed them down. Number five. Poet Betty standing by the edge of the terrace was suddenly vomiting black strings in the bushes. Then she ate more. She was number six. Gerhart was telling us that the males had no effect and served only a ceremonial function. Every- one was listening to his own stomach expecting to be poisoned. Quite a picture, six of us sitting around on the sunlit terrace in our bathing suits waiting, waiting: asking each other, how many did you take? Males or females? Do you feel anything? Two people fasted. Ruth Dettering was eager to eat but she was pregnant and Dick scolded her with froggy harumphs until she agreed to wait. She had been a nurse and I was glad t T at she was going to be out of trance. I talked to her about how to call for an ambulance and stomach pumps. And Whiskers fasted. Whiskers was a friend of a friend and had arrived the night before. He was slight in build, sweet in demeanor a sensitive logician just flunked out of Michigan, clipping his words, hesitant, pedantic, anxious about sending a cable to his mother.

He was sitting next to Gerhart and was dressed in bathing trunks over flowered undershorts, and green garters and black socks and leather shoes and a silken robe. He had been appointed scientist and was taking elaborate notes of Gerhart's reactions. Religion in primitive society was an awesome reality, \"terrible\" in the original meaning of the word, per- vading all life and culmi- nating in ceremonies that were forbidden to the pro- fane.

Within minutes, he recalled later, he felt himself \"be- ing swept over the edge of a sensory Niagara into a maelstrom of transcen- dental visions and halluci- nations.\" The fungi were legendary \"sacred mushrooms\" that have since become known and feared by many, as one of the psychedelic (literally, mind-manifesting) chemi- cals that have created a na- tional fad among the na- tion's young and a scandal in the press. The American was a Har- vard psychotherapist named Timothy Leary, who has since found himself trans- mogrified from scientist and researcher into progenitor and high priest of a revo- lutionary movement. At dinner the night after the visions, the maid asked if she could take the mushrooms over to the ser- vants' cottage to show her husband. Ah, Lola, you want him to find you some? Lola's eyes narrowed and she made a gesture of disgust. No, Senor. Mdlos. Muy males. Ruth leaned forward, rapid Spanish. Why do you want your husband to see them, Lola? The maid took a step backward, crouching. So he will see them, Sehora, and know them, and never eat them. The plate with black twisted mushrooms was on the mantel. When I picked it up several flies spiraled away. Lola held the plate at arm's length and scuttled from the room. Lola's face had a look of bitter dread. I didn't know then that we were to meet this same fear of the visionary unknown at every step along the road to come. Ruth was looking out the window and she turned with a puzzled smile on her face. Strange sight, she said. Lola's half-running across the lawn with the plate of mushrooms in one hand and crossing her- self with the other. There was fear in the air the next day in Mexico City. I sensed it on the Paseo de la Reforma, the broad, grand pride of Mexico. Twelve cars wide, split by grass strips and tree lanes, lined with statues, sweeping into round wide glorietas, hum- ming like a power-line with speeding cars. As I drove along near Sanborns, the traffic slowed. The American embassy building was ringed with hun- dreds of police troopers, black boots, black leather belts. They looked half-fierce and half-embarrassed. I remembered reading about the left-wing student riots. Cuba si. Yanqui, no. The government was moving with a nervous show of force. I was having lunch with a sociologist named Lewis. Trouble as usual parking, and I found him"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"September 1960 00 37 waiting at a table in Prendes. He declined a cigarette and hesitated when I ordered a vermouth and then decided to join me. He talked about his studies of village life in southern Mexico and Guatemala. He had lifted the lid and poked around inside and what he described wasn't pretty. The sick. The miserable. The bullies. The victims. The hopeless. The grinding pressure of no money, lousy food, distrust, waking before dawn in a cold hut, your body stiff and crusted with yesterday's sweat and dirt, your mouth sour, your bowels running, haunted by your debts, your fearful ignorance of why it all works out this way and what to do. Lewis really told you how it was in concrete terms. Human helplessness. No happy theories to explain it away either. I liked him for that. We ordered seafood and I had a half-bottle of smoky Mexican white wine. Lewis was a sensitive man. He was disturbed by what he had seen and had to write about. He loved the Mexicans and hated sociological theory. He was bitter because he had been attacked by the political book reviewers, and the psychoanalytic book reviewers and the theorists and his American colleagues who saw a rich, pa'ssionate, Freudian warmth in his villagers. He had heard vaguely of the sacred mushrooms but had never paid much attention to the reports about them. Mandy and I took the elevator way up to the skytop restaurant of the Latino-American building. We sat drinking tequila and looking through the glass wall out over the valley of Mexico. The air was hazy blue except where some white clouds hung over the western volcanic peaks. The whole historic bit was right there in front of us. There was the dusty flatland around the airport which used to be a lake and the old colonial section with crum- bling tezontle churches and palaces, and the sky- scrapers running out to the modern sections and there out beyond, the acres of tenements. We watched airliners sliding down sloping trajectories and I thought of Dick Alpert flying to Mexico to pick me up in his Cessna, at this moment, some- where a mile high over Jalisco, poring over his airmaps and checking the green patterns below, A movement spawned not by an idea but by a sub- stance that's been called \"the spiritual equivalent of the hydrogen bomb.\" Few men, in their youth, would have seemed less likely to emerge as a reli- gious leader, let alone as a rebel with a cause. At the age of 19, Leary dis- tressed his Roman Catholic mother by abandoning Holy Cross two years before graduation (\"The scholastic approach to religion didn't turn me on\"). Then he affronted his father, a retired army ca- reer officer, by walking out of West Point after 18 months (\"My interests were philosophic rather than mil- itaristic\"). Not until he transferred to the University of Alabama did he begin to settle down academically to work for his B.A. in psychology. On graduation in 1942, he enlisted as an army psy- chologist, served in a Penn- sylvania hospital until the end of the war."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"38 00 The Revelation Is Awe-Full He then resumed his schooling and earned his Ph.D. at the University of California at Berkeley. Acquiring both eminence and enemies with his first major jobs as director of Oakland's progressive Kaiser Foundation hospital and as an assistant pro- fessor at UC's school of medicine in San Francisco. Leary began to display the courage and sometimes rash iconoclasm that have since marked every phase of his checkered career. Contending that traditional psychiatric methods were hurting as many patients as they helped, he resigned in 1958 and signed up as a lecturer on clinical psy- chology at Harvard. Here he began to evolve and enunciate the theory of social interplay and per- sonal behavior as so many stylized games, since popu- larized by Dr. Eric Berne in his best-selling book, Games People Play. looking for the landmarks to guide him in to the Guadalajara airport. I had started taking narcotics too early in the day, wine at lunch, tequila in the cocktail lounge and by the time the good restaurants were serving dinner, I was heavy and tired. Liquor contracts consciousness. Soggy symbols. Mandy was being very college-girl. I was missing the Semitic mermaid with the sculptured lines and got bored and irri- table. A classic liquor high. Around midnight we ran into Poet Betty in the mariachi section. By this time, the taste of tequila was perfumey obnoxious and the lime taste was acrid and the musicians were puffy, pouter pigeons buttoned into their fake ranchero costumes just as sick of singing the same old ballads as I was of hearing them. When Guadalajara de Noche closed at one o'clock, we had coffee in the mariachi market and I drove Poet Betty home and then stood in the hallway of Mandy's house and for a moment I felt the message of the mushrooms which is the wordless, mindless rapture of the moment. I started a miserable debate with myself about the next move. I wanted to drive to Cuernavaca but I knew that I'd have to come back to meet Dick Alpert at the airport next after- noon. Around three in the morning I was standing in front of the hotel, Virreyes, leaning against a lamp- post, sodden, tired, hung on the hooks of indecision, deciding whether to drive back or sleep the rest of the night in the city. The coin came down stay. As I turned to walk to the hotel entrance, my shoe caught in a metal hook sticking from the bottom of the post. I moved forward. My shoe caught. I fell. Crouched on the sidewalk, on my hands and knees, I looked up. A group of taxi-drivers and Mexican hotel hangers-on were standing at the lobby en- trance. Their talk stopped and they turned to stare down at me. My eyes moved from one face to the next, to the next. Then I lifted myself up slowly, slapped the dirt from my hands and walked into the hotel. When I got to Mandy's house for lunch there was a message. Dick Alpert had phoned from Guadala-"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"September 1960 00 39 jara and would be landing at Mexico City airport in an hour. I found him closing his flight plan in the operations office. Dick is tall, blond, and boyish, full of silly enthusiasms and during his three-day flight down the west coast and over the mountains he had fallen in love with Mexico. We piled his luggage in the car and stopped at a tienda for beer and potato chips and headed out past the university on to the toll road and started climbing through the cloudy passes out of the valley. Dick stretched out his legs in the front seat and began telling me how happy the Mexican people were and how much more sensible their life was than the American. On his flight down, there was always a cab driver who would see him circling over the town and by the time Dick had set the plane down on the cow- pasture runway, the taxi would be waiting for him and sometimes there would be not one but two or three girls in the cab for him to take his pick. They're relaxed. They smile. They love music. They know what the important values are. That's right, Dick, I said. And when they get bored with their small town and their cab and the whorehouse where they work, why they just jump in their plane and fly away to the next country that hits their fancy. Dick flashed his modest boy smile. I suppose I'm talking like the typical naive American tourist. The happy native bit. They're stuck. They have no choice. Is that right? I told him that I didn't know. Because I didn't know. But I was sure that the Mexicans had no secrets that Americans lack, because there weren't any Mexicans at all but fifty million men and women with eyes and ears and brains and hearts more or less hung up on their own mental chess- boards, different from our chess pieces maybe, but hung up all the same. So, I didn't know. Ever since last weekend and the mushrooms I didn't know as much any more. I had started the slow process of throwing things out of mind, junking mental furniture that had been clogging up my brain. I used to know a lot about Mexico, generalizations, theories.

At the time, predictably enough, few of these novel notions went over very well with Leary's hidebound col- leagues. But their rumblings of skepticism rose to a chorus of outrage when Leary re- turned to Harvard in 1960 from his pioneering voyage into inner space. He began experimenting on himself, his associates, and hundreds of volunteer sub- jects with measured doses of psilocybin, the chemical derivative of the sacred mushrooms, vowing \"to dedicate the rest of my life as a psy- chologist to the systematic exploration of this new in- strument.\" He and his rapidly multiply- ing followers began to turn on with the other psyche- delic drugs: morning glory seeds, nut- meg, marijuana, peyote, mescaline and a colorless, odorless, tasteless but in- credibly potent laboratory compound called LSD 25."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"40 00 The Revelation Is Awe-Full LSD was first synthesized in 1938 by a Swiss biochemist seeking a pain-killer for migraine headaches.

Feelings of detachment. Intensification of color and sound. Euphoria. Sense of having discovered some great wisdom. Every- one's been smoking pot for years around San Fran- cisco and Greenwich Village. There are regular cults of tea-heads. A friend of mine gave me two pounds of pot when he left for Europe. I smoked it for awhile but got bored with it and finally it dried up and I threw most of it away. This was some development! Was that all I had experienced? Were the mystic visions and the orien- tal dreams just a stronger version of a Greenwich Village pot high? I had been sure we were on the verge of something new and great.

The headlights on the white ponchos slumped over plodding burros. The valley of Tepoztlan is haunted.

I was way behind on my writing, but all I did was soak up sun and sweat and think. I tried to ask Dick Dettering about the mushrooms but he didn't want to talk. He was worrying about giving a lecture in Spanish. He had given the speech a hundred times in English, but he had no ear for Spanish and when he read the translation he sounded like a Midwesterner reading names from the Cuernavaca telephone book. He seemed to have forgotten the mushrooms. When the sun would get too hot, I'd take my son Jack's rubber water goggles and his snorkle breath- ing tube and swim in the pool.

Let me say this: when I was 39 I had my first psychedelic ex- perience. At that time I was a middle-aged man in- volved in the middle-aged process of dying. My joy in life, my sensual openness, my creativity were all sliding downhill. Since that time, six years ago, my life has been re- newed in almost every di- mension."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"42 00 The Revelation Is Awe-Full Most of my colleagues at the University of California and at Harvard, of course, feel that I've become ec- centric and a kook.

The Soviet cultural attache coming down for the day. I had met him twice at cocktail parties where he had been sur- rounded by my countrymen, politically wise beyond their years from reading Time magazine and liquored up enough to think they could win the great debate. Both times I had felt shame at the spectacle and had moved in to talk friendly with him about Russian education and his impressions of Mexico and Cuba. He was young, new at his job, eager to be liked, well-informed, terribly confident, proud of his country, and, when tight, pathetically puzzled at why Americans misunderstood him and his peaceful intentions. I wanted things to go smoothly when Leonov and his friends arrived for lunch. The pool should be emptied and cleaned. This meant a clash with Lola the maid. To her it meant extra work and a larger water bill to explain to her absentee land- lords. Nothing for her to gain. Something to lose. Passive resistance. Also, she had changed since I took the mushrooms. She was suspicious. I had angered her somehow. Made her afraid of me. I knew she'd stall until 3:30 so our water would drain on the eighth green of the golf club after sunset. At 3:30 I mobilized my son and Pepe his friend. If we cleaned it now and started filling at sundown it would be full enough for the Russians to swim the next day. Pepe, go tell your mother we are going to clean the pool. Lola came darting out of her cottage. She shook her head as we talked. The gardener was at school. Mariana. Mariana es mejor. Hear me, Lola, Tomor- row is Friday. Come friends tomorrow from Mex- ico. Necessitates much time to fill the pool. Correct? We must clean the pool today or wait until Mon- day. True? Okay, Lola, you are the director. We shall wait. But she didn't. In the morning the pool was clean but empty. A thin trickle of fresh water puddled on the bottom. No one would swim today, Russians or Americans. Ruth was drinking coffee. She was calm and amused at my anger. She defended the maid. Lola was in the kitchen. When I finished giving her my"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"September 1960 00 43 opinion I banged my hand on the metal sink. Ruth's cool disapproving eyes followed me into the bed- room. I was in a rage, undercut by both women. Gone mushroom tranquility. I was still smarting when the Russian came. The day went badly. It was hot and they had brought their bathing suits. Aztec duplicity exposed Ameri- can inhospitality to Communist diplomat. We sat by the end of the pool listening to the thin splash of water and drank too much too early in the day. I talked to him about the mushrooms, but he wasn't interested and became irritable. The weary pushing of alcohol-soggy symbols back and forth across the board. He wanted to know why Americans used germ warfare in Korea. The only mistake the Rus- sians made in Hungary was to delay sending in troops. Russian women were by far the most beau- tiful in the world. The American secret police would arrest me if he came to see me in America. I was going to give him my address so that he would be sure to visit me in Cambridge anyway, but after they left, I remembered that I had forgotten. Lola had stayed out of sight most of the day, and when she appeared down on the lawn feeding the animals, our eyes never met. The next day was my last day at the villa. Dick Alpert and my son and I were to fly back to California after the weekend. And the weekend continued bad. Gerhart and Joan and Mandy ar- rived at noon. They brought no mushrooms. Ger- hart had climbed for three hours to reach the village, but Juana the witch was nowhere to be found. No one knew where she was nor when she'd come back. The villagers were mysterious and evasive. This didn't bother any of last week's veterans. No one really wanted to repeat. I was expecting one prospective mushroomer later in the day, but I wasn't disturbed by the thought of his missing out. He was an anthropologist who had spent three years in a Mexican village, which he now called \"my village,\" and he and his wife sang Mexican ballads together and produced endless facts about Mexican life. He was a pleasant intellectual chap He's frozen like a Pavlovian dog to this conditioned re- flex. To people under 25, on the other hand, the word \"drug\" refers to a wide range of mind benders running from alcohol, ener- gizers, and stupefiers to marijuana and the other psychedelic drugs. To middle-aged America, it may be synonymous with instant insanity, but to most Americans under 25, the psychedelic drug means ecstasy, sensual unfolding, religious experience, reve- lation, illumination, contact with nature. There's not a teen-ager or young person in the United States today who doesn't know at least one person who has had a good ex- perience with marijuana or LSD. The horizons of the current younger generation, in terms of expanded con- sciousness, are light-years beyond those of their par- ents. The breakthrough has oc- curred; there's no going back.

Evolutionary misunderstand- ing causes bloodshed and imprisonment. but scared stiff of the mushrooms. He wanted to take them because it was like a duty. If he was to know Mexico he should know the native ritual. Gerhart had an idea. We can give him the mush- rooms left over from last week. They're dried by now, but that's all right. They retain their potency indefinitely. Just to make sure, we can start him out on a stronger dose. The anthropologist and his wife arrived at two and when I went to the gate to let them in, there were three American college kids about to ring the bell. They were friends of Poet Betty. The boy was a Princeton sophomore and the girls were just starting at Mount Holyoke College. The college crowd went inside to change into swimming suits and I mixed drinks and sat in the dining room talking with the anthropologist about the mush- room situation. He said he was willing to try them dried. His wife would watch. He was extremely nervous. To relieve this situation I have asked the younger generation to cool it for a year and to use this mora- torium period to explain to their parents and to their jailers what LSD and marijuana are, and why we want and intend to use them. I have made clear that this is a voluntary waiving of the constitutional right to change your own con- sciousness. Do you wish to look, Frodo? said the Lady Galad- riel. You did not wish to see Elf -magic and were content. Do you advise me to look? asked Frodo. No, she said. I do not counsel you one way or another. I am not a counsellor. You may learn something, and whether what you see be fair or evil, that may be profitable, and yet it may not. Seeing is both good and perilous. Yet I think, Frodo, that you have courage and wisdom enough for the venture, or I would not have brought you here. Do as you will! I will look, said Frodo, and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over the dark water. (The Lord of the Rings) But I suggested this as a conciliatory gesture to mol- lify and educate the older generation and to allow time for the younger people to learn more about how to turn on. I was worried a bit about the anthropological panic and decided to round up someone to take the visions with him. If necessary, I was resolved to join him myself, although I had no desire to do so.

The psychedelic generation. So we all sat around the dining room table while I counted the black twisted knobs into five bowls. Eight for anthro. Eight for Princeton. Eight to tall Mount Holyoke, eight to short. And eight in the fifth bowl which I kept in front of me. Three college kids examined the dried sticks curiously and popped them in their mouths. They went through their bowls quickly. Good little chil- dren. Then they sat back happily waiting for the trance. Not anthro. He picked up a knob, studied it from every angle, sniffed it, asked several questions about their origin and their effect. I could see drops of sweat on his brow just below the hair line. He didn't look happy. Finally, seeing that we were all watching him, waiting, he bit the end of the plant and made tasting sounds. Then his face scrunched up. Whew, they taste rotten. Are you sure they aren't poisonous? He took another bite and asked about dysentery. He continued to eat very slowly, forcing them down. The green bowl in front of me became a magnet. Why not take them and return to the garden of ecstasy? More wisdom waits there. My mind argued for taking the mushrooms. So simple. There they are in the bowl ten inches from your mouth. But there wasn't one shred of desire pushing me towards them. My brain said yes. The second ex- perience will be more enlightening. It will give you a basis for comparison. But I was scared too. I must have spent five minutes sitting there holding a black knob between my thumb and forefinger. Finally, I threw it back and pushed the bowl away. I'll take them if Dick Alpert wants to join me when he arrives. The college crowd had long since drifted out to the patio, lying on beach chairs, waiting. Anthro still sat stiffly in front of his half-emptied bowl. He never did finish them. His wife sat next to him in solemn silence. After thirty minutes, after forty minutes, after fifty minutes, nothing had happened. After an hour the colleges ate the rest of the mushrooms and after I'm demanding that this period also be a mora- torium on hysterical legis- lation and on punitive ar- rests of young people for the possession of LSD and marijuana. If at the end of one year, the older generation has not taken advantage of this cease-fire, I predict and in- deed urge a firm statement on the part of everyone in- volved that they intend to resume the use of psyche- delics. That they will exercise their constitutional rights to ex- pand their own conscious- ness whatever the cost. Playboy: What do you say to the standard charge that LSD is too powerful and dangerous to entrust to the young? Leary: Well, none of us yet knows exactly how LSD can be used for the growth and benefit of the human being. It is a powerful releaser of energy as yet not fully un- derstood. But if I'm con- fronted with the possibility that a 15-year-old or a 50- year-old is going to use a new form of energy that he doesn't understand, I'll back the 15-year-old every time."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"46 00 The Revelation Is Awe-Full Why? Because a 15-year- old is going to use a new form of energy to have fun, to intensify sensation, to make love, for curiosity, for personal growth. Many 50-year-olds have lost their curiosity, have lost their ability to make love, have dulled their openness to new sensations, and would use any form of new energy for power, control, and warfare. So it doesn't concern me at all that young people are taking time out from the educational and occupa- tional assembly lines to ex- periment with conscious- ness, to dabble with new forms of experience and ar- tistic expression. The present generation un- der the age of 25 is the wisest and holiest genera- tion that the human race has ever seen. And, by God, instead of lamenting, derogating and imprisoning them, we should support them, listen to them, and turn on with them. 00 two hours there was nothing to do but to apologize like a poor host. The college faces were fallen in disappointment, but anthro and wife didn't seem to mind. Dick Alpert and the McClellands from Tepoztlan arrived and some more people from the capital dropped in and a professor from Amherst got lec- turing drunk and a State Department officer, who was bitter about his job and our Latin policy and his boss, got very funny, sarcastic drunk and the others sat around the table and made intellectual talk. And that was about the way the summer in Cuernavaca ended. Oh no, there was one final incident on Sunday morning. I went through that saddest routine of packing and checking the house over and over again, finding things that I had forgotten. Not enough room in the trunks and all this with a hangover and not enough sleep and the lousy feel- ing that had persisted all week since Dick Alpert told me about marijuana. Lola was still keeping out of sight and when I did intersect her in the dining room, she looked at me with distrust and narrowed her eyes as though I were dangerous somehow. When the last suitcase was locked, my son made the inevitable discovery that a toy had been left out. It was a plastic machine gun that shot corks. He and Pepe had been ambushing enemy all sum- mer with their guns. It was large and bulky and impossible to pack. Then an image of Lola in the final scene occurred to me. Look, Jack, I want you to leave the gun here, okay? All right, but why? Pepe already has one. Never mind. Watch and you'll see. When I took the last suitcase out to the car, I was carrying the gun. I laid it carefully on the driver's seat. Then I gave Lola two hundred and fifty pesos and we said good-bye and promised to write and we moved out to the sidewalk. Dick Alpert and Jack were in the car. I called Jack out and handed him the machine gun. Jack, give this to Lola and say this is for her.

IFIF (pronounced \"if-if,\" as if the speaker is stuttering over some terrifying cosmic question). I stood behind the car and watched Jack come up to Lola and make his speech and watched her take the gun and look surprised and then laugh. She seemed to understand and she seemed pleased. She called something to me. I be back soon, I said. She was nodding and smiling when the gun went off. Her face froze as she saw the cork bounce off my chest. Her eyes dropped down to the trigger still held taut by her finger. Then when she saw me laughing, she lifted the gun in front of her face as though it were an apron to hide behind and she began to giggle. We were all grinning like pleased idiots as I got back in the car and made the U-turn. And as we rolled off and waved adios, I was laughing and she was standing with the gun in her right hand. IFIF preaches the gospel that man's salvation lies in the expansion of his own consciousness, a state which, it is asserted, can be achieved through the in- gestion of such substances as LSD-25, psilocybin, mes- caline or even the right type of morning-glory seeds. Although a handful of well- known people most of the philosophers, mystics, and theologians have lent IFIF support of their names, sci- entific circles have in gen- eral been quite critical of many of its expressed be- liefs and goals. The support of the theolo- gians and mystics, in com- bination with the fact that IFIF's cause was unwit- tingly nurtured within Har- vard University, has com- posed the movement's prin- cipal credentials. Hence the image of many clouds, promising mois- ture and blessing to the land, although as yet no rain falls. The situation is not unfavorable; there is a prospect of ultimate success, but there are still obstacles in the way, and we can merely take preparatory measures. Only through the small means of friendly persuasion can we exert any influence. The time has not yet come for sweeping measures. However, we may be able, to a limited extent, to act as a restraining and subduing influ- ence. To carry out our purpose we need firm deter- mination within and gentleness and adaptability in external relations.

Should we climb those clouds or sidestep them through that gap to the north? In touch with only this immediate reality is Acapulco there or there?

Perhaps as many as 70 per- cent of all users now are high school and college students. . . . 00 or a concept but a right-now decision about this peak, that cloud, this push on the rudder which turns us towards Acapulco airport or the mountain cliff. We were flying at no miles per hour, with the jagged cotton fields ten feet below stretched out as far as we could see. The world was completely shut off. Somewhere down below were the mountains of Guerrero and Acapulco Bay and the Pacific. But we were above and out of it, skudding along the mile- high, white-capped ocean. Dick was leaning forward studying the horizon and sweeping his eyes down and over the instru- ments and then back to the front. He turned to brief me. Here's the situation. We're okay up here. We're high enough to miss this stuff (he was pointing to the orange peaks on the map) but sooner or later we'll have to land and that means diving down blind through this white crud. We can't turn back? No, that's no good. Mexico City is already socked in tight. And, if we tried to chance it north or south, there's no guarantee that the clouds will break, at 5:45 the acapulco tower RECEIVED A CALL FROM AN AIRCRAFT ON THE UNICON. What we'll have to do is keep flying high and wide until we get well beyond the coast, out over the ocean, and then we plough down through the clouds until we hit the clear above the ocean and then we'll have to turn back and run the coast until we find Acapulco. All we have to do is be sure we fly far enough to miss the coastal range and hope there's enough ceiling over the Pacific, rut the AIRCRAFT IDENTIFICATION WAS UNINTELLIGD3LE DUE TO poor transmission. I'll see if I can get Acapulco tower for a reading on their ceiling. Dick fiddled with the radio dial with his left hand and then he took the black plastic mouthpiece in his right hand. Acapulco, this is Cessna four-six Bravo. Do you hear me? repeated attempts to ESTARLISH RADIO CONTACT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. We waited, listening to the engine hum and the rush of air past the cabin windows. Acapulco tower. This is Cessna four-six Bravo. Come in Acapulco. No an- swer. Maybe they don't catch the English.

It was obvious that my hands clutched to the wheel wouldn't hold up the plane and its load, it cut through the trees for a DISTANCE OF 416 FEET REFORE IT FINALLY CAME TO rest.

They say it brings supernatural powers. It does not, say U.C.L.A. psychiatrists. Some say it is an aphrodis- iac. It is not. They say it helps the user to solve his emotional prob- lems. It may but only if the solu- tion is already in the mind, hidden behind an emotional block. What LSD actually has done for far too many users, says U.C.L.A.'s psychiatric resi- dent Duke D. Fisher, is to produce \"florid psycho- ses with terrifying visual and auditory hallucinations, marked depression, often with serious suicide at- tempts and anxiety border- ing on panic.\" One patient tried to kill him- self when he thought his body was melting, and he remained suicidal for more than two weeks, after only one dose of LSD. at this. He was pointing over there to the left to a hole, a tiny hole in the gray clouds, a peep hole, a rent in the cotton fabric and through it glistening the blue water, the ocean. Let me take her down, that hole is closing fast. He swung the stick over and rolled the plane dizzy- ingly on its side and we began to fall sideways, stomach gasping, ears hurting, and by now the hole in the clouds was smaller than our wingspread but we needled through it, falling sideways, left cheek pointing to the lovely gray-green endless rippling world of water below. The next problem is to find land and then run up the coast to Acapulco. Dick was banking sharply to the right and as we turned the long corner and leveled off, there were the high cliffs on one side with the hotels stuck on top and there way over to the right was the high promontory rolling to the sea, with the villas and hotels nailed to the slopes, and we were slicing a line right smack down the middle of Acapulco Bay. We had hit it blindly right on the center. The wind can indeed drive the clouds together in the sky; yet, being nothing but air, without solid body, it does not produce great or lasting effects. So also an individual, in times when he can pro- duce no great effect in the outer world, can do nothing except refine the expression of his nature in small ways.

Then Jack sprang again the question he had been springing all summer and never answered how about skin diving? It was now or never be- cause we were flying north at summer's end. Dick pulled out a map and checked the mileage and we counted up the flying hours on our fingers and Dick looked at Jack's hopeful eyes and said, sure, we can afford an hour or two for something important like skin diving and Jack began to grin.

I was to dive first for a half -hour while Jack watched and then he was to take over. I stood knee-deep in the warm surf and Jose lifted the tank on my back and began strapping me in while I braced my legs against the weight. The belt of round lead slugs got tied around my waist and the rubber mask over my eyes and Jose showed me how to clear the mask of water by tilting the corner and blowing and he stuck the rubber tube end in my mouth and I felt the cold surgical taste of oxygen and heard the hiss hiss of the air rush and a cast- iron mechanical duck waddled with finned feet out beyond the breakers and Jose's brown arms mo- tioned down and I took a deep gulp of the cool rubbery air in the mouthpiece and pushed down under the surface. Down to no place. I didn't sink and I didn't rise, just stayed there suspended a foot or so under water getting used to breathing through a tube and fighting the panic, the panic bred of the lifelong habit of rising to the surface to breathe. Jose was right there by me and I watched the bubbles up around his face and looked inside his mask at the black eyes glaring out and saw his hands motioning down and his sleek brown legs pumping and him slicing down fishy deeper, hands and feet finning him along. He stopped and turned and made wavy gill motions and I got the point and pushed clumsy with my hands up and kicked and started dropping down and there was the bottom, sandy and clear, every brown grain in sharp focus and the bottom creatures, tawny purple shells and spiny quilled animals breathing softly, and clean rocks. We were swimming along together slowly, two giant humpbacked fish nosing across this new bot- tom world. Jose turned and put his thumb and fore- finger together to ask okay and I made the same sign, sure okay and I saw his eyes inside the mask smiling at me and right there at that moment everything became okay, exultant new world vision, a new thrilly freedom down down down in the blue glass light world. Other patients have re- quired more than two months of psychiatric hos- pitalization. Still others have been sent to state hospitals for long- term treatment. Adds U.C.L.A. psychiatrist J.

Many users have had this experience.\" The varied types of LSD users include vast numbers of thrill seekers. Most have tried marijuana, then the amphetamines, be- fore \"graduating\" them- selves to what they regard as the ultimate in kicks. In the rebellious student groups like those at Berke- ley many are trying LSD be- cause they feel lost on an impersonal, bustling campus: Others have been squeezed by the need to make better grades to avoid the draft.

Inside it were books and woodwork and thick rugs and metal-work lamps and a wide staircase winding up from the entrance hall. Took a couple of days to get settled. And on the third day I drove down to Newton Corner and crossed to Charlesbank Road and along the curving river towards Cambridge. At this point the Charles is a wide, slow stream. On the other side a Norman tower sticks up from the trees, and down aways the bridge on the Watertown Road loops across in three arches, simple and clean like Ponte Santa Trinita, reflected in the water below. After a while the river swings to the left towards Cambridge and then back again in a grand slow sweep, and there on the right is Soldier's Field and beyond it the roofs of the Harvard Business School, very European ( Copenhagen, mostly ) , with dozens of little chimneys sticking up, and over to the left the three shiny colored domes red, green, blue and the Harvard brick.

The fact that they told you Stop and Go was incidental to what they told you about color and light. I was still turned on. My office was in the Center for Personality Re- search, Harvard University. The house was named after Morton Prince, one of the first American psy- chologists to recognize alterations in consciousness as a critical area for study.

Today he would be considered a far-out scholar with his curious and bold interests in multiple personality, hypnosis, trances, and visions. It was somehow most natural and proper that we would be initiating studies into altered states of consciousness in Morton Prince House. The precedent for our psychedelic research did not begin with Morton Prince, however, but traced back to the turn of the century, to that most venerable and greatest of American psychologists, William James, who had mystic experiences using nitrous oxide and saw God and scandalized people by running drug parties in Boston's stuffy Back Bay. After Morton Prince and William James, the genealogical line of consciousness expansion re- search at Harvard was continued by another giant in the history of psychology: Harry A. Murray and his visionary scene of green shirts, white whales, Freud- Jung-Melville. When Harry Murray retired and moved his office to a house next door and nailed his whale emblem over the threshold, a new director came into the Center. David C. McClelland is a non-visionary Quaker, a Protestant-ethic man, intelligent, tall, puritan, dedicated to external achievement. Professor McClelland had visited the villa in Cuernavaca the week after I took the magic mush- rooms, and was shocked and grumpy when I told him about my trip. He was the first person I had wanted to try the mushrooms, and his instinctive withdrawal jolted me. The Quakers were founded by a flipped-out hallucinating visionary named George Fox, who turned-on and dropped-out and spent six years in prison for passing on the same message I got from the Aztec plant. I couldn't understand then why any psychologist, especially a member of a mystic sect like the Quakers, wouldn't rush to have the experience. When I opened the front door of Harvard's Center for Personality Research, there in the library From The Varieties of Reli- gious Experience by Wil- liam James: Our normal waking con- sciousness parted from the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of con- sciousness entirely differ- ent.

He had been wanting George to give him mescaline for several months but they never got around to it. He was eager to start. What a great research tool! The word research stopped me. Psychiatric sci- ence. Good God, here we go again. Using drugs to do something to somebody else. Drug them. Then test the changes. Measuring the impact of chemi- cals on the mind. It was this sort of manipulatory business that had repelled me from experimental drug research in the past. Those who have ears to hear, let them hear: To me the living sense of its reality only comes in the artificial mystic state of mind. 00 A Ring of Power looks after itself, Frodo.

But as far as I know, Bilbo alone in history has ever gone beyond playing, and really done it. He needed all my help, too. And even so he would never have just forsaken it, or cast it aside. It was not Gollum, Frodo, but the Ring itself that decided things. The Ring left him.

What does the patient really think? What does he really feel? Psychoanalysis, the study of dreams. Slips of the tongue. Tests of fantasy expression in which the subject unwittingly gives away his secret inclina- tions. It was natural that men would use mescaline and LSD to get high and it was also natural that psychologists would see mescaline and LSD as new manipulatory instruments for cutting through de- fenses and exposing inner feelings. New ways of knocking out the social man and laying bare the sick, evil man within. To interpret the visionary experience laymen use the language of ecstasy, and psychiatrists use the language which is familiar and natural to them the dialect of diagnosis. Now the curious thing about psychiatric language is that it's almost com- pletely negative, a pompous, gloomy lexicon of troubles, symptoms, abnormalities, eccentricities. To read through the psychiatric literature is to descend into the modern Freudian Inferno prim, prudish catalogue of anguish and conflict. The psychiatric trip is worried and nervous. Revelation is a dirty word. When they observe mystical reactions to the southern vegetables, psy- chiatrists employ the labels of pathology. Peyote and mescaline and LSD produce thoughts and behavior which are not conventionally normal. These events are called abnormal. Very unconven- tional. Therefore very abnormal! Psychotic! The psychiatrists are hung up on psychosis, whatever that is. And so the new consciousness- expanding substances in i960 were classed as psychotomimetic. Psychiatrists thought that LSD causes normal people to act like psychotics! And glorious mescaline too! And the mushroom! So when I heard Mike asking me about research plans for the mushrooms, my first reaction was, oh, no, baby! No! No! No! No selecting of subjects. No testing them before and after. No explaining away the mushroom effect in terms of my favorite vari- ables or your favorite variables. No chemical pro- cedures ripping away people's protections and watching them deal with the sudden confrontation Psychiatric Report: The volunteers selected were told only that they might receive a substance which would produce tem- porary changes in percep- tion and bodily feelings or an inert substance.

Well, Mike, it depends what you mean by re- search. Td love to take the mushrooms again. And I'd like to give them to my friends and have them see what I saw. In fact I'd be glad to spend the rest of my life teaching people how to use them. And I'd like everyone who takes the mushrooms to write down afterwards what he saw and felt and visioned and how the whole scene affected his life. George and Mike were listening and nodding and swinging along with this and began to throw in ideas. Why not start a research like this. There would be no scientists vs. people-studied in our research. Everyone would take turns taking the mushrooms and observing and keeping careful rec- ords of how we change and what we experience. And we'd all meet together to plan the sessions and there would be no withholding of information or results, it would all be out on the table for everyone to know. No calling people names. No diagnosing. And we would try to get a variety of people in- volved in the group. Not just psychologists and behavioral scientists but writers and poets and housewives and cab drivers. I was particularly pleased with the collaborative, no-leader aspect of the plan. I wanted to avoid selecting the members of the mushroom research group. I told George and Mike that they knew more people around the university and the town of Cambridge than I did and that they should do the selecting of collaborators to take the mushrooms with us. George and Mike said sure and began talk- ing together excitedly throwing names back and forth. Plenty of spirit around. Then George began to talk about the literature on visionary states and asked me if I had read Aldous Huxley's books on mescaline, Doors to Per- ception and Heaven and Hell, and when I said I hadn't he rushed down the hall to his office and brought them back.

Gerhart back in Mexico had told me that he'd continue the search for Juana the witch and if he found her he'd get a large supply and send some up to me. And Frank Barron back in Berkeley had told me that the people at the University of Mexico had cultivated mushrooms and maybe we could get some from them. That night I read Huxley. And then I read those two books again. And again. It was all there. All my vision. And more too. Huxley had taken mescaline in a garden and shucked off the mind and awakened to eternity. You shouldn't point out faults in others that might exist in yourself. After the drug he said, At who? That depends on a lot of things. About a week later someone at a party told me that Aldous Huxley was spending the fall in town and that sounded like a good omen, so I sat down and wrote him a letter. Two days later, during one of our planning con- ferences, Mr. Huxley telephoned to say he was interested and lunch was arranged. Aldous Huxley was staying in a new M.I.T. apartment overlooking the Charles River. He an- swered the bell tall, pale, frail joined me, and we drove to the Harvard Faculty Club. He read the menu slowly through his magnifying glass. I asked him if he wanted soup and he asked what kind and I looked at the menu and it was mushroom soup so we laughed and we had mushrooms for lunch. Aldous Huxley: stooped, towering, gray Buddha.

Avoid labeling or depersonalizing the subject. We should not impose our own jargon or our own experimental games on others. We were not out to discover new laws, which is to say, to discover the redundant implications of our own Autonomic responses, pu- pillary dilation, nausea, diz- ziness, flushing, abdominal complaints, blood pressure, and pulse. . . .

Huxley offered to sit in on our planning meetings and was ready to take mushrooms with us when the research was under way. From these meetings grew the design for a natu- ralistic pilot study, in which the subjects would be treated like astronauts carefully prepared, briefed with all available facts, and then expected to run their own spacecraft, make their own observations, and report back to ground control. Our subjects were not passive patients but hero-explorers. During the weeks of October and November of i960 there were many meetings to plan the re- search. Aldous Huxley would come and listen and then close his eyes and detach himself from the scene and go into his controlled meditation trance, which was unnerving to some of the Harvard people who equate consciousness with talk, and then he would open his eyes and make a diamond- pure comment. We talked about having tape recordings and music and reproductions of paintings and mystical quotations, and people volunteered to round up the props and there was only one thing wrong with the meetings and that was that it was all talk and no action. That is, no mushrooms. It was like sitting around planning and talking about sex: we were all hungry and impatient for the mushrooms to arrive. We hoped that they would come that week and if so we'd have the first session on Sunday. By Friday they hadn't come and we made careful plans to pick up the package at the post office if it came on Saturday. I didn't realize until later how eager and anxious people were. The tension was mounting and it kept mounting Saturday morning until George phoned everyone and said that they weren't at the post office, and the first session was postponed a week. Big letdown and then the ten- sion started up again. On Wednesday afternoon I came into the office and my secretary Clair said, Oh, by the way, the mushrooms just arrived. Where are they? George and Mike took them and are keeping the package in their office. I walked down the hall to their office From the Boston Record American Mailbag: Your editorial, Controlling LSD, was excellent, but it did not go far enough.

This gave me a funny feeling of frustration. The mushrooms had arrived but I couldn't see them. Out of my hands, out of my control. The next morning Mike came by my office to chat about the session coming up that weekend. He didn't mention that the mushrooms had arrived. I said, Oh, by the way, I understand that the pack- age arrived from Sandoz. Mike took a step back- ward and blinked. Oh, yes, they came yesterday. Where are they now?

There were four small gray pill- boxes inside labeled PS 39, and printed on the label, not to be sold, for research investigation. There was a plastic stopper and a wad of cotton in the neck of the little brown bottle and then I shook out in my hand the round pink pills, glistening like pearls on my hand. There they were. Keys to the doors to perception. I poured them back in the bottle and stuffed the bottle back in the box and said, let's keep them here in my filing cabinet.

After we shopped and came home I filled the ice-cooler and brought a bottle of whisky and soda into the study and we sat drinking until dinner, and every time the whisky would start to relax me the kids would get into a quarrel and I'd bound out to stop it, or the phone would ring and then I'd mix another drink to quiet down again. We had a bottle of Burgundy with the steak and by dinner's end I was feeling a fine alcohol stupor. In the living room Joan was lying in front of the fire, and a friend Joe O'Donell had come in and was mixing drinks and we started joking and laugh- ing at O'Donell's crazy stories. Then Rhona and Charlie came down from the third floor to join in the noise. They were the young couple who took care of the house, pretty little blonde Rhona and big happy Charlie finishing his fourth year at Boston University. After a while we fell to talking about the mush- rooms. Right from the start O'Donell had been amused and worldly about the research. This shocked me. He was a scientist and serious about studying behavior and here he was taking a casual attitude towards the mushrooms. The hell with all this phony talk and measurement business, let's get the mushrooms and start swinging. O'Donell was talking along this way, hard-boiled and cynical and then he popped the question that brought me up short, why don't we have some mushrooms right now? Big Charlie had been hear- ing all this mushroom talk for days and he jumped at this suggestion. Hey, that's a great idea. Let's try them out tonight and see what happens. I had been lecturing all year on research philosophy and ethics and how you should be collaborative and not use your position as a scientist to get an unfair advan- tage and about sharing information and sharing the power to make decisions with the subjects. And that was the way we had set up the mushroom research. Collaborative all the way.

Everyone taking turns at giving mushrooms and taking them. Now O'Donell's suggestion that we take the pills without the rest of the team present complicated everything I had been saying and the agreement we had made with the rest of the group. Besides, it will be a useful pilot study. We can try out a small dosage and see what happens and pave the way for a better session Sunday. That's right, said big Charlie, well be guinea pigs for the rest of them. O'Donell was looking at me coolly. Goddammit, don't be so square. You'll ruin the whole mushroom business if you try to make it rigid and organized and scheduled. In life you're either spontaneous or you're nothing. Spontaneous. That was some word. About two weeks before, I had been standing around at a cocktail party in Middletown and composer John Cage walked up and asked if I wanted to try his mushrooms and I laughed and thought it was a joke, kidding about my mushroom obsession, and I said sure and he led me out into the kitchen and there on a plate were some sliced and broiled mushrooms, delicious with butter and salt. John told me about the fun of mushrooms ordinary non- trance mushrooms that you eat, and how spon- taneity was the key. You could go to a forest glade for ten days in a row and not see a mushroom and then on that eleventh day (or it might be the first day for you ) there they are, the mushrooms, push- ing up through the soil so fast you can see them growing. The magnificent intersection in space- time, you and the mushrooms. And you have to be there at the exact hour because if you're a few hours late then you're too late and the rot has set in or the insects have started eating them. It's the spontaneity, the planless meeting, the thing you can't push or hurry. \"Not a single word about the positive unconscious. No attempt to help the pa- tient to open himself up to the life force or the Buddha nature. What troubles you? Why hesitate? Why is your heart oppressed by cowardice?

The last thing in the world I wanted to be was a worrying square and the last thing I wanted to put down was spon- taneity, so I worked out the quick compromise in my mind that I'd give them the mushrooms and let them have the experience but I wouldn't take them and so maybe I'd protect my contract with the absent researchers. \"And no attempt even to teach him to be a little more conscious in his everyday life. . . .

I parked in the front of the office and went in for the pills. I came back out to the car carrying a glass of water and it was agreed that everyone take two pills right away in the car so that the high could start building up on the way home. The literature on mushroom research suggested using doses of 8 milligrams, and each pill was 2 milligrams, so that when they took two pills they were taking half of a normal dose. O'Donell suggested starting slow with half a dose and then taking the rest later if it was going well. There was no reaction in the car and after we were settled in front of the fire, O'Donell and big Charlie and Joan took two more, and after an hour when the effect was working hardly at all, Joan took two more and Charlie and O'Donell took three more and I took two myself. The dosage for the group was 4 milligrams for me, 12 for Joan and 14 for Charlie and O'Donell. After about an hour and fifteen minutes it started to hit. Charlie started seeing the room in wonderful technicolor and be- gan to pace up and down through the house raving about the beauty, the texture, the delicate shades. His wife Rhona .was watching him amused and a bit scared. Charlie was an ex-football guard, not an intellectual person and never sensitive to beauty. Here he was moving around possessed, chanting poetry about the shadows on the rug and the subtle play of light on the wall. I was lying on the couch feeling good from the mood and the two pills and urging Charlie on and laughing happily at him. Joan came over and \"These people just leave the unfortunate neurotic to wal- low in his old bad habits of never being all there in present time.

That left poor O'Donell alone. In the molecular structure of the psychedelic group the lone atom whirls out of orbit. He was the only one not going along with the happy spirit. Face black with frown and wild-eye look. He was engaged to a girl in Seattle and missing her a lot and sick with love and loneliness and worry about the romance and he seemed to be falling apart under the mushrooms. Everything gets intensified lover or loneliness. O'Donell was sitting next to me on the couch muttering and letting out weird laughs. He turned to us and smiled an evil sort of smile and spit on the rug. Now under any circumstances this is a show-stopper, the sudden violent act smashing through the social fabric. But under mushrooms shock comes even stronger. Underwater calm and bliss shattered by rude spit. He had our attention all right. Our eyes were riveted to him as he reached down and took a package of cigarettes. He began to shake the pack- age so that the white cylinders fell into a crazy pile on the coffee table. Again, like the spit, it was nothing more than a slight eccentric gesture but sent a creepy chill running through me. O'Donell turned to me with the weird grin. Order. Order. Down with order. Again I felt the chill. Everything was going so mellow and smooth and the mushroom peace was so fine that I was surprised to see O'Donell getting worked up. Noth- ing seemed important at the moment except the loving calm. The idea that people worked them- selves up, worrying about things, little things espe- cially, was amusing. O'Donell, I said, it's all great. I had a girl and he didn't. He looked at me strangely and took his fist and pounded it in his hand and kept twisting it and turning his fist in his hand. Then he got up and walked to the bathroom and I could hear him urinating. Joan was thirsty, the mushroom thirst, the dry throat of visions, so I went to the kitchen.

But also that I was glad it had happened because we had learned a lot. First of all about the dosage. It was clear that the articles in the scientific literature were way off. The psychi- atric studies had been using four and five pills. Here we had Joan taking six and just feeling cozy. And here was Charlie taking seven and just getting sensitized to beauty and not coming anywhere near the deep visions and the falling down through the floor, through the earth surface down into the well of time the way we did in Mexico. And the second thing we learned was timing of dosage. People could start with moderate amounts, like two or three pills, and then increase the dosage at their own speed so that they could control it themselves and not be suddenly clobbered by a big first dose. And then too it was obvious that ob- servers could take small doses as well so that they could go along part of the way with the visionary voyagers. I explained to Mike that it was inevitable that Charlie and Rhona be made part of the group eventually. We couldn't keep them out of the mushroom scene taking place on the premises. Mike remained disapproving, wrenching every drop of guilt from the dark raisin of my remorse, but after I apologized he was touched and at the end he wrung my hand in forgiveness. After Mike left, O'Donell came by my office and I told him about Mike's punitive wrath. He nodded cool and wise. Sure. Sure. I understand the whole thing. It's those damn research meetings we've been having. Everyone gets all worked up. Anxious. They want to take the trip and they are scared to take the trip. The whole research business is fake anyway. There's too much fear around. This society is run on fear. Research is a phony ritual to counteract fear of the mystery. We should keep this thing secret. Have a good time with these mush- room pills. Learn with them. You can't research ecstasy except on yourself and your friends. And all this collaborative research bullshit. How are you going to collaborate or have a good time with people who are afraid of fun and ecstasy and keep using science as a defense?"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"October 1960 00 79 I knew he was right. It was some residual con- formist, prudish cop-out feeling of mine to want to have ecstasy above ground. To make the joyous mystery public and socially acceptable. It was hard for me to accept the fact that you can't surrender to God's grace and win a Sunday school merit badge at the same time. Another thing, said O'Donell, there's the power thing. Mike was sore because we went ahead last night without him. Well that's the way it's going to be. Everyone who isn't tripping himself because he's too scared or tired is going to resent our doing it. Sex, drugs, fun, travel, dancing, loafing. You name it. Anything that's pleasurable is going to bring down the wrath of the power-control people. Because the essence of ecstasy and the essence of religion and the essence of orgasm (and they're all pretty much the same) is that you give up power and swing with it. And the cats who can't do that end up with the power and they use it to punish the innocent and the happy. And they'll try to make us look bad and feel bad. Yeah, and they can make it sound bad too. Can't you see the headlines they could have written about last night's trip? profs lure girls to drug parties. Or how about this one profs, coeds nabbed in drug raid wasn't that what Mike was doing to your head? I said, well, we are supposed to be scientists and we used the drugs last night in an informal social situation. We gave the drugs to our friends. Drugs! Listen to that word. Drugs! This country is hysteri- cal about drugs. That word is a symbol more powerful than sex or communism. To the average American the word drug means doctor-disease or dope-degenerate. But underneath, everyone knows that the key to the mystery of life is chemical. The Elixir. The magic potion. The Holy Communion. The alchemist's powder. And everyone who wants to keep the status quo going is alarmed by the word drug. I was thinking of Lola, the Mexican maid, running across the lawn crossing herself in fear, fear of the mushrooms. I was feeling fear in a double dose. From within and without. The fear of taking the trip and going 5. The subject will be al- lowed to bring a relative or friend to be his observer. 6.

And the fear of the wrath of the control people who were opposed to others' taking the trip. I was climbing on the tightrope I was to walk for the next seven years. I was scared by the freedom O'Donell was defending. And afraid of the prudish social forces which attack freedom. Every participant who writes up a report receives copies of all other reports after completion of his own. This procedure increases the feeling of collaboration and, we believe, leads to frank description. A second source of data are questionnaires filled out by each subject. There is a third source of data: ratings executed by observers who watched the subjects and interviewed them during and after the experience. In a time of darkness it is essential to be cautious and reserved. One should not needlessly awaken overwhelming enmity by inconsiderate behavior. In such times one ought not to fall in with the prac- tices of others; neither should one drag them cen- soriously into the light. In social intercourse one should not try to be all-knowing. One should let many things pass, without being duped. ( I Ching ) Any psychedelic session confronts you with para- doxes that man has struggled with for thousands of years. And this innocent little trip proposed by O'Donell had been a four-year college education. It destroyed my hopes that the mushroom pill was an automatic love-revelation pill. This was a disturbing discovery. There seemed to be equal amounts of God and Devil (or whatever you want to call them) within the nervous system. Psychedelic drugs just open the door to the Magic Theatre, and the stages and dramas you encounter depend on what you are looking for, your state of mind when you begin, the pressure of your travel- ing companions. The terrible truth began to dawn and, no, I didn't want to face it that our consciousness cre- ates the universe we experience. We are the archi- tects of the celestial and hellish stages we act upon. I began to get a sinking feeling. Psychedelic drugs didn't solve any problems. They just magni- fied, mythified, clarified to jewel-like sharpness the basic problem of life and evolution. I began to feel the frustration of the guy who invented the wheel at that horrid moment when he real-ized it could be harnessed to any damnable human game to a war chariot, to a bulldozer, to a Las Vegas roulette table.

I remember lots of people coming all the time and turning on, and uh, I re- member doing things with the people. I was thirteen years old at the time. We had an enormous house, and uh, there was a huge living room with a shaggy green rug that looked like a field of grass. And a sort of music room. We lived in this beautiful house sort of like a mu- seum. The house was in a big stir of excitement when I got home. The great Halloween party was in the works. Ten teen-age boys and nine girls. The girls were going to stay over for a slumber party. They were busy stringing up orange and black ribbons, creative over joyous, and trying out the record player and fixing each other's hair and giggling about costumes and boys. We were all whipped up into a pre-party frenzy and it didn't help when some parents, whom I had invited to come for a drink after the party, appeared beforehand expect- ing to be entertained. Gradually the house began to fill up with sailors and tramps and clowns and pickaninnies and Japa- nese geishas and the adults assembled in the kitchen to keep out of the way. We had ordered two roast chickens but no one was hungry so we sat around the kitchen table putting away the Scotch and listening to the noise from the front rooms. My tension kept building up. No sleep the night before, of course, and the moral donnybrook with Mike at the office and then I had to rush out to interfere when my daughter started fighting with her brother, who had burst a girl's balloon. And when we expected the party to settle down to dancing, it turned out that teen-age boys don't dance and the girls huddled disgustedly in the dining room near the record player while the boys started a football game in the living room, tackling any girl who got caught in midfield without inter- ference. Just about at the point when the whistle should be blown I raced out of the kitchen and broke up three scrimmages and got everyone assembled in the dining room and sitting down for entertainment, except that we hadn't figured out any entertainment, and there were the twenty faces waiting intently to be entertained. 84"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"November 1960 00 85 O'Donell and I got all the girls into the living room and told them to hide. And then we went into the dining room and gave the boys paper bags to put over their heads and told them to hunt around blind in the living room until they found a girl and then to sit on the couch with her. Well the game went like wildfire and why not since we had har- nessed the strongest motive of all to make the wheels go round. For the next fifteen minutes we stood in the living room catching the lamps as they fell and umpiring the action and listening to the screams and giggles. When the last girl was caught a big cheer went up and then the girls said that they wanted to catch the boys and the whole act was repeated and when the last boy was caught they all screamed that they wanted to try it again and the boys went into the dining room and we started helping the girls to hide. The atmosphere was reeking of teen-age excitement, really indecent in its fervor, and when one flushed girl came up breathless and asked the name of this wonderful new game I told her, honey the game isn't really so new. It's as old as life and she said, well, we do need a name for it and I said we'll think of a good name sooner or later. Now about four or five of the girls had just blossomed within the last few months and this didn't lower the temperature. They kept wanting to hide up on the ledges of the bookshelf and kept calling to O'Donell and Charlie and me to help boost them up and they kept falling back on top of us and we were struggling to lift them up and hold them from falling and then the boys came in and the screams commenced and O'Donell and I tot- tered back to the kitchen and poured a Scotch and looked at each other. At eleven the boys departed and we got the nine girls herded upstairs to the master bedroom and set up the TV and the record player and good nights all around and back to the kitchen. The three of us, Charlie and O'Donell and I, were sitting around the kitchen table catching our breath and then the parade began. The girls kept coming down for hot chocolate and cookies and milk and ice cream. The girls were still flushed and wound up and couldn't It was rented from a very rich professor who had traveled around the world collecting material objects and they were very beauti- ful.

I remember he was very big and tall, looked like a gigantic mountain of teddy bear. I came to about his waist. Much of the time I was not involved in what was going on in the house. I had my own social scene with kids in Newton. But I remember him being around the house, like a Santa Claus laughing. leave that kitchen alone. There was one long-legged girl in particular who was wearing pink underpants and a green sweater and she stood by the electric mixer waiting for a milk shake and kept pulling the sweater down over her underpants and when she let go the sweater snapped up and then she pulled it down and it snapped up and then she pulled it down and it snapped up. She made four trips to the kitchen and finally I asked her in a nice way to go back up and put on her overcoat or something. Charlie and O'Donell and I were trying to carry on a conversation and finally I called a curfew on the girls' kitchen visits and we went back to serious drinking. We were all three tired and drawn out to a fine edge and the whisky was relaxing and we fell to discussing the mushrooms and the big moral struggle of the day. Good old solid Charlie was shocked and angry at the moral abuse we had taken from Mike. O'Donell had some creative theories explaining why they always persecute us. He was taking all the blame for the informal session. He was very nice. The more we talked the more righteous I became and the madder I got at the moralists. Alcohol stirs up the emotions. Of course, the more I agreed with O'Donell, the more guilty I became about my re- sentment towards him and my blaming him for the session. So we were swinging along in the most cheerful style and then the question came up again. O'Donell said, well, why don't we have a mush- room or two just to see what a small dose would do. Now this sounded like a good experiment. And after all the turmoil, it seemed only just and true that we three comrades should cement our alliance with a touch of revelation. It so happened that I had the bottle in my pocket. I could feel it there every time I reached for matches. I pulled it out and we each took two. Charlie started again on his mushroom litany. They produced paradise, and oriental beauty, and he was twenty-two years old and had never dreamed that such heavenly bliss was available to mankind. I was out of cigarettes and when I asked Charlie for a Marlboro he grinned and said, sure,"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"November 1960 00 87 but it will cost you a mushroom. Good enough. I poured out a pink pearl and handed it to him. When I asked for a light he proposed the same bargain and then I realized more clearly the power- control position I had set up for myself. That moment in my office when I had taken the brown cardboard box from Mike and put it in my file, I had changed my relationships with everyone I dealt with. They all wanted the bread of dreams, the flesh of the gods. And I was changed with the one ring of power in my pocket. I was feeling that miserable pleasure of the millionaire. There was always the ploy behind the ploy. Can I tap him for nirvana? Can I work him for a vision? There was one easy way out. Look, Charlie, let's stop all the playing around for the mushroom power. I have the ring of power. But I don't want it. I'm getting rid of it. I'm giving the precious mushroom bottle to you. Here, take it. Now you're stuck with it. Now you decide who gets them and how many and when. Let them come to you for the word. You decide. You dispense them. You take the responsibility. I handed the bottle to Charlie and laughed at his big football face bewildered by my move. I felt great. The load was off my shoulders. Mushrooms had taught me this much, that the artificial differ- ences between people, like age or role or prestige or control of the money or the land or the army or the mushrooms were irrelevant. I was damn glad to get rid of the role that I had put myself in holder of the indole ring. Less shame, my guide said, would wash away a greater fault than yours has been, my son. There- fore be unburdened of your sorrow. Remember, I am always at your side. ( Inferno VII ) And another poet I remem- ber is Allen Ginsberg. I remember I was watching television in my room one night and my father was running a session down- stairs. I was watching a movie; the airplane movie where the airplane catches on fire. What's the name of that movie? It was the one where the wing catches on fire and they throw all the luggage outside. While I was laughing and enjoying my new release Charlie was whispering to O'Donell and then he began pouring them out in his hand, all of them, the whole bottle, pink-pearl cluster in his big hand and he counted out eight, a third of the total and handed them to O'Donell and then he pushed eight with his big finger into his right hand and Allen Ginsberg was down- stairs and my father would come up now and then to report."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"88 00 Beyond the Good and Evil Game And I remember one point, my father coming up into my room and saying that Allen thought that Kennedy and Khrushchev should have an LSD session to- gether and end the Cold War. So Allen got on the phone and I remember my father was worried about the phone bill, so Allen Gins- berg called Jack Kerouac instead. I remember an Easter Sun- day, 1961, Alan Watts the philosopher was running a session, very Christian. They took LSD in goblets and read from the New Testament.

O'Donell said, you carry the heaviest body weight so you deserve it, and down it went, the last pink-pearl pill. I was still holding eight in my hand. I was again surprised at the way Charlie and O'Donell were treating the mushrooms. They were applying the liquor ritual to this new commodity. We're hung up always on the rituals we've learned, and the old drinking pattern of bottoms up and share the supply was operating and at this moment you were either with it or you weren't. Besides, I had given the responsibility to Charlie. I was free so I threw the eight pink jewels into my mouth. To speed matters up O'Donell suggested that we chew them. Sweet chalky taste and we washed them down with Scotch and waited for the next scene. From all the literature I had read on the subject, we had just surpassed the world's record for psilo- cybin consumption. The psychiatric people had been using 8 to 10 milligrams (that is, four to five pills), and I had just consumed 20 milligrams (ten pills) and so had O'Donell, and Charlie had wolfed down 22 milligrams. It hit in about twenty minutes, the waves of sensation rippling down the body and the pressure on the ear drums. There were six doors to the kitchen and they were all closed. We were sealed in a bathysphere plunged down to sea bottom. The walls and ceilings glowed phosphorescent yellow, electric vibrating color. The floor was shimmering like lemon Jell-o. Some torn fragments of party decoration were scattered on the floor and they sparkled, dazzling, black shiny ebony jewels. Orange gems. Some kid had left a cardboard top hat and Charlie tilted it on his head. His face was huge, yellow-stained with deep green shadows under his eyes. He had grown in stature, the leader, the keeper of the mushrooms. Top-hatted ringmaster of the cosmic circus. Chuckling, grinning impishly.

He was the wisest and funniest person I had ever seen. O'Donell the rebel was in a good mood too. We were three kitchen conspirators. Three gods romp- ing around a spangly paradise. There were only the three of us in the yellow-walled universe. No one else existed but this rolling trinity. Then over the laughter I heard a noise, a door opening upstairs and a blast of rock-and-roll from the record player, and then the door closing and silence. Oh yes; from a thousand years back I remembered the party and the girls' slumber-group upstairs on that other dis- tant planet. Vague angst. Are they all right? Are they doing well a million light-years away up there? Yes. Don't worry. Don't take the interstellar trip up there to see. ...

On the left of the stairs a huge oaken door closes off the dining room. On the right an archway leads into an enormous living room dimly lit. A small door leading into the kitchen is shut. The floor and stairs are covered with a deep-piled rug, no, it is really a desert expanse of sand. A wide stream of brown sand silently runs down the stairs and flows into a shifting pool on the hallway floor. The top half of the front door is set in polished diamond, three feet by five feet, flashing intense glass light. The woodwork and closet doors are carved ivory, solid, bone smooth and cool to the touch. A light green silk covers the walls and in the fabric are thousands of yellow diamonds in the form of fleur de lis gleaming. A golden picture frame out- lines a large rectangular hole in the wall.

He has a long, thin, dirty white beard which trembles as he breathes. An elongated Greco nose and deep-set eyes watching steadily, now frowning, now smiling, now turning down to the illuminated manuscript on which his hands rest and along which his slender fingers move. His thin pillar body is covered with the red folds of an episcopal robe, and his arms in yellow-white lace. He is watching, waiting, judging, preparing to render verdict. On the opposite wall there hangs a four-foot Moroccan mosque lamp, burnished gold, pierced over its entire swollen surface with filigreed lace- work designs. Inside the lamp, behind orange, red, and green glass, burn three bulbs spilling colors over the wall, setting fire to the green silk and reflecting from the embedded, flowered diamonds. The sand below the lamp is littered with piles of gems ruby, emerald, orange-diamond which have dropped down through the latticed holes. Spotlights flood the stage with changing waves of color. Under the sand floor is an electric generator which emits a steady hum and charges the atmos- phere with high- voltage currents. For centuries there is no action, only the cardinal moving his thin fingers across his scrolled pages and breathing softly. Then, The kitchen door opens. Enter Charlie, pagan leader of rebel gang. He is nine feet tall, a moun- tain man with a huge meat-red face glowing with energy, grinning, chuckling over some rebel- triumph, eyes dancing. His black top hat is tilted. He doesn't walk. He soars in leaping, floating steps to center stage, looking around in pleased admira- tion. He turns and beckons to his two followers. Enter O'Donell and Leary. They are small, wiry, happy rebels.

The bearded cardinal has frozen, two-dimensional against the wall. Three Beckett clowns on a vast, empty stage. Pointlessly milling around. We used to have a lot of visitors come, and people staying for the weekend, and some staying for pe- riods of time. It was not the normal, it was not like my friends' home life. Well, my friends weren't aware that my father was conducting LSD experi- ments. They just figured that my father had a lot of friends coming and going all the time. I heard O'Donell saying something about the teen-age girls upstairs. I frowned. Bad thought. Keep the other planets out of the action. Charlie tilted his top hat down over his eyes, giggling at O'Donell. No point in thinking about girls, O'Donell, you're impotent under the drug anyway. O'Donell scowled. Oh yeah. That's what you think. Talk about your own impotency but it doesn't hold for me. I may turn them on. Charlie grinned. What would the girls' mothers think if they knew there were drugged men roving around the house. The girls have never been safer, I said. All the reports say that the drug turns sex off. Charlie laughed. That's right. Last night I could look at Rhona and Joan and they were beautiful but I had no lust and didn't even want to touch them. O'Donell loosed a mocking laugh. The scene bothered me. I was feeling disjointed and rudder- less. I felt a longing for someone loving. I missed Joan and wanted to hold her close. Charlie and O'Donell were arguing and the happy mood was lost. Life is pointless without love, I said. We're straggling, lost on an endless desert stage. It's all meaningless, but we have to do something. O'Donell leered. Speak for yourself. I'm going upstairs. It was crystal clear to me that life without love is an empty sham, senseless action, puppetry. But we have to do something. What had any point? I tried to use my mind, but there were no categories, no cliches, nothing inferential to hold on to. All love- less actions were ritual. Empty gestures. Where, where is the real right program? What, what to do and why? Where to begin? How to build up a life of loveless action? I was standing in the hallway with my eyes closed trying to find a philosophy, a way, a meaning. What is life about anyway, with- out love? I was pushing my mind back, back to some beginnings, to something basic.

Yes, that's the beginning. Everywhere there is helpfulness and then we try to help. Yes. There's a difference that makes sense. It is better to help than hurt. The house is in a mess from the party. Rhona will have to clean it up tomorrow. I'll do it tonight. That makes sense. I'll start with the kitchen. Charlie and O'Donell were still bantering sar- castically at the foot of the stairs. The only loveless action that makes sense is to clean up the mess, I said. Matter of fact, that's a form of love. Come on out and help me. I left them and walked into the kitchen and started running water in the sink and rinsing dishes. The door opened and Charlie walked in. O'Donell's gone upstairs. Upstairs? I thought of upstairs and I thought of the girls and the slumber party. Waves of guilt washed over me for having dragged my kids around from country to country, school to school, house to house, and Susan missing friends and the warm cozy routine schedule and this was her first party, her first social event, and how excited she was and nothing must mar it, no clowning-around adults. Upstairs? Where did he go upstairs? To bed. I turned from the sink and looked at Charlie. My voice was harsh. Are you sure? Charlie's face reacting to my rough tones. A look of terror. Yes, well, I'm sure . . . that's what he said. My voice ominous. Well, I gave you the pills and it's your party and you're responsible. More terror. Gee, I'll go upstairs to check. I stood by the sink thinking again about the dear, naive, tender daughter, wanting so much a normal stable growing up. I dried my hands and started upstairs. In the upper hallway I could see the door to the girls' room open and Charlie's voice com- manding. I was sick with the horror of it. O'Donell, drugged, lurching into the slumber party. Scandal. Susan's dream of social acceptance shattered. The girls were standing in the center of the room bug- eyed. O'Donell was lying on their bed. Charlie was bending over him pulling his arm. Come on They were not aware until the Harvard business was publicized. Well, um, I'm sure they no- ticed something unusual about it, but I never dis- cussed it with them.

Mr. Blask: May it please the court. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. I, too, would take a moment to express for Mr. Susman and myself appreciation for the pa- tience with which you have listened to the testimony of the last two or three days. To say that this was an un- usual case would be gross understatement, and to say that it's an important case would be gross understate- ment, because, ladies and gentlemen, I have partici- pated in what I feel is a considerable number of criminal cases and I cannot remember a case that I have felt more strongly about than I have this case, and I will tell you why: Because we are dealing to- day in and you will be dealing with it when you are deliberating with a man who lives in your so- ciety. He may not live in your community but he lives here in the United States. He is no different than any- body else. Just because he may believe in a different religious aspect, that has nothing to do with it, or because he may be of a different race, that has noth- ing to do with it. O'Donell, let's go downstairs. O'Donell's mocking sneer. Nah. I doan wanna go downstairs. I'm gonna stay here with the girls. Charlie had pulled him up to a sitting position. Come on, O'Donell, you can't be in here. Nah. Who says I can't. I do what I like. I grabbed his other arm and we yanked him to his feet. O'Donell tried to throw us off but we held on. Come on, O'Donell. We don't belong here. This is the girls' party. Look at Susie.. You love her, don't you? Do you want to spoil her party? I looked at Susan. She was watch- ing us silently, curiously. We pulled O'Donell out the door. He was struggling but not too hard. We hustled him to the other end of the hallway and stopped. Goddammit, O'Donell, knock it off. You have no right to butt in there. Charlie and I were towering over him. He was shrinking back from us, his eyes glaring, his lips drawn back in animal rage. I had never seen such a visage of evil. He gnashed his teeth. He had shrunk in size and was crouching, possessed with malice. Shocking awful evil. Cornered rat, cornered rat was running through my mind. Neah. Neah. Mocking whine. Who are you to say what is right? Maybe I know what's right for those girls. Pampered middle-class dears in there watch- ing television and playing records, growing up to be miserable middle-class bitches. Maybe the greatest thing that can happen to them in their life is for me to stir them up a little. O'Donell's words hit my empty mind like hammer strokes. Stunned me. My God, maybe he's right. What reason, real reason do I have to inter- fere? It's my own dirty mind. I was racking my brain looking for a moral rebuttal. I was on Mars, you understand, looking down at earth, seeing in a flash the absurdity of social fears, taboos, the insane rituals that enslave mankind, the horrid middle- class fear. The fear. The fear. Did I want to descend to Main Street and protect tribal codes? Identify with the New England middle class? Share their insane terror of non-conformity? Their fear? I felt somehow that what O'Donell was doing was wrong but I couldn't tell him why. My mind had been purged of cliche and irrational belief. The"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"November 1960 00 99 beautiful, pure empty mind faced with the existen- tial moment. The moral crisis. Why shouldn't O'Donell do what he wanted? Who could tell in the long run whether his plan would or would not be good? He might be the sharp Zen master to shake the girls out of middle-class shackles. I turned, puzzled, to Charlie. He was standing, holding O'Donell's arm. His face was dazed. Tell him, Charlie, why he shouldn't go into the girls' room. Charlie stared at me. I ... I don't know why it's wrong for him to go there. I could tell that Charlie was going through the same moral search. Listen, Charlie. Don't you think it's wrong for him to go back in the girls' room? Charlie nodded decisively. Yes. I know it's wrong. Well, Charlie, tell him why it's wrong. Again the puzzled, helpless look. I ... I ... I can't tell him. I don't know why. I can't think of any reason. Plunged back into the cosmic vacuum. My mind ran through a hundred conventional, cliche reasons and rejected them. O'Donell was smiling with mean triumph. You see, you can't tell me I'm wrong. Do you want to set yourselves up as the great moral- ists? Telling me about your miserable shoulds and shouldn'ts. O'Donell made a move down the hall. Charlie and I grabbed him. Wait a minute. I know you shouldn't go there. I can't tell you why, but I know you're wrong. It was all perfectly clear to me. We were re- capitulating the moral struggles of the human race. We were the first and only men on earth and we were faced with the first ethical decision. Of course we could use force. Charlie and I the first cosmic police force could bend his arms and drag him the first and eternal criminal away and overpower him. By force. But why? What justification besides force? It was the first moral choice of my life. The first time I was faced with a fresh, ethical cross- roads. There was no learned, easy motto to parrot. Ethics had to be built right up from scratch and it had to be right not in terms of revealed dogma, or fear of punishment, but in terms of the basic issue. Now what was the basic issue? What is the un- assailable first assumption? Suddenly it came to me. Moses on the mountain. A beautiful bolt of Tight- ness. When we live here in this United States, every law that is written on the books applies equally to us and we must live by them. And the reason that this case is important and must be taken so importantly is because you are dealing with a man who has taken this stand during the time that he testified and told you, \"My name is Dr. Timo- thy Leary and that I am a psychologist, that I know it is wrong to possess mari- juana, but I know that there are certain ways that I can possess it legally and I know that if I had applied for such relief that I proba- bly would not have been granted it because they would have conducted in- vestigations up in Mill- brook.\" And he tells you that de- spite all of these things, \"I am more than the law: I am Dr. Timothy Leary and the law does not apply to me.\" And that is why this case is so important, because he is not above the law. None of us are."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"100 00 Beyond the Good and Evil Game Congress enacted these laws in this book and they enacted the laws concern- ing marijuana because they felt that it was an immense danger and that is why it was there. Congress also recognized that there are uses that are good for marijuana but that in order to experiment with it, as he says, or to research with it, as he says, he is a researcher, you must be li- censed. And the government will not allow somebody irresponsi- ble to be licensed. And I think that he is irresponsible and I believe that is why he could not be licensed and had never made an applica- tion for it. What about the facts in this case? He has admitted to you that he smokes marijuana. He told you that in 1964 or 1965, the first time he ever touched marijuana was in India. Ill tell you why you can't go into Susans room. Because it is her trip, her territory, her party, and because she doesn't want you there. You have the right to do anything you want to so long as you don't lay your trip on anyone else. No one has the right to force himself on someone else against his will. I was speaking slowly with the greatest seriousness. When I finished, Charlie shouted, Yes, of course, that's exactly right. You can't go there because the girls don't want you. Do your own thing. Let them do their thing. Tremendous flood of relief. The first ethical law had been forged. Moses smiles. There was a right- not based on force, not based on fear, not based on irrational taboo or custom or dogma. But based on cellular equality. Mutual respect. Charlie and I were nodding at each other happily. O'Donell was making a mocking growling noise and suddenly he burst out of our grasp and started down the hall. We grabbed him and pulled him back and around the corner to the north wing of the house far away from the girls. O'Donell was seething with futile rage. Again the rat-face and fangs, and his face even seemed gray and furry. We stood there blocking his way, argu- ing. You're cops. All cops are the same. Telling me what I can't do. Charlie and I were reasoning with him. Why don't we go back downstairs and have fun the way we were? Charlie was pleading. He had been swayed by O'Donell's violent rebuttal. We got no place. We were spoilsport, busybody policemen and O'Donell was going to have his own way. What can we do? Charlie was looking at me pleading. Suddenly I felt a moral impatience with Charlie. He was no longer the wise, Olympian clown god. He was a whining, begging boy who had talked me into giving him the pills and caused all this mess. Goddammit, Charlie. See what you did giving out the pills that way? I never wanted you to start this mess. You were the big shot and it's your responsi- bility. Now Charlie was mad. Oh? It's my responsibility, is it? Well, I quit! I resign! You're twice my age and you're twice as smart as I am and you handle it. I"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"November 1960 00 101 quit! Charlie dropped O'Donell's arm and started down the back stairs to the kitchen. Good, said O'Donell, all the cops quit and now I'm going back to see the girls. O'Donell started down the north- wing hallway and Charlie was moving down the stairs. I was panicked. I could follow O'Donell and leap on him and wrestle him back, but I feared the noise. I was obsessed by the dread of disturbing the girls. Fear of a scandal. I called down the stairs. Now I was pleading. Okay, Charlie. It's not your responsibility. But as one friend to another, as one human being to another, will you help me keep him away from the girls? Charlie looked up in my eyes. We both under- stood. Responsibility and roles were nonsensical and Charlie had been right to see through this and reject it. Under the mushrooms there aren't roles and rituals. But the appeal to him as man to man couldn't be dismissed. Charlie bounded back up and ran to the corner of the hall. He grabbed O'Donell's arm. O'Donell snarled and tried to push past. Charlie laughed, ominous, confident. Oh, little man, you want to get rough with me. Football Charlie was a giant pushing back the tiny foe. Don't try to pull any force, O'Donell, because that just won't work. The three of us standing in the north-wing hall- way. O'Donell sunk in bitter passivity. He was still muttering about cops. Need for someone present who was not under the drugs. We were still the only three men in the universe and we needed help. Then I thought of Rhona. Charlie, go up and wake Rhona. Tell her we need her down here badly. Charlie nodded and started down the hall. He walked sheepishly and I shouted to him ( again sore about his giving out the mushrooms irresponsibly), Ah, hah, you're guilty, aren't you? I was happy to see him guilty at waking his wife and exposing her to this drug mess. I was happy because it made me right and him wrong. Rhona's face was pinched and sour. She was blinking at the light. I was glad to see her. Rhona, a terrible thing has happened. She was cool and businesslike. What's so terrible? I explained the situation. First of all, you must realize that the This is research? This is a man who tells you that \"I am above the law.\" What kind of a man are you dealing with? What kind of a man do you have before you here today? You have a man that says, \"I believe in bringing up my children the old-fashioned way,\" and the \"old-fash- ioned way,\" ladies and gen- tlemen, is to expose them to mari- juana, expose them to these other drugs that he has no right to dispense. And that is what we have here. Is that irresponsibility? I can think of no no other situation that can be more irresponsible. Mr. Fitzgibbon: If Your Honor please.

That's all there was, was something about a half an ounce. The question of the amount has nothing to do with it nothing whatsoever. What did this man admit to doing? Whether we take it at face value or not, he admits that he obtained the marijuana in New York; he transported it from New York to Laredo, Texas. He has admitted that. There is no question about it. He did not have the proper order forms. There is no question about that. But he won't get a license because he knows they won't give it to him and he secretes the marijuana. That is the responsible per- son for you. three of us have taken a bigger dose of these pills than anyone in the world. Rhona was still cool. So what's so bad about that? Then I told her about the scene in the girls' room and how O'Donell insisted on going back. Rhona listened thoughtfully and we were all watching her. She became the great judge and law-giver. Who says I shouldn't do what I want to do. But, teen-age girls! Susan's party! We were pleading our cases. Rhona listened. The hallway was shadowy, a dim cave deep in the underworld. We finished. Finally the silence breaks. Truth speaks. Of course you can't go in there, O'Donell! And his voice coming back, mocking Rhona's prim, proper British, Nyayah. Why can't I go in there? What law says I can't and who's law? My tight muscles loosened when Rhona had pro- nounced the verdict, but now they tightened again. Could she give a reason, a rule that went beyond the transient rules of the games that we all knew we didn't have to play? And the reply, cool and so convincing. Impos- sible to think of going in there, O'Donell. Grown- ups don't join pajama parties! It just isn't dore. Wham! What a judgment. What legal logic. Moses, take your stone tablets. Justice Brandeis, forget your Blackstone. Rhona's words. Pinnacle of legal reasoning. Rhona, just two years out of teen- age herself, knew the rule as relentless as Three strikes you're out. Adults don't infringe on the trip of the adolescent. I was swinging clear and happy. And loving Rhona. Admiration. O'Donell was stunned. You could see his tense squirming body begin to relax. Looking down at the floor. Nodding his head. We stood for a long time and then Rhona, briskly, case-dismissed, no-nonsense voice, said All right. All of you come down to the kitchen and I'll brew up some tea and cookies. The calm, sure voice of the British empire. Righto! Good show! Well done! Now let's have tea.

O'Donell made an impatient gesture and Charlie glanced at me and went down. I followed.

Now, I don't mean to shout, for shouting's sake, but I feel so strongly about this case and his acts that I can't help myself, and I hope that you will forgive me. But when anybody makes fun and thinks it such a joke to possess marijuana illegally I think it is im- portant and I think that you ought to consider it impor- tant and I ask that when you deliberate, you look at those counts two and three, and I think that you will find that he transported that marijuana against the laws of the United States; he did not pay the tax on it; that on count two, when he found out that that mari- juana was in his posses- sion, he knew it.

We walked slowly down. Then he took two steps and stood, playing with us. I looked back and saw the sly, one- up grin, lips drawn back from the teeth. When I turned the corner of the stairs there was silence and then slowly O'Donell came down. In terms of a human situation, one is handling toild, intractable people. In such a case one's purpose will he achieved if one behaves with decorum. Pleas- ant manners succeed even with irritable people. (IChingX) Rhona was putting the kettle on the stove. Hey, Rhona, go up and check on the girls, will you? All right. But why don't you men start cleaning up this mess. I was ripped apart with guilt over lousy-father irresponsible stuff and scared of O'Donell. He had a wild gleam and was muttering to himself and moving with a clumsy madman plod. I feared him and sensed the insanity and understood the in- sanity and his confusion and sympathized with the confusion. Why? Who makes these rules? And why? And why do they hurt and humiliate? He just didn't understand the social game and was going through motions that were meaningless. Rinsing dishes. He wasn't happy about it. We could hear him muttering and the dishes breaking. I felt a closeness with him. We were all prisoners in a concentration camp of our own making. Pushed and punished by senseless rules. I went over to get the garbage can and quickly leaned over to him. Two Jews in the Nazi prison. Look, I whispered, the whole world is crazy. The whole system is insane. But don't try to fight it now. Play along. We got ourselves into it. It's the only way. O'Donell shot me an understanding glance and nodded. Yeah, you're right, he whispered. We'll play it out.

When I came back Charlie was standing by the stove, hands on hips, smiling and shrugging his shoulders. Look! O'Donell, what are you doing? O'Donell was cleaning up the table. He had a big brown bag and was dumping everything in the garbage food, glasses, silver, cigarette lighter. The voice stopped him and he stood holding the bag, grinning. I took the bag from him and laughed. O'Donell just won't play the game. With that stupid look and moronic grin, he is making a joke of the whole business. It was kind of funny. Next the roast chickens, sitting on serving plates, untouched. O'Donell took an ashtray and dumped it on the first chicken. Don't throw ashes on My fresh roast chicken. There's no celestial housemaid. He was wrong. But why? In the great cosmic scheme of things why not throw silver in the gar- bage and ashes on the fresh roast chicken? Why? I stood there holding the garbage sack in my hands, brow furrowed. Why? Why not? Why? Then I understood. It's okay not to play the game if you are willing to deal yourself out of the game. Don't play house if you don't want to play house. But don't live in the house and expect the rewards of the house game. Yeah, O'Donell. Sure. Empty ashes on the chicken if you don't mind eating chicken with ashes. But don't infringe on others' games. Don't throw out Charlie's lighter and the family silver. And don't break up the teen-age girls' game. Break up. Destroy. I remember him slashing the lamp cord with the knife and spitting on the carpet. Suppose your game is destroy. I thought of all the poor kids who had been left out of the rich games they saw all around them. Why? Explain it. Why? Because some games, most games, keep others out. Not because the kid can't play well enough. Not because he isn't willing to learn. But because no reason. So they create the game of destroy.

Have had experience with mescaline, LSD-25, and psilocybin. The mushroom synthetic seems to me the easiest on the body physi- cally, and the most control- lable in dosage. The effects are generally similar, subjectively. Psilo- cybin seems to me to be some sort of psychic god- send. It offers unparalleled oppor- tunity to catalyze aware- ness of otherwise uncon- scious psychic processes. To widen the area of hu- man consciousness. To deepen reification of ideas and identification of real objects. To perceive the inner organization of natural objects and human art-works. By this time there was in existence an informal international network of scientists and scholars who had taken the trip and who foresaw the powerful effect that the new alkaloids would have on human culture. The members of this group differed in age, temperament, and had widely differing ideas about tactics, but the basic vision was common to all these wondrous plants and drugs could free man's consciousness and bring about a new conception of man, his psychology, and philosophy. There was Albert Hoffman, who had invented LSD, who dreamed the Utopian dream, but who was limited by the cautious politics of Sandoz Pharmaceuticals. What a frustrating web his genius had woven for Sandoz. How could a medical-drug house make a profit on a revelation pill? Sandoz knew they had patented the most power- ful mind-changing substance known to man. They spent millions to promote research on LSD. They righteously expected to make millions when the psychiatric profession learned how to use LSD, and they were continually disappointed to discover that human society didn't want to have its mind changed, didn't want to touch a love-ecstasy potion. In 1961 a top executive of Sandoz leaned across the conference table and said to me, LSD isn't a drug at all. It's a food. Let's bottle it in Coca-Cola and let the world have it. And his legal counsel frowned and said, foods still come under the juris- diction of the Food and Drug Administration. By 1966, when LSD was crowding Vietnam for the headlines, officials of Sandoz Pharmaceuticals were groaning, we wish we had never heard of LSD. 7 do really wish to destroy it! cried Frodo.

Why was I chosen? (The Lord of the Rings ) To enter the significance and aesthetic organization of music, painting, poetry, architecture. The story of Albert Hoffman, the secret behind his wise silence, has yet to be told. But for the moment he was uneasily forced to play the drug- company researcher game. There were the detached philosophers Aldous Huxley, Father Murray, Gerald Heard, Alan Watts, Harry Murray, Robert Gordon Wasson who knew that the new drugs were re-introducing the platonic- gnostic vision. These men had read their theological history and understood both the glorious possibility and the angered reaction of the priestly establish- ment. They were not activists but sage observers. Then there were the turned-on doctors psychia- trists who had taken the trip, and came back hop- ing to fit the new potions into the medical game. Humphrey Osmond, witty, wise, cultured, had in- vented the name psychedelic and tolerantly won- dered how to introduce a harmony-ecstasy drug into an aggressive-puritanical social order. Sidney Cohen and Keith Ditman and Jim Watt and Abram Hofer and Nick Chewelos hoped to bring about a psychiatric renaissance and a new era of mental health with the new alchemicals. And there was that strange, intriguing, delightful cosmic magician called Al Hubbard, the rum-drink- ing, swashbuckling, Roman Catholic frontier sales- man who promoted uranium ore during the 4o's and who took the trip and recognized that LSD was the fissionable material of the mind and who turned on Osmond and Hofer to the religious mys- tical meaning of their psychotomimetic drug. Al Hubbard set out to turn-on the world and flew from country to country with his leather bag full of drugs and claimed to have turned-on bishops and obtained nihil obstat from Pope John, and when the medical society complained that only doctors could give drugs, bought himself a doctor's degree from a Kentucky diploma mill and swept through northern California turning-on scientists and professors and God-seekers. It seems to make philos- ophy make sense. It aids consciousness to contem- plate itself and serve some of the most delightful func- tions of the mind. As if, turning up the volume on a receiving set, back- ground and FM stations can be heard. The effects are not unnatural. I have experienced similar things without use of chemi- cal catalysts, and corre- spond to what I, as a poet, have called previously aes- thetic, poetic, transcen- dental or mystical aware- ness. A kind of useful, practical cosmic consciousness.

I won't send you new names and work-trouble for awhile. Hope you can get these four letters off. I also wrote Osmond and Huxley asking them to con- nect Burroughs with Heim, or anyone in Paris. None of my business actually, but Koestler always struck me as a little /7arc/-hearted somehow. Hate myself to have him as a final curandero. That is, be- ing an intellectual, he tends to organize a polemic-dog- matic-mental system around experience. As in his essay on Zen, which is very intelligent, but not so magnanimous. But by all means send him batches to hand out. And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the spirit gave them utterance. And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, what meaneth this? Others mocking said, these men are full of new wine. Right from the beginning this dedicated group of ring-bearers was rent with a basic disagreement. There were those who said work within the system. Society has assigned the administration of drugs to the medical profession. Any non-doctor who gives or takes drugs is a dope fiend. Play ball with the system. Medicine must be the vanguard of the psychedelic movement. Capture the medical pro- fession. Cohen and Ditman and Al Hubbard and his two loyal, gifted lieutenants, Willis Harman and Myron Stolaroff, warned that any non-medical use of psychedelic drugs would create a new marijuana mess and set back research into the new utopia. The medical point of view made little sense to religious philosophers. Aldous Huxley called the psychedelic experience a gratuitous grace. His vi- brant flame-colored wife, Laura, agreed. So, in gentle tones, did Huston Smith and Alan Watts and Gerald Heard. And so did Allen Ginsberg, who had discovered the Buddha nature of drugs with Jack Kerouac and Gary Snyder and Bill Burroughs. I had been visited by most of the psychedelic eminences by this time and was under steady pres- sure to make the Harvard psychedelic research a kosher-medically-approved project. Everyone was aware of the potency of Harvard's name. Timothy, you are the key figure, said Dr. Al Hubbard; I'm just old deputy-dog Al at your service. But the message was clear: keep it respectable and medical. And now here was Allen Ginsberg, secretary general of the world's poets, beatniks, anarchists, socialists, free-sex/love cultists."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"December 1960 00 113 The sunny Sunday afternoon that we gave Allen Ginsberg the mushrooms started slowly. Rhona and Charlie were down in the kitchen by nine to start a cycle of breakfasts. First there were Jack Leary and his friend Bobbie who had spent the night. Bobbie went off to Mass. When I came down I found Donald, an uninvited raccoon hipster-painter from New York solemnly squatting at the table gnawing at toast and bacon. Frank Barron and the poets, Allen Ginsberg and Peter and Lafcadio Orlovsky remained upstairs and we moved around the kitchen with that Sunday morning hush not want- ing to wake the sleepers. Lafcadio, Peter's brother, was on leave from a mental hospital. About twelve-thirty the quiet exploded into fam- ily noise. Bobbie was back from church where he excitedly had told his father about the party we had given the night before for the Harvard football team and how I had given the boys, Bobbie and Jack, a dollar each for being bartenders. I toted up the political profit and loss from this development. The Harvard football team rang up a sale. But the boys bartending? Bobbie's father is Irish so that's all right. All okay. Then wham, the door opened and in flooded Susan Leary with three teen-age girls, through the kitchen, upstairs to get clothes, down to make a picnic lunch, up again for records, out and then back for the ginger ale. By now the noise had filtered upstairs and we could hear the late sleepers moving around and the bathroom waters running, and down came Frank Barron, half-awake, to fry codfish cakes for his breakfast. And then, Allen Ginsberg and Peter. Allen hopped around the room with nearsighted crow motions cooking eggs, and Peter sat silent watching. After breakfast the poets fell to reading the Times and Frank moved upstairs to Susan's room to watch a pro football game on TV and I told Allen to make himself at home and got beers and went up to join Frank. Donald the painter had been padding softly around the house watching with his big, soft creature eyes and sniffing in corners and at the bookcase and the record cabinets. He had asked to take mushrooms in the evening and was looking So H.S. fears the peril of mind let loose. Well I agree with you generally. But I have had that experience of absolute fear. Suppose it decides not to keep the body going? In Peru. It never recurred, but I can't guarantee it won't recur to me. That is, there was some- thing mysterious happening beyond what I know and later experienced. Each in- carnation is different. But at the time I was sure that if I really let go I would literally die, and that it might be a good idea. To get another dimension. But I wasn't so positive it was a good idea. Really fearfully confused. Maybe you could die, like a yoga or Buddha or something worse, or better? Who knows?

I wrote Huxley his address today with an explanatory note but if you have any means of connecting him with Heim or anyone there could you do so. for records of Indian peyote drum music. We told him to phone around to the local libraries. A friend of his, an anthropology student, could possibly locate some Indian records, and could he borrow the car and go to Cambridge? All his words came up halting, labored, serious, and I said sure go ahead. During the game, Jack Leary and his pals came in dressed in their football uniforms and watched the action for a while and then got bored and went up to the third-floor playroom. We kidded them about getting suited up like pigskin warriors and then sitting around inside and not playing. After the game Frank Barron rounded up Charlie and the boys and we went out behind the garage and had a game of touch football. The poets declined to play. At dusk we came in and started a long kitchen Sunday supper scene, cold ham and meat pies, highballs ( but not for the poets ) . It was an agree- able kitchen chaos with everyone puttering around. Rhona and Charlie were sick with stomach flu and headed upstairs early. Lafcadio had stayed in bed most of the afternoon until Allen had gone up to tell him to come down and he sat in the corner quiet, impassive, eerie, probably thinking wonder- ful thoughts about the Martians landing on earth. He nodded every time we offered him food, and Allen would tell him to put his plates away and he would obey silently and mechanically. After the meal we asked Jack and Bobbie if they wanted to play catch in the upstairs hallway with Lafcadio and they said sure and ran off with Lafcadio lum- bering after them. There are ball marks on the white ceiling to this day and the wall lamp has never quite worked the same, but Allen said that the weekend was tremendous therapy for Lafcadio. He started talking more and it kept up for several weeks after they left. Allen Ginsberg, hunched over a teacup, peering out through his black-rimmed glasses, the left lens bisected by a break, started telling of his experi- ences with Ayahuasca, the fabled visionary vine of the Peruvian jungles. He had followed the quest of Bill Burroughs, sailing south for new realms of consciousness, looking for the elixir of wisdom.

Then the village Pucalpa, and the negotia- tions to find the curandero, paying him with aguar- diente, and the ritual itself, swallowing the bitter stuff, and the nausea and the colors and the drums beating and sinking down into thingless void, into the great eye that brings it all together, and the terror of the great snake coming, lying on the earth floor helpless and the great snake coming.

The fate of fire depends on wood; as long as there is wood below, the fire burns above. It is the same in human life; there is in man likewise a fate that lends power to his life. ( I Ching L ) I kept asking Allen questions about the curan- dero. I wanted to learn the rituals, to find out how other cultures (older and wiser than ours) had handled the visionary business. I was fascinated by the ritual thing. Ritual is to the science of con- sciousness what experiment is to external science. I was convinced that none of our American rituals fit the mushroom experience. Not the cocktail party. Not the psychiatrist. Not the teacher-minister role. I was impressed by what Allen said about his own fear and sickness whenever he took drugs and about the solace and comforting strength of the curandero, about how good it was to have someone there who knew, who had been to those far regions of the mind and could tell you by a look, by a touch, by a puff of smoke that it was all right, go ahead, explore the strange world, it's all right, you'll come back, it's all right, I'm here back on familiar old human earth when you need me, to bring you back. Allen told me about the training of curanderos. Perhaps send him an aca- demic letter of introduction which he could deliver to Heim? This got to be done soon, as Burroughs is on way East in a few weeks I think not sure. He writes he had some LSD in London, as well as an injection of another drug what, I dunno. He writes Don't flip pops is all. One must be careful of altitude sickness and depth mad- ness and the bends. Haz- ards of the silent world.

Then he was equipped to act as curandero, to take care of visionary travelers, to understand the words and behavior which con- fuse and frighten the unprepared observer. Allen told of the therapeutic impact of the kind village doctor as he went through the age-old rit- uals of caring-for the hand on the shoulder, and cup of hot tea and the covering with blankets. I remembered back to a session when a lonely gradu- ate student fell to the carpet in anguished panic, and how Frank Barron the veteran front-line medic took over with cold compresses and kind words, and how the student never forgot his being there, doing the right thing at exactly the right time. Allen was going to take the mushrooms later that night and he was shaping me up to help him. Allen was weaving a word spell, dark eyes gleaming through the glasses, chain-smoking, moving his hands, intense, chanting trance poetry. Frank Bar- ron was in the study now, and with him Lafcadio Orlovsky. Then a car came up the driveway and in a minute the door opened, and Donald, furry and moist, ambled in. He had brought his friend, an anthropology student from Harvard, to be with him when he tripped. Donald asked if his friend could be there during the mushroom session. I liked the idea of having a friend present for the mushrooms, someone to whom you could turn at those moments when you needed support, so I said sure, but he couldn't take the pills because he was a University student.

He was thinking hard about basic issues and it was obvious what was going on with him clearing his mind of abstractions, trying to get back behind the words and concepts, suddenly, however, realized they WERE ALL IMAGINARY REINGS I WAS INVENTING TO SURSTITUTE FOR THE FEAR OF REING MYSELF THAT ONE WHICH I HAD DREAMED OF. And if he succeeds in assigning the right place to life and to fate, thus bringing the two into har- mony, he puts his fate on a firm footing.

Look, operator, I'll have to go upstairs to get the number. Then I'll call back, he said, i don't WANT TO DIE. Allen hung up the receiver. What was all that about, Allen? Well, the operator asked me my name and I said I was God and I wanted to speak to Kerouac and she said, I'll try to do my best, sir, but you'll have to give me his number and then I gave her the number of my mother's house. I've got Kerouac's number upstairs in my book. Just a min- ute and I'll get it. Allen hopped out of the room, and Peter the Hermit lit a cigarette. I took advantage of the time out to check on the third floor. Susan was sitting on the floor of the TV room sticking bobby pins in her curlers. Rhona was lying on the couch watching a program. Charlie said, Hey, what's going on down there? Allen says he is God and he and Peter are naked and are phoning around to Kennedy and Kerouac. Naked? Both of them? Rhona and Charlie giggled.

He wanted Jack to come up to Cambridge and then he wanted Jack's mother to come too. Jack had a lot to say because Allen held the phone listening for long spaces, i heard he WENT INTO NY AND DIDN'T DRINK FOR A WEEK AS A result. Charlie was standing with his feet apart watching. Frank was still sitting behind the desk smiling. Donald and the anthro student were stand- ing in the hallway looking in curiously. I walked over to explain, i had feeling if i weakened in energy the scheme would fail. Allen says he is the Messiah and he's calling Kerouac to start a peace and love movement. Donald wasn't interested. He went on telling me about the foolishness of believ- ing in hot and cold. It occurred to me that Allen and Peter were proving his point, if i ate or shit AGAIN I WOULD TURN RACK TO MERE NON-MESSIAH HU- MAN. The phone call continued and finally I walked back in and said, Hey Allen, for the cost of this phone call we could pay his way up here by plane. Allen shot an apologetic look and then I heard him telling Jack, Okay Jack, I have to go now, but you've got to take the mushrooms and let's settle this quarrel between Kennedy and Khrushchev, but NEEDED MY GLASSES THOUGH HAD YELLED AT LEARY THAT HE DIDN'T NEED HIS EARPIECE TO HEAR THE REAL VIBRATIONS OF THE COSMOS.

I don't think they'd let a call go through to him, Allen. Well, it all depends on how we come on. I don't think coming on as Allen Ginsberg would help in that league. I don't think coming on as the Messiah would either. Well, you could come on as big psychologists and make big demanding noises about the patient. It was finally decided that it was too much trouble. Still curandero, I asked if they wanted anything to eat or drink. Well, how about some hot milk. FROM PHYSICAL FEAR AND FEELINGS OF WANTING TO FORGET IT ALL AND DIE, SLEEP, EAT, SHIT, BE BACK human. Allen and Peter went upstairs to put on robes and I put some cold milk in a pan and turned on the stove. Donald was still moving around softly with his hands behind his back. Thinking. Watch- ing. He was too deep and Buddha for us to swing with and I later realized that I hadn't been a very attentive curandero for him and that there was a gulf between Allen and him never closed and that the geographic arrangement was too scattered to make a close loving session. Of course, both of them were old drug hands and ready to go off on their own private journeys and both wanted to make something deep and their own. Anthro's role in all of this was never clear.

He was to line up influentials and each weekend I would come down to New York and we'd run mushroom sessions. This fit our Harvard research plans perfectly. Our aim there was to learn how people reacted, to test the limits of the drug, to get creative and thoughtful people to take them and tell us what they saw and what we should do with the mushrooms. Allen's political plan was appeal- ing, too. I had seen enough and read enough in Spanish of the anti- vision crowd, the power-holders with guns, and the bigger and better men we got on our team the stronger our position. And then too, the big-name bit was intriguing. Meeting and sharing visions with the famous. The ritual was to be the curandero sequence. These people will have more confidence in you than in me, said Allen. The wise-guide ritual sounded good. The cause was right and the contract benefi- cial to all concerned. We were after all offering a free round-trip ticket for the greatest journey known to man. From this moment on my days as a respectable establishment scientist were numbered. I just couldn't see the new society given birth by medical hands. Or psychedelic sacraments as psy- chiatric tools.

Donald still seemed high and would walk in and out of the room, silently, hands behind his back, Talmudic raccoon, studying the kitchen crowd seriously, and then padding out. The anthropology student had joined us around the table. We had given him something to drink and he was listening to the conversation and saying nothing. He made some comment about schedules back to Cambridge and it was time for him to make the last train so I drove him down to the station. He asked some questions about the scientific meaning of the mushroom research and it was clear that he didn't understand what had hap- pened and what we were doing. There wasn't time to explain and I felt badly that he had been dragged into a strange situation. We had made the rule that people could bring their friends when they took the mushrooms and this seemed like a good idea for the person taking the mushrooms but it was just beginning to dawn on me that the problem never was with the person taking the drug but rather the people who didn't. Like Brother Toriblo the Spanish monk, who talked about cruelty and drunkenness caused by the Sacred Mushrooms. It's okay to bring a friend, but he should take the mushrooms with you. And poor anthro, it turned out, wasn't even a friend of Donald's and as it turned out didn't like him and he was clearly bewildered by and critical of what he had seen and heard and the nakedness of the poets. His train was about due and I was too preoccupied by what Allen had been saying to feel like explaining to anthro. The uneasy feeling persisted and I sug- gested that he not tell people about the mystic visions and the naked crusaders because this might be misunderstood and he said he wouldn't talk about it and we shook hands and he left.

I'll try to connect him with a toy manufacturer home- made optic movies possible. From this time on we saw ourselves as unwitting agents of a social process that was far too powerful for us to control or to more than dimly understand. An historical movement that would inevitably change man at the very center of his nature, his consciousness. We did sense that we were not alone. The quest for internal freedom, for the elixir of life, for the drought of immortal revelation was not new. We were part of an ancient and honorable fellowship which had pursued this journey since the dawn of recorded history. We began to read the accounts of earlier trippers Dante, Hesse, Rene Daumal, Tol- kien, Homer, Blake, George Fox, Swedenborg, Bosch, and the explorers from the Orient tantrics, Sufis, Bauls, Gnostics, hermetics, Sivites, saddhus. No, we were not alone. Nor were we isolated in the twentieth century. The three groups who always await and accept the revelation which comes in every historical time were present in full and goodly numbers. The young (who always want more and have no game to protect), the artists (who always hunger for the ecstatic moment), and the alienated (the wise slaves and noble minority groups watching from the periphery of the society ) .

The energies released by the sacred drugs were too great to suppress. We began to see it as a question of time. The movement would grow like everything organic grows, cell by cell. Friend turning-on friends. Hus- bands turning-on wives. Teachers turning-on stu- dents. The contagion of contiguity. The tissue underground. Shortly after Allen Ginsberg left, we made statis- tical predictions about the growth of the psyche- delic movement. We drew a cumulative percentage graph and hung it on the wall. The rapidly ascend- ing curve spelled out our forecast. In 1961, we estimated that 25,000 Americans had turned-on to the strong psychedelics LSD, mesca- line, peyote. (Marijuana we stayed away from.)

(It is no accident that the psychedelic movement by 1967 was a tribal phenomenon. ) At the rate of cellular growth we expected that by 1967 a million Americans would be using LSD. We calculated that the critical figure for blowing the mind of the American society would be four million LSD users and this would happen by 1969. We were wrong in our estimates. We were too conservative. By 1966 Life magazine announced that a million Americans were using LSD. In the spring of 1966, a million doses a month were being distributed by a messianic underground in Cali- fornia alone. By 1967 four million Americans had taken the trip. In June of 1967, an album by the Beatles which openly celebrated the psychedelic experience sold a million copies the first week of its release.

But all knowledge was not the same to him, nor was any thought as good as any other: he loved a cer- tain kind of thinking, and disdained and abominated the others. What he loved and revered was logic that so admirable method and, in general, what he called \"science.\" \"Twice two is four,\" he used to say. \"This I be- lieve; and man must do his thinking on the basis of this truth.\" Once there was a man by the name of Arthur Koestler who was painted within and without by Hermann Hesse. Whether his Sunday Telegraph manuscript needs any postductory remarks may be open to question. I, however, feel the need of adding a few pages, in which I try to record my own recollections of him. What I know of him is little enough, yet the impression left by his person- ality has remained, in spite of all, a deep and sympathetic one. A. K. devoted himself to intellectual pursuits. He had given up the novel as a medium of teaching, and had a wide range of knowledge. But not all knowledge was the same to him. Returning to his first profession, he said that any thought was not as good as another. He preferred science and report- ing. Science-reporting. He loved a certain kind of thinking, confessing to me that psychology was his first love, the profession in which he felt he could make his greatest con- tribution. He was rewriting an earlier book on creative thinking (new moves on the mind board) and disdained the mystical experience. Insight and out- look is what he called science once in a Franco prison. In 1959 he had visited India in search of truth and meaning. His reactions were typical of the Western rational mind overwhelmed and flipped- out by the seething, organic, seed squalor-beauty of this Holy Land.

Thus the two halves move away from each other, giving rise to the idea of conflict. ( I Ching VI ) He wrote a book about the East called The Lotus and the Robot, which was to become quite relevant to the psychedelic controversy. He held a low opin- ion, which explains the dark expectations which he brought to his psilocybin experiences. He congratu- lated himself on his rational mind. He was not really intolerant of religion. Although his given name Artha is Sanskrit for the acquisition of power, wealth, or fame, his cells remembered the paternal name.

Fooled by little pills for several centuries, Arthur Koestler disliked what he saw in the East, while his science embraced nearly everything that existed on earth. That was worth knowing. He said that both India and Japan seem to be spiritually sicker, the human soul more estranged and to tolerate more speculations on the soul, than the West. Arthur Koestler was a rational mind, tolerant long before Aldous Huxley found in yoga every- thing that Arthur Koestler recognized as supersti- tion. A remedy for our Brave New World.

However, on the day before I took the drug, I had a very unpleasant experience with the result that I faced the mushrooms in an anxious and depressed state. They come synthesized, in the shape of little pink pills. I swallowed nine of them (18 mg. of psilocybin), which is a fair-sized dose for a person of my weight. They were supposed to start acting after thirty min- utes. However, for nearly an hour nothing at all happened.

A.K. was coming to the U.S. and would like very much to come to Harvard and try the mush- rooms. A few days before his scheduled arrival a phone call came from New York.

Of all the surprises I had prepared for him, this was to be the most violent. For have no moment of doubt that it was I who brought this bird of paradise who was delighted to be our host at his special table at the Ritz Bar. So far, he said, I have control. That was fine. The schedule was : drinks at the Ritz, dinner at the Steel Helmet in Boston with the Frank Barrons, and then an evening at the Magic Theater for A.K. to observe a psilocybin session run under easygoing, suppor- tive circumstances for madmen only. To put on a good mushroom ritual, I had wired up to Charles Olson, our father who art in Glouces- ter. The giant Olson, genial guru, father of modern poetry. Unfortunately it is a habit, a vice of his, always to speak his mind, as indeed Goethe did in his better moments. A few years previous he had retired to a rocky promontory overlooking the harbor whence he served as guide and friend to our work. Olson dominates any gathering with his size, his wit, his intellect, his noble stature, his wise animal energy. He was striving for redemption but it will take him all his time. He was the person, surely, to introduce Arthur Koestler to the open- brain and its ecstatic possibilities. On the way to the Ritz, A.K. told us of two dear friends of his, Moses and Jehovah, who had re- searched mescaline in Berlin during the twenties. Their psychedelic sessions kept opening up more and more realms of experience and revelation. Dr. When I closed my eyes I saw luminous, moving pat- terns of great beauty, which was highly enjoyable; then the patterns changed into planaria a kind of flat- worm which I had watched under the microscope the previous day in a labora- tory; but the worms had a tendency to change into dragons, which was less enjoyable, so I walked out of the show by opening my eyes. I tried it again, directing the beam of the table-lamp, which had a strong bulb, straight at my closed eye- lids, and the effect was quite spectacular rather like the explosive paintings of schizophrenics, or Walt Disney's Fantasia. A flaming eddy, the funnel of a tornado, appeared over my head, drawing me up- ward; with a little auto-sug- gestion and self-dramatisa- tion I could have called it a vision of myself as the prophet Elijah being taken to Heaven by a whirlwind. But I felt that this was buy- ing one's visions on the cheap (Carter's mushrooms are the best; mystic experi- ence guaranteed or money refunded); so I again walked out of the show by forcing my eyes to open. It was as simple as that, and I congratulated myself on my sober self-control, a rational mind not to be fooled by little pills."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"144 00 You Have to Go Out of Your Mind DIFFERENT LOOK By now, however, even with open eyes, the room looked different. The colours had become not only more lumi- nous and brilliant, but dif- ferent in quality from any colour previously seen; they were located outside the normally visible spec- trum, and to refer to them one would have to invent new words so I shall say that the walls were breen, the curtain darsh, and the sky outside emerdine. Also, one of the walls had ac- quired a concave bend like the inside of a barrel, the plaster statue of the Venus of Milo had acquired a grin, and the straight dado-line was pleasantly curved, which struck me as an ex- ceedingly clever joke. But all this was quite un- like the wobbling world of drunkenness, for the room was plunged into an under- water silence, where the faint hum of the tape re- corder became obtrusively loud, and the almost im- perceptible undulations of the curtains became the Ballet of the Flowing Folds (the undulations were caused by the warm air ascending from the central- heating body).

They tried to tell others about their dis- coveries but no one would listen, neither their colleagues nor their families. Mighty Dr. Jehovah and Dr. Moses, with a dark and fiery eye and the stride of Wotan, finally got to a point where they could only communicate with each other. I saw them pray at the edge of the Red Sea. Flipped-out together they had a rapport and high pitch of understanding in Handel's wonderful duet for two basses in which this event is magnificently sung. To the rest of the world they were hopeless eccentrics. So strange and incredible to be looking on at all this. A.K.'s medical friend suddenly seeing sacred peyote writ, with its heroes and its wonders, the source in our childhood of the first dawning suspi- cion of another world than this, presented before a distasteful public that sat eating the provisions brought with it from home. Finally the social pressure was too great and they cracked under the strain. A nice picture, indeed, picked up by chance in the huge wholesale clear- ance of culture in these days. Jehovah went to Mexico where he died in short time. Moses, with dark and fiery eye and a long staff and the stride of Wotan, went to Munich where he was treated by a monster of a psychiatrist who failed to understand him. My God, rather than come to such a pass, it would have been better for the Jews and everyone else, let alone the Germans, to have perished in those days, forthwith of a violent and unbecoming death instead of this dismal pretense of dying inch by inch that we go in for today. Quitting treatment, the friend returned to Berlin and killed himself. At the Ritz the neurologist was waiting at his special table.

This lowering of the sensory threshold and simultaneous heightening of the inten- sity and emotional signifi- cance of perceptions, is one of the basic phe- nomena of the mushroom universe.

Dr. P. came into the room, and a minute or two later I saw the light and realised what a fool I had been to let myself be trapped by his cunning machinations. For during that minute or two he had undergone an unbelievable transformation. Arthur Koestler made a quip about their mutual European background which the psychiatrist avoided. A.K.'s eyes, wolf of the steps, narrowed, and mild dislike grew quickly to strong distaste. Couldn't stand a person who denies his racial past. A long anatomical argument began.

A.K. surfaced to lob glances of resignation our way. Keep quiet with your questions and chatter, said the neurologist. I'm a professor of theology, if you want to know. But the Lord be praised, there's no occasion for theology now, my boy. It's war. Come on. Then Koestler's face grew tense. What did you say your name was? he asked the neurologist. Ah. And did you ever have a patient by the name of Dr. Moses? No. He remembered no such patient. Moving in like a cross-examiner, A.K. sketched in more details about his friend, about his problems, his history, his appearance dark and fiery eye and a long staff and the stride of Wotan. Slowly the neurologist remembered. Oh yes, now that you remind me, I do seem to remember treat- ing the case. Treat him, indeed, retorted A.K. sternly.

Then the Barrons arrived, Frank poised and cheerful and his new wife, Nancy, radiant and bouncing. On and on went their nuptial dance. God knows where the girl got her voice; it was so deep and good and maternal. Obediently I shut my eyes, leaned my head against the wall, and heard the roar of a hundred mingled voices surge around me. After another drink we moved to leave the neurol- ogist. Outside, the air coming off the Boston Com- mon was clear and fresh. We had all escaped from an especially grim mental hospital. Somewhere we heard a door bang, a glass break, a titter of laughter die away, mixed with the angry hurried noise of motorcars starting up. We felt close to- gether after the ordeal and drove to the North End for seafood. You're ready? Far up in unhuman space rang out that strange laugh. A.K., bubbling with spirit, ordered wines and made a gallant scene with Nancy. When we arrived back at the house, Charles Olson was in the kitchen leaning over, talking to young Jack Leary, his back to us. I brought A.K. up to Olson. The giant poet turned, looked down at the small figure of the novelist, and beamed out of his jolly eyes that really were animal's eyes, except that animal's eyes are always serious, while his always laughed and turned into human eyes. Olson was holding a toy pistol in his hand. Arthur Koestler's eyes went up, up, up to look at Olson and then dropped quickly to the pistol. He paled and pulled back. There he stood face-to-face with what he feared. Olson roaring out genial greetings. Brother Harry, I invite you to a little entertainment. For madmen only, and one price only your mind. Are you ready? Coats removed, the group assembled in the study. Why then was Hermine so white? Why was Pablo talking so much? A low built-in couch ran along two sides of the room, intersecting at the corner. A large round table strung people out in the form of a circle. Highballs. We planned the session. My friends, I have invited you to an entertainment that Harry has long worked for and of which he has long dreamed. Olson and Leary and Barron and a Harvard It started with the colour of his face, which had be- come a sickly yellow. He stood in a corner of the room with his back to the green wall, and as I stared at him his face split into two, like a cell dividing, then reunited again, but by this time the transformation was complete. A small scar on the doctor's neck which I had not noticed before, was gaping wide, trying to ingest the flesh of the chin; one ear had shrunk, the other had grown by several inches; the face became a smirking, evil phantasm. Then it changed again, into a different kind of Hogar- thian vision, and these transformations went on for what I imagined to be sev- eral minutes. All this time the doctor's body remained unchanged; the hallucinations were confined to the space from the neck upward; and they were strangely two-dimen- sional, like faces cut out of cardboard. The phenome- non was always strongest in that corner of the room where it had first occurred, and faded into less offen- sive distorting-mirror ef- fects when we moved else- where, although the light- ing of the room was uni- form. The same happened when other members of the staff joined us later. One of them, the jovial Dr. F., was transformed into a vision so terrifying a Mongol with a broken neck hanging from an invisible gallows that I thought I was going to be sick; yet I could not stop myself staring at him. In the end I said: For God's sake let's snap out of it, and we moved into another part of the room, where the effect became weaker."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"148 00 You Have to Go Out of Your Mind As the last remark indi- cates, I was still in control of my outward behaviour, and this remained true throughout the whole three or four hours of the experi- ence. But at the same time I had completely lost con- trol over my perception of the world. I made repeated efforts \"to walk out of the show\" as I had been able to do during the first stages on the couch, but I was powerless against the delu- sions. I kept repeating to myself: But these are nice, friendly people, they are your friends, and so on. It had no effect whatsoever on the spontaneous and in- exorable visual transforma- tions.

The hour is late and no doubt we are all fatigued. Nancy Barron and Nunez and Rhona were to act as ground control. So first we will rest and refresh ourselves a little. A.K. would observe. From a recess in the wall I took a quaint little bottle, also a small oriental box inlaid with dif- ferently colored woods. We were sitting around the table and the pills were counted out for each voyager. A.K. had gotten over the shock of meeting Olson and the toy pistol and was in fine spirits, watching intently. When the last person had taken his potion, A.K. reached over and said, Let me go along too. He took ten tablets and washed them down with his drink. So he did, perched on his stool, while the dance went on around us to the lively strain of the strings. The ship cast off. We sat listening to the hi-fi. Its effect was en- livening and delightful. Light conversation. Olson was spread out over the couch, center of a giggling admiring group, as though one were filled with gas. We who had shared the psychotomimetic cocktail session at the Ritz and had no longer any gravity were reviewing the day's events quietly. The soft peace of the mushroom began to descend. Jangled, racing minds began to purr smoothly. Every moment we felt ourselves growing lighter and more serene. The few words spoken were concise Zen Koans, questions answered in the asking. From far away came Pablo's warm voice. A candle flame on the circular table flickered softly saying, It is a pleasure to me, my dear Harry, to have a Spanish guitar concerto, pure notes of thin steel and the privilege of being your host in a small way on this occasion. Olson played gestural games with a sofa cushion. A quietly circling thread of closeness wove us to- gether. You have often been sorely weary of your life. When eyes met, they sent rays of amused understanding. You were striving, were you not? So here we are. Born and dying together. A longing to forsake this world and its reality.

Moving in like a cross-examiner, A.K., haunting eyes and furrowed face-skin, was supporting the weight of the universe. Bach's ivory ping-pong balls drowning out, his lips moving rapidly. I help you to make your own world visible. That is all. He puffs and pants up the steep path groaning. But no one is listening. Rhona and Lynn giggling fondly at Olson's bridges of silence.

This struck me as obscene, more so than four-letter words, in the WRONG KIND Poor Dr. P. and his nice colleagues had to endure what they would call a \"negative transference,\" and serve as projection screens for the lantern slides of the past, stored in the mental underground. Thus I was a rather unfor- tunate choice for a guinea pig except perhaps to demonstrate what mush- roomland can do to the wrong kind of guinea pig; and I suspect that a sizable minority of people who try for a chemical lift to Heaven, will find themselves landed in the other place. I do not want to exaggerate the small risks involved in properly supervised experi- ments for legitimate re- search purposes; and I also believe that every clinical psychiatrist could derive immense benefits from a few experiments in chem- ically-induced, temporary psychosis, enabling them to see life through their pa- tients' eyes. But I disagree with the enthusiast's belief that mescalin or psilocybin, even when taken under the most favourable conditions, will provide artists, writers, or aspiring mystics with new insights, or revelations of a transcendental nature. I profoundly admire Aldous Huxley, both for his philos- ophy and uncompromising sincerity. But I disagree with his belief that drugs can procure \"what Catholic theologians call a gratui- tous grace.\" Chemically-in- duced raptures may be frightening or wonderfully gratifying; in either case they are in the nature of confidence tricks played on one's own nervous system."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"150 QO You Have to Go Out of Your Mind NO MERIT I think I understood the rea- son for this when I took the mushroom the second time, under more happy and re- laxed conditions.

We all took various amounts of the pill, and this time I took a little more (either 22 or 24 mg. for I lost count).

AN ANSWER In \"Heaven and Hell,\" de- fending the mescalin ec- stasy against the reproach of artificiality, Huxley, the most highly respected ex- ponent of the cult, argues that, in one way or another, all our experiences are chemically conditioned; and that the great mystics of the past also worked systemati- cally to modify their body chemistry . . . starving themselves into low blood sugar and a vitamin de- ficiency. . . . They sang interminable psalms, thus increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the lungs and the bloodstream, or, if they were Orientals, they did breathing exercises to accomplish the same pur- pose."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"152 00 You Have to Go Out of Your Mind There is, of course, a cer- tain amount of truth in this on a purely physiological level, but the conclusions which Huxley draws, and the advice he tenders to modern man in search of a soul, are all the more dis- tressing: \"Knowing as he does . . . what are the chemical conditions of transcendental experience, the aspiring mystic should turn for technical help to the specialists in pharma- cology, in bio-chemistry, in physiology and neurology.\" I would like to answer this with a parable. In the be- loved Austrian mountains of my school days, it took us about five to six hours to climb a 7,000-foot peak. Today, many of them can be reached in a few min- utes by cable-car or ski-lift, or even by motorcar. Yet you still see thousands of schoolboys, middle-aged couples and elderly men puffing and panting up the steep path, groaning under the load of their knapsacks. When they arrive at the al- pine refuge near the sum- mit, streaming with sweat, they shout for their tradi- tional reward a glass of schnapps and a plate of hot pea-soup. And then they look at the view and then there is only a man and a mountain and a sky. quire concerted unity of forces. Conflict within weakens the power to conquer danger without. (IChingVI) My point is not the virtue of sweat and toil. My point is that, although the view is the same, their vision is different from those who ar- rive by motorcar. 00 The next evening on the way home A.K. bought two bottles of French wine, chosen with care, a flask of Scotch, and, gently from behind clenched teeth, asked: And if I do not submit? We sat in the library starting to work on the whisky. K held up his glass and shook it with an icy tinkle. And if I deny your right, Mozart, to interfere with the Step- penwolf, and to meddle in his destiny? I'll stick to my drug. Alcohol is a social stimulant. It warms you up; brings you closer to people. Mushrooms are non-social. They whirl you inside. Bring you closer to yourself. Give me alcohol any day. Oh, dear Arthur, I'm bound to say I thought you had learned the game better. Next day as we walked into the airport building at Logan field to see him off, A.K. made his final comment. You must admit that these drugs cause psychosis. A temporary psychosis. I'm bound to say, Harry, you broke through the humor of my little theater. A benign and educational psychosis, if you will. Would you say it's therapeutic? Therapeutic. Of course. That's what the effect should be called. ttp. instant mysticism. Temporary therapeutic psychosis.

Would I? Pablo was waiting for us both. And Mozart too. I drove back to Harvard and went by Frank Barron's office to tell him about my disappointment. Why hadn't we been able to turn-on Arthur Koestler? Frank pulled at his chin thoughtfully. Koestler was lonely last night. Koestler is a man and a man needs a woman.

It was becoming glaringly obvious that extraordinary sexual energies could be released. Frank was right. God and sex are the two central beats of the dance. The mind muffles and disguises the reality tune. Blow the mind and you are left with God and life and life is sex. This was obvious in my first trip in Mexico- languorous Mandy melting and the deep lingering of the Cherokee princess, Betty. Whenever trouble appeared in a session, it meant isolation from God and mate. The fear, the confu- sion, could always be calmed by prayer or loving fleshly contact.

After their second session they separated and she married the man whose image she brought back from her psychedelic trip. It was almost inevitable that the guide of the session would be seen as God and lover. When the mind is suspended you project on the calm person who has turned you on, all the attributes of divinity and eternal malehood. We called this process of new attraction-repul- sion re-imprinting. The persons you turned-on fell in love with you or never wanted to see you again. I have never met Arthur Koestler since his trip. Allen Ginsberg has been my soul brother since his trip. In the first two months of our Harvard psyche- delic research seven women followed me home- much as the baby ducklings followed Conrad Lorenz and announced their love. For many reasons I was not ready in 1961 to face the sexual potentials of psychedelic drugs. I was awed and confused by the sexual power. It was too easy. I was too much an Irish Catholic, too prudish to deal with it. Too Western Christian to realize that God and Sex are one, that God for a man is woman, that the direct path to God is through the divine union of male-female. Besides, I was still involved in being a scientist. Too weighted by the duties and responsibilities to enjoy the newly opened paradise. I was too much an intellectual. I wanted to understand before plunging in. I felt a moral obligation to Harvard University a good place on this dark planet.

The rigidity of the normal mind was so different from the complete openness and vulnerability of the psychedelic situation. This suggestibility, which had obvious implica- tions for brainwashing, conversion, sudden behav- ior change, was illustrated in Richard Alpert's first session. I woke late that morning.

The drifts in the driveway were two feet high and three feet by the garage door. We were snowbound. After dinner Jack ran into the room, smiling and shouting. Guess who's here! I could hear Sue yip- ping in pleasure and when I got to the hallway, there was Dick Alpert with an arctic coat and fur gloves and boots plastered with snow, hugging the kids and filling the house with good feeling. We all trooped into the kitchen and stood him on a chair and Sue broomed off his trousers and Dick shouted, No sir, Jack, don't use the toilet brush. We were all laughing. Later Dick and I were sitting at the kitchen table drinking beer and talking about the sacred mushrooms. Dick was fascinated by the psychedelic research and eager to join. The first step for him was, of course, to start his own training. Learn how to explore the rooms of his own consciousness. When? Why not start now. Now? Are you ready? When I got up from my chair, he said, Oh, you really mean right now, and I said, Whenever you take them it's right now. I came down with the bottle and counted out six and poured them in Dick's hand and said, Chew them, and without pausing in the story he was telling, Dick popped them in his mouth. They taste great. Then he went on with the story. I took six, and a few minutes later Charlie came in grinning expectantly and re- fused politely twice before taking his six. They hit me first and fast. The eerie physical chill Room beginning to glow Talk becoming underwater Gurgling. About fifteen minutes later Dick started to look silly and happy and Charlie's big pink cheeks began to radiate, and the gray green under his eyes, and we were all roaring with laughter, high, happy, drunken eagles.

But why has he taken so long? He's been gone for hours. I looked up at the clock hands which had moved five minutes in the last eight hours. Psychedelic time. He's gone from present time so he's been gone for centuries. The door opened and we both looked up hope- fully. Charlie! Surge of relief. Where the hell have you been? I went upstairs to take a leak. But why did you take so long? Long? I was gone for two minutes. Psychedelic time. Jack was back with Champ the dog. Champ had been a nuisance all night. Romping with the cat. Barking when Jack teased him. Knocking over the cat's milk bowl. Too much big, brown, romping animal in crowded kitchen. Twice Rhona had put him down in the cellar, and twice Jack had indig- nantly brought him back. Charlie was mad at Champ for leaving a turd on the guest-room rug. When Jack went upstairs, I put Champ outside. Dogs love the snow. Dick and I went back to mushroom talk. Enter Jack, accusing. Where's Champ now? We put him outside to run in the snow. Jack went out the hallway scolding us. The snow must have looked good to him. He announced that he was going to go out and run in the drifts with Champ. He went to get dressed and then was back with us, booted and gloved and his hood over his face, beaming with pleasure.

Heartbreak- ing great scene. Boy, dog, snow, satori. We were back on the Buddhist-humor jag. I was telling Dick the history of the mushroom research and the people wanting to get high for science, or to do science in order to get high, and I men- tioned the name Jack and right then the door opened and there was Jack, thumping off snow, ready to enter stage left, and I helped him get off his coat and gloves and I zipped down one of his boots and found it stuffed with snow and I zipped it right back up again and said, Take this snow back to the fellow what made it, we don't want it here, and everyone laughed and Jack said, Come on Dad, and Jack started telling his snow saga, how the drifts were higher than Champ and how Champ would disappear in the snow and how hard it was for poor Champ to jump from one hole to the next drift. Champ had Jack's sock in his mouth and when Jack pulled it out there was blood on the sock. We were alarmed but Jack calmed us down. Oh, that's nothing, I bleed all the time. When we heard this we began to laugh. Jack was pleased by the laughter but embarrassed. He shouted, Here Champie, Champie, come on Champie, and ran into the living room and when I came to ask him, Where do you bleed all the time, he was running round and round the long sofa chasing Champ. When we all got back to the kitchen I sat down. From behind the chair there came a fast panting series of whooshing sounds. What's that queer noise? Jack shrugged. Just Champ breathing hard. He's tired. Exit Jack to watch TV with girls. Back to the mushroom tales. We were building up to un- bearable good humor, putting our heads on the table to control the bodyshaking chuckles. Then I found myself looking at the dog. Champ was lying by the sink. His face was drawn back tight and strained, teeth gleaming, horrible crazy grin, and his body was shaking in fast, frantic breathing. Horrid wolf leer. Eyes bulging. God, that dog is sick, look at him. Laughter stops. Wow, you're right. Look at him breathe. He's having a fit."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"February 1961 00 163 We were all leaning forward. Looks like the first stage of distemper to me. Champ lay on his side, ribs heaving, eyes glaring, lips pulled back. Maybe it's rabies, said Dick. Don't they froth and spit blood. Blood, yes, there was blood on the sock. Champ stretched his legs out stiff. Look, it's a convulsion. Charlie's calm voice. You're crazy. The dog's all right. He's just exhausted from running in the snow. Oh, yeah? Fatigue doesn't give a dog the fits. And he's been breathing heavy for ten minutes. I remember asking about that noise when he and Jack came back in. Has he had rabies shots? That's fatal to a human being if he bites you. Charlie's voice. For God's sake, let's drop the dog issue and enjoy ourselves. He's had shots. He's not sick. He's just trying to rest and catch his breath. I moved over near the dog. Here, Champ, come on boy. Champ wagged his tail weakly and got up. He walked slowly across the kitchen while we watched him in horror. His flanks were heaving with tortured gasps and when he got to the butler's pantry, to the far dark corner, he fell heavily and closed his eyes, the symptoms are initial fever WITH ITS ACCOMPANIMENTS, THIRST, LOSS OF APPE- TITE, HURRIED PULSE AND RESPIRATION. Boy, that animal is really sick, emaciation, lan- guor, disinclination to move. Go look and see if he is alive. Dick tiptoed to the pantry and poked his head around the door. He's still breathing hard. SOMETIMES THE LEGS ARE SWOLLEN AND THE ANIMAL IS STIFF. Charlie was laughing. You guys slay me. You're the end. Look what the drug does to you. You go around and make a big production of everything. THERE IS GREAT DISINCLINATION TO MOVE: THE BODY SWAYS ON THE ANIMAL ATTEMPTING TO WALK. YOU worry when I go up to pee and now about the dog. Let's not ruin the fun. The dog is fine. I've raised dogs for years. I know when a dog is sick and when a dog is tired. Dick tiptoed again to the pantry and peeped around the corner.

I walked over to look. Champ was lying in a gray, ragged heap. His head rested on the floor. His jowls hung down, the membrane lining the eyes assumes a dull leaden hue. His eyes gleamed in helpless, begging misery .v His sides heaved. You're right. IVe never seen anything so sick, but the CHARACTERISTIC SYMPTOMS ARE A GRAYISH YELLOW DISCHARGE FROM ONE OR BOTH NOSTRILS. Dick was looking intently into the pantry. God, look! There's mucus dripping from his nose. Mucus? Oh, he's dying. Mucus? Well, maybe it's just the breath from his nose, the discharge from THE NOSE ADHERES TO THE NOSTRILS AND UPPER LIP.

The rest of them were howling in laughter, too. clots sometimes FORM IN THE PLEURA OR HEART. It's SenOUS, you're right, he's terribly sick. Compulsive chuckles. I walked into the pantry. Champ was a limp, boneless mass on the floor. His bright, gleaming brown coat had changed to a gray-black drab. He seemed to have shriveled. His fur was moist and pulpy. THE SUFFERING ANIMAL ALWAYS APPEARS exactly as it is and feels. I put my hand on his tortured head and the eyes opened and the tail wagged feebly.

Puff, puff on pipe. I think we should wait and let nature take its course. He may pull out of it on his own. Dick looked very wise. I noticed Charlie stealing glances into the pantry. He was beginning to look worried. Sure. I know dogs. They get sick and crawl off to rest and don't want to be bothered and they sleep it off. He just doesn't want to be bothered. We can't do anything anyway, the con- tagious DISEASES OF THE DOG ARE FEW, BUT THE ONE WHICH ATTRACTS THE MOST ATTENTION IS COMMON AND GENERALLY SERIOUS. THIS IS WHAT IS POPULARLY KNOWN AS DISTEMPER. Someone had closed the pantry door but we couldn't close out the thought of the animal dying in the next room while we argued helplessly and giggled. I walked over to the door and pushed into the pantry, debility rapidly ensues and emacia- tion is soon apparent. I was sure that the brown body would be lying there stiff and cold. No, the bedraggled rag was pulsing softly. He was alive, but just by a breath. His eyes were blank and glassy. I came back to the kitchen and stood with my hand on the refrigerator. Well, what do you think? I frowned and spoke slowly, clipping my words. convulsions generally come on. The dog is sick, terribly sick and he'll be dead by morning. And I don't see one thing we can do about it drugs or no drugs, snow or no snow. A long silence followed, in FATAL CASES THE ANIMAL DIES IN A STATE OF MARASMUS.

I lay down next to Jack. His eyes were glued to the"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"February 1961 00 167 screen. When the commercial break came I started asking casual questions. No, he hadn't noticed any- thing wrong with Champ. Well, yes he had been breathing heavily. Were you worried about him? No. Are you worried now? No, well, a little if you're worried. Jack was watching the commercial and not very interested in talking. At the door I stopped. After the show is over, you guys come down to the kitchen. Sue nodded yes and blew a kiss to me, her eyes still on the TV. Downstairs Dick had the yellow section of the phone book in his hand, the rare instances in WHICH ANIMALS CAN RE SEEN RY THE VETERINARY surgeon. He was cross-examining Charlie. Logi- cally I know that Champ is all right. Maybe ex- hausted, but logically I'm convinced he's okay. Dick sighed in relief and reached behind to put the telephone book on the stove. But, emotionally, you guys have got me convinced that he's sick, in the EARLIEST STAGES OF THE DISEASE, AND WHEN THIS WOULD PROVE MOST AMENARLE TO MEDICAL TREAT- MENT. Dick's eyebrows raised and he sighed in pain and reached for the phone book. Well, let's get our boots on and carry him down to the avenue and get a taxi, delay usually due to THE INAHDLITY OF THOSE WHO HAVE CARE OF THE ANIMAL TO PERCEIVE THESE EARLY STAGES. What a scene.

Noise from the pantry. Death convulsions. Champ struggling to his feet and walking slowly into the kitchen. Hardly enough strength to move.

Come on old fellow. Good dog. Champ broke into a run, and his tail was wagging a mile a minute and he was wiggling in delight the way puppies and happy young dogs do and he jumped up, two paws against Jack, and Jack was rumpling his ears and Champ's tail was waggling so hard that when it bumped against my leg it kind of hurt and Susan shouted, Here, Champ, here, and the dog bounded across the room to her, squirming and wiggling, and I was staring with my mouth open and I looked over and saw the expression on Dick's face, stunned, and Charlie at the end of the table was grinning away in a disgusting smug manner and I began to laugh and Dick was laughing, all of us howling like idiots, and the kids looked up sur- prised and Susan began to frown her after-all- Daddy frown and I started to explain to the kids. Susan and Jack started laughing and by this time Champ was lying on the floor with a big bone grasped between his paws and was crunching and grinding away on it, his tail still wagging at all the noise and laughter. So we were back on the cloud again and we rolled along for another three hours. I told Dick"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"February 1961 00 169 more about our early adventures as scientists track- ing down the sacred mushrooms and we reviewed the great moments from past mushroom scenes and we were funny and wise to our hearts' content. At four o'clock Dick got his boots on and then stood for another hour rapping and laughing and we went to the front door and looked out down the long rolling front lawn all clean and glistening, and down at the trees hung heavy with white like a Christmas card etching, and Dick shook hands all around, grinning, and gave a shout and a big jump and started bounding down the snow slope and we stood watching him. When he reached the road below he waved up and we waved back. Lying in bed, I tried to figure out what we had learned that night. First the value of ritual. I was beginning to see that there are many ways that sacred mushrooms can be used. Your ritual decides. The basic man-woman love scene. And then the tribal fiesta scene. Like the one we had those nights in Allen Ginsberg's pad with Kerouac. Or the great tribal love feast with the Dionysius from Glouces- ter. And then there's the deep visionary heavy-dose experience in which you don't want other people around at all except for the wise loving curandero to guide you back when you want to return. And a second lesson. The size and shape of the room makes a difference. If we had been sitting in a line along the couch or scattered around the big living room, it wouldn't have swung so well. The idea of being enclosed together like in a sub- marine or in a spaceship or in the snowbound kitchen, pushed up close and facing each other around the table, closeness, intimacy, fighting the pull of the expanding disintegrating universe. When Beckett puts his characters on lovely wide beaches or deserted flat landscapes, he knows what he's doing. The separation and distance between his characters are heightened by the empty vistas. If you cram people together into smaller spaces, like molecules of gas, more heat generates in tighter quarters. And a third lesson. For group rites you need a love leader. A guru. A guide.

By devo- tion to this divine spirit within himself, he attains an unsullied innocence that leads him to do right with instinctive sureness and without any ulterior thought of reward and personal advantage. This instinctive certainty brings about supreme success and \"furthers through perseverance.\" ( I Ching XXV) And a fourth lesson, and this one not really understood yet the incredible suggestibility and the vulnerability of the brain. Under the psyche- delic trip your cortex is washed clean of the rituals and cliches. The empty mind. So far so good. But then if the situation or some strong-minded person in the situation strikes a posture, spins out an idea, well, you are much more likely to accept it and you can't call on any of your past cliches to argue yourself out of it. Jack Kerouac was right when he warned about psychedelic brainwashing. Once the concept of sickness-death was introduced, we all climbed into it and saw disease and pain. But what to do about this vulnerability? How could the trip be guided in the love-learning direc- tion? What could serve as compass to orient the session when consciousness spins out beyond sym- bols? How could reminders, maps be brought along on the voyage? And exactly which maps and re- minders could remain useful in those hurtling re- gions where routine game symbols were seen as your own consciousness talking back to yourself? The mocking mirror reflection of your own thought processes. The answers to these questions (which were to preoccupy me for the better part of the next six years ) are spiritual planning and prayer. Planning the who, where, when, and why and how of the session. You don't make love in the turmoil of Times Square. Neither do you take LSD there. It's risky to make love with strangers.

Alone or with essence friends who share your spiritual aims. Where? In a setting free from secular distraction, profane pressure, accidental interruption. Since the dawn of human history such places have been the center of any civilized God-fearing way of life. They are called shrines, sacred groves, retreats, temples, holy places. When? At a sacred time dedicated to the spiri- tual quest. A sacred time is selected not by man's mind but by the greater, older energies seasonal, solar, lunar, planetary, menstrual. Why? To find God. To divest all the leathery, metal, armor plating and lie naked, exposed, for God to find you. To die and be reborn. How? Through prayer. Prayer is the art of com- municative union with all your inner selves. Prayer is compass and gyroscope. Prayer is the language that makes sense to your eye, ear, nose, tongue, touch; to your heart ( thump thump ) , to your lungs ( inhale-exhale ) , to your bowels, to your genitals, to your ancient cells, to your ancient selves hairy, fanged, clawed, scaled, reptile, amphibious, proto- zoic. Prayer is the energy language of God. The history of our research on the psychedelic experience is the story of how we learned how to pray.

Applications to three of- fices of the U.S. Public Health Service requesting support for continuing this project were refused. Exactly two years ago the Harvard Psilocybin Project initiated a research pro- gram at Massachusetts Cor- rectional Institution, Con- cord, designed to test the effects of consciousness-ex- panding drugs on prisoner rehabilitation. The project was designed as a pilot study neces- sarily exploratory since little was known about the long-range application of the substances. During the fall and the winter of i960, much of my time and energy was going into the study of the effects of the psychedelic mushrooms. I was also carrying on an active program of lecturing, teach- ing, and field work in clinical psychology in the Harvard Graduate School. I had been brought to Harvard in 1959 in order to introduce existential- transactional methods for behavior change. After fifteen years of practicing psychotherapy and about ten years of doing research on psychotherapy, I had come to the conclusion that there was very little that one person called a doctor could do for an- other person called a patient by talking to him across a desk, or listening to him as he lay on a couch. I developed a lot of theories and a lot of methods on how behavior change could be brought about more effectively than the standard clinical interview method. There are two main points to the theories I de- veloped; first (transactional) I was convinced that the doctor had to suspend his role and status as a doctor, had to join the other person actively and collaboratively in figuring out the solution to his problem. As much as possible, the doctor had to turn over the responsibility to the man who knew most about the problem at hand, namely, the pa- tient. I developed many techniques for getting pa- tients to help each other. The second point in my theory (existential) was that the doctor has to leave the safety of his consult- ing room and get out there in the field where the so-called patient is having his unique problems, and where he is going to solve his problems. I saw the role of the doctor as that of a coach in a game in which the patient was the star player. The coach can help, can point out mistakes, can share his wisdom, but in the last analysis, the guy who does 174"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"March 1961 00 175 the job is the guy out there in the field, the so- called patient. I was enthusiastic about these theories because they worked, and because no joy in teaching can equal that thrill which comes when you watch someone who's been hung up, and blocked, and confused, and making a mess of things out there in the field suddenly learn how. All this had started happening before I got involved\" in the drug re- search, and I had already become a controversial figure around the Boston area, because everything that I was saying made a tremendous amount of sense to students and patients, but the doctors, the psychiatrists, the social workers, the professors, the psychologists, were not so quick to accept these theories. I was asking them to give up the status and the omniscient position which they felt their training entitled them to. I asked them to turn over the authority and the star role in the game to the patient. Times change, and with them their demands. Thus the seasons change in the course of the year. In the world cycle also there are spring and autumn in the life of peoples and nations, and these call for social transformations. ( I Ching XLIX ) The key issue was the use of a consciousness-ex- panding drug; but equally important was the philos- ophy underlying the re- search, which emphasized: DEMOCRATIC COLLABORATION: Inmates were given respon- sibility for planning and evaluating the work. This was seen as preparation for assuming roles as respon- sible citizens in a demo- cratic society. SHARING OF INFORMATION: The inmates were given all information relevant to their treatment. This was seen as a necessary step in in- creasing trust and self-re- spect. I was taking one day off a week to drive down with two or three graduate students to New Bed- ford, Massachusetts, where we were working in an orphanage, teaching social workers and nuns to set up groups in which older kids would help younger kids, and in which children at every age level were encouraged to take more responsibility for running the school and planning their lives. We set up another project in a slum housing district in a Boston suburb. Here were hundreds of people who were bogged down socially and psycho- logically. They could not afford psychiatric help and there was none available for them. With an- other group of graduate students, I used to go down there one night a week with tape recorders and blackboards. We set up headquarters in one of the slum apartments and started teaching groups of the neighbors how they could help each other and SPIRITUAL INSIGHT: The transcendental experi- ence provided by the drugs propels the subject beyond space, time, ego, culture, etc. The implications of this visionary experience were utilized in the program. INTERPERSONAL TRUST AND CLOSENESS: Evidence shows that when subjects share an ego-shat- tering experience together they develop strong positive emotional bonds."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"176 00 Liberate the Imprisoned SELF-HELP AND MUTUAL HELP: The most successful re- habilitation methods (A.A., Synanon group dynamic T groups, etc.) seem to be those which turn over re- sponsibility to the subjects themselves and which stim- ulate them to help each other. The drug experience facilitates this tendency. EMOTIONAL AND PRACTICAL SUPPORT: The model used was not doctor-patient or expert- client but that of human be- ings who believe in each other and want to help each other. The project developed the model of friends who are available to help group members stay out of trouble and maintain a responsible role in society. In our research we helped inmates get jobs, purchase union cards, made small loans and spent hours in friendly advising interaction.

Universities are supposed to be research institutes, and if you get too involved in service functions or helping people, you're considered a bleeding heart. I was able to justify the work in the orphanage, the work with alcoholics, the work in the slum projects, by using the word methodology. We weren't really trying to help these people. No sir, not us. We were trying to develop new techniques and scientific methods for changing psychotherapeutic theory. Of course, if people enjoyed it and got help, that was an interesting by-product which supported the method and the theory. It was all experimental, you see. It became a tradition in the center where I worked that any time they got a call from a do- good social service agency requesting Harvard's help in curing any sort of social disease, the request was likely to get bucked to me because they knew that this was my vice and my eccentricity. One day I got a note in my box saying that two men from the Department of Legal Medicine were interested in enlisting Harvard's help in the psycho- logical rehabilitation of prisoners. Now prison work is considered to be the least interesting, lowest status work you can do in the field of psychology, psychiatry, and sociology. The problems are hope- less. Criminals never change. The atmosphere is dreary and the academic rewards are slim. But when I found this little piece of paper in my box requesting an appointment from two officials from the Department of Legal Medicine, I chuckled all the way to my office because this was just the chance I was looking for. By this time, we had given the psychedelic mush- rooms to about a hundred people in a wide variety of circumstances, and we had learned a lot about the process. In spite of the bungling and the confu- sion and our ignorance, we still hadn't caused any damage to anyone and there were a lot of mistakes that we'd never make again. By this time we had learned a few things about how to run the sessions. About 90 percent of the people who were taking the magic mushrooms were reporting the most ecstatic"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"March 1961 00 177 and educational experience of their lrtfes. The prob- lem was, there was no way to get any measurement as to how much good we were doing. There was no way to keep score. This of course is the main problem in the field of psychotherapy. You can develop a completely effec- tive method of treating people's psychological prob- lems, but there is no way you can prove it. You can work with one thousand people and help every one of them change his way of thinking and his way of acting, but there are no statistics (like hits, runs, and errors) with which to tabulate your score. The problem is that half the people you help are going to get better jobs, and half of them are going to quit the jobs they have. Half of them may increase the intimacy and closeness and meaning in their marriages, but the other half may leave their wives. Changing a person's psyche is one thing, but measuring results in an observable way is another thing. Because who's to say which behavior reflects growth and change. Here's where the prison came in. The prison is the ideal place to do a study in psychotherapy behavior change, because when you try to rehabili- tate prisoners, you've got an ironclad statistic you can work against. It's called the recidivism rate. When you are working with people outside, they may quit their job and join the Peace Corps, or they may quit their job and join the ministry, or they may quit the ministry and take up guitar, and you know about the growth of this person, but who else will believe it? But when you work with prisoners and you think you've helped them change, grow, and become more effective people, there's an easy way to tell. Where are they a year after you've finished with them? Are they back in jail, or are they making it on the outside? Prisoner rehabilita- tion offers the most objective check for someone who claims he can bring about change in behavior. In the prisons of Massachusetts the recidivism rate is about 70 percent. Seven out of every ten men who leave prison, return. If you develop a new and surefire way of changing man's mind, the prison presents the toughest and cleanest test of your effectiveness. Can you keep him out of jail? That's Inmates received on the average four doses of psilo- cybin. Dosage ran from 20 mg. in early sessions to 70 mg. Now we employ 30 mg. as a standard, moderate dose. Inmates were given person- ality tests before, and six months after, the program began. Significant de- creases in hostility, cyni- cism, social delinquency and irresponsibility were registered. There seems to be general agreement that the effects of the program in-the-insti- tution were quite dramatic. The behavior and attitude of the project members be- came more mature and so- cial. The post-release events, however, involved a differ- ent set of factors and re- quired several revisions in the program. POST-RELEASE PROGRAM: The main conclusion of our two-year pilot study is that institutional programs, how- ever effective, count for little after the ex-convict reaches the street. The so- cial pressures faced are so overwhelming as to make change very difficult. We recognized very early in our work the advantages of a post-release program."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"178 00 Liberate the Imprisoned Our philosophic and theo- retical orientation led us to encourage inmates to plan and execute their own pro- gram. We fondly hoped for a half- way house run by ex-in- mates along the lines of the successful Synanon pro- gram. In June, 1961, a non-profit organization, Freedom Cen- ter, was set up to admin- ister the post- re I ease pro- gram. Our hopes for a con- vict-run halfway house did not materialize. We had too few men in the Boston area and they were too caught up in the des- perate struggle to survive, to spare time, to help others. In 1961, as a beginning step toward a halfway house, we began Project Contact. The purpose of this project was to keep in regular contact with all group members. By these means we were able to reach ninety-one percent of ex-inmates living in Massachusetts. A newsletter and personal letters also kept up con- tact and seemed to be ef- fective in helping the re- habilitation spirit stay alive. why I wanted to get into the prison. Now, the reason the prison psychologists wanted to get into Harvard is that everyone in any aca- demic or professional activity in the Boston area has one way of measuring his success. Can he get on the Harvard payroll? The word Harvard in the Boston area is a powerful status symbol that oper- ates at every level of society. There are several thousand janitors around the Boston area, but if you are a janitor at Harvard, you're a prince among custodians. The same with a cook, the same with a gardener, the same with a psychologist. A week later, I found myself sitting at a corner table in the Harvard Faculty Club with two officials from the Massachusetts prison system. What they wanted was simple. They wanted to have Harvard graduate students assigned to the prisons as psy- chology interns with a possible long-range hope of getting themselves clinical professorships at Har- vard. And what I wanted was to get Harvard graduate students into the prisons because that's where I felt that all embryonic psychologists should be out in the field, dealing with real people and real problems. But there was something else I wanted and that was the chance to show that we could rehabilitate criminals by using the sacred mushrooms. And so the deal was made. I agreed to get Harvard approval to send graduate students to internships in the prison, and they agreed that if I could get the approval of the warden and the prison psychiatrists, I could give psychedelic mush- rooms to prisoners. About a week later I drove out to the prison. I wore my Harvard tweed suit and my button-down shirt. The warden was impressed and pleased. It wasn't often that Harvard professors came out to the prison to do research. But the whole thing hinged on the approval of the psychiatrists, because the sacred mushrooms were drugs and to work with drugs you had to have the medical okay. So, we walked down the hallway to the metal cage that let us into the prison. We opened up the first steel door and we stood in the anteroom. Then we rang a bell, a slot opened, and a guard looked at us and opened up the second metal door. We walked into the"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"March 1961 00 179 middle of the guardroom, across the prison yard to the hospital where we rang the bell and got peered at through the slot, heard the metal hinges creak, and walked into the prison hospital. We walked down the corridor to the psychiatrist's office and knocked on the door. After a minute, out walked one of the most entertaining and interesting men in American psychiatry. The first thing that struck me about the prison psychiatrist was that he was the best-dressed man I had ever seen. He was short, graceful, like a ballet dancer. The first Negro psy- chiatrist I had ever met. I spent an hour talking with Dr. Madison Presnell. He was no intellectual; he mispronounced some of the polysyllabic words, but he had a twinkle in his eye and a wise, cool way of looking at you that told you he was a man who had seen a lot and suffered a lot, and was still looking for the funniest and wisest part of everyone he came in contact with. In sizing up Dr. Presnell, I could say to myself a word I had heard used quite often in recent months. He was hip. It was obvious, too, that he had had some experience with psychedelic drugs. Which ones, he didn't make clear. He could have had LSD in medical school, or mescaline in psy- chiatric research, or maybe pot in the Village, but he knew what I was talking about. A few days later Dr. Presnell came over to Har- vard to meet some of my bosses, and the following Sunday he brought his beautiful and intelligent wife over to my house for cocktails. He sat down on a chair in my study, thought for a minute and said, \"Your plan to give psychedelic drugs to prisoners is the best idea I've heard for dealing with an impos- sible problem. If you're smart enough and dedi- cated enough to know how to do it, you could make it work. There's one chance in a hundred you can pull it off, but if you do, you will have accom- plished more for American society and for prisoner rehabilitation than has been done in the last four thousand years since the code of Hammurabi. But it's risky business. You're bound to run into trouble. As a matter of fact, the more successful you are, the more trouble you're going to stir up. Because one thing I've learned as a prison psychiatrist is that But increased contact only strengthened our convic- tions that an A.A.-type or- ganization of ex-convicts is necessary. The initial step of finding the small nucleus of men who are ready to make the dedication needed has not yet been taken. As a possible solution we hope to be able to send two ex-inmates to spend a month living at Synanon House, Santa Monica. The Director of Synanon, Mr. Chuck Dederich, has ex- pressed interest in this project. The next step of selecting two ex-inmates to make the trip is waiting to be taken. Upon their return, Freedom Center is prepared to offer its resources to support a local self-help residence program.

A few days later I was in my office when a knock came on the door, and I was visited by a graduate student named Ralph Metzner. Metzner had a rep- utation for being one of the smartest students in the department. He was a graduate of Oxford, an experimentalist, a precise, objective, and apparently very academic young man. He said he had heard about the prison project and he wanted to work with me on it. My first reaction was that Metzner was too academic, too dainty-British, too bookish, too ivory tower, to walk into a prison and roll up his sleeves and take drugs that would put him out of his mind, with rough and tumble prisoners. Metzner said he wanted to learn how. Then I said, Before you can give drugs and take drugs with anyone else, you have to have some experiences yourself. Are you ready to take mushrooms? He was ready. As a matter of fact, that's exactly what he wanted to do, to have a session. And so it happened that on March 12, 1961, at my home in Newton, Massachusetts, I ran a session for Dr. Presnell and his beautiful wife, for Ralph Metzner and his girl friend and another graduate student, Gunther Weil and his wife, Karen. This was the fifty-second time I had taken psilocybin with other people. The notes on the session say, This training session was designed to introduce several new subjects to the sacred mushroom expe- rience under supportive circumstances. The session took place in my study. Since this was an exploratory training session, I told the par- ticipants that they should relax, have a good time, be entertained, and learn what they could. Dr. Presnell was the dominating factor in this session. His joking and warm attitude created a benign atmosphere. Each new subject had his spouse or a trusted friend present. After a long period of happy, relaxed giggling, the joking became more and more philosophic. Members of the group would leave the room periodically to be by them- The life-changing therapeu- tic effects of the psilocybin experience do not last for more than seventy-two hours unless the subject is in a situation which en- courages him to maintain his emotional and spiritual insights. Therefore, psilocybin must be used in on-going pro- grams of therapy or self- help. When employed in such programs, psilocybin is a dramatically useful, educational, and rehabilita- tive instrument. If the subject shares time and space subsequently with those who have had the experience, his chances of maintaining the insights are increased. The actual scoreboard is difficult to interpret. The aims of this project were: 1) to help keep men on the street and 2) to help them in constructive contact with each other.

There were no discordant notes, no anxiety, depression, or friction. We were finally getting to the point where we knew how to set up a pleasant session. Each member of this six- person group reported a deep, ecstatic, educational experience. A few days after this session, Ralph Metzner, Gunther Weil, and I drove out to the concrete prison and met with the six volunteers who had been selected by Dr. Presnell. We sat around a table, in a dreary hospital room with gray walls, black asphalt floor, bars in the windows, telling six skeptical and suspicious men about an experience which could change their lives. The first psychedelic session in the prison was well planned. The first thing we did was to tell the prisoners as much as we could about the psyche- delic experience. We brought in books for them to read, reports by other subjects, articles which de- scribed the terrors as well as the ecstasies of the experience. We spent most of the time describing our own experiences and answering groping ques- tions. We made it very clear to the prisoners that this was nothing we were doing to them. There was no doctor-patient game going here. We would take the drugs along with them. We were doing nothing to them that we wouldn't willingly, happily have done to ourselves. We also made a research con- tract with the prisoners. We said something like this, We want to find out how and how much you change during this experience. For this reason, we want you to take a battery of psychological tests before you eat the mushrooms. Then, after three or four sessions with the sacred mushrooms, well give you the tests again. The aim here is to find out how you change, like you weigh yourself on a scale before and after you go on a diet. After you've taken the tests, we'll give you the results. We'll go over the tests with you and explain how you were before and how you changed. Nothing in this pro- ject is going to be a secret. We've told you every- thing we know about the drugs before you take them and we'll tell you everything we know about you after you finish your sessions."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"March 1961 00 183 That sounded like a good deal to them, and the following week each prisoner was administered a long and complicated battery of psychological tests. And it happened that on March 27, 1961, in the large ward room in the prison infirmary in Con- cord, Massachusetts, five prisoners and three Har- vard psychologists met for a trip. In the morning I was to turn-on with three convicts, and the two other prisoners and the two graduate students would act as observers. Then in the afternoon Gunther Weil and Ralph Metzner and the two observing prisoners were to take the drug, and the rest of us were to act as guides. We brought a record player, tape recorder, and some books of classical art with us. Otherwise the room was bleak in decor, with four beds, a large table, and a few chairs. At 9:35 in the morning the bowl of pills was placed in the center of the table. I was the first one to turn-on in the prison project. I reached over, took fourteen milligrams of psilocybin. Then I handed the bowl to the prisoner next to me, and he took twenty milligrams and passed it on to the guy next to him who took twenty, and the next man. Then we pushed the bowl to the middle of the table and sat back to see what would happen. I'll never forget that morning. After about half an hour, I could feel the effect coming up, the loosen- ing of symbolic reality, the feeling of humming pressure and space voyage inside my head, the sharp, brilliant, brutal intensification of all the sen- ses. Every cell and every sense organ was humming with charged electricity. I felt terrible. What a place to be on a gray morning! In a dingy room in a grim penitentiary, out of my mind. I looked over at the man next to me, a Polish embezzler from Worces- ter, Massachusetts. I could see him so clearly. I could see every pore in his face, every blemish, the hairs in his nose, the incredible green-yellow enamel of the decay in his teeth, the wet glistening of his frightened eyes. I could see every hair in his head, as though each was as big as an oak tree. What a confrontation! What am I doing here, out of my mind, with this strange mosaic-celled animal, prisoner, criminal? I said to him with a weak grin, How are you doing, John? He said, I feel fine.

All participated in the drug ingestion. for a minute and asked, How are you doing, Doc? I was about to say in a reassuring psychological tone that I felt fine, but I couldn't, so I said, I feel lousy. John drew back his purple-pink lips, showed his green-yellow teeth in a sickly grin, and said, What's the matter, Doc? Why you feel lousy? I looked with my two microscopic retina lenses into his eyes. I could see every line, yellow spider webs, red network of veins gleaming out at me. I said, John, I'm afraid of you. His eyes got bigger, then he began to laugh. I could look inside his mouth, swollen red tissues, gums, tongue, throat. I was prepared to be swallowed. Then I heard him say, Well that's funny, Doc, 'cause I'm afraid of you. We were both smiling at this point, leaning for- ward. Doc, he said, why are you afraid of me? I said, I'm afraid of you, John, because you're a criminal. He nodded. I said, John, why are you afraid of me? He said, I'm afraid of you, Doc, because you're a mad scientist. Then our retinas locked and I slid down into the tunnel of his eyes, and I could feel him walking around in my skull and we both began to laugh. And there it was, that dark moment of fear and distrust, which could have changed in a second to become hatred and terror. But we made the love connection. The flicker in the dark. Suddenly, the sun came out in the room and I felt great and I knew he did too. Fire below and the lake above combat and des- troy each other. So too in the course of the year a combat takes place between the forces of light and the forces of darkness, eventuating in the revolution of the seasons. Man masters these changes in nature by noting their regularity and marking off the passage of time accordingly. In this way order and clarity appear in the apparently chaotic changes of the seasons, and man is able to adjust himself in advance to the demands of the different times.

There were the four of us, turned-on, every sense vibrating, pulsating with messages, two billion years of cellular wisdom, but what could we do trapped within the four walls of a gray hospital room, barred inside a maximum security prison? Then, one of the great lessons in my psychedelic training took place. One of the turned-on prisoners was a Negro from Texas, jazz saxophone player, heroin addict. He looked around with two huge balls of ocular white, shook his head, staggered over to the record player, put on a record. It was a Sonny Rollins record which he'd especially asked us to bring. Then he lay down on the cot and closed his eyes. The rest of us sat by the table while metal air from the yellow saxophone spinning across copper electric wires bounced off the walls of the room. There was a long silence. Then we heard Willy moaning softly and moving restlessly on the couch. I turned and looked at him and said, Willy, are you all right? There was apprehension in my voice. Everyone in the room swung his head anx- iously to look and listen for the answer. Willy lifted his head, gave a big grin, and said, Man, am I all right? I'm in heaven and I can't believe it! Here I am in heaven man, and I'm stoned out of my mind, and I'm swinging like I've never been before and it's all happening in prison, and you ask me man, am I all right. What a laugh! And then he laughed and we all laughed and suddenly we were all high and happy and chuckling at what we had done, bringing music, and love, and beauty, and serenity, and fun, and the seed of life into that grim and dreary prison. Well, the session went on and on. There were high points and low points, ecstasies and terrors. My friend John, the Polish man, got sick and vomited. We all got pretty thoughtful. Why are there prisons? Why do some men put the warm cellular envelopes of their fellowmen in metal cages? What were we doing here? Then after a few hours, Ralph and Gunther and the two remaining convicts turned-on.

Dr. Presnell would check in every now and then, walk around the room like a dainty, graceful cat, not saying much, but taking it all in. And the guards came in bringing metal trays of food which we all looked at with disbelief, the way you'd look at a plate of worms or a pot of sawdust served up to you on a plate, and someone said, Man, do they call that food? Since we Harvard people weren't allowed to eat prison food at the expense of the state, Dr. Presnell went out and got milkshakes and sandwiches which we all shared, and we had never tasted food so good. Then at five o'clock, there was a bang on the door, and we opened it and the guards came in and said, Time is up, men. Back to the prison ward. Ralph, Gunther, and I went with the five prisoners back to the lockup part of the hospital and sat there on beds, and smoked, and laughed, and compared notes on what we'd seen, and where we'd been. Then it was time for us to go. We shook hands, said we'd be back tomorrow, and Ralph and Gunther and I walked out of the prison, across the dark yard, rang the bell, and waited until the iron doors opened into the guardroom, and then across the guardroom, through the two metal doors, and down the metal stairs, past the clanking, steaming, old-fashioned radiators, and then we were outside. Ralph and Gunther got into their car and drove back to Cambridge, and I got in my car and drove to Newton. As I rode along the highway, the tension and the drama of the day suddenly snapped off and I could look back and see what we had done. Nothing, you see, is secret in a prison, and the eight of us who had assembled to take drugs together in a prison were under the microscopic gaze of every convict in the prison and every guard, and within hours the word would have fanned through the invisible net- work to every other prison in the state.

To begin with I was completely unprepared for what was to happen, what changes were to take place in my beliefs, re-evaluating myself to the point of nothingness. My whole way of life was so transparent while under psilocybin, that coming out from under the mushroom, I was in a deep state of shock. I use deep shock figuratively. This thirst for knowledge I had ... is . . . was ... it seems so meaningless now. More so because I was applying it to some abstract idea, some complicated intrigue of my own. As to my first awareness of my real self, it was when my conversing partner, Smithy, was searching for a complicated word in re- gards to something that needed a very simple word. It was then this idea flashed thru my mind, could it pos- sibly be that what I was looking for is so very simple also. And then to my utter amazement, I realized I wasn't fighting the world, I was fighting myself. The first psychedelic session at the prison set up powerful repercussions. First there was the effect on the little group of voyagers. Strong bonds had developed. We had been through the ordeal together. We had gone beyond the games of Harvard psychologist and convict. We had stripped off social facade and faced fear together and we had trusted and laughed. I felt at home in the prison. It always works this way after a good trip. You die and then you are reborn. The place of your rebirth is home. This is not metaphorical it is a neurological reality. During the psychedelic session the nervous sys- tem returns to that state of flux and unity-chaos of infancy and spins beyond familiar time-space where there is no home because all is a two-billion- year process of homing. As the session ends, one is reborn ( smoothly or with a jolt ) . This is the period of reentry the return from space to the planet. That place to which you return becomes neurologi- cally engraved in your subsequent consciousness. It is a new \"home' a new neurological center. In scientific papers we described this as the process of re-imprinting. A rewiring of the nervous system. There is a strong biochemical attachment to the people, the objects, the scents and sights, of the place to which you return. This accounts for the LSD cult phenomenon. In our case the hospital room of the prison had become a center. A home. It was wired into my head. The morning after the session, driving back to the prison was like going back to some sacred place in my skull. Meeting the prisoners was like a family reunion. Our status in the prison was changed.

Guards and parole officers stopped us to ask questions or to request that a favorite prisoner be admitted to the psychedelic group. We spent the next two weeks discussing the reports that the prisoners wrote and comparing notes on the trip. Then we ran a second session. This time the prisoners were more sophisticated. There was no sitting around on chairs in nervous anticipation. As soon as the energy began to radiate through their bodies they headed for the cot, fell- out, and closed their eyes. For the next two or three hours they lay engulfed in the visions, occasionally sitting up to smile or make some Zen comment. The Harvard guides changed the records and sat quietly, watching the cellular clocks in the room whirring, occasionally approaching the voyagers, a hand on the shoulder, a smile, the cosmic nod of affirmation. And the looks of wonder and sharing. Oh Doc! Amazing. This stuff is amazing. It's all always amazing, Tony. Do you want any- thing? Yeah, Doc. I'm thirsty. I brought the glass of water. In sitting up, Tony spilled a few drops. His eyes riveted on the little wet puddle on the gray blanket. Water, he said wondering. Life and water. Where does the water come from, Doc? We are water creatures, aren't we? Yeah, my body is the sea. Sometimes the microscopes of inner vision focused on their lives. Jerry huddled under his blanket sobbing, his head shaking back and forth. Oh Doc, what a selfish fool I've been! My family. Wasted years. Wasted years. Will I get another chance, Doc? Can I go back and try it again? Nine in the fourth place means: He climbs up on his wall; HE CANNOT ATTACK. Good fortune. ( I Ching XIII ) It keeps going, Jerry. Every moment it starts all over again. Should I retain this ethical position, or disregard it for the present, to let him un- derstand and see how much more there is to life, than living behind these walls in a state of mental and physi- cal stagnation. And finally he came to the decision, to show me how much I was missing with just the be feeling, and not being there feeling, let me expound on this for a mo- ment. Smithy asked me if I missed these different things out- side of prison, that he and everyone else was enjoy- ing, and my answer was something to the effect, oh! But I have these same things you have, by just substituting the being there feeling with the be feeling, then he asked me to teach him this feeling, because with this feeling, Smithy be- lieved he would be able to solve the many problems of mankind. The possibility of saving so much money, pain, mis- takes, etc., seemed to him to be so important, and to me so ridiculous, that I explained to him that he was not ready yet, and to this answer he became so sad and unhappy, that I ex- plained to him there wasn't to my knowledge anything to take the place of the be- ing there feeling."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"194 00 The Prisoners Will Become Priests From there we concen- trated on communication with the lower levels of in- telligence. Smithy's idea was to find a way to plug into their minds for this knowledge we need to at- tain this high pinnacle of knowledge, and Smithy, be- lieving if we were the su- perior minds, wasn't it up to us to find a way of com- municating with them, and not they with us. But I disagreed, I believed we should first reach this high level of knowledge, and then if we have any desire to learn what they have, fine, if not it wouldn't make any difference any- way. But as usual Smithy's clear and logical mind took over, he showed me how much fuel could be used from each man's mind along the way. And I agreed to this idea. So in summation, we found that knowledge alone was meaningless, knowledge must have fuel from these other channels. These everyday pleasures, the loves, the sadness, the small problems. These to- gether with knowledge would balance out, to give man the proper guide in life, without them, man would become hopelessly lost. We arranged the room in sacred design. Incense. Candles. The convicts would lie watching the flick- ering flame. Outside the barred windows they could see the prison wall and the guard tower. Candlelight and the flash of sunlight on the guard- ing rifles. Why are there prisons, Doc? What are we doing here? Wanted men. It's insane, Doc. We're all in- sane. Us cons and the cops and the guards. How did we get into this? Each session was a cosmic drama. Confusion. Humor, lots of laughter. Olympian multi-level god laughter. Loneliness. Tears. Terrors. Suspicion. Trust. After the third session the convicts repeated the personality tests to measure changes. We brought the test folders into the hospital room and handed them to the inmates. No secrets. We explained what the tests measured and what the results meant. They had changed. Showed less depression, hos- tility, antisocial tendencies, more energy, responsi- bility, cooperation. The objective indices so dear to the heart of the psychologist had swung dramatic- ally and significantly in the direction of increased mental health. By explaining their test results to them and letting them handle their own test scores, we were training them the same way we trained Harvard graduate students in psychodiagnostics. To learn what the test meant. How they were changing. The prisoners were becoming psychologists. They loved it. Fierce debates about personality characteristics. The psychiatric diagnostic game be- ing played by the cons. After a few weeks of discussion we planned with the inmates the continuation of research. The con- victs were to select the new recruits for the group. They would learn how to administer the psycholog- ical tests. They would give the orientation lectures. They would run the project. Here the reconciliation that follows quarrel moves nearer. It is true that there are still dividing walls on which we stand confronting one another. But the difficulties are too great. We get into straits, and"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Spring 1961 00 195 this brings us to our senses. We cannot fight, and therein lies our good fortune. ( I Ching XIII ) At this point we ran into prison politics. The social structure of a prison is like any village. There is a very explicit hierarchy. The inmates themselves run the prison. All the guards and administrators do is keep the peace, but the gut, muscle, moment- to-moment space-time issues are determined by prisoners. The inmates belong to invisible social clans and the clan leader decides what happens. If the warden and guards violate the dignity and prerogatives of the convict leaders there is trouble. And all admin- istrators want to avoid trouble. One day when we walked into the hospital there were two new inmate medical attendants. They were men in their forties. Tough, proud, hard cus- tomers. They walked up to me. Doctor Leary, I'm Jim Berrigan. This is Don Sainten. We'd like to talk to you. Fine, but I'm late for the project meeting. Maybe later. No. The meeting can wait. Let's talk now. I looked at them closely. They were men of confi- dence and dignity, power-holders, leaders. Dress them differently and they could be sea captains or chief surgeons or Broadway promoters. I nodded and they motioned me down the hall. We walked into the hospital kitchen. I'd never been there before. Don walked to the stove and turned on the burner under a coffee pot. Bacon and eggs, Doc? No thanks. Coffee will do. Jim and Don sat on the high serving counter and grinned. We've been watching this mushroom busi- ness, Doc, and it looks pretty good to us and we've decided to join your project. We'll be a lot of help to you. We've arranged transfers to the hospital so we can be right on call. The words were cool and cocky and seemed to leave no room for question. I explained that the decisions about who joined the project were made by the convicts in the group. I couldn't interfere but I'd pass their names on to the inmate planning group. The most sobering effect the mushroom had on me, was midway in our conver- sation. I asked Smithy if he realized that we had not mentioned God once Smithy's answer verbatim, (Have we done anything else). One could not realize the meaning of this an- swer and what effect it had to my reasoning unless one understood that up un- til Monday I believed I was much more than I turned out to be, not a pretty pic- ture for one to witness un- prepared. In conclusion I must state briefly, that I enjoyed the mushroom on one hand, but on the other hand, it frightened me, I say fright- ened, because I saw my- self for what I really was, but even tho this picture was seen for what it really was, I look to the future with enthusiasm, and to pursue psilocybin to its end. What is it like to be under psilocybin, being able to see colors in all its bril- liance and absolute splen- dor, it is by all means an atmosphere I would want to be in all the time able to understand myself, mu- sic, and what it means, the feeling one gets from listen- ing to such superb music as classics. Actions and thinking that I have done before are being changed to a more mag- nificent and truer way; thoughts have come to me under psilocybin such as past manners in treating people with a much better attitude and respect."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"196 00 The Prisoners Will Become Priests This has taken me years to do and so after all these years I have found a way, thru the help of psilocybin. It has helped me in spelling and reading. I remember when I couldn't hold ten words in my head, but now I have words like antidises- tablishmentarianism long yes, but a word with any accomplishment, and there are others I am seeking to accomplish in accordance to psilocybin. A great deal of the pictures I seen were transparent, clear enough to see and un- derstand and to speak about after my session. It was nice to experience. There was nothing vicious about my two experiences, nor was it extravagent, but it was extraordinary and therefore I must praise and glorify this experience and all its wonder. It explored my mind and opened up a gate that has been closed for a long time, and with this acknowledgment I can keep it open and let this memory mellifluous itself through me because there is no need to be menda- cious, dishonest. It is time to mend that which is broken. Psilocybin has showed me how wrong I have been in my disinclination, I now care to emulate, strive for the better things in life. Jim and Don grinned. I don't think that those guys will give us any static, Doc, we usually get what we want around here. Don't we, Don? Don nodded. There was muscle and hard prick behind the words. I liked them and had to respect them. And it was more politics. Dealing with the powers that be. I grinned and said, I'm pleased that you're inter- ested. It's a new and good thing we're doing and it works. It's also fun. I hope you'll join us. When I mentioned to our planning group that Jim and Don had volunteered there was an uneasy ripple, and murmurs about who exactly is in charge, and I thought the project was going to be democratic. By democratic we mean that we should run it, right? We had already run into some problems of power and authority in turning our decisions over to the convicts. The intoxicating taste of command. Two of the inmates had thrown themselves into the doctor-psychologist role with great energy and had developed pompous professional facades in dealing with their \"clients.\" They tended to be fussy and schoolmasterly punitive. The other cons didn't like it. And everyone was uneasy about Jim and Don coming into the project. They were big men in the prison. They were boss cons. They'll take over. Hey, wait a minute. If they come into the project they'll have to take the mushrooms. There was a thoughtful silence and then every- one began to laugh. And if they take the drug they'll flip out of their minds and beyond the game of being boss convicts. Right? And they'll be stripped naked like everyone else. And they'll come back changed like the rest of us. If the mushrooms really work, if they produce insight and love, then they'll work for Jim and Don. Yeah, and for the guards too. Let's invite the screws to turn-on. So it was agreed that Don and Jim could join the group. They were tested and listened to the orien- tation talks and held out their tough-guy hands one sunny morning to receive the sacrament."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"198 00 The Prisoners Will Become Priests I don't know of any other way for a person to ease tension, but maybe some could try a hobby or listen to music, maybe classical or spiritual. I am sure that somewhere along these lines you will find peace of mind. On my second session, while ! was under psilocy- bin and laying in bed with the covers over my head, a picture came into view as clear as I have ever seen before, and this was of Christ in the manger with these people standing and kneeling by his side. This picture stayed with me for a few moments, and then thousands of Christmas lights came into view dif- ferent shapes and forms and designs of colors that was of tremendous bril- liance and elegance. I was wondering at one point if I was living, or was this heaven that I had heard so much about. Be- ing able to experience these things have made me do a great deal of think- ing in rechanneling my life. One must come a long way before he can find him- self and I really hope I have. I also have now a great conception of classic music whereas one time I would never think of listening to such music. This trip was being guided by Gunther Weil and two inmates from the original group. After an hour Jimmy Berrigan started to show signs of distress. Jimmy was one of the hardest men in Massachusetts. He belonged to a famous Boston waterfront gang a rugged, violent tribe. Jimmy was a professional outlaw. Proud. Touchy. Cocky. A man whose culture and whose long life was totally dedicated to strength, bicep control. And now, as it comes to all men, the ultimate humiliation was coming to tough Jimmy in a sunlit room in the hospital ward in Concord prison. Jimmy suddenly discovered he had fallen into a trap. He had bulled his way into the project to enhance his power in the prison. The mushrooms were good, and anything good in the prison be- longed, by tribal custom, to Berrigan. And now he lay on a cot, rendered weak, his mind spinning away, his control slipping, overwhelmed by a thou- sand shadowy cellular faces mocking his illusions of strength. This wasn't what he expected. This was a differ- ent high from booze and bennies and happy pills. He had fallen into a diabolic con game perpetrated by Harvard psychologists. After forty-five years of defiance and arrogance Jimmy was fallen. He raged in despair. He should have known better than to trust his natural enemies, these smooth-faced, glib middle-class professionals. What a sucker he was to fall for their line, to forget that power was every- thing. To let them slip him these immobilizing pills. Well, he'd go down fighting. He tried to sit up, but his body was a tangle of pulsating wires and warm liquids. It was a nice feeling but he felt strange and weak. He looked around the room which was alive with belted radiance. Where were his tormentors? Ah, there was Gunther, young pip- squeak kid who couldn't hold his own for five seconds in a barroom brawl now smiling at him in malevolent triumph. He motioned for Gunther to come over and then fell back on the pillow. How are you Jimmy? I'm terrible, I'm dying. Well you got me, you clever bastard, but I'm not finished.

Gunther's face looked blank. Get me for what? For trapping me this way, you smug Harvard fink. Gunther felt a flicker of fear. He was turned-on too. Visions of gangland slayings. Cruel, implacable hoodlum revenge. How did he, a well-brought-up middle-class Jewish boy with good school grades get himself involved in this scene of wickedness and violence. Because of the mushrooms. The ec- stasy had led him on. He had been warned of this. The grim Judeo-Christian retribution. You pay for your bliss. Now he was paying for his mushroom kicks. He looked down at the face of his murderer, the rugged, waterfront grimacing features of this hood, this devil Berrigan whose dread retribution was to fall on him. Thoughts of escape flashed through his mind. He glanced at the barred win- dows. He was trapped in the prison, surrounded by thugs who would spring to the command of the master criminal. Tears came to his eyes. What a tragedy, to be cut down in his promising youth. He cursed the day he had even listened to the mushroom song and all the glib psychedelic teachings which sounded so good but which just lured you into the void of hell. The two men stood transfixed in horror and hate. Slim Harvard and grizzled outlaw. Caught together in some cold hopeless whirlpool of cosmic energy. Frightened and frightening each other. Blaming each other. Man hopelessly isolated from man. The other men in the room watched silently. Jimmy snarled again. My brother will kill you for this. How can they kill me, Jimmy, I'm dying right now. Dying. Death. Rebirth. Some long-forgotten wire of memory flickered. Death-rebirth. Trust the pro- cess. Gunther closed his eyes and the words came to him. The prayer. He struggled to move his throat and tongue, and then the words came out quaver- ing, shaky, a strange little voice, but the message was there. Jimmy Berrigan looked up in disbelief. His eyes widened. Then he understood. From Psilocybin has a way of opening up the mind and letting you see different pictures and gradually you will grasp these significants, and use them as they should be used. 00 Prisoner Trip Report #2: I feel as an antiquarian does while searching for ancient relics anticipation before the discovery once discovered the journey to make known what is un- known.

Unbelievable. God did exist. The old teachings were true. Not in the stilted, phony effeminate accents of the Boston priesthood whose piety he despised, but in the voice which sighed and breathed in his cells. He reached up and grabbed Gunther's hand, and their eyes met in a smile. And the session reel spun on. The initiation of Jimmy and Don increased the feeling of centeredness at the prison. Coming to Concord was like returning on pilgrimage to a holy place. A conspiracy was emerging. We started plotting a mass prison break. It is the nature of fire to flame up to heaven. This gives the idea of fellowship. Here, clarity is within and strength without the character of a peaceful union of men, which, in order to hold together, needs one yielding nature among many firm persons. ( I Ching XIII ) The name of the game was keep-out. We agreed that cops-and-robbers was ridiculous; the prisoner- guard game absurd. The perpetuation of these social dances depended on someone willing to play the part of the criminal. The entire top-heavy ad- ministrative structure, policemen, detectives, in- formers, lawyers, district attorneys, judges, pro- bation and parole officers, guards, wardens, prison psychiatrists all were dependent on the hero-star- bad-guy to make their good-guy parts have mean- ing. The criminals were the fall guys, the victims who kept the whole game going. The solution was obvious. The prisoners had to turn-on, see the game the way it was, and then drop-out. Just stop playing the bad-boy game. See it, laugh at it, and drop-out. So we made a contract. . . . Everyone in the group would do everything he could to help every member get out and stay out of prison. Not just sessions and discussions in the prison, but practical help in getting out, in finding a job, and dealing with life on the outside."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Spring 1961 00 201 We were proposing a family, clan- type group. This was very different from professional bureau- cratic rehabilitation. The motto of the rehabilitation worker is detachment. Don't get emotionally in- volved with the client. You will be seduced or conned. A mass-assembly-line rehabilitation se- quence, in which the psychologist performs his tests and turns the patient over to the psychiatrist, who treats the patient and sends him cured to the parole board, which decides on the basis of its own criteria whether to allow parole. The parolee is then inves- tigated and supervised by parole officers. Complete depersonalization all the way down the line. The prisoner is treated this way because he comes from a family which either won't or can't help him. His clan has been fragmented. He is an isolated loner, an anonymous cog in the social machine. Our strategy was exactly opposite to the de- tached professional approach. The aim was to build a network of friends who would help each other. To construct a group that could perform some of the functions of the tribe. If a middle-class person gets in trouble he is typically rescued by middle-class know-how which bails him out, gets him a lawyer, talks middle-class jargon to the officials, gets him a job, provides him with a middle-class home to return to. Our plan was to use the resources of our group ( including middle-class know-how ) to weave a web of protection for the convicts. I've been thru a complete change of life, an experi- ence that the average 20- year-old does not go thru but when they do go thru this change, the better things are ahead. I know myself in such a way that I can account for my thoughts and what they mean and what use they will be put to. Prison can lead a man down to nothing in a very short time. There were times when I felt myself slipping and filling my mind full of ideas that were no good. The ideas are still there but only as a guide to show me that I cannot af- ford to make a life of crimi- nal doings. . . . Said Gandalf . . .

One of our members was coming up for a parole hearing. Johnny O'Connell, a genial Irishman. Johnny was caught by the standard dilemma of the lower-class convict. In order to be paroled he needed a job and home. His family was disintegrated, helpless, un- caring and could offer no home. And how could he get a job when he was uneducated, untrained, socially tarnished and, being in prison, unable to canvas prospective employers? Unless something was done he would meet the parole board and be turned back for another year of incarceration for the crime of not having a family, a tribal group to support him. So we went to work. First, to get him a job. Johnny's occupations in the past had been itinerant and casual. Dish washer. Handy man. Laborer. We phoned around Boston to find an employer who wanted to guarantee steady employment to a dish- washing convict who was guilty of a few bad checks and who drank now and then. No takers. For a week I spent most of my time meeting with restaurant owners and managers of construction companies. They were all encouraging but no one was willing to sign a paper guaranteeing Johnny a job. Then we thought of the home-base solution. Har- vard University was one of the largest businesses in Cambridge. Dozens of dining halls. We visited the Harvard employment office. There the officials were most sympathetic. Their interest led them to visit the prison. They listened attentively to the discus- sion about sessions and in return gave brief lectures about hard work, honesty, and responsibility. But for Johnny there was no help because the month was May and the Harvard dining halls closed for the summer. There was nothing to do but hire Johnny our- selves. Take him into the family business. A letter was written on the stationery of the Harvard Center for Personality Research, guaranteeing him a job on our project. We located a room in Cam- bridge, paid the rent, and Johnny had a home. With these documentary testaments to middle- class support, Johnny was released. Our first recon- verted man was on the streets."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Spring 1961 00 203 When he reported to work for the research proj- ect, his first assignment was to find himself a job and to keep diary notes of his job-hunting. At five o'clock each afternoon he would return to the center with his report. The only jobs he could get were in large downtown cafeterias where he would be allowed to join that anonymous army of gray-faced, dead-eyed, muscatel-drinking drifters who clear dishes off tables and mop floors today and are gone tomorrow to the drunk-tank. Such a job was guaranteed to push him into alcoholism. And every day at five-thirty Johnny would leave our office and go to his rented room, anonymous body on an impersonal bed in a strange chamber. The bars had TV and warmth and companionship. For two weeks he continued to search, made endurable by the support of the graduate students who hung out in the project office (at least there were some people who knew and cared ) . And then came a job as apprentice baker in a pizza parlor. It was a small shop where he would be known by everyone, where he would be a person. When Johnny came back from work the first evening, we all listened to his description of the place, what the girl cashier looked like, what the boss said to him, what his duties were. We passed the story on to the cons at the prison, and they listened carefully to all the details. There was still the bad business of Johnny living by himself and having no friends. The only thing that he could do after work was hang out in the bar. This was expensive. It was also dangerous- leading to hangovers and oversleeping. But Johnny didn't know any other way of spend- ing time or money. Free dollars and free hours automatically went to the saloon. The ideas of saving money, of purchasing anything except im- mediate essentials, of taking a vacation, of planning a career were as foreign to Johnny as to an Austra- lian bushman. Middle-class behavior was as far removed from his experience as life on Mars. So let's emigrate Johnny to Mars. Let's expose him to the day-to-day routine of middle-class Amer- ican life where he could learn by observation. Johnny moved into my house, into the third-floor attic that Bill Burroughs had just vacated. There is one time I remem- ber falling upward towards a mass of designs and it was all different colors or lights. It may sound nutty but I was there. I see other human beings in a different light. I seem to place everyone on an equal level. Regardless of race, creed, or color and education. I have never found it dif- ficult to talk with most people. However, after the mushroom experience I find it much easier. What can it do for others? I don't know. I will say this however, if the mushroom leaves the same impression on others as it has on me, then I suggest that every- one should be confronted with its virtues."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"204 00 The Prisoners Will Become Priests The main thing I received from my first experience with mushrooms, was to look at myself and the en- tire human race from a dif- ferent angle. One of friend- liness and sincerity. Not what I can do everyone out of but what I can do for them and with them. I hope to find deeper and clearer meanings to these other things the next time I take the mushroom. . . . By nature, I am a very rest- less person. Always want- ing to move. Yes, I would even go as far as to say wanderlust. I couldn't sit still if someone was talking to me and most of the time it would bore me to listen to them talk. Since the mushroom, I don't feel that way. I seem to be more re- laxed. Less impatient. I want to listen and I don't want to be moving around. To get away from the things around me, now, seems to have vanished. Then I was scared. I thought someone had pulled a trick on me and the little man disappeared. I thought to myself, someone has dubbed the record with their voice, someone who I don't know, someone very clever in his trickery. Some- one wanted to hypnotize me, make me the living, speaking dead. Then I real- ized that I had seen this little green man before in my last trip. Johnny was a congenial householder. Jolly with kids. Easy with adults. He'd come home from work every night about midnight and have a beer and tell us about the pizza parlor. When the parole officer would drop around to make his surprise visits, the fibers of the house braced in empathetic protection. We were all mem- bers of a benign conspiracy to keep Johnny out of jail. For the first time in his life he had a home and a protective family. But the price was expensive. It took commitment, caring, concern, sharing. An emotional thing that can't be taught in the professional schools or ob- tained by voting large appropriations for criminal rehabilitation. Back in prison the program went on. Psychedelic trips, two or three a week. Moments of confronta- tion. Moments of terror. Moments of joy. We were using the prison as a training center. The convicts were learning how to guide psyche- delic drug sessions. Harvard graduate students were coming to go through the program themselves. There was less distinction between psychologists and inmates. The new Harvards were assigned to veteran inmates for orientation and guidance. In session after session the inmates guided the Harvards, and the Harvards guided the convicts. The energy generated by the sessions continued to spill out beyond the prison walls. The psilocybin session room became a show place. Whenever visi- tors came to Cambridge inquiring about psyche- delic drugs, we took them out to the prison. The convicts sat around the table giving lectures on their mystic experiences to Gerald Heard and Alan Watts and Aldous Huxley and the ex-King of Sara- wak and coveys of visiting psychiatrists. The instinctive strategy was to do everything possible to enhance self-esteem, pride, and sense of accomplishment. Every power we could turn over to the convicts was a fiber in the body of growth we were constructing. As in any tribe there were sectors of friction, resentment, and disappointments. Johnny O'Connell lost his job when the pizza parlor went out of business. For a few days he"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"206 00 The Prisoners Will Become Priests The last Indian record came on and I closed my eyes, nothing, no color, nothing at all. I opened my eyes and felt very dizzy, so I closed my eyes again. All of a sudden a vision came unto me. Waver of sound, strings waving with sound, the music its very strings danced before me. The strings were gold, bright and brilliant. A voice came from the strings mystical and God- like in its tone, precise in its pronunciation, faraway and abstract in its meaning to me. Then I saw the little green man again, emerald green, robe about him, long legs and arms wrapped about himself, bald head shining with light, long thin ears, bright green eyes, sly wide grinning mouth. He had gold earrings in his ear, long, thin eyebrows and darker and a little beard growing from his chin. He spoke of the mu- sic, of the very strings he sat upon. looked for a new job and then he took to sitting around the house watching television and drinking beer all day. We tried LSD. Heavier and heavier doses, with no results. Johnny always treated psy- chedelics with the bravado of the Olympic booze champion. I can outdrink any man in the house. His pride was to prove he could take more and more sacrament without passing out. So one afternoon we gave him five times the normal dose of LSD. Johnny flipped out of his mind and spun up to heaven. He raved about the beauty. He laughed with joy. He saw it all. How do you like heaven, Johnny? The answer was straight one-hundred-proof Irish. Tell God he's flubbed his job, Doc, there's no beer joint in heaven. So we bundled up in overcoats to take Johnny to a bar. We thought he might see through the booze scene. He walked into the bar with bravado, but it was too much for him. The bottles leered and mocked. Gotta get the hell out of here. Later that night he went back to the bar, ordered a beer, and turned to the man next to him. Mister, you'll never believe where I went today and what I saw. The man next to him didn't believe him. Neither did Johnny. The next day he was back to TV and beer. My irritation grew but Johnny couldn't be moved. I gave him a week to find a job and then I gave him fifty dollars and told him he was on his own. In two weeks he was back in prison not for crime, because Johnny wasn't a criminal, but for idleness and beering. By the fall of 1962 we had over thirty-five con- victs and fifteen Harvards in the group. And the men started being paroled out to the streets two and three a month. True fellowship among men must be based on a concern that is universal. It is not the private interests of the individual that create lasting fellow- ship among men, but rather the goals of humanity. That is why it is said that fellowship with men in the open succeeds. ( I Ching XIII )"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Spring 1961 00 207 We started project contact. The ex-cons and the Harvards were signed up in buddy-system teams to visit the ex-cons in their homes. We'd drive around the slum areas of Brockton, Fall River, Worcester, looking for our man. Then we'd go out and have a beer and find out how he was doing. There was a twenty-four-hour telephone to rush help in case of emergencies. Maxwell found himself broke, his wife leaving him, and ready to knock over a store in rage and frustration. He'd phone our number and someone would drive over to meet him and spend an hour talking to him in an all-night cafeteria and lend him ten dollars. We bailed them out of jail, sobered them up, hid them from the parole officer, cooled out angry bosses. We did in short what the family does for its confused members. And we kept them out of jail. By this time operation Keep-Out had become a three-ring circus. There was the prison. There was the outside contact project and there was the less visible but equally important task of keeping the state administrators and officials happy. We kept a steady flow of memoranda and progress reports to the myriad departments which focus a jealous eye on the work of rehabilitating criminals. It was clear to us that if a week went by without contacting the bureaucrats, clewing them in, mak- ing them a part of the game, the whistle would be blown on our game. What we were doing was highly implausible from the administrative point of view. Week after week for two years we ran ecstasy sessions in a state prison turning-on with the prisoners, turning- on visiting psychiatrists. We had converted the hospital ward into a spiritual center complete with incense candles and music. We did this with the approval of the most skepti- cal, wary group of politician-pros on the American scene cops, jailers, and parole officials. Our key was direct human contact. I spent one-third of my time in face-to-face interaction with the state offi- cials. We invited them to the prison. We spent long hours over the lunch table, long hours driving to I could only see part of his face, a small pointed beard covered his cheeks and chin, his eyes glowed with a yellow light and his nose was long and thin. He seemed to be speaking but I could not hear him. Maybe he was praying. I spoke to him, \"Hey man, what are you doing here. I know you. I saw you before on a mountain.\" No answer. I could not help talking jive talk, abstract words. Then the vision disap- peared and did not return. A criminal, at least myself and most all I've ever met, were either unloved chil- dren or lost individuals. Lost between right and wrong. What they wanted and the means to it. They knew their ends, power, wealth, money could not buy friends, loved ones, happiness, beauty, intelli- gence. I saw how foolish the game I played was. Just saw thru it, saw the ends I would find, instead of the ends I'd imagined. It sick- ened me. What was life, a life of this kind, just misery for myself and those who loved me."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"208 00 The Prisoners Will Become Priests I again asked what I wanted from life and at once I got an answer love, peace, plenty, intelligence, not power, but friends. I reached the top. There was the same rock, the soft- ness of it is still here. On this rock was a man. A man both young and old. He had about his slim body a liquid robe of the bluest blue. He had his hands folded in his lap. His fingers seemed to glow. They were long and bony and his hands seemed slim and fine. He was looking into the sky and did not hear me. He had long, womanlike hair, smooth and shiny and black, coal black. It has a way that moves me and relaxes me and through this relaxation I find myself in a much better atmos- phere, and also put myself into better environment, which in the future will prove how great psilocybin really is. the state house and to the probation headquarters. A lunch at the Harvard Faculty Club for the Com- missioner of Correction and his top lieutenants. Sharing of space-time. Caring for them, caring for their opinions and for their approval. We even ran sessions for parole officers and correction officials. Some of them had unhappy trips. People committed to external power are frightened by the release of ecstasy because the key is surrender of external power. One chief parole officer flipped-out paranoid at my house and ac- cused us of a Communist conspiracy and stormed around while Madison Presnell curled up on the couch watching, amused at the white folks franti- cally learning how to get high. He grinned at me. So you call it the love drug? But the next day the parole officer looked back at where he had been and his voice shook in reverence. The administrators let the project go on for the same reason that administrators do anything fear of criticism. Our work was succeeding and the prisoners knew it. Not just the inmates at Concord but all over the state. The politicians had to go along with it. Harvard was backing the project and Harvard couldn't be flouted. But there was an underlying skepticism. A basic distrust about any enthusiastic new approach to prisoner rehabilitation. Let them try their newfangled experiment, but the old hands knew that cons are cons and nothing can change them. In politics and administration the great sin is idealism, bright-eyed vigor and the highest virtue is cynicism. Faith, hope, and charity are dirty words. Nothing really changes except who has the power, who has the money. Everyone in the Massachusetts correctional sys- tem believed in his heart that our project would fail. That we would not lower the recidivism rate, that we could not convert hardened criminals. We just couldn't do it because we were running against the cultural momentum of American society which is more laws, more cops, more lawyers, more judges, more prison psychiatrists, more control, and we were saying: give power away.

Deep religious commitments were involved in the use of our little pill. I came into the warden's office one morning to report the most recent statistics. We had kept twice as many convicts out on the street as the expected number. We had halved the crime rate. He listened politely but he kept glancing toward the corner of the room. When I finished he got up and clapped me on the back and led me to the corner. Look at that, he said proudly. It was an architect's color drawing of a super prison. Look. Two football fields. This wing is for admitting and orientation. Two more cell blocks. Mess halls double in size. We'll have capacity for twice as many inmates and we can double the staff all the way down the line. His eyes were glowing like anyone showing you his dream plan. Success. His fantasy was coming true. A prison and an organizational table twice as big! The bureaucrats' goal. But warden, you're not going to need a larger prison. His face registered surprise. Why not? Be- cause we're cutting your recidivism rate in half, remember. You won't need to have all the cells you have now. You won't need to have half the guards you now have, if you let us turn-on your prison. The warden laughed. He liked me and felt pro- tective toward our hopes. Well, we're getting some of your men back. Kelly returned today in hand- cuffs. He was one of your men, wasn't he? Yes, Kelly had come back to the prison and so were some others returning. They had not com- mitted new crimes. They were returning cheerfully, peacefully, quietly, not making it on the outside. Dropping-out. Kelly was a good example. He had been paroled and went back to the slum housing project where his wife and four children awaited him. He walked in on a financial crisis. The state support money for families of prisoners stopped the day he got out. He had no job. Five reproachful mouths to feed. His relations with his wife, never good, had been further strained by his imprisonment. His occupa- tional assets, never good, were weakened by his prison record. Under psilocybin I have taken on a different atti- tude toward people and friends. I was always dif- ferent in manner and just the opposite of what this drug brought out. Impulse has been the main factor in my doing things and through these impulses I have been incarcerated, but I am looking for a way to turn away from impulse. As I was laying in the bed with the blanket over my head, I kept getting these wonderful feelings, all through my body. I can't explain how they felt, but they felt so good that I was hoping that they would last all day, but they didn't. For a little while after that, I went through a great deal of suffering.

It was then that I seemed to be fighting something, when Dr. Presnell came over to me and took the blankets off my head. I had felt then that he had just saved my life. I got up to go to the bath- room, and I got a little dizzy. Everything that I saw, and the color of them seemed to be more intense. After I came out of the bathroom, I went over to one of the windows and looked out. I was feeling very happy. Dr. Leary came over to me and asked me how I felt. I told him I felt free. As soon as I said that, the happi- ness left me. I started to think what I was free from. I looked around the room, and for the first time, I no- ticed the bars on the win- dows. Kelly was plunged, ill-prepared, into a tense, frustrating, almost hopeless situation. The pride and enthusiasm and insight of his psychedelic sessions were eroding fast. Our outside contact team met with him and tried to get him a job. Kelly was hard to sell to an employer. Now, if you put yourself into Kelly's head, you get this perspective. The outside society of Boston is cold, demanding, degrading, inhospitable, heavy with responsibility, empty of reward. Kelly looks back at the prison, free food and lodging and a job. There, he is a wanted man. He has a place. A role. But more than that, in the prison is the warmth of the group, the pride of belonging to the mushroom- elite, the rare unexpected ecstasy and adventure of the psychedelic drug trip, the companionship. The session room was home. Like a hummingbird, Kelly starting circling back to Concord. It was so easy. Just be drinking beer when the parole officer comes to inspect, and sound unenthusiastic about getting a job. Sorry, Kelly, but we have to pull your parole. You're going back. Kelly was going home, back to his cellmates. The problem was that the close tribal fabric of the prison group was pulled apart in the city. Everything in the Boston culture was geared to push Kelly back to crime. We needed a tribal center, a halfway house. A place in Boston where the ex-cons could reinstate the closeness of the prison group. The tribal tie has to be strong to protect its people in the brutal anonymity of the city. We started looking around for a house to rent. We ran into the usual problems. Landlords turned off when they learned that we were planning a center for ex-convicts. We didn't have the money or the energy to set up a house. It was obvious that we would have to live in the house ourselves with the ex-cons. Sit around the homefire with them, become inmates with them, and we weren't ready to make that big step of love and commitment.

They kept getting closer and closer. I got scared. I looked around the room for some place to hide. I didn't hide. I decided to face it.

I had obtained a supply of this drug synthesized by a chemist friend in London. My first impression was that it closely resembled psilocybin in its effects. I had taken it perhaps ten times (this drug must be injected and the dose is about one grain but I had been assured that there was a wide margin of safety) with results some- times unpleasant but well under control and always interesting when the horri- ble experience occurred which I have recorded and submitted for publication in Encounter. You've got to write a big, enthusiastic letter to Burroughs and get him interested in taking the mushrooms. He knows more about drugs than any- one alive. What a report he'll write you! This was Allen Ginsberg talking in the winter of 1960-61, but it could have been any of a dozen other advisors. Burroughs is the Man. He knows the drug scene from head to heel. Allen Ginsberg left a copy of Junky, a hard- bitten, powerful account of the 1950 drug scene in New York. Written by Burroughs under the pseu- donym William Lee, the book is so real it stinks of subways-late-at-night, and the stale must of Eighth Avenue hotels, the sickening odor of benzedrine, and the dry sweat of tenement sexuality. The last lines of Junky announced the author's intention to pur- sue the hallucinogenic grail to South America. \"Kick is momentary freedom from the claims of the aging, cautious, frightened flesh. Yage may be the final fix.\" Yage is a vine, Ayahuasca or Banisteriopsis Caape, found in the Amazon regions of Peru and Colombia which Ginsberg described as a telepathic- hallucinogenic-mind-expanding drug used by Ama- zon Indian doctors for finding lost objects, mostly bodies and souls. In 1953 Burroughs had made the trip to Bogota, Pasto, Macon, and then to Peru on the trail of visions. Now, seven years later, he was in Paris experimenting with hallucinations produced by flicker machines. What has been spoiled through mans fault can be made good again through mans work.

He has taken Bannisteriopsis and is most interested in experiments with the hallucinogens. In reply I sent a supply of psilocybin pills to the world's most experienced experimenter on drugs and awaited a report. His report was surprising. Burroughs had a bad trip on DMT and was sound- ing the cry of urgent warning. We studied the letter with considerable interest and got a wide variety of interpretations. We had learned enough to know that set-and-setting deter- mined the reaction, not the drug. Bill Burroughs alias Doctor Benway had inadver- tently taken an overdose of DMT and was flung into a space-fiction paranoia. Shortly after receiving the warning, I wrote ask- ing Burroughs if he would participate in a sympo- sium of psychedelic drugs which we had arranged for the September 1961 meetings of the American Psychological Association. I was impressed with Burroughs' experimental bent, the rigor and sternness of his declaration about precise research. We were intrigued by the idea of the great novelist I am sending along to you pertinent sections of this manuscript and I think you will readily see the danger involved. I do not know if you are fa- miliar with apomorphine which is the only drug that acts as a metabolic regu- lator.

We offered to pay travel expenses for the trip to New York and asked Burroughs if he wanted to spend some time in Cambridge after the symposium. The answer came back, Sure. In July of that summer I went to Tangier to see Allen Ginsberg and to plan the conference with Burroughs. After the plane from Madrid pulled up to the Tangier air terminal, we were held up for fifteen minutes while the family of the King passed to another waiting airplane, emblazoned with Arabic script and regal emblems. More than a dozen women in veils picked their way daintily across the runway guarded by police and soldiers. Over at the terminal behind the rail, a man with long blond hair waved and shouted. It was Peter Orlovsky, leaving in half an hour for Gibraltar, then to Athens and the far, far East. He was sick of Tangier and didn't like what was going on there. He had quarreled with Burroughs, and was off to find wise men and wild drugs in the East. Til take drugs you've never heard of! Morgenlandfahrt. Have a good trip, Peter.

The session began in Burroughs' room, dim-lit, unmade bed, crowded, smoky. Burroughs lay back on the bed. The English boys watched him. The rest of us walked out to the garden and looked over the wall down on Tangier Harbor. Allen was de- pressed over Peter's departure. What did Peter say? How did he seem? He was struggling with Bur- roughs. Burroughs is anti-love. It so happened that the Boyal Fair was in town and the King's picture was draped over wires at every street intersection, and we could see the fairground ablaze with lights down near the beach and hear the sound of drums and pipes. It was the essence of night, warm, clear, hung on a ledge above North Africa's port, Moorish music drifting up to us watching. Allen Ansen and Gregory Corso were grinning and we all looked at each other and breathed in deeply. Whew! Pure, burnished ecstasy. Allen Ginsberg said that Burroughs seemed to want to be quiet, so why didn't we go over to his place and watch the night from there.

Lights strung from the rigging of ships in the harbor and the King's carni- val crazily rollicking along by the water's edge. We were all in the highest and most loving of moods. Allen Ansen couldn't believe it. He kept laughing and shaking his head. This can't be true. So beautiful. Heaven! But where is the devil's price? Anything this great must have a terrible flaw in it. It can't be this good. Is it addictive? Will we ever come down? I hope not. I was answering the questions that Allen and Gregory asked about the research and what had been happening in the States. Comic, Zen, mush- roomy talk. The four of us moored like happy balloons over Tangier. Joy. Love. Union. It was decided to pick up Burroughs and then go down to visit the fair. When we got to Burroughs' house, Allen walked around to the side and climbed part way up the wall and uttered his ritual greeting: Bill BUH-rows! Bill BUH-rows! We waited by the door and after a minute it slowly creaked open and there, almost collapsed against the wall, was Bill. His face was haggard and tense staring out like man caught in some power of Sammy the Butcher. He reached his left hand over his sweating face. Tried to slip out eyes of white-hot crab creatures. His thin fingers clawing at the right cheek, smoke escape cut off by white- hot metal lattice. Bill, how are you doing? They gave me large dose. I would like to sound a word of warning. I'm not feeling too well. I was struck by juxtaposition of purple fire mushroomed from the Pain Banks. Urgent Warning. I think I'll stay here in shriveling envelopes of larval flesh.

Oh, see the conquering art of Moorish slave girls crowned with diadems. What a happy crowd! Dancing with lively, mocking sound, blue tattoos on forehead. Happy night walking to the fair.

Moors use water in their architecture because to a desert people the splashing sound and rippling sight of fountains is the highest delight. The dance tempo quickened to a Niagara chaos of sound and high- raised couches. Consorts have we created and we have made them virgins. On low stairs leading up to the stage a Moorish maid beams out curious, flirting look from olive slits behind a gray veil, utterly loving and perfectly matched we have made them.

I said good night to Burroughs and walked up the hill with Allen and Gregory and stayed up the rest of the night talking on Allen's patio and heard the cocks crow and saw the sun rise and gleam on the eastern walls of the city by the gates. During the following days in Morocco I shot reels of retinal film Tangerine. At Paul Bowles's apart- ment I heard his tapes of Arab music, recorded as he walked down old village dancing festival streets, and a tape of Burroughs reading his stuff at an English University powerful, eerie, Venusian prose. Minutes to go. No one has captured the horror of modern technology like Burroughs cold damp machinery, the television mind, cold, blue- steel sexuality, plastic bodies drained of the warm juices. I watched a session in which several young English boys took majoun (the powerful hashish jam). One of them got caught in bad visions. I could see why. He played the part of a miserable, bullied, self-despising English schoolboy homo- sexual. He had walked in on the session uninvited and had tagged along unwanted. Then suddenly he found himself \"out of his mind\" in a strange port city amid strangers who disliked him, and he trembled in fear. I watched to see how the drug- experts would handle the situation. For the most part he was ignored. He's a drag, man. Give him a sedative. There was little compassion in the honey- sweet majoun syrup. Only Allen Ginsberg was ten- der, sitting next to him and talking softly, curan- dero style. When I left Tangier for Copenhagen, I arranged to meet Bill Burroughs in London in three weeks. Dick Alpert and I phoned Bill and then took a cab to his hotel. He had a small, dark, first-floor room with a meter on the wall. Bill misses kif. Poring over photos of yage convulsions.

Your national and racial origins are preserved, alive, in your neurological and cellular equipment. The basic messages of blood and sperm are experienced in every detail of daily life. Awareness of, and delicate sensitivity to, their ancient styles facilitate harmonious tribal living and rewarding inter-tribal contact. Ignorance of racial and sexual tendencies breeds chaos. Civilized people are tribal people. Urban people are usually blind to the essence differences which give glorious variety to organic existence and human life.

So may I introduce to you Bristly, formal, English accent. Dr. Leary, Mi- chael Hollingshead here. I have been working with Professor G. E.

Lunch? Quite so, that would be fine. Lunch next week Tuesday. Fine. The fact youve known for all these years Michael turned out to be a series of surprises. Medium height, medium bald, medium-aged man of thirty. His voice was urbane. His face twinkling, aristocratic and somehow gross. He don't really want to top the show But I thought that you might like to know That the singers going to write a wrong Lunch at the Faculty Club was boring. He had little to say about G. E. Moore. He drank two bottles of beer. There was something evasive about the conversation. As lunch ended he told me that he was a writer, just finishing a novel. Oh, what's it about? May I have a minute to tell you? Go ahead. The novel is about a bank clerk whose ambition in life was to levitate.

For years he meditated and practiced in his room, to no avail. Then one day at the bank, standing behind the tellers window, counting pounds, shillings, and pence, he found himself lifting slowly from the floor. A half-inch, an inch, two inches, he closed his eyes and let himself drift. When he opened his eyes he was two feet above the floor just about to soar up beyond the grill. With quick presence of mind he reached for the top ledge and arrested his upward motion. Quickly he yanked himself down to the ground, glanced around nervously to make sure nobody had seen him, and stood there perspir- ing, shaking, frightened, and exulting. After a minute he experimentally released his grasp on the counter and felt his shoes leaving the ground. He reached down again and with his left hand shoved the window-closed sign forward. After five minutes he felt something click in his head. He let go of the counter and felt the reassuring pull of gravity hold his feet to the floor. He thought of nothing else that night. At the same hour the next day, while he was counting out pounds, shillings, and pence, he felt energy surging through his body, and quietly the room began to slide downward. For the next fifteen minutes he carried on his work with one foot hooked under- neath the bottom bar of the calculating machine. That night at home, through meditation deep- ened by yoga, he tried to duplicate the levitation, but nothing happened. The following day, how- ever, just after lunch, it happened again and this time, to his horror, it persisted. Fifteen minutes, twenty minutes, a half-hour, an hour, he clung to the window with one foot wedged under the calcu- lating machine. He was suffused with a feeling of lightness. Delightful electrical forces surged through his body. A feeling of exultation and reve- lation washed over him, but under all was the nagging worry, what was he going to do? If he relaxed, gave in to the ecstatic flow, he knew that he would slowly spiral upward in his white shirt and flowered tie, and charcoal-gray business suit, before the astonished and angry eyes of the bank employees, and the customers.

The lawn was in a terrible state, with weeds all over the place and large patches of dried grass which called attention to the many months of neglect by the previous tenants. As it was, our difficulties were further complicated by an almost total lack of proper equipment; indeed, were it not for palm leaves, which we used in place of rakes, I doubt whether we could have made much progress. However, working against the clock, we hope to have the place tidied up before the Independence celebra- tions begin, on August 6. Others, less attentive to floral decoration but more efficient in matters of grow- ing plants, have had a cer- tain amount of difficulty re- cently from the authorities."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"236 00 The Drop-Out Drug I understand that ganja, an Arawak word for pot, is il- legal here.

Warmest regards to you, Michael 00 bling, he went through the routines of business until closing time, his right foot holding him to the floor. Then grasping the counter so that his knuckles blanched white with the force, he slowly and delib- erately walked the rectilinear path to the corner of the room. Quickly switching with his left hand to grab a table top he turned to the door. There was one agonizing space between the desk and the door where there was nothing to hold onto. He bent down, pretending to tie his shoelaces, and, with a sudden leap launched himself and soared to the doorknob, which he was only just able to catch with his right hand as he floated past. The rest of the trip home to his apartment was an ecstatic nightmare. Never was the sky so blue. His eyes were microscopes registering the jewel-like beauty and precision of the sidewalks, and lamp posts. He was a fish swimming in a diamond- studded, colorful lagoon. But a fish with one in- cessant problem. How to avoid floating up through the energy-charged watery environment when his role and social duty was obviously to crawl crablike along the lagoon bottom. Holding on to a street light, he hailed a cab. A quick transfer of hands to the taxi door. Finally into his living room where he roped himself to his sofa. He phoned the office to announce a two-week sick leave. A call to his fiancee to come at once. He had, it seemed, been courting a beautiful young woman for several months. A certain caution and heavy seriousness on his part inclined her to resist his advances. But now he announced that he had taken leave of his job, perhaps not to return, and that he was headed for an isolated lake in the country. Fascinated, she agreed to go with him. Here perhaps was the casual and careless lover she would prefer. Their room in the country inn had a balcony which opened onto the lake below. They dined there with candlelight, the champagne glasses glit- tering in the flickering flame. The meal ended and with a caressing, wrenching kiss, she moved to the bathroom, sending back a glance at the four-poster bed. He undressed quickly with one hand holding the mattress. She emerged from the bathroom naked, hair loose around her"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Fall 1961 00 237 shoulders, and he reached out his hands to embrace her. And then, softly, tenderly, gently turning like a balloon on a summer afternoon at the sky park, he floated up, up, beyond her outstretched arms and her beautiful face now transfigured with awe and terror. Up, up, to the ceiling where with an easy jolt he found himself pinned. Michael Hollingshead was leaning forward with his head somewhat bowed, his eyes down, his fingers making little marks on the table cloth. My cigarette, untouched, had an inch-long ash. Michael glanced up. His eyes caught mine. A sudden look of amused despair. He shrugged his shoulders and raised his hands in studied helplessness. I must apologize, my dear chap. I didn't mean to go on boring you this way. Don't be silly. Please go on. A soft smile rippled across Michael's face. He nodded and dropped his head again. She stood below, aching, naked and vulnerable. First upset, and disbelieving. Then, as he ex- plained, lying on his back on the ceiling, his arms gesticulating downward, she became intrigued, de- lighted. After two hours she was sitting on a chair with her legs crossed, smoking and crushing cigarettes out in the ash tray. He lay on the ceiling, eyes closed, filmy with sweat, concentrating, willing, meditating. Finally, she moved briskly to the bath- room and emerged fully dressed. She paused at the door, Call me, when you're ready to come down, she said. And she was gone. His arms waved after her like tree limbs in a wind storm. He lay spread-eagled against the white, ash-gray, paint-flaking ceiling. And then the tears fell and collected in two little pools on the bed below. By this time I was half an hour late to a faculty meeting, and as we rushed back along the Cam- bridge streets, Michael quickly and with a certain frantic pressure, talked to me about LSD experi- ments he had been doing in New York with a doctor. The importance of psychedelic drugs. He wanted something from me but I sloped off with a quick handshake. Fascinating lunch. I loved your book and your story. Let's do it again. I forgot about the episode. The following Thurs- MICHAEL HOLLINGSHEAD: 19 Brampton Square London, SW3 1st Nov. 1962 My dear Timothy, I received a letter from the Parapsychology Foundation this morning, cutting me off their payroll. It seems that they were sur- prised that you were sur- prised to be informed by them that I had a grant to write a paper on your set- and-setting theories, etc. and also of their help in getting me back to England from Jamaica. I think it is now my turn to be surprised, for my letters to you explained all of this; in fact, in my August letter I recall having asked you to read through the MS before I submitted it. However, the issue here is not whether I deceived you or not, or even how you view what I think about the Harvard-Concord project it is your persistent refer- ence, to other people, and most probably to the foun- dation officials as well, to me as a sort of 'con-man' who goes around trying to trick people out of money, or whatever. While this may explain, in a limited way, something about the manner in which I apparently do things, it no more explains the truth of what I really am and what I really am seeking in life than to also say of me that I eat bananas for phal- lic reasons."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"238 00 The Drop-Out Drug Both are valid assumptions in a certain context. As I understand the term, a con-man is someone whose progress in life is founded upon a desire taken for reality to get something for nothing, a person whose behaviour, moral and physi- cal, rests not on seeking to achieve (as the spiritual masters have always af- firmed) in the timeless and eternal 'now,' but in some Utopian future; a person, in brief, who lives through the present because of the prospect of that golden age to come. But it also assumes some kind of criminal or nasty intent. When I met you I had just got back from a month of horror and emptiness in Houston, was being tempted by my wife to settle again in New York but on very different terms than form- erly and was broke and needing a job. You were very kind to me at a point when nothing seemed to be going for me, and I shall always be grate- ful. day I had a busy schedule a lecture to an ad- vanced seminar of undergraduates, from ten to twelve, and then a one-o'clock plane from Boston to New York. After the lecture I rushed to the office and found my secretary standing with a peculiar look on her face, handing me a letter. It was written in tiny, hardly legible script. He had spent the week living alone in a dreary room in Cambridge. He had come to Harvard because I was the only person in the world who could help him. He knew how vulgar and gamelike his ploy might seem, that he would kill himself if I could not see him and help him, but the insight into his own vulgarity was simply an added wound to a riddled and desperate organism. He would await my call at the rooming house number until five that afternoon. And after that, good luck and good-bye. Well, this was a pretty crisis, coming when I had exactly twenty minutes before leaving for the airport. I dispatched George Litwin, who was part of what we at that time called our Love Engineer Group, to pick up Michael at his rooming house. The plan was that I could talk to him on the way to my plane. They were back immediately. With George at the wheel, and Michael in the back seat we headed for the airport. The immediate problem seemed simple enough. He was broke, without a job, separated from his wife and child for financial reasons. Are you sure that's all? I asked. He looked at me once again with the amused horror look, and shrugged, Well, there are all the cosmic problems, of course, but if I could get a base with my wife and family I'd feel up to dealing with the rest. That sounded fair enough, so a quick plan was evolved. Michael could take my car and drive to New York, pick up his wife that very evening and come back. They could stay on the third floor of my house. His wife could be housekeeper until he got a job. I could sense in Michael's body a subtle relief, like a poker player whose bluff had not been called. When we arrived at the airport, Michael followed and pulled me aside for a minute between the car and the Eastern Airlines door. There's one thing I should tell you. I know you have friends in New York. I know you're a friend of Winston London,"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Fall 1961 00 239 and I think you should know that for the last six months I have worked very closely with him. We parted on very bad terms. He'll say wicked things about me which I'm sure you're sophisticated enough to realize emerge from his state of con- sciousness rather than the realities of mine. In- triguing, but I was in too much of a hurry to pursue it. Winston London was a famous New York multimillionaire with a good heart and ten- derly high-minded ideals. He was continually being victimized by fourth-rate low-level promoters. Cpl Michael's Lonely Dope Club Band The fact you've known for all these years In New York I went first to the East Side apart- ment of Max Fox, a five-hundred-year-old teen-age Levantine confidant at the Sultan's court, some- times in favor, sometimes in disgrace. Always wise, shrewd, funny, complaining, completely involved in extravagant baroque plans to turn-on the Sultan, to turn-on the harem, to turn-on himself. In his current casting Max was a Hollywood publicity man. Friend and adviser to the most beautiful women in New York. Max's delight was to drive around in a chauffeured Cadillac with two tall slender blondes, champagne cooler, stereo- phonic sound, and the ashtrays loaded with Panama red. Until the bills came due and the Cadillac no longer drew up to his door. There was never a shortage of interesting men and beautiful girls in Max's flat. He performed one of the most valuable social functions in any complex urban society. His apartment was communications center for the most interesting people in New York. The price of admission was beauty or power or talent. And you were never allowed to promote or come on. That, after all, was the privilege of the house. It's wonderful to be there It's certainly a mill So many lovely customers Max met me at the door. As I walked to the sofa I remembered that Winston London was one of his friends. Max, can you do me a favor? I've just met a man whom I'm about to get involved with. He says he knows Winston London. And there seems to be some friction in the relationship. Could And when I knew you better I told you about the insti- tute business in New York, detailing the passage of events which culminated in having to face and deal with the New York gang- sters. What I didn't tell you it seemed rather flat after the stories of nightly visits from the juke-box czar was that I always used the institute to do for others what the Parapsychology Foundation did for me. And there was also room in the institute for 'improb- able' people like beatniks, paintingless painters, bar- room pundits, and, with the contrivance of the editor of The Hobo News, for old men who only vaguely knew where they were at and needing some funds. Why, then, should I also have got myself involved with people like the gang- sters. Why not? Why, too, should I bother with hobos, millionaires, Harvard psychologists, and impecunious art students. The answer is that I do like people and there is the corollary, I want people to like me."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"240 00 The Drop-Out Drug While in general I am a happy person I spend my life and earn my living do- ing what I want to do bits have been chipped off my heart these past twelve months.

But I fail to understand why you should want to do so. you get a line on that for me? Max was delighted. He reached for a phone and dialed a number. It was a delicatessen owned and operated by a former bodyguard of Winston London. First there was a conversation about a case of Scotch and some salami and cheese. Max's voice and the voice of the invisible bodyguard crackled through the room from a special telephone amplifier system. The slightest whisper on the phone would be heard in loud volume in any part of the apartment. After the ordering, Max got down to business. Tony, do you by chance know anything about a fellow named Hollingshead? Says he used to know Winston. There was a brief pause and then tough gangster prose came booming out of the amplifier. Hollings- head, that no-good, two-bit, English con man. Lis- ten, what do you have to do with him? Whatever it is, drop it. Max's voice came back calming, ex- plaining that he was doing a favor for a friend. Tony's voice continued. Listen, that scoundrel caused Winston more trouble than any ten of the last con men that have come down Fifth Avenue. He's got a record on the continent as long as your arm. He's wanted by Interpol. He's bad news, buddy. Stay away from that Hollingshead. The one and only Silly Fears Max turned to me pleased with the efficiency of his intelligence service. Well, that's the end of that character. I'm not so sure, Max. That's just the opinion of one guy, a nice enough person, no doubt, but one whose spiritual focus may leave something to be desired. Let me get another read- ing on him from someone else. I reached for the phone and dialed George Litwin, back in Cam- bridge. George was going to take Michael back to his home for dinner before he started out in my car for New York, and I wanted to get George's im- pressions about this mysterious stranger. In a few seconds George's voice reverberated through the room. What happened with Michael, I said. George's words, chuckling, energetic, always en- thusiastic, bouncing around the room.

Well, Tim, I'm sure that a lot of what this bodyguard says is true. I'm sure that Michael has had a checkered career in the past in situations where money and conning is involved. But what can he possibly con us out of? We have nothing material to lose and our only ambitions are scientific and celes- tial. How can he possibly hurt us? Even if he is a rascal, isn't it our business to rehabilitate people? Can't trust and love applied judiciously bring about any change we want. I say, if we can't work with Michael and use his obvious creativity and enjoy his obvious humor and learn from his experiences, we might as well go back to the run-of-the-mill business of college professors.

But I got an uneasy feeling after a while that he was spending his afternoons either in barrooms or high on LSD in the Boston Museum. His wife suddenly announced that she was leaving because of his insistence that she persuade her father to cash in some savings bonds. I remember the scene when the taxi came to pick up Michael's wife and child. We stood an awkward foursome at the door, and as they left, two tears trickled down Michael's face. It was moving, pathetic, poignant, but there was one thread of doubt. Was it an act? If it was, it was so good it could only command respect. In the next few weeks I got to know Michael better, but not much better.

Every fourth night he would ask if he could bring a girl home for dinner. His dates were strange, thin ladies with long hair, whom he would pick up as they browsed through the book stacks. He loved to take psilocybin, although he was patronizing in comparing the mushrooms with LSD, the stronger psychedelic drug which he had used extensively in New York, where a physician friend of his was doing research. He told a funny story about his first LSD experi- ence. He had smoked marijuana and hashish regu- larly and when he heard about LSD he contacted his medical friend and persuaded him to write a research proposal using LSD on amoeba, bacteria, and virus cells. The drug came in a one-gram package. Michael and his friend the doctor puzzled over the problem of how to divide the powdered gram of LSD into the one-hundreth of a million units which made up a standard dose of the incred- ibly powerful drug. They finally decided to mix the drug in powdered sugar which they wet down with water and spread out on a wide piece of wax paper. There were 10,000 doses in a small rectangle of wet sugar on the kitchen table. At first they drew a line down the middle. That made 5,000 on the left and 5,000 on the right. They they cut a line with a knife horizontally to quarter the supply. And then, by continual slices with the knife they divided the stache down to usable doses. They figured that one teaspoon made a double dose. This calibration established, they carefully scooped the paste into jars. When this was finished, there was the problem of what to do with the sticky residue on the wax paper. Michael reached down and tore the sheet of wax paper in half, and stuffed it in his mouth. His friend the doctor did the same. They knew intellectually about the awesome po- tency of LSD.

I would hope that we might preserve some harmony in our relationship by laugh- ing off my dark moods and melodramatic postures. completely unprepared for the effect of what was perhaps ten normal doses. The effect hit suddenly, and for five hours the two of them lay back para- lized on kitchen chairs, their eyes bulging, com- pletely severed from theif bodies, from their minds, from normal reality. Helplessly spinning through cosmic landscapes, unable to speak or move, com- municating only by a shining powerless eyeball contact, like two astronauts drifting helplessly through space, or two men caught in diving suits miles below the surface. Since that time, Michael's consciousness, his thinking and his actions, were nothing but exten- sions of that trip. He had died, spun out into the richness of interior space, had unraveled the riddle of the cosmic joke and was now cautiously, incredu- lously, comically, moving through the marionette show of normal reality. He was very eager for me to take LSD, but I resisted the idea. Everything I had heard about lysergic acid sounded ominous to me. The mush- rooms and peyote had grown naturally in the ground and had been used for thousands of years in wise Indian cultures. LSD, on the other hand, was a laboratory product and had quickly fallen into the hands of doctors and psychiatrists. Then, too, I was scared. The sacred mushrooms were my familiar territory. I had them harnessed up to my brand of revelation and ecstasy. It was obvious that the more powerful LSD swept you far beyond the tender wisdom of psilocybin. Like everyone else, I was both fascinated and frightened by the lysergic lore. Michael invited me one night up to his bedroom and took from his dresser a mayonnaise jar packed with the moist sugar paste. There it is, he said. The key to miracle and meaning. When are you going to take it? I shook my head. I'm having trouble enough understanding the sacred mushrooms. Sometime I'll take your LSD, but I'm not ready now. He laughed.

I had made it a rule that there was to be no grass smoking in the house and they would leave with Michael and turn-on while driving around the neighborhood. They were planning to leave for New York about five o'clock on Sunday afternoon. We were sitting in front of the fireplace, in the living room, and Michael was telling LSD stories. Flo and Maynard's interest perked up. The next thing I knew Michael was bounding downstairs with the mayonnaise jar and a spoon. A tablespoon, I noticed, overflowing. I was listening to records and not paying too much attention, until after about half an hour I looked up and I saw that Maynard and Flo were gone from this world, into some sort of trance. They were sitting on the sofa motionless, their eyes closed. But I could feel energy emanating from their bodies. I turned down the volume on the record player and sat watching them. After about fifteen minutes Flo opened her eyes and she laughed. It was not a nervous or a funny laugh. It was the chuckle of someone who was dead and gone and sitting on some heavenly mountain top and looking down at the two billion years of evolution the way you'd look at a transient episode in a children's playground. She looked at me and began to talk. It was pure advaita vedanta. She was Krishna, lecturing Arjuna. She was reciting, in chuckling, hip Manhattanese, the essence of Hindu philosophy. Maya. Nondual- ity. Reincarnation. And this, mind you, coming from little Flo Ferguson, who hadn't finished high school and had never read a philosophy book in her life. She thought Indians wore headdresses and feathers. Now from her smiling rosebud lips was pouring the most powerful religious statement I had ever heard in my life. Timothy, you've got to take this. Man, it's the beginning and the end. You've got to take it. I looked over and Michael was observing me, carefully, with a smile on his face. He raised his eyebrows and shrugged. Well? I looked at May- nard. He was glowing quietly, smiling and nodding. No doubt remembering mainly our happier mo- ments together, I was gen- uinely surprised when I heard about your conver- sations with the foundation directors. And this may have led me into some egregious blun- der. May we not now look upon all of this as a spiritual ex- ercise I know that I would personally prefer to forget all about it and return to the friendlier, more colourful and positive, status anti- quo.

Tumbling and spinning, down the soft fibrous avenues to some central point which was just light. Just light, but not just light. It was the center of life. A burning, dazzling, throb- bing, radiant core, pure pulsing, exulting light. An endless flame that contained everything sound, touch, cell, seed, sense, soul, sleep, glory, glorifying, God, the hard eye of God. Merged with this puls- ing flame it was possible to look out and see and participate in the entire cosmic drama. Past and future. All forms, all structures, all organisms, all events, were illusory, television productions pulsing out from the central eye.

New York is full of chickens on electric spits. This, say the chickens, is our Auschwitz, and all poul- try keepers are psycho- paths. Far-fetched enough; if such ingenuity were confined to chickens one would hardly object, but it pervades American psychology, blur- ring issues and ideas in a haze of ambiguity every bit as thick as the dripping oil with which those chickens are cooking in windows are baptized one might almost add as methodically sloppy, and the thought as well as the language is always spill- ing over into society and the outside world: a con- venient formula, which seems to cover every sort of human experience, stress or contrast in man's inner and his outer life. This experience is of course endless and inde- scribable. After several billion years I found myself on my feet moving through a puppet show. Where does Timothy Leary belong in this dance of illu- sion? I thought of my kids and walked somehow upstairs to the second-floor landing and opened the door to my daughter's room. Susan was sitting in bed, the classic thirteen-year-old with her hair up in curlers, frowning in concentration at the school book in her lap, while rock-and-roll music blasted through the room. It was pure Saturday Evening Post Cover Americana. The puppet doll teen-ager glanced up. Hi, Dad. She was biting a pencil and looking at the book. I slumped against the wall, looking with amazement at this marionette stranger, from assembly-line America. She glanced up again, quickly. Hi, Dad, what would you like for Christmas? She went on biting the pencil, frowning at the book, waving slightly at the beat of the music. In a minute she looked up again. Hi, Dad, I love you. A shock of terror convulsed me. This was my daughter and this was the father-daughter game. A shallow, superficial, stereotyped, meaningless ex- change of Hi, Dad, Hi, Sue, How are you Dad? How's school? What do you want for Christmas? Have you done your homework? The plastic doll father and the plastic doll daughter both mounted on little wheels, rolling by each other around and around on fixed tracks. A complete vulgarization of the real situation two incredibly complex, trillion- cell clusters, rooted in an eternity of evolution, sharing for a flicker this space-time coordinate. And offered this rare chance to merge souls and bring out the divinity in the other, but desiccated and deadened into the Hi Dad Hi Susan squeaks. I looked at her beseechingly, straining for real contact. I was stunned with guilt. With microscopic clarity, I saw the egocentricity, the sham of my devoted-father routine. Is it too late, can I come back, glorify this rare trembling opportunity? I turned and slowly walked down- stairs to the front hallway. Eleven-year-old Jack sat on the floor watching television.

Jack Benny, wise, noble, long-suffering guru, was going through a routine, about death, the transience of life. Memories from my boyhood Fred Allen, Jack Pearl, Will Rogers, Charlie Chaplin. Each week the cosmic television show repeating the same message, infusing into the frail, karmic forms of Benny, Allen, Rogers, the ancient message, comic and tragic. Don't you see? It's spinning by you, blinding you. Don't you catch on? You're going, you're going. Use the few seconds that remain. I suddenly knew that everything is a message from the impersonal, relentless, infinite, divine in- telligence, weaving a new web of life each second, bombarding us with a message. Don't you see! You're nothing! Wake up! Glorify me! Join me! Then there were three men on the TV screen. One was in a barber's chair, one was facing him, the other had his back turned. The third man suddenly wheeled around and said, looking straight through the television tube, into my eyes, You've been dead for two seconds. The cosmic playwright uses diverse messages to get the point across. It's in a flower, it's in the light of a star which takes millions of years to reach your eyes. Sometimes for the stupid he even writes it out in words in a television drama, for those whose obtuseness can only be opened up by the boob tube. I'd been dead for two seconds. And this is what hell is like. I could look back over the past forty years with chagrin, with pain at my blindness. Every second presented me with a golden chance to tune in, to break through, to glorify, to really groove and dance with God's great song. And every second of every minute of every hour of every day I grimly played out my narrow little mental chess- game. The action was still continuing on the tele- vision set, but my consciousness was shrieking in remorse. Agonbite of inwit! Waste! Waste! Fool! How many times had I heard the message? In all the great religious books, in all the poems, every- place it confronted me. Forget yourself. Tune in on the big picture. Then I heard music. I looked up at the screen Here in New York we are still tolerated, having a number of respectable peo- ple who support our work with the lenience usually displayed towards the crimes committed by mo- torists.

What was she singing? The second time around, I'm so glad I met you, the second time around. It suddenly dawned on me, that's what death is, that's what hell is. It just keeps going, there's no end to it. You have your first chance to touch and taste, tissue, direct contact with God's energy, and then when that's over, a second time, you repeat the whole process, but it's different. There's a plastic film between you and the divine process around you, your egocentricity, your deadening mind has created a plastic hell. That's the meaning of ghosts and anguished spirits, doomed for eternity to exist, separated from life, that precious, fragile gift that we squander every second of this so-called mortal reality.

This time you are one vibration beat behind that ecstatic intersection which the living call life and which the tormented call paradise. Later, I swam into the kitchen. There was a book on the table. I flipped it open. In a second I saw the history of every word on the page tracing back, back, back, back, to the beginnings of written lan- guage. Back down to one sentence, The death of the father, morte du pere, and in that sentence, boiled and bubbled down to the essence of the one word, morte, there it was again, the grim con- frontation. I sat on the kitchen floor, looking at my body, my skin of delicately treated leather, exquisitely carved but dead. I saw plastic veins, blue and pink, and I saw celluloid fingernails. My mind was spinning like a computer that had no connection with any- thing live no flesh, no cell, no sweat, no smell. I had lost my senses, morte. Death. With only the mind to spin out its universe of thoughts. Now you know what hell is. The mind cut off from the body, from life, from seed, from cell. George Litwin staggered into the room.

I was in his mind, he was in my mind, we both saw the whole thing, the illusion, the artifice, the flimsy game-nature of the mental universe. The popeyed look of terror changed to mellow resignation and the Buddha smiled. He murmured the word, Har- vard, smiling. I said, America. He said, Duty. And I said, Love. He flinched and then nodded, smiling sadly, Yes, love. That was the ultimate confronta- tion. The last shattered secret from the Buddha bag. It's all an illusion, even love. And what's left? The wise, cool, all-seeing eyes and the slight smile around the mouth. Acceptance, peace, resigned serenity, it's all in your own mind, Baby, the whole bit from beginning to end. It is the spinning out of your own chessboard. Caesar, Alexander, Christ, America, Timothy Leary, George Litwin, even love they only exist because you think them. Stop thinking them and they do not exist. Then George was gone. I floated to the door. Perhaps outside the house I could find something solid, real, tangible. I ran out to the lawn, snow, trees, starlight. It had never been more beautiful. Etched, sharp, magnified. I stood there listening for the answer. Where is the center? What is real? What can we do? Then rapidly, but completely, in careful detail I recapitulated the social and intellectual history of the human race. I relived and worked through every solution which the human mind had at- tempted. Society, migrations, groupings, tribal wanderings, invasions, the planting of crops, the building of cities, the restless searching for possi- bility and meaning, the moral codes, the taboos and kinships, the emergence of stumbling species groping for answer, for order, for center, the lost mutants trapped in their forebrains, trying to think and act their way back to the center. What to do and where to go? I could foresee the outcome of any action I should begin. And slowly, like a string being reeled back, I retraced my steps to that central spot in front of the fire where the session had begun. Here was the beginning Michael, the As in the Pavilion of the Mind, this is the stuff of conversation. It is this healthy curiosity in the human temperament which will in due course make a triumphant success of this show. In case any doubt still ex- ists that the Mind Pavilion will be perhaps the out- standing success at the New York World's Fair, the fact is that the public is much more interested in re- sults and devices than the- ory, more involved with see- ing and hearing than read- ing, more concerned with being better than with being different.

May- nard and Flo on the couch. Flo draped across Maynard's lap. I said something. Flo sat up and replied. Maynard's head went back and laughed. Then I repeated the same message, Flo sat up, Maynard laughed. I repeated the same message. Flo sat up and Maynard laughed. We were trapped in a time loop. Doomed forever to repeat a brief television commercial, over and over again at the station break. Flo and Maynard were beautiful, stage-dressed, made-up characters. The classic frail beauty, and the dapper young musician, costumed for their parts. I looked at Michael. His sad face bore the record of all human suffering. He was clearly one of the twelve apostles, cast for the moment in the funny little drama of Michael and Cambridge, come to teach us the ancient message that the center is back by the fire with your friends. Quiet detached trust and mutual acceptance of the ultimate cosmological horror. Limited. Limited. Limited.

Waiting patiently through those long periods of plastic isolation, until that next vibrant contact came. George, by this time, had disappeared. His ordeal of death and renewal ran along a similar line, with only the stage props different. At that moment of ultimate confrontation he knew that his place was at home with his wife. He ran to his car and with conscious, accurate reflexes started it and drove down the street. Ahead of him was a Volks- wagen and behind with their lights gleaming were three cars, except that George was really in a troika fleeing across a snowy Russian steppe. In front of him, bouncing along, was a rabbit. And behind him, yellow eyes gleaming with pursuit, were three wolves. Over and over the snow they sped, the rabbit, the troika, and the pursuing wolves, till suddenly the lights flashed red in front of him. Dutifully the rabbit stopped, George reined up his troika, and in ballet rhythm the three wolves, poised on their haunches, waited patiently. Then the light"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Fall 1961 00 253 flashed green, and off they went again, the rabbit, the troika, and the straining wolves. George knew that distance had to be kept or there would be danger for the rabbit or danger from the wolves. When his street loomed up he automatically swung to the right, parked the car, ran to the house, buried his head in his wife's lap for the rest of the evening, which was the beginning of their next voyage. Meanwhile, my cosmic odyssey went on and on. One myth after another, lived out and traced back to the basic flash in the silent, impersonal, whirring of primal vibrations, beyond sense, beyond cell, beyond seed, beyond life. The latticework shuttling of energy patterns. All forms, all structure, man- made and organic, were seen clearly in their molecular and particle nature. All structure was an illusion. Every form was a momentary stage prop for the great theater of illusion, continually changing. My previous psychedelic sessions with psilocybin had opened me up to the sensory levels of con- sciousness, pushed consciousness out to the mem- brane frontier, contact points of eyeball and light, ear canal and sound. Psilocybin had sucked me down into nerve nets, into the somatic organs, heart pulse, and air breath, had let me spiral down the DNA ladder of evolution to the beginning of life on this planet. But LSD was something different. Mi- chael's heaping spoonful had flipped consciousness out beyond life into the whirling dance of pure energy, where nothing existed except whirring vi- brations, and each illusory form was simply a different frequency. It was the most shattering experience of my life. I sat there, a part of Einstein's equation, seeing it all, terrified and confused, desperately looking for some structure which would last against the ruth- less bombardment of energy waves, and through it all, sitting with his head cradled in, his knees, was the architect of enlightenment, the magician, who had flicked the switch to this alchemical show of revelation.

I now saw him as the lost victim of the revelations he'd unleashed. As I studied him care- fully I could see scars on his face and hands and even threads of antennae sticking up from his skull. He shot a piteous, resigned look in my direction. He is the victim of some greater power, his con- sciousness has been captured, perhaps by intelli- gences from another planet. He is not a free agent. He knows what he's doing but he has no control over it. His turning us on is not an act of love and glorification but some sort of compulsion. He has to do it.

I was still higher than I had ever been before, but at least some structure was coming back. The flow of vibrations had stopped, and I felt myself freezing into a mold of plastic. There was a terrible sense of loss, of nostalgia, for the long hours, eons really, when one was at the heart of meaning and the radiant core of the energy process. I walked up to the Fergusons' room. They were sitting transfixed, feeling the same despair at their ejection from paradise. I knelt before Flo with my head in her lap, tears came down her eyes, and I found myself shaking with sobs. Why had we lost it? Why were we being reborn? In these silly leather bodies with these trivial little chessboard minds? For the rest of the morning I was in a daze, stunned by what had happened, trying to figure out what to do with these new revelations, how they make sense, what to do with life routines, which were obviously pointless, senseless, and completely artificial.

They were full of enthusiasm and energy, planning for our next ses- sion. I was very quiet. The few things I said were spoken in a low, serene voice, and carefully selected so they would make sense to an amoeba, to a nuclear particle. My mood carried over to them, I knew. They were quiet, and peaceful when I left. I remember driving back to my office in Cam- bridge from the prison. I could still feel a strange electric noise in my brain and I was still struggling with that question, Why did I return? Why were the gates of paradise closed to me? Where had I lost the flow? Was it fear, or greed, or the result of past stupidities? And would I ever get the chance again to break through to that other illusion, and participate in the heart of the great vibration dance. Then I realized what I was doing. I was imposing the old mental game on the inexplicable mystery story of life. It all had to do with trust and ac- ceptance. When I got to my office they told me later I was noticeably changed. Pearl, the jewel secretary, and the graduate students waiting for me were immedi- ately turned-on by what they called a solid serenity. It was impossible to say much. I listened, smiled. After a few minutes George Litwin walked in. It was the first time I had seen him since our sub- marine death scene in my kitchen. Our eyes met again in deep understanding. I took him by the arm and walked to a nearby conference room and closed the door. Neither one of us said a word for a long time. Well, what do we do now? Right, he said. That's all IVe been thinking about. Once you see how it's all composed, it is hard to go back to the game. Love too. Yes, love too. He stood looking out the window at the twilight. Let's go up to my place, have a drink, and look at the fire. He nodded. For the next few days, everyone on our research project was watching George and me with reverent concern. They could tell we had been beyond where we had ever been before. They were fasci- nated and frightened by what had happened to us. Dick Alpert in particular was concerned.

My relationship with Michael had undergone the greatest change. I treated him with an awed re- spect. There was still a big part of my conscious- ness which saw him as messenger from a divinity. How right and beautiful it was that God should send his messenger in the form of this eccentric, impatient, and mildly disreputable Michael. I got up early to take him to work and studied his every move for clues. Every time I questioned him about the session he reacted with an evasive casualness, shoulder shrugs, raised eyebrows. That's the way it is, you know. With no more detailed explanations. It has been five years since that first LSD trip with Michael Hollingshead. I have never forgotten it. Nor has it been possible for me to return to the life I was leading before that session. I have never recovered from that shattering ontological confron- tation. I have never been able to take myself, my mind, and the social world around me as seriously. Since that time five years ago I have been acutely aware of the fact that everything I perceive, every- thing within and around me is a creation of my own consciousness. From that day in November 1961 until this moment, sitting in the sun at Millbrook, dictating these words, I have never quite lost the realization that I am an actor and that everyone and every- thing around me is stage prop and setting for the comic drama I am creating. LSD can be a pro- foundly asocial experience. Since that first session with Michael I was never able to commit myself to the game of Harvard or even to the game of rehabilitation.

There is a second aspect of this session from which I have never recovered. The mind manipula- tion paranoia. Before this LSD session with Michael, I had taken psilocybin over a hundred times. But in each case I was the one who was directing the session and giving out sacramental drugs. Michael was the first person to guide me and to propel me out beyond my mind. Ever since that day I have had a recurring science-fiction paranoia which comes up in almost every LSD session. It starts like this: suddenly, with a click, I am this new level of reality. I am suddenly on camera in a ancient television show directed and designed by some unknown intelligence. I'm the pathetic clown, the shallow, corny, twentieth-century American, the classic buffoon completely caught in a world of his own making, and not realizing that the goals and ambitions he strives for, the serious games he strug- gles with, are simply the comic relief, a brief clown act.

M. Prison Ley hill Wotton-Under-Edge, Glos. 26 May 1967 My dear Timothy, Today marks my first an- niversary in prison, for it was one year ago exactly that I was sentenced. Of course I have seen many changes in this time, some for best, some for the worse, but all always wel- come. But perhaps the most interesting have been in the catering arrangements, which are always a source of difficulty in a closed community. Most prisons work on a self- service system. Now oddly enough, forward looking Leyhill prison may soon be the only one in the country where inmates are still waited on by servants. Nicholas: I like my experiments simple. Lily de Seitas: the days of simple experiments are over. (The Magus) But who's the sponsor of the show? What am I supposed to do? Who, in all the crowd of stereo- typed puppets that I command around me, is the director of the show? He would, of course, be the last person that I would think of, that Leo of the League, who is to lead me to a higher level of consciousness. Am I the only one who had not caught on, who has not broken through? The only one still thrashing around in egocentric isolation? And who is Michael with his half -bald head and his angelic gross face, pink-veined from alcohol, chain- smoking Camel cigarettes? A self-service system, pre- sided over by a grim, steel- helmeted prison officer in gym shoes, was tried for several years. But it was found that the biggest and toughest inmates invariably got all the food, amid scenes of brutish greed and violence hardly paralleled since Eolithic times. The prison officer was repeat- edly coshed and the con- tents of his pockets shared among the same natural in- mate leaders."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"258 00 The Drop-Out Drug After experiments with the tough system, with even worse results, a solution has now been found.

But is life truly 'hard' in prison? Do prisoners spend all their time scheming and planning to escape? Isn't prison something of an anachronism in our 20th century society? Let's look at some of the facts.

Yes, of course, please make use of my name in your book Hollingshead or Shinkfield-Hollings- head, it is a matter of preference, though with the latter, some sales are assured in the North of Eng- land and in the Lothians. Your account of those early days fulfills perfectly so it seems to me the purpose of bringing out a history of the psychedelic movement. And to those of us fortunate enough to have taken part in this evolutionary process, this is the (almost) only consolation of which the spectrals of the world cannot deprive us. Turning to the manuscript, there were only a couple of matters of fact which need correcting. The first, on page 1, Professor G. E. Moore is associated with Cambridge, not Oxford. He was 84 when he joined the Association for Cultural Ex- change Ltd., which he did as that organization's secretary, a duty he carried out, I must now add, by proxy. The second factual error is in the very last sentence . . . And who is Michael with his half-bald head and his angelic gross face, pink- veined from alcohol, chain-smoking Camel cigar- ettes? For my face really isn't pink- veined and the suggestion that it is, and is so moreover through a hinted over-indulgence in alcohol, does not quite fit the picture I have of myself from that time, though of course I did drink, and still do, but not in vein- reddening proportions.

I think it reads well, though it calls for perhaps a cool, hard look again and a reminder to yourself of the purpose in going into print at this early stage. For considerable finesse and great subtlety in the arrangement of your material is called for, and any attempt to ignore subtlety in favor of speed will so much lessen the real value a reader could derive from your analysis and thoughts. For you must write always as you are, which is a fine, sensible human being, able to recognize in others what is forward-looking, and help foster their creativity; a teacher of depth, most profound of all in modern times; a catalyst and a sustainer of those who followed your Way. Nothing less or it will trivialize your work. For mystery is the philosopher's night and water: like the earth herself, a daughter of truth, and marches about that unforgiving Sun, in wheeled abysses toward un- known light's embraces, until the dreamer ceases to murmur against stars or maker, go roving secret races and only the moon notices, that watcher of selves that shimmers on a pitcher of water, sieving the mystery of all our dark places, in a handful of faces; so many lost embraces in newly found high places. The loneliness of the human soul is unen- durable; nothing can penetrate it except the highest intensity of the sort of love that religious teachers have preached; whatever does not spring from this motive is harmful, or at best useless; it follows that in human relations one should penetrate to the core of loneliness in each person and speak to that. Until I met you I had taken little notice of that fact, but I listened willingly, and felt at home in your com- pany.

The only difference was in duration: whereas LSD and mescaline typically last eight to ten hours, DMT lasted from forty minutes to one hour and DET from two to three hours. The higher homologues, dipropyltryptamine and di- butyltryptamine, were also said to be active but less potent. The parent substance, tryp- tamine, by itself has no ef- fect. Chemically, DMT is closely related to psilocybin and psilocin (4-hydroxy-N-di- methyltryptamine), as well as to bufotenine (5-hydroxy- N-dimethyltryptamine). During the first year of the Harvard Psychedelic Research Project, rumors circulated about a power- ful psychedelic chemical called dimethyltrypta- mine: DMT. The effect of this substance was sup- posed to last for less than an hour and to produce terrorizing effects. It was alleged to be the horror- show drug of the psychedelic family. William Burroughs had tried it in London and radioed back an urgent warning. Burroughs was working at that time on a theory of neurological geography certain cortical areas being heavenly, other areas being diabolical. Like an explorer mov- ing into a new continent, he believed it important to map out the friendly areas of the brain and the hostile. In Burroughs' pharmacological cartography, DMT propelled the voyager into strange and de- cidedly unfriendly territory. Burroughs told a gripping tale about a psychia- trist in London who had taken DMT with a friend. After a few minutes the frightened friend began requesting help. The psychiatrist, himself being spun through a universe of shuttling, vibratory pigments, reached for his hypodermic needle, which had been fragmented into a shimmering assemblage of wave mosaics, and bent over to administer an antidote. Much to his dismay, his friend, twisting in panic, was suddenly transformed into a writhing, wiggling reptile, jewel-encrusted and sparkling. The doctor's dilemma: where to make an intravenous injection in a squirming ori- ental-martian snake?

Dr. Watts gave an awe-full description of perceptual fusion. In the fall of 1962, while giving a three-day series of lectures to the Southern California Society of Clinical Psychologists, Dick Alpert and I fell into discussion with a psychiatrist who was collecting data on DMT. He had given the drug to over a hundred subjects and only four had reported pleas- ant experiences. This was a challenge to the set- setting hypothesis. Can chemicals produce specific changes in con- sciousness? Was the molecular structure of DMT such that it automatically produced hell trips? Is there really a hell area of the nervous system? Or is it not the expectation and surroundings which make the experience hellish or heavenly? A basic theological issue is involved here. It's the ancient question that has divided philosophers for several thousand years. We become involved once again in the bitter debate that rent the academic calm of the Middle Ages. Realism or nominalism. The problem of universals. Do qualities really exist or are they just interpretations that the mind im- poses? Do redness, goodness, sharpness really exist? Does evil exist? Does the devil exist? Does psychosis exist? Is there an area of the brain in which hell is to be found? And one specific molec- ular key to this area? Or do we simply create these categories with our minds? Look through our mind's eye to find them and then proclaim the redundancy to be a fact, and then armed with the schoolmaster's rod teach the names and facts to our children, who then obediently discover and confirm the reality of our names and facts, and then armed with sword strike down or imprison those who doubt the reality of our names or facts? This most basic debate has raged in every culture and philosophy and religion. The hard-reality Brahmins and the soft-flowing Buddhas. The fixed dualists and the easy monists.

Like LSD and psilocybin, DMT has the property of in- creasing the metabolic turn- over of serotonin in the body. An enzyme capable of con- verting naturally occurring tryptamine to DMT has re- cently been found in some mammalian tissue. This suggests that mecha- nisms may exist whereby the body converts normally occurring substances to psychedelic compounds. DMT has been identified as one of the ingredients in the seeds of mimosa hostilis from which the Pancaru In- dians of Pernambuco, Bra- zil, prepare an hallucino- genic beverage they call vinho de Jurumena. 00 From \"An Open Letter to Timothy Leary\" by The Rt. Rev. Michael Francis Itkin: I have recently done a great deal of research and study on this matter, and I find that neither DMT or DET are truly psychedelics, nor for that matter even true hallucinogenic agents in the general usage of those terms."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"266 00 Are Heaven and Hell Real? Rather, both DMT and DET are deliriants, i.e., the ef- fects they achieve are ob- tained by subjecting the body to a state of delirium similar to that which might accompany a fever of 105 degrees. The degree wrought to the physical center is commen- surate with the physical conditions accompanying a 105-degree fever. In addition, I am sure you have observed the tempo- rarily ruptured blood ves- sels in the eyes of those who have used DMT or DET with great frequency. Consider, then, what these same deliriants must do to the blood vessels through- out the intestinal tract, to the tissues of the liver, to the brain cells and, per- haps most clearly possible and defined, to the heart (particularly to the aorta).

The Islamic orthodoxy of Baghdad vs. the intoxicated pantheism of the Sufis. The legal finality of the Sanhedrin vs. Essene fervor. Here it comes again. The old ontological quarrel. Does a psychedelic drug produce any definite reac- tion, or is the experience created by the divine freedom of the experiencer? Are God and the Devil out there or within? Does LSD cause psychosis or multiple-orgasm? Does DMT trigger off a neurolog- ical horror show or new levels of satori? We had found little difference among psyche- delic drugs. As nominalists and ecstatics we were convinced that the elaborate clinical variations allegedly found in reactions to different drugs were psychedelic folktales. We were sticking to our null hypothesis that psychedelic drugs had no specific effect on consciousness, except to expand it, and that expectation, preparation, spiritual climate, and the emotional contract with the drug-giver, ac- counted for specific differences in reaction. Good trips or bad trips. We were eager to see if the fabled terror-drug, DMT, would fit the set-setting theory. A session was arranged. We came to the home of the psychiatrist accompanied by a Vedanta monk and two female friends. After a lengthy and friendly discussion with the physician, Dick Alpert lay down on a couch. His girl friend's head rested on his chest. I sat on the edge of the couch, smiling reassurance. Fifty mgs. of DMT were administered intramuscularly. Within two minutes Dick Alpert's face was glow- ing with serene joy. For the next twenty-three minutes he gasped and murmured in pleasure, keeping up an amused and ecstatic account of his visions. Exactly twenty-five minutes after administration, he smiled, sighed, sat up swinging his legs over the side of the couch and said, It lasted for a million years and for a split second. Now it's your turn. With this reassuring precedent, I took up posi- tion on the couch. Virginia sat on the floor holding my hand.

Immediately after my return the drug was ad- ministered to the Hindu monk. This dedicated man had spent fourteen years in meditation and renun- ciation. He was a sannyasin entitled to wear the sacred saffron robe. He had participated in several psychedelic drug sessions with extremely positive results and was convinced that the biochemical road to samadhi was not only valid but perhaps the most natural method for people living in a techno- logical civilization. His reaction to DMT was, however, confusing and unpleasant. Catapulted into a sudden ego-loss, he struggled to rationalize his experience in terms of classic Hindu techniques. He kept looking up at the group in puzzled helplessness. Suspicion. Re- proach. Defiance. Promptly at twenty-five minutes he sat up, laughed sheepishly, What a paranoid trip! I really got trapped. The lesson was clear. DMT, like the other psy- chedelic keys, could open an infinity of possibilities. Set, setting, suggestibility, temperamental back- ground were always there as filters through which the ecstatic experience could be distorted. Thus also in nature a holy seriousness is to be seen in the fact that natural occurrences are uniformly subject to law. Contemplation of the divine mean- ing underlying the workings of the universe gives to the man who is called upon to influence others the means of producing like effects. ( I Ching XX ) On return to Cambridge, arrangements were made with a drug company and with our medical consultant to run a systematic research on the new substance. During the subsequent months we ran over one hundred sessions at first training exer- cises for experienced researchers and then later trials with subjects completely inexperienced in psychedelic matters. The percentage of successful, ecstatic sessions"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Winter 1961 00 269 ran high over 90 percent. The set-setting hypoth- esis clearly held for DMT in regard to positive experiences. But there were certain definite charac- teristics of the DMT experience which were mark- edly different from the standard psychedelics LSD, psilocybin, mescaline. First of all, the dura- tion. The eight-hour trip was reduced to around thirty minutes. The intensity was greater as well. This is to say, the shattering of learned-form-per- ception, the collapse of the learned structure was much more pronounced. Eyes closed produced a soft, silent, lightning- fast, whirling dance of incredible cellular forms- acre upon acre of softly spinning organic forms. A swirling, tumbling, soft rocket-ride through facto- ries of tissue. The variety and irreality of the precise, exquisite feathery clockwork organic machinery. Many LSD subjects report endless odysseys through the network of circulatory tunnels. But with DMT a sub-cellular cloud-ride into a world of ordered, moving beauty which defies external met- aphor. Eyes open produced a similar collapse of external objects. Faces and things no longer had form but were seen as a shimmering play of vibrations. Per- ception of solid structures was seen to be a function of visual nets, mosaics, cobwebs of light-energy. The transcendence of ego-space- time was most often noticed. Subjects frequently complained that they became so lost in the lovely flow of timeless existences that the experience ended too soon and was so smooth that landmarks were lacking to make memory very detailed. The usual milestones for perception and memory were lacking. There could be no memory of the sequence of visions because there was no time and no memory of structure because space was converted into flowing process. To deal with this problem we began to program sessions. The subject would be asked every two minutes to respond, or he would be presented with an agreed-upon stimulus every two minutes. The landmarks would, in this way, be provided by the experiment. The temporal sequence could be broken up into stages. One of the first programmed space shots with From \"The Experiential Typewriter\" by Timothy Leary, in the Psychedelic Review: The communication prob- lem is like this. Suppose we put a subject in the front seat of a roller coaster and we sit next to him during the dizzy ride. As the car plummets down the first gasping descent we ask him, What do you see and feel? By the time we have said the second word the car has flashed down into the black descent and is screeching around a turn. As the car starts to pull up the next incline he says, What did you say? When we repeat the question he looks at us blankly. Well, it happened too fast. I just can't put into words.

As he rockets down the descent the most he can stutter is, Oooh. Lights . . . and. ... By this time he is around the dark bend and heading up. It's just too fast for words, is about the best you are going to get. Now the ac- tion of the cortex is per- haps a million times faster and more complex than re- actions to a roller coaster ride. And that's why you should never ask a subject during an LSD session what he is experiencing. Now suppose we install a recording gadget on the roller coaster. Let's imagine twenty but- tons which the subject will push to record his reac- tions.

DMT involved a three-person crew myself, Ralph Metzner, and his wise wife Susan. The instrument for radioing messages back was the experiential typewriter. This device is designed to allow non- verbal communication during psychedelic sessions. There are two keyboards with ten buttons for each hand. The twenty keys are connected to a twenty- pen polygraph which registers an ink mark on a flowing roll of paper each time a key is struck. The subject must learn the codes for the range of experience before the session and is trained to respond automatically, indicating the area of his consciousness. In this trip it was agreed that I would be ques- tioned every two minutes, to indicate the content of my awareness. The session took place in a special room, eight-by- twenty, which was completely covered, ceiling, walls, and floor, by warm, colorful Indian prints. The session followed the alternating-guide model. Ralph and Susan were to act as interrogators for my session. Ralph was then to repeat the session with me as ground control. At 8: 10 p.m. I received 6o mgs. of DMT.

The person \"up there\" is being whirled through experiences which spin by so rapidly and contain structural content so different from our familiar macroscopic forms that he cannot possibly describe where he is or what he is experiencing. Consider the analogy to the pilot of a plane who has lost his bearings and who contacts La Guardia tower by radio. The pilot is experiencing many events he can describe the cloud formations, lightning flashes, the etching of ice on the plane window but none of this makes any sense to the tower technicians who are attempting to plot his course in the three-dimensional language of naviga- tion. The person \"up there\" cannot provide the categories. The ground control personnel must radio them \"up.\" Cessna 64 Bravo, our radar scopes show you are fifteen miles southwest of Interna- tional Airport. The red glow you see is the reflec- tion of Manhattan. To head on a course for Boston you must change your course to 57 degrees and maintain an altitude of 5500. But the language of psychology is not sophisti- cated enough to provide such parameters. Nor are there experiential compasses to determine direc- tion. What we can do at this point is to set up \"flight plans.\" The subject can work out, before the ses- sion, the areas of experience he wishes to contact; and he can plan the temporal sequence of his visionary voyage. He will not be able during the flight to tell \"ground control\" where he is, but ground control can contact him and tell him where to proceed. Thus, during this session when Ralph asked where are you now? I could not respond. I had to descend, slow up the flow of experience, and then tell him where I had been or where I ended up. When the contact question came I would be hurtling through other galaxies. In order to re- spond, I had to stop my free rocketing, tumbling flight, return near the earth and say, I am over New Haven.

The Heisenberg principle. Psychedelic research is experimental philosophy, empirical metaphysics, visionary science. Psychedelic drugs offer new perspectives on every aspect of human thinking, human behavior, human searching. There is no issue in psychology, physics, biology, and theology which cannot make use of these microscopes of consciousness. The discovery of LSD is as important to philosophy and psychology and religion as the discovery of the microscope was to biology. Psychedelic drugs allow us to study directly, experientially, empirically the problems which have perplexed philosophers for millennia. Indeed, the psychedelic drugs force you, like it or not, prepared or not, to become a philosopher. You are flung bodily into convulsive, terrorized contact with such ancient problems as: What is real? What is true? What is good? What is beautiful? Since i960 our psychedelic explorations have forced us, agonizingly at times, to deal with these crucial questions. We came to the exhausting conclusion that each person must work out all the answers himself. Each person must be his own Moses, his own Augustine, his own Buddha, his own Aquinas, his own Darwin, his own Einstein. You have to experience their confusion, their groping ignorance; you have to work out their exultant answers. You must do it yourself in the swirling crucible of the out-of-the- mind session after you discover to your terror that the answers you thought you had were canned chessboard symbols. In our DMT experiments we dealt empirically with the issue of universals and names. God-Devil, heaven-hell, good-bad, ugly-beauty. Our answer: nothing exists except undulating energy and flow- ing consciousness upon which the grasping mind imposes categories. The categories have nothing to"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Winter 1961 00 279 do with the energy-flow.

Liberated from his ego, he contemplates the laws of life and so realizes that knowing how to become free of blame is the highest good. ( I Ching ) But the symbols, the names are real too. It is possible and indeed necessary to create symbols for mapping and guiding. The symbols apply only for the space-time dimension we arbitrarily and con- sciously impose. You and I can agree on names for certain game sequences and we can communicate accurately within the game context. We'll call this first base and that New Haven. We can develop maps and guidebooks for different levels of consciousness, knowing that the names are artifacts, that the map is not the territory. The psychedelic experience is indescribable, in- effable, but so is every other experience. We can build a language to get you to Yankee Stadium at 3 p.m. on a summer Sunday afternoon and teach you how to score the game. We can build a language to get you out of your twentieth-century mind and spin you back into eerie LSD landscapes and teach you how to score the game. Neither scorecard comes close to matching the intricate energy ex- changes involved in the trip to the ballpark or the trip to your inner galaxies, but the goal and chal- lenge of being a human being is to visit more and more distant ballparks and to build more accurate scorecards.

At the time I ate the sacred mushrooms of Mexico I called myself as follows: an atheist, a rationalist, skeptical of any sort of authority, ritual, tradition, faith, or magic, an empiricist intolerant of scholas- tic speculation and Talmudic juggling. An arrogant disdainer of fear-directed bourgeois conformity. I was convinced that the choice was to be indepen- dent-effective-right or obedient-routine-good, but not both. Now a number of psycholo- gists and theologians are exploring such hallucino- genic drugs as mescaline, psilocybin and LSD-25 as an easy way to instant mys- ticism. In large enough doses these drugs can simulate the ef- fects of certain forms of psychosis to the point, in some cases, of permanent derangement. In controlled, minute doses the drugs produce weird and wonderful fantasies of sight and feeling; in Greenwich Village and on college campuses, they seem to be replacing mari- juana as the hip way to get kicks. The high-school principal looked at me calmly. You have consistently ignored the principles upon which this school is based. The Kantian Categorical Imperative.

I was the editor of the high-school paper which had just won the interstate prize for excellence, but I cut classes and skipped school. The principal slowly turned a fountain pen in his hand.

That afternoon I packed my gear in a jeep and drove to the railroad station down by the Hudson under the granite fortress cliffs. First class- men who knew and sympathized and some plebes who didn't know but sympathized came up to shake my hand (most of them, by habit, still main- taining the silence), and a colonel attached to the superintendent's office stopped, flagged the jeep down, and came over silently and shook my hand. It took a moment for the Jesuit Dean of Students to understand my refusal of his offer to return to Holy Cross. Then his face flushed with red. I had never seen him angry before.

It was all a Monopoly game easy to win at but meaningless. I had just been promised tenure at Harvard. Five hours after eating the mushrooms it was all changed. The revelation had come. The veil had been pulled back. The classic vision. The fullblown conversion experience. The prophetic call. The works. God had spoken.

The use of the peyote cac- tus, from which mescaline is derived, is a regular part of the communion services of the native American church, composed of 200,- 000 U.S. Indians. Novelist Aldous Huxley wrote in the Doors of Per- ception that mescaline pro- duced in him an effect that seemed like seeing the beatific vision. Psychologist Timothy Leary, who was dropped from Har- vard faculty last spring after receiving strong criticism for his freewheeling re- search in the use of LSD and psilocybin, gave the drugs to sixty-nine full- time religious professionals, found that three out of four had intense mystico-reli- gious reactions, and more than half claimed that they had the deepest spiritual experience of their life."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"284 00 When Will You Be Ready? Such spiritual experiences range from heavenly to hideous: a number of sub- jects suffer through ago- nizing intimations of hell rather than of paradise. words: For this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel: And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams. . . . Most instant mystics feel that they have been reborn, and have suddenly been given the key to existence, although their intuition usu- ally appears in the form of an incommunicable plati- tude, such as, oneness is all. California prison psycholo- gist Wilson Van Dusen, for example, imagined himself in a black void in which \"God was walking on me and I cried for joy. \"My own voice seemed to speak of His coming. But I didn't believe it. Suddenly and unexpectedly the zenith of the void was lit up with the blinding presence of the One. \"How did I know it? All I can say is that there was no possibility of doubt.\" Union with God. This kind of experience seems to be at least subjectively reli- gious; but there are less convincing cases in which drug takers appear to have read religion into their vi- sions or rigged the setting to induce a spiritual ex- perience. It was for me the authentic Moses, Mohammed, Blake, Boehme, Shankara, St. John of the Cross, trip. Now, mind you, I'm not comparing myself to these great eloquent, effective, popular newscasters from the central broadcasting station. Millions of unknown, incoherent, ineffective persons have stumbled on the billion-year-old ticker tape and got the message and have been unable to tune it back to society. But believe this the message is the same, in spite of the transmitter, and I got the message by a swimming pool in Cuernavaca in August i960. Then what? If I had been a believing psychologist, the temp- tation would be to rush back to the tribe and use the revelation in the psychology game get re- search grants, write scientific articles, become famous. A new Freud. So simple and so what. If I had been a painter, I would have started etching out the visions and gained renown and money as a new Salvador Dali. If I had been a businessman, the reflex reaction to the mushroom vision would be commercial. Busi- ness is the religion of America and the best way to have introduced psychedelic sacraments into the culture would have been to market them. I recall the first businessman that we ever turned- on. He was a friend of a psychiatrist who brought him over one Sunday for a session. After a couple of hours he swam up to me with that ecstatic, all- seeing gleam in his eye. Magnificent! I see it all! Incredible! Look, Leary, you've got to get me a million doses of this! I smiled. This was the usual reaction. The physi- cists wanted a million doses to solve the non-exis- tent problem of space-time. The artists, to make the world beautiful. What would you do with a million doses?"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"Spring 1962 00 285 The merchant looked at me with disdain. Why, it's obvious. This is worth a hundred dollars a dose. A million doses is a hundred million bucks! If it weren't for my scholar's prejudice against commerce, we might have added small amounts of psilocybin to ginger-ale and quinine-water bottles and sold it as a new form of cocktail. One bottle would have been the equivalent of a joint of mari- juana. Ten bottles would produce a visionary voy- age. Psilocybin at that time was considered a mild, safe form of mushroom juice, and who would have objected to its sale in health stores? What would be more American than non-alcoholic ecstasy cocktails sold for a profit? The most typical thing to do after your revelation is to announce it to everyone. Rush back and tell everyone. Listen! Wake up! You are God! You have the Divine plan engraved in cellular script within you. Listen! Take this sacrament! You'll see! You'll get the revelation! It will change your life! You'll be reborn! I started doing this the day after my conversion. I rushed over to Tepoztlan to tell the McClellands. Mary McClelland is a Quaker mystic and she listened with interest and sympathy. David Mc- Clelland is a Presbyterian convert to Quakerism. His shock and horror was unmistakable. If I had described the pleasure of heroin or sexual seduction of minors, he couldn't have shown more reflex dismay. I found myself getting poetic and dogmatic. I know it is a real reality! I know it is the Divine message! David McClelland now looked alarmed. Clinical diagnostic glances. Wow! Do I have a nut on my hands here? He was my boss at Harvard. I shut up and made a joke about Celtic enthu- siasm and we talked about department politics. I was faced with the ancient dilemma of the visionary to whom God has spoken. After his illumination the Buddha sat for forty- nine days and nights wondering if he should go back and tune-in the message. He knew the Hindu priesthood would be angry. Mohammed got into all sorts of administrative One professor at Protes- tant divinity school recalls that he was handed a rose to contemplate after taking his dose of LSD. As I looked at the rose it began to glow, he said, and suddenly I felt that I under- stood the rose. A few days later when I reread the biblical account of Moses and the burning bush it suddenly made sense to me. Perhaps the best-known de- liberate effort to create religious experience with drugs was a special ser- vice in the basement chapel beneath Boston University's non-denominational Marsh Chapel on Good Friday last year. Organ music was piped into the dimly lit chapel for a group of twenty subjects, half of whom were given LSD while the rest took placebos. A minister gave a brief ser- mon, and the students were left alone to meditate. Dur- ing the next three hours, all except one of the LSD takers (but only one of those who took placebos) reported a genuine religious experience."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"286 00 When Will You Be Ready? I felt a deep union with God, reports one participant. I remember feeling a pro- found sense of sorrow that there was no priest or min- ister at the altar. I had a tremendous urge to go up on the altar and minister the services. But I had this sense of un- worthiness, and I crawled under the pews and tried to get away. Finally I carried my Bible to the altar and then tried to preach. The only words I mumbled were peace peace. I felt I was communicating be- yond words. Most churchmen are duly skeptical about equating an afternoon on LSD with the intuitions of a St. John of the Cross or a Martin Luther. R. C. Zaehner of Oxford, a Roman Catholic and an ex- pert on Eastern religions, holds that the drug-ingested visions are simply one of many kinds of preternatural experience, and are qualita- tively different from the ec- stasies granted mystics. trouble. After three years only thirteen persons- slaves, no-accounts, and women listened to him. Boehme, Eckhart, and Luther, and George Fox, spoke about it and the wrath of the establishment came down on them. Even Moses had his problems. When are you ready to take the message seri- ously enough to announce it? This is it! Thou art the man! I am He! You are He! Don't be deceived by the bureaucratic church. Dont think you can escape it. The revelation comes to everyman in his lifetime. You can close your eyes and try to ignore it. But it will come to you. Every man is the chosen man. Had you forgotten? But when are you ready to accept it? And how will you announce it? For an American in i960 a.d. there was little vocational preparation for the prophetic role. There was no college-major for prophecy least of all in the divinity schools. The steps to secular success were spelled out in every college catalogue but not for that only important profession the discovery of your divinity. There was no listing in the yellow pages of the phone book for visionary messiah. The entire weight of American education is engi- neered to crush the religious impulse. Other times have been easier. Luther was a brilliant priest in a God-obsessed society. The Buddha had pursued a grueling yoga for several years before his flash. I was unprepared for the message. It would take me six years to accept the call. I was trained as a psychologist. Psychology is a particularly vulgar, profane profession. It took Carl Jung a lifetime to kick the psychology habit and locate his center within. T. G. Fechner, the founder of scientific psychology, lay tormented on a bed, blind, incoherent, for more than a year before he tore off the blindfold and spoke the word. All is consciousness and consciousness is one. I did not wander barefoot forth from Mexico preaching the word. I flew back to Harvard Univer- sity and started a research project. The strategy was to provide religious experiences and then scien- tifically measure the overt benefit.

Just the public good, the behavior change that would result. The dull would become creative. The neurotic would become whole. The criminal would reform his evil ways. Through questionnaire and objective personality tests and statistical analysis we would prove \"scientifically\" that God exists in man and that this power miracles doth perform. Of course everyone intuitively saw through the scheme and resisted it everyone, that is, who didn't turn-on. The self-appointed scientists and the academics were skeptical and irritated. They sensed what I was up to and knew that my cha- risma and enthusiasm could make it work. The psychedelic sages also murmured against the research plan. It was too public, too superficial, too easy. The psychedelic underground. The handful of Americans who knew where it was at most of them long-time students of oriental philosophy and mystic experiences. The first friend to warn me to keep the discovery private was Frank Barron. He was shocked at my organizing a large project of graduate students. This sort of research is internal. Take it yourself and read Blake. Frank had taken the mushrooms two years before and it plunged him into twelve months of contemplation, wild poetry, and dedicated study of mystical philosophy. The politics, the administration, the organization of a large research project made no sense to him. Frank Barron is a gentleman scholar of the old school a cross between William James and Dylan Thomas. Bureaucracy, committee meetings alien- ated his Celtic mystic intuitions. Experimentation on the sacred mushroom and the mystic experience made no more sense to Frank than psychological studies of the effects of the Catholic sacraments.

Clerics also charge that LSD zealots have become a clique of modern gnostics concerned only with fur- thering their private search for what they call inner free- dom. Others feel that the church should not quickly dismiss anything that has the power to deepen faith. Dr. W. T.

In an article on the drugs written with Leary for the journal Religious Education, Dr. Walter Houston Clark of Andover Newton Theologi- cal School argued that the structure of the drugs is similar to that of a family of chemicals in the body known as indoles. It may be, he suggested, that a naturally occurring excess of the indoles might predispose some people to certain kinds of mystical ex- perience. Says Paul Lee, an instructor at M.I.T. who took LSD while a student at Harvard Divinity School: The pity is that our every- day religious experience has become so jaded, so rationalized that to become aware of the mystery, won- derment, and confusion of life we must resort to the drugs. Nonetheless, many of us are profoundly grateful for the vistas opened up by the drug experience. It remains to be seen whether this experience is to be interpreted in reli- gious language. 00 make quantitative measures and statistical analyses of the Holy Spirit. Oh, really? Are you kidding? Listen, Frank, let's come on as psychologists and develop a research project that aims at producing the ecstatic moment. Develop a science of ecstatics. Train graduate students to illuminate themselves and others. We have statisticians who systematize the static how about ecstatisticians who systema- tize the ecstatic? No, you can't do it with graduate students. They are temperamentally and professionally trained to look outside, at behavior. You'll find your native mystics among artists, poets, eccentrics. Don't mix the professional with the spiritual. And don't talk about the mushrooms so much. But it was impossible not to talk about the ex- perience. I was peripherally involved in Cambridge social life. Cocktails. Dinners. Conversations. Sitting on a sofa with a dry martini trying to explain what it is like to go out of your mind and talk to God. Professors' wives leaning forward, wet lips, eyes glistening, the scent of perfume and alcohol breath. Fascination. Disbelief. Fear. Gerald Heard, bearded wise old philosopher, knew what was going to happen. He had studied the sociology of ecstasy for forty years and recog- nized the ancient sacramental meaning of LSD. He came to visit us at Harvard. We asked his advice in the form of specific, practical questions and he always replied in parables. The Eleusinian mysteries. Tantric cults. Tibetan secrets. The Masonic Brotherhood. The Illuminati. Medieval sects. The oral tradition. The secret teachings al- ways passed from guru to disciple. He never gave an explicit answer but the meaning was clear.

A High Church ceremony. Goblets. Homemade bread and good French wine. Parables and Zen jokes. Susan, my twelve-year-old, and Jack, age ten, performed as acolytes. The sun shone through the clouds at noon and Madison Presnell and Lisa, his beautiful flower wife, and their twins arrived from church radiant in Easter clothes. Lisa played the grand piano, and Madison, with his African seed wisdom, played the grand jester and floated up to us on contact-high and spun out psychedelic stories. At the communion supper Alan laughed. I see everything, everything in its cosmic dimension. Every phrase. Every action. How divinely funny. Aldous Huxley sat with us in our early planning sessions and turned-on with us but remained con- vinced that religion was the inevitable institutional channel for the psychedelics. He called LSD a gratuitous grace. At his suggestion I initiated dis- cussions with some Unitarian ministers. They were, as always, cultured, tolerant, open-minded, but hopelessly intellectual. One day in December i960 I received a note from a Professor Huston Smith, philosopher at M.I.T. We lunched at the Faculty Club. It seemed that during a seminar on religious experience at M.I.T., Professor Smith had suggested that West- erners could never hope to attain to the mystic experience. Aldous had passed over a note to Huston Smith with my telephone number. Professor Smith had an ideal background for a psychedelic trip. His parents were missionaries and he spent seventeen years in China. His professional game was comparative religion. He had sought the visionary experience in monasteries in Burma and Japan. He had been waiting and working for a long time for the direct confrontation. And so it was arranged that on New Year's Day, 1961, Huston and his good wife Eleanor would come to my house to turn-on. They arrived late. And Huston was nervous. There was no ritual because I was too inexpe- From \"The Religious Ex- perience, Its Production and Interpretation\" by Timothy Leary, in the Psychedelic Review: We have arranged tran- scendental experiences for over four thousand persons from all walks of life, in- cluding two hundred full- time religious professionals, about half of whom belong to Eastern religions and about half of whom profess the Christian or Jewish faith. In our research files and in certain denominational of- fices there is building up a large and quite remarkable collection of reports which will be published when the political atmosphere be- comes more tolerant. At this point it is conserva- tive to state that over sev- enty-five percent of these subjects report intense mystico-religious reactions, and considerably more than half claim that they have had the deepest spiritual experience of their life. We have five scientific studies by qualified in- vestigators the four natu- ralistic studies of Leary et al., Savage et al., Ditman et al. and Janiger-McGloth- lin, and the triple-blind study in the Harvard dissertation mentioned earlier yielding data which indicate that (1) If the setting is sup- portive but not spiritual, be- tween 40 and 75 percent of psychedelic subjects will report intense and life- changing religious experi- ences; . . ."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"290 00 When Will You Ready? and that, (2) If the set and setting are supportive and spiritual, then around 90 percent of the experiences will be revelatory and mys- tico-religious. It is hard to see how these results can be disregarded by those who are con- cerned with spiritual growth and religious development.

After taking the sacrament Huston lay for six hours in a comatose terror. Then lay for four hours in silent dazed contemplation. I had been busy during tiie day offering irrelevant aid, tea (not drunk), fruit (not eaten), supportive remarks (un- answered ) . As I drove them home in heavy silence I felt the session was a failure half blaming my inexpe- rience, half blaming the subjects for being unpre- pared. The next day Huston phoned with the most enthusiastic, ecstatic, grateful cordiality. The ses- sion was more than he expected. The sacrament had unlocked the door. In the subsequent months Huston ran psilocybin sessions for undergraduate and graduate students at M.I.T. Laboratory exercises for his lectures on the mystic experience. Those were the casual days before the politicians and the dark priesthood of psychiatry had made a scandal out of LSD. After the sessions some of his students roared over to Harvard to dedicate their lives to the psy- chedelic cause, but we had no way of using these unleashed spiritual energies no turn-on, tune-in, drop-out program. We had our hands full with converted Harvard graduate students. I wonder what ever happened to those eager youngsters. During the summer and fall of 1961 more and more interest in psychedelics was developing, par- ticularly among the religious. Dr. Walter Houston Clark, Dean of the Hartford Seminary, was a visiting scholar at Harvard and kept coming around to talk about turning-on. He was a handsome, distinguished graying figure of somewhat awesome respectability. He neither drank nor smoked, and talked about William James.

He had a ministerial degree ( Midwest Lutheran, I believe ) and a medical license and was an advanced gradu- ate student in the Ph.D. program of the Harvard Divinity School. Walter wanted to do a thesis dissertation re- search on the psychedelic experience. Yes sir. A medically supervised, double-blind, pre- and post- tested, controlled, scientifically up-to-date kosher experiment on the production of the objectively defined, bona-fide mystic experience as described by Christian visionaries and to be brought about by our ministrations. Walter Pahnke was so serious and so naive, I laughed out loud. How many subjects, Walter? Well, twenty in the control group and twenty in the experiment. And they'll all take the drug in a church with organ music and a sermon and the whole Protestant ritual going. I've read all you've written about the importance of set-and-setting and it sounds right to me. Walter Pahnke spoke with a boy-scovt sincerity. I gulped. You mean you are suggesting we turn- on twenty people at the same time in the same public place. Yes-sirree. Wouldn't be scientific to do it at dif- ferent times. Besides I want to do it on Good Friday in the Boston University Chapel. I know Dean Howard Thurmond and he's interested in the mystic experience and hell let us use the chapel. I really had to laugh at this caricature of the experimental design applied to that most sacred experience. If he had proposed giving aphrodisiacs to twenty virgins to produce a mass orgasm, it wouldn't have sounded further out. My dear Walter, I'm speechless! That is the most reckless wild suggestion I've ever heard in my life. You don't understand what you are dealing with. A psychedelic experience flips you out of your mind. It's intimate. It's private. You laugh. You moan in cosmic terror. You roll on the floor wrestling with God and the devil. In particular, the first session must be in a protected, quiet, secure surrounding. Walter Pahnke was stubborn. It'll be secure, all right.

What are these seven basic spiritual questions? There is the ultimate-power ques- tion, the life question, the human-destiny question, and the ego question. 1.

The emotional question. What should we feel? 7. The ultimate-escape question. How can we end it? Now one important fact about these questions is that they are continually being answered and re- answered, not only by all the religions of the world but also by the data of the natural sciences. Reread these questions from the standpoint of the goals of (1) astronomy- physics, (2) biochemistry, (3) genetics and physi- ology, (4) neurology, (5) psychology, (6) psychia- try, (7) anesthesiology.

No, Walter, you don't get the point. What you are proposing may be psychiatrically safe but it's indecent. You've never had a session, have you? Nope. Well, Walter, I like your idea. I'd love to help you do a systematic study of the mystic experience, but you must know what is involved. You must have several sessions yourself before you begin to think about a research study. Nope. He couldn't do that. He realized that there might be all sorts of opposition to his study from Harvard, from the Divinity School, from the medi- cal people. Gosh, he knew how hidebound people were. Therefore he must preserve his psychedelic virginity. He didn't want to be accused of being biased and too positive. He had to be able to say that he had never taken the drug until after his thesis was accepted. The more time I spent with the indefatigable Walter Pahnke, the more impressed I became. Behind his comball facade there was an inner dedication, an unruffled optimism, a deep belief in the religious experience and the power of psyche- delics to produce it. An informal religious seminar slowly emerged. We began meeting on Sunday nights at Huston Smith's house: Walter Clark and Walter Pahnke and dignified professors from the Divinity School and visiting preachers and divines and a group of graduate students from the Divinity School. I would preach and answer questions. Huston and Walter Clark and Walter Pahnke would com- ment and encourage. Gradually an experiment de- veloped. We would run a session for several divin- ity students. This was a trial run for Walter Pahnke a preparation for his big experiment. The session was scheduled for a Saturday morn- ing in March, 1962. We met in two groups, one at my house and one at Huston's house. We had built up a staff of session guides Harvard graduate students and young professors. It went well. Walter Clark finally had his mystic experience, which he described in a moving report."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"294 00 When Will You Be Ready? Religion is the systematic attempt to provide answers to the same questions sub- jectively, in terms of direct, incontrovertible private ex- perience. At this point I should like to present my central thesis. I am going to advance the hypothesis that those as- pects of the psychedelic experience which subjects report to be ineffable and ecstatically religious involve a direct . . . awareness of the processes which physicists and bio- chemists and neurologists measure. (1 ) The ultimate-power ques- tion. A. The scientific an- swers to this question change constantly New- tonian laws, quantum inde- terminacy, atomic structure, nuclear structure. Today the basic energy is located within the nucleus. Inside the atom, a trans- parent sphere of emptiness thinly populated with elec- trons, the substance of the atom has shrunk to a core of unbelievable smallness: Enlarged one thousand mil- lion times, an atom would be about the size of a foot- ball, but its nucleus would still be hardly visible a mere speck of dust at the center. The psychedelic experience posed problems for some of the divinity students. Each one of these voyagers had a vision as dramatic as Moses or Mohammed. One college chaplain found himself in a bottomless well of cell and tissue and realized he was dying (i.e. mortal), and looked up for the light but doubted, and reached for faith and prayer and couldn't find it, and despaired and fell back on his mind for explanations and control, and grew sulky and de- manding and could not believe. He explained the experience afterwards in psychiatric terms and soon after left the ministry for a career in the social sciences. It was strong Old Testament stuff, believe me. Another minister found himself dying and cried out in great fear, and we told him, Pray, brother, and he prayed and was reborn in radiance. And another rolled on the floor, discovering that sex was the red-flame of life, copulating the carpet, and cried out, Is God nothing but sex? and we reminded him of his prayer \"Thy will be done, Lord, not my will but thine,\" and he prayed and wept for joy. And another minister walked tensely into the garden and when I approached him smiling, he said, If you mention the word guilt to me 111 punch you in the nose. And he cried out in despair, Who can help me? I said, Pray to your God, and he said, The hell with God, I want my wife, and I said, Your wife is God, and he said, Right! My wife is God! Get me home. Toward the end of the session we got a driver to take him one hundred miles back to his wife, and he had two telepathic experiences that left him awed and reverent and very much in love with his wife. And the minister who fell on his knees, ordered us all to do likewise, and looked up at me with righteous tears and said, Timothy Leary, put aside your vanity and testify to the Blood of the Lamb, and his minister friend, also high, said, Yes. Amen. Look at his eyes, the eyes of Christ, and I looked down at the wells of suffering and groaned that laughing Jesus had been made martyr by these Christians. And the friend said, Ho. Ho.

By God, I was tackled by suffering Jesus-eyes burning me with reproach. And the two Christians on their knees looked up at me relentless, and linebacker Jesus-eyes would not let me go. I was amused and irritated because I saw the two thousand years of Christian moral-one-upman- ship and missionary coercion and holy sado-maso- chism.

Psychedelic reports of- ten contain phrases which seem to describe similar phenomena, subjectively ex- perienced. Subjects speak of partici- pating and merging with pure (i.e., content-free) en- ergy, white light: of witness- ing the breakdown of mac- roscopic objects into vibra- tory patterns, the awareness that everything is a dance of particles, sensing the smallness and fragility of our system, vi- sions of the void, of world- ending explosions, of the cyclical nature of creation and dissolution, etc. It was during these sessions that I first caught on to the power and meaning of prayer. That prayer wasn't a telegram sent in the English language to the department of requisition and supply on the top floor. I realized that you' have to be out of your mind to pray. That you can't rationalize with a five- billion-year-old energy process. That only psychot- ics and flipped-out saints and psychedelics can pray. And that prayer is the compass . . . the gy- roscope . . . the centering device to give you di- rection and courage and trust at those moments when you are overwhelmed by the power and breadth of the divine process. The psychedelic experience posed problems for some of the divinity students. It seemed that most of them were more interested in their doctorates, and academic careers. The problem was that in these careers the revelatory confrontation and the voice of God had not played much of a part. So there were crises of conscience and identity but it was all healthy and yeasty and the religious seminar continued Sunday evenings and we kept turning-on ministers and divinity students by day and by night. Meanwhile I had been through my big LSD death-rebirth under the guidance of Michael, and the religious-ontological nature of the psychedelic experience was obvious to me, and any secular discussion about psychedelic drugs creativity, psychiatric treatment, etc. seemed irrelevant. I was catching the religious fever. An increasing number of priests and ministers and theologians kept coming around. And then in the spring of 1962 came the swing to the East. It started with Fred Swain, World War II air force major, who became a Vedanta Hindu monk in 1948, and who lived in an ashram near Boston. He started hanging out at the house and he told us about Hinduism and the psychedelic pantheon of gods and his guru and yoga. Fred had gone to Mexico the year before and had a far-out mush- room trip with Maria Sabrina in the mountains of Oaxaca. I started visiting the Vedanta ashram. It was a surprise and delight to discover this group of holy, mature, sensible people who had renounced the"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"Spring 1962 00 297 world in pursuit of the visionary quest. The Hindu Bibles read like psychedelic manuals. The Hindu myths were session reports. The ashram itself was a turn-on. A serene, rhythmic life of work and medi- tation all aimed at getting high. The reports of Fred Swain and Alan Watts and Aldous Huxley had impressed them with the yogic possibilities of psychedelic drugs. They were watch- ing me too, testing me out. After several visits I was asked, shyly, to guide a session for some of the people in the ashram. I came to the ashram early one morning and joined the meditating-chanting service. Then, those who were to take the trip remained for more prayers and contemplation. The LSD had been placed in chalices on the altar. Incense and flowers adorned it. The LSD sacrament was mixed with holy water from the Ganges, blessed, and drunk. Now I need not apologize for the flimsy inadequacy of these words. We just don't have a better experiential vocabulary. If God were to permit you a brief voyage into the divine process, let you whirl for a second into the atomic nu- cleus or spin you out on a light-year trip through the galaxies, . . . how on earth would you de- scribe what you saw, when you got back, breathless, to your office? In human affairs, aesthetic form comes into being when traditions exist that, strong and abiding like mountains, are made pleasing by a lucid beauty. By contemplating the forms existing in the heavens we come to understand time and its changing demands. Through contemplation of the forms existing in human society it becomes possible to shape the world. (IChing XXII) This metaphor may sound far-fetched and irrelevant to you, but just ask someone who has taken LSD in a supportive setting. Then we moved from the altar to the larger shrine-room we sat Indian-style on an oriental rug. Candles. Incense. Chanting. Then the Holy folk got high. I could see the LSD take over. In spite of their years of preparation they were shocked by the power and complexity of the LSD. They knew exactly what was happening but it still scared them. I was high too and overcome by the power of the ashram and the shrine and the ancient rituals. We were all caught in Hindu my- thologies. I was awed and dazzled and confused. What happens here? Now I'm Siva, okay, but what do I do? Hindu sessions have been going on for five thousand years. I'm a naive Westerner. I remem- bered my prayer, When in doubt, be quiet, drift, trust. I sat erect in the Indian position flipped-out, ecstatic, bewildered. The Holy people of the ashram were bowled (2) The Life question: A.

The others watched with hushed attention. Fred Swain crouched, squatting, the monkey-God, Hanuman. We were four figures from a temple carving. We were four timeless divinities caught in the classic posture of union, celebration, cosmic tension. I leaned down and smiled and stroked Sakti's brow. Rest, beloved. We are one. She sighed, Oh yes, and the others nodded. The candles burned silently. The incense smoke rose, essence of Holy India, reek of Kalighat temple, Calcutta, holy scent of Ram Mandir Ben- ares and Jaganath Puri and Konarak. I looked around the room. Ramakrishna's statue breathed and his eyes twinkled the message. Vivekananda's brown face beamed and winked. Christ grinned to be joined again with his celestial brothers. The rare- wood walls breathed. The sacred kundalini serpent uncoiled up the bronzed candelabra to the thou- sand-petaled lotus blossom. This was the fulcrum moment of eternity.

That's why so many gurus get stale and pompous and narcissistic. They believe and react to the fantasies about their holiness. That was the power of Gandhi, of Ramakrishna, of Gurdjieff. They knew that the guru has to keep turning-on/tuning- in/ dropping-out. And that's the dilemma of Krish- namurti. He saw the falseness of his avatar-God role. It had been laid on him, after all, without his choice as a child, and he was too intelligent and too honest to go along with it and he shouted, Stop. Come on! I'm not The God. You all are Gods, if you only remember. But Krishnamurti had no way of Terrestrial life began around four billion years A.B.

He was doggedly going ahead with plans for his controlled experiment. I had gone along with Walter all along, humoring him, knowing that it couldn't happen. But Walter Pahnke was unstoppable. A master politician in the art of the feasible. First he cooled me out. He agreed to change his design. There would be no turning-on of a large group, no marching around of masses of people stoned out of their minds. Walter agreed to divide the sample into five small groups. In each group there would be four divinity students two of whom would be given psilocybin ( the sacred mushroom in pill form) and the other two a placebo (a non- psychedelic pill). Each group would be guided by two members of our Harvard project psychedelic veterans one of whom would take psilocybin and one of whom would get the placebo. No one, not even Walter Pahnke, would know who would get the sacrament and who would draw the inactive pill. Walter balked at the guides taking the drug. This was the main objection which psychiatrists and self- appointed researchers were leveling at our work. How can doctors take drugs with the subjects? The psychiatrists and scientists who were denouncing our work had never taken a psychedelic. To them LSD and psilocybin made you drunk like booze or crazy like mental hospitals.

Next, Walter went to the administrators at the three schools and reassured them. The implausible breadth and scope of the experiment was itself an advantage. The fact that three colleges were in- volved allowed for administrative buck-passing. After all, reasoned Boston University, it's a Harvard doctoral dissertation. After all, reasoned Harvard, our students are not involved as subjects. After all, reasoned Andover-Newton, it's really a Harvard- Boston University project. Our students are in- volved as individuals. And then Walter had some powerful sacred cows going for him. He was an M.D., a minister, a Har- vard scientist. But more important were the good human energies he had going for him. First there was his own unmistakable sincerity and his reassur- ing, square, conventional, earnest solidity. Then he had the backlog of solid spiritual power that had been a-building up over the past year. Every theologian, minister, and administrator in the Boston area had felt the ripple of our religious project. We had provided (in safety) deep, shatter- ing, spiritual conversion experiences for a good two dozen members of the academic establishment. The good word had got around. Then, and perhaps most important, Walter had the full support of at least one impressive, high- status person at each institution. Professor Huston Smith of M.I.T. saintly, benevolent, articulate, sound, mature would be a guide and take the pill blindly on Good Friday and risk going out of his mind. And Dr. Walter Clark of Andover-Newton con- vincing, mellow, lovable was ready to take the sacrament with strangers and lend his guiding wisdom. And at Harvard, Walter Pahnke's thesis-adviser was behind the experiment. So during the Lenten weeks we divided into groups, and the two guides met with the four students and got to know each other and shared I have seen the lines of architects, the very finest, like a spider's thread; but those are still different, they are not the images of those lines which the eye of flesh showed me: He knoweth them, whosoever without any conception whatsoever of a body, recognises them within himself. 00 From The Age of Belief by Anne Fremantle: Augustine concludes that past and future are all measured, as is the present too, by memory; indeed all reality, including God him- self, lurks there, in man's memory. 00 From The Confessions of St. Augustine: When I enter there, I re- quire what I will to be brought forth, and some- thing instantly comes; oth- ers must be longer sought after, which are fetched, as it were, out of some inner receptacle; others rush out in troops, and while one thing is desired and re- quired, they start forth, as who should say, \"Is it per- chance I?\" These things do I within, in that vast court of my mem- ory.

You see, the groups had this great thing in common. The sharing of goal and risk. No one knew who would receive the sacrament. We were all in it together. So, much to my amazement, the project came down to the final week with high enthusiasm and competent preparations. The little band of worship- ers drew close together, and the administrators in the Roman centers of pharisaic power remained nervously silent. By God, and by miracle, it was ap- parently going to happen. And then on Wednesday of Holy Week the Sanhedrin-ax fell. Walter Pahnke's motorcycle roared into my driveway that evening, and Walter stood in the kitchen in his leather jacket, stripping off his gloves, his face worried, telling me the bad news. We couldn't get the sacrament. We had agreed some time back to allay bureaucratic fears by turning over our supply of psychedelic drugs to Dr. Dana Farnsworth, director of the Harvard Med- ical Service. Farnsworth was now refusing to re- lease them for the Good Friday study. Dana Farnsworth was a genial extroverted politi- cal doctor whose administrative career was un- complicated by wit, wisdom, ethical principle, or scientific curiosity. Step one was to find out who was behind Farns- worth. I phoned the chairman of the academic committee who was overseeing our research project. He was at home, and his voice and the background noise spelled cocktail party. Fred, I've just found out that Farnsworth won't give us the drugs for the Good Friday study. The professor's voice lost the booze lilt and be- came guarded. Yes, so I hear. Well, Fred, he can't do that. The agreement was that your committee would approve the studies and that Farnsworth would release the drugs when we needed them. They belong to us, not him, after all. . . .

No, there couldn't possibly be a meeting until next week. Until after Good Friday. Well, let's be specific, Fred. Farnsworth wouldn't refuse to release the drugs without checking with the watchdog committee. And he would release them if you approved it. Right? Right. And will you tell them to release the drugs for the Good Friday experiment on the religious ex- perience? No. We won't interfere one way or the other, Tim. It's not our problem. We can't say yes. We don't want to get blamed if the experiment blows up in a scandal. Drugs on Good Friday, really, old man! And we don't want to say no, either. We can't stop research. So you are washing your hands of the affair. Exactly. We are washing our hands of the matter. And if we never hear of it again it will be great with me. Beautiful, Fred. Those classic lines have never been better delivered. But don't be under any illusions. You are going to hear more about the affair. I hung up the phone and looked at Walter Pahnke. He had been listening anxiously. For the first time his clean-cut Midwestern face was gloomy. This whole thing is so right. I've done everything according to Hoyle medically, scien- tifically, academically, spiritually. We just can't let them stop it. Well, if it's right, Walter, they can't stop it. You can do it if you really want to. This froze Walter in his tracks. Do it anyway? Defy the director of the Health Department? Defy the Harvard officials? Walter didn't have a rebellious bone in his body. He was an establishment man, a good boy, right down the line. The problem was, he was one of those hardheaded, grass-roots, orthodox idealists who really believed in what was right. And stub- born about his virtue. Your classic, old-fashioned Protestant type.

I thought you had given all the sacrament to Farns worth. I did give him all I had, but there's a psychiatrist in Worcester to whom I gave a supply last month and I know he hasn't used them and he'll give them back. All perfectly legal.

Then he clapped his hands together and stuck out his chin and spoke with dogged determination. It's right and it should be done. But it's got to be done openly.

The next day the telephone kept ringing every few minutes. Walter's voice kept growing with confidence. Everyone agreed. On Holy Thursday evening, only eighteen hours before the Sacred Three-Hour Vigil, we got the pills and had them ground down to powder and sorted into plain envelopes with code numbers to set up the double blind experiment. Then at midnight on the eve of Good Friday I called the chairman of my department at Harvard. Look, David, I just want to tell you, in front, that we have the sacrament and we are going ahead with the religious experiment. David groaned. Oh God, why did you have to tell me in advance?

Yet, though without many of the indications of mystical experience, I know I will understand the mystics much better, having had the experience. Even some of the moving expressions of the Bible and religion pale in my at- tempt to describe the ex- perience. Because now I may have to make an administra- tion decision. I laughed. It was too classic! Poor Pilate! David, that's the way it always is. Good Friday always poses problems for administrators. We assembled at the Seminary at ten the next morning. The guides would drive the students to the ceremony. Five rooms in the basement of the Boston University chapel were reserved for the groups. My group of six sat around waiting. The students had Bibles. Pahnke walked in with the envelopes each coded. In each envelope was a capsule containing white powder. I asked one of the students to say a prayer and we remained in silence for a while and then we took the pill. Then we all sat waiting to discover what we had taken. The students were reading their Bibles, but I guessed they weren't concentrating on the words. After a while I felt something changing inside. Ah. Good! I got the psilocybin. I waited. My skin became pink and flushed with heat. Hello. That's odd. Never felt like this from psilocybin. Soon my body was radiating heat but my consciousness was unchanged. Then I realized what had happened. Pahnke had given us a placebo with a somatic kick to fool us. I found out later it was nicotinic acid. I looked up and saw that two students had flushed faces. They were squirming with pleased expressions. One of them winked at the other. He rose and said he was going to the toilet. The other red-faced student joined him. As guide, I trailed along. Inside the John they were exulting like happy conspirators. We must have got the mushroom. Yeah, I can feel it. We're the lucky ones. I smiled and kidded them about playing the placebo game. While we stood there the door banged open. A third student from our group walked in. He looked neither left nor right. No greetings. His eyes were glowing and he was smiling. He walked to the window and stood for a long time looking out. Jesus, he cried, God is everywhere. Oh the Glory of it! Then he walked out without a word. No social games with him.

After thirty minutes everyone knows what has happened, who has taken the sacrament. Just before noon Pahnke came through and had us all go to the small chapel. Thirty of us sat in the dim candlelight. Dean Howard Thurmond came in, robed and vested. He spoke a few words. Quietly, serenely. He blessed us and left. Then through the speakers we could hear him begin his three-hour service in the main chapel above. Prayers. Organ music. Hymns. It was easy to tell who had taken the psychedel- ics. Ten students sat attentively like good wor- shipers. Facing the altar. Silent. The others were less conventional. Some lay on the benches one lay on the floor. Some wandered around the chapel murmuring in prayer and wonderment. One chanted a hymn. One wandered to the altar and held his hands aloft. One sat at the organ bench and played weird, exciting chords. One wanted to go out. The doors to the basement were locked and a doorkeeper was on guard. I told Pahnke I'd accompany his restless mystic. We walked along the avenue. Cars whizzed by. I felt fear and moved to the street side of my charge. I had a fantasy he might run out in the avenue. He, of course, read my mind. You are so brutally aware of where things are at during a session. Telepathy? He glanced at me, as if to say, Is that the game? So he tried to edge by me to walk on the curb. I got more scared. He made a feint to run into the street. My paranoia had forced him into the role of pris- oner, seeking to escape. Then I caught on and laughed. Let's not play that silly game, I said. He nodded. We walked around the chapel. He was out of his mind. Con- fused. Struggling for meaning. What is it all about? Who is running the show? What am I supposed to do? We walked back to the basement. My student was still frightened. I kept too close to him. My concern alarmed him. He ran to the piano and banged down the lid savagely. He ran to the wall and grabbed a picture, holding it above his head ready to smash it if he were approached. Some would include: de- scent into hell and resur- rection, death and transfig- uration, the moment of truth, naked on the shores of eternity, etc. I seemed to live a lifetime of pain and tragedy as I saw myself stripped bare, and at the time seemingly little to fall back on to sat- isfy my swollen ego.

We had proved once again that goodwill, and good motives, and trust and courage are the basic research tools. It was a great spiritual test for all of us and we would never forget that Good Friday afternoon of death, fear, ecstasy and rebirth. In the next few weeks the results of the Good Friday session kept feeding back. Pahnke had teams of interviewers (who knew nothing about the study) collecting the stories of the twenty students, rating the comments and kinds of religious experience. The results were clear-cut and consistent. The men who ate the mushrooms had mystic religious experiences. The control group didn't.

The trustees of the Divinity School moved to silence Dr. Walter Clark. But they couldn't. This gentle, thoughtful man consulted his conscience and refused to keep silent. But follow-up studies at the Seminary were stopped, and the divine enthusi- asm of the divinity students was blocked and dis- sipated. Walter Pahnke got his thesis uneasily approved, and his degree was awarded. Walter went to Ger- many on a fellowship and arranged to have his first conversation with God in a mental hospital in the Rhineland.

There are few Americans over the age of twenty- five who are not totally committed to a dogmatic religious way of life and belief. To admit evidence (however scientific) which threatens the theologi- cal structure is intolerable. Morally unbearable. Philosophically impossible, because when the superstitious religious structure is threatened, life becomes meaningless. General Motors defends its God. Harvard defends its God. Scientists defend their God. So the hostile reaction to Pahnke's experiment and to our prison research and to our psychedelic studies were easily understood. We were nothing less than heretics. Tread warily, O prophet, when you move onto primitive religious ground. Then Gilgamesh sat down and wept, the tears ran down his face, and he took the hand of Urshanabi; O Urshanabi, was it for this that I toiled with my hands, is it for this I have wrung out my heart's blood? For myself I have gained noth- ing; not I, but the beast of the earth has joy of it now. In this case retreat is the right course, and it is through retreat that success is achieved. But suc- cess consists in being able to carry out the retreat correctly. Retreat is not to be confused with flight. Flight means saving oneself under any circum- stances, whereas retreat is a sign of strength. We must be careful not to miss the right moment while we are in full possession of power and position. Then we shall be able to interpret the signs of the time before it is too late and to prepare for provi- sional retreat instead of being drawn into a des- perate life-and-death struggle. ( I Ching IV ) Already the stream has car- ried it twenty leagues back to the channels where I found it. I found a sign and now I have lost it. Let us leave the boat on the bank and go. The miracle of Marsh Chapel was not just a scien- tific study; it was authentic spiritual ceremony. And like every valid Good Friday experiment our spring solstice death-rebirth-celebration (because it worked) invited excommunication and persecu- tion. We were involved, not in a controversial re- search project, but in a classic religious struggle. The arena for this struggle is always within. The stakes of the game were no longer academic pres- tige or scientific renown but the souls of the pro- tagonists. The psychedelic drugs are sacraments, and like all sacraments that work, they demand your all. This too was the work of Gilgamesh, the king, who knew the countries of the world.

The mana- ger of the hotel was a dignified, slender, soft- spoken Swiss gentleman. There was no business during the summer. It was very possible that the owner would close the hotel to the public during July and August and rent it to us as a summer retreat. Suddenly no one is there at the turnstile Letters and funds passed through the mails, and in June I left for Mexico to set up the hotel for the summer.

They had been turned-on by one of our Harvard missionaries and were both ecstatically converted to the wonders of psilocybin. I invited them to join us in Zihuatenejo. They, in turn, invited me to come to their country home in Tepoztlan to run a session for them.

( I Ching II ) And so, once again, the guru was to become disciple, the leader was to be led. I was overdue for a powerful trip. All that spring I had been guiding pilgrims, going up with them but never all the way for me, always lagging back a little to be there for the customers. Being influenced by their visions. Sharing their confusions but always keeping my mind focused and responsible. I was shaken up by the struggles of our spring- time religious revival. I was disturbed by the heavy Christian structure, perplexed by the holding back. The inhibiting, social strength of the Christian Church and its power to bind. Religion.

That spring had been exciting and dramatic and deeply moving to participate in the sacred mo- ments of so many ministers. But there was a nag- ging residual of disappointment in those good, honest, liberal, generous Protestants. They had lost the fire somehow. They had lost the pulse. Their thing was dying and they knew it. The Protestants just weren't religious. Their great thing was their social instinct, their sense of equal- ity.

There was the strong need for some sort of channel for the religious energies we were releas- ing. And it was obvious that the Christian structure was too rigid and fixed. The Christian model just couldn't take the charge. To turn-on an American Christian to the two-billion-year divine process was like harnessing a million-watt electric generator to a crystal set. The flimsy, modern, mythless, rootless American Christian Church just blew its fuse and disconnected the impulse. And the fuse was the familiar rationalization business. A week after the session they'd still be glowing and God-like, but after a month they were sinking back into their routines. Forgetting their antiquity and divine mis- sions.

This is the essence of energy and its combination. Molecules. Cells. They are not smooth- surfaced, rectangular, or carbon-ringed units which fit together like bricks. Each molecule is a heavenly octopus with a million floating jeweled tentacles hungry to merge. Driven by internal pressure, sexual in nature, towards union. Molecular bonding is the webbed merging of these multi-foliated tender flower machines. The hunger is to merge. To share and to grow. But the terrible price of union is to lose identity. Be trapped by the union. The soul of each human being is a soft, floating octopus seed center, exfoliating searching tendrils. Blunt, gross contact bruises. Grabbing hands shatter. Crude jolting contact causes these delicate waving soul tentacles to withdraw, encapsulate like some alarmed crustacean. In his spontaneous, natural state the human be- ing is a radiant sun-star-cell receiving and emitting, feeding and being fed by harmonious neighbors. In the absence of radiant, ex-foliating neighbors each energy center ( atomic, molecular, cellular, human ) withdraws, spins a hard, leathery resistive seed pod and waits until the warm moist radiance returns. I felt my filaments infiltrating the tangled web of Pat's and Parsons' essence bodies. I subdued the selfish, one-celled-fish reflex to withdraw into separ- rate safety. I surrendered to the ancient process and felt the embracing union. I opened my eyes. Pat and Parsons were sitting motionless, eyes closed. As my eyes searched their haloed faces their eyes opened and we looked at each other. And nodded. The session reel continued to whirl through long buried terrains. Toward dawn Pat and Parsons withdrew to their bed chamber. I sat alone and watched the aureal machinery of the room. The air was filled with curving color webs. It seemed the height of vulgarity to plod straight ahead through the room like a blind robot giant treading down forests and cities. I could reach up with my hands and sculpt the energy patterns. One could only move in smooth looping great arcs to keep in harmony with the vibrations."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"June 1962 00 333 (There are at least two explanations of the phe- nomenon of seeing patterns in the air. The most audacious theory is that the energy is really there and that the psychedelic eye can see what the mind's blind eye cannot see. The more conservative viewpoint would locate the patterns in the capillary or cell-structure networks of the retina; that the vision is simply the eye seeing itself. The eye seeing the non-transparent flaws in its own transparent film. In any case this suggests a natural explanation for the strange movements of some mental patients. Their stereotyped motions. Their peculiar attention to invisibles. The expanded consciousness of the so- called psychotic is not hallucinatory, but tuned in to external or internal processes which are there. ) The sun had risen wh a I walked outside. The house was surrounded by growing creatures. The house was a stone raft floating in a sea of vegetation. It was Eden. Each plant was dancing, laughing, a quiet network of high inter tsity conversation. Trembling. Trembling. Immediate. I followed the garden up slope. Japanese statues. Wise Buddh?.- eyes silently watched. The garden ended on a paved walk surrounding a swimming pool. Across the back wall a rocky pasture led up to the cliffs. On the top of the perpendicular cliff wall was the house of the god Tepozteco. Cloud-mists floated along the pasture. I was above the earth. It was the beginning of time. Eden. Above and beyond the life down there. All connections were severed. In fact there was the possibility that the neurological imprints called Mexico City and America no longer even existed I peered across the wall along the rocky pasture to look for human beings. No one. There was no visible evidence that the twentieth century existed. I listened. No sounds of machinery. Bird cries. The rustle of the breeze across the garden. The crowing of cocks. The Timothy Leary game now existed only as a memory. I was liberated. Free to do anything I chose. Stay in the garden. Stay in Tepoztlan. Go back down and wander through the planet as anyone I chose to be. Pick a role. Select a costume. If so, you will be helped by making explicit the religious nature of your psychedelic activities. To give meaning to your own script, to clarify your relationships with others, and to cope with the present legal setup, you will do well to start your own religion. First decide with whom you will make the voyage of dis- covery. If you have a fam- ily, certainly you will in- clude them. If you have close friends, you will cer- tainly want to include them. The question with whom do I league for spiritual dis- covery is a fascinating ex- ercise. Next, sit down with your spiritual companions and put on a page the plan for your trip. You will learn a lot about yourself and your com- panions. You will see where you are and where you are not."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"334 00 Why Come Down? In defining the goal of your religion, you need not use conventional religious lan- guage. You don't have to make your spiritual journey sound religious. Religion cannot be pompous and high-flown. Religion is con- sciousness-expansion, cen- tered in the body and de- fined exactly the way it sounds best to you. Don't be intimidated by Caesar's Hollywood fake versions of religiosity. If life has a meaning for you beyond the TV-studio game, you are religious! Spell it out! Develop your own rituals and costumes. Robes or gray-flannel suits, amulets or tattoos. You will eventu- ally find yourself engaged in a series of sacred moments which feel right to you. Step by step, all your actions will take on a sacramental meaning. Inevitably you will create a ritual sequence for each sense organ and for each of the basic energy exchanges eating, bath- ing, mating, etc. Reality and the addiction to any one reality is a tissue-thin neurological fragility. At the height of a visionary experience it is crystal-clear that you can change completely. Be an entirely different person. Be any person you choose. It is a moment of rebirth. You are neurologically a naked baby. Of course you must be careful in choosing your new role. How much game-training is involved? You cannot decide at once to play center field for the New York Yankees or to teach Greek at Harvard. You cannot move into a role position in a modern twentieth-century power game. You cannot decide to move into a status-position or to take over a part with high material rewards. But it is exactly this sort of position that interests you the least as you look down, not-yet-born Olympian God on the turmoil and conflict of human life. If you were God playfully considering incarnation as a human being, would you choose to appear as Lyndon Baines Johnson? Or the premier of some European country? If ( and when ) you were God, you chose to be re- born in the simplest, least gamey, non-power, low- status position. And you usually did it barefoot. Didn't you? It is habit, fear, and laziness that keep people from changing after an LSD experience. It's so much easier to doubt your divinity, drift back to speaking English, wearing ties, playing the old game. My choice in the garden in Tepoztlan at sunrise was frighteningly open. Should I go back to the twentieth century? You doubt the reality of this option? Listen. There are millions of Americans in mental hospitals right now who have made this choice. Out of confusion or frustration or disbelief in the system. Psychosis is an ontological state, and the psychotic is the person who just won't buy the culture, won't play the game. And if I chose to leave this Eden and return, what terrestrial game shall I play? Which television- prop studio shall I enter? Which part to assume? I wandered back down the gardens, into the house. The living room was empty. It glowed, breathed. Glory. Beauty. A multi-branched candelabrum was burning."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"June 1962 00 335 Compelling. Calling. I knelt in front of it and watched. The wax had dripped down over the wooden branches and into melted carvings. A vine of smoke drifted up from an incense stick. The room was silent except for the whisper of the candles. Then God spoke to me. Not in the English lan- guage. Not in words. He spoke in an older dialect. He spoke through flame and scented smoke. (But He was not the flame and smoke. ) I saw in a quick glimpse the design of the universe. The blueprint of evolution. The imper- sonal, staggering grandeur of the game. Think of the auto designers in a Detroit auto plant. They architect a car but this living struc- ture of God's design is a trillion times more com- plex than a car. God's automobile is called the atom. Each atom is a structure of detailed intricacy held together by energy of such speed and power that it eludes our conception. Each atom is a space- ship of galactic proportions and at the center of each galactic structure God places the entire staff of his atomic engineers. Do you understand the bril- liance of the design? Suppose that General Motors could miniaturize all their designers and engineers and technicians so that they were packaged into every car that rolled off the assembly line. Continu- ously present to insure efficient operation of the automobile. Continuously conducting on-the-spot performance tests. Continuously collecting data on efficiency, comfort, and safety. That's the way the atom is constructed with the intelligence and control and energy-source all in one package inside the nucleus. And that's the way the cell is constructed. Every cell is an electro-chemical-social system more com- plicated than the city of New York with two billion years of accurate intelligence-energy-mem- ory built into the nucleus. God is an expert on miniaturization. The smaller the unit, the more central, the older, the wiser, the more complex, and the more powerful and faster. Individuals of every species are stamped out like plastic toys billions at a time. Immediate turn- over. Planned obsolescense. Spin them out. Kill them off. You must be explicit about the space-time arrangement for your God-game. Each room in your home will con- tain a shrine. Your house will not be a TV actor's dressing room but rather a spiritual center. Regular rhythms of worship will emerge; daily meditation (turn-on) sessions (with or without marijuana), and once a week or once a month you will devote a whole day to turning-on. Time your worship to the rhythm of the seasons, to the planetary calendars. You select a myth as a re- minder that you are part of an ancient and holy pro- cess. You select a myth to guide you when you drop- out of the narrow confines of the fake-prop studio set. Your mythic guide must be one who has solved the death-rebirth riddle. A TV drama hero cannot help you. Caesar, Napoleon, Kennedy are no help to your cellular orientation. Christ, Lao Tse, Hermes, Trismegistus, Socrates, are recurrent turn-on figures. 00"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"336 00 Why Come Down?

Each is a teeming field of decomposition on which new layers of brief transient organisms spin out their moment of convulsive dance. Sedimentary cement cemetery. From the standpoint of the isolated individual, life is a science-fiction horror story. The nervous system mercifully narrows down consciousness so that the individual focuses only on the immediate stimulus. The individual is shackled to a series of reactions to the pressure of food-survival-defense and is spared the overview, the insight that while he pursues his dinner he is hurtling towards his own decomposition. There comes a point in every lifetime when the blinders are removed and the individual glimpses for a second the nature of the process. This revela- tion comes through a biochemical change in the body. A twist of the protein key and you see where you are at in the total process. In any case, there is noth- ing for you to do in a col- lective political sense. Turn-on, Tune-in, Drop-out. Just as there is only one heaven, so too there is only one earth. In the hexagram of heaven the doubling of the trigram implies duration in time, but in the hexagram of earth the doubling connotes the solid- ity and extension in space by virtue of which the earth is able to carry and preserve all things that live and move upon it. The earth in its devotion carries all things, good and evil, without exception. In the same way the superior man gives to his character breadth, purity, and sustaining power, so that he is able both to support and to bear with people and things.

Arjuna saw the Supreme Deity possessing many mouths and eyes, present- ing many a wonderful sight decked with many divine or- naments, wielding many up- lifted divine weapons, wear- ing divine garlands and clothes, besmeared all over with divine sandal pastes, full of all wonders, infinite and having faces on all sides. internally unfolding process. Any point from which one sees the one-ness is a center. That one point of vision is the eye of God, seeing, glorifying, under- standing the whole. One such moment of revelation is the only pur- pose of life. One such moment of vision is the end point of the five-billion-year process of evolution on this planet. One such moment makes the remaining decades of life meaningful and worthwhile. The red-yellow eyes of the candles and the direct- sweet scent of incense told me this in the sunrise living room at Tepoztlan. I became initiated into an ancient company of illumined seers. I understood the Buddha. I was in complete communication with Blake. I was closer to St. Augustine, Johannes Scotus Erigena, Jacob Boehme, than I shall ever be to any person in rational intercourse. There exists inside the human nervous system, inside our cellular structures a tissued, biochemical memory-bank. The person who stumbles onto this inner room sees and knows exactly what has been seen and known by visionaries in the past. Don't talk to me about the objectivity of scientific data or replication of observation. Five thousand years of visionary experience has produced a body of descriptive text of such precision and unanimity that even the distortions of multiple translation and deliberate academic corruption cannot conceal it. Kneeling in front of the candles, trembling in reverence, I saw and heard and sensed and became a member of an invisible religious fraternity. I vowed to dedicate the rest of my life to the preser- vation of this flame. From that moment on I would no longer be an American, a Harvard instructor, a twentieth centurian. I was a visitor to this modern artificial stage set. A wanderer among the card- board fake-prop studio backdrops. A carrier of the ancient message. An itinerant announcer sent from central broadcasting. Waiting for the appropriate moment to interject the commercial we interrupt this program for a brief message. You are all Divine wake up!

I turned from the candles and walked to the windows. The sun was at a low six-in-the-morning angle, just clearing the trees. I stared eastward, eyes open. When I closed my eyes two orange hot disks were burning up the purple-black webbing of my retina. The two glowing orbs changed to yellow and then merged into one and sank into the tissue of my body. After a while Pat and Parsons came out with dazed looks. Wow! What happened? Where are we? Were in Heaven. Isn't that obvious? They nodded. What do we do now? Anything we want. The choice was razor clean. It depended on our consciousness and on our persis- tence. We had the Garden of Eden going. It was consensual. We agreed on that. Our situation was a social reality as real as the illusion that Mexico City existed, or Camel cigarettes. We could stay there and continue paradise. Stay high. Keep the thing going. Invite others to come join us. A new thing. A new cycle. It would be so easy to do. As people arrived at the isolated villa, just treat them as though they had died to all that down there and were reborn here. The three of us could do it just so long as our commitment did not falter. Just so long as we did not slip back into planetary games. Just so long as we insisted on treating each arrived friend as if he were a newly commissioned god. Turn him on. Every social structure is an artifact. An \"as-if\" conspiracy. A \"let's-pretend\" game. Let's pretend we're Americans. Let's pretend green paper is money. Any social game can continue only if all partici- pants share in the ontological conspiracy. If people won't pretend to accept our reality we kill them ( American Indians ) or imprison them ( mental pa- tients) or write them off as a nutty sect, cult, or minority.

A shared consciousness. Politics, religion, economics, social structures, are based on shared states of consciousness. The cause of social conflict is usually neurological. The cure is biochemical. The three of us in the villa at Tepoztlan were in that rare position of being able to create a new reality. We had the two factors going a neurologi- cal liberation. Our game-chessboard had been tem- porarily swept clean. And we were in an isolated social situation, the villa, where we could external- ize our state of consciousness.

Don't plant your tender new ontology in the center of Times Square or St. Peter's Square. To start a new reality is, of course, to start a new religion. Well, should we do it? Should we commit our- selves to our three-fold divinity, to the revelation we had received? A knock on the door. There was our first test. Our first encounter with another consciousness. Three of us stood up and glanced at each other. Vase Usted. Come in. A girl's voice in Spanish Sefior! Senor! Lord! Lord! Open the door. It was an Indian girl, teen-age. Agitated. Tearful. She scuttled into the room wringing her hands. Rapid high-pitched frantic Spanish. The family is poor and they have no money. We looked at each other questioningly. It was a biblical scene. The beggar and the three prophets. Ask her what she wants. Money for food. It was so simple and yet so elusive. The Indian girl was trapped in a karma-game which kept her hungry in a continent of plenty.

Fear, confusion. The emo- tional pressure was intense. We were staring at her with complete attention. We were completely there for her. Radiating love and acceptance. Maria fell to her knees and began to sob. It was too much. Lords, I am a poor girl. My children are sick. My parents are sick. Money for food. Money for food. I knelt down beside her. Pat and Parsons knelt down too. Pure New Testament. The four of us on our knees. I began to pray in English. Let this girl, Maria, receive the vision. Let her escape from her karma. Let her find her divinity and join us in creating a paradise on this spot. Let her receive the revelation. The four of us remained kneeling. I could feel the sweat dripping down from my armpits. There was a long silence. It seemed so simple. We were so close. Just one shift in the vibratory frequency and it could click into focus. It seemed tragic that Maria should have wandered in ( or been sent? ) at exactly this minute and should not make it. It seemed like a tragic defeat if she just brushed by the glory and returned to her village. Maria's discomfort became more visible. She began to whimper. I must go back. Help me, Lords. Parsons looked at me. I shrugged. He pulled twenty pesos from his pocket. Maria's eyes widened. She reached out a tentative brown hand. She took the money and kissed Parsons' hand and ran out the door. We were silent for a long time. Here was a visitor to paradise. And all she wanted was money. Later that afternoon a friend of Parsons' came to visit. He was a social psychologist from Baltimore. Intellectual. Effeminate. He wanted to make small talk but Pat opened right up. She began to describe Lord, seeing your Form reaching the heavens, ef- fulgent, many-coloured, hav- ing its mouth wide open and possessing large shin- ing eyes, I, with my inner self frightened, have lost self-control and find no peace.

Completely with her. The psychologist sat on the edge of the sofa clutching his glass of rum and Coke. His smile weakened. His face fell apart. Disbelief. Disap- proval. Then fear. Alarm. Then a robot dart of recognition. YouVe been taking drugs, haven't you? Pat turned toward him. The flesh of the gods, beloved friend. And you can share our glory if you want to. The psychologist jumped. Alarm. He put the glass down on the coffee table and pushed it away from him. He made a show of glancing at his watch and jumped to his feet. Well, I must toddle off. Just stopped in to say hello. Glad you're having a good time. He walked quickly to the door. He had just been exposed to the eloquent wit- ness, to the passionate, precise testimony and he ran away. The psychologist had brought into the house a nervous, chattering piece of metallic mental ma- chinery. Shrieking gears, noisy, jarring. After he left we could see the spinning wheel of the afternoon weave back golden ribbons through the tears in the delicate fabric. We resumed our divine dance, effortlessly, tune- lessly, in tune with the pulse of the house. We talked, off and on, about the decision. We could phone family and friends back on earth, Hello down there. This is Heaven calling. Parsons went to the phone. To our surprise it worked. Do you think a call will go through? A telephone line from heaven to earth. From heaven to hell. He began placing a call to the operator. It's ringing. Hello, Dad. Listen, I've died. Oh, don't be upset. I'm in Heaven. It's magnificent.

Well, let's put it this way, Dad, Pat and I are happy and we love you and we miss you and we had this impulse to call you and invite you to join us. All right, Dad. We'll write. Good-bye. The good-bye hung in the air, circling the room like a black buzzard. I opened the window and it flew out. By nightfall the discussion took a more practical turn. Parsons began talking about business engage- ments in Mexico City. Tomorrow morning at nine. Pat and I were in favor of staying, but our union with Parsons was so strong that there was no question of a difference of opinion. We nodded and began to pack. It was an eerie scene. Packing bags to leave paradise and return to earth. To the hell of people's striving minds. None of us was sure that anything recognizable existed beyond the villa. Perhaps the twentieth century was a figment of our imagina- tions. Well, let's find out. We'll stick together and love anything we discover. We got in the car and the motor started. We bumped down the tunnel of trees back into the village square. Well, that stage set is still there. We turned onto the super-highway which led over the mountains to Mexico City. Parsons was tired, so I drove. It started to rain. We were still high. Everything was seen under the species of eternity. Parsons pointed to a car pulling a boat. Noah's Ark. Pat, the earth goddess, grew cold in the night. We covered her with blankets. The autostrada is double-laned with white picket fences running along the middle and the outside. The voyage which usually takes ninety minutes was endless. Hour after hour we rolled along. I still felt it was a mistake, a betrayal of the command- ment, to leave Tepoztlan. The restlessness increased as the hours passed. Then, a road sign. Return Gate at 500 meters. Well, that's the message. I swung the car in a U-turn and headed back. Parsons looked up in surprise. Where are you going? I pulled the"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"June 1962 00 345 car over to the side of the road. This highway is endless. The sign said return. I guess we are sup- posed to go back to the villa at Tepoztlan. Parsons began to talk about his appointments in Mexico City. I reversed and cut back through the gate and we continued up the highway. Several hours passed. There was no sound except the hum of the car motor and the jittery flicking of the windshield wipers. Down below I could see the lights of Mexico City, but the road kept circling, never descending, never getting closer. We were trapped. Our consciousness created this highway. High way, indeed. Caught in a space-time loop. We'll spend lifetimes circling the city. The car kept passing landmarks we had passed before. The same hairpin turn over and over again. We would remain frozen in this time-shelf until an act of consciousness broke the cycle. How? What to do? It was a science-fiction horror. We were caught in a relentless orbit doomed to satellite the city in great circles. Perhaps we'll run out of gas. No. I looked at the gauge. It had not changed for hours. Some dramatic shift of direction was necessary to break us out of the orbit. I looked over at Pat and Parsons for their help. They slept. It was up to me. The only escape was to swerve the car off the road. What was a highway anyway, but a fixed habit of consciousness? We can't fly because our consciousness can't soar up to the possibility of flight. Our heavy mental certainty holds us down. The only way to fly is to be convinced of the certainty of flight. The only way to escape the tyranny of the endless highway was to smash through the rational-artifactual assumption that we had to stay on the road. But rapid escape-velocity was required. The car must be accelerated to top speed and then (with- out my mind deciding), when the orbit-road curved, the car would hurtle forward and break out of the trap, catapult splintering through the white guardrail. It was so simple.

Once the flimsy white fence (itself a state of mind) was transcended we would spin free, glide over the valley of Mexico (as Richard and Jack Leary and I did two years before) and look down at the volcano-pitted earth surface, or perhaps we would shoot out into some new level of conscious- ness, some meta-planetary psycho-physical state of gravity-free, bird-like, atom-flash, time-less, electric- orgasm, telepathic simultaneity. Or perhaps, more prosaically, the car would tumble down the cliff. Metal twisting, glass shattering, fatal-accident colli- sion, skin-severing, bone-crushing, blood-soaked, terror-hemorrhaged. But was it not just a test? The bogey-monster fear of protecting your sacred baby skin. The challenge to your egocentric terror of death. How can you reach higher levels of spiritu- ality without giving up your fleshly envelope? How can you reach God unless you sacrifice your ridicu- lous infantile attachment to that hair-covered mucus-filled body? Oh no, I was beyond these gross concerns of physical comfort and physical safety. If the liberation from the heavy weight of the body meant a bloody, fracturing, rending of the body, I was willing. Thy will be done. The car rolled along the endless circular track faster and faster. Pat and Parsons slept. I waited for the straightaway. My thoughts buzzed around the car like busy bees. . . . Relentless orbit. . . . Doomed to satellite. . . . Break out of the orbit. . . . Fixed habit of consciousness. . . . Rapid es- cape velocity required. . . . Car must be accel- erated to top speed . . . without my mind decid- ing. ... What was that? Hold on. Without my mind deciding. Then who would give the signal to press the accelerator? Was it not my mind spinning out its theories of liberation and breakthrough? Was it not my mind cunningly inventing escape routes? Was it not my mind refusing to trust the process?"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"June 1962 00 347 If we were in orbit, then let us stay in orbit. Patiently spinning cold lunar voyagers. Docile. Waiting for the next cycle to be introduced. Faith in the process. Thy will be done. My foot eased off on the gas pedal. The highway suddenly began dropping down. The white fence was gone and the valley floor of Mexico flattened out the road. I looked back at the sleeping passengers. Parsons stirred and opened his eyes. Where are we? Back down on the valley floor. I don't know yet what planet or what country. Oh there's a neon sign. We must be in Mexico. It's in Spanish. A sign! The first sign. What does it say? Servicio total. Total service. That's why we came back. If, reader, I had greater space for writing, I now would sing, in part, of that sweet draught which never could have satiated me; but inasmuch as I have filled the leaves allotted to this canticle, the curb of art now lets me go no farther. From that most holy water, I returned made new as trees are brought to life again with their new foliage purified, and made fit for mounting to the stars. 00 the receptive brings about sublime success, Furthering through the perseverance of a mare. If the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead, He goes astray; But if he follows, he finds guidance. It is favorable to find friends in the west and south, To forgo friends in the east and north. Quiet perseverance brings good fortune.
