Now science knows this to be a benign tumor of child- hood that usually goes away on its own. When Todd McCormick was two, unfortunately, medi- cal science treated Histiocytosis X as a malignant cancer requiring aggressive treatment. This in- cluded chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery—all of which were inflicted on young Todd nine times between the ages of two and ten.

For over a decade the medical profession, through a mistake—an honest mistake, a govern- ment-approved mistake, but a mistake nonethe- less—made Todd unnecessarily and permanently disabled. In addition, the treatment more than likely has shortened his life.

And, adding insult to injury, the government tells us it is doing this to “protect the children.” Where was the government when Todd was two and in need of some protection?

If I lived, I told myself, I would not rest until medical marijuana was available to every sick person in America who needed it. I lived, but I’m a long way from my goal. But back to late 1996. What a treasure trove of information is Todd McCormick! Self-medicating with Todd is a uni- versity education in Cannabis sativa. Not only was he clearly an expert grower, he was also working on determining which strains of marijuana worked best for individual medical conditions. Todd explained that medical marijuana is one of the most advanced and versatile plants in the entire Plant Kingdom. Marijuana has a male plant and a female plant—very rare in botany. Most plants have both sexes in the same plant. Because there are two sexes, medical mari- juana can be bred, the offspring taking on the char- acteristics of both mama and papa. In more than 5,000 years of human medical use, this breeding has led to an almost uncountable (more than 30,000, at least) variations in the medical mari- juana plant. Todd’s goal was and is to identify which strains (variations) best treat which illnesses. For example, some medical marijuana is known for deep bodily relaxation. These strains are good for people with muscle spasms, chronic bodily tension, and pain. Other medical marijuana, however, produces the purely mental responses of alertness, clarity, and creativity. These strains might be best for nausea, depression, and pain."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"H OW TO G ROW M EDICAL M ARIJUANA 24 www.growmedicine.com This is the magazine Todd edited, and yet the federal government refuses to acknowledge him as a writer.

Medical marijuana has the unique ability to filter out pain—either emotional or physical—but allow pleasure and the sense of touch to come through. This was scientifically confirmed in Oc- tober 1997 by a report from the Society for Neu- roscience. (Please see the Medical Marijuana Magazine Online, www.marijuanamagazine.com for more details on this report and other medical uses of marijuana.) Todd had edited a magazine called HempLife in Holland. He had hoped to start a United States edition, but I persuaded him to write a book first. I gave Todd an advance and he used it to rent the ugliest house in Bel Air, dubbed by the press Medical Marijuana Mansion, but known to Todd’s friends as Liberty Castle. It was built to resemble a castle; a castle made of stucco. Nuveau mediae- val, I called it. It had as much charm as Janet Reno. There, awash with Reno Rococo, Todd set up his research facility. He gathered dozens of strains of marijuana. The house became an ad hoc university of medical marijuana—cultivation be- ing but one of many subjects discussed.

Todd credits marijuana with his life, so he is highly sympathetic to those in medical need. Todd's mother started giving him medical marijuana for the nausea of chemotherapy and ra- diation when Todd was nine. Todd feels he never would have survived that bout with chemo- therapy—his eighth—without medical marijuana. Kids on his ward were dying of malnutrition and dehydration brought on by nausea, yet Todd re- tained a healthy appetite and—as importantly, he thinks—a healthy attitude. His mother couldn’t tell the other mothers in the ’ cancer ward—if word got out she was giving a nine-year-old marijuana they would have taken Todd from her, as well as her other two children, one of whom has Down’s syndrome. On July 29, 1997—after an exhaustive five- day investigation and using a California search warrant obtained by intentionally concealing from a judge that Todd was an outspoken medical mari- juana patient and, therefore, legal under Proposi- tion 215—the federal Drug Enforcement Admin- istration (DEA) and the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Narcotics Bureau raided Todd’s home. Fifty agents, armed and in flack jackets, stormed the house as though they were capturing San Juan Hill—or, more accurately, the compound in Waco, Texas.

Completely ignoring Todd’s plea to just seize the plants but not destroy them, DEA & company hacked to death genetic strains that may not exist anywhere else in the world. Todd had one plant that had been continuously alive since 1976. Gone, all gone. Todd was then charged with “manufacturing a controlled substance” and faces life in federal prison—mandatory-minimum ten-year sentence— and a $4 million fine. “They want to put my son in jail for gardening!” Todd’s mother said on hear- ing the news. Bail was set at an outrageous $500,000. (Mur- der suspects are released on $50,000 bonds all the time). Todd’s friend, Woody Harrelson, rode to the rescue just like a movie hero and put up the money to bail Todd out. Way to go, Woody. A year later, Todd has not gone to trial. The government, it seems, is not happy with a simple “manufacturing” count. The Federal Grand Jury refused to indite Todd on “distribution” or even “possession with intent to distribute.” Rebuffed (something the government is not accustomed to before Federal Grand Juries, who have been re- ferred to by many legal experts as “rubber stamps”), the government has spent the past year looking for a juicier “conspiracy” count.

(B) To ensure that patients and their primary caregivers who obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes upon the recommendation of a physician are not subject to criminal prosecution or sanction. (C) To encourage the federal and state governments to implement a plan to provide for the safe and affordable distribution of marijuana to all patients in medical need of marijuana. (2) Nothing in this act shall be construed to supersede legislation prohibiting persons from engaging in conduct that endangers others, nor to condone the diversion of marijuana for nonmedical purposes. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no physician in this state shall be punished, or denied any right or privilege, for having recommended marijuana to a patient for medical purposes. (d) Section 11357, relating to the possession of marijuana, and Sec- tion 11358, relating to the cultivation of marijuana, shall not apply to a patient, or to a patient’s primary caregiver, who possesses or culti- vates marijuana for the personal medical purposes of the patient upon the written or oral recommendation or approval of a physician. (e) For the purposes of this section, “primary caregiver” means the individual designated by the person exempted under this act who has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing, health, or safety of that person. Sec. 2. If any provision of this measure or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the measure which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this measure are severable. 33 I NTRODUCTION : W HO I S T ODD M C C ORMICK ? www.growmedicine.com nameless, for now—continues to operate with the full knowledge of both the federal government and the California Attorney General, Dan Lungren. (Lungren, who also appointed himself state Drug Czar, has not stopped going after medical mari- juana growers and distributors considerably smaller than this informant’s.) People ask, looking back on the endless at- tacks on California medical marijuana patients that have occurred since Todd’s arrest, “Why did any of you do what you did? Were you all crazy?” The answer is, yes, we were (and continue to be) crazy but, no, we were not insane. There were several practical reasons in March 1997, when Todd set up his research facility, to think medical marijuana patients growing their own medicine in California was perfectly legal. First, there was Proposition 215, now the California Compassionate Use Act of 1996, passed by an overwhelming majority in November 1996. More Californians voted for Proposition 215 than voted for Bill Clinton in the same election. The Proposition permitted medical marijuana patients and their caregivers to “cultivate” medical mari- juana. Second, it was the duty of California’s Attor- ney General, Dan Lungren, to challenge Proposi- tion 215 in court if he felt it legally improper. Lun- gren did not do this. Indeed, California’s Attor- ney General said it was all right to break federal law and grow “1 to 2 plants”.

The...um... old ‘second bottle syndrome.’ What was I saying?” 35 I NTRODUCTION : W HO I S T ODD M C C ORMICK ? www.growmedicine.com can you possibly grow “1 to 2 plants”?) Besides, even if AG Lungren didn’t like medical marijuana, the Constitution of California said “It shall be the duty of the Attorney General to see that the laws of the State are uniformly and adequately en- forced.” That, and other admonitions of the Cali- fornia Constitution, we thought, would keep the AG in line. That is, we were foolish enough to believe Dan Lungren would follow the Constitu- tion of the State of California. Third, our national Drug Czar, General Barry McCaffrey, had pulled back from his initial as- sault on California’s medical marijuana users af- ter a federal court in San Francisco told him in early 1997 to leave physicians alone. McCaffrey, having taken a beating in both the court and the press over medical marijuana, commissioned in February 1997 a $1 million study from the Na- tional Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine (NAS/IOM) and distanced himself completely from, as he called it, “the medical marijuana is- sue.” When asked a question about medical mari- juana, he would turn it aside with, “It is in the hands of science, and scientists will decide.” (We’ll see what he has to say in December 1998 when the NAS/IOM report is published.) Fourth, the press discussed the medical use, sale, and cultivation of marijuana as a common- place event. The New York Times Magazine fea- tured a cover story on how well law enforcement and medical marijuana suppliers were getting along—cooperating, even—to honor the will of"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"H OW TO G ROW M EDICAL M ARIJUANA 36 www.growmedicine.com Hemp harvest, from an old photograph.

The press portrayed an easy truce, growing into trust, between patients, caregivers, and law enforcement. Although arrests for marijuana con- tinued unabated (one every 48 seconds in the United States), arrests for medical marijuana in California were, it seemed, a thing of the past. Since Todd’s July 1997 arrest, of course, New York Times headlines are more likely to read, Four California Mayors Ask Clinton to Stop Marijuana Club Suit, (March 22, 1998) about the civil—not criminal—lawsuits filed by the federal government against six California compassion clubs; or this headline from May 26, 1998, Defiant Marijuana Club Closed in Sheriff's Raid, about California At- torney General Lungren’s Holy Crusade to per- sonally destroying the San Francisco Buyer’s Club. (He succeeded, over the strong objections of San Francisco’s chief health officer, District Attorney, and Mayor.) Finally, there had not been a single medical marijuana arrest in California—on the federal or state level—for eight months following the No- vember 1996 passage of Proposition 215. Todd’s arrest in July 1997 was the first federal medical marijuana arrest since 215. I was emboldened to put in a garden myself. I felt like Florence Nightingale and George Wash- ington Carver combined. I had 300 plants.

It could have been a bea- con of healing, comfort, and learning. Instead, a year later, it stands empty. The owner can neither sell it nor lease it. No one, it seems, has a use for the place but Todd. Todd's life is his work, his work being the education about and propagation of an herb he personally knows to ease suffering and save lives. Todd is a good person on an important mis- sion. Todd has a compassionate heart. He also has a body broken by government incompetence—the same government that wants to put him in prison for treating the pain that the government inflicted on him in the first place; the same government that has prevented him from using his medicine of choice for a year now, and so he suffers daily.

I am certain Ms. Maines is a fine musician and composer, and to name her band Dixie Chicks shows that she’s just as gritty as heck, but Ms. Maines, unfortunately, is a perfect example of what the DARE program produces—young people with “facts” about drugs that are entirely wrong. Dr. Pinsky’s character you will discover for yourself. In the beginning, you’ll see, he keeps returning to the fact that Histiocytosis X is not a cancer, therefore Todd is not really a cancer pa- tient. Dr. Pensky keeps pressing this point as though he were revealing “the goods” about Todd. Todd, as you shall see, handles himself very well during this medical Inquisition. In fact, Todd’s passion, clarity, and wisdom got him invited to be on Dr. Pinsky’s radio show, where for two hours Todd was treated by Dr. Pinsky with considerable respect—some might say admiration. Todd’s ability to work such medical miracles is why Todd is so hated by the government. Todd tells the truth about medical marijuana; the government tells only lies.

On May 16, 1966, Bob Dylan released “Rainy Day Women #12 and #35” which included the now-famous refrain: “But I would not feel so all alone, everybody must get stoned.” The old folks thought it was a song about repression (“They'll stone ya when you're tryin' to go home. Then they'll stone ya when you're there all alone.”), but us youngsters knew get- ting stoned meant smoking pot. On May 26, 1966, the Beatles ran to Abbey Road studios and recorded their answer to Dylan and their homage to marijuana. When “Yellow Submarine” was released in August 1966, ev- eryone under 30 knew precisely what the fab four were singing about; everyone over 30 didn’t have a clue— but they thought the song had a nice beat and wasn’t too “noisy.” When the Sea of Green technique was de- veloped in the 1980s, a line from “Yellow Submarine” was used to name it.

If you’re ready to grow, you have two choices. One is to start from clones, the other is to start from seeds. Starting out with clones (also called cuttings) puts you several months ahead of the game. Some people sell clones ($5-to-$50 each), while others distribute clones for free. Once a mother plant gets going, she produces lots of offspring, often more than the owner can flower. These owners some- times spread the extra clones around, Johnny Appleseed style, to medical mari- juana patients in need. If you can obtain one or two clones, these can become your mothers. If you can obtain a larger number of clones, you can start flowering most of them and turn a few into mothers. In this way you don’t have to worry about males (all will be females, as a clone from a female plant is, of course, always a female), your medicine will be uniform in strength and potency (clones replicate themselves exactly), and you will have saved several months in the process.

The cannabis/hemp/marijuana plant is one of the oldest psychoactive plants known to humanity. Most botanists agree that there are three species: Cannabis sa- tiva, the most widespread, is tall, gangly, and loosely branched, growing as high as 20 feet; Cannabis indica is shorter, about 3 or 4 feet in height, pyramidal in shape and densely branched; Cannabis ruderalis is about 2 feet high with few or no branches. There are also differences among these species in the leaves, stems, and resin. The chemical compounds responsible for the intoxicating and medicinal effects are found mainly in a sticky golden resin exuded from the flowers of the female plants. The function of the resin is thought to be protection from heat and preserva- tion of moisture during reproduction."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"H OW TO G ROW M EDICAL M ARIJUANA 118 www.growmedicine.com Robert Connell Clarke’s detailing of a hempseed from his excellent and highly recommended book Mar ijuana Botan y .

Since you have to start outgrowing from seeds, you will be limited initially by the number of seeds you acquire.

But since few of us have an empty bedroom that isn’t filled with junk or re- served for Aunt Mary’s visits, we have to improvise. Although outdoor plants can reach 10- to-12 feet, your indoor plants will range from 3 or 4 feet-to-a few inches. All houses have several potential grow rooms cleverly disguised as closets. I know highly success- ful growers who grow the best medicine using nothing but closets, attics, basement cubby holes, metal garden sheds, second bathrooms, and kitchen cabinets.

A friend uses an upstairs linen closet and two 4x4x4 metal sheds in the garage—and still has room for the car. If you’re willing to do a little construc- tion, it’s even possible to build two of the grow rooms in one ordinary closet. Hang a small lamp (lighting information starts on page 143) for a Mother Plant, then build a shelf 1½ feet off the floor in the same closet. Install fluorescent lamps under the shelf for your clones. This setup would be ideal for someone with limited space. The mother would sit on the shelf. You could take cuttings from her, then slide the clones directly under the shelf for rooting. In choosing your rooms, don’t elimi- nate a space just because it doesn’t have electricity and ventilation.

About a third of your purchase will go for a high-intensity lamp used in the flowering stage. While it may be possible to grow indoors for less money just using fluorescent lighting, the difference in the quality and quantity of the medicine is not worth it. Computed over a period of years, the costs are negligible. And aside from replacing bulbs every several crops, your future expenses will be limited to electric- ity, fertilizer, cloning supplies and up- grades.

There are three major types of light- ing systems available: incandescent, fluo- rescent, and high-intensity discharge (HID). Incandescent Incandescent lights are horribly inef- ficient (especially the screw-in “grow bulb” type) and really not an acceptable option for plant growth. Although they are inex- pensive to purchase, their cost of operation makes them the costliest source of light. Fluorescent These tubes have tremendous advan- tages over incandescents. They emit about three times as much light as an incandes- cent (given the same wattage), and the light spectrum is one that plants can use more effectively. However, they do have their limita- tions. Light is emitted over a large area, so it is not concentrated.

Florescents are, however, very useful in cloning and starting seedlings. They also put out a more gentle light than the HID lamps and release far less heat. The fact that they produce less heat is very impor- tant to those growing in enclosed and not- especially-well-ventilated spaces. If you can afford no heat build-up at all, however, florescents are the way to go. When using florescents, it is best to purchase the 40-watt “cool white” variety. The ones that are sold as grow lamps (in- cluding Grow-Lux, Vitalite, etc.) are not much more efficient than a standard fluo- rescent and sometimes 10 times the pur- chase price. The slightly different spectrum produced by these lamps does little good for most plants. I have used both types side by side with the same plant genetics and saw little difference in growth.

Large wattage lamps, they are used for lighting streets, parking lots, stadiums and other large areas. They come in two basic types: metal halide and high-pressure sodium. Metal Halides (or MH lamps) These emit a white light that looks slightly bluish. They are used to light sta- diums, convention centers, gymnasiums and other large areas where a natural-look- ing light is desired. Some growers swear by metal halides in the Mother Room for vegetative cycles but use high-pressure so- dium for flowering. High Pressure Sodium (or HPS lamps) These emit a pink or amber light. They are used for lighting parking lots and other areas where the color of the light is not important. HPS units are much more effi- cient than MH, producing more light and less heat per watt of energy consumed.

These lamps are the best for growing. They con- tain an element that puts out blue light to help fill in the parts of the spectrum absent in standard HPS and MH. MH lamps are available in 175-, 200- 400- and 1000-watt sizes. HPS lamps come in 50-, 75-, 150-, 400- and 1000-watt sizes. San Agro comes in 430w and 600w.
