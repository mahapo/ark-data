The social power, respect, re verence, and authority held by the \"pharmacopoeia- practicing\" native shaman was/is a major problem for government and religion. It is the wanton jealousy for the power and control, held by these natives, which in turn, inspired the campaign to demonize and dis-repute Shamanism and pharmacopoeia as something of the devil. The Spanish (Catholic) inquisition and witch hunts (the murdering of over eight million people, tried as witches, and the stealing of their land and other propertiesdone in the name of God by the Church-government up until the 19th century) were prime examples of this. Also related to this church jealousy and greed is the matter of an estimated twenty million indigenous Central Americans murdered (exterminated), br inging about the near extinction of the Aztec/Inca/Mayan peoples, and the all-to-similar fate of indigenous North Americans (\"American Indians\"). The underlying agenda is the repression of the knowledge of Entheogenic plants that, if it succeeded, would insure the people's loya lty to established religion in all matters pertaining to God, primarily due to the inability of experiencing God for oneself. Since government and religion are the controllers of the world, an independent Shaman/Priest/Mage/Magici an/Prophet is a threat to their power. The sacramental use of Entheogens has only come into a bad/dirty light recently. This is largely due to the lumping together of any and all substances used by people (whether used for spiritual or recreation purposes) and then classifying them as \"bad\" (for you), \"evil\", \"vile\", and/or \"dirty\". This prohibition is the propaganda of the inept, corrupt, and oppressive (monetary based) war on drugs. In realty, despite the incredible amount of evidence that humanity's or igins of spirituality are inseparably linked to Entheogens, governmental prohibition continues to rob each individual of their human right to directly access and understand the nature of spirituality thro ugh the traditional and ancient means provided by mother earth. People who follow the government's lead in this field, without researching the subject on an individual basis, are usually quick to jump to conclusions and condemn things they really know nothing about. Unfortunately, there are many peo ple who have not researched this subject and believe that anything the government says must be true, yet they ha ve absolutely no personal experience or real understanding about the subjec t other than the government/media-released propaganda and dis- information geared to create their agenda-based opinion; an opinion really based on ignorance. The agenda of the propaganda-pushers is not only sad but actually quite sickening because of the way it tends to lead the mindless masses of sheep right down the road to foolishness, causing them to become the unknowing pushers of the very same oppressive dis-information and propaganda which imprisons them, whilst believing the whole time that they are being right, proper, clean purveyors of the truth. As you will see, this subject is absolutely a matter of religious practice, and as such, it must be protected by Constitutional rights. As Timothy Leary put it so well, \"Psychedelics often produce psyc hotic and even violent behavior in those that have nev er used them\". The simple reality is that plant Entheogens are spiritual in nature. I prefer \"Just say know\" to the oppressive fascist propaganda \"Just say no\" One more thing before we get going... Its the use of heroin, crack, and cr ank that the government throws on the table to cause panic in the minds of people (claiming ignorance to the efficatious properties of Entheogens), that has allowed them to erode the Constitution away into a now historical document, by passing unbelievable laws all under the guise of stopping the us e of drugs and saving our precious ch ildren from the \"vile drug-pusher\", while all along it's been the O.S.S. and then the C.I.A. in bed with the Mafia and local government officials that bring the highly addi ctive drugs (Heroin/Cocaine/Crack), t hat destroy peoples lives, into the Country, and then distribute them locally. If you don't think this could be true, then take a look at this: The CIA/OSS and the \"War on Drugs\" You have heard the official state position on this, ho w could you miss it unless you were a hermit or just not paying attention. Then again media may still influ ence you even though you aren't paying attention. Now look at the documented evidence. Perhaps our favorite free-thinkers and musicians, by taking certain plants, and smoking certain herbs (also with a long religious history) should be praised for the insight and understanding they have received in life through these things, not be condemne d and thought of as dirty for their use of the same. Of course, Heroin problems are very dangerous and damaging, and I am not talking about that. Besides, it is the highly addictive properties of these drugs that are ex actly what make the Mafia/C.I.A./Government wet their lip s from excitement (due to huge profits involved), not caring what"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"dama ge the y do to peo ple.

"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" What are the origins of the Christmas traditions? Mo st people never think to ask this question. Those that do, find a seemingly complete dogmatic system of explanation. T hen, of course, one day there is that discovery that Santa Claus does not really exist. But... Does he ? Many things have been written in an attempt to trace Christmas' development. You can find people who consider themselves experts in this field, and even books on this subject. I suppos e you could call the field \"Santa-ology\", or perhaps even \"Santa-ism\". Yet, long lost, deeply underlying the realms of simple tradition, are very amazing symbolic connections and origins that are either lo ng- forgotten or were/are intentionally overlooked. The basic philosophy behind Christmas is; if you are good you will receive a present under the tree, if you are bad then you receive no present. In some cultures those who are bad even receive punishment delivered by various means and personages. This is a very simple philosophical system. Santa Claus is an all-knowing icon that reads the hearts and intentions of everyone on the planet. Each child is told the story of the round-man (who wears red and white) and his associates; reindeer, little people and Mrs. Claus. They are also told the story of a miraculous wo rldwide flight in a sleigh which results in presents being delivered under a tree. Yet when a child reache s the age of reasoning he is informed that this story is all a fabrication. This revelation is devastati ng upon the psyche of a young mind. It is also at this time that the child is often comfort ed, and pacified from the shock, by very strong reinforcement that the religious system which the parents or guardians prof ess are indeed factual. And an attempt is made to incorporate the respective religious traditions into t he holiday as the REAL meaning for the celebration. There is an alternative to this cultural conditioning and shock-relief system of indoctrinations, into the realities of life, which is based upon truth and is much more interesting than even the simple traditional understandings of Christmas themselves. The key to this alternative is encoded within the icons and symbols of Christmas. To know the meanings behi nd the symbolism to which most people only attach dogmatic explanations, is to open the doorway to unde rstanding the very roots of many other religions as well. Several books have been written about t he Amanita muscaria mushroom. This mushroom is found growing all over the world under Pine (& other coniferous trees), Birch, and sometimes Oak. The Pine tree is one of the well-known central relics of Christmas. Under this tree is where those who are deemed good find their reward in the form of a pres ent. A big red and white rounded mushroom grows under the very tree we are to look under on Christma s morning to find our gift. If we can find that this present does indeed exist. If we can find that reindeer are thought to be able to fly for a very good reason, and we can show that traditionally they carry people spiritually through the air in a way that defies the laws of time. And further, if we can sh ow that the philosophical idiom \"be good not bad\" is really the universal truth, would we have sufficient basis for discarding the established religious dogmas which traditionally replace the Christmas tale, and instead simply expand the story to reveal the more esoteric principles upon which it is based? It is my assertion that the traditio nal day of reckoning wherein it is revealed; Santa Claus is not real, Reindeer do not fly, there is no present under the tree (unless placed there by a deceiver), is a dis- information campaign geared towards conditioning the young mind to be unable to comprehend the information which is presented herein. I also assert that the devastating blow of the destruction of a belief, and the associated reinforcement of \"Christianit y\" (or other religious system) is psychologically designed to support the replacement information which is given as a comforting foundation during a time of shock and crisis, and is explained as something t hat will never be revealed as false (like Santa and all that fantasy). It is also my conclusion that this event subliminally plays an important role for religious systems that wish to suppress the expansion of consciousness through fear of the unknown. The psyche is scarred deeply when it is forced to deal with realizing it has accepted a falsehood as truth. And when it deals with plants and things found under trees, subliminally, one armors oneself against these concepts. There develops an unconscious fear of falling into the sa me trap. Of course this is also pacified through replacing the meaning of things like the pine tree. Interestingly, in some traditions the Pineal gland is thought to be the seat of the human soul. It is shaped exactly like a pinecone (hence the name Pine-al). Apparently, it is also an autonomous part of the br ain, resting in the dead center, not attached to any other part of the brain; sort of a floating pinecone in the center of the human brain. Perhaps we have a lot more in common with the Pine tree than we thou ght. This gland, and its endogenous secretions, as well as other relevant implications, will be further discuss ed in a later section. But it is interesting to note; due to cultural phenomenon, the pineal gland atrophies during youth, which corresponds to this timely day of reckoning, and even begins to calcify duri ng puberty. This atrophy/ calcification causes a reduction of Pineal endogenous secretions. The Santa Claus and Christmas traditions of today have metamorphosed out of many older mythologies. The icons, symbols, and relics that have managed to survive from the \"Winter Solstice\" celebrations of old, have a commonality that deserves some reflection, study, and perhaps even some reverence. Understanding that these traditions are borrowed ones, is central to getting at the heart of the true meaning of Christmas. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Figure 4.

Thor throws his mushroom-shaped hammer to the ground in a bolt of lightning and a mighty thunderous CRACK. Lightning is the mythical creator of the mushroom. 29. The Small White Stone: The infant state of the mushroom rese mbles a small white stone. 30. The Elixir of Immortality: The churning-of-the-milky-ocean myth describes this in a phenomenal way. 31.

Tuning the mind to wards the higher frequency vibrations, which must be attuned to, in order to conquer death on a Spiritual (which is also physical) level. When the physical body dies, the Spirit is thought to wake, if the hero is able to make this happen. This is the practice of Shamanism, the journey into t he death experience, the deep psyc hological introspection/judgment through plant induced states, in preparation for the inevitability of the ultimate event, the crowning glory of life itself, death. This is at t he forefront of the Shamanic practice, rather than a quest relegated to the deity one worships. It resides at the core of individual experience. One experiences heaven and hell, and all points in-between. The hell being mostly experienced as one recognizes, and then rejects (sometimes kicking and screaming) the deceptions accepted into one's cosmological belief system. Especially where thes e beliefs are deeply imbedded through years of societal conditioning, and are in di rect contradiction with that indige nous spiritual nature of man. They become a second nature thought proce ss, of which everything \"one believes\" relies upon, as the self manifested, yet culturally conditioned, as their f oundation of existence. Much of the conflict between culturally imbedded belief and the naturally experienced indigenous nature of humanity revolves around sexuality. Freud was adamant in his thesis, wherein society must suppress, repress and fully renounce the instinctual drives in order for cultural advanc ement (this is recognition of the motivation behind patriarchal systems). According to Wilhelm Reich: \"F reud's basic idea is that cultural achievements result from sublimated sexual energy, indicating that sexual suppression, or repression, is an indispensable factor in establishing any culture. Now t here is already historical pr oof that this concept is erroneous, for there are highly cultured societies in which sexual suppression is non-existent and whose members enjoy completely free sexual lives. Thus is the nature of indigenous so cieties. It was precisely my attempts at a sex-political critic ism of culture that gave weight to our very first differences of opinion.\" (Italics mine) Wilhelm Reich was talking about this very oppression of humanity's indigenous and natural spirituality, through an attack on individual freedom at its root source, sexuality. Freud's concept is a simple description of Patriarchal, sex-negative, ent heogen denying, religious systems. That philosophy which is carried forward, and enforced by governmental regulation. A clear separation of church and state certainly must excise any attempt toward governmental sexual regulation, outside the scope of rape. And the same must not regulate the ingestion of plant entheogens, which are spiritual in nature. It is the very nature of the establ ished religious/political bond t hat perpetuates t he sex-negative, consciousness repressive society. This repression of mind and body, enforced by religious/governmental genocide, of a ll who resist their attempts at conv ersion, is exactly that life-force in human beings which is crying out from the past for retribution and reestablishment as the true spiritual human nature exiled. It is also always the quest of t he hero to free friends, family and the world from an oppressive damaging tyrant or government. Of course one must first recognize that the tyranny exists, and why. This is the quest that must be carried on, a nd it should not be taken lightly. It is not an easy task, ever. Yet it is the quest of every human inca rnated. The degree to which one accepts the task is oftentimes determined by how much a person is awar e of their surroundings, the repressive nature of their environment, and whether or not they possess, and ar e not afraid to express, a sincere desire to do something about it. It is the very deep conditioni ng, and abstract yet convincing supposed logic, that holds grip upon most of the culturally initiated, in or der to keep them in tow, as faithful servants of that very nature which creates spiritual conflict, and forces beings into reincarnation. Spiritual Death is that which consumes those who are not in contact with indigenous spirituality (which incorporates full individual freedom) but choose, consciously or uncon sciously, to be the repressed and the repressors. Wilhelm Reich was imprisoned, died mysteriously t hereafter, and his books confiscated and burned in the incinerators in New York by the F.D.A., in an attempt to stamp out once again the uprising of the indigenous natural spirituality of humanity, as it trie s to break free of the cor porate/religio-governmentally enforced repression. Shamanism affords one the opportunity to experience these death and rebirth experiences, as practice for conquering actual death, as well as to receiv e the indigenous teaching t hat can be passed on to those interested in doing the same. That this indi genous teaching recognizes the repression of the human soul, on a global level, should not be surpri sing. Each individual knows within themselves the natural path, and is wounded spirit ually through past life experiences of repression. This is imbedded into the psyche, and manifests as a f ear of those authority figures pushi ng this repression, or a fear of challenging them. It is amazing the resistance an indi vidual can muster to a reshaping of their belief system. Fiercely humans hold to their beliefs, reject ing anything that challenges their paradigm. Even to the point of becoming themselves the enforcers of their own oppression . This is exactly that process which one goes through at death. The inability to let go of repressive belief is the conflict that forces death and rebirth, holding one within the revolving door of incarnation which the indigenous Shaman, writers of the Hindu Vedas, call Samsara (the wheel of life). So Shamanism does operate on an individual basis. The teachings are in direct opposition to those societal, religious and political norms. The industrial revolution, high technology, and the established patriarchal systems of Society have consciously attempted to stamp out the indigenous natural cultures of the planet, under the guise of ci vilizing the savage man. I for one am not buying it. If there is to be some type of rebirth of the planet, global enlightenmen t, an entry into a golden age, it must be centered on the true nature of mankind, and not a rehashing of the same old fake status quo.

Amanita muscaria: The Mushrooms that shaped Mankind Part 2 \"We wouldn't be here if it weren't for psychedelic drugs. In terms of the role of psilocybin in human evolution on the grasslands of Africa, people not on drugs were behind the curve. The fact is that, in terms of human evolution, people not on psychedelics are not fully human. They've fallen to a lower state, where they're easily programmed, boundary defined, obsessed by sexual possessiveness which is tr ansferred into fetishism and object obsession. We don't want too many citizens asking where the power and the money really goes. Informed by psychedelics, people might stop saluting. \"Take your political party, your job, whatever, and shove it.\"\" ---Terence McKenna There may be a reason that this mushroom has rema ined hidden for these thousands of years. What has become clear, is that cosmologically every religion on our planet looks forward to a time in the future where man will have direct contact with what can be defined as God. The t housand year reign of the messiah, the new golden age, the return of Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, Mithra, King Ar thur, etc, etc, etc, is a commonality that is the hoped-for reli ef to the people that wish to liv e in peace, and understanding. A time when all lies will be exposed. A time when oppr ession of freedom will cease. A time that hinges completely on truth and reality, not societal delusions of those who wish to control humanity according to their dogmatic and sadistic beliefs. This mushroom play s a huge role in the coming dispensation of this \"Golden Age\". The stories and myths retain their basic structure, but the names of the key players have been changed, as they were incorporated into new religious systems. This is why most religions contain stories of the flood, the creation epic, the attribut es of deities, and similar laws of government. Authors; Sitchin, Bramley and Horn, have written about the extraterrestrial connections in the complex study of mankind, and their so-called gods. Here is my take on the subject after studying this. The clay tablets tell us of the Elohim/Anunnaki who we re extraterrestrial beings that came to our planet from the star \"Sirius\". They genetically manipul ated indigenous beings (which they called beasts) creating the human race. In the tales were father-god, An/Anu, his two sons Enki/Ea and Enlil/Ilu-kur- gal, the primary male beings featured in the story of the creation of the Adam a/Adam & Eve. Enki was very impressed with, and felt compassion towards, the products of this genetic work, namely \"us\", whereas Enlil was of the mind that the beings were only worthy of servitude. The ancient Sumerian gods, and their feuding acts, have been found in late r religious myths with the same basic stories, however, the names Ea, Enki, Enlil, Anu etc, were changed to Ahura Mazda, Jehovah, Lord, Ahriman, Baal, Adon, Etc. Biblical myths of Jacob and Esau, f euding over birthright, are similar to accounts in the Sumerian tales of Enki and Enlil. The Anunnaki, as a wh ole, were compelled to allot for themselves the status of gods over the lowly humans. The archetypal feuding brothers can be stereotyped and categorized by their respective attributes, Enki is also called Adonai (the \"Lord\"), and his (divine) attributes are compassion, wisdom and fertility (sex uality), Enlil is called El Shaddai, The lofty Mountain (YHWH), and \"Jehovah\", he was a storm-god (the br inger of vengeance and wrath) jealous and controlling. Therefore \"The Lord\" and \"Jehovah\" are not one in the same, but two different beings. It was Enki and his sister Ninhu rsag who performed the genetic m anipulation which resulted in the Adama (the ancient name for the first human, Adam and Eve). Humanity was conditioned to be in the service of the gods, but Enki had another plan, whic h set off a continual series of events, which most adversarial myths, concerning the war over the humans, between Enki and Enlil, were fashioned. Enki desired to feed the humans the fruit of the tree of Knowledge. This he knew was the thing which would open the eyes of man, and multi-dimensionalize his consciousness. This did not go over well with the Anunnaki, and Enki was commanded not to allow us th is fruit. It was Enlil that attempted to scare the humans into not eating the fruit by te lling them that, if they ate it, they would die. Enki went against the wishes of the high council and was able to convince them to eat the fruit anyway. When the gods saw what he had done, they condemned the act, and insi sted that the corrupted humans be exiled from the land of paradise. Enki was man's preserver and co mpatriot; Enlil was the bringer of woes and doom. It was also Enki that saved humanity from the flood, which was brought on by Enlil. Enlil also destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, which contrary to current precep ts, were great cities of freedom and learning, not deserving of the jealous and controlling Enlil's destructive rage. Enlil is also purported to have destroyed"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Babylon, confounded the languages (after the tower of Babel incident), and wreaked havoc upon the city of Ur. It is extremely important to understand these original stories, as they were written in the Sumerian tablets, and compare them to the 4000 year later adaptations in t he Bible. Ea/Enki, was the good guy. It was him who fed man of the tree of knowledge. So why the need to flip this story completely upside down and condemn him as the evil one? In the Bibl e the word translated as \"serpent\" is \"nahash\" (NHSH) which literally means to decipher, or to fi nd out. All throughout ancient times the serpent was known as the bringer of knowledge (hence the euphemism \"be ye wise as serpents\") and were the precipitators of enlightenment. It is this precise thing that compels us to look further into the possibility that the good-guy is the one that is condemned throughout religious writings, for teaching freedom and knowledge. The freedoms of plant usage/taking for enlightenment, freedom of sexuality, and even the freedom to not be subservient to those oppressive gods who condemn these things as evil. In the cuneiform symbolism it is the caduc eus (the snake coiled around the staff) that is the representation for Enki, in fact is his personal emblem. After Enki fed the humans of the tree, and was then effectively exiled, those who remained under the control of Enlil and the Anunnaki were then clamped-down-upon, in a heavier way. It was Enlil that was worshiped th rough fear and in later cultures named Jehovah. Enlil, that old extraterrestrial who adamantly opposed the education, freed om, and enlightenment of humanity in every ancient Sumerian myth. A full set of laws would be adopted, the other humans were instructed not to associate with Enki/Ea or the exil ed. So humanity received the first commandments. You will have no other God but Me. Enki especially , and his radical viewpoints, were explicitly condemned as evil. Control of the populace was priority one, to the gods, and glimpses of intelligence, or too much free-thought were \"The Crime\", and not likely to have been politely viewed. But disloyalty to the jealous gods was absolutely forbidden. You will work for six days and then have a day of res t. This will be a holy-day, set aside for worship of the gods. Ritual and ceremony were to be observed, and homage to be paid, refusal was forbidden, under penalty of death. The technologically advance d Anunnaki had no problem convincing the primitive creatures of their superiority. In their role as the gods, their word was life or death, an occasional display of technological power or just plain fear induc ing events, easily kept the followers in line. You will not have sex without the permission of the gods. In a genetic experiment, the production of offspring is controlled. Perhaps the gods had no idea what kind of psychological problems stem from the repression of human sexuality, after all, they are not actually human, but, it seems, they just didn't care anyway. You will not covet the things that you do not hav e. The haves must quench t he desire of the have-nots by making desire a sin. Even the desire for freedom. Acceptance of your present conditions being part of your lot in life must be held up as a high principle virtue, quenching high-mindedness as sin. The other laws are branches of these basic laws. Please, understand that I do not ma ke the previous statements lightly. The implications of what I have just written are dire. The reality is, the cond itioning of the masses, perpetuated by religious organizations, has created and fed that great beast that has been so warned about. To state that the laws given to humanity by nearly every religious system on our planet are not the all knowing's Universal Laws is heresy at the least, blasphemy is a more appropriate terminology. However, I think there is ample evidence to show that some of t hese laws are not universal truth, but are lies and detrimental to the development of Hu manity. Good thoughts and ideals are often used in cults to lure in the unsuspecting victims, then the rules of oppr ession are instilled, cleverly disguised as good wholesome values to the unwary. What kind of a god is it, which says; You are free to choose, as long as you choose to do what I tell you to do, otherwise you will be punished, for a ll eternity, for your disobedience? Going back to Christianity, let me point out that when Jesus wa s asked which of the laws was most important, his answer was enigmatically \"To love God with all your heart, and to Love thy neighbor as thyself\". This certainly shows a completely different view of ever ything. The love of God surely did not mean those driving the slave ships. What he is saying describes a love for something that is far beyond any being knowable. That ineffable, invisible, inde scribable God, which is within you. Mesopotamia is the home of the fabled city, Ba bylon. The laws of the Babylonian king Hammurabi contain an old version of the biblical 10 Commandment s, although they appear to be based upon the philosophy of \"The Golden Rule\", many of the laws are completely absurd. The biblical laws appear to"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"be, at least partially, based upon the laws of a Babylonian king. Hammurabi could not have invented these patriarchal laws, they must have been adopted, from an older source, the Anunnaki/Elohim, and expanded upon by this powerful king. Also some of the Egyptian 12 negative acts are cast from the same blueprint. Initially, human law, was probably a necessity in order to teach the concept of the golden rule. Some laws appear to be a sincere effort to promote this concept, others, such as banning free sexuality, restricting freedom to worship as you choose, and the condemnation of desire to have a better life and possessions, are clearly not. These are geared more towards totalitarian control of an enslaved society. The idealism of a patriarchal soci ety seems to be that same old enslavement idea, only under the guise of the good law, and the delusions of some sort of freedom. Whether the patriarchal laws appeared first in Egypt or in Sume ria does not matter. It is the understanding of what these laws are really all about that is ultimately the crucial factor. Remember (according to Sitchin), these laws were likely to have been initially imposed upon mankind by the extraterrestrial gods from Sirius, who warred among themselves, had fits of jealousy over control and possession, and most likely did not have humanity's best interests at heart. They are not laws that were created by the universal all encompassing God consciousness which humanity attributes them to. The phenomenon of how patriarchal cast e systems adapted the oppressive laws will be dealt with later. While many argue that society could not survive wi thout some sort of governing laws, the ‘Golden Rule’ answers this need more than adequately. Keep in mind also that it was the ope ning of the eyes and mind to the knowledge of good and evil that was forbidden to humanity by these same gods. It's not such a big stretch of the imaginat ion that the questioning of these laws (discerning good from evil for ourselves) is important. It is a logical course to follow if one is to consider basing ones whole philosophical understanding of life itse lf upon them, and in fact a full and unbiased investigation of them is in order. If a Human sees for himself the differ ence between good and evil, he can no longer be told something that conflicts with what he knows. Obviously if man is forbidden acce ss to this knowledge for himself, somebody must have something to hide. The name Enki means \"Archetype\", which is precisely what he was, an archetype for the post- Sumerian gods. Turning to our anthropomorphism of the mushroom theme, we find more interesting connections. Even beyond the above discussed fruit- of-the-tree-story. Enki and his sister Ninhursag were the creators of the Adama. The red of t he mushroom cap, as well as the juice, are anthropomorphized as blood, and figuratively related to as fire. The cap is also considered the female genital organ, as was the cup (like the Holy Grail) from ancient times. While the mushroom stem is the phallus. Anthropomorphically the mushroom is andr ogynous, in one sense, being one entity yet having both male and female sexual organs visible. In anothe r sense it is two separate beings, joined together, in the act of creation, albeit only the sexual organs are visible. Enki is the stem, Ninhursag the cap, the two joining in accord to produce the Adama, anthropomorphism of the mushroom into the two elementary archetypal creators. Fu rther evidence is the substance fed to the faithful of Enlil and Ninhursag known as \"Star-Fire\". This supplemental nourishment was produced fr om the lunar essence, or blood (from the womb), of the goddess Ninhursag. It is also called \"the gold of the gods\" and even \"the red gold\". After the epic Anunnaki's abandonment of humanity, brought about by the fall of Babylon, when Enlil sabotaged the city, confounded the langu ages, and allowed the city to be laid waste. Some myths tell us; when the Anunnaki withdrew, \"like birds taki ng flight\", they took with them the 'Star-fire', or at least the knowledge of what the 'Star-fire\" was. The priestly caste which remained, now under siege, needed again, to take the knowledge underground. Much as the later alchemists, the knowledge of putting the gold to-the-fire to create the alchemical gol d, the secret of enlight enment, kept the process a secret. Real gold, when put to the fire, melts. Y ou do not have an end product that can then be ingested. As we have seen 'gold' is a polymorphous representat ion of the mushroom, the color of the cap-skin is gold (when dried) and also reddish-gold AND it must be put-to-the-fire for the process of de- carboxylation (literally an alchemical chemical-chang e) to occur before ingesting it properly. So the Anunnaki 'Fire-stone' is another one of those substances which has a mu ltitude of descriptive features, Fire, Gold, Red, Female organ, Blood, juice, and ev en \"nourishment that bestows enlightenment\", all of which can be easily understood in terms of mushro om polymorphous and anthropomorphic imagery. It is also directly related to the pineal gland, the tree of life, the manna (or shem-an-na, which the Sumerians claimed was made from Highward-fire-stone), the Greek ambrosia, the Egyptian scheffa-food, and the Vedic soma. It was the most secret and powerful th ing known to the Anunnaki, and was not meant for humans, at least in the eyes of the Enlilian regime. But for our archetypal provider and protector Enki, and his sister, our \"mother-creator\", Ninhursag, it was something that we evidently needed. By the way, Ninhursag, in Egypt, is known as Isis, the mother of all the living, and theref ore is the archetype of Maya, Mary, Ishtar, Diana, etc. In the Egyptian book of the dead, the pharaoh, who is searching for the ultimate food-of-the-gods, continuously repeats the stat ement \"what is it?\" at every step of his journey. This question is the very definition given for the enigma tic 'Manna' in the Jewish records. What is this 'Star-fire'? That which humanity has been forbidden by the Anunnaki, at least those Anunnaki which do not wish humanity to succeed, and in the case of Enlil, were willing to wreak all manner of deception and destruction to keep it a secret.

So people surrender their souls to belief systems that put them into the position of going to work recruiting other souls for the same master. The surrender of ones soul to any deity is something not to be taken lightly. In other words, before you do something like t hat, it is admirable and pr udent to fully research, from both viewpoints, the validity of the system and documents that you are putting your faith in. This is the way to really look at anything, look at it completely from both sides. And even then, you may believe that you have found the corre ct way, the proper path, the ultimate reality, but surrendering your soul and recruiting souls just seems to be a strange requirement from any almighty deity. It is simple to see, if you can control a pers ons sexuality you can get them to believe anything. Government enforces the religion of the dark lords. The concept of guil t, associated with sex, is an ancient tool for control. The oppressor says \"Sex is bad, unless I say its okay\". As in, you must have a license to engage in licentious behavior. There are far too many forms of totalitarian dictatorship, with government enforced religious law. \"Follow Your Bliss\" remains one of the truest thoughts on religious freedom. Even with all of the negative connotations heaped upon it by religious sy stems (who want control) contorting it to be a statement of evil, with such pedant ic reasoning as \"So if I want to kill It's okay?\" ignoring the golden rule as the first law of following ones bliss. Secret Societies have a great motto \"Ordo Ab Chao\" meaning \"Order Out of Chaos\". Agendas are formulated designed to give the powerful more powe r. Chaos is created, and media blitzed. Then cries go out for solution. Laws are passed which could never have been passed without the chaos. The order, has reigned through deception of the ma sses, and the agenda is accomplished. The Fascist state that is being created by these secr et societies is indication that there is fear of the average person on the street. Fear of detection that the religions, governments and corporations behind this agenda are destroying humanity. How can it be that a world so rich with resource s can still be a world where poverty and hunger are still in such great abundance? Those who seek fortune from the exploitation of other human beings seem to be the pillars of the planetary hier archy. The Governments with their holy contractual ceremonies, The churches with their vast wealth, The Bankers and mo ney brokers who run the economy so the rich and powerful get more rich and powerful while the poor are ground into destitution and the middle class collapses into obscurity. This very same governmental/religious/capitalistic hierarchy that is destroying the planetary environment, disguised as those very in stitutions that are supposed to be helping it, is grabbing up property ownership under the guise of turn ing public lands into preserves [This in America]. This follows the very same pattern s that have recurred throughout history, greed, corruption, and fascism waving the illusionary flag of freedom. Freemasonry is the secret organizat ion famous for its use of Christianity as a tool for control. The King James version of the Bible, edited by Sir Francis Ba con, a 33rd degree Freemason, is used to create order in society through the implementation of a belief system geared towards their Fascist ideologies. The chaos is carefully orchestrated to insure the pa ssing of more and more laws that will, eventually, completely destroy freedom. This is why there is more and more morality being preached by politicians. Priests and politicians speaketh with forked tongue, out of one side comes the illusion of tolerance and understanding, while the other side says you had better believe what I believe or you are in trouble. Just remember that freedom does not say you are only free to do what you are told to do. If there ever would be some kind of genocide where all of the non- believers are put to death, this too would be nothing more than a recurrence of what has happened all along, on our planet. Fascism rears its ugly head, and must take control of every aspect of the individual’s life, therefore insuring that no one will decent, no one will challenge the authority of whatev er religio-political image is portrayed to the populace. If, in fact, Sitchen is right, the extra-terrest rial gods did indeed plan t the seeds of humanity, and others who elaborate on his findings, and these gods have been with us all along, which by the way, religion claims to be the case, \"the Gods are ever pr esent\". Expected events will be more of the same old repression and oppression that has been going on ever since the beginning. Even in Mesopotamia, where Sitchen says humanity were slaves of the \"Man Gods\", who had power and authority, who kept the secrets of their realm to themselves, IE: \"Don’t eat of the tree of Knowledge\", those who were given the gift of power seem doomed to prosper from the suffering of others. This does not need to be the case. This planet is filled with wealth, however phi lanthropy, and even kindness are as always lacking. What else should be expected from those who find pleasure in the suffering of others? And this is the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"legacy of religion and government on our planet. If it's not one form of genocide, it's another. Even if it means standing up to the ones that ar e in charge of this whole mess, somebody must awaken and do something drastic. If some expected messiah appears, but he comes from the same school as any of the gods of the old world (especially those in Mesopotamia) then the world must prepare for another ride into hell, for as the worl d is becoming, so it shal l become. The scholarship involved in the disproving of the worlds religious systems is not an easy task, as everywhere you look they all say \"I am right\". In my studies I have found that all of them are wrong. Especially those that are blatantly forceful in th eir attempt to control the human mind through false moral and dogma systems. The fruits of religion are frustration, depression, and despair, because they are bent on controlling the freedoms of thought, sexuality, and worship, in cluding entheogenic Plant use, and condemn real understanding. This is the current state of the systems imposed upon our planet. It wouldn't be so bad if we were just talking about rich people acquiring we alth and making something of themselves, but we are talking about is a societal force deeply rooted in the banking, governments and religions which is gearing up to instill a \"New World Order\" which will fo rce dogma and beliefs on the entire world. Just as the people in Mesopotamia believed that they needed the gods, so do people today trudge along in their oblivious stupors, unaware of the mechanisms that are usurping all that stands for freedom. Active participation in society, ignoring the usurpation, is in my estimation exactly the apathy that allows it to continue full speed ahead. The destruction of mankind appears to be the nature, for some reason, of the patriarchal systems that took over somewhere arou nd eight thousand years ago. Whether or not this is the inherent nature of the Patriarchy remains to be proven, yet by the looks of things their nature seems to leave allot to be desired. Why is it that the idea is popularized (through me dia) there are two things you should never talk about, religion and politics. This is because dialogue between people is the real enemy of the state, just as true freedom of thought has become \"THE\" crime. Discussi ons of religion and government eventually arrive at conclusions that are not in the interest of the authorities. Uncensored conversation allows people of different levels, and fields of understanding, to ac tually learn from one and other. No one can expect everyone else to have the same viewpoint as they do, because everyone's paths in life are different. Some people know about this, and some people know about that. Its a big world out there and there is much to learn. Anyone who tells you that the quest for immortality is as simple as one belief has not done his/her homework. People under this assumption might want to hold off on becoming the instrument of preaching that to your friends and fam ily. It just might not be that simple. \"EGYPTOLOGY\" Forerunner to Christianity and source for much of the world's Mythology > [NOTE: Egyptology is really a dogma entrenched prej udiced study of the Egyptian theology.

The ritual itsel f, inside the gr eat p yrami d, was a three d ay lon g orde al. It takes pl ace i n the centra l chamb er wher e the initi ate was plac ed i n a death- like tran ce. This death- like tranc e is in duce d by the Amanita musc aria, whose u nique pr op erties have b een pre viousl y shown. Christia nity, which o wes most of its my ths to Eg yptol ogy/Ast ro-theo log y, d epicts th is ritual as the mushro om ind uced de ath of the god on the cross, b urial i n the tom b for three da ys ( wherei n ther e is a desce nt i nto, and a mi nistering to those in H ades), and then res urrectio n, after the stone is rol led a way from t he tomb. After the deat h-lik e state is induc ed, the initiat e descen ds into H ades and d oes the work of lifting up l ost soul s through ministeri ng i n charit y, and g ood dee ds. T his death like state is somethi ng a dminist ered b y the priest in the ritual. T he hier ogl yphic s ymbol for pri est is a horiz ontal l ine with a verti cal lin e to the ri ght, and a connecting 45 degr ee line at the radi us, a pit cher balanc es atop the vertic al line, pointing left, and a jag ged l ine (lik e a river) po urs out of the pitcher to t he left o f the bottom ho rizonta l lin e.

Ho peful ly th e theor y"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"presented here will spark further research, and eventua lly this will be understood as it was meant to be. According to Manley P. Hall, and also echoed by Peter Tompkins; \"The candidate (the illumined of antiquity) passed through the mystic passageways and chambers of the great pyramid, entering its portals as men and coming forth as Gods. The candidate was laid in the great stone coffin (sarcophagus) and for three days his spirit -freed from its mortal coil- wandered at the gateways of eternity. His \"KA\" (as a bird) flew through the spirit ual spheres of space. He discovered that the entire universe is life, the entire universe is progress, the entire universe is eternal growth. Realizing that his body was a house that he could slip out of and return to without death, he achi eved actual immortality. At the end of three days he returned to himsel f again, and having thus personally and actually experienced the great mystery, he was indeed an init iate -one who beheld and one for whom religion had fulfilled her duty bringing him to the light of God.\" Through personal experience I can see plainly the truth behind this initiatory rite. While experiencing the effects of the Amanita muscaria one surely ascends towards the heavens, and descends towards the abyss. Interesting that the under-world is ca lled Amenta, which I see as accessible through the Amanita, the linguistic relation is astounding. The ex perience of the abyss is easily recognized as every atom of the self is dashed to pieces in the self-i ntrospection and judgment that accompanies the plunge into that vortex which spirals downward to the comp lete annihilation of the self. The flash of ones life before ones eyes leaves no stone unturned as each and every event of ones life surfaces into the consciousness. This is where one learns the humility of the adept, the infallibility of perfection and the inevitability of error. \"Judge not that ye be not j udged\" becomes ever so clear in retrospect, and the \"heart that is light as a feathe r\" suddenly becomes the most valuable element in the universe. The profound effect of direct sunlight, especially the sunrise, is somethi ng that can only be described as a \"Born into the Light\" experience. Each atom of the body can be felt to change somehow as the light traveling through the body can be distinctly sensed each micrometer of the way. Once it finishes its course, and the complete body is engulfed, there is an incredible \"stepping through\" experience, wherein the glorious beauty and ecstasy of the he avens unfold. This is an experience of the most profound and unique type. As far as I know, it is the only Entheogen that produces this effect, and in fact this IS that proscribed experience t hat all the ecstatic religious writings refer to. This initiation ritual is certainly a prescribed methodology for the ultima te experience that a human can have. Knowing the up- and-down effect that the Mushroom has, which is much like an elevator ride, reaching indefinable realms of the heavens, followed by a sudden plunge to the depths, then an up-sweeping again to the ascent, it can seem random or at least unpredictabl e at best. This Egyptian guided experience, that holds one down in the depths for three days, then by design moves the initiate into the sunlight to begin the ascent, reminds me of a slingshot. The further back (down) you pull the project ile (initiate) the further (higher) it (he) goes. This, combined with the multi-dimensionality associated with the enigmatic attributes and energy fields of the pyramid itself (the full understanding of which is NOT available to us - and in fact our understanding can only be termed as infantile in our times) makes for an enigmatic voyage of the soul of man. The concepts and mechanics of which have been locked away from our limited understanding for thes e thousands of years, beneath a myriad of symbols and relics. That it must have been known, due to the recurring cycles of the ev olution of man, that at some point in time, the secrets of this mystery would be re-discovered, only adds to this enigma of the past. The prophecies and revelations of those mystics the world over, who te ll of an ushering in of the new golden age, remain void of fulfillment. But perhaps not forever. In the past, as today, the acceptance and challen ges of these steps of initiation could have been the product of man's desire and search to understand the meaning of life, or the desire to help mankind progress, through diligent effort of individuals with compassion. These are admirable motivations. However, there is always the threat of a more sinist er motive, which is the desire for power. This dark desire seems to be the source of the obscuration of this entire concept. It is my opinion that those without pure intent (hearts as light as a feather) wo uld be unable to withstand the powers invoked in the fullness of this true ritual. The results of which, for those dark souls, may be death or insanity. This failure rate may be the r eason for the falling away from the use of this rite in its fullness. It can be demonstrated by the condition the world is in. After a ll, it is those secret societies (which follow this Egyptian model) that control the finances, government s, and religious systems that currently plague the planet with perversions of truth and fascist a gendas not becoming of the truly enlightened. In looking at ancient Egyptian texts available to us today we find many references to foods. These foods play an important part in the rituals of the anci ent Egyptians. There are a number of hieroglyphic depictions of plants (many of which are psychedelic) on walls and within texts throughout Egypt. This is to be expected, yet this goes undetected or dismisse d by most who are studying Egypt and its religious writings. This is very strange when one reads texts such as found in The Egyptian book of the Dead. Here we see that this food is central to the ritual. The Papyrus of Ani (The doctrine of eternal life) "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"He thirsts not, nor hungers, nor is sad; he eats the bread of Ra and drinks what he drinks daily, and his bread also is that which is the word of Keb, and that which comes forth from the mouths of the gods. He eats what the gods eat, he drinks what they drink, he li ves as they live, and dwells where they dwell; all the gods give him their food that he may not die. Not only does he eat and drink of their food, but he wears the apparel which they wear, the white linen and sandals; he is clothed in white, and he goeth to the great lake in the midst of the Field of Offerings whereon t he great gods sit; and these great and never failing gods give unto him [to eat] of the tree of life of which they themselves do eat. Now we can plainly see that this \"Food of the Gods\" has some major significance for the Egyptians. We cannot overlook the \"food\" is also referred to as bread (see Christian sacrament), and perhaps most importantly it is referred to as \"The tree of Life\". No w it must become apparent that this tree was not new when Christianity adopted it, neither was it new w hen the Sumerians depicted it. Quite likely it was not new when the Egyptians wrote it about either. What is apparent is that this re lic was adapted throughout time by diverse cultures and religions from a common so urce. My speculation as to the specific origin is not important, what I am attempting to point out is t he commonality of these specific titles given to this \"Celestial Food\" and the multitude of paralleling references and titles of \"it\". Let's examine some more from t he \"Egyptian book of the dead\". \"Homage to thee, Osiris, Lord of eternity, King of the Gods, whose names are manifold, whose forms are holy, thou being of hidden form in the temples, whose Ka is holy. Thou art the governor of Tattu (Busiris), and also the mighty one in Sekhem ( Letopolis). Thou art the Lord to whom praises are ascribed in the name of Ati; thou art the Prince of divine food in Anu. It can be argued that this \"Divine food\" is a mysteri ous thing that is inaccessible to humans, however, what good would all of these references to this subst ance be if it were not some thing to actually eat for the initiates? And furthermore; Is there any actual reference to it being anything other than an actual food? And again: May Ra give glory, and power, and truth-speaking, and the appearance as a living soul so that he may gaze upon Heru-khuti, to the KA of the Osiris the Scribe Ani, who speaketh truth before Osiris, and who saith: Hail, O all ye gods of the House of the S oul, who weigh heaven and earth in a balance, and who give celestial food Above we see powerful praises given to the gods who give celestial food. Who is doing all of this praising? Certainly it is not the gods praising the gods, but the initiate s who are the recipients of the food (from the gods) who would praise them for their gift. Still again: May I look upon the Lords of the Tuat, or, according to another reading, the Company of the Gods; may I smell the savor of the divine f ood of the Company of the Gods Grant ye to me my mouth that I may speak therewit h, and cause ye that sepulchral offerings shall be made unto me in your presence, for I know you, and I know your names, and I know also the name of the mighty god before whose face ye set your celestial food Others, however, say that it is the way by which Fa ther Tem travelleth when he goeth forth to Sekhet- Aaru, [the place] which produceth the food and sust enance of the gods who are [in] their shrines. Thy KA riseth up with the celestial food hu and tchefau. Consider this explanation given in the translation notes: Tchefau according to E.A. Wallace Budge, is the nam e of the food on which the gods lived, And may be compared to the Ambrosia and Nectar on which the gods lived on Olympus. Hu is called the god of taste, and in the papyrus of Ani it states that the gods Hu and Saa were created from the drops of blood that landed on the ground when Ra cut off his phallus. Bu dge states also that although it is known that Hu and Saa were nature gods, their exact role and part has not been satisfactorily made out. We cannot dismiss the similarities within the above when we compare the phallus of Rhudra (Red Hindu god whose red phallus grows in the forest). Nor the appearance of the mushroom s in the mythology of Odin wherein his horse's spittle mingled with bl ood, as it hit the ground, sprouted the Amanita mushrooms. Hu and Saa are again anthropomorphized mushroom gods (of nature). We also see another reference to the god being hidden (below)."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" The God cometh forth from his hidden place, [and] tchefau food falleth from the eastern horizon of heaven at the word of Nut. Coming forth from his hidden place is directly associ ated here with the tchef au food appearing from the heavens. Now there comes a very interesting passage that I will put to you (the reader) for dissection. See if you realize the parallel that I will draw forthwith. \"Horus is both the divine food and the sacrifice\" As pointed out by John Allegro (The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross) Jesus has a duality. He is both the man (or god) and the mushroom (the food) and of co urse the sacrifice (the mushroom dying in order to be eaten). This is serious parallelism that must be considered when attempting to understand the passages wherein Jesus is explaining the \"two Mannas \" in the book of John and why his flesh must be eaten. And more: Let the gods of the Tuat be afraid of me, and let them fight for me in their halls. Let them see that thou hast provided me with food for the festival. I am one of those Spirit-souls who dwell in the Light-god. I have made my form in his Form, when he cometh to Tetu. I am a Spirit-body among his Spirit-bodies; he shall speak unto thee the things [which concern] me. Would that he would cause me to be held in fear! Would that he would create [in them] awe of me! Let the gods of the Tuat be af raid of me, and let them fight for me [in their halls]. I, even I, am a Spirit-s oul, a dweller in the Light-god, whose form hath been created in divine flesh. Perhaps the reader will not be so astonished now when I put forward the concept that the \"Divine Flesh\" which is being referred to is the flesh of the divine mushroom, Amanita muscaria. Now let us move forward to see what special abilities (or protection) is obtained for those who understand what all of this is talking about. [If] this Chapter [be known by the deceased], he sha ll come forth pure by day after his death, and he shall perform every transformation that his soul desire th to make. He shall be among the Followers of Un-Nefer, and he shall satisfy himself with the food of Osiris, and with sepulchral meals. He shall see the Disk [of the sun], he shall be in good case upon ear th before Ra, and his word shall be truth in the sight of Osiris, and no evil thing whatsoever s hall have dominion over him for ever and ever. I have already pointed out that the Egyptian book of t he dead is not exclusively for the deceased, but for those who die and are reborn (as in the death and rebi rth experience) and is a type of map of the out-of- body world (spiritual dimension). The concept of coming forth pure by day (being reborn) has certain attributes. Coming forth pure could be the new understanding that is achieved through this experience, allowing the experiencer to shed the old guilt-ridde n self and become new and pure. This is one of the things I stress over and over again, that true under standing allows one to shed guilt because it is realized that the guilt itself is caused by false dogma. The last sentence being \"no evil thing shall have dominion over him for ever and ever\" being the finalit y of true realization, wher ein, no evil thing (false law or law-giver) will ever be able to drag him down into the pit of guilt and despair again. Now we must approach a point which must be made, and understood, as to the secrecy of the mushroom and why it has been kept only for certain \"chosen\" individuals all throughout time. Many people have questioned \"Why is this a secret?\" or \"Wher e do you get the idea that this is the secret?\" Or even \"Who are you referring to when you say they kept it a secret?\" As I have said before, I feel this knowledge is now for everyone. All of mankind can now know and understand this, should their paths lead them in the right direction. Seek and ye shall find has more meaning when information is openly available. For many this concept has gone un-ans wered throughout time and these ancient secrecy- keeping ideas may have been the reason. It must be poi nted out that this is the Egyptian version of the concept of keeping \"the secret\". T he Celestial food playing a central ro le within the teachings of \"The Egyptian book of The Dead\" it can be argued that \"t his\" is the reasoning for the secrecy (The knowledge of what exactly the celestial food is) for if one is to fully realize the book and its meaning the knowledge of what this food is would be a high priority. Theref ore fully revealing the secr et of the book would be the revealing of the true identity of the substance (the celestial food). Again from the Egyptian book of the Dead: Let not the multitude [know of it] except thyself and the beloved friend of thy heart. Thou shalt do this book in the seh chamber on a cloth painted with the star s in colour all over it. It is indeed a mystery. The dwellers in the swamps of the Delta nad everywhere there shall not know it. It shall provided the Khu"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"with celestial food upon in Khert-Neter. It shall supply his Heart-soul with food upon earth. It shall make him to live for ever. No [evil] thing shall have the master over him. And: Thou shalt not perform this ceremony before any human being except thine own self, or thy father, or thy son, because it is an exceedingly great mystery of the Amentet, and it is a type of the hidden things of the Tuat. When this ceremony hath been performe d for the deceased, the gods, and the Spirit-souls, and the dead shall see him in the fo rm of Khenti-Amenti, and he shall have power and dominion like this god Much in the same vein as the \"Pearls before swin e\" parable, here we see specific exclusionary concepts pertaining to the book, the food, and the ritual itself. Herein we have overtones of the very essence of the Egyptian Mystery Schools. The secret oaths and combinations which have kept this mystery under lock and key for far too long may have had their time, but no longer. It is of course my understanding that this food is the central element to the Egyptian religion (as it is in many others) and the central and deepest kept secret of the many exclusive secret soci eties that were to follow in its footsteps. As in Egypt so in the rest of the world, the mushroom (cel estial tree-of-knowledge/life) is the central (hidden) and most important element within religion itself. And finally: May the goddess Sekhmet raise me, and lift me up. Let me ascend into heaven, let that which I command be performed in Het-ka-Ptah. I know how to use my heart. I am master of my heart-case. I am master of my hands and arms. I am master of my legs. I have the power to do that which my KA desireth to do. My Heart-soul shall not be kept a pr isoner in my body at the gates of Amentet when I would go in in peace and come forth in peace He shall be in high favour with the king, and with the shenit nobles of his court, and there shall be given unto him cakes and cups of drink, and portions of flesh, upon the altar-t able of the Great God. KMT or Khemit (Al Khemit) The ancient name for Egypt Al Khemit: (Ancient Egypt) The heart of the lost civilization Much has been said about the great pyramid at Giz eh, and the ancient temples of the region along the Nile, yet even after thousands of years of wonder there still remains a hidden and vast amount of information that research and study can not explain. O ne of the biggest problems in putting the pieces of the puzzle together is there is so much erroneous and false information about it, which is accepted as fact. Dates of 2,500 to 3,500 BCE as the dates of construction of the pyramids at Gizeh, and other structures in the region, should be taken with a grai n of salt. Taking into consideration the predominance of obvious dogma associated with nearly everythi ng concerning Egypt, including the very name of the place, which is actually Al Khemit or KMT, Egyp t being the Greek name given after their occupation of the area, it should be no surprise that much info rmation is hidden about the true religious history of those North African peoples. A land that has been stripped of its histor y, religion, and even its very name by those who conquered and re-conquered the area. A perfect example of the dogma is the accepted Egyptologist's explanat ion of the construction of the pyramids. Two technologies/methods were needed and are describ ed, in the ancient texts, for constr uction. One is the blocks had to be quarried, cut out of solid granite. The tools in the Eg yptian museum, in Cairo, supposedly used for this are copper chisels, and round rocks. Anyone who has ev er tried to dent a granite rock with a chisel (let alone a copper one) and has seen the precision of t he cuts in the granite artifacts knows this is impossible. A round rock beating another rock (granite ) is even more unlikely. It is known that some of the artifacts were produced by this method, but t hose items are obviously produced in this way, and do not show anything like the precision craftsmanship found on the sarcophagus in the pyramid of Khefren. In fact the difference is obvious and astounding. T hen there is the problem of moving the granite stones into place. The standard explanation of floating granite blocks on boats and rolling them up ramps to the top of the pyramids is dumbfounding. Some of t he granite blocks, statues, and obelisks weigh in excess of 1,200 tons! That is about 2.5 million pounds. You can not roll a 2.5 million pound chunk of Granite across sand (or even hard pan) with logs or anythi ng else, period. In fact the largest cranes on the planet can not even lift anything that heavy. These two feats of wonder, cutting the granite and moving it (lifting it into place), which cannot be done today, ev en with our highest technology, point to ancient abilities beyond our understanding.

And it is also the supposed idea that the teacher is able to impart this knowled ge to one who is ready. Once again we see that there is a hierarchical order involved in the dispersi on of knowledge and withholding of knowledge which theoretically trickles down to even the lowly uninitiated if he is ready. The reality of this type of system is that it is flawed by its very concept of withhold ing anything from anybody. The hope of any student to find a teacher for whom their devotion is worthy must be determined by the amount of knowledge a particular teacher has. The limits of the knowledge of the teacher ar e the limits of the student. Teachers are never willing to admit they are not qualified to teach, so instead they claim to be all knowing. Absolute and total devotion to the guru is an integr al part to Buddhism; even refuge is taken in the dharma and the guru's interpretation of it. I point this out as a preface to saying that the higher teachings of Buddhism involve the taking of the mushroom (t he 'death of the ego' yoga or 'death yoga'), a teacher who does not know about this is somewhere on the path to finding it out (as we all are). There is much to understand and study in esoteric Buddhism. Of a ll the several varieties the lightning path method (Vajrayana) is the one that claims enlightenment to be possible in a single lifetime. The others Hinayana and Mahayana (The big slow boat) speak in terms of it taking hundreds, thousands, and even hundreds of thousands of lifetimes to attain enlightenment (whatever you think that means). Now to me, the Vajrayana, lightning fast method seems like the most pr omising. It is this Vajra (Lightning) that holds the key, and hence the very name Vajrayana. The mushroom's association with lightning has seed mythological import. In anc ient mythologies it was imagined that where lightning struck, there would grow the mushrooms (and some even still hold to this belief). Lightning, as myth, is always associated with clouds, rain and also that all-important element for mushroom growth, water. As an example; Thor throws his hammer (mushroom) to earth and in a fl ash of lightning accompanied by a thunderous crack it appears on the ground. A look at the hammer will back this up, if it seems unlikely that the hammer is the mushroom. It can be thought of as the Buddhist Vajra, which also resembles a mushroom, and is associated with lightning. Understand; this lightning-fa st enlightenment is brought about by the deathlike experience attained through the Vajra/Mushroom initia tion. Without it the t eaching and entire concept loses its very heart and soul. So as I was saying a teacher worth devotion will understand this, and those that don't? Well, all are on the path. Meditation and visualization techniques are commonl y represented as a complete form of practice, and certainly they are effective in themselves to a certain extent yet I am certain that the different techniques were actually developed in order to expedite the processes one goes through while in the amanita realms of consciousness. The centering, focusing, concentrating and controlled visualization is very helpful when time dissolves and the soul is put thr ough the proverbial ringer. I have always heard stories of Yogis or Teachers of various practices claiming to attain the ultimate consciousness without any exogenous chemicals, yet the ultimate is extremely experiential, therefore who can really say? It's like comparing apples with oranges, or better yet listening to someone else compare apples with a fruit which they have never tasted. It also must be consid ered that all brain functi ons are the result of an electrical-chemical operation (not that all consciousness is only that) but dreams, near-death- experiences, psychic phenomenon and visions have been linked to endogenously (naturally) produced chemicals within the brain itself. Namely; Pinoline (an M.A.O.I.) and Dimethyltryptamine (D.M.T.) which are secreted by the pineal gland. This will be dealt with in greater depth at a later time. The only experience one can really understand is that which th ey have experienced for themselves (especially in terms of enlightenment or portions thereof). Ancient Buddhist traditions that are still practiced today (at the higher initiatory levels) involve isolation in a cave in darkness. This level of initiation is known to produce quite the experience, but why? The realit y is when an aspirant goes into the cave (and is isolated from light) for an extended period of time t he pineal gland reactivates and produces the natural Ayahuasca (chemicals mentioned earlier) and higher br ain functioning (mystical) results are achieved. This can be claimed (to have been done) without the aid of entheogenic chemicals as none were taken physically into the body. But to claim that no chemicals were involved is highly in error. The same can be said for many other practices (including sexual e cstasy), which produce a plethora of various brain- chemical activities. So it is that each, and I wo uld assume all, various practices associated with enlightenment within Buddhism (as well as other sy stems) have been developed to create certain brain- chemical functions whether by endogenous or exogen ous means. This is the seed elemental concept by which all mystical experience can be measured. C hemicals are the multi-dimensional doorways by which humans achieve expanded states of consciousness, and even those states that are thought to be natural (and in fact are the produc t of natural chemicals) must still be considered electro-chemical in nature. When I first started studying Buddhism I was extremely impressed with the iconography of the deities within the Bardo (Tibetan transition states between incarnations) because I had literally seen and become one with them. In fact many times when I de scribe the various Bardo stages of the soul passing from one lifetime to another, people react similarly. They understand it, because they have seen it. I won't go into it too much here but for those intere sted there is a video set out by the late Joseph Campbell called \"Transformations of Myth through time\" wherein he describes the visions within the Bardo quite exquisitely. It would also (on another not e of expanded study) be very illuminating to read \"The Psychedelic Experience\" by T. Leary, R. Metzner and R. Alpert (Ram Das) which is a manual based upon the Tibetan book of the dead wherein the authors explore the concept that the book is not only for the dead and dying but that it is in fact a manual of the of-of-body realms experienced when"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"taking LSD. However, it is my opini on that the manual is exactly this except that it was not LSD but Amanita muscaria that was the entheogen used. T here are several others who have thrown some weight to this idea (and also that it is the Amanita which is likely to be the entheogen used in the highest initiatory levels in Buddhism) unfortunately most of these people are rather tunnel-visionary towards Buddhism and categorically reject anything that describes Buddhism as something less than perfect. Much like the limited intellect of fundamentalist Christians they prov ide evidence that Amanita muscaria was known and used in ancient Buddhist practices (at the highest levels) but ignore the rest of the story. Buddhism is no different than any of the other religions that see fit to withhold critical information from everyone but the highest level initiates (if even then). Amanita muscaria is the Amrta and the wish fulfilling jewel, it is symbolized by the torma cakes and the stupa, is literally the Vajra in Vajrayana and it can be understood quite clearly why this is consid ered the lighting-fast method to enlightenment.

Do the secrets of freemasonry have anything to do really with any philosophy or truth? Or is it just a social order to keep group ties stron ger? The group ties only keep those who control the agenda stronger, the rest of the members only are allowed to believe they are stronger. The secrets may be there, but they are reserved fo r those who fit a certain profile, and the rest are only allowed to know those things which wi ll keep them supporting the members who are ranked above them. These are the Fascist agenda societal morals and dogma of the big lie. Revealing the secrets of Entheogens, one of the most closely guarded secrets of Freemasonry (as well as many other secret societ ies), is something that can only be done by a layman (non-member). This is because if you have initiation at that level you could not discuss it any further. Secret Societies are called Secret Societies because they keep certain secrets. I have spoken personally with High Priests and Bishops (Secret Society Initiates), who simply told me that they could not discuss anything with me because of their oaths of secrecy. In fact they were so blown away that I knew the info rmation, that it scared the hell out of them. Entheogens, and particularly the Amanita muscaria, are a huge secret. The initiatory rites, into this particular field, are so far up the totem pole of secret societies and religions that when you find those who know, they really freak out, that anyone else knows, because it cuts to the deepest recesses of their self perceived spirituality, and cuts to the center of their most secret God/Society given indoctrination experiences. Th ey have this certain look in their eyes, and unless you somehow are perceived as a threat to them, they invariably have the need to tell you that they do know what you are talking about (w hich is likely a violation of oath in itself), but they cannot discuss it further. This has left me not only feeling dis-enfranchised but sometimes pretty upset. Which has led to some severe, ye t moderated, chastisement from me. Actually, I have nothing against any of those initiates that I have spoken with, personally (including those that knew about it), but secrecy itself is a problem of high proportional magnitude, in regards to the reason this world is in the state which it is in. In my opinion, the oaths and secret combinat ions are the basis for t hat which is fanatical, control oriented and destructive. The secretive vows are one of the biggest reasons that society has degraded. Supposed truth should be given to all for open debate. It is in this way, evolution is enhanced instead of i nhibited. The secret societies strive to acquire information, technology, etc., and then hoard it for themselves. They then systematically destroy all public remnants of it, so they can keep it exclusive. This is a major problem for the world; it's like the Christians burning the libraries of the east all over again (after pillaging what they wanted) in an attempt to erase the knowledge (and history) from the public domain forever. This secrecy is an abomination that makes the rest of the world desolate. Just as in the case of religion, where the revealing of the truth would relin quish the churches (and their au thorities) of their power over people, so too would the governments and secret societies lose their power, were the truth to be revealed, and those formerly oppressed humans wo uld not take it lightly that their lives have been manipulated through the false morals and dogma of Fascism."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" Figure 16.

It is this teaching, which must strip away that which is in conflict with the natural indigenous makeup of the individuals seeker's belief system. Tuning the mind towards the higher frequency vibrations, which must be attuned to, in order to conquer death on a Spiritual (which is also physical) level. When the physical body dies, the Spirit is thought to wake, if the hero is able to make this happen. This is the practice of Shamanism, the journey into the death experience, the deep psychological introspection/judgment through plant induced states, in preparation for the inevit ability of the ultimate event, the crowning glory of life itse lf, death. This is at the forefront of the Shamanic practice, rather than a quest relegated to the deity one worships. It resides at the core of individual experience. One experiences heaven and hell, and all points in-between. The hell being mostly experienced as one recognizes, and then rejects (sometimes kicking and screaming) the deceptions accepted into one's cosmological belief system. Especially where these beliefs are deeply imbedded through years of societal conditioning, and are in direct contradict ion with that indigenous spiritual nature of man. They become a second nature thought process, of which everything \"one believes\" relies upon, as the self manifested, yet culturally conditioned, as t heir foundation of existence. Much of the conflict between culturally imbedded belief and the naturally experienced indigenous nature of humanity revolves around sexuality. Freud was adamant in his thesis, wherein society must suppress, repress and fully renounce the instinctual drives in order fo r cultural advancement (this is recognition of the motivation behind patriarchal systems). According to Wilhelm Reich: \"Freud's basic idea is that cultural achievements result from sublimated sexu al energy, indicating that sexual suppression, or repression, is an indispensable factor in establis hing any culture. Now there is already historical proof that this concept is erroneous, for ther e are highly cultured societies in which sexual suppression is non-existent and whose members enjo y completely free sexual lives. Thus is the nature of indigenous societies. It was precisely my a ttempts at a sex-political criticism of culture that gave weight to our very first differences of opin ion.\" (Italics mine) Wilhelm Reich was talking about this very oppression of humanity's indigenous and natural spirituality, through an attack on individual freedom at its root source, sexuality. Freud's concept is a simple description of Patriarchal, sex- negative, entheogen denying, religious systems. That philosophy which is carried forward, and enforced by governmental regulation. A clear separat ion of church and state certainly must excise any attempt toward governmental sexual regulation, outside the scope of rape. And the same must not regulate the ingestion of plant entheogens, which ar e spiritual in nature. It is the very nature of the established religious/political bond that perpetuates the sex-ne gative, consciousness repressive society. This repression of mind and body, enforc ed by religious/governmental genocide, of all who resist their attempts at conversion, is exactly that life-force in human beings which is crying out from the past for retribution and reestablishment as the tr ue spiritual human nature exiled. It is also always the quest of the hero to free friends, family and the world from an oppressive damaging tyrant or government. Of course one must first recognize that the tyranny exists, and why. This is the quest that must be carried on, and it should not be taken lightly. It is not an easy task, ever. Yet it is the quest of every human incarnated. The degree to which one accepts the task is oftentimes determined by how much a person is aware of thei r surroundings, the repressive nature of their environment, and whether or not they possess, and are no t afraid to express, a sincere desire to do something about it. It is the very deep conditioni ng, and abstract yet convincing supposed logic, that holds grip upon most of the culturally initiated, in order to keep them in tow, as faithful servants of that very nature which creates spiritual conflict, and forces beings into reincarnation. Spiritual Death is that which consumes those who are not in contact with indigenous spirituality (which incorporates full individual freedom) but choose, consciously or unconsciously, to be the repressed and the repressors. Wilhelm Reich was imprisoned, died mysteriously thereafter, and his books confiscated and burned in the incinerators in New York by the F.D.A., in an attempt to stamp out once again the uprising of the indigenous natural spirituality of humanity, as it tries to break free of the corporate/religio-governmenta lly enforced repression. Shamanism affords one the opportunity to expe rience these death and rebirth experiences, as practice for conquering actual death, as well as to receive the indigenous teaching that can be passed on to those interested in doing the same. That this indigenous teaching recognizes the repression of the human soul, on a global level, should not be surprising. Each individual knows within themselves the natural path, and is woun ded spiritually through pa st life experiences of repression. This is imbedded into the psyche, and manifests as a fear of those authority figures pushing this repression, or a fear of challenging t hem. It is amazing the resistance an individual can muster to a reshaping of their belief system. Fierce ly humans hold to their beliefs, rejecting anything that challenges their paradigm. Ev en to the point of becoming themse lves the enforcers of their own oppression. This is exactly that process which one g oes through at death. The inability to let go of repressive belief is the conflict that forces death and rebirth, holding one within the revolving door of incarnation which the indigenous Shaman, writer s of the Hindu Vedas, call Samsara (the wheel of life). So Shamanism does operate on an individual basis. The teachings are in direct opposition to those societal, religious and political norms. The industrial revolution, high technology, and the established"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"patriarchal systems of Society have consciously attempted to stamp out the indigenous natural cultures of the planet, under the guise of civilizing the savage man. I for one am not buying it. If there is to be some type of rebirth of the planet, globa l enlightenment, an entry into a golden age, it must be centered on the true nature of m ankind, and not a rehashing of the same old fake status quo. There will never be a global awakening which reve als everything religion has taught us about sin, guilt and repression of natural desires was right all along. The worse case scenario is this oppressive religio-governmental society gains more and more control and ability to enforce their beliefs on more individuals. A literal hell-on-earth is the end result. This will continue this si tuation, where that true indigenous spirituality cries from the deepest rece sses of each of our souls, and the over-soul of humanity itself, to be set free, and we owe it to futu re generations not to let this happen to them. The Amanita muscaria is the cornerstone of S hamanism, producing the quintessential death and rebirth experience. Despite the fa ct that Shamanism, by nature, re jects the yokes of patriarchal religion, Shamanism is the cornerstone of all Religions. Yet religion, as we have it today, by its very nature, has completely lost the natural indigeno us freedom it professes to impart, the Natural Indigenous spiritual awakening for each individual by the plant of immortality, the most ancient of all spiritual traditions. In fact the key to the indivi dual's quest for immortality. This event is also the awakening of the Spiritual being, which, although pr ofessed by most religious organizations, has an actuality that is seldom realized. Even Shamanism, in its various forms, is certainly not without its patriarchal sub-groups, and sex-negat ive branches, all things can be polluted, and in this world it seems that anytime something good rises to the surf ace, the desire of man to gain control and power winds up ruining it.
