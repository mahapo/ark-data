The quest for this ex- perience and the awareness of its implications is far more highly EDITORIAL developedin the East than in the West; hence the program has often been stated in terms of unifying the Eastern and Western approaches. The age - old issue of freedom vers a s control has entered a new Discerning men have stressed over and over that we have much to stage in our era.

In the lives and work of artists and writers and in the aesthetic sphere in general, visionary experience has often played a significant role. In the 1 9 th Century French Symbolist movement, for example, the consumption of hashish was pervasive and influential. Many in- dividual artists from Thomas De Quincey to William Burroughs have used drugs in one way or another to shape their creative vision. Studies of the associations between drugs and creativity are antici- pated. The classical literature describing the interior journey will be discussed and reviewed.

If he will not , the experience remains a beautiful anomaly, a gradu- ally fading wonder -- fading because it has no relevance to \"the life of quiet desperation\" which Thoreau saw most of us living and which we cannot help but live. What, then, should be done about it? LSD is certainly one of the least toxic chemicals man has ever put inside his system. Com- pared with alcohol , nicotine , coffee -- our three great stand-bys -- it could be called almost a docile mare as against these mettlesome stal- lions, so far as most people are concerned. Is it of any use with psychotics? Most researchers doubt it. With the extreme neurotic? Again there seems to be considerable question.

Those of you who do not kno w the story will be interested in learning how it came about that my wife , who was a pediatrician, and I , who am a banker, took up the study of mushrooms. She was a Great Russian and , like all of her fellow-countrymen, learned at her mother's knee a solid body of empirical knowledge about the common species and a love of them that are astonishing to us Am e r - icans. Like us, the Russians are fond of nature -- the forests and birds and wild flowers. But their love of mushrooms is of a different order , a visceral urge , a passion that passeth understanding. The worthless kinds, the poisonous mushrooms -- the Russian s are fond, in a way , even of them. They call these \"worthles s ones\" p aganki, the \"little pagans , \" and my wife would make of them colorful center- pieces for the dining-room table, against a background of moss and stones and wood picked up in the woods. On the other hand, I , of Anglo-Saxon origin, had known nothing of mushrooms. B y in- heritance, I ignored them all; I rejected those repugnant fungal growths, expressions of parasitism and decay.

The disposition to do thi s lies in their nature, the process itself was sensual and conscious. Similar phenomena are reported about ti l e North American Indian s : The \"Great Ni g htsong\" is one of their principal ceremonies, where the men hold one another, move rhythmically and go into a trance. Closeness to intoxication is evidently a primitive quality as is the transition to a collectively heightened sense of being. The assembly provokes the transition through rites, movements , and c ertain ancient chants. It is a call of the race.

You can d o it only to o utside it, neither one bein g prior to the other, but equals, like the disc o v e r you canno t d o it . f r o n t and back of a coi n . I commend these observations to you simply to show how a scientific thinker who s e whole stance is in the direction of mechanism, of re g arding the human being as a kind of biological puppet, must b e for c ed by the logic of his own thinking to concl u sions of a rather different kind. He states these questions in veiled language, so that neither he nor his colleagues will see their disastrously unrespectable implications ! Suppose , then, it becomes possible for us to have a new sense of the individual , that we all become conscious of ourselves as organism-environment fields, vividly aware of the fact that when we move, it is not simply my self moving inside my skin, exercising energy upon my limbs , but also that in some marvelous way the physical continuum in which I move is also moving me. The very fact that I am here in this room at all is because you are here. It was a common concurrence, a whole concatenation of circumstances which go together, each reciprocally related to ail. Would such an awareness be significant? Would it add to our knowledge ? Would it change anythin g , make any difference ? Seriously, I think it would; because it makes an enormous difference whenever what had seemed to be partial and distintegrated fits into a larger integrated pattern. It will of course be impossible finally to answer the question, \"Why does that satisfy us ? , \"because to answer this question exhaustively I would have to be able to chew my own teeth to pieces. In the pursuit of scientific knowledge, always watch out f or that sna g . You will never get to the irreducible explanation of an y thing becau s e you will never be able to explain why you want to explain, and so on. The system will gobble itself up.

Solms (1958), comparing LSD (lysergic acid cats similar to those p roduced by large doses of LSD. t diethylamide), LAE (lysergic acid ethylamide) and LA (lysergic acid ami&), I concluded that the hallucinogenic effect increased with the number of ethyl ( 2 ) L y se r gicacid derivatives ( s ee Fig. 2 ) i groups at the amide-N, and that drowsiness and lethargy increased as the Figure 2 number of ethyl groups decreased, LA producing most drowsiness. (4) The O temlc_l Structure of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide .and Related Compounds greatest reduction in mental effects was caused by changes in p osition 2 of the O indole ring.
