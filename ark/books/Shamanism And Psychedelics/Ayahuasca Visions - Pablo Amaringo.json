A plant may not talk, but there is a spirit in it that is conscious, that sees everything, which is the soul of the plant, its essence, what makes it alive. The channels through which the water & sap move are the veins of the spirit."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"PART I: PLANT-TEACHERS AND SHAMANIC POWERS VISION 1 PREPARATION OF AYAHUASCA Here we see the jungle of the Ucayali with its native trees, bushes, plants, herbs, and underbrush. There, a peasant type of house, with its roof of shebon leaves [Scheelea sp.], its fork-shaped props of incira tree [Chiorophora tinctoria], its floor of ponas [iriartea exorrhiza, Socratea sp., and a hammock in the centre. We see a certain riverside vegetalista who for many years has been dedicated to obtaining knowledge through ayahuasca. He begins by cutting an ayahuasca liana that is climbing up a capirona tree [Calycophyllum spruceanum]. To do just this, the vegetalista had to follow a required discipline. He has not been with his wife for three days. He has had no contact with ill-tempered or bad-living people. He has eaten no salty, sweet, or bitter food. He has not gotten drunk. He is clean, according to the requirements of this purge.He gets up early in the morning and goes to take an ayahuasca rope or liana. He goes out with his cigarette, taking with him his tobacco. He puts at the foot of the ayahuasca plant an offering of tobacco, matches, and some dry leaves of the heart of the banana tree in the manner of paper to wrap the tobacco. Then he says to the grandfather [the ayahuasca spirit]: \"Here I put your tobacco for you, your matches, your banana leaf for you to wrap your tobacco. I ask you, grandfather; to permit me to take your plant for medicine, not to cause any harm to anybody, but to cure sick people. Then the vegetalista observes the chicua [Piaya cayana], a bird that is always flying about. We can see it up on the far left side of the painting, and also in another tree close to the capirona, at the right. If this bird says \"chis, chis,\" it is good to take the vine. But if the animal says"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"chicua,\" then it must not be taken. The vegetalista just has to leave it for another day, because there can be danger, the enemy can attack him, he can be killed, or something else can happen. If the animal says ~~chis, chis, chicua,\" it means that at first things will go well, but afterwards they will go wrong. Perhaps he will not be able to cure the sick person as desired.After obtaining the ayahuasca, the vegetulista cuts it into pieces, makes it into a roll, and takes it to his house. There he cuts it into smaller pieces and starts to crush and boil them. After boiling for three or four hours, he pours the juice into other pots. He continues to crush and to put new pieces of the vine into the now empty pot, and again boils it. He goes on like this. He always has three or four pots very full, taking out the juice of the ayahuasca. Then he adds fresh ayahuasc a. The vegetalista puts in the chacruna that he has taken in the morning while fasting. First he puts the ayahuasca in the pot, whistles an icaro ~ power song, and blows on the pot. Then he adds the chacruna, putting the side which has received sun downwards with the \"spurs\" upwards. Then he puts another layer of crushed ayahuasca on it, the twelve to fifteen pieces he has ground. He again takes two handfuls of chacruna leaves and pours water on them, filling the pot to the top. In order for the purge to be effective, the pot must be made of clay, not aluminium or other material. The vegetalista adds a handful of tobacco to make the mixture boil, and any other ingredient he may usually add when he prepares the ayahuasca purge. He can add two leaves of toe [Brugmansia sp.], or also two pieces of ground motelo huasca [Bauhinia guianensis], or he may try the chicuro [Cyperus sp. with the shillinto [Mascagnia psilophylla], with the puka-lupuna [Cavanillesia hylogeiton, C. umbellata], or with the clavohuasca. But it is not always good to mix in so many things. It's better to make it each time with the chacruna and, if he so wishes, he may add another plant, always one at a time. He is in a solitary place"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"where nobody will look at the pot, which must not be seen by anybody. For this reason, the vegetalista must choose a small village or an isolated place where nobody will arrive and where no-body will speak to him. He doesn't have his wife, he doesn't have a helper, he doesn't have anybody with him. This is because this purge is unlucky when it is not prepared correctly. It does not give positive results, because the mothers or spirits of the vegetation do not come to help in the preparation of this purge. It does not suffice to cook the vine. One must also have some spiritual contact to give one strength; one's way of being must be appropriate because we are influenced by spiritual beings. Even though they are not seen, it is true they exist. They are the ones that have taken over these plants. They are the conservers, they take care of the plants. This is why they don't give visions to persons who don't comply with all the requirements of this so-called ciencia vegetalista, which in the old days was known as aiquimia pah'stica [plant alchemy]. You can only become a good vegetalista by keeping a diet or fasting for years, then you become one that knows the science of the muraya, of the sumi, and of the banco, which are the three highest degrees in the traditional vegetalista medicine in the Amazon. Here we see the vegetalista with his dog, like a guardian in physical form to keep away other animals or persons. But the dog also has a spiritual vision; he can see in a spiritual way that an enemy is coming closer and can hurt his master. Then the dog wakes up and wakes his master. Even though the vegetalista puts on his arkanas [defences] , he doesn't have enough sensibility to perceive the enemy from miles away. But the dog does, because he can see so many things, so many spirits in different ways. The dog also has something mystical, magical, and spiritual. For this reason, the vegetalista must always have a dog."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"VISION 2 ORIGIN OF AYAHUASCA This is what I saw in a vision that nearly killed me. I can attest that among the most remote tribes of Peru, there is one called Shins, of great warriors. Among them there was a king called Sinchihuyacui, who after being defeated by another tribe went full of sorrow to a garden where he had planted various trees. There he died, and was buried near them."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Some years later he appeared in a dream to his wife, Queen Ganmacuina, and asked her to go to his grave with some of her princesses, taking with her his shield, his spear, his bronze war club and sling, the gourd from which he used to drink, and his chicha [maize beer] vessel. He would then give her some instructions relating to the plant that had grown ( grave. The queen did as indicated, and when she was jug her husband's weapons near his grave she saw in great terror that he emerged from the grave with his body shining and radiating light, wielding a golden war club in his hands. The queen and her companions dropped down horrified, facing the ground, incapable of looking directly at the king. One of them began to scream:,\" runa!! Reimi!!! Ayaruna!!!!\" The king said, \"Don't be afraid, sumac huar tas. Listen to my words, so that in the future youâ€™re able to be in contact with me. I died sad and bitter due to a defeat I was not able to foresee. Whenever you wish you may receive good advice and know] about other worlds. I made a plant grow out C hair.

This [mythological] hairy ray is very much feared because of its size -30 to 40 meters in circumference.

The effect on the nervous system is felt in the tip of the toes and fingers, in the ears, lips, eyes, and nose. This is why those parts are red. The combined effect of these plants is esoteric: due to their supernatural properties, psychic bodies are created that the eyes have never perceived before, so that one is overwhelmed by this strange new dimension. This world penetrates the top of the head so that the aura stimulates a gland between the eyebrows. At the top left we see a bird called rompe-mortajas [an owl] that has been transformed from a tobacco leaf Below we see a great queen with a golden sceptre. Her name is Mariquita Toe'. She is a doctor with great knowledge. Below her is the legendary fairy Quetfael, who knows about medicine and paranormal beauty. Behind the chacruna serpent we see the great sylph Resfenel, the guardian of several constellations. We see him here surrounded by meteors and bright sapphires which illuminate his clothes. To the right we see the great gardener with a golden stick and a pipe shaped like a snake. This being has the rank ofsatrapa pito'nico,~ and always cares for the ayahuasca plant. The cricket we see near him cries in alarm when anybody cuts a piece of this plant without first making an offering.

The king holds a sceptre of death and will bring down its power upon anyone who has not followed the strict dietary regime that ingesting this plant requires. This plant's cathartic medicine facilitates the knowledge of magical esoteric sciences. The tree in front of him is the puka-lupuna tree [Cavanillesia hylogeiton], also known as lupuna cobrada [red lupuna]. This tree's mother-spirit is a woman of dark complexion with cat eyes and a gold chain around her neck. She is very useful to sorcerers who do evil things. The knowledge that this princess bestows is almost always turned towards sorcery and very seldom towards curanderos that heal and save lives. This tree also demands a strict and rigorous diet, and im mediate death awaits the unprepared. The third tree is the ajosquiro [Gallizia corazema]. Its spirit is a very small curly haired man, wearing a red cape and red clothes. Few people ingest this plant, for the diet it requires is very rigid and severe. This is symbolised by the alicomachines, a group of ferocious monkeys who hang by their tails and jump wildly. This medicine is used as a defence against enemies.

These songs are meant to calm the sorrow-filled heart of an estranged lover and help him to forget the lost loved one. In front of the renaquilla is the yahuar-toro [blood bull] who nourishes itself upon the yahuar-piripiri [Eleutherine bulbosa]. The icaro of this animal and plant serves as a cure for those who are suffering malaire [illness produced by an evil breeze, see footnote to Vision 6] or have been harmed by the ayanahui [from aya = dead person, and nahui = eye; firefly] or other malevolent beings like the Chullachaki [forest spirit] or the Maligno [an evil spirit].

In front of the ajosquiro tree is the caballo piripiri ~iripifl horse] [Cyperus sp.]. Whoever ingests this plant acquires great strength. It is prepared in a mixture with jagua or huito [Genipa americana]. The jagua is mixed in careful, exact proportions with the piripiri, and in the morning it is poured over the entire body. One then avoids the sun, salt, sweets, garlic, liquor, and pig fat for eight days, while also abstaining from sex and socializing with anyone who is sexually active.

There is not a person without something to tell the others~for example, episodes in which they have been healed, or the plants they have taken for certain illnesses, and so on. The vegetalista advises them about the kind of food they should eat and the other prescriptions required when ingesting ayahuasca. To the right the vegetalista Vicente Silvano is giving ayahuasca to a young man. He first sings an icaro to give strength to the brew, so that the young man will have beautiful and wise visions. When the person receives the gourd with the brew, before drinking it he must pray to the ayahuasca in more or less these terms: â€œGrandfather, please, let me see all those things I want to see.\" The wish may be to see a distant dear relative, or to find something lost, or the solution to a specific problem. \"Please, grandfather, let me see what is the illness that is bothering me, what enemies I have, what is to become of my life.\" The vegetalista indicates to the young man where he had placed his mouth when blowing and singing on the ayahuasca gourd, because it is from this spot that he must drink the ayahuasca. When the people have taken the brew, they go to the room in the centre of the house to wait for the visions to come. People should sit in a ritual order, not just in any position. It is about nine or ten in the night, when there is complete silence.

This means that a sorcerer may try to harm him. If the contractions are in his right arm, that means that he is going to see all that he asked of the ayahuasca spirit. After some time, if the vegetalista is Catholic, Protestant, or of any other religion, he will begin with a prayer asking Jesus or any other divinity for assistance, depending on his beliefs, so that nothing evil will happen.

Among them are the black yakurunas, the yana-sirenas [black mer maids], the black boa, the sarara [Anhinga anhinga], the black rainbow, the yana- mono [black ape], the yana-tibe [black aquatic bird], etc. The uppermost pipe is made of the tahuari plant [Tabebuja sp.], whose spirit is both a human and a black bull. Below this pipe is the face of a giant. As the smoke rises from the tobacco, the yura-cukchas mailcas [the old snowy-haired wise ones] are released. They are renowned doctors who can perform miracle cures. The other person seen below the pipe is a talabat, a king of great stature who has a facial mole that extends from his upper lip to his hairline. The pipe just below and to the right is made of the huacamayo-caspi tree [Coutarea hexandra, Sickingia tinctoria], and its spirit is the prince called Yana- huya [black face]. From the pipe rise the curikiros [golden teeth] and the forest nymph that accompanies them. The next pipe is made of the shihuahuaco tree [Dipteryx sp.]. Its spirit is the serpent with the human face known as machaco-runa [the snake people]. The beings released from the pipe are the maya-machaco [snake ancestors] and the sylph called Pichamui shipash [the maiden that cleans], who belongs to the tobacco flower."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" The pipe on the bottom is of the cumaceba tree [Cesalpina equinata]. From this pipe arise majestic lords called ampishcashamuy [those who come to cure] and their guardian, the serpent tamer called Alli Urman.

Directly in front of him is a violet palm and its spirit, the forest nymph Churay Allinushki [pouring forth of sweet smells or perfumes]. In the upper right corner we see the flowers of the sanango with their spirit queens sitting upon them like thrones. The queens possess the gift of expelling the cold, using this powerful curative plant as a medium To the left of the uppermost queen we see the cherub Fedikel, a celestial spirit who is showing the movements of rotation and translation of Planet Earth.

The vegetalista shown here to the left is a Shipibo shaman. He is a ehontero, a sorcerer who inflicts harm with his chontas or virotes, darts he makes from the thorns of various plants and trees, from the beak of certain birds, the fangs of snakes, or the hair of the casha-cushillo [porcupine, Coendu bicolor]."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"When a chontero wants to cause harm, he. takes one of his chontas from his mann and blows towards his victim-here we see how a man is hit with a chon ta in his right arm. If previous to the attack the body of the victim has been properly treated by a good vegetalista, he will immediately feel that he has been hurt and will seek rapid remedy. If his body has not been treated, the victim might go around with great pain, ignorant of the cause of his misfortune, and he may even die. In the center is a Cocama sorcerer.\" His evil wisdom encompasses the manipulation of marupas, or animals-insects, snakes, scorpions, bats, rays, toads, etc.-which he keeps in his mann [magical phlegm] and which he sends to cause harm. This technique is called hechicerfa marupa [marupa sorcery]. We see here how a woman is bitten by a snake sent by the Cocama sorcerer, who in his visions had already planned how he was to proceed. The victim feels the urge to go to a certain place, where the animal of the sorcerer will attack him or her. To the right is a sorcerer who has the huani as his weapon of harm. The huani is a steel bow with a crystal arrow. He keeps the huan( under his left armpit. Inside his mann he carries a living piranha. A sorcerer wearing a red shirt is here putting the bow in his mouth and blowing the crystal arrow, which pierces the body of the victim and returns to the armpit of the sorcerer. The victim feels very tired; he will go to sleep. When he wakes up he will begin to vomit blood until he dies. No vegetalista can cure this kind of sorcery. Only God can save him. There are in this painting several plants. To the left of the Shipibo chontero is a marannara [unidentified], a plant used by sorcerers. Above is a tree called tungara [unidentified].

The snakes used by the sorcerers are, from left to right: the yana-machaco, nacanaca [Micrurus sp.], urillo, tinga, paiche machacuy, tahuampa shushupi [Lachesis muta], jergtin [Bothrops atrox], and iguana machacuy [Sp j/O tes pu/la tus]. A curandero is able to distinguish the type of sorcery his patient is suffering from by ingesting ayahuasca and observing the type of lights surrounding his patient.

Beyond them are the bufeos [dolphins] who turn into human beings in order to seduce and have sexual intercourse with women to make children that will later serve them. In the river, amidst the big waves, we can see a great Yakumama, who sometimes becomes a steamboat. On top of her-with sparkling rays of fire emanating from his head-is the sum iruna, a man capable of entering the water as if it were the easiest thing in the world. Behind him sits a muraya, who dominates through perfume and who is of great spiritual power. Behind him is a banco with sublime powers who has a flying wheel and a diamond sword for weapons. Next there is a strong and fast witch, armed with a flying bow and arrow. Behind her are mermaids who understand medicine well.

It's like a Bacchanalian feast to which all wild animals are invited so they together with their masters will entertain all the rest, setting up a circus show with dances, music with euphoric rhythm, and entrancing singing. There you can hear the most complex sounds and lullabies of the purity of the forest, of the intricate web of the vegetal esoteric world.

He wears skins of the boa, trousers of ray-fish with feet of yangunturo [giant armadillo], and his hat is a macaw called yura-guacamayo. Two acorones or giant boas open their mouths to let the animals and yakurunas used by vegetalistas give their farewells to the great sumiruna. White mermaids make the capsule levitate. Flying saucers hurry to receive it, and to accompany it in its astral travel. At the lower left we see some expert curanderos swallowing various virotes with their mann. He who sits on a tortoise is a banco, and he swallows the virotes of the inchahui palm tree [Syagrus tessmannii], which is seen nearest the riverside. He who smokes his cachimba [pipej has swallowed the virotes made of pona [!riartea exorrhiza], the palm tree with long roots. The third vegetalista swallows the virotes made of the inayuga [Maximiliana stenocarpa], the thicker palm seen further away; while the last one takes the virotes made of the huasai palm [Euterpe precatoria], seen in front. Behind the inayuga is a cumaceba tree [Cesalpina equinata], the motelo huasca vine [Bauhinia guianensis], the sacha-ajos [Mansoa alliacea] and other plants.

In these places there are huge renacales. One walks several days finding only this plant. My grandfather told me this story, which took place during the period in which many caucheros [rubber tappers] came to this area to establish their camps. It happened that eight people went hunting and decided to spend the night near a cocha [lake]. They all put their mosquito nets near the shore of the lake, except one of them, who preferred to sleep in his hammock. At midnight a full moon could be seen on the horizon. One of the people woke up and noticed that the man sleeping in his hammock was moaning. Then he saw a huge sanguijuela mama [a leech], about twelve meters long, with four antennae in its head and no mouth. He screamed but there was no reaction from anybody; all seemed to be in a deep sleep. Because he knew that sometimes the yana-puma [black jaguar], the Sachamama, and other animals have the power to make people sleep in order to devour them, he ran to the forest. The next morning he went back to the camp and found all his comrades dead, without a single drop of blood in their bodies. The sanguijuela mama had drawn all the blood from their bodies with the electromagnetic waves emanating from its head. I thought that this was only a story, but with ayahuasca I was able to see this animal and became convinced of its existence, as well as that of many other animals believed to be only mythological.

My father took me to a settlement called Brazil. In a house on one end of town lived a woman called Maria Pacaya. My father had to cure several patients, and there he took ayahuasca. He also gave me the brew after blowing on it with the purpose of helping me, as I was suffering from a heart disease. The brew was so strong that I was at the edge of screaming. The visions were so vivid that I thought what I saw was not just imagination, but a contact with something physical and real. I saw sphinxes; I was in Africa, Europe, and the Americas; suddenly I saw a doctor dressed in a grey- violet suit. He was an American. His wife was wearing an emerald-green dress. Their daughter had a dress of the same color. They seemed to be nurses, and had with them scalpels, scissors, pincers, hooks, cotton, needles and thread, and medicine of various kinds.The doctor asked me to take off my shirt. He took a large, broad knife and opened me from the clavicle to the last rib of the left side. With a hammer he broke the ribs and opened my chest. He put my heart on a dish, where he operated on its arteries and joined them with some sort of soft plastic tubes.

When the queen approaches an ayahuasca session, the visions take on a purplish color. If there is someone taking ayahuasca as an initiation and his body isn't yet clean, he is likely to vomit a lot, sometimes even blood, in order to purify his body. A celebrated king of the Sakias, sitting in his imperial chair, reveres the great Kundal, as King Kundal is superior in occult powers. The other king is the guard of many Gnostic pagodas. At his side is seen the great spirit of Shiva as a skull, representing the death or destruction of the physical body as one is absorbed by magnetic powers from beyond the grave, which destroy the natural aura and convert it into a dissipating aura, thus effecting death. In front we see a big serpent, coloured lilac, an animal from the garden of Queen Samhadi. It is the arkana of the master curandero. It has strong vibrations and is even able to rob the mann from the Curandero's breast, leaving him without powers. In front of this serpent is the angash-machohualipa [brave blue cock], which appears when an initiate breaks the rigorous diet necessary to become an efficient vegetalis ta, since the meat of a hen is very bad when on a diet. If a sick person who has been treated with icaros and blows by a curandero eats hen's meat, the sickness returns with a greater force and he may even die if not treated in time. In the back one can see the Chai Cuilkimama [the mother of the silver], called so because she spreads white silver plates. Her icaro is chanted to help a person prosper in business, and so become rich. Her chant also cures the mal aire de difunto [illness produced by the spirit of a deceased person]. In the front we see two women called Millaipa-huarmi [ugly woman]. These women perform a great task in the curanderismo, since they gather the sickness that the curandero extracts from the patient. The younger one, dressed in sky-blue, picks up the sickness and"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"contains it in her hands. If the patient does not diet, she returns the sickness, as she hasn't enough power to hold back the evil spell, and the sick one gets worse again. But if the patient cooperates with the master curandero and diets, this woman places the evil spell in the lap of the aged woman, dressed in lilac, who makes it disappear inside the whirlwind of her large dress, and the evil spell returns no more. On the house we see a strange serpent called Sacramachaco [bad snake]. This animal has the head of a deer, with horns and large ears. It is called upon to strengthen the mareacion with its magnetic arc, which surrounds the house, and to see the different mariris as well, which contain the various things and animals used by the witch. Near the animal is the puka-urcutucu [red owl], with eyes of fire, who guards the shamans while they are curing. More to the left we see the eminent pythonic king called Todh, adviser to the great sumis. He goes round and round the house, while the shamans and their companions are dizzy with the purge. As a guardian, he carries a fiymg torch to shield or protect the Amazonian shamans, the ones that still possess this precious knowledge of the curing techniques of their ancestors. Overhead is the great sylph called ma, with a tuft of coloured feathers that radiates mystic messages of en chanting songs or icaros, which cure quickly and precisely. This sylph has the power to open the mariris, which appear like vibrant tubes from which one can see different types of sorcery emerging. From the first tube comes a bow with an arrow, called yachay-huani', which is used by the sorcerers and healers. From the second one comes the white mann, which is medicinal. From the third comes a yachaytrueno ~achay = magical phlegm; trueno = thunder], used by the true sorcerers. From the fourth comes a snake or the Sachamama, also used by sorcerers, a mann belonging to marupa sorcery [see Vision 8]. The fifth mann also belongs to marupa sorcery, since it is influenced by animals. It is used by sorcerers as well as healers to convey"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"messages. There are the tibe negro, the sarara [Anhinga anhinga], the suisui [Thraupis episcop us], and the tuquituqui [Jacana spinosa].

From the last mann come the virotes that belong to chonta sorcery, since they are needles prepared from palm trees and thorns of certain sticks, horns of certain fish, teeth of certain snakes, as well as beaks of certain birds. Behind these powers or mariris we see the yuraamp ishca huarmi [white healing woman], also called Sidaga, because she brings great power to the mann that cures. She presides from an esoteric town called La Gran Marat, home of those belonging to the dynasty of the great wise masters of the esoteric arts and other parapsychological sciences. In front of the city we see a flying object that approaches the house where ayahuasca is taken. It comes from the planet Mars, and in it come goblins, experts in surgical operations. They come from the area of the impenetrable craters. The master vegetalista receives them, as a sign of appreciation, with the panga-cometas [comets of living leaves], which then change into flying animals. Slightly to the left, we see two volcanoes from where the giant Krishne or Krishni comes, with his serpent Shucakun [whistling or whistler]. This being is malevolent. It appears only to persecute the good shamans or fairies who come to cure, and it is very much usedby the sorcerers and witches.

Further down, we see another extraterrestrial ship, which comes from the galaxy Antares with beings of elastic body who do not walk upon the ground, as they have strong levitation powers which can suspend even the heaviest body. Down by the river is seen the great prince VilkaAuca [soldier of the family] on his black bull, with two golden swords and a luminous tuft of feathers, which radiates immense aquatic powers. He is a helper when one walks under the water and a companion in maritime travel. A little to the left are the pumas-sirenas, with the body and hair of a woman but the face of a tiger, with very hypnotic tails. They are used by the murayas to catch the bufeos colorados [pink river dolphins] who sometimes rob women and make them pregnant.

He tried to cure her, without success. But I was able to cure her by means of the icaro del kapukiri and the leaves of catahua negra [Hura crepitans]. Kapukiri is almost like a dark brown vapor that rises and collects in the atmosphere. In archaic Quichua, kin is that which stinks, that which is rotten. Kapu means substance, lime. So kapukiri is something that has decomposed from a living thing in order to give strength to other lives. In the same way that fairies get their nourishment from perfumes, there are beings which inhale these substances. Evil shamans use the kapukiri to bring harm, and if one doesn't know its icaro, the patient will not heal. There are several kinds of kapukiri. When it is produced by the puka-/upuna [red lupuna, Cavanillesia sp.], the first tree to the left in this painting, the person feels as if his head grows larger, and feels a smarting all over his body [see Visions 4, 5, 21, 34]. The illness is most often located in the stomach. If the patient is a pregnant woman, the new-born baby looks rachitic. If it is produced by ajosquiro [Gallizia corazema], the second tree, the person becomes very nervous, afraid, and feels as if a worm was biting him.When it is produced by the catahua negra, the third tree, the patient feels that his mouth is very dry and his lips are cracked. The nerves contract, and the person shrinks. It produces fever; and the person develops something of a stutter. The kapukiri produced by the huairacaspi [Carpotroche grandiflora], the tree to the right, is the most frightening. The person feels as if he is walking in slow motion, as if in the air. It generates pain in the ears, and the skin turns grey, as if burned. It acts quickly, and the persons dies after three to five days, with heavy vomiting. These trees have a sublime function in esoteric shamanism. The puka-lupuna, for example, is a great magician that developed in other dimensions and came to"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"possess this tree. All these trees are very rigid regarding their cleanliness, and they punish those persons that mock them. One should not urinate nor defecate on their leaves. One should not use their leaves as paper to clean oneself. One should not play with the leaves, nor cut these trees for the mere sake of it, nor should one use them as lumber. These trees are generating substances that other beings use as their nourishment. If one urinates and defecates on the tree, the tree will then emit something harmful to these beings. That is the reason they are very defensive. In the background we see cities, towers, monuments, and parks associated with the kapukiri. To the left we see huts where the great shamans of various tribes arrive in spirit, to be trained regarding the kapukiri. There one learns that a young man should not sleep in the bed of an old man. Native people, particularly the elderly, don't like anyone to touch what belongs to them. All that belongs to the shamans must be respected-the bed, the plates, etc. This is because a young man is full of filth. When one becomes old, one learns to be cleaner. The city in the centre symbolises the purity of a shaman when, already old, he goes to another stage. It is the purity that the person acquires through his death, when he leaves this life and is transported to another place. This is when a person has been ordained, when he has been requested. Not everyone goes there. I don't reject the Christian belief according to which Christ said to his disciples: \"Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards\" [John 13:36]. But this does not hold true for everyone. Christ said: \"In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you\" [John 14:2]. But this doesn't mean that this is for all humanity, but for certain chosen persons.

To the left, however; we see how a vegetalista is curing the disease by sucking it with the mann of his throat. To prevent any intrusion upon the circle where the healing is being performed, the doctors have raised strong tingunas of surprising colours and posted animals of prey, such as the yachaygavilanes [wise sparrow hawk], the tahuicuros [Monasa nigrifons] and the supay-unchalas [unchala = Aramides cajanea], as well as the push co-yuyo plant and the thorns of casha-huasca [thorny vine]. The master is also seen raising his magnetic powers in the form of yellow disks so that no microbe of this disease escapes. At top left, we see the worms of this disease reproduce. They suck blood and when having matured, shown below in the wheels of phlegm, they act as ticks that open wounds in the throat, thus preventing the victim from eating or drinking. At top right are the sorcerers sitting in their circle of sorcery, surrounded by the blue tingunas of the animals that maintain this disease. These are the congompe [snail], the callu-callu [leech], the macana [Gymnotus carapo, Apteronotus albifrons, and other species] and the shuyo [Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus], both fish with phlegm, and the ilausa-machaco [phlegm-snake] that with their phlegm all intensify the spell cast by the sorcerer.

Then the boa"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"places itself onto these clothes, excreting something living which later gives birth in the woman.The vegetalista sings his icaros to make the boa come out of the womb of the woman. Only the red boa is physical; the others accompany him, and they can be seen in the vision of the ayahuasca. The father of the boa is seen on the right, drawing very strongly with his magnet the white phlegm that is coming out in front of the red boa.To perform the treatment, the healer has taken a fruit from the jagua or huito [Genipa Americana] that can be seen top left. He has cut it in halves and scraped it a little, and he has prepared it with a little warm water in order for the pregnant woman to eat it. He prepares this remedy singing many icaros, blowing on it and putting in it arkanas, so as to give the boa's offspring reason to move. The vegetalista calls all his genies to help him successfully give force to this medicine. He calls the conmachaco that is a meandering serpent with golden disks on its skin, and on whom the vegetalista seems to rest during his trance. Through his icaro he also calls the rainbow with the whole range of colours that the boa yakumama has. He sings the icaro of the diamond, the gold, the silver, and of all the precious stones in order to put them on the woman to protect her in this way against the larvae the boa leaves in her body when exiting. He raises the mud of the waters, the huancahui [laughing falcon, Herpetotheres cachinnans], and the tigers that have astronger hypnotism than the boa, along with their trees the maniri- a magical tree that lives in the high jungles, with stripes similar to the tiger's-and the cab iniri, represented under the rainbow. The vegetalista sings also the icaros of the pucunucho [Capsicum s p.], chili of red fruits, and of the rocoto [Capsicum sp.], plants with which the vegetalista stuns the boa. On the right is the ayahuasca with its leaves full of ayanahuis [eyes of the dead] that represent the shaman's cigarette, and its flowers in the shape of snakes."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" On the right are the powers the boa has in order to give birth within the person. There we see the machaco-gacelas, women with snakes' bodies, and the mamatuas from the bottom of the river, the snakes taking care of the pregnancy of this boa. There is also Serasta, a snake with horns that lives in the high jungle on tree branches. The achiapu come to the aid of the vegetalista. They are princes with spears that destroy all the microbes contained in the phlegm of the boa, because if this is not done, the woman would die of vaginal hemorrhage. The spaceship behind her is seeing to it that the boa is not stronger than vegetalista and thus cannot harm him. It comes from a galaxy where there is a city called Aponia, where the people live in peace without knowing money, only love; where people don't fight against each other; but work in harmony. When the boa comes out, everybody falls into a very deep sleep because of the great hypnotism of the father of the boa, waiting at the riverside. Only the sublime vegetalista master remains awake, because he has electromagnetic powers. He is dressed in a gown to give power to his icaros, and on his head he has serpent- shaped flames. This is the kind of vegetalista who can cure efficiently. If this animal is not driven out by the knowledge of some vegetalista, it is certain the per son will die, because the snake will suck out all the blood."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"VISION 33 CAMPANA AYAHUASCA We see here a vegetalista cleansing the body of a person with certain impurities, for example saladera or mal aire, or who is contagious as a result of other people or the places he has been to, as humans are always gathering the influence of people and places.

One of the vegetalistas is curing a patient suffering from a malady of the stomach, by means of the spirits of ayahuman [Couroupita gujanensis, the cannon ball tree], whose heads are the fruits of the tree and bodies are twisted tingunas of various colours. These spirits help the vegetalista cure gastritis and stomach ache by extracting the illness with the power of their tongues. The tongues move in accord with the smoke the vegetalista is blowing on his patient. A queen comes to assist the vegetalista shaking his schacapa [rattle made of the leaves of Pariana sp.] over a patient. She is accompanied by the ladies under the bell, dancing to the music of the icaros. This queen has the machinruna [ape people] as her guardians, spirits found near the ayahuman, sometimes hidden in its branches. The armed beings with four faces usually live in subaquatic cities, enchanted cities located in huge caves beneath the sea. These beings give strength to the patient such that he is able towithstand the cure of the queen. These beings are like sylphs. They kindle lightning. The anguila mama is the boat they use. They are very powerful and use their swords to repel any attack or to save the lives of patients suffering from serious illness. They have four heads because they dominate the four poles of the earth. Their clothes are made of scales, because they are aquatic beings. We see that the patient is surrounded by an aura, and the impurities are coming out, some in the form of screaming spirits. To the right we see several boas, which represent the powers of ayahuasca. The"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"colours represent the living forces that make up the substance of this plant. We see a flying object coming from the North with blue beings from Venus.

They are oceanids that travel on top of a gigantic crab. They are mermaids, but not very beautiful, because their faces are like those of an ape. Further behind are several vacamarinas sirenas [manatee-mermaids], with fins instead of arms. The rest of their bodies are composed of snakes, and they move at great speed. On the beach we see a bufeo colorado [pink dolphin] coming out, riding on apuka-toro [red bull]. To its left we see a yakuruna and a simpi, a white being. Near the jungle there is a plant called puka-gramalote [unidentified], used by sorcerers to inflict nausea and headaches on their victims. In the centre is a spaceship that travels at great speeds, and to the right a great city surrounded by dancing queens. The city has a giant harp, called wakan harpa [harp that makes one cry]. Here live the great Radeles, the chiefs, and the Asaritas, their vessals. They all live in harmony. When one arrives in this city, he or she is invited to dance and eat.

Its genie or spirit is behind the plant, guarding his victim. The woman is in great pain. The vegetalista takes his mann out in the shape of white vipers that extract the thorns from the body of the woman. In the centre we see a very sick skinny man who was harmed by the supay- tt~yuyo that is guarding him. We see also a skinny and yellowish woman. Behind her is a tormenting spirit called asna-aya [stinking corpse], who is escorting his victim. Underneath there is a woman who looks as if she were pregnant but is not. She was harmed with the lupuna colorada [Cavallinesia sp.]. The genie of the tupuna is guarding her [see Visions 4, 5, 21, 30].

This woman was shaken by a bad tunchi [spirit of a deceased person], and the disciple is fanning her with leaves of achiote [Bixa orellana].Another vegetalista is blowing on a youth who was taken ill after having used the fat of a bufeo [dolphin] as a pusanga [a charm used for seducing a person of the opposite sex] without following the special method required. He lost his senses, but the healer sings the icaros of the bufeo colorado [pink dolphin], the patobufeo [duck-dolphin]-of which only the head is to be seen here-as well as the bufeo-sacha [unidentified], the plant seen in background with big green leaves. Behind it is the puka-cabra [red goat], which with its breath helps cure the youth of the disease. In the background we also see the pichana-machaco [a snake], which draws out the insanity by means of its electricity. On the left side of the snake we see the achote plant [Bixa orellana] with its fruit. This plant is indispensable in healing any kind of mal aire. In the centre is the punga tree [Bombax munguba], a plant that makes the mann stronger. On one of the branches we see a nest of wasps called bufro-avispa [dolphin-wasp], which are very daring, following us even into the water. Their venom brings on fever for days on end, which is why the healers use the icaro of this wasp to cure sorcery. Far to the right in the painting is a pot with ayahuasca and the gourd with which the brew is taken, as well as bottles of camphor and perfume.

On the head of the incorporated healer we see four rays of light. The lower ones belong to consciousness and the ones above to subconsciousness. The small waves that surround the head are vibrations of the senses that flow along the spinal cord. The brains are represented further up as an astral nucleus. The waves emanating from his hands are the power he receives from the purge of the ayahuasca. The helpers of the vegetalista are genies of ancient cultures. To the left is the great guru Le Muel Kan with his esoteric powers: he is of great spiritual tran scendence. Further up is the great pythonic Lui Ce Fu with his sparkling radiant power, smoking his visionary pipe that takes him to faraway places, where he gets to know different masters of the occult sciences.

In the centre is a vegetalista master in a yellow shirt and white pants, teaching and giving powers to his disciple, dressed in light-blue clothes. Their powers are seen as circles of light that vibrate beneath them. There are three temples. Those initiates who are going to be ordained ascend coloured steps to the first temple. Those descending have already been admitted, which is why a lilac-coloured horse with wings is coming from there. The initiated go to the second temple to graduate as masters with deeper esoteric knowledge. That's why we see a spaceship leaving. It symbolises the fact that they are now better protected. To the third temple with its light-blue stairs go those to be ordained as sublime masters, and they come down having been approved as worthy and respected masters of the esoteric sciences.

They are watching the flight of the great vegetalista or muraya on his tibemama bird. Two nautical nymphs accompany him as he goes after a patient whose soul is being taken by the guards of a sorcerer, leaving the body inert. But the vegetalista is curing him by summoning his powers, including the nina-caballo [horse of fire] with its maidens and countesses of the sublime levitation, and the powerful huaira- kuros [air worms], the yachay cometas [phantom comets], and the mighty yura- chirapa [white rainbow], a white boa with yellowish hair. They all go in front of the guards, who become paralysed. The vegetalista has to recover the soul and return it to the inert body. The healer meanwhile observes the shining planet Saturn and also cities located on other planets, such as the city of Jatabel on the right and the city in the middle background, called Luzidal, in another galaxy.

The one who took the young man usually changes into a monkey known as supay-machin [ghost monkey] or into a sajino [collared peccary, Dicolyles tajacu]. He transforms the ropes or lianas into aggressive snakes. But the sparrow hawks of the vegetalista hunt down these snakes. Behind the hawks are two meteors of the icaro de la yana-sacha [icaro of the black jungle] that enable the vegetalista to drive away these Chullachakis.

All these powers of the muraya cause the yakuruna to return the young man to the place he took him from, even though her father is smoking his pipe ceaselessly, trying in vain to make the young man stay. The young man's eyes are twisted by the yak uruna but he can still live with his family on Earth. If he also had his feet and head twisted backwards, it would be useless for a muraya to insist the young man stay on Earth, because the yakaruna's operations on him would have made him part of the green-haired yakuruna family.

It is believed here in the Amazon that the manes [spirits] of dead people take a bath certain periods of the year. The sound of rain is heard above, but no water reaches the earth. People say that dead people are taking a bath. This was revealed to me in an ayahuasca session near a cocha [lake] in the Maputay region,after I visited in my vision the mysterious dunes of Mongolia, the Himalaya mountains in India, and the great Sahara desert in Africa. In the session I mixed the science of vegetalismo or aiquimia palistica [plant alchemy] with Rosicrucianism, according to the teachings of the book La Cruz de Caravaca [The Cross of Caravaca]. We were six people in the house-one sick person, several neophytes, and me. Towards the cocha I was shown great pillars sustaining a platform. The manes were waiting on the lower floor for their turn to go up for a bath. These manes don't walk like normal people but float half a meter above the ground like the winds. After purifying themselves with a bath, they go freely in the space through the universe, visiting many temples. Above the house we see an aquatic plant with round leaves called raya balsa [unidentified]. The name derives from the fact that the shape of the leaves is like that of a raya [ray fish], and because this plant floats [balsa = raft].

A little above we see a plant called yaku-pichana [unidentified]. Its roots have the property of purifying the water, making it good enough for drinking or preparing medicines. Further up is a plant called shikshi huama [Dictyoloma Peruvian am], used for curing putanerta [from Spanish puta = whore], for calming women's sexual desires, making them less ardent. For this purpose this plant is cooked with albahaca [Ocimum micranthum]. Mixed with camphor and pucunucho it is used for the treatment of cancerous ulcers. In front of the house there is a yaku-yarinilla [unidentified]. A poultice of this plant is used in the treatment of rheumatic pain and to cure haemorrhoids. There is also a lobo-chupa [unidentified], a plant used when children have been harmed magically by an animal such as the dolphin. When children have mal aire del agua [evil breeze of the water], this plant mixed with cinnamon is burned, and the smoke expels the illness. Among the stones we see here is a flint stone, used in the treatment of pulsano. There is also a tray with earth brought from caves. Egyptians, Mayans, pre-Incas, Incas, and other people of antiquity used earth to cure many types of illness, a technique called geoterapia [geotherapy]. On the floor are pieces of wood of various trees, among them capirona [Calycophyllum spruceanum], muena [Endlicheria williamsii], timareba [Loetia sp.], and pajaro bobo, also called hiporuro [Dendrobangia boliviana].

Inside these plants are their spirits or guardians. They explain to the vegetalistas how these plants are to be used. Beside them are the sylphs of thunder and lightning, who teach how to heal by means of the sun, or heliotherapy. Inside the clouds there are other spirits, called puyo-runas [cloud men, mist men]. By contacting these beings one learns how to cure through winds, the influence of the moon, the night dew, and other atmospheric phenomena. The man seen standing is being cured with jagua or huito [Genipa Americana]. In the old times people mixed piripiri and jagua and covered their bodies with it to become strong. In front of the pillars there is a pool, and in it several large earthen jars. This represents the hydrotherapy used by the ancients, especially the Tiahuanaco, Chan ca, Chimu', and Inca cultures. When one knows how to use it, water may be very beneficial, and with it one is able to cure many illnesses. It is very beneficial to drink water out of ceramic jars, because the jars absorb the sun rays, and in them water is purified. These jars are also symbolic, because they represent flying objects used by spiritual beings to transport themselves from one place to another. In the upper right corner we see beings arriving in spaceships from the deserted plains of the planet Venus. They come to teach the shamans how to travel inside clouds, snow, or fog. They show the various forms of life existing in the universe. Beside them are other beings, dressed in red and black, called manan-umayuc, a name that means they have no heads.

She is the one who gives the vegetalistas power to diagnose illness by pulsing their patients. This power consists of an intuitive ability to interpret the pulse, connecting thus the hands with the brain. When a vegetalista touches a patient, his brain immediately gives a picture of what might be wrong with his patient. Queen Pulsarium Coya gives the vegetalistas arkanas or defenses. The vegetalista to the left holds a scorpion. When this vegetalista touches a patient who has been hit by a virote from a sorcerer, his scorpion will fight the virote, informing the vegetalista that this is a case of sorcery. The vegetalista next to him has been given snakes, which help him detect mal aire del agua [illness produced by the water], manchari [fright], and so on. The vegetalista wearing a blue shirt has a bayuca [caterpillar] on his left arm and a spider on his right arm. And so every vegetalista will receive various animals, such as salamanders, piranhas, etc. This queen also gives the vegetalistas various types of belts, so that through their navels they are able to detect the type of illness afflicting their patients.

The first layer, in white and pink, represents the pulsationâ€™s of an apprentice. The blue layer represents the pulsationâ€™s experienced by a muraya who is a healer, not a witch or a sorcerer.

In the upper left corner is a city called Korillacta [golden city], where beings live that are half human and half snake. The vegetalistas admitted here specialise in sucking virotes, or in extracting marupa sorcery with their manTis [magical phlegm]. The rainbow represents great snakes of fire that protect the city. The plant on the boa is the boa-sacha [unidentified]. Next comes the huiririma [Astrocaryum jauari], a palm that grows in inundated areas. This plant is endowed with electromagnetic force, which is shown by the fact that electric eels eat the fruits of this palm. In order to make the fruits fall, the electric eels beat the trunk of the palms. The icaro of this palm is sung by vegetalistas as protection against sorcerers using thunder as their weapon. Other sorcerers place the thorns growing on the trunk of this palm in their mariris, to be used as virotes that bring harm. On the next tree are two monkeys, of the kind known as bun-bun [unidentified]. These monkeys live in the trunks of rotten trees. They are never seen during the daytime but sometimes attack in the night. They are used both for doing harm or for healing, and are able to become giants. The vegetalista call on them when curing very difficult cases, because these animals have great powers in the spiritual realms. Next come two chicuas, the guardians of the ayahuasca plant [see Vision 1]. It is said that if the brain of this bird is fed to children under the age of twelve, they become very intelligent.

Next comes a camungo [Palademea cornuta], a bird used both in medicine and sorcery. This bird is able to perceive the faintest sound and can then alarm the vegetalista of any impending danger. In the upper right corner we see a spaceship coming from a distant place, near the edge of the universe, where darkness becomes solid and impenetrable. It has come here by travelling through trillions of galaxies of the unfathomable universe one can visit by means of the sacred plant ayahuasca. The people of the world from which this spaceship comes live in perfect harmony, love, and wisdom, without egoism and wars. Under the spaceship we see the itininga plant [Monstera falcifolia], which increases sensitivity in perceiving pulsationâ€™s. The roots of this plant form the beard of its spirit, a great king. Next comes an old man, the spirit of a plant called tamshi [Carludovica devergens], used in medicine for the treatment of baldness and cramps. This plant is also used in basketry and as cords in the construction of palm- thatched houses. This spirit is able to transform itself into an isula, a large stinging ant from whose dead body this plant grows [see Vision 9]. Under these two beings there are several plants: the pampa patiquina, which people have near their houses as a defence against sorcery; the yaku-oregano, used for ritual baths to restore the tranquillity of a patient; and shimipampana del blanco [Maranta arundinacea], used to tame wild animals and to calm people of bad character.

To the left is the aya-lagarto, a spiritual being with several eyes and spines on its head. On its back are small goblins that make noise at night. Here they are pounding rhythmically to accompany the icaros sung by those taking ayahuasca. Several other animals such as salamanders and bats move to the rhythm of the anacondas. In the upper left corner are several Indian and mestizo shamans. The one to the left is a mestizo, expert in the use of ayahuasca. Next comes a Shipibo curandero able to heal his patients from a distance. Then comes a Campa shaman capable of transforming himself into any kind of snake. The next one is a criollo [of white descent] shaman who learned to perform sorcery through the supay-tuyuyo. In this vision he tried to harm the Shipibo shaman with his supaytuyuyo, but the Shipibo sent his huaira-nacanaca [nacanaca = snake, huaira = airj to kill the bird.

The healer then starts to raise his defensive powers, such as the electric chain that binds together all the sorcerers. The fairy is waiting above and then ties the thread up with the laser thread that he canries in his lap. The sorcerer appears on a gilded kettle raised by infra-red beams.

Around his arm he carries a nacanaca snake [Micrurus sp.], and all his knowledge can be seen in the yellow- and violet- coloured figures on his head.The other man, dressed in green, is a witch and a sorcerer. He is a witch because he casts his spells so as to imprison a person and do with him as he pleases. He is a sorcerer because he casts a spell to kill the person he chooses.The one dressed in light blue is a perfect master who only heals. His aura is light blue and he shows his knowledge with the light blue and white colours. He carries the virote huani, which consists of glass arrows and a cumaceba [Swartzia sp.] bow for use in difficult situations. But if he uses this weapon, he then becomes a criminal. Of the strange beings that appear on the extreme left, the one on the top belongs to the green man, and the other two lower down belong to the witch and the red sorcerer. Two soldiers take from his bed the soul of a muraya, and they make him go to the red sorcerer singing the icaro sepultura tonduri.

The witches use this black boa as a battleship to attack their victims. It has a white stripe on its forehead, a sign that distinguishes it from all the other black boas. It lives in the depths of the black-water lakes and in lakes closed by the aquatic plant piripiri. It comes up to take sun-baths in mid-day, when the sun is fullest, to fill itself with the solar energies, giving power to its electromagnetism. When the boa is used by the witch, one can see in the vision that a big, electrified tornado rises up from it and liberates flying animals like the sarara, the bird rompe-mortaja, the tibemama, the supay-masho, the yaku-pato, the ayapollito, the suisui-fantasma, the nina-oishco, the tibe negro, and the uma-supay. Behind this boa come the yana-puma runa [black tiger-like people] who cover their faces with their hair. These beings have red eyes, symbolising that they are shitaneros [sorcerers]. They sing the sacrataquina, a maleficent song. They also have big eye-teeth, like curved sabres, and they can become people and animals of different sizes-for example, black water bulls, yana-caballos [black horses] that rise from the water, black yakurunas that ambush their victims on the beaches. Anyone going near them is bewitched by those malevolent beings, as even a mere gaze brings harm. Behind the head of the boa is the yaku-salamandra, capable of poisoning with its respiration alone. In the back are the puka-puma-runa [people with red tiger's features], guarding an aquatic plant that lives on the bottom of stony brooks with strong current, rising to the surface of the river to eat people. A shitanero calls in his visions a plant called shucui yahuarminta [a blood-sucker] to suck the blood of the Sinchicunan-muraya. The tree behind is called huanuchinampa-caspi [tree that kills].

The icaros of the curandero pull the black boa towards a hole in the ground, where it will be closed with circling discs, charged with radioactivity, which were brought by the great acrobats called yura-pachacama, white souls who take care of the universe. They carry daggers-poisonous arms that cause an unbearable pain. Behind them rises a priest of a marine town, emerging from the depths of the river. The name of the priest is Turmanshe, which means in archaic Quechua \"mes senger of peace.\" He comes to advise the curandero not to kill the witch that sent the black boa, but to punish him and let him go. From the ayahuasca pot rise two ayatullo-mamas, each carrying her spear ready to kill, spreading black tingunas that make the enemy nauseous. The great maestro Sinchicunan-muraya carries a pushaquita, a little pouch, and from there he takes a dagger of fire that flies and chases birds coming from the black boa's electromagnetism, killing them in the air. His disciples help him by chanting an icaro called makacushcan versucun [a song to win]. One disciple is healing a sick person, hurt by the witch with the air of the mother of the water while he was fishing in the lake. He blows him with tobacco and with the power of his medicine that circles around the body of the patient.

The sorcerer is singing the icaro sepultura tonduri, which makes the vegetalista and his companions uneasy, causing them either to vomit or faint. We see that his assistants are attacked by dogs, tigers, and other animals. A red dog bites one of the vegetalista's disciples while the snake he holds in his lap bites the dog. Others are blowing and thus sending powers to prevent the sorcerer from invading their place. The master vegetalista, wearing a blue shirt, raises his powers from the depth of the earth, which are the following: the alipa-tren [train of the earth]; the huitorunas, dark blue-coloured people; the macanun-cabalbs [battle horses] with their riders called huishchun runa, soldiers carrying spears; as well as the takshaurman or small fighter.
