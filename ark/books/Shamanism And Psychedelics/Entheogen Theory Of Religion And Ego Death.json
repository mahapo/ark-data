The ego death theory holds that the essence and origin of religion is the use of visionary plants to routinely trigger the intense mystic altered state, producing loose cognitive -association binding, which then produces an experience of being controlled by frozen block -universe determinism with a single, pre -existing, ever -existing future. Experiencing this model of control and time initially destabilizes self -control power, and amounts to the death of the self that was conceived of as an autonomous control -agent. Self -control stability is restored upon transforming one's mental model to take into account the dependence of personal control on a hidden, separate thought -source, such as Necessity or a divine level that transcends Necessity. Myth describes this mystic-state experiential insight and transformation. Religious initiation teaches and causes this transformation of the self considered as a control -agent, through a series of visionary -plant sessions, interspersed with study of perennial philosophy. Most modern -era religion has been a distortion of this standard initiation system, reducing these concepts to a weak interpretation that is based in the ordinary state of consciousness. The ego death theory is, specifically, the Cybernetic Theory of Ego Transcendence, and it incorporates the entheogen theory of religion. The Entheogen Theory of Religion The entheogen theory of religion holds that the main origin and ongoing wellspring of religion is visionary plants, such as Psilocybe mushrooms, Peyote, Ayahuasca combinations, Salvia divinorum , Cannabis, Opium, Henbane, Datura, Mandrake, Belladonna, ergot, and Amanita mushrooms. Visionary plants have been commonly used around the world throughout the history of religion and culture (Hofmann, Schultes, & Ratsch 1992), including in the various forms of Western Esotericism (Heinrich 1994). Greek and Christian mythic -religious systems often refer to visionary plants (Ruck, Staples, & Heinrich 2001). Leading mystics throughout the history of various religions have used on-demand, visionary -plant sessions with rationality -oriented mystic-state experiencing (Merkur 2001). Meditation, shamanic drumming, and liturgical ritual were developed as activities to do in the plant-induced dissociative state, not as methods of inducing the dissociative state in the first place. Origins of Christianity in Entheogenic Initiation The extent of entheogen use throughout Christian history has barely been considered yet (Hoffman 2006). Early Christianity involved mystical, religious, visionary experiencing, including the experience of the transformative, transcendent power of the Holy Spirit at Eucharistic agape meals (Johnson 1998). Early Christian writings show familiarity with ecstatic mania, inspiration, elevated sobriety, and “drunkenness” (Nasrallah 2003). The Jesus figure is portrayed in the New Testament as a spirit -possessed altered -state shamanistic healer (Davies 1995). The figure of Paul the Apostle is portrayed as a shamanistic mystic (Ashton 2000), and the apostles are portrayed as adepts in shamanic altered -state mystic experiencing (Pilch 2004). Solving the riddle of the original mystic-metaphorical meaning of Christianity requires also understanding the surrounding metaphorical altered -state initiation systems throughout Christian history, including Roman religion, Neoplatonism, Western Esotericism, and astral ascent mysticism."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 3 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm The large window of the Legend of St. Eustace in Chartres cathedral shows many ‘mushroom trees’ and unambiguous depictions of mushrooms; hundreds of depictions of mushrooms appear in Christian art. Sociopolitical Strategy of Canonical Christianity The New Testament editors utilized the era’s standard mastery of mystic-state metaphor and the altered -state experience of communal unity to direct the Jewish mystic-metaphor system into the figure of Jesus, profitably sweeping together the various quasi -Christian groups. They claimed themselves to have been appointed as the administrators of the Eucharistic gatherings by Jesus, who they portrayed as having been around just long enough to commission them exclusively with all authority. Jesus and all the apostles were entirely and strictly mythic (Doherty 1999, Drews 1924). The figure of Paul served as a controverted authorial token (Detering 1995). The authors and redactors of the writings attributed to Paul don’t mention any biographical information about the life of Jesus because the gospel story was a later, literary creation, based on many sources, including Roman imperial ruler cult, Josephus’ writings, and Hellenistic literature. Mystic revelation about self -will nullity was so routine, Roman imperial theology utilized the mystic-state revelation to legitimate the Roman sociopolitical arrangement. Christianity essentially charged the Roman system with mysticism -abuse and became popular as a counter -narrative about how the entheogen -accessed mystic revelation should be used for sociopolitical concerns. The figure of the ‘king on the cross’ in the New Testament is a depiction of the mystic-state insight of non -autonomous control, in service of a rebuttal and alternative to Roman imperial theology. Altered State Integrated into Ancient Culture The entheogenic altered state was integrated into culture, using metaphor to map all domains together, including banquets and parties, games, civic procession to a sacrificial altar, punishment, release of captives, sport, taxation, alliances, and war. A common standard banqueting tradition with reclining at table while drinking ‘mixed wine’ ran across many seemingly disparate cultural practices throughout antiquity (Smith 2003). ‘Mixed wine’ was the central, reliable means of accessing the intense mystic altered state throughout antiquity. Ancient ‘mixed wine’ specifically meant visionary -plant mixtures (Ruck 1978), such as Psilocybe mushroom wine.

Socrates’ initiation of elite youths outside official democratic channels carried political implications and risks, because ancient politics and religion were deliberately interlinked by mystic-state experiencing. Modernity a Single -State Culture The adept use and comprehension of metaphor faded after the battle between politicized Christianity and Scientism around 1700, leaving a long -term standoff between mystically neutered religious literalism versus exclusively ordinary -state -based Science. The culturally predominant type of religion in the modern era neutralized and reduced the traditional initiation system by a combination of non -transformative surface ritual and intellectual speculation based only in the ordinary cognitive state. The modern cultural experience resulted from the predominance of the ordinary cognitive state. The lack of culturally integrated altered -state initiation caused the egoic mental world-model, based in only a single cognitive state, to become completely predominant. Authentic initiation is widely present in modern culture, including art, literature, spirituality, and popular culture, but is not integrated into the official culture; for example, the song “Help!” written by John Lennon, the album Ride the Lightning by Metallica, and the Matrix movie series. Freedom for Higher -Order Religion Lower -order religion is derivative, limited to mundane conduct -of -life doctrine suited for the ordinary state of consciousness. The higher -order version of each religion involves transformation of personal control -agency concepts; revelation about control -system limits and dependence on the transcendent; and re-attribution of the origin of one’s will and thoughts. The essence of religious freedom is specifically the freedom to reliably access mystic-state consciousness, as in early, house-church Eucharistic agape meals, the ancient banqueting tradition, the mystery religions, and symposium “drinking -party” associations, all of which utilized mixtures containing visionary plants as their central sacrament. Suppressing entheogens because of their danger amounts to a blanket illegalization of higher -order religion and primary religious experiencing. As long as modern culture forbids itself the true, ergonomic Eucharist, legislating against the entheogen -based ecstatic heart of religion, religious freedom is restricted to selecting among various brands of lower -order religion; higher -order religion is placed off -limits, out of reach. The ever -expanding drug schedules directly conflict with the only kind of religious freedom that amounts to specifically religious freedom; that is, freedom to regularly and ergonomically access primary religious experiencing. The system of schedules is not from God, but is an invention that ignores the central role of visionary plants in religion, multi -state cognitive psychology, and the innate human drive to self -transcendence. Role of Democracy for Ecstatic Danger The proper role for representative democracy regarding drugs is to work out how visionary plants and psychoactive substances are to be healthily integrated into American culture, making dissociative -state religious initiation as ergonomic and as safe as possible. Drugs are not a problem to be eliminated and suppressed, but a means of maturing to be channeled. The Supreme Court of the United States has recognized the legitimacy of Peyote and Ayahuasca in worship; these plants have the same effects as LSD and Psilocybe mushrooms, including causing the person’s power of will and power of self -control to become seized and then restored in a religiously transformed configuration. The threat of the encounter with the power of the divine is the threat of loss of control of one’s thoughts when studying self -knowledge in the ecstatic state. This inherent danger of entheogens, a danger inherent in the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 5 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm studying self -knowledge in the ecstatic state. This inherent danger of entheogens, a danger inherent in the encounter with the power that transcends our personal control of our will, is mitigated by having a systematic theory about the nature of self -control agency, in conjunction with mastering the skilled use of entheogens and understanding how past cultures have accommodated this necessary danger which is the gateway to mature religious knowledge. Initiation as Natural Developmental Sequence Greek and non -modern cultures integrated a series of altered -state initiations. Initiation classically combines a series of visionary -plant sessions with learning perennial philosophy, followed by subsequent religiously integrated dissociation such as agape meals, festival banquets, and symposium parties. Entheogenic religious initiation was a prerequisite for symposium banqueting, so that participants were experienced. The banqueting tradition including symposium “drinking parties” included prayer and sacrifices; social recreation and religious experiencing were not opposed activities. The intention of a recreational or other non -religious user of entheogens is commonly overcome by the inherently entheogenic nature of the visionary plants, including revealing how personal control depends on a source of thoughts outside one’s domain of control – a realization which is the gateway to religion. Young adults naturally seek initiatory transformation; the modern culture of Prohibition demands that they suppress this drive and permanently stunt their growth, settling into the non -initiate’s mindset for life, foregoing enlightenment and religious revelation. The Entheogenic Future of Religion Ergonomic tools such as systematized theory and controllable entheogens in post -modernity will make the mystic state common knowledge again, but more explicitly and systematically than in antiquity. For example, Salvia divinorum makes the dissociative -state experience accessible, practical, and ergonomic. With the systematic ego death theory in hand, there is no need for heroic doses of psychoactives; moderate dosage is most effective. New, culturally intelligible metaphor -systems will result from culturally integrated agency -transformative entheogen use, including self -control cybernetics. The religio -political philosophy in the spirit of the United States is to accept entheogens, accept culturally supported religious self -control breakdown and transformation, accept the transcendent as the ultimate ruler or governor, but reject all earthly systems of government as being divinely authorized or approved. Hallucinogenic drug -plants will be revived as the authentic vehicle for the mystic state in communal religion, because they are immediately available to all people and fully ergonomic. Christianity will reawaken to its original idea of applying altered -state -based mental worldmodel transformation toward providing an alternate sociopolitical configuration or counter -narrative to any attempts to abuse mystic-state revelation by utilizing it to prop up worldly systems of sociopolitical governments that claim to be divinely mandated. The Dissociative Cognitive State Mental constructs are dynamic association matrixes of mental representations, held together by some degree of binding intensity. Ordinary -state cognition is settled and immersed in the standard egoic ruts of patterns and mental associations, such as trying to improvise on a musical instrument but ending up playing repeated patterns. Having a recognizable personality relies on such habitual patterns of dynamic mental construct associations, which are dynamic within a particular range or mode; behind their mask of habit-based, pseudo -separate agency, everyone is Dionysus (that is, the ultimate control -source). Entheogens cause their various phenomenological effects by loosening cognitive associations, causing mental construct processing to be revealed as artificial representationalism and projection."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 6 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm Ecstatic maenads mix visionary plants into wine in a wine -mixing bowl in front of a column and mask that represent Dionysus and the timeless frozen block -universe behind the mask of one’s pseudo -autonomous control - agency. Restructuring Enabled by Loose Association Binding The dissociative cognitive state loosens the mind’s associative binding, enabling deep revision of the interconnections between mental constructs. Revolutionary conversion to a new theory or world-model involves structural transformation of concept networks and hierarchies, increased explanatory coherence, concept recombination, and rational mechanisms of paradigm conversion (Thagard 1992). Religion and myth are about dissociative -state experience, frozen -time determinism, self -control cybernetics, and metaphorical description of these. In intense primary religious experiencing, the mental model of self and world undergoes a standard, pre -configured expansion and transformation to take into account the representational nature of experience, the experience of embeddedness in timeless unity, and the limited and dependent nature of self - control agency, assisted by metaphors describing the experiential insights."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 7 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm Like the egoic cognitive structure, the transcendent mental model is an innate, pre -configured structure that is discovered and revealed, like the adolescent discovers the innate ability to climax, and then is developed and refined, rather than being invented and constructed as though an arbitrary invention. The ability to mystically climax is inbuilt, as is the mental model that is revealed, although the useful metaphors and systematic explanation necessary to retain the revealed mental structure must be a product of human effort. Splitting of Representation and Referent Layers Salvia divinorum causes metaperception, which is the tangible perception of the layer of mental constructs that is the only thing directly presented to awareness. In the dissociative state, the vantage -point of awareness is raised, or stepped back a level, resulting in perceiving the cognitive workings of mental -construct processing and perception itself. Not only do associated mental constructs become separate from each other, the mental representation of each item perceptibly splits and separates from the represented referent , splitting into two perceptibly distinct layers: the representation layer present like a tangible painting, and a remote, speculative realm that is pointed to but perceptually absent, like a foreign country one has never directly seen (Hoffman 1996). A person lives their entire subjectively experienced life inside a simulation that their own mind produces by presenting mental constructs to awareness. In metaperception, personal control -power and personal movement through space and time appear as synthetic mental constructs. The Moving Control -Agent as Mental Construct The mind in the ordinary cognitive state generates the sensation of being an autonomous egoic agent wielding cross -time control -power while moving through time and space; this sensation is a projected, constructed, synthetic image and perspective. The ego -entity exists as a real set of patterns and dynamics spread across time, but the ego is not solid, continuous, or autonomously powerful in the manner initially conceived. As a mental construct, the self exists as a time -slice series: both as the entire series and as individual time -slices, with the continuant agent’s motion and control -power mentally projected from within each time -slice. Seeing the illusory aspects of mental representation of oneself, and feeling static spacetime unity in the absence of the accustomed sense of personal solidity, can be experienced as death – the ending of personal existence – because the egoic -mode mind identifies one’s existence with the projected image and sensation of the moving continuant agent and its control -power. Religious Effects of Salvia Divinorum Salvia divinorum is an ergonomic vehicle of religious revelation and transformative, initiatory mental -model regeneration. Salvia produces fewer bodily effects than LSD; it lacks the trembling, pupil dilation, temperature swing, and heart palpitation. The reduction of bodily effects, along with controllable dosage and short duration, makes Salvia ideal for studying cognitive dynamics about time, will, and control, including the nature of personal control agency. When Salvia is combined with understanding the present theory, one can be immediately and straightforwardly initiated into transcendent self -knowledge."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 8 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm Salvia can cause intense undulation of vision and of the mental body-image similar to Laokoon, the seer and priest of Apollo, wrapped by and wrestling with the two serpents of Apollo; Jonah, with the currents, waves, and breakers swirling around him and threatening to engulf him with turbulent waters, with seaweed wrapped around his head; and Medusa, with snakes moving around her head. The material plane itself, including one’s mental body-image, seems to undulate, not just one’s visual perception of it. Compared to mushrooms, Salvia produces less visual and auditory distortion such as color smearing, blurring, surface waving, bending, tracers, and audio warbling. Salvia causes sensations of explicit representationalism, frozen timelessness, spacetime embeddedness and spatial merging, and inability to control and steer one’s thoughts; awareness seems to sit still while thoughts arrive, presented and given to disempowered, passive awareness. Because of the short duration of smoked Salvia, the dynamics such as “voyage”, “long trip that plays out”, and “epic journey” are reduced compared to peyote or LSD; however, the same common theme can occur, “there’s no turning away from any control -crash that might be sitting up ahead on the worldline”. The duration of smoked Salvia is too brief to enable transcendent, dissociative -state emotion. Myth Describes Dissociative Phenomena Myth is metaphorical description of the intense mystic-state experiencing that results from visionary plants. Myth reflects dissociative phenomenology or dissociative -state experiencing, not ordinary -state experiencing. Visionary -plant states and otherworldly themes form the tradition of altered -state journeying (Culiano 1991). Many thematic categories of metaphorical descriptions have been used throughout history to describe dissociative -state sensations and experiences (Metzner 1986). Metaphoricity is a prime characteristic of the entheogenic, dissociative cognitive state (Shanon 2002). The hunter Actaeon saw the goddess Artemis bathing naked, so she turned him into an animal, and his own hunting dogs tore him to pieces. The Actaeon hunting myth comprises the dissociative -state themes of seeing divinity (the higher or ultimate control -level), transgression of control -limits, transformation of oneself, mental searching, dissociative fragmentation of the mental body-image, and the death of the initial self -conception."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 9 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm Depictions of Kali portray cognitive dis -integration of the mental body-image as dismemberment, and the sensation of splitting into multiple isolated time -slice selves. Triptolemus is shown as a charioteer or steersman in a Heimarmene -snake -drawn, winged chariot, with a large cup of psychoactive mixed wine given to him by the goddess Demeter or Persephone. The Block Universe and Frozen Worldlines"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 10 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm Time can be envisioned as a space -like dimension, forming a block universe that includes frozen, unchanging, snake -shaped personal worldline threads, each snake or thread representing a person’s entire subjective stream of thoughts during their entire life (Rucker 1984). Analytic philosophy and space -time physics have been brought together to construct a tenseless, static model of time (Oaklander & Smith 1994). This perspective is characteristic of altered -state perception. Time as a Space -like Dimension Salvia divinorum produces a strong sensation of spatial merging and unity. The static, frozen nature of time is perceived as a collection of present moments, with time as a space -like dimension, but with space itself seen to be not simply present, but rather, mediated through present mental representations. The feeling of Salvia is strange yet familiar, returning the mind to home -base – the block -universe Origin. Metaphors for experiencing embeddedness in the frozen, timeless block -universe include the end of time, imprisonment, and fastening the body to physical objects. Eastern expressions of experiencing the frozen timeless block universe and transcending the idea of autonomous moral agency include the Ground of Being or Tao that flows everywhere including one’s mind; escaping the endless round of moral karma and its unbroken causal chain; and avoiding rebirth into a material, mortal body. In the dissociative cognitive state, objects and the controlling ego -entity are explicitly perceived as extended across time; they are perceptibly distributed along a fixed and pre -set stream of time -slices frozen into position, such that a person appears as a living statue consisting of a series and set of statues or image -frames in incrementally different poses. Time is no longer perceived as a flow, but as a frozen expanse and positional relationship of stationary, distinct and separated time -slices, with mental constructs, including personal control -thoughts, permanently laid out across the time axis. Physical Fastening of All Thoughts and Actions In the dissociative state, all actions anyone has done in the world, good and evil, are experienced as physically attached to one’s own arms, body, and train of thoughts that is frozen into spacetime. Prometheus is chained looking out from the rock; Theseus and king Pirithous are fused into the banqueting bench in Hades’ and Persephone’s kingdom; king Pentheus is caught up in the tree looking out; Osiris is trapped in the coffin by his brother; these are all physically connected to the cross Jesus is nailed to, together with his elect: dissociative -state initiates."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 11 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm Hades imprisoned Persephone’s would -be suitors/abductors by fusing them to a magical bench and binding them to it with snakes while bringing them mixed wine. It was possible for Heracles to free the divine hero Theseus, but Heracles had to leave king Pirithous behind, fused into the banqueting bench in Hades for eternity, because the whole world shook when Heracles pulled him; this describes the dissociative -state sensation of physical embeddedness in the timeless block -universe, followed by abandoning the former pseudo -sovereign model of one’s personal control agency. Fixed Worldlines of Subjective Experiencing A person’s subjective stream of conscious experience constituting their entire life is a worldline frozen and embedded in spacetime in the shape of a snake or a thread woven and cut by the Fates to a predefined, finite length. To be bitten by a snake, as in the allegory of Paul the Apostle after his shipwreck, means to perceive the fatedness of one’s entire stream of thoughts. The seer Balaam rode his donkey on the road to Bamoth Baal to curse the Israelites, but ended up blessing them. Balaam had an unavoidable encounter with the angel of death on a narrow vineyard path with no room to turn away to the right or to the left, and was permitted to pass upon acknowledging that he speaks the words God puts in his mouth. A Pompeii house shrine shows a snake of pre -set inevitability reaching the sacrament placed on top of an altar. The initiate’s pre -set worldline of experiencing and thoughts, nearing the point of ingesting entheogens, was portrayed as a Heimarmene -snake that is destined and drawn by divine Necessity to drink the entheogenic libation of psychoactive wine in the wine -mixing bowl or cup of mixed wine, or consume the psychoactive sacrificial cake on the sacrificial altar."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 12 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm Banqueters on a bench are shown looking at a Heimarmene -snake ending up at their own cup of mixed wine. John the Evangelist has been shown as blessing a cup of the Eucharistic sacrament shown as a snake. A maenad, ecstatic follower of the god Dionysus, holds a snake, representing awareness of fatedness and the fixity of one’s entire stream of thoughts."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 13 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm Sacrifice is predestined and frozen into spacetime, comparable to the labyrinth path leading the sacrificial youths to the Minotaur in the central lair every year, and comparable to a city’s festival procession past sacred landmarks to a sacrifice at an altar. When Perseus shows Medusa’s Heimarmene -snaked head to king Polydectes and his followers at the feast with ‘mixed wine’, they turn into stone, helplessly frozen. Kwan Yin masterfully rides the fatedness -serpent through the turbulent sea, with a cup of visionary -plant elixir in hand. Accommodation to Everything Being Pre -set During the visionary -plant initiation, the feeling of being a control -agent moving through time and space is replaced by the sensation and perception of no-free -will – frozen -time block -universe determinism – while the mind adjusts its mental world-model to fit the transcendent perspective."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 14 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm The Israelites rebelled against the Lord, so the Lord sent snakes which fatally bit them; when the remaining people told Moses they had sinned in speaking against the Lord, he told Moses to put a brass snake on a pole, which the Israelites had to look at to prevent them from dying from these snake -bites. These themes indicate realizing personal non -control with respect to time: a pole serves as a clock indicating the time through the position of its shadow; the snake’s rigidity and shape represent one’s finite -length, pre -set worldline; and fatal snake -bite indicates ego death upon seeing all one’s thoughts as timelessly pre -set and given; to be cured of snake -bite and made immune to it is to continue life after ego death, purified of misattribution of the source of one’s thoughts and power of will. ‘The chosen race of God’, ‘the elect’, ‘the immovable race’, and ‘double -predestination’ express the idea that two sets of people are timelessly pre -determined: those destined to be experientially initiated into no-free -will, and those destined to remain under the delusion of autonomous personal control -power. The wide -eyed Minoan snake goddess ominously wields and controls initiates’ predestined, snake -shaped worldlines."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 15 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm The initiate’s eventual 2-level system of personal control can be represented as a divine winged snake that rules from above, interconnected with a personal pseudo -autonomous controller snake on the lower level. Vertical, Timeless Determinism Late antique consciousness was centered around the doctrine and mystic-state experience of the pre -setness of future thoughts and occurrences. Heimarmene (Fatedness, Necessity, or timeless cosmic determinism) was the central thematic concern of religions in the Hellenistic era (Martin 1987). Similarly, Philosophical Metaphysics investigates tenseless time, fatedness, agent movement through space and time, and controller agents (Oaklander & Smith 1995). The future is unchangeable and pre -set because of the static relation of control to the time dimension, and because of the illusory aspect of the continuant agent exercising power while moving through time. Modern science introduces clockwork determinism and thereby reduces the person to an automaton; Copenhagenist quantum mechanics aims to provide an emancipating alternative to the hidden -variables determinism of Einstein and Bohm, but limits this attempt to intellectual activity and a flowing conception of time that are based in the ordinary cognitive state, unlike the pre -modern approach. Two Jumps to Transcend Determinism Determinism is both a praised goal and a disparaged trap to escape, due to determinism -awareness being the intermediate but not final goal of religious mental transformation. Valentinian Gnosticism affirmed cosmic determinism but also transcended it, and formulated two contrasting schemes of thinking about moral culpability (Pagels 1992). 3-stage initiation paths centered around determinism are often posed as 2-stage systems: they both endorse and disparage the realization of determinism, which is the intermediate destination on the path to salvific regeneration. The first demon or stage of egoic delusion to be cast out is the assumption of simple independent self -command and freewill; the second demon to be overcome is the mental model of cosmic determinism or fatedness, in its practical problem -raising aspect."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 16 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm In Mark 9:14 -29, Jesus exorcises the ego -demon from a youth supported by his father; these four figures are aspects of the psyche. Fatedness and Control in Astral Ascent Mysticism Heimarmene or universal fatedness was centrally important in ancient astrological cosmology (Barton 1994), and a major theme in Hellenistic -Roman astral ascent mysticism and religion (Cumont 1960). Transcending astral fatedness involved ingesting holy food, ambrosial water, and astrological medicine (Fowden 1986). Astral ascent mysticism centers around the dangerous gateway or “fatal” boundary crossing – the sphere of the fixed stars – representing the apprehension of Heimarmene and its control of one’s thoughts. The planets wind around the world in a spiral pattern over time, depicted by the Heimarmene -snake wrapped around the cosmos, cosmic egg, or Mithraic lion -headed gatekeeper figure."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 17 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm Saturn, as governor or gatekeeper of the outermost planetary sphere which is associated with the sphere of the fixed stars, rides in a serpent -drawn chariot and eats the child or youthful self -concept as the price of passage across the boundary into the transcendent heavens beyond the starry Heimarmene -boundary. Ancient Jewish writings metaphorically describe mystic-state experiences, including the problem of how to get past various threatening gatekeepers that are encountered during ascent (Arbel 2003). Pre-modern Christianity held that the body (lower self) was controlled by Fate, but that the regenerated spirit (higher, ultra -transcendent part of oneself) was above Fate, residing outside the sphere of the fixed stars. Christ tramples the cross of cosmic Heimarmene as the X-crossed gates of hell, when harrowing hell and rescuing the elect from limbo (the impotence of personal control -power in the face of cosmic determinism and fatedness)."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 18 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm The hidden transcendent thought -source has been depicted as a hand behind a cloud controlling the world-soul whose spirit transcends material Necessity; the world-soul then controls Fate -subject creatures. Self -Control and the Hidden Source of Thoughts The ego is the sense of being a metaphysically free, sovereign agent that originates and controls its own thoughts, actions, and movements of the will while moving through time and space. Ego death is the cessation, in the intense mystic altered state, of the sense and feeling of being a control -wielding agent moving through time, and the replacement of that sensation by the experience of being helplessly, powerlessly embedded in spacetime as purely a product of spacetime, with control -thoughts being perceptibly inserted or set into the stream of thought by a hidden, uncontrollable source. The Goal of Understanding Ego Death Ego death leaves one’s initial, youthful “lie” behind – the confused mental worldmodel that assumes oneself is the ultimate creator of one’s thoughts, actions, future, and movements of the will. The goal of testing control in the altered state is not physically acting out loss of control, but rather, fundamental self -knowledge and correction of self -frustrating error and confusion: understanding the nature and limits of control across time by exploring ideas of loss of control and transcendent restabilization of control. The promise of increased power over oneself leads to realizing the logical impossibility of that mode of power, but produces instead a viable alternate conception, of secondary -level, reflected power. The vexing attempt to gain properly functioning self -control while holding a confused model of self -control ceases. The misleading sensation of the time -voyaging continuant agent being the originator of the power of will is recognized as a conventional misperception and mental oversimplification."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 19 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm The Lone Soul in Purgatory shows the soul as imprisoned in chains, purified in flames, and lifted up in redemptive release by transcendent power. In Gnosticism, the completed initiate belongs to the Immovable Race and is able to stand stably in the face of overwhelming, autonomy-undermining controllership emanating from the hidden, uncontrollable, primary control - level. Insights about the limitations of personal control -power result in a wounding of pride, but the mind is otherwise unharmed, and made more durable (“imperishable”). A personal control system becomes transcendence - compatible or “divinely approved” when it repudiates the assumption that it can depend on its own internal power to save itself during a control -limit violation. Deliberately Postulating Coming Control -Loss The religious path and method is to ingest entheogens; think about your self -control power; disprove cross -time control; then depend on transcendent power, rather than your own power, to provide coherent self -control; this transforms your ideas about self and control to conform to transcendent experiential dynamics, “conforming to the image of God”. The efficient method of enlightenment about the dynamics of control -agency is to test self -control power by deliberately supposing that loss -of -control is lying fated on the worldline ahead, and then struggling to use one’s personal control -power to avoid that potentially given control -loss event, while in the dissociative state. The ability of one’s immediate self to violate the accustomed desires or will of one’s overall cross -time self, including overriding the accustomed self -preservation restraints, disproves the impression that the time -voyaging continuant control -agent ever was in control as the originator of personal thoughts, and reveals that the true origin of the movements of the will the whole time was a hidden transcendent source other than the self conceived of as a time -voyaging continuant control -agent. Religious revelation is of our cybernetic control -cancellation potential and the ultimate source of control -power. Deliberately thinking about being helplessly, inevitably, and irresistibly drawn into the thought of near -future loss of control is a way of being drawn up into heaven on Elijah’s whirlwind or fire -chariot."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 20 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm The Control Breakdown and Transformation Potential After drinking mixed wine at the Last Supper, in the garden of Gethsemane prior to the court trial, Jesus began to be deeply distressed, amazed, and fearful (Mark 14:33), saying like an initiate as though of a necessary poisoning of the lower self, “Father, remove this cup from me; yet not what I will, but what Thou wilt.” The mind’s local control -agency becomes distressed and apprehensive about whether and how it can retain control, upon turning attention around, perceptibly recognizing its vulnerability to thought -coercion and control -instability, and seeing the illusory aspect of personal autonomous power. Ever -tighter, more forceful application of rationality that’s premised on the assumption of wielding control -power across time cannot save the control -system from seizure during the disproof of the cross -time phantom -self wielding power over each time -slice self. Testing our control -power and discovering our dependent puppet -like status entails deliberate disproof and self -cancellation of cross -time control, which can threaten to lead to panic attack, self -control seizure, and self -destructive control -chaos. Relying on one’s conventional power of control -logic and will, when fully developed and perfected, leads to system lock -up – the self -cancellation of personal control power. Demonic reason taken to its full development creates an impossible mess and gets itself tangled up, paralyzed in its own net of reasoning about control, power, and will. King Pentheus resisted Dionysus, the intruding foreign ruler coming in from outside the kingdom, a mad divine power undermining the ruling power of the local ruler; then king Pentheus was tricked into participating in an ecstatic -state excursion, was lifted and caught up helplessly in a tree, and was defeated and torn to pieces by his mother and other raving Dionysus worshippers. One’s role as the independent creator and controller of one’s thoughts was an illusion. The current time -slice self or time -voyaging continuant self is helpless to control or restrain the future time -slice selves while playing with the idea of having, keeping, or losing control; the result is like an army of lookalike time -slice selves, fighting against each other. ‘Idol worship’, ‘pride’, or ‘vanity’ is the assumption that the power of egoic control agency is real and substantial, and the futile attempt to depend on that doomed pseudo -power configuration to save oneself from the catastrophic failure of cybernetic self -control, which is inherently, systemically entailed. Julius Caesar was considered authorized for power by his seizures, and the bull in his military’s Mithraic mystery - cult was wounded in the side, so the figure of Jesus was shown as similarly authorized by the spear -wound in his side, and the figure of the apostle Paul was portrayed as suffering from seizures. The ability to make self -control seize or cancel itself dramatically is an afflicting thorn (2 Cor. 12:7 -10), hole, or wound in our side, the innate cybernetic governance -failure through which the new, transformed life is born. The new transcendence -aware self is given birth through the pride -killing disproof-wound in the side. Transcendent Solution to Restoring Viable Control A different approach and solution is required, to restore order from the chaos of self -dependence that’s based on incoherent premises, to provide a more robust basis than reliance on personal power wielded by the semi -illusory conventional self. Something that transcends personal control -power logic is needed to provide an alternative to the seized, useless logical scheme of egoic control power. After being shown this cybernetically fatal potential, a rescuing miracle of transcendent magic arrives from outside the system of egoic control -power logic. The mind’s transcendent potential kicks in, realizing that the logic of control -agency power originated by the phantom self cannot be the solution to the very problem that such an inaccurate configuration generated in the first place; one must put one’s reliance on a self -existing faith, compassion, heart, love, or benevolent Holy Spirit, which cannot have any ordinary rational control -logic basis and that one does not experience as a product of one’s own egoic control -power or will, but is consciously experienced as being given by the hidden source of thoughts."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 21 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm Solving the problem of true and justified mental order of personal self -government instead of control -chaos comes through a transcendent Zen jump. Depending on the egoic system of reasoning, which is constructed around inherently self -frustrating premises, ultimately leads to control lock -up and a catastrophically ineffective self - cancellation of control. Buddha recognized that his destiny was to touch the ground in an act of compassion and harmonious integration with the unity of the Ground of Being, causing Mara and his army of demons to instantly disperse – then he experienced enlightenment. Viable and coherent control is provided by recognizing that personal control depends on transcendent givenness of your thoughts by a mysterious hidden source that ultimately caused the control lock -up and independently saves your controllership, restoring it in a newly coherent form. The hidden source of thoughts that provides a viable, transcendent personal control system is personified as a merciful and compassionate God. The figure of Caesar was plugged into the routinized mystery -cult format utilizing ‘mixed wine’; these imperial - government themed mystery cults had initiation rites for mystai using ‘mixed wine’ heavily, along with symposium drinking parties (Pleket 1965). These imperial mystery cults incorporated themes of ending civil war to bring cooperation and prosperity among the former factions; defeat of rebellious nations, pardon upon sacrifice to Caesar, then incorporating them harmoniously into Caesar’s peaceful empire; and restoration of stable government by the divine higher -level ruler, with Caesar as Jupiter’s representative. Our control -power has the Judas capability – the ability to betray the illusory position of power, through divine, transcendent power -seizure, and thereby deliver our lower, “rebellious” claim of independent kingship -power over to the transcendent level of governing power."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 22 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm In John 11, Lazarus is transcendently lifted up from ego -death control -power paralysis by Jesus as the representative of the separate, higher -level source of thoughts. Jesus told his disciples “Lazarus is dead, and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.” Then Thomas (called Didymus , the twin) said to the rest of the disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.” Maria the Divine Shepherdess of Souls, Divina Pastora , as benevolent and trustworthy thought -provider rescues and protects the person from the direly threatening wolf, which is the threat of loss of control or hostile control - usurpation by the hidden thought -source. After transcendently being moved out from the doomed system of pseudo -independent personal control logic, one experiences the joyful sense of relief and thankfulness of having been rescued from certain peril from outside the resources one wields as a local locus of control and a time - voyaging continuant control -agent. Sin as Misattribution of Control -Thoughts"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 23 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm Upon initiation, the concept of ‘sin’ is reinterpreted and revised, producing a transformed mental model which understands ‘sin’ to be a logical error about the nature of control -agency and agent -culpability. Sin is a matter of understanding and meaning -shift. The secret of the kingdom of God has been given, but cloaked in double - meanings so that those on the outside may see and hear but not understand, lest they turn about and their sins be forgiven (Mark 4:12). In mystic metaphor, misunderstanding moral agency is considered the fundamental sin and immorality; God was most angry about the king’s rebellious worship of idols that are fashioned out of created materials – a metaphor for taking pseudo -autonomous personal control -agency as though it were genuinely autonomous. Reformed theology affirms the predestination of who God gives salvific grace to, while holding to the moral culpability of created persons – this Augustinian compound model is a bi-modal, metaphorical meaning -shifting technique, rather than a simply inconsistent combination of beliefs. A person’s will appears to be originated and controlled by the time -voyaging continuant agent that’s projected out from each time -slice along the person’s timelessly frozen worldline; the conception of personal control agency that is built around this illusion is ‘sin’ and the ‘lie’. Wrath, Compassion, and Making Peace ‘Wrath’ means the threat that Fate or blind, machine -like determinism is ultimately in control of your coming thoughts but is set against your claim to exert independent power over your thoughts. Mystic -state ‘compassion’ and ‘rescue that narrowly averts divine wrath’ means that that which ultimately gives you your thoughts is intimately united with you and is good or benevolent toward you, bringing you into a harmonious, reconciled, integrated relationship with the compassionate and beneficent controller of all that happens, including your own near -future thoughts. The wrath/compassion polarity is portrayed as paired deities of wrath and compassion in Tibetan Buddhism; dual traits of the Creator (justice and mercy); and Jesus as harsh righteous judge with Mary as compassionate intercessor. The god of battling and the goddess of love – Ares and Aphrodite (Mars and Venus) – were caught together in a near -invisible net, producing the child Harmonia (Concordia). Jupiter Optimus Maximus means ‘all -good’ and ‘all -powerful’, as is hoped for from a protective deity when one is vulnerable to awareness of Heimarmene in the intense mystic altered state."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 24 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm Mithras demonstrates that his arm wields control over the power of the bull’s shoulder. Sol is reconciled with Mithras in a pact, and given transcendent power. Sol becomes an authorized charioteer, steering the quadriga with Mithras, guided by Mercury (Hermes) holding a Fatedness -snake on a time -pole. Sacrificing to End Battling the Thought -Source ‘Sacrifice’ is a mental attitude of cooperative dependence on that which gives thoughts, your will having been overcome and made to will its own demise as an empty delusion, turned against itself by now -revealed transcendent power. Sacrifice offers up and hands over your claim to effective independent power, as opposed to battling against your near -future self and the inherently overpowering source of all thoughts and movements of will. Sacrificing your autonomy-claim, acknowledging your dependency on that which ultimately gives you your thoughts, brings mental peace and harmony and calms turmoil, because you are relieved from increasing your attempt to grasp and secure power over your own power; relieved from testing the power of your autonomy and the limits of your self -control thoughts. Roman sacrificial altars are typically shown with a libation of concentrated, psychoactive unmixed wine being poured on the altar, which opens up a channel to the gods, along with the sacrificial animal such as the unresisting, cooperative bull. The sacrificer pouring the libation has a cloth behind the head, representing the spiritual ecstatic state, where awareness is positioned outside of the usual mind, perceiving its functioning. Mithras overpowering and sacrificing the bull represents the delusion of self -originated control -power being given over to the transcendent level, with Mithras’ arm wielding the bull’s shoulder and his knife piercing and fatally wounding it; the wound in the bull’s side indicates Mithras demonstrating his power over the bull’s control -power."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 25 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm wounding it; the wound in the bull’s side indicates Mithras demonstrating his power over the bull’s control -power. Mithras wrestles and overpowers the initiate’s control of their will, reconfiguring their understanding of control - power to account for the transcendent givenness of one’s thoughts. Sol represents the mind’s awareness, which in the dissociative state is positioned ecstatically outside the mind’s functioning. The mind is possessed and overtaken by Mithras. Pure awareness passively watches the sacrificial disproof of the mind’s claim to wield independent personal control -power. A tauroctony shows: the self -command bull being sacrificed near the shoulder; a Heimarmene -snake inevitably drawn toward ingesting the entheogenic blood (often the snake approaches a wine -mixing bowl below the bull instead); a blue -stemmed Psilocybe mushroom in Mithras’ leg and garment with 7-stepped stem; the sphere of the fixed stars shown inside the underworld cave; a billowing cape behind Mithras indicating the ecstatic state; the god making the bull paralyzed and unable to stand; Mithras’ feminine features indicating the soul abducted and married by divine power; and Mithras turning to knowingly look back behind the conventional self -concept to see the source of thoughts and movements of the will. Vertical Atonement for Rebellion -Guilt Vicarious atonement entails a vertical shift upward of guilt and responsibility to a higher -level controller, not a horizontal shift sideways to a morally better person. A vertical 2-level legal and moral relationship applies to all controller/agent scenarios: master/slave, commander/soldier, potter/clay, puppetmaster/puppet, creator/creature, and virtual -world creator/virtual agent. Releasing a prisoner who is a rebel slave (claimant to autonomy), and punishing a mock king in their stead by death sentence, is found in the Roman Saturnalia and in the mystic allegory of Jesus’ trial; the rebel Barabbas (son of father) is released. The Jesus figure was portrayed in the New Testament as the earthly representation and manifestation of the all- powerful and all-controlling Jewish creator God (Thompson 2001). Jesus is held to be innocent in the sense of not himself rebelling against God (that is, he never mistook the pseudo -autonomy of personal control -agents as literal"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 26 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm himself rebelling against God (that is, he never mistook the pseudo -autonomy of personal control -agents as literal autonomy), but being the Creator’s representative figure within the created world, he was ultimately responsible or guilty for all instances of such ‘rebellion’ which did occur by other people. The dissociative -state revelation that higher -order power stands over the source of our control -thoughts is described as rendering the initiate no longer under the sentence of death, making them mature, washed clean, perfected, imperishable, or possessing eternal life, in that they have already died as an autonomous moral agent, following the pattern metaphorically expressed in the figure of Jesus. “Anyone who follows me must deny himself and take up his cross, for whoever loses his life for me will find it.” (Matt. 10:38 -39, 16 24-25; Mark 8:34 -35; Luke 9:23 -24) Lucifer fell from heaven, as Adam fell, due to pride through the virtual power of his virtual free will. Justice consistent with this metaphorical meaning -mode requires that he suffer a virtual death -sentence for his rebellious autonomy-claim; this sin is “punished” in the appropriate sense through mystic-state ego death and thereby done away with. Justice about ultimate responsibility is thereby fulfilled, and the initial, youthful error about our independent self -command corrected. The Sacred Marriage The sacred marriage or pact with the divine provides a transcendent personal control system that is viable and stable; is based on mature, refined understanding about personal control agency instead of misperception and frustrating confusion; and integrates one’s mundane -realm personal control activity with the transcendent realization that thoughts originate from outside one’s realm of control. In the ancient Greek tradition, marriage incorporated the themes of abduction and death of the girl, together with entheogenic initiation (Ruck 1978); similarly, Christ raptures -away and marries his Church, the initiated elect, as his bride."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"8/28/07 11:14 PM The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death Page 27 of 29 http://egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm Dionysus and the abducted/married soul, Ariadne, ride in Dionysus’ victory procession, in a chariot drawn by four mushroom -tigers. The uncontrollable hidden separate controller abducts and overtakes your innermost locus of control -power, as though that innermost wellspring of your thoughts is your generative organ and ego death is climax, giving birth to the new self that is married to the higher controller. The sacred marriage of hidden and visible levels of control, producing new life, is celebrated in the wedding banquet with entheogenic mixed wine.
