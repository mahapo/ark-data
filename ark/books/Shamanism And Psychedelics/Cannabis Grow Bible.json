PREFACE This book has been written under adverse conditions. In most countries it is illegal to own seeds, grow cannabis or use cannabis. Maybe it will change for you one day if you make the effort to have your voice heard. Until that day, it is recommended that you consult your local authorities to see what is your c ountries legal status with regards to growing cannabis. This book does not want you to break the law nor is it here for that pur pose. This book is about cannabis and how it is grown around the world. Even though the contents of this book may show you how t o acquire seeds and grow very potent plants, you are responsible for your own actions. We would like to see you grow cannabis ho wever we would not like to see you break the law. I would also like to say that many countries have permitted medical users to grow cannabis in their home.

There is still much work that needs to be done to provide something that is truly of bible size, but that will come in time. The reason why I know this is because cannabis suppression has suspended cannabis information gathering over the past 60 years. I can safely say that you can find books on Roses that are 10 times thicker than this book wit h heaps more information. Roses are not illegal in most countries, so scientists are free to explore the Rose. Sadly the same ca n not be said for cannabis......until now. The Cannabis Grow Bible (CGB for short) is new. New, in that the book is one of a k ind. Those who are willing to take serious risks in getting you this information have discovered most of what you will read and learn here. It is fine and easy for me to compile the book and write it. I am not at risk by printing this book, but those who g rew out hundreds of plants in their basement to provide me with raw data on this subject matter are at risk. It is with their he lp that they have been able to help me parse what is real and what is not in the world"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 _________________________________________________________________________________________ of growing cannabis. They have helped take facts and figures and use these to put together a book that would truly help someone grow bigger buds. The result has been outstanding and I am very thankful for what they did. In this book you will learn a numb er of things. Probably too many to remember all in one go if this is your first time growing. That is why I have broken the book into easy step by step portions. The book runs from start to finish just like a growing plant would. So you can imagine the lif e cycle of the cannabis plant being the foundation for the style and layout of this book. This is what makes the book work. It i s part essay / part science. Too many books do not cover the science very well and others do not cover the practical side very w ell. Here you will meet both worlds as one. There are some simple things you need to grow a cannabis plant and this book will explain all those things to you, but there are other things you need to know to grow a super cannabis plant and this is where th e book helps too, but it does not cross the two elements over which can sometimes confuse the reader."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 _________________________________________________________________________________________ The book will clearly define what you can or can not do, but most of the time this has nothing to do with your growing experienc e. It has more to do with how much money you are willing to spend, what cannabis strains you have, and where you are growing. A grower is not limited by their growing experience. A grower is limited by law, space, money, information and good genetics. We can not help you with money, space and the law, but we can help you with growing information and we can tell you where to obtai n good genetics. Don't ever let bad results hamper your new hobby. That is part of the process of learning. However, this book will point out some mistakes that people have made, so you don't have to repeat them and learn the hard way. Glance over this book and flick through the chapters. Get an air of what is going on. Then read it all from start to finish. By the time you turn the last page, you will probably have a bit of your own home grown bud in a pipe. If you can do that then tell people about thi s book. It is our goal to get everyone participating in growing the great herb."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 _________________________________________________________________________________________ This is not the final book on the subject either.

In Asia, one can trav el to the various regions around Mongolia and visit the cannabis plant naturally growing on the hillsides and across the vast pl ains, sometimes covering entire hill faces and spreading down onto the valley below. The Cannabis plant is a very adaptable plan t and can grow both in and outdoors. The Cannabis plant has managed to travel across the globe without the help of man. The see d has been carried by the wind, in bird droppings and has attached itself to animals that can, and do, trek over long distances. As you can see Mother Nature has distributed this plant in many ways. The origins of the Cannabis plant are not entirely clea r but today it is generally recognized by most biologists and cannabis researchers that it began itâs life somewhere in the Hima layas (Figure 1.1). "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Figure 1.1 - This is section of the map of Asia.

Today, human intervention has caused the Cannabis plant to grow under more controlled conditions and in areas where the plan t would not have had a previous history.

In certain countries the Cannabis plant has been identified as a dangerous drug and h as been killed off by human beings and law enforcement officials. It is treated as a weed and as a plant that causes social, men tal and physical problems. None of these reasons for removing the plant are well founded but the cull of cannabis has occurred a nyhow. The Cannabis plant was used for many things other than the extraction of THC (to be discussed later). Our ancestors, up until the late 1800âs early 1900âs, used the Cannabis plant to create clothing and other materials. The Cannabis plant or âhempâ as it is called in the textile industry is a very strong material and will withstand large amounts of stress applied to it. Hem p material is widely regarded as one of the best possible materials for producing fabrics. A pair of trousers made from hemp, or a shirt made from hemp will withstand the test of time. It is a far more superior material than cotton. This should give you so me clues as to why the fabrics industry wanted to put a stop to the cultivation of marijuana in the late 1800âs. Hemp fabric pro ducts will last longer than cotton fabric products thus the"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 _________________________________________________________________________________________ buyer buys less over longer periods of time. This is the first instance of the Cannabis plant being subjected to ridicule for capitalist gain. The Cannabis plant has been subjected to a number of stereotypical formats. The first one is that the resin pr oduced by the plant is physically addictive. This is not true and I will explain why. In psychiatry there is a list of classific ations for addictions of all abusive substances. It is contained in a paper called - ICD - 10 (classifications of Mental and Behav ioural Disorders) with you can read here. http://www.who.int/whosis/icd10/ Medical doctors are not informed clearly about the use and abuse of cannabis. This is because cannabis research is illegal in most countries or if research is allowed most of the results are suppressed. The only way a medical doctor can help a person with a cannabis problem is by having some experience w ith people who have had cannabis problems in the past. There are no special books to turn too. There are no references which exp lain clearly what to do or IF cannabis is physically addictive. There are no pills for cannabis addiction (there are for"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30 _________________________________________________________________________________________ alcoholism). The only place a doctor can go is to the archives of what other countries have said about the drug and it's abuse. As a doctor, one would maybe try Holland and read up on some of the material there, or Belgium or Switzerland. There can be foun d medical research papers that relate to cannabis dependence and all of them say the same thing. (A) Can it be abused? YES. (B) Can it be addictive? YES. (C) Is cannabis abuse or use life threatening? NO, but mental side effects such a depression can be, b ut only a small percentage of addicts (NOT USERS, BUT ADDICTS) go through this. (D) Has anyone ever died of cannabis use? ONLY 1 PERSON in the history of cannabis has died from its use, but read on. Bruce Lee, the martial arts expert died after taking cann abis, but the death certificate was later changed too 'death by misadventure' because of another medical herb that he took which he did not know he was allergic too. So the correct answer is 0 people have died from using cannabis. (E) How do you treat cann abis addiction? Psychotherapy is the only answer. In fact there are absolutely no reasons for the prohibition of cannabis, othe r than: "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31 _________________________________________________________________________________________ 1) It is hard to tell if someone is under the influence of cannabis. Driving/working with machinery may be problems here. 2) Peo ple might smoke too much and become a little lazy. 3) Many governments have prohibited it for over 70 years and it would seem ve ry stupid if they told everyone that they where wrong about it. Now let us look at these points for a moment. 1) Yes it is har d to tell and make no mistake - if you drive smoking cannabis then you are just as stupid as if you where driving under the influence of alcohol. It is never advised to use cannabis and then perform a procedure, like driving, which requires your total attention. As of yet there is no on the spot breathalyser test for cannabis use, but there are tests to determine if someone has used cannabis recently, in the last few hours, in the last few days, weeks or months. However, alcohol is not banned in a lot o f countries but cannabis is. "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 32 _________________________________________________________________________________________ 2) It happens. Some people do smoke too much pot and they become docile to the point where they just want to watch television an d eat. However, if there is no money about, and the person needs to survive or live somehow, you will soon find that person can restore their life back to the way it was before they started their cannabis binge by simply - Not smoking for a few days. A few days of not smoking is all it takes to rid cannabis of any effects it has had on the human body. There may be residual cannabin oids left in the system but this does not pose any problems and will soon wear away. This is not that easy with alcohol or heroin user. They will have to go through a long period of detoxification before they can resume a normal life. A cannabis user does not have to go through the detoxification period because there simply is none. Not only does the alcohol user have to spend a few days getting it out of his/her system but they will also have to deal with the withdrawal symptoms. This can last for mon ths. With cannabis, it is simply, stop smoking cannabis and resume operations as normal. (Note: Pharmaceutical firms would love to sell a pill to cure"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 33 _________________________________________________________________________________________ cannabis addiction, but as of yet can not. They can not prove that their pill does anything because there are no cannabis withdr awal systems to observe. Thus the pill would be deemed a fraudulent product if put on the market.) Also many homeless people's l iving standards in most cases are attributed to alcohol dependence/addiction and rarely, IF ever, is their low living standard a ttributed to cannabis dependence. Cannabis dependence is psychological. Treatment of cannabis addiction is done by psychiatrists and psychologists and GP's. Heroin and alcohol is treated by psychiatrists, psychologists, GP's and doctors of internal medicin e for the somatic systems of addiction. 3) This is a major problem because the government may have to set people free from prison and radically change their justice departments stance on cannabis which means that jobs will be lost and revenues will be lost if cannabis was decriminalized. Cannabis prohibition is a booming industry that creates jobs and capital. However if canna bis was decriminalised then these lost profits could be derived from a new cannabis industry."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 34 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Probably one of the best sites for medical information is www.lycaeum.org or www.overgrow.com One other thing to mention is that street cannabis may contain other added drugs. In most clinical cases, a person who complains about cannabis addiction and shows physical signs of addiction is not actually addicted to cannabis. They are addicted to the other drug substances that the supplier has added to his produce to make it stronger. 100% home grown clean cannabis does not contain physical additive propert ies. People who add other drugs to cannabis are not doing the cannabis community a favour. This is a good reason to grow your ow n pot. There are many strains or versions of the Cannabis plant alive today. Most strains are the result of human interventio n and these are the types you will most likely come across or even smoke. Breeders try to produce strains that are tasty, smell good and give the user different types of highs. These are the strains that are best looked out for because you can be guarantee d that the plant has got a âgrow"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 _________________________________________________________________________________________ historyâ behind it and that the seller of the seeds will know a good bit about the plant and how it âworksâ. This ends our br ief look at the history of Cannabis. There is much more to it than just this and many other books that discuss the legal aspects of Marijuana go into great detail about the history of Marijuana. In fact the history of Marijuana is so interesting and deep t hat a dozen chapters here would not cover the vastness of this plantâs background. HOW CANNABIS IS USED Whenever we hear th e word Cannabis we think of the famous leaf shape like the one on this bookâs cover. Many magazines show joints being rolled thi ck with leaves. Leaves are in fact the lesser potent part of the plant next to the stem and the roots. The cannabis plant can be divided into 6 main sections (Fig 1.2.). Bud, Stem, Branches, Nodes, Leaves, and Main Cola. "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Fig 1.2 - This is a picture by BigIslandBud. Each of the parts of the plant has been indicated. The 3 horizontal lines on th e right show 3 Node levels of branching and where they occur."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 37 _________________________________________________________________________________________ The next thing to know is that plants have a gender. The genders are male and female and sometimes a mix gender called the her maphrodite condition. Now listen to this closely. 1) The male plant is not used for smoking because it contains low levels of THC and does not taste very good, but it can get you high. 2) The female plant when pollinated does produce THC but produces a lso seeds which prevent larger quantities of bud from being produced. 3) A non - pollinated female (sinsemilla) plant will produ ce more flowering buds with no seeds and will produce higher quantities of THC than the male plant or a seeded female plant. The buds produce resin, which contain THC, and can drip down onto the leaves. When she is fully mature she should produce a very pl easing high depending on the grow method, the strain of plant and when it is harvested. To put it plainly, males can be smoked but"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 38 _________________________________________________________________________________________ are not very good and are considered vastly inferior to the female plant. The female plant when pollinated produces seeds and ca n be smoked but is vastly inferior to a non - pollinated female plant (sinsemilla) that produces more bud. It should be the goal o f every Cannabis user to grow non - pollinated female plants with big buds. The goal of a cannabis breeder is too produce quality seeds and plants. How both these things are done is what this book will help you to understand. At the end of the Cannabis pl antâs life cycle the plant is harvested. This means one of two things. The plant can be completely uprooted and treated (called a complete harvest) or the plant can be harvested a small bit and used again for a second flowering term (this is called re - vegi ng (Figure 1.3.) and re - flowering). "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 39 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Figure 1.3 - A plant that is being re - veged. Picture by Vic High.

Once the grower has selected the parts they want, they then set about curing their harvest (Figure 1.4). Curing your harvest is important. It helps one to produce a finer product. After the curing has been done the grower can t hen choose how he/she wants to finally produce their smokable mix (figure 1.5). They can use the cured plant as it is and smoke it dry or they can produce hash or oils from the curing process. Figure 1.4 - This is a picture of some cured buds.

"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 46 _________________________________________________________________________________________ THC Cannabis plants produce psychoactive ingredients called cannabinoids. The main ingredient of the cannabinoids that gives t he high effect is called - delta 9 THC. All strains vary in THC levels that come in different percentages. Some plants may conta in 100% THC but the \"levels\" of THC may be low. Other plants have only 60% THC, but the \"levels\" of THC may be very high. A goo d potent plant will have both levels and quantities very high. Plants produce something called - delta 8 THC. This ingredient is in low levels but does contribute to the high. When we mention THC levels, we are talking about both delta 8 and 9. There are also other ingredients that add to the high such as CBD, CBN, THCV, CBDV, CDC and CBL, but are only very minor compared to THC. The difference between THC levels and THC quantities is that THC levels are genetic. They are not under the influence of the g rower. THC quantities on the other hand are. This is to do with bud mass and how much resin can be generated in that bud mass. S ome bud may only"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 47 _________________________________________________________________________________________ contain 20% THC, with a THC level of 5. The same plant grown under better conditions and light will produce 70% THC, with a THC level of 5. The â5â is genetic. The quantities of 20% and 70% are under the growerâs control. When examining a strain in a seed - bank catalogue one is guided to check for the THC levels of that plant to understand how potent the plant is. Many seed sellers and breeders measure their plants THC levels and give accounts on how much THC their plants have. Of course many breeders like to exaggerate on how much THC their plants produce, but some do not. If you wish to know more about THC levels it is best to con sult your seed - bank or breeder for details. No complete study of cannabinoids has been made public since this bookâs publicati on. This is because cross breeding produces so many different results that it is hard to keep track on what is happening. Some ' old timer' strains are still around and have been tested. This information can be obtained from the larger seed production compa nies in Holland. THC testing is also an expensive process that requires heavy amounts of research. The other"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48 _________________________________________________________________________________________ interesting factor is that some plants do not produce any THC at all. These plants have been genetically engineered (GM) to prod uce very low levels of THC and are mainly used by farmers in some countries who have permission to grow cannabis for hemp produc tion ONLY. It is best to keep away from these seeds and strains. They will not get you high. There is project called the PMP (po tency monitoring project) that is carried out by some government - funded agencies, but the results are questionable. ZERO ZERO The other thing that may interest you is that Cannabis can be cured in various forms and one of these popular forms is HASHISH (Figure 1.10). "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 49 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Figure 1.10 - This is some raw hash extraction by Kryptonite. This hash should be pure without any additives. "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 50 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Hashish can also be graded and one of the most famous grades of Hashish is called Zero Zero. Hashish making (Figure 1.11) can improve (but sometimes degrade) the overall potency of marijuana. The grades of Hashish are as follows. 00(zero zero), 0, 1, 2, 3. Zero Zero is by far the most purest form of Hashish on the market today and comes from plants that have high levels of THC in conjunction with a good Hash making technique. Sometimes the technique may be good but the levels of THC in the plant are low. This may produce a grade such as a 2 or a 3. It is wise to note that the Potency of a plant depends on a number of factors. It should be the goal of every grower to produce a potent, high grade, product. Zero Zero is also a 'western' concept derived from hash types that come from Morocco.

It is within these glands that one is to find the main concentration of produced cannabinoids and THC. When a plant is in full flowering the resin gland can explode or break dropping resin down onto the leaves below. This can also give the leaves their sh iny frosty potent look during flowering. Towards the bottom of the plant are located the fan leaves. These leaves are generally large and collect most of the light for plant growth. Because these leaves are far away from the top of the plant, which produce the most amount of resin glands and buds, they collect the least amount of resin and are not very potent.

One must also be aware that some plants are very potent and can literally knock oneâs soc ks off. This is where taste comes into play. Some people like plants that give a head high but do not cause one to fall asleep. Other people like plants that give a down effect and cause the body to become less responsive to stimuli. The body down is calle d âThe couch - lock effectâ. The head high is simply called âThe head high.â Now another thing must be considered here. Remember that we talked about Species of Cannabis - Sativa, Indica and rudereralis? Well rudereralis is hardly used much today. Sativa and Indica are extremely common and these 2 species will be the main focus of this book. Also both species have two different fo rms of high. The high of each species can be controlled depending on the time at which you harvest. Not only this but the specie s can be crossed to produce Indica/Sativa type plants or Sativa/Indica type plants. This may sound all very confusing at first, but it is in fact all quite simple. We will explain more about this in our next chapter.

Now remember that we said an Indica/Sativa cross would produce two different highs. Well we lied a little. If they are both 50%/50% crosses then the high will be a 50%/50% mix. Indica/Sativa and Sativa/Indica is really the same thing. Pure Sativa is a total âHead Highâ. Pure Indica is a total âBody Stone/couch - lockâ.

So when we look at some strains that are crossbreeds we must understand whic h species the plants are leaning towards. Along with the cross you can expect that the plant will look different. Some Sativa pl ants may be shorter because of the Indica breeding in them and some Indica plants may be taller because of the Sativa breeding i n them. This is okay though because later on we will find that as a grower we have control over how a plant will look and grow. As a grower we can influence height and plant features. We can also harvest the plant in such a way that we can produce a differ ent high type. The later you harvest the plant the more you will help induce a couch - lock effect.

This, by far, is the best way because, (1) You get the seeds for free and (2) you know what the high type will be because you have alrea dy tasted it. The next best way is the Internet. The Internet is full of seed - banks that wish to sell you seeds, but there are a few problems that you may encounter. The first problem is that some of these seed - banks will rip you off. The second is that s ome of these seed - banks do not ship worldwide. The third is that some of these seed - banks misrepresent their stock. The fourth i s that seeds can be very expensive. Some seed - banks sell seeds anywhere between (US Dollars = $, UK Stirling = Â£) $80/Â£70 and $300/Â£290 for 10 - 16 seeds.

If you find a seed - bank then the first thing you should do is to examine what people have to say about that seed - bank. The best way to find this out is to check one of the more popular websites on the net like www.yahooka.com. Some web site s give listings and ratings on seed - banks. You can also do a search on the net using a search engine like AltaVista or Yahoo. Find a good web site that is run by a number of people and not a web site that is run by one person. A community of users is a g ood place to go for message board forums and chat. Also check to see that the site has a registered URL, like a .com site. If th ey use a free web site service then consider staying clear of it because it can disappear without trace overnight. Once you have found a web site then run a search on 'seeds'. A listing may appear of all known seed - banks that deal over the Internet. It is best then to check out the reviews on each"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 65 _________________________________________________________________________________________ seed - bank by the public. A good one is www.yahooka.com. This gives the latest update on each seed - bank and gives them a review o ut of 5. Find the URL of each seed - bank and check out the prices. Some seed - banks do deals on seeds and you will find that price s do change from bank to bank. The next thing you do before buying anything is to send the web master an e - mail. Ask him about h is services, what seeds you like, how he delivers, security arrangement, and if he can deliver to your country. In some countrie s seeds are legal. In others they are not. Wait until he gives you a reply. If you do not get a reply then do not use that seed - bank. These people are salesmen and should communicate with you and answer all your questions. Also ask how the money should be sent and ask about postage and packaging. Most seed - banks sell their seeds in batches of 10 - 20. This means that you will ge t 10 - 20 seeds in the post. Anything can happen. A misplaced foot in the postal office can kill the seeds, making them not viab le. Good seed - banks provide good packaging. Ask about it. If your seeds do not arrive send an e - mail to the seed - bank and ask them what happened.

The more people complain the better the chances of indicating seed - banks that are ripping people off. Also if you get your seeds in good condition then it is always wise to post a good review of that seed - bank. This will also improve your communication with that seed - bank the next tim e you buy seeds (you may get discounts). If you do not have access to the web then you will have to get addresses for these seed - banks and send them a letter asking for further information. Some seed - banks have even advertised in the back of this book. WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN CHOOSING SEEDS Okay, so now you have an idea of what type of plant you want and the seed - bank that you are going to use. The next step is too check if the seeds are for indoor or outdoor use. There is a saying that all cannabis see ds can be grown indoors and outdoor.

The answers depend largely on the size of your grow area and what your budget is. Letâs say we have about $200/Â£180 to spend on seeds. We can b uy an expensive strain like a G13 cross and then we can grow the G13 and produce more seeds from it. We can get anything between 100 and 2000 seeds depending on plant size and grow conditions.

This will allow you some degree of experimentation as you may fail on your first attempt to germinate the seeds because of lack of any previous cannabis growing experience. For people wh o have germinated seeds once before in the past, it is advised that you germinate 5 followed by another 5 the next week. If you are a long time grower with a good amount of growing experience then you can germinate all 10 in one go. Again you do not have t o do it this way.

"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 102 _________________________________________________________________________________________ This is a method whereby the seeds are placed either on a damp towel or on a damp piece of cotton wool. Cheesecloth may also b e used. The seed is then covered with more damp wool or a damp towel. The towel/wool must be kept moist at all times. If the mat erial dries out it may damage the seeds. Everyday check to see if the seeds have started to produce any roots. If they have then immediately transfer the seedling to a grow medium (such as soil) using a pair of tweezers. Do not touch the root. This has a m oderate to high success rate. Out of 10 seeds 8 - 9 may germinate. The problem with this method is that sometimes the transplant can cause the seedling to go into shock. This can kill the germination process leaving you with nothing. With practice you can get all your seeds to germinate.

At the bottom of the tray is a small area where water, or even better âsome germina tion hormoneâ is poured. Small grow cubes called rockwool cubes are placed into slots in the tray, which automatically dips the rockwool into the solution (Figure 3.8).

Picture by Shecky Greene."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" 105 _________________________________________________________________________________________ DANGERS WHEN PROPAGATING SEEDS Drafts are a killer and will stunt germination. Always make sure that you keep your germin ating seeds away from any open windows or fans. Also make sure that the room is kept warm. A cold room can inhibit your germinat ion rates. The other thing to look out for when using germination fertilizers is to make sure that your mixture is correct. Do n ot use high doses of fertilizers with seedlings. In fact water is all seedlings should need. You do not need to add anything. So me people do use germination solutions though, but make sure that you keep these solution strengths down low. An incorrect mixtu re can burn your seedlings and cause them to fail. Another thing to do is to leave your seeds alone to grow. Do not go fiddling with them, hence the term âdigging up your seedsâ. Some people tend to disturb the soil to see how their seeds are doing. This i s a bad move and can break or even damage the seed and root. The other thing to keep in mind is that some strains produce seedlings that have weak stems. This means that the seedling may tend to lean, sometime more than 90 degrees, to the left or rig ht. If you"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" 106 _________________________________________________________________________________________ find that your seedlings need support then use a small stick to hold your seedling up. Tie the stem to the stick using a piece o f thread. Never tie the thread above a growing shoot or the seedling will push up against the thread and tear itself. You may co ntinue to use a stick to support your plant as it grows. If your plant still has a weak stem during vegetative growth it is reco mmended that you give the base of the stem a little shake. This will help the plant to develop a more solid stem. Outdoors the w ind shakes a plant and causes it to develop this solid stem. You can fake the wind by doing this mildly every morning for two or three seconds. However if you read on you will find that indoor fans help do this. (Note: Never bring a stick from outdoors ind oors for support as the stick may have some bugs on it. Some bugs such as spider mites can go undetected in their incubation nests inside the wood.) Seeds must also be viable if they are going to germinate. Never use white seeds. These are immature. Find seeds that have white and grey markings or another colour apart from white."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" 107 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Crushed seeds will also not germinate. Old seeds may have trouble germinating. Always try to use the best seeds you can find. T RANSPLANTING During the stages between germination and vegetative growth the grower may find that he/she needs a bigger pot. T ransplanting is done nearly always as early as possible. One example of a transplant is when the seedlings are ready in their Ro okwool SBS tray. The seedling is lifted from the tray along with the rockwool cube and placed in another grow medium such as soi l, or maybe even a hydroponics set - up (more about hydroponics later). That is called a transplant. There is not much of problem when transferring the cube and seedling to the soil. Just dig a small hole in the soil for the cube and place it in. Cover the c ube with soil. The cube will not effect your plants growth and will add support if anything. If you have started your seedling s in soil then you may want to transplant the plant to a bigger pot. The problem with transplanting is that people like to move the soil and roots along with the plant from one pot to another."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" 108 _________________________________________________________________________________________ This means that the plant must be lifted out with the soil in place. How is this done? Well there are two ways. The first way is that one does not need to remove the plant from the smaller pot at all. All you have to do is cut away the base of the small po t and place this pot into the bigger pot of soil. The roots will grow down through the bottom hole of the old pot and into the n ew one. The roots will always find their way down. The other way is too make sure that the soil is very dry. Delay watering your plant for a couple of days and let the soil settle hard. Then you can use a clean knife to cut around the inside of the pot. Cu t deep, but do not damage the roots. When you have done this push your fingers down into the side and lift the plant and soil ou t. You will have some breakaway soil but this does not matter, as long there is not too much of it lost. Quickly place the plant into the larger pot and fill with soil. Give your plant some water so that it will take to the new soil. Never ever try to lift your plant by the stem. Even though the stem may look safe and strong this nearly always causes problems down the line. You sho uld always have a firm grip of the soil when transplanting. Some people like to"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" 109 _________________________________________________________________________________________ clean the roots, but I would not recommend it for cannabis. If your soil is very compact you maybe able to turn the pot upside d own and tap the whole medium out as one solid mass. During some transplants the cannabis plant may go into shock, even if your transplant was clean and perfect. If you have kept your plant well it should survive. If the plant has not been looked after it may fail quickly. A good grower always takes care of his/her plants. Transplant shock is caused by a disturbance of the roots. I f the roots are cut or fall down, the plant does not respond well to this. This is why you must always make sure that you keep a firm hold of the soil during transplants. Also refrain from feeding them for 1 week if you can. There are some transplant feed ing products that work as hormones out there and you may wish to have a look at those. GERMINATION SOIL There are many soils out there that advertise themselves as germination soils. They basically are the same as any other soil except they contain mic ronutrients and are kept somewhat 'clean' (the soil is sifted and no"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 110 _________________________________________________________________________________________ compost is added). Ordinary loam soil with a pH of 7 and an NPK of higher or equal amounts of N than P or K is good for starting seeds in. Even the ratios of NPK @ 5:1:1 or 8:4:4 are good. Just make sure that the N is equal too or higher than the P and K f actors on the label. More about soil later. INDOOR AND OUTDOOR GROWING We are now coming to the first core divide in growing marijuana. At this stage you should now know something about the History of Cannabis, How it is smoked, Cannabis Species, The Ca nnabis High, Seeds, How to choose and obtain seeds, Grow factors, The life cycle of the plant, Propagation, Germination and Transplanting. Now all these things are generally pre - production methods except for Transplanting. You are about to take your seedling and put it into your main grow area. This means that for the next 3 - 6 months your plant is going to be located in a c ertain environment. That environment is either indoors or outdoors. So let us talk about each in brief for a moment.

Natural light and Artificial light. Both ways have advantages and disadvantages. The first thing you should know is that indoor lights produce bigger flowers (more bud) than natural window light. This means you get more THC quantity with artif icial lights than you will with natural sunlight indoors. Even in countries that have hot sun for 6 months of the year you can s till find it hard to produce big buds indoors under natural light. Some people have grown plants under an attic window that they open during the dry days. This will grow you bud but not as much as you would get using an artificial light system. The other s ide of the coin is that natural light is free, electricity is not and grow lights are a little bit expensive to buy and use. The y are not as expensive as it is to run an electric cooker 24 hours a day but they are still expensive to use all the same."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 113 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Figure 3.10 - The Sun.

Try to guess when you will get the best weather. Coordinate this w ith the flower times directed by the breeder and you will be able to foresee your harvest time. Also remember that people can look up and see your plant if they are sitting near the window. Do people come to wash your windows? Also remember that if you h ave a sativa plant then they will get big. Take all these factors into consideration when you are growing your plants with natur al sunlight indoors. If you are growing indoors then you may have a room or part of a room that you wish to use such as an at tic, closet, basement, spare bathroom or hot press. These locations nearly always need artificial light. You may even decide to build a cabinet yourself. There are many ways to set - up an indoor grow room.

Some people will rip - off your plant in a second if they see what you have (Figures 3.13 and 3.14). Others will just call the cops. Security is vital. I once heard about a small hippy community who lived near a forest here and grew their marijuana near a stream. They eventually had to stop growin g as their plants where being ripped - off by the locals in the town near by. It also must be understood that the thieves where no t just teenagers either. Adults will do this too. In some cases where the cannabis industry is booming, rippers are professional s and this is their main source of financial income.

"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" 120 _________________________________________________________________________________________ The best way to conceal an outdoor garden is to grow the Cannabis plants among other plants that will mask the cannabis. The ot her way is too grow the plants is inside a brick cubicle with a sheet of glass on top. Some of you may have the advantage of liv ing out of town and have gardens in which this kind of stuff can be constructed. Hide your crop well. Everybody does not easily spot marijuana but someone who is trained to watch out for this plant will see it right away for what it is. If you feel that un wanted people may see your grow area then you might want to invest in some form of a greenhouse that has the windows painted white but the top glass left clear. The white walls will help reflect the direct sunlight coming down around your plants. Guerr illa growing is hard work and most often prone to rip - offs. By planting in a forest or in someone elseâs field you are not in an y danger of being caught with the plants ON YOUR PROPERTY. Having said that the personâs property that you planted on is at risk . Be a nice grower and do NOT plant on someone else's property. It is not a nice thing to do and looks bad on the cannabis growi ng community. Find a public area such as a forest or a hill"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 121 _________________________________________________________________________________________ slope. Look for an area that is away from the public eye. Look for an area that will receive plenty of light. There are lots of places for this sort of thing. You have just got to spend time finding them. This is the key to guerrilla growing. Find a good p atch and you will have good bud. Figure 3.15 - Photograph by Mullummadman. Your grow patch, whether on your own property or public property, must be treated."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 122 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Leaving seeds in the soil and coming back four months later is generally not going to get you good results.

Figure 3.16 - A night shot of an outdoor grow by Slowhand."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 123 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Some guerrilla farmers keep it simple. What they do is start their seedlings in small plastic pots indoors. When the seedlings have developed the grower cuts the bottom of the pot away. A small piece of cardboard is taped to the bottom of the pot. The pla nts, in their pots, are then taken to the grow patch. A hole is dug in the ground and the pot and plant is placed in the earth. The cardboard is removed and the hole is filled in with soil. That way you have germinated your plant and only need to worry abo ut secondary factors such as light, security and pests. The roots will find their way out of the bottom of the pot and into the soil below. Don't worry about the roots not finding a way out of the pot. They always do, that is their job.

This however may not always be the case. Some strains have male plants that produce more THC than other males of a different strain. Sometimes the male can be stronger than a female from anot her weak strain. Most male plants from good genetics are stronger than the Ruderalis female. Males can be smoked or made into ha sh oil. Simply wait until the plant is flowering and then clip the top 6 inches of the plant away and remove the leaves. Throwaw ay any stems and branches. Cure these leaves and then find out for yourself if the male is any good or not. You may be in for a surprise.

At the end of your germination period you may have found that 25% or more of your seeds have not managed to pop out. You can help these seeds to grow by using a method known as Scuffing. Simply get a small box, like a matchbox. Line the inside of the box with sandpaper. Place the seeds into the box. Cover the seeds with more sandpaper. Close the box and shake the seeds in the box for a few minutes. Now the seeds are scuffed and their outer shell should be easier to pop open. Plant these seeds i n soil and they should be able to germinate.  "},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" 130 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Chapter 4 SECURITY Before we go any further we should really address this topic because it crops up so often. Security is alw ays an issue whether you are an outdoor or indoor grower. We have learned before that the best way to secure your grow area is t oo prepare yourself fully for any event that may occur in the foreseeable future. Pre - production security arrangements are very important. A sudden peak in your electricity bill may attract unwanted attention from certain authorities that look for these things. This may seem odd to you, but it does happen. It is now common practice that most countries who still have prohibition on cannabis plants set up special task squads to track down growers. The most often used technique by these agencies is tracking purchasing orders. Many agencies keep a tab on certain grow shops and look through the items that are being sold to outside cus tomers. This tracking requires a special court order but the"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 131 _________________________________________________________________________________________ police can obtain this with ease. If someone has been identified as buying suspicious grow products, then the agency will also t ry to find out what other things have been bought using the same credit card or another electronic money transfer medium. Many a grower have been caught out this way. The best way to avoid this system is to PAY CASH. Seed - banks are also sometimes tracked by certain agencies that watch for incoming mail with certain stamps and envelope headers. Sometimes it is not the agency that do the tracking but people themselves in the post office who want to rip you off. IT DOES HAPPEN, and quite a bit as well. To ge t around this most seed - banks do not head their mail anymore. If your seed - bank does head their mail with their company address it is best to keep away from that seed - bank in future. If you have done the right thing then you should have all your growing tools and kits bought via cash and your seeds purchased from a good seed - bank that has good seeds and a safe secure way of sendi ng you their product. Many seed - banks use great stealth to get you your seeds. It is advised that you never have seeds sent to y our grow area."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 132 _________________________________________________________________________________________ INDOOR SECURITY When growing indoors try to consider certain factors cropping up in the near future. Like visits from repa irmen or gasmen. Some growers have a grow room which they can sweep clean in under 1 minute. This means that they have a closet near by where they can quickly move their plants too, if any visitors do pop up. Always keep your security closet near your gr ow area. It is no good walking around your house with five or more plants in your arms. It is a bad idea to use your toilet for the backup security area unless you have another one that the guest can use. Apart from this backup area the other thing you mu st consider with indoor security is the smell. Now Super Skunk and Skunk#1 are very smelly plants. When the plant is in flowerin g she begins to stink.....Hence the name - Skunk. If you live in an apartment complex then there is no way you will be able to h ide the smell unless you have some form of an EXTRACTOR FAN or an OZONE GENERATOR (Figure 4.1). "},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 133 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Figure 4.1 - This is a home made Ozone Generator. Picture by Shipperke. In some indoor set - ups a fan can be used to extract any unwanted smell away from the corridor outside. It can be pumped through a window or filter to another area where the smell w ill not be noticed. Not only that but plants love fresh air and wind, so the fan can do two things at once for you. An Ozone generator is a device that can be purchased from most grow shops. It helps to get rid of cannabis odour problems. "},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 134 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Apart from the smell problem the other problem you will have is with fires. Now this is a very important thing to know about. S ome people growing indoors tend to use very shoddy lights with even shoddier fixtures. NEVER EVER USE ANY LIGHTING KIT AND FIXT URES THAT ARE DAMAGED OR NOT SUITABLE FOR INDOOR GROWING. Many people have lost their homes because of this problem. Taking shor t cuts with lighting and electricity is a big no no. I have heard off and met many people who have come home only to find a fire brigade outside who have just finished putting out the fire which engulfed part of the house. The same thing happens in every c ase. The grower gets closer and sees a number of police officers looking around the room. The fire officer points to the cause o f the fire - a half melted light fixture with burnt out sockets. The officer looks around and sees the plants all crispy and black. They both know what this is all about. Why do they know? Because they have seen it a hundred times before. New Marijuan a growers nearly always make the mistake of creating inferior lighting set - ups. Needless to say that this is because of three th ings. (1) They donât have the right"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 135 _________________________________________________________________________________________ information because of government censorship laws. (2) They do not have the money to invest in a proper lighting system. (3) The y just want to grow their pot quick and fast and cheaply. We will discuss proper lighting systems in another chapter. OUTDOOR S ECURITY As we have said before the best way to secure your outdoor garden plants is via a shelter. One must also remember that some outdoor plants do smell and this can carry over a short distance given the right wind and the right climate. Most peop le would not know what the smell is but some DO! Many growers get around this problem by growing cannabis plants that have very little smell during flowering. These types of strains are listed by most seed - banks. Again you should ask about strains that hav e low smell levels. All Cannabis plants smell to some degree during flowering.

Some people go out to their garden with black plastic bags and drop the bag over the plant before pulling it up. This way you will not expose your crop to anyone. Some people do their harvesting at night. This is not recommended though as it can draw unwanted attention to you. If you are growing your plant outdoors in the open without a shel ter and away from the general public then you may want to create a pen for your plants. A pen made from chicken wire will preven t any unwanted predators such as deer or rodents from eating your plants. Predators are a big problem with outdoor growing. We w ill talk about pests later. GUERRILLA GROWING SECURITY Tracks left behind from your ventures too and from your grow area are the worst give - away for any guerrilla farmer.

When choosing a spot find an area that is not too dense but not too sparse either. Some Guerrilla growers have even created small gro w baskets that they hang from trees away from the public eye. If the baskets are well camouflaged then you can get away with loa ds! As a guerrilla grower you should always wear gloves when handling your work. If you have buckets near by do not leave fin gerprints on any of these. Also you will want to consider having a good reason for being in your grow area. Imagine that you are walking back from your path, with no crop on you, and a police man jumps out of the bush. He says - âWhat are you doing here?â. Of course you know that there is a river near by so you show him your fishing rod or your binoculars and bird spotting book.

This is when you must go from your grow area to your h ome with your growing rewards. Always do this as early as possible in the morning just as the sun rises. Always double - check the area for any suspicious looking people. Pack your buds and plants into black plastic bags (brown paper bags are better) and the n put these into a backpack. Walk towards the edge of the forest /woods/clearing and quickly drop your bag down against a bush a nd cover it up. Walk towards your car and look around again. Drive your car for about five minutes and look around to see if you can see anything. If you see anything suspicious, or anything following you leave the bag and go to town (not home - leave that until the situation is under control again). If things look okay, drive back to where you left your bag. Pick up your bag and p ut it in the boot or trunk of the car. Drive home carefully. Some people can get away with guerrilla farming lots of pot. This is commercial growing on a risky scale but can still be found in various parts of the world where cannabis is still banned.

MH lights tend to give off a blue tone, while HPS tend to give off an orange tone. WHAT TO LOOK FOR WHEN BUY ING A LIGHT. The first thing to say is that some growers have a MH set - up for seedlings and vegetative growth and a HPS for fl owering. The HPS is a better flowering lamp, while the MH is a better veg lamp. If we can only afford one we should get a HPS. B oth MH and HPS can be used for vegetative growth and flowering. However since we are growing for bud, we should try to get the b est HPS we can.

Then check to see if the light is air - cooled. Some of these lights have a fan built in which kee ps the light cool. If you see this then you know that you are going to need somewhere to vent your air. This may mean that you n eed to adjust a wall in your grow area so that the air is extracted from the light.

Most expert growers like to keep a room at a stable controllable temperature and use these air - cooled lights to achieve that. If your light is not a ir - cooled then you will have to build an air vent and fan in your grow room wall to keep the temperatures under control. Cannabi s leaves will burn if placed too close to a HID light. Figure 5.13 - This is a water - cooled light system. These inventions ha ve been around for awhile but have not caught on that much because they require a good bit of work. A constant pump of cool wate r must be circulated into and out of the light system.

In most cases you will be able to make your own stand if you feel that you are not willing to fasten a few hooks and chain s to your ceiling. Also check to see if the electrical fittings suit your needs. Will they plug straight into your system at hom e or do you need an adapter? Maybe you might require an extension cord with your purchase. Most HID kits can only take a specifi c wattage of bulb and a certain type of bulb. If you have a 600W HPS system, then you should only use 600W HPS bulbs. Some light ing kits have something called a 'switchable ballast' (Figure 5.14). This means that you use both MH and HPS lights with the sys tem. Check your kit for further details.

Last but not least is the most important part of your light. The wattage and lumens. WATTAGE AND LUMENS HID Lights can range anywhere between 75W and 4000W. In general the stronger the wattage the more light that bulb will produce. However we must also consider another factor and that factor is called Lumens. Lumens are the correct way of measuring how much light per square foot a bulb e mits. Lumens and wattage do go hand in hand but can vary a large amount between"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" 161 _________________________________________________________________________________________ systems. The better the lighting kit, the better the lumens it will cast. Lumens have more to do with the design of the light th an the wattage of the light itself. Some 600W lights may give the same lumens as a 400W light. Have a look at this chart: This is interesting because we have two types of HPS lights using the same bulb wattage and one of the types is casting more Lum ens than the other. The reason for this is that the higher lumens kit is better quality than the other. So we now know that some lighting kits produce better Lumens than others. Check through HID lighting kits and look at how many lumens they cast. This is a good indicator of how professional that light is. Also a 4000W HID is too much for one single plant. A 1K bulb is the maximum limit per light you should use. Use several 1K bulbs if you need more light. A 4K bulb will bleach Cannabis and is very hot.

How many Lumens do I need? Well this depends on three things. (1) How m uch do you want to spend? (2) How many plants do you have? (3) How big is your grow area. You do not want to go less than 2500 Lumens, even for one plant. You want to get the best so you need to hit the 45000 mark or more. In general one light that casts 45000 lumens is enough to cover a workspace of about 3 feet by 3 feet. This is quite an average space and you will probably get anything between 6 - 9 plants in that area. Again we must keep in mind the strain that we are growing. One large sativa plant ca n cover a 9 square foot grow area in no time. Short indica plants are different. You can get maybe 12 plants into a 9 square foo t grow area. If you really want to pump up your plants then you may consider a lamp that casts 100,000 Lumens or more. If you wa nt a bigger grow area then you may consider 2 lamps that cast 100,000 Lumens each. All is relative to how much you want to grow and the size of your grow room. Letâs say for the record that we would like"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" 163 _________________________________________________________________________________________ to grow 4 plants. Then what we should aim for is a light that casts 45000 Lumens. This means we should buy a 600 - Watt HID system . Letâs say we want to pump up our available light to around 60,000 Lumens. This means we should buy a 1000 - Watt HID system. If our area is bigger we might need 2 or more 1000 - watt HID lights to achieve this. It all very respective to the 3 elements we men tioned above. There is nothing wrong if you want to use a 1000 - watt HID light on 2 plants. They will grow bigger and better. T he only thing is, do we really want to spend all that money on the light and the electricity bill? HID lights range anywhere be tween $220/Â£200 and $700/Â£670 for a full kit. You may be able to buy the parts and build your own, but this is only recommended if you have some experience with lights first. A 600W HPS kit should cost about $250/Â£230. This is money well spent if you want great plants with big buds. Over time you will understand more about grow rooms and how to light them properly. With experienc e you should be able to tell what light suits your needs. As a general rule, when in doubt buy a 400W HPS or better. "},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" 164 _________________________________________________________________________________________ LIGHTING FACTORS AND HOW TO GET THE MOST FROM YOUR LIGHT The reflector part of the lighting kit can also cause a difference i n lumens cast between two different systems using the same bulb. The reflector does it exactly what is says. It reflects light. The other thing to consider is that when the light bounces off the reflector it is going to fall down on your plant. When it doe s your plants will absorb this light. Not all of the available light is picked up by the plant and some of the light will escape and reflect off your workbench. Your bench may even absorb some of the light. This is your light that you are spending money on so why not try and do something about saving this escaping light. Some reflectors are very good and some are very poor. Reflect ors should not be any colour other than white or polished metal. Some reflectors may have a small green film of plastic covering their insides. Remove this if you can. It should just pull off like a piece of tape. Many people get mirrors or tin foil and line their grow area with it.

This means that only a small amount of your light is reflected back towards your plant. What you need is s omething white. White is the best colour for reflecting light, period. Not shiny glossy white, just plain âflatâ white. A white wall will reflect more light that a mirror will. Many growers like to paint the walls of their grow âflatâ white. This helps a l ot. Other people like to line their grow area with the back end of tin foil wrapping (the white side). This is okay, but make su re that you use the white side and not the shiny side. A substance which looks like a tin foil sheet, called Mylar (Fig. 5.15), is very popular in cannabis grow rooms. Instead of using white walls you can use this reflective alternative. Most DIY and hard ware stores will sell it in roles.

"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" 169 _________________________________________________________________________________________ SOIL Soil comes in many types and varieties. What you will find as you go along is that you will add various ingredients to y our soil to improve plant growth. The Cannabis plant will grow long and winding roots into the soil. These roots absorb water and other minerals from the soil to help it grow. The soil also goes through dry periods when you do not water your plant or whe n the plant has absorbed most of the water. During these dry periods air is allowed to creep in between the soil particles, allo wing the roots to breathe. There are 3 main factors to look at when buying soil. (1) pH, (2) Nutrients and (3) Structure. pH pH is a way of measuring how much acid and alkaline is in the soil. The pH scale runs from 1 - 14. 7 is neutral, 0 is very ac idic and 14 is very alkaline. Cannabis plants in soil like a pH of 7. When choosing your soil you should"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":" 170 _________________________________________________________________________________________ be looking for a pH of 7. It should tell you this on the bag. Going above or below this mark can cause your plant problems durin g growth. Small pH meters (Figure 5.18) can be bought in most gardening shops and can be used to measure the overall pH of your soil. Figure 5.18 - This is a picture of two cheap pH meters that can be purchased from most grow shops. NUTRIENTS The thr ee major nutrients that are found in soil are Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium or NPK for short. NPK can come in two forms - with the soil or as a stand - alone fertilizer (usually in a bottle). When you look at the bag"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" 171 _________________________________________________________________________________________ you will see that the % of each part is stated. Such as 20:20:20. This means 20% N, 20% P, 20% K. The remaining 40% is just othe r elements that make - up the soil. In liquid it would usually be water. This ratio can change between different types of nutrient and soil brands so we need to understand what Cannabis likes. Cannabis plants like good levels of N and a normal level of P an d K during vegetative growth. You need to pick a bag that has all three, not just 10:20:0. When looking at chemical fertilizers you need a mixture that has the first number higher or equal to the rest. 12 - 12 - 12 is fine, 20 - 20 - 20 is fine, 12 - 6 - 6 is fine and 18 - 4 - 5 is fine. The 12 - 12 - 12 and 20 - 20 - 20 are the best ones to find. Something like 8 - 20 - 20 is not suitable for vegetative growth. Bags with higher P are for flowering plants. As a grower we do not transplant to new soil for flowering. We simply use p lant feeds to bring up the P levels during flowering. STRUCTURE Try to find a soil that is not too moist. In other words try to find a soil that dries out well and does not hold water like mud. It"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":" 172 _________________________________________________________________________________________ should say on the packet whether the soil is a wet or dry one. Try to find a balance between the two. Wet soil will sometimes ca use plant damage because your roots need air to breathe. Dry soil may also dry out too quickly and needs to be watered more ofte n. Try to find a soil that is loose and feels fine but slightly heavy in your hands. Basically the soil structure is up to you. Do not buy anything that is hard and bulky or too soft and weightless. Medium Soft and heavy is what you want. SOME COMMON SO IL TYPES There are many more types of soil mediums out there and here we will briefly go through a few.

Marijuana plants are best kept in pots that are somew hat large (1.5 - 3 gallon pots) because cannabis does grow long roots. Also you are better off buying a pot that has some form of perforations (holes) at the bottom. The perforated pot sits on a small dish (you should be able to buy these at the same time you buy your pots).

What happens is that the water may also leech down some of the nutrients that you have added to your soil. Over - watering can c ost you time, wasted nutrients and even kill your plant. Before you use a pot make sure that you clean it thoroughly before use to get rid of any unwanted chemicals or dust that may have gathered in the shop or factory. Pots are very cheap to buy.

SOIL CONTROL As your plant grows through its life cycle it begins to absorb some of the minerals from the soil. Wh en it does remove minerals it adds some waste material of its own.

The soil flush is, in its essence, over - watering your plant to the point of removing most of the minerals and ingredients in the soil. If your plant manages to pull through you have done well. If your plant does not then you will know better next time. A soil flush causes the plant a great deal of shock and should only be attempted as a last resort if your plant is dying and can not be cured by any other means. If your plant ma kes it, the plant may have sustained some damage. If any of the leaves are burnt or look dead you can remove them from the plant by clipping them away. Plants usually take about 2 weeks to get back to full health. pH - bringing back to neutral from acidic : If the pH of your soil is too acidic then you may want to bring it back to a natural 7.

Don' t let a bad growing encounter put you off. pH - bringing back to neutral from Alkaline: If the pH of your soil is too alkal ine then you may want to bring it back to a natural 7. To correct this you need to make your soil more acidic. Here is a list of ingredients that can each be used to return your plants PH to 7. - Cottonseed meal - Lemon peels - Ground coffee - Some Fertilizer s also are very acidic and can bring the pH down to 7."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":" 194 _________________________________________________________________________________________ When using this method always moderately apply the substance and check the pH. Over time you will know what measures to use. This is best left up to the grower as he/she will know how big their pot is and how much should be added. Experiment a bit and l earn as you go along. pH up / pH down: These products are available in most grow shops. They actually act as a pH agent for adjusting your soil pH. They only come in two forms - pH up and pH down. More and more people are using these chemicals to adjus t their soil pH. NUTRIENT CONTROL Remember NPK? Well, NPK are the primary ingredients that are needed in soil for marijuana to grow well. NPK stands for Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium. In addition to these there is something called secondary supple ments. Secondary supplements are found"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" 195 _________________________________________________________________________________________ within the soil but sometimes not all of them are there. The secondary supplements are as follows. Ca (calcium), Mg (magnesium), and S (sulphur). CaMgS for short. There are also seven more micronutrients. These are as follows: iron, boron, chlorine, manga nese, copper, zinc, and molybdenum. These micronutrients are not extremely important for good plant health, but the secondary nutrients and Primary nutrients are. Check your bag to see if it has some secondary nutrients. Sometimes a Ca, Mg, or S deficie ncy in the soil may cause growing problems for your plant. If the soil is lacking one of these factors your plant may start to d isplay a nutrient deficiency. Mg problems are common. To correct this feed your plant a 1/3 of a spoon full of Epsom salts per 3 gallons of water every 3 - 4 weeks. If your soil does not have these properties and you feel that you are going to have future problems then simply find a feeding product that contains these elements. Next time you feed your plant you will be able to sup plement it with these missing secondary nutrients.

Lockout is a chemical reaction that takes place among the nutrients in the so il. It can occur if a large amount of one single nutrient is added. This can lockout the other nutrients, preventing your plant from using them. If lockout does occur then you need to flush your soil. FEEDING Feeding is the process of adding to your soil what the plant has taken out. You will only need 3 types of feeding solutions throughout your plants growth. You will need a bottle of feed where the NPK has equal or higher levels of N than P and K and you will also need a bottle that has higher leve ls of P than N and K. The first one is to be used during vegetative growth and the second is for flowering. You will also need a third bottle of secondary nutrients. You should only feed your plants when they need it. The amount of feeds that you will us e is relative to your growing conditions and strain. Most plants only need to be feed every"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" 197 _________________________________________________________________________________________ fortnight at 50% or less than what it says on the label. Marijuana plants burn easily. So never mix your solution at 100% . If it says use 1 cap full of feed per 3 gallons of water, then use 1 cap full per 6 gallons of water. Sometimes you might even end up burning them using these low levels. This goes for both flowering, secondary nutrients and veg feeds. You should never have to feed cannabis plants once a day. During flowering simply switch the feeding bottle over to the one with the NPK where P has high er levels than N and K. You may want to add secondary nutrients once every 3 weeks to your grow. Epsom salts is a great way of g iving your plant Mg, which is probably the most important secondary nutrient. AIR During vegetative growth and flowerin g, cannabis plants love to get fresh air. Always keep a window open and let your grow room refresh itself every day. The fresher the air the better. Also during the dry periods, in between watering, the roots like to breathe. Fresh air is always the best a ir. During winter you may want to reduce the time you leave the"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":" 198 _________________________________________________________________________________________ windows open as the cold may stunt growth. Just refresh the air in your room for 15 - 20 minutes during winter and close it agai n. If your grow is enclosed, then use fans to extract the old air and another fan intake to refresh the system. HUMIDITY C annabis plants work best in the 40 - 80 percent relative humidity area. rH (relative humidity) is the amount of water in the air . Fresh air always is the best way to control humidity. If you have a rH measuring kit you can judge for yourself how much fresh air you need before hitting the optimum 60% level. There are some expensive devices called De - humidifiers that control humidi ty in the room. This is not recommended unless you have a very large grow area underway. Just use fresh air and you can't go wro ng. TEMPERATURE Temperature is controlled by any heating unit or natural sunlight that your room receives. Normal households have suitable"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":" 199 _________________________________________________________________________________________ temperatures for growing cannabis in. The best meter for temperature control is the human body. If you find it is too cold in yo ur grow room then so will your plants. 75 degrees Fahrenheit is what you should aim for. Slightly warmer rooms do help plants to grow a bit quicker. Use a thermometer to analyse your roomâs temperature. If too cold, turn on the heating. If too hot, open a window and maybe even use a fan. C02 (CARBON DIOXIDE) Plants enjoy C02 and release O2 during a process called photosynthesis , but more 02 is released than C02. Since our plants would like more C02, the grower can use a C02 generator to help the plants growth. C02 also helps grow bigger buds! Since room C02 levels in general are low the plants can use a bit more.

Then one day you notice that the plant is not growing much taller anymore. It seems to have s topped. You take a closer look and see that there appears to be small new growths at most of the nodes between the stem and the branch. This is new to you. These have not developed before so you ask yourself, âwhat are they?â Your plant is now reaching t he end of its vegetative stage. These small new growths are going to produce more leaf, branches and FLOWERS. The plant is now e ntering its Pre - flowering stage.

You closely look at the new growths (Calyx) to see if you can identify your plants sex, but it is still too early to tell . The early stages all look the same you say? What should you do now? You do not know? You will have to wait and see. There ar e three things that can reveal your plantâs sex early on but these are not 100% accurate. They are more of an educated guess. So remember these methods can fail to be accurate but most of the time they are a good indicator. First Early Sexing Method: If you have been growing the same strain and all the seeds at the same time, then you may notice that some plants are taller th an others. This is a sign that the smaller plants are female and the taller ones are male. If you want too, you can separate y our"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":" 205 _________________________________________________________________________________________ plants into two sections in order to see how good your guesswork was when you do finally identify sex. The other thing to know i s that male plants in general start to pre - flower before females. If you have taller plants that are producing new growths befor e the smaller ones, then the taller plants are probably male. Second Early Sexing Method. A good way to identify plant sex a t early date is to look at the calyx with the aid of a very fine magnifying glass. (See last page of this book for pre - flowering /calyx illustration) If the calyx is raised on a stem then it is probably a male. If the calyx is not raised on a stem then it is probably a female. Third Early Sexing Method. Force - flowering a cutting is probably the best early sexing method out ther e. Simply take a cutting from the plant that you want to sex and place the cutting in a cup of water or into a cloning medium su ch as rockwool. Give the cutting 12 hours light and 12 hours total darkness. The cutting will flower and display"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" 206 _________________________________________________________________________________________ its sex. Clones will carry the exact same genetic make - up as the plant it came from, including sex. These methods are NOT 100% accurate but will help you to understand more about the visible differences between male and female plants. In a moment we will explain how to identify sex properly and completely. THE PRE - FLOWERING TIME Your plant will Pre - flower between 1 and 2 weeks and during this period the new growth regions begin to change shape depending on whether the plant is male or female. It is during this shape change that you can properly detect your plant's sex. WHEN TO FLOWER? Pre - flowering is a sign that your pla nt is mature enough to start flowering. As a grower you have a simple choice to make. Do you want to flower now? Or do you want to continue vegetative growth? Here are a few facts before you make that choice."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":" 207 _________________________________________________________________________________________ - Most cannabis plants can be kept alive for up to 10 years by simply keeping a light on the plant at all times. These plants w ill grow to a certain height and then form into a bush. It will then eventually stop producing branches and will spend the rest of its life growing new leaves to replace the old ones. - Bud production is not equal to the height of your plant. Bud product ion is equal to your growing environment, your strain's genetic make - up and the amount of nodes that the plant has. All nodes ar e potential bud areas, but every strain has a genetic threshold for bud production. - It possible to get more bud with lots of plants which are flowered as soon as they are mature (which also keeps them shorter and smaller), than extending vegetative grow th with less plants until they reach their maximum height and size.

"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" 209 _________________________________________________________________________________________ If you have pre - flowers and want to flower you only have to do one thing. You must put your plants under a 12/12 schedule. Figure 7.2 - A Picture of an indoor grow by Mia Stoner."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" 210 _________________________________________________________________________________________ THE ALL - IMPORTANT 12/12! Most people never get good results or bud quantities from cannabis plants because they have never he ard of 12/12. 12/12 is easy to explain. Cannabis plants grow outdoors naturally between the months of April to October/Novembe r. This means that towards the Sept/Oct/Nov dates the plants will be in flowering. During this time the days get shorter and the nights get longer. When this occurs the plant is under 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness. When this 12/12 PHOTOPERIOD occurs the plant is naturally stimulated to flower. If the 12/12 continues then the plant will produce its flowers. As long as 1 2/12 continues the flowers will grow larger and more plentiful. This is part of the cannabis plants evolution and how it has tau ght itself when to flower. Naturally as a grower we want lots of flowers so we need to put the plant through a light cycle of 12 /12. This means that we must turn our lights on and off at these given ratios. During pre - flowering you will either manually tu rn on your lights for 12 hours and"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" 211 _________________________________________________________________________________________ turn off your light for 12 hours everyday or you will use an automatic timer. If your light comes with a timer set the timer to do this. Throughout the 12 hours of darkness it is best to keep your grow area as dark a possible. A small desk light at the oth er side of your room will cause your plant not to react properly to 12/12 which will result in continued vegetative growth. In f act any light that penetrates the darkness will stop your plants from flowering properly. That means that your grow room must be sealed to the point where it is completely light proof. If you want to learn how to do this perfectly then I suggest that you read up on 'Photography Dark Rooms', either on the Internet or in your local library. Photographers use common items that can be bought in most hardware shops to make their film - processing rooms light tight. If you can replicate their ideas (basically a thick black screening around the doorframes or any open light points) then you will have a great system for flowering plants in.

Problems with 12/12 If you switch to 12/12 before pre - flowers have show n then you may encounter the following problems. - Stress related sex problems (Hermaphrodites). - Abnormal bud growth. Str ess related sex problems MIGHT produce hermaphrodite plants. The stress of what is sometimes called \"early flowering\" (it is not really early flowering, there is no such thing as early flowering. We will explain this in a moment) triggers the plant into a situation where it thinks that its chances of reproduction are slim to none. That situation is a condition called - ' self - pollin ation '. It does this by producing both male and female flowers on the same plant. The male flowers then pollinate the female flo wers which will eventually produce seeds. The reason for this is that the plant notices that the photoperiod is irregular and th at it should no longer be in"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":" 213 _________________________________________________________________________________________ the vegetative cycle but in flowering. This shocks the plant into a last ditch effort to receive pollen because it feels that it has missed its chance to receive pollen already (in the wild males release their pollen just around the time that females begin to flower and sometimes even before that).

If you have ever seen all female seeds been adv ertised by seed - banks then you should have the right to know that these seeds come from female plants which are stressed into pr oducing male flowers. The plants then self - pollinate themselves and the results are female and hermaphrodite seeds. In a special case a female known as an XX female will produce more female seeds than hermaphrodite seeds. That is how female seeds are creat ed. In general growers try to keep away from any hermie plants because they will spoil a Sinsemilla crop. Also having pollen floating around in your grow room from a hermie plant will spoil everything else including breeding projects. Abnormal bud g rowth is a side effect of this.

Early induced flowering is not technically forcing your plant to flower. If you force flower on one strain that h as not pre - flowered it will flower at roughly the same time as an exact copy of the same strain which has been flowered only whe n the pre - flowers appear naturally. Force flowering simply acts by stressing the plant into a crisis condition. Get the bes t out of your plant and wait until your plant starts pre - flowering before switching to 12/12.

The three most common new types of indoor growing are SOG, ScrOG and Cabinet growin g. These are basically ways to grow seriously large top colas. These methods do not have to be soil based, one can use hydropo nics instead but soil is generally the most widely used medium with these set - ups. The idea behind these methods is that the bottom branches of indoor cannabis plants do not catch much of the light cast from the HID and are not that good to smoke either because they are fan leaves. So why not create an apparatus that concentrates on the top part of the plant. In most cases the c ola, is going to produce the most bud so why not try to get that part of the plant to grow really big.

First of all you need to grow some plants normal ly first. Wait until you see flowers and then select the nicest female you can find. Take cuttings from this female mother plant and grow the cuttings out until they have roots. When you do take multiple cuttings try create as many plants as you can fit in to your grow set - up. In SOG grows we are looking a 1 plant per square foot or even one plant per 0.10 square feet. So that shoul d be a good estimate as to how many clones you will need. Now, we want to look at pots here first. What we really need are tube shaped pots or pots that have a longer depth than width. You can make these yourself or buy these pots in the store. All we want to do is pack in as many pots with plants as we can into the SOG grow chamber. It is just a big cluster of pots with clones. Th e clones are planted all at the same time. No more new plants are introduced into the SOG grow room. When they have reached your desired height (keep it small), they should be flowered. Because the clones have been taken from a mother plant, the clones wil l carry the age of the mother plant with them. Since we took them from a flowering mother they will start to flower as soon as w e start 12/12. The final harvest result will be a full canopy of bud, hence the name Sea Of Green.

This is like a SOG (Sea of Green) grow, but a screen is used to train the plant to g row horizontally creating a canopy of buds beneath the light. The screen is simply 2â chicken wire, or 2â nylon poultry fencing, or one can use hooks and 20 lb. fishing line to make their net. The screen is at a set height above the plant medium. This he ight varies from 8â to 24â depending on the size light used to grow with. The light should be hung by chains and adjustable so t hat one can raise it if needed.

One should allow at least 1 square foot per flowering plant in a ScrO G grow. This method also takes anywhere from 1 to 3 weeks longer per grow because we will be in a vegetative stage longer tha n a SOG grow. The plants are trained to grow horizontally under the screen until they are 2 weeks into the flowering cycle. At this point you let the tops grow vertically through the screen. One should always train the main growing tops to the outside of the screen. They always grow the tallest, and we want the tallest to be on the perimeter of the screen. As the tops grow vertically, push the large fan leaves down under the screen, allowing the light to get to all the developing bud sites. If leaf growth is excessive, one should first cut the finger in half making a shorter leaf and allowing light to get to the bud site. Le aving half the leaf on the plant still allows it to make energy for the plant to grow. Taking a whole fan leaf away in one go ca n stunt growth. In a week take off the rest of it.

Just remember to remove a little at a time if you do remove leaf. At th is point flowers are forming and growing vertically creating a carpet of bud above the screen. Now we go below the screen and re move all the lateral branches and stray bud sites. The canopy has thickened up enough now that light is blocked from reaching th is lower growth. It is only sucking away your plantâs energy from the buds under the light. Remove all branches that have not ma de it to the screen and the stray bud sites. We want the plant to concentrate all itâs grow energy on the developing flowers abo ve the canopy. The main 3 differences between a SOG and ScrOG grow is the number of plants grown, the screen, and the slightly longer grow cycle of the ScrOG. Both methods can be done under the same light and in soil or with hydroponics. There are many v ariations of the ScrOG grow, but they all contain the same principles. There are the V - ScrOG, Stadium ScrOG, Flat ScrOG, and the Cylinder ScrOG grows in todayâs homes. I think you can picture what these look like.

A cabinet can be your hot press, small closet, an old refrigerator , a box, a press, or a simple cupboard will do. The grow area is usually small and can accommodate 1 to 4 plants at a time. The idea behind a cabinet grow (Figure 8.4) is to keep a cycle of plants growing at all times. There are three things a cabinet need s to get started, and these are: - The Cabinet - A Light - An air vent with fan. Most people simply set up their lights so that it is adjustable.

The intake hole is on opposite side of grow area and can have a fan in it also. This fan is generally moving a bit quicker than the extractor fan to allow a fresh supply of air to circulate before leaving th e grow room. The walls are painted flat white or Mylar is hung for reflective purposes. The plants are usually placed in separ ate pots and go through their entire life cycle within the cabinet environment. Clones are taken from the plants and placed eith er on a second shelf in the cabinet or near a window in your house. Some people have made a small compartment in their cabinet f or clones and germination. This can be any size, but is kept small because you only want to just keep the clones alive. This sma ll compartment will probably have one or two fluorescent lights in it for the clones. It would be best to keep the compartment a t the top of the grow chamber near the exhaust fan. You do not need an intake fan for these clones unless it is a big set - up. A simple hole in the side will allow the plants to breathe.

The room will become an intense hobby area and a most rewarding one too.

During most investigations they found that the roots did not respond too well to the mediums, but that the plant was receiving nutrition in every aspect when the nutrients were added to the artifi cial medium by hand. To solve this problem the inventors looked back into the history of growing. They found that many Ancient C ivilizations where growing their plants directly in running streams. A light reed or bush was used to keep the plants stems abov e the rushing water. Of course the inventors knew that only certain types of plants could be grown this way.

Hydroponics is the technique of growing plants without soil, but rather in beds of sand, gravel, or ar tificial mediums that are flooded with a nutrient solution. Basically a simple hydroponics system consists of a pot, a reserv oir, a grow medium, a pump and a set of growth nutrients. The system itself has a top layer and a lower layer, The top layer hol ds the grow medium and the bottom layer holds the water with added nutrients. The plant is grown in the medium where it will dev elop a stem and a set of roots. The roots will grow through the medium and down into the nutrient solution. Water and nutrients are pumped into the lower portion of the tank through a reservoir at certain timed intervals. The plants drink the solution down and thus exposes their roots to the air more.

Now having sai d this, hydroponically grown plants produce massive root clusters and I mean a big mass of roots. One can easily pick up a 2 - g allon bucket full of root growth from a single plant! This is because roots thrive in hydroponics systems. Hydroponics has beco me a fast growing trend in cannabis cultivation. It does require a certain degree of maintenance, but the results are sometimes incredible. On the other hand if a hydroponics system is not well maintained the whole unit may fail and kill your plants very quickly. This is the biggest problem that the hydroponics grower has to contend with. Hydroponics, when done correctly, can produce a flowering plant up to 3/4 the normal time that it would take with a soil grow. That is right! Hydroponics can grow big ger and better buds in 3/4 the time it takes to grow the same strain in soil.

Your mix and the choice of nu trients will depend on whether your plant will die, grow, grow big, or grow very very big. Nutrient solutions basically come i n a number of different forms. It is vital to check that the solution you use is the best for your type of plant. Some solutions are for soil and can only be used with soil. They contain the wrong elements for hydroponics use. There are soil - based suppleme nts/fertilizers and then there are hydroponics nutrients. Most hydroponics nutrient solutions are complete nutrient solutions. They provide every element and compound needed for proper plant growth. Because of this hydroponics nutrients are a bit steep i n price. Always spend your money on the correct nutrients because any short cuts will lead to failure and kill your"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":" 259 _________________________________________________________________________________________ plant. Single Packs: If all the nutrients are contained in a single pack there is a chance that the elements may combine and precipitate in the pack. This may cause the solution to become unbalanced and is then rendered useless to you and your plants. Keeping this in mind, get a complete nutrient solution that is contained in several bottles called âTwinâ or âTriple pac ksâ. One brand name called Formulex has managed to hold all the elements in a single pack using certain chemicals to prevent p recipitation. This pack is very good for starting clones or seeds in a rockwool SBS tray. Formulex can be used in soil grows als o. "},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":" 260 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Figure 9.12 - Formulex Twin / Triple Packs: Figure 9.13 - This is an example of triple pack nutrients. For best results the hydroponics grower should consider a Twin or even a Triple pack."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":" 261 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Basically the chemicals are held in different packs to prevent precipitation. Optimum, Power Gro, Ionic, and General hydroponics Flora Series are the most common multi part nutrient solutions. The most popular one with cannabis cultivation is the G.H. Flor a Series, a 3 - part system, Gro, Micro, and Bloom. An experienced grower can adjust these nutrients to get optimum performance fr om their plants. These packs have instructions on the bottles explaining how to mix down the nutrients into water, and can be broken down and mixed weaker or stronger to the grower's needs. MONITORING RECYCLE SYSTEMS Depending on what set - up you ar e using, you may find that your solution goes through a system that uses the nutrients in the reservoir over and over. As the pl ant extracts the nutrients and minerals from the solution it will become depleted of its resources over time. For this reason we must understand how to monitor our nutrients. In today's world monitoring systems are a bit expensive. If you have a ppm reader (TDS meter, Total Dissolved"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":" 262 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Solids) you can understand how much of your nutrients have been used up and how much more you need to add to reach the optimal n utrient level. All reservoirs will become unbalanced and need replenishing. As a general rule, an initial amount is used to fill the reservoir. As the plants use up the solution, we top up the reservoir to maintain the initial level. If you start with 10 gallons of solution then we need to top up to that total of 10 gallons every few days. Figure 9.14 - Ppm reader (TDS meter) . "},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":" 263 _________________________________________________________________________________________ If you do not have a reader you can still grow a good crop, but it takes practice to get it right. If a cannabis hydroponics gr ower does not have a ppm reader, then they tend to replace the reservoir more often instead of topping it up. That way the growe r is certain that the new solution will contain everything the plant needs. If you have a ppm reader then you only need to top o ff the reservoir as needed. PPM (parts per millionth) readers can be expensive, but over time they will help you save money on t he cost of hydroponics nutrients. HYDROPONICS GROWING MEDIUMS There are many hydroponics mediums to use that your plant will take root in. Rockwool appears to be the most popular and comes in either slabs or cubes. These cubes vary in sizes from 1\" to 6\" cubes. The slabs can be cut to suite the shape of your pot or container. Rockwool: Many growers like to use the cubes for seed germination and for rooting cuttings. This"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":" 264 _________________________________________________________________________________________ seems to be the easiest to use. Many growers claim that rockwool should be pre soaked for 24 hrs in water with a pH level of 5.6 . This is to stabilize the pH level of the rockwool. How to make up nutrient solutions: Always follow the very simple ins tructions on the products. All you need is a container to make up the nutrients in and the nutrients themselves. Each of the pac ks should have A, B, and C written on them. The mixture is usually 3.5mls of A and B and C per litre of water. This is called a 100% strength mixture if you follow the guidelines as stated exactly on the label. Hydroponics pH: After you have mixed up y our nutrient solution you will want to take a pH reading of it. If you have any problems, just like in soil growing, you will ne ed to adjust your pH level. Now, you do not use the same method to adjust pH levels as described in the soil chapter.

These are cheap and can be added to your solution to balance the pH level. NOTE: Cannabis plants in a so il systems like a pH of 7, but in hydroponics systems they like a pH of 5.2 to 6.3. You will discover it is easier to maintain a pH range and not a set level. Figure 9.15 pH up and pH down products for hydroponics use. "},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":" 266 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Always check your hydroponics pH level as often as you can. pH can slip up and down very quickly in hydroponics systems. Alga: Alga is part of a large group of non - vascular mainly aquatic cryptogams capable of photosynthesis. Always keep your contain er away from exposure to direct light, as alga will grow in the container if you do not. This seems to be something of a problem because we grow plants under lights and we may have a system that has to be sitting near the light so the plants can grow prope rly. Most hydroponics systems have been manufactured âlight tightâ to eliminate this problem. If you built your own system then you may want to keep your solution sealed from the light by using thick black PVC tape to cover the lid and the entire reservoir . This will help prevent alga from growing in your system. If you do have alga growth then you need to clean your system out.

Using a thick black garbage bag works well to keep the light out. Grow and Bloom: Some of the double packs come in two different sets - Grow and Bloom. Basically the Grow solution is used during the plants vegetative stage and the Bloom is used during the flowering stage. The Bloom formulas contain more Phosphorus and Potassium and less Nitrogen. Other packs have a complete all in one function, but they are lacking some additional extras. Cannabis may find a lot of the nutrients that are mixed full strength to be too strong and it will burn them. It is recommen ded that when using any hydroponics formulations with cannabis that you do so in MODERATION for your first grow. Many cannabis g rowers have bought these products with anticipation of producing great buds only to get great plant burns instead. It is best to start off with 30% strength at first and then increase if needed."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" 268 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Strengths: Marijuana cultivators have found that full strength nutrient solutions are not a good thing. In fact even medium s trength formulas have the power to burn your plants. Consult the information on the packs, but in general 3.5 mls of A and B and C per litre is usually called 100% strength. The same amount mixed with 2 litres of water is 50% strength. Marijuana can grow v ery well between 30% and 50%. Never go full strength with your nutrients if this is your first time. Try 30% for the first attem pt and see how your plants do. You will be surprised at how rich a bud content you will produce with this amount of nutrients. T he most common problem associated with hydroponics is plant burns. I have rarely heard of someone under - feeding his or her plant s in a hydro system. I have heard plenty of reports about overfeeding plants in hydro systems. Over time you will get to know yo ur strain and what it likes.

Scale is caused by very acidic pH levels. Your local water company will provide you with a read out of your water. You can buy nutrient products to use with hard water.

A top up can be done if you do not want to change the reservoir totally. If you do not have a PPM meter to calculate this accurately, simply write down your nutrients mix ratio from day 1.

Now the plant has drunk 1/2 a litre, now all you need to do is make another litre of 3.5ml mix in another contain er and add 1/2 of it to the reservoir.

Seeds that are planted in untreated ground will have a low g ermination rate. Also you need to think about when to grow.

Amazing or what! You will have all female outdoor plants! It is also a good idea around the second week of vegetative growth to spray the area with some pesticide. Cannabis growing is really fun because the more you know, the more tricks you will invent by yourself to get the most out of your yields. Some of the best cannabis growers are very exotic w ith their grow methods. A number of people have even tried outdoor hydroponics to get their plants to grow bigger and better. W hen growing outdoors you need to keep your plants in good shape and free from any unwanted predators that may find your top cola and leaves to be quite tasty. We will talk about this in the chapter about pests. CARING FOR OUTDOOR PLANTS Weeding: The be st way to weed is buy hand.

Some weed killers say that they will protect"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":" 283 _________________________________________________________________________________________ your plant and only kill the weeds around but this is not very agreeable with marijuana plants. If you want to test weed killers then it is suggested that you may create a small patch with one clone to see how the weed killer reacts with it. For now, do yo ur weeding by hand. When you have weeded a grow area your plant will grow much better without having to worry about competition for light. Generally throughout the plants grow cycle you will have to weed the patch every week for the first 2 - 3 weeks and then once every month until as such time as the competition has been left truly and well behind. Some grow areas may be weed fre e in March, but come June the area may not seem like it has been weeded at all because of the speed of weed growth. Whenever you visit your plants make sure you pull up a few weeds as it does help. If you feel that your area is very dense with weeds then you may consider a ground cover. A ground cover is basically a cover that is placed on the ground with holes in it that the mari juana plant grows up through. Covers can be anything from plastic bin liners to sheets of paper. Of course this does not look"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":" 284 _________________________________________________________________________________________ good if you want to create a stealth grow area, but it does keep the weeds down.

All your water should come from the heavens. If you find that you hav e a drought or a long warm spell during summer then you may wish to carry some water to your grow area. If you have to trek over long distances then it is suggested that you fill a sack with plastic bottles of water. Some garden growers use sprinkler sys tems during dry spells. This is great but again, may attract unwanted attention that you do not need. How much water your plan t needs depends on how big your plant is. Some larger plants will require a minimum of a gallon of water per day. Natural loam s oil will be able to hold water for anywhere between 4 - 6 weeks before becoming extremely dry under the sun. Deep pockets of wa ter may be held below the surface that would not be noticed by the grower on the surface. The best way to judge whether your pla nts need water or not is by the way they look.

If you want to really make sure that your plant has a water source underneath it, simply dig a small hole about a foot deep to the side of your plant but keep an eye out that you do not hit any major roots. Put your hand down inside the hole, does it feel dry? Or does it feel cool and moist? If it is c old and moist then the soil has stored some water below the surface. Your plants can drink this without problems. Figure 10.4 - Outdoor rooftop grow by Inf3cted.

From its vegetative cycle to its flowering cycle the cannabis pl ant develops in three most noticeable sections. The top cola, the mid - section and the base. The top cola will develop a large am ount of bud and generally is a very flower - full part of the plant. The mid - section contains bud and stems along with old and new leaves. This section will fill with buds that grow in between the nodes near the stem. Although these buds will generally be sm aller in size to the main cola they should be just as potent. The bottom section of your plant will contain the large fan leaves and a small amount of bud. Also towards the bottom of the plant you will see some dead leaves that are about to fall away and m ay look yellow. Once a grower knows about the plant's different sections they can treat each section"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":" 289 _________________________________________________________________________________________ to get the most out of their plant. The bottom fan leaves are generally not smoked and are used only to gather light for your pl ant. If your plant is growing under an artificial light source and you do not think that these fan leaves are receiving much lig ht then you may think about cutting them away. This is NOT a good idea. Fan leaves produce sugar that is used in bud production. If you cut away the fan leaves you may cause your bud growth to stunt causing you to finish up with a smaller harvest. Leave fa n leaves alone where and when you can. The only times when you should remove a fan leave is when it is either dying, badly bur nt or covering a large bud mass. In a SOG or a ScrOG set - up you may want to remove a fan leaf or two because it is covering the bud mass of another plant. Light is the probably the most important factor in bud development and if the fan leaf is preventing light from reaching the bud, then you may want to remove it. You should remove any dead leaves from the bottom of your plant a nd throw them away. Never leave the dead leaves on your soil as a fertilizer. These dead leaves tend to attract unwanted pests."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":" 290 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Thinning: This really only applies to outdoor growers, but some indoor set - ups such as ScrOG, SOG and BOG may need to be thi nned. Growers like to grow their plants in a uniform condition. That is - growers like all their plants to be the same height. That way we perfectly arrange our light so that it is too far away or close to the tops. If one plant is racy then we would have to adjust the light to suite that plant. This means that we may end up with light gaps like the following. - Distance from Plan t A to light is 1 meter. - Distance from Plant B to light is 0.5 meters. - Distance from plant C to light is 8 inches. In this c ase you could imagine the plants in a slope shape in there grow environment. Obviously we are going to be wasting light, not to mention space on this set - up so we need to prevent this slope from happening. That is where thinning comes into play. The reas on for the slope or curve is because"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":" 291 _________________________________________________________________________________________ some plants might tend to be a bit racy. Some of the plants will try to grow quicker than others to try and receive more light. If this happens the racy plant will cause the smaller ones beside it to receive less light. To control racy plants we use a proc ess called thinning. If you discover a few racy plants then just cut them down to the same level as the others (called pruning) or remove them all together. Once you have done this you will see all your plants growing nicely along at the same level. Now, do not throw away the cuttings from the thinning before you read the next line. You can clone these cuttings into new plants! By the time you have finished your thinning you will have an even grow area with some clones that you can use to grow more bud. Now the other thing to remember is that some people may tend to thin the other way round. That is - leaving the taller ones an d remove the smaller ones. Again in Cannabis growing the taller plants are generally male and the smaller ones are female if you have started from seed. Do you want a garden full of possible males? During the thinning process you may want to"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":" 292 _________________________________________________________________________________________ tackle some dead leaves or leaves that have some mould build up on them. Mould looks like a rust or fluff on the leaves and will most of the time spread to other parts of the plant. So why not cut these away too while you thin your grow area. Thinning you r grow makes it look nicer and tidier and helps to improve your overall yield. Light Bending: Light bending occurs when a pl ant tries to grow at an angle towards the light. You may have seen some of the outside plants in your grow area bending towards the light to try and get their share. If your plants bend too much they will eventually grow towards (or even into) another plan t. This is not good as they will cover other plants. Also during flowering the buds can get heavy and may cause your plant and p ot to fall over. To avoid light bending simply switch your plants around from day to day. If a plant leans too much one way, the n take it towards the middle of the pack or turn the plant around. It only takes a day or two for the plant to bend back straigh t again. If your plants can not be moved, such as in the"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":" 293 _________________________________________________________________________________________ case of hydroponics in conjunction with a ScrOG grow, then you may have to tie your plants up so that they do not bend. Figu re 11.1 - Here is an example of some tied up buds. If you are outdoors and you have a massive problem with this then you may have to cut away some surrounding foliage to allow more light to get in at your plants. If you can not do this then try to use a small stake and thread, such as bamboo, to keep your plant upright. Remember"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":" 294 _________________________________________________________________________________________ that if your plants are bending then they are trying to tell you something. They need more direct light! Pruning: Many a mari juana cultivator have taken a pair of clippers to the top of their plant just above the last branch formation during the 3rd or 4th week of vegetative growth. The top is removed by shearing it away at the stem. This can also be done during the thinning sta ges. What happens next is that the main stem may split off in two or more directions. This creates a V shape at the top of your plant. The end results after flowering are two or more top colas instead of one. Now, many a cannabis grower will tell you that this is a great thing to do and sometimes it is. Two top colas instead of one does sound appealing but alas it must be said that this TOPPING method of pruning does not always work out the way you think it will.

As you can see the main stem has been clip ped to produce 2 new stems. Picture by Strawdog. Sometimes the plant will produce two small top colas instead of two big ones. This really depends on the strain and the environment. Many a grower have managed to bring a plant into growing more than six t op colas by this method. Each strain will have a threshold for bud production, which can not be improved on. Some plants when gr own fully without pruning do not reach their threshold. The strain Blueberry is"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":" 298 _________________________________________________________________________________________ a good example of this. If you grow blueberry without topping you will not achieve maximum bud production from that plant, but i f you do top the blueberry you will. Other strains are not so flexible and by topping you will not increase bud production. The two top colas will simply be sharing the same volume of bud that a single cola would have produced on the same strain. So prunin g for production is strain related and grow related. You need to find a strain that responds well to topping. It is advised t hat you experiment with this pruning method. Do this with 2 out of 10 females with every grow you do. You will find in time that during this vegetative prune you will be able to shape your plant. Plants are generally pruned 3 - 4 weeks into their vegetativ e cycle but can be pruned sooner or later or more than once. Pruning during flowering will cause problems with bud production be cause the plant will divert its energy from bud production into branch and leaf production. The results will be a slower rate of Bud growth. Remember how we spoke about Indica plants being small and Sativa plants being tall. Well"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":" 299 _________________________________________________________________________________________ if you learn to prune your plant right you can generate small bushy Sativa plants that grow in tiny spaces. Without pruning the Sativa plant it will probably stretch to five feet and more. For every stem or branch you prune, the cut area will develop two more branches. Look outside at any tree. See how the stem divides into branches which sub - divide into more branches which divid e into new shoots and leaves. Well some marijuana plant only grow a main branch out from the stem and this may stay that way thr oughout its entire grow. Any filling out usually occurs when new leaves and branches develop at the nodes. Some lateral branches may develop new shoots but these are somewhat small and thin and do not support much bud growth. If we prune our plant we can m ake it more like the tree that we see in the garden. There is also a limit to how much we can prune. Let us follow a prune path for a moment. If we prune the stem, it will split into two. We can prune both these two new stems and end up with four stems. W e may try to prune each of these four stems to try and create eight stems, but this depends on the strain and its branching limi t which is genetically based."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":" 300 _________________________________________________________________________________________ We may be able to prune some of the lateral branches but again if the plant has reached it threshold it will not produce more ne w branches. All strains are different in this respect. Prune cuts are made using clippers at a 45 - degree angle to the shoot bei ng cut. Bushes: Some people like to keep their plants small and wide. Cannabis plants are great for making bushes with. It is a simple process. During the 3rd week of vegetative growth prune half the plants branches and leave the other half. Never remov e all the branches. Cannabis plants need at least 50% of the leaves to continue growing without stunting problems. If you go les s that 50% you may stunt your plant. Do not prune just one side of the plant. Prune per side to achieve the 50%. You may also p rune the main top cola if you wish the cola to split into two or more parts. Wait until the 4th of 5th week of vegetative growt h and prune the other half. (Only do this if the prune cuts you previously made have grown new branches and leaves.)"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":" 301 _________________________________________________________________________________________ During the seventh week of vegetative growth you will notice that your plant has become more concerned with growing outwards than with growing upwards. Let us pretend that we have a plant with 8 shoots. That means it is 4 nodes high. We perform our pru ning as described and we end up with 16 shoots, but our plant is still 4 nodes high. Now this does not mean that we can keep dou bling our shoots forever. Pruning just pushes the plant to grow all its shoots early. If you keep pruning up until the eighth we ek of vegetative growth with a plant that is 4 nodes high, the most amount of shoots you will get will be about 32. They do not really go beyond this factor much, but again this is strain dependent. Now each new shoot has a junction point or a node that it grew out from. Each node should produce some bud during the flowering stages. It is more than possible to create a marijuana pl ant that droops down over the sides hiding the pot. Not only that but different strains grow in different sizes. It is more than possible, with the right strain, to have a single plant cover an entire desk using this method.

Training is simply the art of tyi ng down your plants main stem so that it grows in a âSâ shape pattern. Mainly this is used to prevent plants from reaching their natural height without pruning (although you can also prune trained plants without a problem). Training is done by simply atta ching a piece of thread to the stem and bending the plant over. The thread is then locked down to either another part of the ste m or a piece of the grow room frame. People have managed to grow all kinds of shaped plants using this method - from corkscrew s hapes to complete full circles. Some growers even like to grow their plants horizontally across during the vegetative stage of g rowth. During the flowering cycle the light is moved above the plant to encourage thicker bud growth along the main stem. Someti mes this method does not work so well, but when it does the overall bud production can be excellent.

Applying honey to the wound also has its benefits. If you rub honey into the wound the plant should be able to heal itself a bit quicker.

CLEANING THE GROW ROOM It does happen that sometimes the bugs win. No matter how much you might spray them or try to kill them, they keep coming back to your grow room. To solve this you will have to create a clean room, which means a total and complete cull of your harvest. First set - up another grow room of smaller size. Enough to support some cuttings and clones. Take cuttings from what plants you have and move the cuttings to that room. You wil l use the cuttings again eventually in your clean grow room if you want to continue those strains. Next up take all the grow eq uipment, bar electrical equipment, to the bathroom.

You will maybe have to paint them agai n after. Do the corners, up high and clean out any holes, extraction holes, fittings, pipes, etc. Then clean around the rim of t he room. If your floor can be lifted up, then you can also do this to get in at the corners a bit better. After this cleaning has been done you can consider smoking the room. Various pest killing smoke bombs can be bought in most grow stores. Follow the instructions carefully and smoke bomb the room. This will guarantee the demise of any bugs, eggs or larvae but remember eggs are usually safe from these sprays, that is why they recommend a reapplication 7 - 10 days after initial treatment - MAKE SURE TO READ THE LABELS!!!!!

If common sense does not solve it then it sounds like y ou have a feeding problem and want to know how to sort it out. Well this is what this chapter is all about. PLANT NUTRIENT / C HEMICAL PROBLEMS AND HOW TO SOLVE THEM. Before we begin we should tell you what a chemical burn is. A chemical burn is what the plant suffers because of over - feeding. A chemical burn can be compared to a half - smoked joint. At the tip of the joint you have this shrivelled grey ash, in the middle you have the burn creeping towards new paper which leaves a pattern behind it, and then you have the part you have not smoked yet. A plant burn looks like this almost. The plant sucks up the water and the food. It distributes these elements to the leaves at the bottom first and then works it way up the plant. This process takes days to w ork as you know FROM WATERING and WHEN TO WATER! The damage starts at the tips of the leaf and slowly moves to the centre of the leaf, leaving behind it some crispy matter that"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":" 329 _________________________________________________________________________________________ flakes away between your fingers. This is what a chemical burn looks like. A nutrient problem does not look burnt. A nutrient pr oblem looks like a cell collapse with discoloration. The part may wither and die, but it should not look burnt. That is major di fference between a chemical burn and a nutrient problem. In time you should be able to tell the difference for yourself. A lso check your pH. If your pH is not right, then solve the pH problem before you go and do anything else. A) Look at your probl em and quickly search for any bugs. When you have completed this search, eliminate any bug problems by using the advice in the b ug chapter. Also note the type of attack to make sure that it is not a bug problem AND is a nutrient problem, which can happen. Do your leaves look sucked and dry? Do you have any black dots on them like bugs? Try to tell the difference between a bug attac k and a nutrient problem. Nutrient problems damage the plant on a somewhat consistent level. Bug attacks are less consistent in the damaged generated. They leave damaged patches everywhere on your plant. If the problem seems to affects only the lower po rtion of your plant and or a bit of the middle then read B). If it is only effects the top of your plant and the tips then you s hould go to J). If the plant is covered with the problem then go to F). B) If your plant is in vegetative growth and"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":" 330 _________________________________________________________________________________________ the leaves are going very yellow, then you need more Nitrogen. If your plant is in flowering and you have stunted growth, yellow leaves and it looks to be dying then you need more Nitrogen. If your plant is in flowering and does not look like it is dying b ut looks red or dark green/yellow then you need to treat it with more P, which is Phosphorus. If these do not help then go to C. C) If your plant has leaves that are curling up, twisting and are going yellow then check to see if your light is burning the m or if the grow chamber has enough air circulation. If this is fine then you need to consider adding more Mg which is Magnesium to your plants. Epsom salts are good - 1/4 - 1/3 table spoon of Epsom salts to 3 gallons of water is fine. If you still have a problem go to D). D) If the tips of the leaves turn brown and curl slightly then you are looking at a K problem which is Potas sium problem. If not, move onto E.

This causes stress and a variety of problems. The only cure for this is a bigger pot. NUTRIENT LOCKOUT Well...what can we say causes this..Hmm there are a number of things. If you followed H) right then you shoul d not have this but we will explain it anyway. Lockout occurs when the plant can not get access to a nutrient or a group of nutr ients. This could be caused by the absence of nutrients (a deficiency) or by a chemical reaction in the medium/solution that cau ses a toxic substance to block the roots, or causes a chemical reaction that creates another substance that changes the chemical properties of the other nutrients.

Crap genetics do exist and people still buy them. The genetics may have mutations, warping, flowering problems, a weakness in them or poor germination rates that will sometimes cause nutrient symptoms to appear even though your nutrient problem does not exist.

First of all you should know that harvesting smells. It stinks up the place really quickly, so ke ep this in mind. Now you will have followed the guidelines that the breeder set forth with his or her seeds about the flowering times. At the end of the flowering time examine your bud. Keep what you see in mind because now you will be able to judge other plants to know if they are finished or not. You do not really need to know the breeder's flowering time if you have been able to understand and identify a bud that has reached maturity. Here are some things that help identify when to harvest. Some of these things do not appear on every strain though. - 50% to 70% of the pistils change colour. - Your plant stops producing crystals. - Your plant stops producing resin. - The fan leaves and lower leaves have turned"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":" 334 _________________________________________________________________________________________ yellow and are starting to drop off. - The smell has reached a peak. - Bud mass has not increased in the past few days. These are good indicators that your plant is now ready for harvest. There is only one sure way to harvest your plant and anything else is pretty much a variation of it. Also we must add that harvesting an Indica plant and a Sativa plant is slightly different . INDICA HARVEST Your 1 foot - 4 foot plant should he hacked at the base. The plant should then be hung upside down in a cool room, with no light and fresh air. Take a pair of clippers out and remove as much of the fan leaves as possible. Then remove th e secondary leaves and put these into a separate pile. Last but not least gather some trim from the bud. âTrimâ is the small leaves that are covered in resin. Now you have 4 different qualities of weed to choose from. The fan leaf will only be an okay s moke, the middle leaves a little better and the trim will be very good. The BUD is the PRIME stuff though"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":" 335 _________________________________________________________________________________________ and this will give you your best quality high! Leave the plant like this until a branch can break easily between your fingers. When it does you are ready to cure the Bud. SATIVA HARVEST This is much like the indica except the harvest itself may be qui te labour intensive. Outdoor growers like to grow Sativa plants which sometimes grow up as far as 12 feet carrying over 20 oz of bud sometimes. These plants are not harvested easily. You need a canvas spread or another medium that you can use to carry the bud in. The plant should be chopped at the base and spread out on the canvas. The canvas is then rolled up and tied down tight f or transport. Obviously if you have more than one plant then you might need more than one canvas sheet. The plant should then b e hung upside down in a cool room, with no light and fresh air. Because of the plants size and bushiness you may have to cut the branches and hang these up separately. Take a pair of clippers out and remove leaves and trim as suggested in the Indica Harves t section."},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":" 336 _________________________________________________________________________________________ It must be pointed out here that light degrades THC quantities. Your room does not have to be as light - proof as your grow room does during 12/12. Just don't expose your harvest to any direct light. FAN LEAVES, LEAVES AND TRIM These are cured by leavin g them dry on a flat surface, away from direct light and with plenty of fresh air. The leaves will dry up after 3 weeks and are easily smokable at that stage. Test them out to see what you liked and what you did not like. Another thing you could do with th e trim is to make some hash from it. We will talk about this in another chapter. Do not try to speed up your drying process with ovens or microwaves or heat. Let them dry out normally and you will cure yourself a much better smoke from the leaves. CURING As soon as the branches are brittle you should consider canning your bud. Canning is a great way to get the most from your bud . Find a"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":" 337 _________________________________________________________________________________________ can with a removable lid. The more cans you have the better. Using a pair of scissors, clip your bud from the branch and put it into the can. The branches and stem are not much good to you. They do contain THC, but only in small quantities. Most stem and b ranches go in the bin. Now take the can and place it a room or cupboard that is dark. Everyday open the lid for a few hours (6 hours is good) and then close the lid again. Also shake the bud around a bit every couple of days. This is the most common curin g technique out there and it does do its job well. Bud that is cured well smokes the best! I would give the canning process between 3 - 4 weeks before you should really sample your goods. 8 weeks old bud can smoke extremely well and year old bud is vin tage stuff but can loose potency. Fresh bud (8 weeks canned curing) is the pinnacle point of cured bud. After that some of the T HC cannabinoids change composition and become different cannabinoid compounds. Fresh bud is far better than aged bud. You may fi nd other curing processes out there, but canning does work wonders and is cheap to do.

Let's go the simple route first. We may want to produce seeds fro m our crop to continue a strain that we purchased or obtained. By breeding two plants we can produce seeds. You are breeding to continue a strain here but you will not completely replicate the plants again unless they are IBL (To be explained later), but y ou will generate seeds that contain most of the parentsâ features but maybe not all. Some of your offspring should be like the parents but other offspring will show different traits such as potency, colour and taste. MAKING SEEDS How easy is it to ma ke seeds? Well it is easy if you have healthy plants and a stable - growing environment. When your male plants"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":" 340 _________________________________________________________________________________________ burst their pollen in your grow room they will pollinate the female flowers. At the end of flowering the bud will contain seeds. The seeds should be darkish in colour. If they are white, then they are not viable and you harvested them too early. Wait until the end of flowering to get your seeds. Your seeds will be in with the bud. It takes quite a bit of time to sort them out from the bud. If you want to use the seeds in more than 2 years time store them in a freezer. Before that time storing them in a small film canister will work well enough. POLLEN Film canisters are a great place to store pollen in. You can save pollen i n a canister for the next harvest. Pollen can be stored in the freezer for around 18 months. The odds of having pollen keep thou gh are slim. Pollen is best used up to 6 months. The pollen can be extracted from the male flower as soon as the flowers are rea dy to open. You will see the male flower open out from its pod. It is best to gather pollen after it falls from the pod onto the leaves. Simply shake the pollen onto the female flowers to pollinate them."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":" 341 _________________________________________________________________________________________ SIMPLE BREEDING Want to breed your plants to make more seeds?

HOW TO CONTINUE A STRAIN THROUGH S EEDS So you bought $120 Silver Haze seeds and you want to make more seeds without any interference from another strain? That i s easy. Just make sure that the male plants and the female plants are together from only the same strain batch. Do not introduce another strain into the pack. If you only have Silver Haze in your grow room, then all you need are some males and females. By letting the males pollinate the females you will get Silver Haze seeds. But you will loose some of the features that the origina l parent plants had in the selection of offspring, unless the strain you got was an IBL."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":" 342 _________________________________________________________________________________________ HOW TO MAKE A SIMPLE HYBRID It is easy, just take a male plant from one strain and a female from the other. Say Big Bud and S kunk. The result will be BIG BUD X Skunk, but there will be differences in the pack. Some of the plants will lean more in the BI G BUD direction and some in the Skunk direction. Some variations that where not present in the parents may also appear (if the p arents where not both IBL). If you want to concentrate on creating more seeds so that they ONLY go in one direction (creating un iform plants) then you need to read more in this chapter. AN INTRODUCTION INTO BASIC GENETICS Genetics are somewhat difficu lt to understand at first so it is best if we give you a grounding in some of the breeding concepts mentioned in this chapter. We will start by first explaining what a couple of words mean. These words will appear throughout this chapter so it is best to define them at this point. "},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":" 343 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Genes: Each of the units of heredity which are transmitted from parent to offspring in gametes, usually as part of a chromosome , and control or determine a single characteristic in the offspring. [There are genes responsible for each feature of your plan t to be inherited, for leaf colour, stem structure, texture, smell, potency, etc.] Alleles: Any of a number of alternative fo rms of one gene. [For example the Gene for purple bud colour may have 2 forms, one for purple and one for dark red.] Homozygo us: An individual that has identical alleles at one or more genetic loci, which is not a heterozygote and so breeds true. [You r plant is to be said homozygous for one feature when it carries in its responsible gene pair the same gene twice, which means b oth genes of the gene pair are equal.] "},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":" 344 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Heterozygous: An individual having different alleles at one or more genetic loci. [Your plant is to be said heterozygous for on e feature when the genes of the responsible gene pair are unequal.] Phenotype: An organism distinguishable from others by observable features. [How your plant looks is the phenotype. It is the summary of all the features you can see on the outside o f your plant. It can also be smell and taste.] Genotype: The genetic constitution of an individual, esp. as distinguished fro m the phenotype; the whole of the genes in an individual or group. [How your plant looks like inside, which features it can pos sibly inherit - you can't see those - is called the genotype. It is the summary of all genetic information which your plant carr ies and can inherit to its offspring.] "},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":" 345 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Dominant: Of a gene or allele: expressed even when inherited from only one parent. Of a hereditary trait: controlled by such a gene; appearing in an individual to the exclusion of its allelic counterpart, when alleles for both are present. [A gene is sai d to be dominant when its effect can be seen in the phenotype of your plant. Only one dominant allele in the gene pair must be p resent to be seen in the phenotype of your plant]. Recessive: Of a gene, allele, or hereditary trait: perceptibly expressed on ly in homozygotes, being masked in heterozygotes by a dominant allele or trait. [A gene is called recessive when its effect can not be seen in the phenotype of your plant, when only one allelle is present. The same allelle must be present twice in the gen e pair if you can see its expression in the phenotype of your plant.] Locus: A position on a chromosome at which a particular gene is located. "},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":" 346 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Chromosome: A threadlike structure of nucleic acids and protein which carries a set of linked genes and occurs singly in prokar yotes and in characteristic numbers, usu. paired, in the cell nuclei of higher organisms. Gene Pairs All of life is made up of a pattern of genes. This pattern is similar to the two sides the zip on your jacket. One side is from the mother, the other i s from the father. Each \"gene locus\", a particular space on that chain, controls one bit of information about the eventual appea rance of the plant. Each gene locus contains 2 genes, one from the mother, one from the father. A pair of letters such as BB, B b, Pp, pp, etc generally notates these. Capital refers to dominant genes while lower case refers to recessive. B can Big bud whi le b can be smaller bud. This is just an example. The letters refer to a human beings imaginary reference for what a specific ge ne locus controls. Any letter can be assigned to it. "},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":" 347 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Dominant and Recessive Individual genes within a locus are said to be either dominant or recessive. This is noted by a capita l letter for a dominant gene and a lower case letter for a recessive gene. Dominant genes have a stronger effect and if only one is present, will win over the recessive gene in that locus. For example the B gene means the plant will produce big bud, whil e the b gene means the plant will produce small bud. Since B is dominant a plant with a Bb genotype will produce Big Bud. The B is dominant over the b. In order for a recessive gene to have an effect, both genes must be recessive, so BB is Big Bud, and Bb is Big Bud, but bb will be small bud. Modifying Genes. By breeding we can determine.. Letâs say... what the colour of the pla ntâs bud will be, or more importantly, what colour the offspring of two plants is going to look like. The final appearance howev er will be the result of more than one gene locus. Plants may have several colour genes for different parts of the plant. A plan tâs genetic structure is quite complex. "},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":" 348 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Partial Dominance Now that we have explained the basics of dominant and recessive, you can move on to the next step. Some g ene loci in plants have more than two possibilities. These are sometimes referred to as âpartially dominant genesâ and are usual ly given some type of secondary marker such as Bâ or B\". They work just like dominant and recessives except that there are mor e than two options. If a gene is dominant over another gene, it will win. Just like a dominant will win a recessive. Hardy - W einberg Equilibrium Introduction: An understanding of breeding concepts requires a basic understanding of Hardy - Weinbergâs E quilibrium. Breeding depends upon the knowledge of population genetics. To understand the value of the H/W Equilibrium, you may have to ask yourself a question like this before. If certain diseases are a dominant trait, then why havenât large sections of the"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":" 349 _________________________________________________________________________________________ population got this disease? The same question applies to cannabis breeding. If purple bud colour is a dominant trait then ho w come my offspring from the purple bud strain do not have purple buds? Or, I have been selecting Indica mothers and cross breed ing them with mostly Indica male plants but I have some sativa leaves. Why does this happen? Hardy - Weinbergâs Equilibrium will h elp you to understand these questions and there answers. Okay, first of all these questions reflect a very common misconceptio n. That misconception is that the dominant allele of a trait will always have the highest frequency in a population and the rece ssive allele will always have the lowest frequency. There is no logic behind the idea that a dominant trait should show a te ndency to spread over a whole population. Also there is no logic behind the idea that a recessive trait should die out. Gene f requencies can be in high ratios or low ratios no matter how the allele is expressed. The allele can also change, depending on c ertain conditions. It is the changes in gene frequencies over time that result in different plant characteristics. Hardy - Weinb erg Equilibrium will show us"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":" 350 _________________________________________________________________________________________ whether or not gene frequencies have changed in a population. A population is a group of individuals of the same strain or spe cies , [such as cannabis Indica or cannabis sativa (species), or Skunk#1 and Master Kush (strains of a species)], in a given area whose members can interbreed with one another . This means that they share a common group of genes. This common group of genes i s known as the GENE POOL. Each gene pool contains all the alleles for all the traits of all the population. For a step in evo lution to occur some of the gene frequencies must change. That is why we have different types of cannabis plants. The gene freq uency of an allele refers to the number of times an allele for a particular trait occurs compared to the total number of alleles for that trait. Gene frequency is calculated as follows. The number of a specific type of allele, divided by, The Total num ber of alleles in the gene pool. The Hardy and Weinberg principal describes a theoretical situation in which there is no chan ge in the gene pool. This means that there can be no evolution. "},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":" 351 _________________________________________________________________________________________ For a test example let us consider a population whose gene pool contains the alleles B and b. Assign the letter c to the frequ ency of the dominant allele B and the letter d to the frequency of the recessive allele b. [In most cases you will find that c and d are actually notated as p and q by convention in science, but for this example we will use c and d.] The sum of all the alleles must equal 100%. So c + d = 1. All the random possible combinations of the members of a population would equal (c x c) + 2cd + (d x d). Which can also be expressed as: (c+d) X (c+d) We will explain this in detail in moment, but it is best t o know it for now. The frequencies of B and b will remain unchanged generation after generation if: 1. The population is large enough. 2. There are no mutations. 3. There are no preferences. For example a BB male does not prefer a bb female by its nat ure."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":" 352 _________________________________________________________________________________________ 4. No other outside population exchanges genes with this model. 5. Natural selection must not favour any specific individual. Let us imagine a pool of genes. 12 are B and 18 are b. Now remember The sum of all the alleles must equal 100%. So this means that the total in this case is 12 + 18 = 30. So 30 is 100%. If we want to find the frequencies of B and b and the genotypic f requencies of B, Bb and b then we will have to apply the standard formula that we have just been shown. f (B) = 12/30 = 0.4 = 4 0% f (b) = 18/30 = 0.6 = 60% Both add to make 100%. Now we know their ratios. So, c + d = 0.4 + 0.6 = 1 We have proven that c + d must equal 1. Very straightforward, yes."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":" 353 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Remember that all the random possible combinations of the members of a population would equal (c x c) + 2cd + (d x d), or (c+d) X (c+d) Then, c + d = 0.4 + 0.6 = 1 And (c x c) + 2cd + (d x d) = BB + Bb + bb = .24 + .48 + .30 = 1 This means that the population can increase in size, but the frequencies of B and b will stay the same. Now, suppose we break the 4th law abou t not introducing another population into this one. Let us say that we add 4 more b. b + b + b + b enter the pool. This brin gs our total up to 34 instead of 30. What will the gene and genotypic frequencies be?

This means that the Equilibrium law fails if the 4th law is not met. When the new genes entered the pool it resulted in a ch ange of the populationâs gene frequencies. However if no other populations where introduced then the frequency of .42 would be m aintained generation after generation. However we would like to point out that we used a very small pool in the above example. If the pool were much larger then the number of changes, even if one or two new genes jumped in, would be insignificant. You co uld calculate it, but the change would be on an extremely low level 0.000000000001 of a difference in reality. This is just as basic example to get you started. It may not make complete sense at first but if you read on then it will fall into place. Some of you may be asking the question.

If you have been given seeds or a clone you may have been told that a trait, such potency is H omozygous Dominant, Heterozygous or Homozygous Recessive. However, you will want to prove this to yourself. Especially if you ar e going to use that plant in a future breeding plan. You will have to do what is called a Test Cross. THE TEST CROSS Determin ing the phenotype of a plant is fairly straightforward. You look at the plant and you see its phenotype. Determining the genotyp e can not be done through visible observation alone. The genes themselves are somewhat hidden except for their visible related p henotypes. Again there are three possible genotypes that the plant can create. Letâs say golden bud is dominant and silver bud is recessive. Here is the table. Homozygous Dominant: BB = Golden Bud. Heterozygous: Bb = Golden Bud Homozygous Recessive: bb = Silver Bud. (The Golden and Silver bud colours are the phenotype. The b and B are genotype notations.)"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":" 356 _________________________________________________________________________________________ The reason why Bb is golden and not silver is because B dominates b. Most phenotypes are observed characteristics but some things like bud taste are also phenotypes that can not be observed. If we look at a Mostly Sativa species like a Haze plant we will notice that it is pale green. Now in a population of Haze plants we may notice that the one or two out of one hundred maybe dark green and not pale green. This suggests that the pale green colour is recessive. We are not totally sure until we have com pleted the test but the gene frequencies suggest this. We may also notice that the bud is golden on most of the plants so this s uggests that the golden bud colour is a dominant trait. Some of the buds on only a few of the plants may be silver. This suggest s that silver trait is Recessive (bb in our example). We know that the only genotype that produces the recessive trait is homozygous recessive (bb). So if a plant shows a recessive trait in its phenotype, its genotype is probably homozygous recess ive. A plant with a recessive trait always has a homozygous recessive genotype. "},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":" 357 _________________________________________________________________________________________ But this leaves us with a problem. Is the Golden bud or pale green leaf colour a Homozygous Dominant (BB) or is it Heterozygous (Bb). So now is the time to perform the Test Cross. Any test cross is a cross of an organism with an unknown dominant genotyp e (like in our case) with an organism that is homozygous recessive for that same trait. To do this test we need another cannab is plant of the opposite sex that is homozygous recessive (bb) for the same trait . So we will stick with bud colour as our examp le. Hey, we have a few silver bud plants around that we think are recessive. Letâs use them and see what happens. We pollinate t he female plant (Does not matter if the female is dominant or recessive one), and we get our seeds and plant them. 3 - 7 months later we see the results. This brings us to the next important rule that we will learn. If any of the offspring from a test c ross have the recessive trait, the genotype of the parent with the dominant trait must be Heterozygous. We will explain why i n a moment and this will all make sense to you. Also we must mention that we should be talking about a large population here. 10 00 plants is a good"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":" 358 _________________________________________________________________________________________ population to be sure with. 100 plants are good but 20 or less can be dodgy. The more plants we use the more reliable our res ults will be. In our example, our unknown genotype is either BB or Bb. The Silver genotype is bb. Let's put this information into a mathematical series known as Punnett Squares. We start by first putting in out known genotypes (above). We only do these calculations for 2 parents that will breed.

Half out offspring will have sil ver bud! The ration is 50:50. The second possibility tells us a number of things. (1) Both parents need at least one b trait each for the silver bud to pass on if it is a recessive trait. (2) If any silver bud is produced in the offspring then the myst ery parent B? must be Bb. It can not be BB. Remember: Homozygous Dominant: BB = Golden Bud. Heterozygous: Bb = Golden Bud Ho mozygous Recessive: bb = Silver Bud.

And this is your first step into the wo rld of breeding because: (1) When you breed plants you want to continue a trait. Something that you like to see on your plant o r taste with your plant or the height of your plant. (2) When you want to continue that trait you must know if it is Homozygous Dominant, Heterozygous or Homozygous Recessive. (3) You can find that out by running a test cross.

So if we where given two parents that displayed golden bud but where BOTH heterozygous for that trait Bb, we would also produce offspring that have silver bud.

When we have a strain that we want to keep, how do we k now that the parts we want to keep will actually be kept in our breeding process? This is where the test cross comes in. If we create seeds from a strain that we bought in a seed - bank how can we be sure that the offspring will have the character that w e like? Well the facts are this. If the trait(s) we wish to continue are Homozygous Dominant (BB) in both the parent plants then there is no way we can produce a recessive genotype for that trait in the offspring.

And if both parents contained the recessive trait we can not produce the dominant trait. Let us see this in action too. There we proved that too. So now we are starting to understand that in order to breed a trait properly we must kno w if that that is Homozygous or Heterozygous or Homozygous Recessive before we can understand what it is we are doing and PREDIC T THE RESULTS BEFORE THEY HAPPEN. And this ladies and gentlemen is what breeding is all about - Understanding a traitâs genotype , predicting the outcome of a cross and LOCKING DOWN TRAITS. So how can we lock down a trait you might ask? Well we will cover t his later after we understand a bit more about this subject matter.

He noticed that the offspring all carried the same traits when they breed in with the same popu lation or gene pool. Now since there where no variations in with each strain he guessed that both strains where homozygous fo r these traits. Because the pea plants where from the same species Mendel guessed that either the Solid seed shells where recess ive or the wrinkled seed shells where recessive. So he used the genotype notations (SS for solid, ss for wrinkled). He knew that they could not be Ss, because one lot did not produce any of the other strainâs phenotypes Pea Plant #1 Pea Plant #2 Solid seed shells Wrinkled seed shells Green seeds Yellow seeds White flowers Purple flowers Tall plants Short plants"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":" 366 _________________________________________________________________________________________ when they breed within their own gene pool.

That was Pea plant#1 results. All the offspring will be SS. That was Pea plant#2 results. All the offspring will be ss. The First Hybrid Cross: Mendel made his first hybrid cross between the 2 strains. The results where all solid seeds! Here is the chart below.

But since all the seeds wh ere solid, then he knew that Pea Plant#1 contained the dominant genotype for seed shape and that Pea Plant#2 contained the reces sive genotype for wrinkled seeds. Also he knew that Pea Plant#2 contained the recessive genotype for seed shape. This means that in future TEST CROSSES with other pea strains, he could determine if a seed shape trait is Homozygous or Heterozygous because h e had identified the recessive trait (ss). Remember the rule of test crossed to determine this? Here it is again. 1. The plan t with the dominant trait is always crossed with an organism with the recessive trait. 2. If ANY offspring show the recessive t rait, the unknown genotype is heterozygous 3. If ALL the offspring have the dominant trait, the unknown genotype is homozygous dominant 4.

In this group the resulting offspring will be: SS Ss ss This means that: 25% of the offspring are homozygous for the dominant allele (BB). 50% are heterozygous like their parents (Bb) and 25% are homozygous for the recessive allele (bb).

But when he crossed the offspring because they where heterozygous for that trait he ended up some having the recessive trait, some having the homozygous trait and some continuing the heterozygous trait. In correct breeding terms his first cross between the plants is called the F1 cross or F1 generation. The breeding out of those offspring is called the F2 cross or F2 generation. Now since he has Ss , ss and SS to work with you can probably do the punnet square for each to see how they will work out. It would be a good time t o test your knowledge on this. Compare your results with what you have learned about ratios in this chapter and you will be able to see how it all fits together. It is really very simple once you know a few rules......but like most things there are excepti ons to the rules. Back to frequencies: We know that if two heterozygous parents are crossed that the ratios will be 50/50 wit h regards to the allele (Remember the genotype can be Ss, SS or ss, but the allele is either S or s.

Where we consider a population whose gene pool that the sum of all the alleles must equal 100%, but w e may have different ratios? Such as 80% have S and 20% have s? Well maybe we should look at where these laws collapse and where they fail to work as expected. There are five reasons when the law of equilibrium fails to work. These are: 1. Mutation 2. Gene m igration 3. Genetic drift 4. Non - random mating 5. Natural selection Let us go through each one. Mutation A mutation is the change in genetic material, which can give rise to heritable variations in the offspring. In nature maybe exposure to radiation will d o this. In this case the result will be a mutation of the plants genetic code and thus when it breeds with the same population i t is effectively a âMigrationâ of foreign genetic material. Even though nothing new has been added into the population from an o utside population, the mutation of one single plant will act just like"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":" 372 _________________________________________________________________________________________ another strain that migrated into the gene pool. Gene Migration When we deal with a population of plants we refer to a grou p of plants that breed within themselves without any interference from an outside population. Over time a population will reach equilibrium and this will be maintained as long as no other population migrates to this one. When another population is introduc ed it will cause new genes to enter the pool. This is called Introgression. During the process of introgression many new traits will pop up in the population. Genetic Drift: If the population is small equilibrium may be violated. By chance alone certai n members will be eliminated from the population. We will find that the frequency of an allele will DRIFT towards higher or lowe r values. Non - random mating and Natural selection: This suggests that something external may influence a population to a stag e where mating is not random. If some flowers develop earlier than others then they will gather pollen earlier than the rest. If some of the males"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":" 373 _________________________________________________________________________________________ release pollen earlier than others then the mating is not random. Or maybe all males release their pollen earlier resulting in s ome of the later flowering females ending up as a sinsemilla crop. This means that these late flowering females will not make th eir contribution to the gene pool. Again equilibrium will not be maintained. With regards to natural selection the environment may cause a problem with a section of plants. If this section does not survive then they will not be able to make a contribution to the gene pool. If this is the case and if selections are made so that other plants do not make a contribution th en we know that trait frequencies can be controlled to a certain degree. And the ability to control the frequencies of a trait i s what BREEDING IS ALL ABOUT. HOW TO TRUE BREED A STRAIN Breeding cannabis strains is all about manipulating gene frequenci es. Most strains that are sold by reputable breeders through seed - banks are very uniform in growth. This means the breeder has a ttempted to lock certain genes down so that the genotypes of those traits are homozygous. If we can imagine for a moment that a"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":" 374 _________________________________________________________________________________________ breeder has two strains - Master Kush and Silver haze. The breeder lists a few traits that they like. * Donates the trait that t hey like. This means that they want to create a plant with the following features and call it something like Silver Kush. Now all the genetics that they need are in both of the gene pools for Master Kush and Silver Haze. We could just mix bot h populations and hope for the best or we could try to save time, space and money by calculating the genotype for each trait and using the results to create a Master Kush Silver Haze Dark Green Leaf Pale Green leaf * Hashy smell * Fruit smell White flowers Silver flowers * Short plants * Tall plants Silver Kush Pale Green leaf * Hashy smell * Silver flowers * Short plants *"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":" 375 _________________________________________________________________________________________ TRUE BREEDING STRAIN (An IBL). The first thing the breeder must do is to understand the genotype of every trait that is featured in his/her âidealâ strain. In order to do this the genotype of each parent strain or population for that same trait mus t be understood. Since there are 4 traits that the breeder is trying to isolate then 4 x 2 = 8 Genotypes for these phenotype exp ressions must be made known to the breeder. Let us take the Pale Green Leaf of the Silver Haze for starters. The breeder wil l grow out as many Silver Haze plants as they can find. They will then note down if any of the population have any other leaf co lour trait. If not, then the breeder will note that the trait is homozygous (We will call the trait - M). Now it can either be M M or mm.

If it is heterozygous then we must lock the trait down before we can continue. This is done through selective bre eding. Let is look closely at the parents for a moment. If both parents where MM we would not have seen the variations in the population for this trait. It is a locked down trait. We know that this trait will always breed true in its population wi thout any variations.  If one of the parents were MM and the other Mm we would have ended up with a 50/50 population of b oth variations. But one is clearly homozygous and the other is heterozygous.

Even though we can see the frequencies we still do not know if the Pale green leaf trait is Dominant or Recessive, but we can find this out by performing A Test Cross. Now we are not goi ng to go through the Test Cross chapter again but we can show you how to isolate the genotype that you need, which is either MM or mm because we want to breed that trait true. We must also keep track of the parent plants been used. To keep parent plants alive, clone them! The exact same genetic material will be passed on from clone to clone.  In this this cross do you see MM offspring and the mm offspring? Well by their very nature they can not be the same. By running several Cross Tests we can is olate the plant that is either MM or mm and break away any Mm from the group. Whether it is MM or mm, we can still breed the tra it true by breeding it with other M m M MM Mm m Mm mm"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":" 378 _________________________________________________________________________________________ parents that are only MM or mm respectively. So we may have to do several test crosses to find a male and female that have eithe r MM or mm for that trait.

So if we ran a seed - bank company called âPALE GREEN LEAF ONLY BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS NOT UNIFORM LTDâ then the seeds that we create will ALL breed PALE GREEN LEAVES and the customer will be happy. In reality though they want the exact same plant that won the cannabis cup last year.....or at least something close to it. So we will have to isolate all the traits that helped tha t strain of cannabis to win the cup before people are happy with what they are buying. I think you get the point. How many tests it takes to know the genotype is not certain. You may have to use a wide selection of plants to achieve the goal, but neve r the less it is still achievable and much more so than non - selective breeding in the wild. Each trait must be locked down in a population, so that the population for that trait is homozygous. The next step is to lock down other traits in that same populat ion. Now here is the hard part. When you are working on a trait you must keep the other traits that you are looking for in mi nd."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":" 379 _________________________________________________________________________________________ By breeding alone you may accidentally lock down another trait that you do not want or even remove traits that you want to kee p. If this happens then you will just have to work harder at keeping the traits that you want and exploring genotypes through mu ltiple Cross Tests. Eventually through selection and keeping records you will end up with a plant that is true breeding for all the features that you want. The gene pool is there but the objective is to lock down the traits of the pool. Also by keeping you r own records you will be building up your own little map of cannabis genes. For instance if someone grows Blueberry from a known breeder and asks what the berry taste genotype is, you might be able to tell them a little bit about your experiences and what you found. This may help them cut corners. Maybe one day we will be able to genetically map cannabis and everything will be much easier. Also a breeder never sits back and says âRight! I am going to be on the lookout for all 1000 traits that I want.â That is crazy. What they need to do is concentrate on the main phenotypes that will make their plant unique in some way. Once t hey have locked down 4 or 5 traits they can them move on. Step by step is how True breeding strains are created. If anyone says that they developed a true breeding strain in 1 or 2 years then you can be sure than the genetics they started with where"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":" 380 _________________________________________________________________________________________ somewhat true breeding in the first place. (Known true breeding strains like Skunk#1 and Afghani#1 have taken 20 years to get to the stage they are at now.) Eventually you will have your Silver Kush strain but only with the 4 genotypes that you wan ted to keep. You may still have a variety of non - uniform plants in the group. Some may have purple stems, others may have green stems, some might be very potent, and others might not be so potent. By constantly selecting new traits that you want to keep, y ou can manipulate the strain into a totally true breeding strain for every phenotype. However it is extremely unlikely that such a strain exists on the market that is 100% true breeding for every single phenotype. Such a strain would be called âA perfect I BLâ. If you are able to lock down 90% of the plantâs phenotypes in a population then you can claim that your plant is an IBL. I think in todayâs world that this would be an acceptable % to reach.

A Donor plant is one that contains a true bre eding trait (homozygous Dominant) for that trait. The more lock down traits are homozygous Dominant the better are your chances of developing an IBL. IBL is short for In Breed Line. This does not mean that the line of genetics will be true breeding for e very trait, but in general this terminology (IBL) used by breeders does refer to a strain as being very uniform in growth for a high % of the strains phenotypes. Let us use the example of hamster. In a litter of hamsters we may find that they all have th e same phenotypes. If that population reproduces and no other phenotypes crop up then we can consider the fact that these hamste rs come from an In Breed Line. If the hamsters continue to breed and all show the same traits without variation then we know for certain that the gene pool has been locked down. There are some breeding techniques that you may like to know about. These techniques can seriously breach the law of Hardy - Weinbergâs Equilibrium.

Let us pretend for the moment that both traits are homozygous for leaf colour. The Haze is pale green the Kush is Dark Gr een. Which one is MM or mm we do not know? Until we see the offspring. This F1 cross will result in hybrid seeds. Now si nce M is dominant over m, then we will know which colour is more dominant and from which parent it came from. In the example let us pretend that the overall results are pale green. This means that the pale green allele is dominant over the dark green.

Howev er ALL the offspring are heterozygous. Now here is where we can take a big short cut in manipulating the gene pool for that population. By cloning the parent plant MM, we can use this clone in our cross with the Mm offspring. This is known as a BACKCR OSS. Obviously if our parent is female then we will have to use males from the Mm selection in out backcross. Now out fir st backcross will result in 50% being homozygous for that trait (MM) and 50% of the offspring being heterozygous (Mm) for that trait!

Now let us see what happens when we do our second backcross using the same PARENT that we are keeping alive through cloning. Our second ba ckcross is referred too a SQUARING .

Cubing in reality is less controlled than this. Cubing is a way of increasing the frequency in a population for a certain trait. It MAY not result in true breeding but it will promote a trait in a bunch of plants. Also the actual select ion process is somewhat random. In a population we select a mother plant that we want to keep because of her features. In the same population we gather pollen from 50% of the males that have characteristics similar to the mother plant and 50% that do not. The pollen is mixed is their respective portions.

What happens is that the best male pollen should have been selected by the female as the one that she pre fers. The reason for taking the 2 sets of pollen from 2 sets of males is to create a control experiment to show how this method actually interferes with the frequencies of the gene pool. By right, your selection of poor male pollen will only bring about a poorer quality population that do not resemble the female clone. In reality we only select pollen from the best males that most resemble the female when we use this method. Do you remember one of the laws that breaks equilibrium? Non - random mating and N atural selection. Well that is what we are doing here. The resulting offspring should have a high frequency for the traits tha t we like in the mother plant. The problem is that we do not know which male from the bunch is the one that WON this female ove r, but it is quicker and less time consuming in creating a strain that is somewhat uniform for a specific trait.

The best way to achieve this process is as follows. Find a female that you like and clone this female and her farther. Take pollen from the farther and pollinate the female. The offspring should contain a 50%/50% of the genes for both pa rents. Take pollen from the males of that offspring and mix them together. Pollinate a clone of the mother. This step should in sure that selection is no longer random and you are promoting the frequency of the motherâs traits in the next offspring. Repea t the process two more times and you will have effectively CUBED (meaning backcross x 3) this strain. This can push the mother plants traits as high as 90% in a population but we will probably get some non - uniform plants in the offspring too. Cubing does not really help us to select for traits that we want, like in our Silver Kush experiment. It simply helps us to keep a few trai ts that a mother plant has. Cubing is a common procedure adopted by breeders who find a good healthy mother plant in a selection of seeds that someone has given them. This method can also fail very quickly if your selection of males are the wrong choice .

This refers to hermaphrodite plants that self - pollinate. There is no such thing as a âgene poolâ or population with regards to hermaphrodites since the only pollen that a hermaphrodite will use is the pollen that it generates itself. Both male and female flowers are located on the same plant. Th ere can be variations in the offspring though. It is impossible for a hermaphrodite to create any male only plants.

The guy does not speak English too well but his wit comes through the rough language and he's a riot to talk to. He is a pure lover of cannabis. He feels that everyone should share and share alike and hel p the community in general.

He stressed literally hundreds of plants with an irregular photoperiod. What he does is put the lights on 12/12 for 10 days. Then turns the lights on 24 hours, then 12/12 again for a few days, then back to 24 hours for a day, then 12/12 again for a few weeks. If he does this and no hermaphrodites come up. He has found a 100% XX female that cannot go hermaphrodite naturally. H e says that your chances of finding a 100% XX female is vastly increased when using Indica genetics. He told me that the more Af ghani or Nepalese genetics the plant has, the better the chances of finding a natural XX female. His exact words were \"Where did Mother Nature give weed a home at originally?\" I tried to get him to narrow it down to a ratio, but he never specified just how many plants per are XX females his exact words are \"plenty of XX girls for everybody\" and that is all he will say on the sub ject.

Itâs a very time consuming process but a straightforward one. He says that home growers should confine themselves to ONE strain. Mr. XX used a Skunk#1 x Haze x Hawaiian Indica. He says to separate those plants from your main grow and stress the hel l out of them. Do this over and over with every new crop of seeds you get of that strain until you find the XX female.

"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":" 400 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Chapter 17 HOW TO MAKE HASH Hash is a compressed format of the cannabis drug but it is not just compressed bud. In fact compr essed bud has nothing to do with Hash contrary to public belief. Cannabinoids are the major drugs produced by the cannabis pl ant. We have already looked at Trichomes and we understand that these tiny stalked resin glands contain our THC and other cannab inoids. We also know that female flowers produce the majority of the little trichomes. Now this is all over the flowerâs surface and is correctly referred too as âstalked capitate trichomesâ. Since we are on this topic we will ask you to refer to Figures 1 .12 and 1.14 in chapter 1. The gland heads (the rounded tips) secrete the major cannabinoids within an oil - like substance that y ou can remove by rubbing your fingers over the bud. We normally refer to this substance as resin. The stalks that support the gl and head are secondary to the head in cannabinoid production amounts. The gland and the stalks may also burst. In the case of a strain like afghani#1 that is thick with resin, this sometimes - explosive action of the gland is automatic."},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":" 401 _________________________________________________________________________________________ The reason why the cannabis plant produces resin oils is to gather fallen pollen from the male plant. When we smoke bud, we hope to covert the oil into a vapour, which we can inhale. However the surface of the flowers is not the only area which produc e cannabinoids. It is known that the bulbous glands on the leaves produce cannabinoids and so does the stem, but these are only in minor quantities compared to the stalked capitate trichomes. Hash is made primarily from the collection of the stalked cap itate trichomes. When the collected trichomes are compressed they form a blocky mass, which we refer to as Hashish. HOW TO GATHER THE STALKED CAPITATE TRICHOMES. There are many ways to do this, ranging from bulk hash production to small finger siz ed quantities. Also each method will produce different qualities or grades of hashish. Some methods will gather only the trichom es, while other methods will gather trichomes and some other subsidiary elements like leaf particles and branch shavings. Water extraction seems to"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":" 402 _________________________________________________________________________________________ be the best way of achieving trichome extraction only. Let us look at each home method. We will not discuss other methods used for mass production by some eastern cou ntries, as these are somewhat substandard to the home methods mentioned below. In fact some of these âold eastern practicesâ are less common in their native homelands now because of these updated methods. There is also a preparation process that you mus t go through with your dried plants before you attempt any of the methods outlined below. SKUFF When you harvest your bud yo u will have trimmed the leaves away from the bud. This trim is what we refer to as Skuff. Skuff should be sticky. So whether it is on the stem or branch or leaf or bud, if it feels sticky then you can use it to extract the resin. Now if you really want to be a connoisseur about this then you should examine your skuff for trichomes with a microscope. If any parts of the skuff do not have trichomes then discard them. You must take this trim and store it much the same way as you would canned bud for 3 to 6 we eks. Also the quality of the overall result can not be much better than the genetics that you"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":" 403 _________________________________________________________________________________________ started with in the first place. If you used plants that where not very potent then donât expect to produce very potent hash from them. BASICS OF SCREENING Flat Silk Scr eening: Screening is a process much like cheese grating but on a much finer level. A silk screen is stretched across a square wooden frame and nailed tight to it. The screen typically has a pour size between 180 to 120 microns. The smaller the microns th e higher the quality, but the lesser the amount. The larger micron pours will result in larger sieved amounts but some leaf matt er and branch trim will drop through. This will degrade the quality of hash that you smoke. Actually typical street hash is not nearly as fine or better in quality than the larger pour screen method.  The bud is placed over the screen and can eith er be manually dragged across the screen or rolled across the screen using a roller. Manually it is much easier if you are using smaller quantities of bud but for larger quantities another method should be adopted like the automatic tumbling method. A shee t of glass placed under the screen is the best way of catching the matter that falls through the"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":" 404 _________________________________________________________________________________________ screen. After the process is finished the screen can be patted down to shake any powder that is stuck in the pours. Flat Metal Screening: This is done much like the fl at silk screen method but before the flat silk is used the bud will go through a metal grating process. The metal grate is usual ly made from tough nylon or stainless steel and is of equal proportions in pour size to the silk screen. By first using the meta l grate we can remove more matter from the bud than the single silk screen would do. The bud matter that passes through the meta l screen can then be sieved through the silk screen by shaking the screen back and forth over a glass surface. You can end up wi th 2 grades of sieved bud residue this way. The silk screening should produce mostly trichomes. Multiple Screening Method: This is a refined version of the above two methods. Several screens can be used in this method but the average is four of five. Each screen running from start to finish should have a different micron measurement starting from the largest and running down t o the smallest silk screen. The bud matter is sieved through the first screen and then down onto the second screen. The process is repeated picking up and"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":" 405 _________________________________________________________________________________________ sieving with each new screen until most of the matter has passed through. You should end up with several screens that contain bud matter running down to the finer trichomes on the last screen. This is an excellent way to achieve the best results. You should end up with several screens each with differe nt qualities of cannabis residue. PROPER SCREENING METHODS Now that you have an idea of what screening is about we can l ook at it in better detail. This explanation will apply to all of the above screening methods. We stated that a metal screen is used first followed by a silk screen. Nowadays steel fabrics can be bought in sizes that have much smaller pours than even the finest silk screen. You should typically look for a metal screen that is ranged somewhere between 100 lines per inch to 140 pe r inch. A common screen used by most home hash makers is a screen with 120 lines. A wooden frame is constructed to hold the scre en in place on one side. You can glue the screen on or nail it into place. Take 4 small wooden blocks and place them over a sh eet of glass or a mirror. Place the screen over the blocks. Have a gap of an inch or so between the mirror and the screen. Place small amounts of skuff on the screen and gently role it back and forth across the screen using"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":" 406 _________________________________________________________________________________________ a credit card or similar plastic object. Do this very gently, over and back and over and back and over and back. You may have to push the skuff over and back a hundred time s before you can see the tiny resin glands gather on the mirror below. All this is done with very little pressure. Once you ha ve collected as much resin glands as possible use the card to sweep them off the mirror and onto another surface. Now take the â usedâ skuff and this time apply a bit more pressure to it as you roll it back and forth across the screen. With this little bit of extra force applied you will be able to knock through any resin glands that did not fall through the first time, but you will also push through some veg material such as branch shavings and leaf particles. This second round of pressing will result in a lower quality grade of skuff. You see skuff is skuff. From when you cure your trim to the point where you sieve it through, it is still skuff. Your objective is to try and collect as much resin from the skuff as possible. You will not end up with hash, b ut you will end up with different grades of skuff that can be used to make hash later. You can smoke the different grades of skuff there and then, but you may notice that it is hard to do so. Since this powder is so fine it will typically fall from a jo int easily or pass"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":" 407 _________________________________________________________________________________________ through the pours of a pipe screen. In order to solve this problem we must compress the skuff into hashish. This we will discuss later after we talk about other extraction tech niques. Drum Machines: A drum machine is an automatic screening device. You will probably have to build one yourself bu t this is easy enough to do with the right materials. The size of the unit depends on how much cannabis you wish to sieve at a time. Most drum machines have a 1.5 - 2ft diameter. This is a simple example of what a drum machine looks like. In betwe en the two wooden"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":" 408 _________________________________________________________________________________________ cylinders is the screen. The cannabis trim is placed inside this screen and a small motor attached to the side rotates the drum. As it rotates, very slowly (2 rotations a min ute), the trichomes drop through the sieve onto the surface stand between the legs of the drum. A simple mirror or sheet of glas s is best used to catch the skuff. You can keep the tumbler rotating for up to 1 hour to get the most from your skuff without ap plying any pressure. If you want to apply more pressure to the skuff then place a small wooden cylinder in with the barrel. This will help press the skuff as it passes under the cylinder. Different sized screens can be used to extract better quality skuff. Water Extraction: Resin glands can be removed from the cannabis plant by agitating the trim in cold water, typically ice co ld water or water that has been chilled in a fridge overnight. The trim is placed in a bucket and the cold water is poured in on top. The whole lot is swirled or mixed around using a blender. After mixing you let it sit for a few minutes before scooping ou t the skuff that is floating on the surface. The remaining liquid is strained through a sieve. By sieving this liquid through a coffee sieve you will be able to collect most"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":" 409 _________________________________________________________________________________________ of the trichomes, as they will not pass through with the water. Just let the coffee sieve dry and hey presto!, you got excellent grade skuff to make hash from. The basic idea behind this is that cold water breaks the glands away from the leaf matter. The glands will eventually sink to the bottom of th e bucket because they are heavier than water. The bulk leaf matter should stay afloat which can be easily scooped away. HOW TO PRESS SKUFF INTO HASH Again the quality of the skuff will determine the quality of hash that you will smoke. Remember on the f irst chapter we talked about Zero Zero? Well this is a term used to grade the quality of hashish. The simple ratio is cannabino ids : vegetable material. Good quality hashish has high ratio of cannabinoids to vegetable material. 00 is a term used by Moroccans to express that the hash has the highest level of cannabinoids to vegetable achieved by their extraction process. You can almost imagine that this is the finest skuff available compressed into hashish. To compress hashish is simple."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":" 410 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Take your fine skuff and put into a cellophane bag. Fold it into a block shape. Tape the ends of the cellophane down to create the package. Press it with your hands to make it more even and try to create the best square block you can with it. Use a pin t o make a few holes on both side of the bag. Just scatter a few around. A hole per square inch is a good measurement to go by. Get two or three newspaper pages and dampen it down with a cloth that has just been rinsed. Donât break the paper just dampen it down. Set an Iron to low heat and place the newspaper over the cellophane bag. Hold the iron down over the paper and press it d own with medium pressure for fifteen seconds. Turn the bag over and place the newspaper on top again. Wet it down if need. Press again for the same amount of time. You should only have to do this twice. Let the bag cool for five minutes and remove the ce llophane. Voila! You have a nice block of hash like in picture on the introduction to this book. Easy as pie!

Those big ounce chucks you buy probably only contain 10% of the good stuff, if any at a ll! Many countries use most of these techniques to make hash. You can almost imagine that in order to achieve bulk amounts you will have to use a lot of skuff in conjunction with a lot of employees or several drum machines working around the clock. As a ratio you will find that in order to produce 50grams of good quality hashish you will need about 900grams of dry trim.

Nev er try to do more than what you can. As a whole the following factors are the most important in achieving good results. - Light - Genetics - Preventing a problem instead of solving it - Air circulation - Soil - Pot/Container Size - Fertilizers - 12/12 Light: Without a doubt light is a very important factor in bud production and plant growth. Although results can be achieved using a 25 0W HID or fluorescent tubes, a 400W HID is better. A 600W HID will produce a much better crop than a 400W HID and a 1K HID is th e best single"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":" 423 _________________________________________________________________________________________ light available on the market today. If you are not getting the bud sizes that this book is showing you then upgrade your light system. It still has to be said that not everyon e wants to grow this amount of bud and a 1K HID does cost a good bit of money to run. However with a 1K HID light you will impro ve your results. Also conserving light is important. Use reflectors, white walls and Mylar to keep the spread of light even an d contained in your grow room. Any light leaks mean that usable light is being lost. Youâre paying for it so try and use as much of it as you can. Your plants will love you for this. Genetics: It goes without saying that a plant with genetic traits for low bud production amounts and potency will not create an outstanding plant. If you start with bad genetics you will only end wi th bad results no matter what you do or how good a grower you are. If you want to obtain good genetics then get your seeds fro m a seed - bank that advertises good strains from reputable breeders. Most of the best breeders enter competitions such as"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":" 424 _________________________________________________________________________________________ the âCannabis Cupâ in Amsterdam. You should pay a visit to Amsterdam and sample what the breeders have to offer in the coffee shops. The coffee shop owners will sometimes tell you where you can get seeds from some bud that you liked to smoke. Most of the cannabis plant pictures in this book come from w ell - known strains that breeders have produced. Most of these strains can be bought through seed - banks. Preventing a problem instead of solving it: Prevention is better than cure. Any problem will stunt growth to some degree. Solving the problem befo re it happens entails knowing what problems to expect during your grow. This book has explained some of the problems you will face. Healthy plants are rewarding plants. Take good care of your plantâs health and reap the rewards for doing so. Air circula tion: Very important. Outdoor plants do not have this problem but indoor plants can sometimes stunt or grow weakly if they do not get fresh"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":" 425 _________________________________________________________________________________________ air. Fresh air is important to replace any impurities that build up in your grow room. Also the percentage of different compounds that make up air can change or fluctuate if new air is not introduced into the grow room. This can cause problems with your grow. Also heat can build up in spaces that d o not have good air ventilation. A rise in temperatures can cause a plant to stunt. Keep fresh air moving around your grow room at all times for the best results. Dust is also a problem. In a grow room you need to use ventilation to keep dust from settlin g on your sticky bud. Those tiny pistils are producing the resin that you want. A big blob of dust on a pistil will only stunt i ts growth, not to mention reduce the overall effect that the bud has when you sample it. Air circulation also brings a mild wi nd to your grow. This is important for stem and branch growth. Wind will make the plant react by stressing it a little. That rea ction is thicker stem and branch growth. This is important for bud production, as the plant will be thicker, stronger and health ier overall. I have seen growers use fans in their grow rooms that can triple the width of a stem. On more"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":" 426 _________________________________________________________________________________________ than one occasion I have seen indoor stems that are 2 inches thick and the plant was only 4 foot high! That plant produced the most bud in the same strain population too. The r eason for this was because it was located very near to the main fan and was directly under the light. The growing conditions whe re optimal for that plant. It loved it. Soil: This is the medium that your plant will grow in throughout its life. If the soil does not suite cannabis then cannabis will not grow well in that medium no matter how good a grower you are. You may have t o experiment with soil before you find a good soil that suites cannabis. Do not ever underestimate how important soil is. Make s ure the pH is right and the nutrients that your plant needs are in the soil. Soils should hold a bit or water but should also dr ain well. We donât want muds or fast draining soils. Find a middle soil that does both well. "},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":" 427 _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pot/Container Size: Also make sure that you use plenty of soil in large containers. I can tell you right now that a container that is only 4â x 4â will stunt your overall yield. You will be able to produce close to 0.5 Oz per plant (if the plant has good genetics) in a pot of this size, but a 6â x 6â will allow much more bud growth. A standard pot size for higher quantity results should be around 1 2â x 12â or more. I think a container that is 24â x 24â is good too, but takes up a lot of space. These larger containers are fo r mostly sativa and pure sativa species. Indica/sativa, Mostly Indica and Indica will grow well in 12â x 12â container. Fertil izers: Cannabis plants like food but not too much as we said before. If your provide the food that your plant needs then it wi ll provide you with good results. However some fertilizers can change the taste of your bud. Many people say this is a myth but you will be able to taste the difference between natural outdoor bud and"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":" 428 _________________________________________________________________________________________ indoor bud that has been chemically treated if you smoke enough varieties from various grow techniques. Some people have complained about headaches after smoking indoor can nabis that has been burnt through overfeeding. There are many reasons for this and one big reason is that the grower has not use d a feeding solution that is for food plants but one that is for plant appearance like roses. Some of these non - food plant ferti lizers contain other ingredients than just the standard primary, secondary and micronutrients. These extra ingredients can somet imes be toxic and a warning label is written on the side of the bottle to indicate this. The same goes for pest sprays that are toxic. This is another good reason why you should grow your own bud. However if you have read this book then you know to stick to food fertilizers only and sprays that can be used on food plants. If you get your feeding mixtures right you will boost the o verall performance of your plant. You will keep it healthy too. Hormones can also increase the overall yield and vigour of your plant. In some countries hormones are banned because they"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":" 429 _________________________________________________________________________________________ might interfere with a plantâs genetics.....and yours. It is best to read up more on hormones before you use them, but most people have used hormones, with a good brand name, a nd have achieved larger bud quantities. Hormones can sometimes be expensive. 12/12: If you use 12/12 and keep your flowering room completely light tight, you will improve your overall yields. A 100% light tight room will increase yields by 30% than a r oom that is only 99% light tight. That is how important total darkness is! If you can understand and control the above poin ts then you will achieve the goal. This book will expand on a yearly bases. We will be adding new tips and tricks from grower s around the world to keep up with the times. We hope that this book has helped you in some way and that you will use it for fu ture reference. And remember - Do not break the law .
