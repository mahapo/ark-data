The seeds were traditionally em- ployed as a cold water infusion prepared a vir- gin girl (the Zapotecs also call I. violacea seeds la'aja shnash or \"seed of the virgin\") which is then drunk by the shaman and/or patient. The entire plant and in particular the seed contain Ergine (LA-111), Lyscergic acid amide as well as Lysergic acid-N-1-Hydroxy- ethylamide, Lysergic acid-L-2lpropanolamide (Ergonovine) and other similar alkaloids. Feeding with ammonium is said to enhance alkaloid levels. This is an easy to grow half hardy species, usually flowering in it's first year producing abundant blue blooms. To aid germination soak the seeds for 12-24 hours be- fore then plant 1/4inch deep, bottom heat is benefi- cial. Once established the Ipomoea violacea often self- seeds and even in the England will survive year after year, coming up from the roots again every spring.

Man- drake was also used as an ingredient in Greek wines and possibly also the 'strong' wines mentioned in the Bible. Dioscorides and Pliny describe Mandrake wine as being so strong is was used as a surgical anes- thetic. In ancient Mesopotamia mandrake was consid- ered one of the powerful plants of the gods. A spirit was believed to live inside the root who would kill the hapless when they pulled a root out of the earth. For this reason dogs were sometimes trained to pull the rhizotomes up as shown in the illustration on the left. Frequently the ground around the plant was conse- crated with urine, menstrual blood or sperm in a hope to appease the spirit. Superstition about the harvest and preparation of the plant among the Hebrews ex- plain that a 'tunnel was dug in the ground until it reached the root, which was then dug out by dogs, which of course died afterwards as a result of the poisonous airs surrounding the plant. The plant was then hidden in the ground for a year so that it dried out.

Ayahuasca is one of the most culturally preva- lent entheogens in the world said to \"enter into almost all aspects of the life of the people who use it\" being compared to an umbilical cord that links humans to their mythical past. Prepared as a concoction usually along with at least one admixture, Ayahuasca has been used traditionally in Amazonian Brazil, Colom- bia, Ecuador, Peru, the Orinoco of Venezuela and the Pacific Coast of Colombia/Ecuador. It has also been adopted into the practices of modern suburban shamans throughout Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador & Peru. Often known as vegetalistas they use plant each- ers toderive knowledge and diagnose and cure illness. Missionary Father Tastevin observed \"the Indians believed in a veritable telepathic effect of yagé......they take it in order to find out whether a sick person will become well, to look into the future, to divine, to find out how, for example, one of their own is doing who is on a journey etc. They also believe that Ayahuasca enables them to promptly recognize approaching dangers\". Some paye's maintain that with caapi they can cause eclipses of the moon, tornadoes or control the weather. Chemical analysis has shown the Aya- husaca liana to contain a complex of monoamine oxidase inhibiting ß-carboline alkaloids, principally harmine plus harmaline, tetrahydroharmine, harmol, harmic acid, methylester harmic amide, acetyl nor- harmine, harmine N-oxide, harmalinic acid and keto- tetra-hydronorharmine. The Guahiko Indians of the upper Orinoco basin of Colombia & Venexuela have been observed to chew the dried stems of the ayahua- sca vine and there is scant evidence of the use of Ban- isteriopsis snuffs and enemas. The Witoto Indians have also been seen at times to smoke the dried leaves and bark. The Ayahuasca plant and brew have such a vast and rich native mythology in South Amer- ica that there can be little doubt that it's use stretches back millennia and is surely one of the most impor- tant esoterical botanicals in use anywhere. 100g dried vine - £11.00 500g dried vine - £45.00 Psychotria viridis - Chacruna, Amirucapanga (Rubiaceae) The classical principle admixtures of Aya- huasca and Yagè commonly employed throughout Amazonian Peru, Ecuador and Brazil. Related to the coffee plant in a large genus of over 700 species, Psychotria viridis is a small glabrous tree or shrub reaching 14 foot. It's use has been documented by the Sharanahua and Culina Indian tribes of the south- western Amazon basin, the Kofá Indians of Amazo- nian Colombia and Ecuador, the Kashinahua of east- ern Peru and western Brazil plus in Tarauacá in the Acre of Brazil amongst others. [Individual Chacruna leaf] Said to be added to ayahuasca brews to increase the 'length and vividness' of the visions, analysis has shown the strong presence of a dimethylated tryp- tamine plus trace amounts of N-methyl-tryptamine and 2-methyl-tetrahydro-ß-carboline (MTHC). These compounds hold the other half of the key to the brew's unique synergistic pharmacological interaction between the Ayahuasca liana itself and the principle admixture. These compounds are themselves not orally active but are metabolized by the stomach en- zyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) due to their similar- ity to and/or functions as regular neurotransmitters. The b-carboline complex of chemicals found in the Ayahuasca vine block, or inhibit the action of these stomach enzymes and are therefore referred to as MAO inhibitors or MAOI's. When the normally orally inactive Chacruna leaves are combined with the en- zyme inhibiting Ayahuasca liana a synergistic action between the two plants and your stomach enzymes provoking one of the most mysterious, ancient and pharmacologically sophisticated experiences of na- ture.

Chemical analysis of this species has shown the presence of high quantities of a dimethy- lated tryptamine and it's 5-methoxy variant, N- methyltryptamine, bufotenine plus trace amounts of N-methyltetrahydro-ß-carboline. A more varied and potent alkaloid make-up, which can attribute to the shamans beliefs in this plant species. Often used throughout the upper Amazon as a preferred principle admixture this species also grows in the Amazonian lowlands, southern Colombia & Venezuela, eastern Ecuador, western Brazil and Peru where our material is collected from.

They might catch a glimpse of the clashing rocks that de- stroy souls of the dead journeying to their goal or see the Thunderbird shooting lightning from a huge tuft on his head and producing claps of thunder by run- ning about\". Forming the basis of the Ajuncá cere- mony of the Pankarurú Indians and traditionally be- ing employed by the Karirí, Tuscha, Fulnio, Guage Acora, Pimentiera, Atanayá and other tribes, Jurema has now entered into Afro-American rituals in eastern Brazil. An 1881 report of the Sertões people states that they \"extract from jurema a certain kind of intoxi- cating wine with delightful effects......they strip off the bark and after boiling it for 24 hours, they add honey to counteract the astringency of the inebriating drink which is kept for later use\". Crushed roots of Jurema were once also rubbed into the soles of the feet for an aphrodisiac effect, a practice said to have been espe- cially popular among females. Mimosa hostilis root bark has also reportedly been smoked as a \"marijuana substitute\" by central American guerilla groups under the name Dormilona (sleepy one).

Theophrastus made refer- ences to the betel nut which also appears in early Sanskrit texts under the name 'guvka' or 'pinlang'. In India it has also been integrated within the social and religious system, the gods are said to lack betel in heaven and that humans should offer them betel to keep them in a beneficial mood. Also used as a magi- cal charm and amulet thought to protect against the evil eye and ward off demons.
