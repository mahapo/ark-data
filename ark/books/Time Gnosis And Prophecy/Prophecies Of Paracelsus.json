[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Prophecies of Paracelsus index Sacred Texts Prophecy The Prophecies of Paracelsus Translated by J.K. [1915] Contents Start Reading Like the better known Prophecies of Nostradamus , the Prophecies of Paracelsus are exceedingly cryptic, filled with allegorical symbols and capable of being reinterpreted for any purpose. It comes with 32 surreal woodcuts which seem to reveal additional details about each prophecy. This short book, published in London in 1915 in the shadow of the Great War, was written anonymously (I have yet to figure out who 'J.K.' is). It wraps the 32 prophecies in introductions and interpretations by the mysterious J.K. as well as Eliphas Lévi, the French occultist--who apparently felt that this text should be left to the experts. The original J.K. edition is somewhat rare, and it was reprinted in 1974 by Weiser, although the latter is out of print. Paracelsus, a renowned scholar who is known for his chemical and alchemical writings, may have meant this not only as a set of predictions about the path of the Reformation, but as an allegory of the evolution of the soul. This would not be surprising, as other authors of the period cloaked arcane messages in almost impenetrable layers of symbolism to escape eccelsiastical scrutiny.

The famous French Kabbalist, Alphonse Louis Constant, in La Clef des Grands Mystères , p. 378, wrote: 'The Prophecy of Paracelsus, of which we here give the Preface, is composed of thirty-two chapters with allegorical figures. ' It is the most astounding monument and indisputable proof of the reality and existence of the gift of natural prophecy .' Abbé Constant (born 1809, died 1875), better known by his Hebraistic pseudonym, Eliphas Lévi Fahed, was a distinguished Adept, Magus, and Writer on the Occult. Most of his works have been ably translated by Mr. A. E. Waite. The Preface Eliphas Lévi refers to is not given here, but will be found preceding the Predictions. p. 12 The Prophecies of Paracelsus Eliphas Lévi then continues: 'Following this Preface commence a series of figures. 'The first represents two millstones, the two powers of the state, the people and the aristocracy; but the people's stone is crossed by a serpent holding a bundle of birchrods in its jaws; a hand armed with a sword comes out of a cloud and seems to direct the serpent, which overthrows the millstone and causes it to fall upon the other. 'The second figure represents a dead tree, the fruits of which are fleur-de-lys , and the text announces the exile of the family of whom the fleur-de-lys is the emblem. http://www.sacred-texts.com/pro/pop/pop02.htm (1 of 6)02/07/2003 12:37:38"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Proem 'Farther on the millstone, representing the people, falls upon a crown and breaks it. 'Farther on still a bishop is shown immersed in water and surrounded by spears that prevent him from reaching the bank. In the text it says: \"'Thou hast come out of thy bounds, now thou demandest the earth, but it will not be surrendered to thee.\" (The German text is slightly different.) 'Then can be seen an eagle hovering over the Bosphorus, where the Sultan appears to be drowning.) p. 13 And as this eagle has not two heads and is not black Eliphas Lévi considers that this excludes Russia and Austria. The great French Kabbalist then concludes: ' It would perhaps not be prudent at present to publish the remainder . Curious persons can consult the Latin book printed with the title Prognosticatio eximii doctoris Theophrasti Paracelsi , which should be found in the National Libraries. 'We possess two copies, one in manuscript and the other photographed after a copy printed in the sixteenth century.' Thus far Eliphas Lévi in 1861; this is the year 1915. Now the world is in the throes of a great European war, there is no reason why these pregnant Prophecies should any more be kept secret, and every reason why they should be widely known. Great changes in the world are before us, both in Religion and Politics. Considering the importance at the present critical time of a clearer outlook, this glimpse into the future coming from the past may not be inopportune, and the present publication of the Predictions of Paracelsus may assist and interest, both from a religious and political point of view, all who are concerned in the world's progress. It may p. 14 also serve to aid the reader to a better acquaintance with the great Adept of the Renaissance, when his own quaint words on Past, Present, and Future are reproduced. p. 17 http://www.sacred-texts.com/pro/pop/pop02.htm (2 of 6)02/07/2003 12:37:38"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Proem Introductory I. CONCERNING PARACELSUS THEOPHRASTUS BAUMBAST VON HOHENHEIM, commonly known as Paracelsus, the famous Swiss Physician, Alchemist and Occultist of the sixteenth century, was born on the 10th November, 149 3, at Sihlbrücke, near Einsiedeln, Canton Schwyz, and died on the 24th September, 1541, at Salzburg. Contemporary with Charles V, Luther, Erasmus, and Cornelius Agrippa, Paracelsus stands out as an extraordinary character that has been for a long time misunderstood by the majority of the learned and unlearned alike. Living in the age of the Reformation, siding neither with Catholic nor Protestant, he distinguished himself as a free lance in Medical Science and Occult Philosophy, and would have been known as a Mystic had his religious writings not been so carefully suppressed as to be altogether forgotten. Paracelsus then claims our attention as Alchemist, Physician, Occultist, Mystic, Astrologer and lastly as Prophet, and it is in this last capacity that we shall regard him, as we are about to study and thereby rescue from oblivion those at one time p. 18 famous predictions, of which some have been remarkably accomplished,, while others may be considered to be still in actual course of fulfilment. Concerning the life of this remarkable man we are informed that his first teacher was his father, the learned Wilhelm Baumbast von Hohenheim, a physician, who took pains to instruct him in all the learning of the time, especially in Medicine. At the age of sixteen young Baumbast entered the University of Basle. But he soon abandoned academic studies, preferring the mystic and occult teachings of the famous Adept, Johannes Trithemius, Abbot of Spanheim, a noted Alchemist and Divine, whose ideas he absorbed. However, he soon forsook the Abbot, as he had previously forsaken University culture, to study Metallurgic Chemistry in the mines then owned by the Fuggers in Tyrol. It is not my intention to give a description of the Life of Paracelsus, as such an excellent account appears of him in the eleventh edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica . Fuller biographical details are given in The Life of Paracelsus , by Dr. Edward Berdoe, M.R.C.S., in the Life and Teachings of Paracelsus, by Franz Hartmann, http://www.sacred-texts.com/pro/pop/pop02.htm (3 of 6)02/07/2003 12:37:38"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Proem p. 19 M.D., and in The Life of Paracelsus by Anne M. Stoddart. Those who read German will find interesting details in the little volume, Theophrastus Paracelsus, sein Leben und seine Persönlichkeit , by Franz Strunz. I must, however, differ from the last-named author, who would claim Paracelsus for the Pantheon of German fame and would endeavour to prove that he was a German. He was not. Paracelsus, although he preferred to lecture and write in German, was all his life, heart, soul and backbone, a Swiss. This en passant . Paracelsus, in his book Von der grossen Wundarznei, volunteers concerning himself the following information: 'From childhood upward have I followed these studies and received instruction from those experienced in Adept Philosophy.' He then mentions his principal teachers. 'First, Wilhelm von Hohenheim, my father, who never failed me. 'I studied the writings of ancients and moderns, and had a number of teachers I can hardly name. 'Some of them took great trouble with me, such as the Bishops of Stettgach, of Lavantall, and of Yppen, the Abbot of Spanheim, and further, p. 20 Sigmund Fugger von Schwatz, and many workers in his laboratory.' Fugger may have largely influenced his mind in Alchemy, but in the recently unearthed theological writings of Paracelsus mentioned by Professor Karl Sudhoff in his learned work Versuch einer Kritik der Echtheit der Paracelsischen Schriften , 2. vols., Berlin, 1894-1899, we find a clear indication that he derived his prophetic gift from that source of all Prophecy--Mystic Illumination. Paracelsus--he assumed that name when he began to teach, to indicate his superiority to Celsus--was for all his numerous instructors, to a great extent, like all adepts, self-taught and soul-inspired. A mystic leading a sexless life, he had glimpses of Cosmic Consciousness or Divine Illumination, far transcending the knowledge of his time, and while under such inspiration, that secret spring of all genius and prophecy, he wrote and said more than he knew in his mortal mind. Searching for knowledge and truth, roving through various countries, practising and teaching a system of empirical medicine which we will not here discuss, he got into touch with life in all its phases, and http://www.sacred-texts.com/pro/pop/pop02.htm (4 of 6)02/07/2003 12:37:38"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Proem into a state of mind most favourable to the attainment of that Kabbalistic state of Cosmic p. 21 Consciousness, or Divine Illumination, which rays forth throughout his luminous writings. Famous, yet hated and persecuted by unprogressive contemporaries, misunderstood by the unenlightened of the following centuries, posterity has at last vindicated the fame and character of this hero of Occult Science. Professor Strunz observes of Paracelsus: 'His was a mind of mighty features whose rare maturity converted the stating of scientific problems into warm human terms, and we owe to him the realisation of a cultured human community based upon Christian and humanitarian piety and faith, which things we may well regard as the bases of his teaching concerning both the actual and the spiritual. His restless life never robbed him of that witchery which ever and again flushed the immortal impulses of his soul like golden sunshine; that vision which belongs to the great nature-poet. And yet few men of his time recognised, as he did, the incalculable result to be attained by the empiric-inductive method. . . . Paracelsus felt like an artist and thought like a mathematician, just as he combined the laws of nature with the laws of the microcosm, that is of man with his consciousness, his feelings, and his desires. It was this delicate p. 22 artistic sense which proved to be the daring bridge from the man Paracelsus to the keen-visioned observer of reality, a wondrous viaduct resting upon the traverses of the new humanity, the Renascence. For upon this viaduct moved forward that reconstruction of the universe of which Paracelsus was one of the greatest architects.' * The poet Robert Browning made Paracelsus the subject of one of his finest poems, describing him as an idealist and student of Nature's mysteries. Professor Dowden in his Biography 'Robert Browning' explains the poem 'Paracelsus' as follows: 'The poem is the history of a great spirit, who has sought lofty and unattainable ends, who has fallen upon the way and is bruised and broken, but who rises at the close above his ruined self and wrings out of defeat a pledge of ultimate victory. 'Paracelsus as presented in the poem is a man of pre-eminent genius, passionate intellect, and inordinate intellectual ambition. If it is meant that he should be the type of the modern man -of science Browning has missed his mark, for Paracelsus is in fact as much the poet as the man of science . . . http://www.sacred-texts.com/pro/pop/pop02.htm (5 of 6)02/07/2003 12:37:38"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Proem 'Paracelsus is a great revolutionary spirit in an p. 23 epoch of intellectual revolution; it is as much his task to destroy as to build up; he has broken with the past, and gazes with wild-eyed hopes into the future, expecting the era of intellectual liberty to dawn suddenly with the year One, and seeing himself the protagonist of Revolution. 'Such men as Paracelsus, whether their sphere be in the political, the religious, or the intellectual world, are men of faith; a task has been laid on each of them; a summons, a divine mandate, has been heard. But is the mandate indeed divine? 'Very nobly has Browning represented the overmastering force of that faith, which genius has in itself, and which indeed is needed in the struggle with an incredulous or indifferent world!

ON THE PROPHECIES OF PARACELSUS 'THE world, as the Eddas say, is ruled by three Fates, the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Present rests upon the Past and proceeds from it, the Future from the Present. But it is the Future that holds the ideal to which the world moves, and therefore it is she who conditions both the Present and the Past. The Three are inextricably One.'--H. Fielding Hall, The World Soul . THERE is not the slightest doubt that if the Present is the result of the Past, the Future will be the result of the Present. The three being one, the Future should be as easily read as the Past. But this can only be done when the finite mind of the Seer becomes one with the infinite mind of the Seen, by a manifestation of the Soul, which is the Creator, and source of Truth. The Prophecies of Paracelsus are set forth in thirty-two 'magical' or allegorical Figures with Prognostications to each Figure, a Preface and an Epilogue or Elucidation written by Paracelsus. The entire work evidently relates to predictions p. 28 of mundane events, some to ecclesiastical affairs, others to social political upheavals and changes that have since happened, are actually becoming accomplished or may still come to pass. The Predictions, apparently limited to 24 or 42 years (both numbers are given) from 1530, about which time they appeared, were possibly occultly intended to mean mystic years, meaning either the fulness of time, or 240 or 420 years, which latter term would include the affairs of the present critical time. Whoever studies these predictions cannot fail to see how worldly affairs have followed the course Paracelsus foretold for them either by mystic inspiration or astrological calculation. Concerning the time when certain predictions should come to pass, an eminent seer of the Middle Ages, the Hermit Johannes Liechtenberger, aptly observed: 'Although Almighty God alone has retained the time and hour in his power, and he alone knows future things, and although there is no one in this world who can predict anything with certainty for to-morrow, http://www.sacred-texts.com/pro/pop/pop03.htm (1 of 8)02/07/2003 12:37:40"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Introductory: II: On the Prophecies of Paracelsus or for some days to come, nevertheless the same merciful Deity, of his overflowing Love, has poured various gifts unto his creatures, whereby p. 29 in things that are still distant and in the future, He allows us to understand and know, not wholly, but in divers parables, symbols and comparisons of things already happened with those that are to take place in the future.' These Predictions were at their first publication in great demand and often reprinted. Professor Sudhoff mentions numerous editions and reprints, but they would have fallen altogether into oblivion had not the noted Kabbalist, Eliphas Lévi, drawn attention to them by counselling their suppression. True Initiates are ever on the side of Law and Order, and maintain that the secrets of the Occult should remain occult. But these are times when the old order changes and what has been kept occult must become manifested. The time has thus arrived for making known what has been kept in concealment or lapsed into oblivion for centuries; for as Paracelsus quaintly observes: 'when the time comes then comes also that wherefore the time has come.' In that extremely rare, because suppressed, occult book, A Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery , occurs the remarkable observation: 'Many prophecies there are of times to come, p. 30 and those days are even said to be at hand, when the Fourth Monarchy, which is the Intellectual reign of Truth and Peace, shall predominate, when the Mother of Sciences will come forth, and greater things be discovered than have been hitherto in the past monarchies of the world. But we do not tarry about these matters; the Revelation of all things is always at hand for him who knows how to investigate, and the rest will be always far behind. If truly there be minds prepared, or if the great era approaches more rapidly than is given us yet even in faith to foresee (for notwithstanding so many signs that are appearing, all signal rumours of a coming change, yet they are fewer and far between and more rare yearly which indicate the progression of Truth); but if, we say, a better age is approaching, which at some period of time must come, when abundance of all things by an equitable distribution of all, shall help to break down the competitive barrier of society, and introduce a co-operative alliance among mankind, then this incentive to inquiry may not be inopportunely offered in the self-discovery of truth.' http://www.sacred-texts.com/pro/pop/pop03.htm (2 of 8)02/07/2003 12:37:40"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Introductory: II: On the Prophecies of Paracelsus Curiously enough Paracelsus also connects the establishment of the 'Fourth Monarchy' or Millennium with a rediscovery of Alchemy and a p. 31 universal knowledge of the secret of transmutation of metals. 'Then will the Old Art flourish, and no heed be given to the New. 'Then shall the Pearl so long lost be found by an humble one, and will be set, as a jewel, in gold,' etc. What the world would be if gold had to be demonetised on account of its being as common as lead I must leave to the reader's imagination. The idea of the Millennium may also have served as an occult allegory for the Regeneration of Man, as every reborn Soul lives even now in the Millennium, the Fourth or Fifth Monarchy, or the Rule of Christ. The attainment of the Individual to the Divine mystic state of Illumination would in no wise impede, but rather hasten, the realisation of the Father's Kingdom on earth. Paracelsus calls the Power that rules the world's Fate, Magic. The Creator rules the world by Magic. He is the Divine Magician creating and sustaining the All by His omnipotent Word : Fiat! Be! Man, too, has the Soul-Power of Magic, but it extends no further than the potency of his trained p. 32 will and the reality of his Thought. The Creator's Will being omnipotent, Man's will is only potent in as far as it is in unison with the Creator's. But Man by selfishness circumscribes his power and dissevers himself from the Eternal Unself, the I AM. Were Man to enter the plane of the Divine Unself his power for Good would increase in proportion to his attunement with the Father's Will.

Man, as he now is, has depraved senses but no real Thought. He is but the creature of a day, and perishes like the beasts he devours, having fallen from Providence to Fate. Who can tell the extent of the faculties Man possesses when he is in his rightful state--the Immortal Mind? Who can even faintly foreshadow the vast power latent in his eternal Being? Can the son of the Infinite be finite? Is it not more probable that he too has faculties for infinite development? p. 33 Why should the Future not be known to us as the Past? The Soul knows all things, the Soul being the Eternal Mind. The self-inflicted eclipse of the Soul will not last for ever. Sin is the result of Ignorance and Ignorance the cause of sin. Where true knowledge flourishes sin dies and man becomes a regenerate being. Let us therefore endeavour to understand the everpresence of the Creator in the World and in Nature. Wherever we rightly search Nature's phenomena we can infer from Manifestation to Cause, from Cause to Thought, from Thought to Law, from Law to Love. Nature, when rightly understood, will be seen to act upon the principles of Thought that we can follow, of Love that we can love and that loves us. By Nature we mean the creative Life in Nature. Man should not be subject to Fate, as he now is, but should be a Divine being guarded by Providence, the Divine Mind.

Underlying Phenomena there are Noumena, underlying Nature there is Nature's God--the Creator. Sustaining Matter there is the all-pervading Spirit. The Universe is not void, the Universe is full. Ether holds all things in solution. Wherever we can follow the Creator's footsteps in Nature or in History, we find revelations of Divine Thought. Nature's Law is animated by Divine Thought. He, the Creator, is united to us as the Spirit of Life, the All Soul, the All Life. Our Soul, our Life is a part of His. We are the Creator's offspring, but we can only become children of the Father's Kingdom by an act of mystic self-renunciation. The renunciation of Self--the lower Nature. We may now inquire how these predictions were given by Paracelsus. Although predictions can be made by the aid of Astrology alone and their subsequent accomplishment may be deemed marvellous, yet no one will have a correct foresight unless he sees with the eye of the Soul, whereby comes a true image of p. 35 things seen in the Eternal Mind. Concerning this true Imagination Paracelsus says in his Liber de Imaginibus , Cap. XII: 'Therefore should you also know that the perfect Imagination coming from the Astral, issues from the Soul, wherein all Astra lie occult, and the Soul, Faith and Imagination, are three things to count, for the names are different, but they have equal force and strength, for one comes from the other, and I cannot compare it otherwise than with the Divine Trinity. For through the Soul we come to God, through Faith to Christ and through the Imagination to the Divine Spirit. Therefore also is to these three, even as to the Divine Trinity, nothing impossible.' In the time of Paracelsus it was not safe to know anything beyond the dogmas of Mother Church. We find therefore that most real knowledge became occult. http://www.sacred-texts.com/pro/pop/pop03.htm (5 of 8)02/07/2003 12:37:40"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Introductory: II: On the Prophecies of Paracelsus The Prognostications were given in signs and symbols and to interpret them we will let Paracelsus himself give us a few hints. In the same Book, Cap. V, he explains.: 'When out of Magic a Prophecy is given by pictures and figures, on a city, country, government, principality or kingdom, it is indicated by p. 36 the animals, arms, colours which the same city, country, prince, or king carries, and not described in plain words. 'Therefore every one who would undertake to interpret such Prophecy, should not only be a good Astrologer but also a good Magnus and should know thoroughly what plant, animal or colour each city, country, prince or Lord carries in the coat of arms. 'As an example, the Eagle means in Magic the Emperor, or only his Empire. 'Three Lilies, or only one Lily, the King of France, or the Kingdom of France. 'Three Crowns, one upon the other, or a triple cross, the Pope, or the entire Papacy. 'A crown by itself, a King or a Kingdom. 'A Half-Moon, the Sultan, or his Empire, and so on.' France, the Papacy, the German Empire, England, Russia, Turkey, &c., appear in the Predictions many of which have been remarkably fulfilled. The 'Magic' Paracelsus speaks of is the occult Divine Power that rules the Destiny of the World and the Regeneration of the Individual Soul. It is the World Soul. I should prefer to call it the Creator's Everpresence. p. 37 According to the Kabbala every Nation has a Ruling Angel, Prince or Lord. It is however also esoterically taught that the Archangels are not persons but dignities or grades which the Soul must attain before becoming united with the Creator. http://www.sacred-texts.com/pro/pop/pop03.htm (6 of 8)02/07/2003 12:37:40"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introductory: II: On the Prophecies of Paracelsus Thus might the whole set of Figures and Texts be esoterically interpreted as the phases of the Soul's course towards Perfection, and what exoterically treats of the world's course or destiny may esoterically teach the Regeneration of the Soul. This interpretation could be taken for each and all of the thirty-two figures and chapters. It was a common practice for mediaeval Occultists to write about one subject, teaching all the while another. Such policy was, in those times, necessary. Even as a treatise on the Occult may these Prognostics be found of interest to those who are mystically inclined. The XXXIInd Chapter is profoundly mystical. 'Blessed is he that is born during sleep' refers to the Divine re-birth, the birth of Cosmic Consciousness. Thus, although the chapters and figures openly refer to the world, secretly they may speak of the world in Man. p. 38 Manifestly the Regeneration of the World is treated, occultly the Divine Re-birth in Man may be intended. The Power at work in the one as in the other is that Mystic 'Magic,' the Divine Christ-Spirit. According to Hebrew Tradition, the Incarnations of the Messiah educate mankind for perfection, while Christian Mystics maintain that the world is under the guardianship of Christ. In the Occult Art of Regeneration it is the same Divine Spirit that teaches and guides the Soul in her course towards the 'End'--'Nirvana' the Divine Re-birth. It is a peculiarity of true occult books that they bear looking into beneath the surface meaning, and the more their occult meaning is studied the more it will become manifest. The Smaragdine Tablet of 'Hermes', the Twelve Keys of 'Basil Valentine' and the Amphitheatrum of Khunrath are considered to teach simultaneously Alchemy, 'Magic,' and the Kabbala. These three are said to be not three Arts, but one Art relating to the body, spirit and soul of our being. http://www.sacred-texts.com/pro/pop/pop03.htm (7 of 8)02/07/2003 12:37:40"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Introductory: II: On the Prophecies of Paracelsus J.

ELIPHAS LÉVI'S PREFACE TO THE PROGNOSTICATIONS IN La Clef des Grands Mystères , mentioned in the Prefatory Remarks, Eliphas Lévi gives: The Preface to the Prognostication of Doctor Theophrastus Paracelsus , of which the following is a translation: 'Socrates, discoursing one day upon the too curious research of celestial things, during which one forgets the realities of human life, and of the earth that lies at our feet, exclaims: \"That which is above our comprehension does not exist for us\"; wishing thereby to say that a timorous and superstitious consideration of the heavens is vain, useless and dangerous. 'It may be indeed that a wise man warned by his reason of peril may be deterred from such study. Elsewhere Socrates, in the Dialogues of Plato, everywhere praises moderation and balance in all things. It is thus that the words of this great philosopher should be understood; for there is no reason to suppose that he would calumniate astrology, he being himself, according to the testimony of Plato, an excellent Astrologer. p. 42 'I will not here essay an apology for a science honoured by many learned men, I will only say one word: that there is not another art that can so justly be called divine in its source, in its tradition and in its theory. Read Moses, he will tell you why God has placed in the firmament the sun, the moon, and the stars to be for signs and for seasons, and for days and for years; which inspires Saint Paul to praise those wise men of the world who have found and known in visible things their invisible Creator. It is true that he continues to blame them for not having honoured him more than the creature. God wills, in fact, that we should be attentive to the law of the elements, in order to elevate ourselves from the work to its Author, to know and adore Him; for all appearances and all material forms are but marks and veils that allow the most intimate secrets of nature to be divined beneath them. 'Thus were those magnificent sciences invented, thus were those marvellous arts born, that make us discover in roots, in stones, and even in men powers occult to the vulgar and revealed only to the sagacity of those sages named by Hesiod and by Homer • εροπες , meropes, that is to say, great seekers. p. 43 http://www.sacred-texts.com/pro/pop/pop04.htm (1 of 5)02/07/2003 12:37:40"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Introductory: III. Eliphas Lévi's Preface to the Prognostications 'All the while let us not attribute too much to human intelligence. It is a divine Wisdom descending from the Father of Light, according to the text of St. James. God has given us characters forming letters; He has attached to them all the feelings of the Soul. Through them we can speak; through them as through a divine instrument, He transmits to us and teaches us every day the secrets of all sciences. 'God having thus adapted the wonders of creation to the use of man, has established from the beginning a school of initiation for that. Wisdom which all may not comprehend. There we learn with care the things hidden from the multitude. Thus the fisherman draws his net from the depths of the sea filled with fish that he never saw; the miners bring forth masses of gold and silver from the depths of the earth where the eye cannot penetrate. In this wise in the school of Nature God teaches us and places before our eyes things altogether unknown. Thus there is nothing hidden which shall not become revealed and placed in the light; be it in the firmament of the heavens, be it in the sea, be it in the earth, all must be brought forth to the light of the day by those great seekers of whom I have spoken. p. 44 'Meanwhile these celebrated men by their science cause their immortal names to pass from mouth to mouth; for they have in a manner cleared up Nature, and their memory should never become extinct. The muse never cedes her inheritance of glory to death. It is by genius that we live, all the rest belongs to death. 'In same wise, according to our powers and the gift of Providence, have we desired to glean after those noble harvesters and explained to the world the threatenings of Nature and of the stars, for a period to come, which is to last forty (query 400) years, in order that men may find themselves informed, learning to fear God, and to prepare themselves for the future chastisement of great crimes. It is impossible to express up to what point all flesh has corrupted its way. Anarchy is everywhere. Heaven and Earth are confounded, and were God not to shorten the days of His wrath no flesh could be saved. The disorderly life of men of my time is that which specially determined me carefully to study the stars. 'Now there are signs in the sun, the moon and the stars that announce the speedy coming of the judgment of God. The axe is at the foot of the tree, blood flows upon blood, and as the Prophet says, p. 45 no one among men disturbs himself about God, there is not one who seeks Him. But the Prophets and Evangelists have at present the mission to recall us to charity, concord and unity. Unity is in the Divine Triad, and the Divine Triad is summarised in Unity. 'It is in this wise that in human society, unity, peace, and tranquillity should arise. When unity is broken, plurality of power immediately engenders discord and war. There are as many opinions as there are heads; each one would make his own triumphant; then there is no more harmony possible, but in unity there is rest with abundance of peace. O how well and pleasant it is for brothers to dwell in unity! exclaims the prophet David. Unity is the happiness of all creatures.

Happy is he that sitteth not in the chair of pestilence, and walketh not in the counsel of scorners! The coming of God is at hand. The arm of the avenger p. 46 falls on us; everyone feels the misfortunes coming which he cannot avoid. 'Who will then struggle against God? One kicks not against the pricks with impunity. The God of Hosts is the strong God, the jealous God, who visits the iniquities of the fathers upon the children to the fourth and fifth generation. 'Oppose God, what folly! Foolhardy Titans who would dethrone Jupiter were themselves overthrown by his thunder. It is time to show men their madness, and it is this we propose to do by thirty-two figures intelligible but to a small number of the elect. 'We have seen the consummate iniquity of the people of Gomorha, carrying their blasphemies unto the heavens; but when things are pushed to extremes, the overbent bow breaks, and men are driven by a fatal law to a contrary extremity, whereby motion relaxes and the balance is established. 'Thus by perpetrating crime after crime corruption shall exhaust itself; and who can sadden thereat? Behold the salvation of the multitude is coming and redemption shall overcome the kingdom of evil. 'Who would not be impatient to see the days p. 47 where unity shall be given unto us and we shall live in peace under only one shepherd! 'Then no more troubles, no more injustice, the balm shall descend upon the venerable beard of the High- Priest, the blessing, light, gratitude to Heaven shall spread upon the children of unity. 'Pride having made itself odious even in Heaven, the faithful angels did not weep at the fall of Lucifer, they affirmed the Divine sentence. 'Let us therefore not grieve if God opens now His Hell under the feet of the haughty.

Eliphas Lévi's Preface to the Prognostications 'Our prediction has hardly any other aim than to reveal, as we have said, the threatenings of Heaven against insolent heads. 'God desires to deliver and avenge finally His oppressed children Himself, He wishes to cast down the powerful and to lift up the humble. . . . But it is not yet there that the pains begin. The greatness of evil has not yet revealed itself; it shall reveal itself, and with it a force shall become manifested that will prevent the just from being seduced and drawn into the ruin of the perverse. 'We say that no one shall be named in our p. 48 prophecy. God knows those whom He has resolved to chastise, men do not know Him, but they shall sooner feel that justice has overtaken them than we with our human sagacity can seek and divine. All is concealed and nevertheless revealed to us. 'The Kabbala always veiled, never pronounces oracles without mysteries, and we are assured that it is of her we receive Astrology. God blinds the eyes and hardens the heart of those whom He has delivered to His vengeance, for He no longer wishes to save them. 'In concluding this Preface I pray all those who will read these articles to interpret my words in simplicity and not to seek personalities under my emblems. 'Let them keep their minds free from all thoughts of hate, fear or envy. The event will strike in justice and then those who will shall know. 'I know many others have worked in the same direction, I do not despise either their knowledge nor their efforts, on the contrary I encourage them. 'I see death flying over many monastic institutions, but if men would be wise and were to return to God, He is merciful and good and allows Himself to be moved by the importunity of prayers. 'We do not attribute to the stars a fatal power, p. 49 they impel us by their influence, but if the Master wills it, He alone can alter the direction and change all. Joshua prayed and the sun stood still to allow him to accomplish his victory. Hezekiah prayed and the shadow tarried on the sundial. Elijah prayed and the heavens closed. The continual prayer of the righteous is all powerful. Those who would avert the threatened danger have but to repent, to pray, to live wisely and soberly.

STRASSBURG EDITION OF THE PREFACE TO THE PROGNOSTICATIONS THIS Preface to the Prognostications was given in the Strassburg Edition of the Collected Works of Paracelsus, vol. ii, p. 594. It runs as follows: 'It may be questioned whether we can at all describe the effects of the stars, since we do not see that which passes even upon earth and what lies at our feet, and often stumble and strike against it; far less can we know of the Heavens. But the reply thereto is, that for this purpose we do not use our eyes nor our feet. 'Further can this instruction be given: it is God's will that we should have our experience in all His works, and that we should have knowledge in Nature's secrets, that nothing may be wanting, but that we should know it. 'In this wise were discovered many great arts such as would be tedious to relate. 'As it is God's will that we should know these things, He only can teach them to us, for such knowledge is not of man. Who can tell how letters were invented? Only by divine inspiration, for it p. 54 pleased God that we should have such knowledge, therefore has man learned it. 'Even as God created His miraculous works, that man should know them, He also created a school wherein we learn this knowledge, but this school is not visible or known to everyone. 'The fisherman draws fish that he never saw from many fathoms beneath the water, the miner brings gold from the depths out of the earth, through which his sight cannot pierce. In this wise has God taught it. 'As there is nothing so occult that it shall not become manifest, so the same must be made known. Be it in the celestial firmament, in the sea, in the earth, all things must become manifest; but through man who discovers all things. http://www.sacred-texts.com/pro/pop/pop05.htm (1 of 4)02/07/2003 12:37:41"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Introductory: IV.

For he is not of Adam; but in him acts, and through him becomes manifested in his creatures all that is within him. He teaches it. 'To describe the courses this world will pass through in 24 years is lamentable enough. That man should have made himself so greedy and should have so wholly deluded himself and have failed to realise that his days must needs thereby p. 55 be shortened; and that man should so wholly have forgotten God, his master, and should live not in accordance with His Law. To understand this requires the consideration of the mysteries shown by the signs of the Sun, the Moon and the Stars. It is also a subject for contemplation in what manner the people on earth inflict misery on each other, whereby no one will grant his fellow that the Sun shall shine upon him. 'There is but one number alone wherein we should walk upon earth, that is the One, and we should not count more. In God there are three, but the three are one. 'Thus we men, as God transmutes Himself into one, we likewise on earth should resign ourselves and become one. 'In that number and in no other is there rest and peace (Unity). 'That which is more than this is full of unrest and contention, one against the other. 'For if a reckoner puts a number and counts more than one, how many are the errors in root and result? Hence comes the dire distress and the worm gnawing us. 'How pleasant and good it is when we walk in the One! Heaven has also its physical course in p. 55 that number; the earth and all are therein contained. 'But when that is not, then the Sun, Moon and Stars appear as signs that have to be considered. 'The end however is not yet, although there are signs thereof, but the calamity is only beginning.

The Prophecies or Prognostications do not merely relate to events that happened in the age of the Reformation, and do not refer strictly to 24 or 42 years after they were published, but suggest events that happened long after, some that are even now happening, and others that will happen in the future. Nearly four centuries have elapsed since these predictions were made. I have neither altered nor suppressed any of them, but only translated from the old German to the best of my ability. Whatever interpretation may be given to these predictions their ancient origin cannot be disputed. They were first published about the year 1530, and are extant in print of that period. It is true the first editions give no date, and it is uncertain whether the Latin edition preceded the German, as the latter p. 112 shows more originality of expression. It is by no means improbable that the Latin version referred to by Eliphas Lévi may be only a translation. The German edition Of 1530, which is also found reprinted in the works of Paracelsus collected by Johann Huser and published at Strassburg in the year 1616, was taken as the original for the present translation. The Prophecies occur in vol. ii, pp. 594-608. The Plates have also been reproduced from the old woodcuts of that edition. The original Manuscript of Paracelsus is said to be in the Court Library of the Grand Duke of Baden at Karlsruhe.

I will not venture to interpret any of the predictions, but only chance to suggest the meaning of some of them. Ingenious readers are welcome to interpret each and all of the Prophecies in their own way. It may interest those fond of historical research or who are keenly following the course of political events. Religion also plays a large part in the predictions. As history repeats itself, a prediction thought to have been accomplished by a country, person or event,, may again be verified by another or similar occurrence. Paracelsus apparently saw the future as a series of cinematograph pictures before him, but describes without chronological sequence. As a whole the figures and chapters relate either to the Church or to the State. Thus IV, VII, X, XII, XV, XX, XXII, XXIII, XXV, XXVIII to XXXII apparently p. 114 refer to religious or ecclesiastical affairs, while the rest of the figures and prognostications relate to social and political changes.
