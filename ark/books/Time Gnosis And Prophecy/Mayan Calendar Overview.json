The Mayan sacred books of astronomy and prophecy are painted on pages of processed bark of the Amate tree. Many thousands of these books, called codices, were burned during the early 15th century by Catholic priests. Much knowledge was lost, which is the first step in cultural annihilation. Maya Priests were pushed far into hiding. They could only practice their culture in the most remote areas of Central America. Those who were caught were murdered. This practice continued up to the late 1980’ s The Maya knew this 500+ year period of horror and devastation was coming. It was written in their prophecy over 2000 years earlier... Dr. Carl J. Calleman PhD is a biochemical scientist from Sweden; he has for 30 years worked in labs performing microbiology experiments. Most of his work was investigating how pollution causes disease to proliferate. 8 years ago he trained his attention on the Mayan calendar to see what correlations or sets of facts could be proven not just “studied” as the archeologists have done. What he uncovered with his new found “hobby” is quickly changing the world and the way we live with it. For Dr Calleman, has scientifically proven the Schedule of Creation and Evolution over the last 16.4 Billion years. (From the “Big Bang” forward) Mr. Ian Lungold entered the scene for his discovery of a simple formula to find any day on the Mayan calendar from the Gregorian calendar. There-by providing access to every man, woman and child on Earth to the Mayan calendar. Dr Calleman and Lungold are working together to expose this vital information. He is in Europe and Asia; I have the American continents as my responsibility. What makes this information vital is many fold. First in general we have a road map of time and history. A road map is not a crystal ball, you don’t know just what will happen when you get to a destination. But knowing where you are going and seeing the landmarks along the way, is very reassuring. If you’ve been to a place before you can prepare for the circumstances you will find there. If you were going to Paris for example, you’d need French francs and some French phrases. This Creation pattern has repeated 7 times before and so we have, or at least consciousness has, been through all of this before. The actual pattern of Creation described by the Mayan calendar looks like a pyramid with 9 levels. Immensely long periods of time with shorter and shorter periods stacked on top. Or even more accurately, as a set of nestled vessels, each of them 20 times smaller than the last. Each of these 9 Creation cycles is 20 times shorter than the previous cycle. Each of these cycles is further divided into 13 equal sections of time and each of these sections has a purpose onto http://www.red-ice.net/specialreports/mayancalendar1.html (1 of 4) [12/05/2005 15:02:31]"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"An Overview of the Mayan Calendar Creation. There are 7 sections of day and 6 sections of night to each level. The Sumerian, and Mesopotamians wrote this same pattern in clay tablets as their understanding of Creation. The Ancient Vedic texts, that are the basis of Buddhism, Hinduism, Sufism and Taoism have the same understanding of 9 levels with 13 sections each. Our own Bible, states that there were 7 days to Creation in the book of Genesis. Section one: is a period of “Light” or an opportunity for the growth of consciousness. It is the inception, a planting of seed, a new beginning or impetus to change or flow in a new direction. New perceptions become available. Section two: is a period of “Night” or the opportunity to apply the enlightenment just received from Creation’s flow. This would be the germination of the seed planted in the dark soil or the developments of new points of view. Section three: is another period of “Light” when duality is put on display. In nature, a seed sprouts up out of the ground and displays two leaves. The essential duality is always a new viewpoint that is overriding the ”old” consciousness. As it has come down in human history, this has always been a time of civil turmoil. Section four: is a period of “Dark” when polarized factions come to blows over their differences. Indeed these periods in human history are peaks of violence. (We are in the 2nd Night of the Galactic cycle from Dec 19th 2001 – Dec 14th 2002) Section five: is another period of “Light.” In nature this is the development of a root system and the second set of leaves that will be a permanent part of the plant. It is the establishment of the new consciousness as viable. In human history during this section lies or failed systems are disclosed so that progress is not blocked. (Hold on to your hat as the truths pour forth from mid 2002 through most of 2003) Section six: is another period of “Dark” The seedling set of leaves are dropped from the plant as another set of leaves spring from the top. These are at 90 degrees from the last set. In human history failed systems have been jettisoned, usually by force, during this section. Section seven: another period of “Light” In a plants life, the tap root grows deep to firmly attach the plant while the stock thickens and branches form. It is a period of expansion of the foundations laid. In human history the “New” point of view and way of doing things takes dominance. For instance the empire of Greece was built during this section. Section eight: is a period of “Dark” once again or the application of new procedures. During this time a plant is multiplying its leaves and root system like mad. In human history it has usually been a period of rebuilding and a time of healing. Section nine: here is a period of “Light.” In fact the brightest period of “light in the entire cycle. In a plants life this is when new chemicals are produced that carry the message to form buds. In human history, it was this section when Art was invented, the message of Jesus moved over the earth, Mr. Einstein discovered the theory of relativity and America with the victory of WWI rose to world power. Section ten: another period of “Dark,” in fact, the darkest period of each cycle. In a plant’s life this is the growth of the bud. In your life it was puberty. In human history this has been a time of great physical hardship or major conflicts. The Illonian Ice Age, Neanderthals going extinct, Rome falling and WWII are glaring examples. Section eleven: again we are in a period of “Enlightenment.” This is the time of flowers for the plant. For you it was adolescence. In human history this was the creation of 1st tools, the 1st attempts at agriculture and constructed shelter, the renaissance and most recently, the flower children movement of the sixties. Section twelve: one last period of “Dark” in the cycle happens now. In the plant’s life the flowers wilt and die setting the stage for fruit development or of seedpods that will dry. This is what happened to the Maya civilization right on queue. Throughout human history there have been conflicts and revolts during this period, most recent of these having been the Viet Nam war. Section thirteen: a period of “Light” once again, a time of readiness for something new and different. A time of ascension, going from one level to the next higher level.

In human history it was during these repeating sections that consciousness developed Homo Sapiens, agriculture and domesticated herds, signed treaties to establish the sovereignty of nations and their people and put up the Internet creating a planetary consciousness in 1992. This pattern of Creation, an action plan, can be seen happening everywhere in the universe from sub-atomic particles to galaxies over and over. “As above, So below.” Notice that we go from a “Light” section directly to another new “Light section. The deck is stacked. Creation is on our side and always has been. This pattern does have an acceleration built into it. Each cycle of Creation contains the same amount of advancement and change but each cycle runs 20 times faster. The same amount of change that happened in 1.26 billion years of the Cellular cycle now occurs in 360 days as can be seen on the chart below and in the news on TV.

This is a very important point that will be covered later. This chart does in no way conflict with either the Creationist or the Evolutionist points of view. This schedule marries the two beliefs in fact. No matter how uncomfortable that concept may be at the outset, the facts that Creation has evolved are indisputable because that evolution and schedule continues today. In fact the evolution of all consciousness has accelerated to such a degree that we can watch it unfold step by step as in time-lapse photography in the current headlines. In Dr. Carl J. Calleman’s book, “Solving the Greatest Mystery of Our Time, The Mayan Calendar,” he carefully lays out all of the scientifically accurate facts used to prove this thesis. The article here is not meant to fill everything in, just give an over all view. It is hoped that each person will investigate these facts for themselves and not take any of this on “Faith”. Belief in this thesis is actually counter-productive for two basic reasons; those without adequate knowledge can not effectively pass the information to others and a formula that I have developed which states; “Peace of Mind” comes when a person is “Centered.” Centered-ness comes from Certainty. “Certainty comes from the recognition of patterns. So the stability of your “Peace of Mind” is directly related to your degree of certainty. Blind faith, in my opinion, is not certainty but an obstruction of any facts that might undercut the faith. Thus creating a limit to one’s true Peace of Mind. This in turn is the generator of all types of defensive measures including wars, to protect one’s personal faith in how things are or ought to be. We’ve gone down that road far enough don’t you think? I would like to show the evolution of Religious thought as a further demonstration of this http://www.red-ice.net/specialreports/mayancalendar1.html (3 of 4) [12/05/2005 15:02:31]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"An Overview of the Mayan Calendar schedule. This is something that all religious scholars can agree on no matter what denomination or personal agenda. As previously stated the “Light” sections or “Days” of the Creation cycles, are periods of enlightenment when new perceptions are gained by consciousness. So it is with the evolution of our concept of G-d and our relationship to him. “Day” by “Day” we have increased our understanding and altered our approach toward G-d. The first “Day” of the National cycle was from 3115 BC to 2721 BC. It was at this time that the Sumerian’s worshiped An or Anu. Anu was seen as an omnipotent Creator God who had to share his space with a host of household, workplace, weather and nature gods of all kinds. The second “Day” of the National cycle was from 2326 BC to 1938 BC. During this section Abraham moved to Cana in 2300 BC. The third “Day” of the National cycle was from 1538 BC to 1144 BC. This was the time of Moses and the beginning of Monotheism. (The Truth coming into sharper focus.) The fourth “Day” of the National cycle was from 749 BC to 355 BC. Isaiah was from the year 748 BC, Buddha, 552 BC, Confucius, 551 BC, Zoroaster, 550 BC, Pythagoras, 550 BC, Deutero- Isaiah 550 BC. The fifth “Day” of the National cycle was from 40 AD to 434 AD. During this period Paul took the message of Jesus to the world and Christianity was born. Buddhism started in China 60 AD and the Talmudic and Judaism religions began at this time. Not to mention Quetzalcoatl, the Maya Creator god who appeared to them in Teotihuacan, as a Christ like personage with a very similar message, in 40AD The Fifth “Night” 434 AD to 829 AD was when Islam was inspired in 632AD The Sixth “Day” of the National cycle was from 829 AD to 1223 AD. At this time there was a general expansion of Christianity to Northern and Eastern Europe. The Crusades and development of the Papacy happened here as well as the second Quetzalcoatl in the Maya/Toltec city of Chichen Itza walked the earth. The sixth “Night” the second wave of Islam 1223 AD to 1617 AD The seventh “Day” was from 1617 AD to 2011 AD. During this period, Christianity expanded once again, starting with the Pilgrims in 1620 AD. We could go through the discovery of scientific principles or communication methods or development of political ideals or the creation of America and we will see that the developments in each field conform to the same schedule. In fact everything we know of what has happened when follows this schedule. There is no mistake; this is no 16.4 billion yearlong coincidence. To be continued....
