All evident creation is a quantum agency. I ndividuated consciousness and soul is a quantum agency. Nature and God are a mutualistic quantum agency. 2. The singularity of the universe exists in hypers pace-time as a periodic toroidal standing wave. The global continuum is a worldline of in terconnected quantum causal manifestation. 3. Present time, locally speaking, is the combin ed moment to moment relativistic coupling of space-time as it dynamically accretes in motion in the continuum. Present time is the conjugated, integrated, evident actualization vectors that are cooperative1y operating from many quantum co-creative contributing agencies. 4. The physical universe exists in a self-cont ained continuum of propagation of mass, form, force, and motion in space and time. The macr o-quantum physical universe, our presently whole and observable physical universe of space- time, has a 4 dimensional existence, but it also simultaneously exists as a super-singularity in hyperspace. The universe is a living accretion of temporal embedded, coupled, energe tic eddy, or torus, floating in hyperspace. 5. The potentiating, accreting, continuing moment of present time, exists as a mutual co- creating, quantum agency of actualization potential between participants. Quantum agencies allow and co-create with and in concert with other individualized agencies. 6. All time and space as a continuum relative to past and future is mediated by the continuous present time standing wave pot entiation moment, the maximum determination point of space- time rate-of-change propagation as relativistic and hyper-relativistic stresses between mass, form, force, motion, and field. Hyperspatial information transfer couples present time to probable past and future worldlines as chrono-morphology - scalar reflections from real space into hyperspace accretion space and back. 7. Multiple soul agencies cohabitate the same universal assemblage. Together souls intersect and aggregate in the same universe, produc ing group quantum influential effects. 8. Worldlines are usually totally self sufficient and bear no need, in the 'many worlds' Copenhagen interpretation, to somehow split or permit multiple global outcomes. There is a principle of least action at work. 9. The only worldlines that exist are accommodated as a least effort probabilistic co-creat i ve forces phenomenon. This aside, global worldlines can still bifurcate into two or more lines, if rare mitosis permitting conditions occur. \u0001\u0001 • \u0001"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 10.The only yardstick for dual timeline creation from a single timeline in progress, is addressing soul growth issues on a personal and mass basis as mutually exclusive. How can soul growth, as evolutionary immanent issues be addressed in a mutually exclusive way on the global scale? They cannot, unless there is an unde rstood, natural accommodating force in the universe that can assist such large scale 'reality' bifurcations. 11.To support the idea of separating into altern ate reality worldlines, we must understand the existence of how our universe functions from a higher dimensional point of view. And we must consider whether to admit, in the firs t place, that worldly quantum accretive forces would both demand and accommodate timeline spl itting. For many the favored reality is one of convergence over divergence, but for many souls on strongly disconnected paths, divergence may yet be demanded. But how? 12.The nature of how we do it, it turns out, DOE S permit global timeline mitosis should it come to that, but it is not likely. The point is, why should it come to that? It probably won't. But regardless of what we think otherwise, the truth can get very much stranger than fiction. The global mass quantum of the population of Earth, no rmally in cohesive continuity as a diverse community of souls, can, upon occurrence of a significant discontinuity event or volitional event, become separated into more than one line from the conscious focus of experience of some groups of souls. Singular souls my have lives in parallel timelines that each in themselves offer growth, each with different degrees of soul energy connected to different life paths in respective worldlines, coexisting at the same time, in different space. 13.Dimensional splitting, or mitosis, on a large scale is not impossible. And it happens not because any participating quantum agency wants it too, it happens because of the way souls morphically resonate together in joined concert. Souls accrete into their appropriate growth environment or universe. Soul groups operating with unacceptably divergent growth values, or rates or levels, can naturally counter-resona te, or bi-phase into two or more mutually exclusive global quantum associ ated groupings. Different energetic isolation of associated quantum co-creation groupings is accommodated only under high stress, divergent quantum co-creative conditions. 14. Sufficient existence of the same universal energy can be isolated into coexisting but not interacting phase basins. Phase groups can be quantum-disconnected from any other mutually exclusive phase groups that exis t. Space-time torsional phase grouping and association seems to have more to do with emotional growth styles than anything. 15. Until the early 1980's when linear time cracked there were just two probable worldlines, one bifurcation. The three primary emotive-morphi c phase groupings, or signaturesm, or styles developing on current day Earth might divide into: 1. love/life centered, 2. pos-neg life centered, 3. hate/death centered Love, life and death represent 1. win-win. 2. win-lose, and 3.lose-lose 1. we make it 2. we suffer 3. we all die as primary divergent global endgame options."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 This is currently accreting into three global concentrates: souls, who as their general center of gravity, hold: 1. all life sacred, or 2. only some life sacred, 3. no life sacred, or alternatively means 1. Earth makes it 2. Humanity whacks itself 3. Earth is whacked as a whole, we almost ruin the Earth, cosmic forces, most die. Which means one of three paradigms: 1. Mutual-causal paradigm 2. Bi-polar paradigm 3. Random paradigm 16. Make the leap and trust that soul growth valu es can and do drive evolution, on a macroscopic scale. And that yes, even physical crea tion is quantum co-creative and mutual, a consequence of causational forces of originator quantum soul will, present soul will, and destined soul will. In this sequence at some level all souls are one, and then diversified into infinite variety, to ultimately join again anew,w ould be we 'each' were 'none of it', 'part of it', and 'all of it', in that order, and for the enlightened, paradoxically all at once. 17. When there is a paradigm conflict of such measure that natural dimensional resonance factors collect into distinctly different mass soul 'basins' then with some willing help from creational dynamics, the world sustains splitting into more than one future path simultaneously for different participating soul groups. Then a confluence of factors together initiates a global scale of Earth dimensionality mitosis. While maybe this is not such a big effort as one would suppose, it is does not support the idea of whimsical or infinite global geo-physical worldline creation. 18. Dimensional mitosis itself is not physical deat h nor disappearance of anyone, it may even be unnoticed. Nor is worldline mitosis creating a new macro-quantum universal singularity, a wholly separate universe keyed to a di fferent space-time continuum metaverse, or hyperverse. Instead this is a mitosis of resonantly grouped morphic information signatures that couple into the same larger singular physical space-time conti nuum universal quantum energy system, but do it at different phase of actualization moment, at the same present time but in a different space. 19. The secret of human destiny is that to exist in the future world that flourishes, is to have been intimately, participatively connected to the world that solved it's critical problems. There is no presumed divine deliverance. Ma ny souls may effectively insist on quantum generating a worldline where environmental or human catastrophe overtakes humanity and the globe on grand scale. The purpose of this or any soul growth exercise may be likened to 'you get out what you put in'. 20. You get out what you put in, may divide into three quantum future paradigms: (a) Souls who end up in the future worldline that soon meets with geo-cosmic catastrophe that few endure, fall in the group of individuals who are the most resigned and cynical about human nature, and often by attitude, and beliefs, contribute to the intractability of critical"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 world problems. People who harbor anger, fear or negative judgments about a 'world gone wrong' often can only see solutions through destruction, through some kind of cleansing, often massive environmental disaster, full of death and suffering. Souls only bring on eventual doomsday by their inability to sense any other way to regenerate themselves, or any other way to respond to the calls of dissonance they are hearing. (b) Souls who insist on being in the future worldline that meets with eventual human caused armageddon: Human apathy and greed, se lf absorption and numbness, and lack of community degenerates into a default future worldline momentum of grave danger through inhumanity to humanity on a global scale in economic breakdown, civil breakdown, or terrorist world war III. (c) Souls who insist on creating a future timeline that resolves, dismantles and defuses the human and or geo-cosmic forces of dissonance end up creating a world that, with some birth pains, not only survives, but flourishes and thrives. These types of individuals intelligently and embracingly transmute dissona nt energies into grand consonance by their intention, attention, humanity and effective wherewithal to take action to appreciate the best in all people. 21. To a greater or lesser degree, all souls inhabit all major worldlines to the extent they find soul growth values in all such worldlines. Therefore, souls exist in multiple dimensions of varying worldlines simultaneously, though the souls energy quantum may vary greatly. Whatever worldline you find yourself in, of the three major developing lines, is the one you have chosen to focus your consciousness within for purposes of growth. Your reality reflects your choices in that regard. Whether it is relatively beautiful or horrible, the higher soul growth values determine that placement. Thus, there can be no judgment of value except in terms of HOW and WHY you function within whatever reality line you are in. It may be most valuable for you to experience and respond to pa in or experience and respond to love. Both energies effect evolutionary advancement, albeit with different locally experienced desirability. Second Ark: Multiple Universal Singularities Support A1ternate Timelines 1. An individual universal singularity can support th e existence of multiple universal variants of global causality through the existence of di fferent embedded phase-locked groups of circulating frequencies and energies associated with the one singularity. 2. Global reality accretes in a hyperspatial dime nsional basin of mutually resonant standing wave phaselocked frequencies. 3. The temporal energetic accretion wavespace of this toroidal system is cyclical, fractal, linear, and non-linear. 4. In-phase group quantum torsion effects in relativistic space-time impress a resonant superluminal propagation field. 5.

Real space is embedded in a non-local, hyper-d imensionally- enfolding resonant system, a basin in hyperspace-time. 7. All phenomena is bound into immediate, non-relati vistic scalar tension or torsion in the relativistic wavefront of present time. 8. All time and all space meets in equilocal and equi-temporality in hyperquantum action terms beyond physical quantum action terms. 9. Scalar packing, or space-time enfoldment intensity across space and time torques, or torsions, real space, in the temporal axes more than spatial axes. 10. Spacetime continuously exists in a torsion fi eld of hyper-spacetime, which torsion varies according to expressive intensities of actualizing hypers patial conjugation. 11. Hyperspatial conjugation or hypertemporal c onjugation of patterns, produces morphic signature resonance that instantaneously propa gates in a synergetic field building manner to intensify morphic pattern propensities in local space-time. 12. Physical reality is not bent as a curv ature of spacetime, but time-space dynamics are embedded into widely varying temporal d imensional dilation and contraction. Stress between discontinuities of spacetime are accomm odated by compressibility in the variations of temporal dimensional density. 13. Dilation and contraction can be caused by both thermodynamic and informational field content complexity. Holo-semantic informin g content torsions across space-time, between all dimensional phase and pattern identity expressions, as radionic morphic wave-pair resonance, bi-directional equi-loca lity between all points of spacetime. 14. Non-local super-finity can function as an information transfer carrier of the hyper-beingness of the present. 15. A space-time singularity is an observer associ ated, group quantum effects functional event operating in tandem with universal cocreative energetic agencies. 16. High magnitude counter-resonance effects at th e global systemic leve l can stress spacetime to bifurcate into multiple phase groups of the original, sufficient to initiate spatio-temporal phase torsion field bifurcation, or in some cases, trifurcation. 17. Global phase bifurcation can be accommodative creation through reflecting equal energy into multiple phases around the same universal singul arity. The result is experientially oblique dimensional singularity mitosis. 18. Space-time field singularity accretion mitosis ma y be initiated by global earthly space-time high magnitude discontinuity events. 19. During anomalous dimensional bifurcation events , strong attractor centers already exist for the individual human agency, by self selected association in and into the future line that resonates.

We live in a common, single, space-time unive rse, a real world physical universe bound together with its laws of space-time, of ma tter, thermodynamics, Newtonian causality, and quantum causation, mass field quantum cohesion. Th ere is a self consistent continuity of the laws of mass and energy in our universe, of form and force, inertia and speed of light, fields and waves, and nature of the space-time continuum. 21. Universal cohesion is quantum effective as a re sonant spatio-temporal torsional field, with self entrained energetic coherence in all fractal scales of phase-embedded periodic system behavior. 22. From the point of view of hyperspace, we liv e in the accretion eddy of a space-time periodic orbit eddy, which at the largest scale is a toro idally configured energy circulation space. 23. Consciousness inhabits the full period and infi nite subperiods of the primary period of the hyper-toroidal loop-rate of space-time. 24. The spacetime universe system functions as a resonant toroidal soliton, a ball-lightning like energy waveform energy loop, a balanced sta nding wave of quantum possibility to actuality, cooperatively potentiated by individualized, mutual and universal consciousnesses. 25. The soliton orbit of the whole universe integrat es space-time singularity at different fractal levels of scale of energy and temporal torsional phase stress embedding. Embedded torsional information fields resonantly fit into the primary orbital period of the universal system in common temporal phase lock. 26. Sources of morphic information content resona ting together generate scalar compressive, concentrating torsion effects in local spacetime curvature. These torsion effects relative to local space-time are non-locally connective as a superluminal curvature compression or modulation of space-time. 27. Morphic information content resonates across s uperluminal torsion waves as a spontaneous, hyperspatial associative wavepa ir pulse loop accretion phenomen a. Spontaneous wavepair or hyperloop formation occurs between iden tity-morphic information codes (i.e. DNA or emotion). 29. Morphic identity accreted wavepair hyperloop resonance can, in concert, synergetically generate pattern entrainment e ffects beyond the connecting sources. These effects can appear as locally amplified remote attractor effects in space-time. Third Ark: Universe and Multiverse Complexity Follows Soul Growth Complexity 1. There is spatio-temporal field stress that resonantly holds all matter and energy interaction in a locked phase conjugated field. 2 There is cohesion in the interactive temporal phase stresses at all scales in the total dimensional scalar and serial linear continuum. Temporal cohesion is relativistic complexity propagation stress, a function of propagating dynamic complexity or local packing or"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 embedding of complexity in terms of morphi c stress, electromagnetic field stress, and gravitational binding stress terms. 3. Complexity is synergetically emergent and supported within the universal space-time singularity. 4. All life and matter exist in a singular spacetime continuum, the normal state of affairs. 5. One space-time continuum can occasionally support mutually exclusive causal branching, as two or more causationally associative temporal aggregating quantum energetic accretions. 6. Bifurcation splits one space-time phaselock ed accretion into mutually independent phaselocked groups of associate, synchronized energy and consciousness. 7. Each separate space-time phase group accretion generates a different summation waveform that has a signature resonance that identifies the universe, like a fingerprint. 8. Entrainment into a universe's quantum resona nt signature depends largely on already having enough common resonance enough to access it. 9. Mass-quantum multiphase accretions can exist, from the point of view of hyperspace of one singularity, as branched parallel or divergent, separately phaselocked streams of energy and consciousness. 10.Different localities in real space are hyperspatially mapped as different positions on the hemispheric rim of toroidal creation, a ring of standing wave quantum present-time presence or quantum presentation, in circulating toroidal hyperspace, 11.It may be said each soul is a miniature individual quantum universe creative agency, and that together, in diverse but mutual action, souls join to be with each other in a mutual universe. 12.Soul quantum agency co-creative power can pul se oscillations into the torsion of spacetime assemblage. Soul agencies readily join into a mutual universe for mutual growth. Quantum agencies accrete a co-l ateral universal spacetime conti nuum of mutual assemblage. an integrated cohesive self-consistent worldline. 13.Present time is a global actualization wave peak signature. Given sheer concentration of immediate quantum actualization wavecrest focus by co-creating soul agencies, there is a hyperfield space-time torsion effect that propagates through the system. 14.Present time actualized energetic relativistic energies generate hyper-spacetime torsion precursor waves. 15.The torsional oscillations of space-time propa gate morphic information as a probabilistic hyper-accretion throughout the hyperverse of space-time continuum. 16.Hyperspatial torsion wave s propagate from a given pr esent time space-time locality 17. These hyperfield torsional oscillations, in turn, generate natural tautological harmonic conjugation and assembla ge potentials throughout time instantaneously."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 18. Trans-time torsion wave signatures resonantly conjugate into potential future time eventuations and even past time pre-eventuati ons, as both near probable and possible lines of quantum reality worldline assembling. 19. From the present time quantum convergence wa ve, conjugations across time generates pre- physicality existence as a quiescent post-cursor or precursor wave signature, 20. From the present time quantum convergence wa ve, conjugations across relativistic local space generates aggregative cocreational propensity between agencies, resonating as a higher amplitude torsional modulation with a specific morphic signature. 21. Quantum actualizing influential agencies, send oscillations of associative quantum creative signature into the space-time hyperfield. Torsi onal vibration of space-time present quantum continuity assembles morphic information os cillations that propaga te into hyperspace and hypertime. 22. Torsion varies in local space-time based or qua ntum energetic: complexity. Torsion varies based on the diversity of collateral quantum creative mutuality of aggregate participants. 23. Torsion varies to accommodate different relativistic energetic and self-organizing complexity embedding requirements. 24. Torsion can be affected by conscious awarene ss and sentience, but most of all by Love. 25. Linear time is embedded in the local torsion of hyperspace that permits present time real space to exist as a wavefront traveling peak of quantum actualization accretion. 26. Higher torsion can produce regional temporal basi ns which concentrate or embed or shelter accelerated relativistic energies. 27. Higher torsion local space can generate a sp acetime packing function, embedding periodic coupling, fractal curling of local spatio-temporal locality in a volumetric zonal fashion. 28. Spacetime stretches to accommodate relativistic acceleration, often a life energy and soul energy concentration zone. 29. Real-time energetic and informational co mplexity produces tors ional spacetime phase propagation reflections into the torsion of space-time fabric. 30. Torsion is a phase oscillation factor that embeds morphic information content. 31. Non-material morphic information si gnatures conjugate across space and time. 32. Torsional waves, at any moment, in sum, in associated aggregate, establish future macro- quantum propagation, and then in turn estab lish back-propagated attractors, as a hypertime feedback loop. 33. The present time moment is the active focus of the system, and reflects the actualized quantum consequence confluence of participating agencies."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"    10 34. The mass-quantum causality momentum point of physicality is a peak resonance of a moving, yet standing wave pattern of effective 'present-time' in the system. 35. Present time exists hyper-geographically in th e hemispheric instantiations of the universal space-time toroid. 36. Present time is a standing wave convergence amongs t the matrix of all pa rticipating waves in the closed loop hyper-spacetime system of our universe as it exists . 37. Present time is a dynamic, maximum signal ga in zone on the hyper-spacetime toroidal hemisphere, as accreted actuality. 38. The universal hyper-torus has a system energy cycle of (a) zero-point of all possibility singularity through (b) probability convergence, into (c) some-point of given actuality. 39. The passage of time is reflected as a sequen ce of moments of space-time actuality, with each moment representing one loop through the mass-zero-point singularity into mass-actuality at a frequency senior to embedding all conti nuous motional instantiation in quantum terms. 40. The loop rate of the present time accretion sy stem in hyper-spacetime is the frequency of time as a conjunctive relativis tic mass-quantum wave-partic le accretion macro-event. 41. If the wavepeak accretion period were to be vibrating in a different phase of the period of the hyperspatial toroid, then it would not be c onvergent in the same present time accretion association, in mass quantum terms. 42. Multiple global quantum mass accretions can co-e xist but not interact or energetically converge if they accrete in a different phase of the period of the toroidal hyperspace circulation of space-time. 43. Quantum volitional agencies in the same universe associate together by virtue of operating in-phase in quantum energetic terms with each other. 44. Different loop rates and phases of loop hyper-en ergetic pulse cycle, can generate different fundamental spatio-temporal convergent ener gy carrier phase positions in hyperspacetime. 45. Different phase groups exist in hyper-spatia lly adjacent and hyper-temporally adjacent quantum accretions. 46 Different proximal but independent universe world lines, in relative terms, can be distinguished and mutually excluded fro interaction by thei r fundamental difference in loop rate alone establishing alternate phase positions on the accretion hemisphere as coexisting but not interacting standing wave phasegroups. The fundam ental loop rate entrains in-phase all its participating asso ciate frequencies. 47. The circulating patterns of the hyperspace- time toroid often have multiple depths, or embedded layers, as a function of loop rate, fo rming an onion of separately circulating energies."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"    11 48. Multiple universal space-time continuum gl obal worldlines can be accommodated as differently phased accretions in the singularity of the metaverse encompassing our immediate universe. 49. Each toroidal phase forms a self-sustaining onion layer comprising unique, separate incidence of present time, convergent in its own hyperperiodic quantum actualization moment. 50. Each 5D hyper-layer is a self contained 4D un iverse which coexists in proximity to other adjacent universes relative to toroidal quantum loop rate, phase, and soul growth morphic signature. 51. Different standing wave onion layers are coincident laminar hyper-surface basins of differently phased space-time accretions rela tive to the same fundamental zero-point singularity. 52. The different mutually excluding layers are re sonant standing wave z ones of self-relative phaselocked energies and frequencies. 53. Different phaselocked groups of energies accr ete mutually exclusive space-time aggregates which are dimensionally proximal but not interacting. 54. In this dynamic structure different variant universes or space-time lines of accreted global causality and consequence can be generated and co-exist as parallel worldlines. 55. The global quantum accretion sink is an a ssociated phase group of quantum accreting agencies, and forms the basin effect of existing in one phaselocked universe. 56. Within the sink of a given phase-locked universe, it is almost impossible to jump over to another universe of another phase , unless coupled to its phase and coupled to the phase of another universe, which is enabled wholly on the basis of the soul growth morphic identity resonance characteristics. 57. Differently phased universes can entrain, repel, or detrain, one another. 58. Other proximal universes operate in a diffe rent space-time phases in hyperspace linked to the same meta-verse super-singularity. 59. Each path is a mutually exclusive local universal spatio-temporal accretion operating in a variant phase center and period in the unified field of the total universal space-time accretion toroid. Fourth Ark: Mass Quantum Volitional Res onance of Souls and Styles of Growth 1. As souls, we each create and co-create our jo ined quantum reality, even though there are accretions of reality that exist before and without us. 2. The universe attempts to synchronize to us and we synchronize to the universe, as a co- creative balanced loop, in space-time, in mutual torsional phase, together."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"    12 3. Creation exists without us, yet we each voliti onally influence the quantum potentiation of the universe we occupy. As groups we do this toge ther in the larger quantum spacetime actuality in which we live, together, joined into a same-phase universe. 4. Many souls joining together into a mutual universe is only possible if each soul is a miniature space-time singularity. We cocreate with other singularities, and associate with pre- existing mutual singularity accretion - our universe. 5. We therefore exist in a mutual quantum space- time universe, a mutually resonant aggregate singularity, called physical reality, which is at once both an independent macro-singularity (God created), and a mutually created micro-si ngularity as the resonant sum of a group of micro-singularities (called souls) operating together. 6. Earthly macro-quantum human reality in mass-volitionally diverge into more than one timestream. The meta-universe appears to per mit local and global dimensional causal split-off events. 7. The meta-universe of inten tion about 'what is soul growth' does indeed support bifurcating regional universes to accommodate divergent soul group growth issues. Planetary level dimensional space-time mitosis events presumes mutually exclusive temporal soul growth patterns. Split-offs, regionally divergent realitie s, and mutually joined continuity are all features of a soul growth accommodating hyper-universe. 8. When planetary mass quantum level singularity re ality is necessarily split into more than one mutual space-time continuum quantum universes, these things could only ever possibly occur by being essential soul growth fitting demanded, and gifted. This demand operates in a shared universe inhabited by soul groups requiring different but similar paths of learning. 9. Usually tremendous variation can exist in the local universe, but when coexisting large groups of volitional agencies must diverge into different dimensional local universe space-time phases, it is always and only greater univers al creation operating in cooperation with the mutually exclusive soul growth factions. 10. The global singularity phase bifurcation gene rates different timeline causality sequences. 11. The bifurcation process operates according to least effort, greatest shared resources principles, to deliver the dimensional mu ltiphasing demanded by the evolution of the participating quantum consciousne ss, no more. Its efficiencies are directly a consequence of required soul growth efficiencies. 12. So, we must accept the possibility of true dime nsional divergence at the Earthly global leve1 of mass-quantum singularity. 13. Our local to global to solar physical embodied space-time universe, is tuned to the reality feedback and growth mechanism we want. 14. The guidelines of why certain souls select different global reality timelines, or futures, or divergent causation vectors are complex. N ecessarily accommodating universes respond to soul growth choices to permit mutually exclusive consequential space-time paths."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"    13 15. While it is not a 'many universes' argument wh ere it is assumed all different choices are all 'existing', it is a 'necessary-universes' model, where only actually quantum eventuated paths exist. 16 The necessary universes model disallows alternate timeline generation that has no motivating co-creative participating quantum soul agencies. 17. One of the fractally embedded, quantum energy functions that support high variance of soul growth media while bodily and physically limited to a singular space-time global regularity, is the ability for dreaming. Dreaming is another prime probabilistic quantum accommodative feature of dimensionally enfolded growth. 18. Dreams occur on near or far variant quantum phase positions relative to our own physical world. Dreaming different 'physical wo rlds' can be individually accommodated and generated by individual soul growth accommoda tion due to morphically resonant soul growth issues. 19. This is possible and happens all the time because each individual soul is, more or less, really a wholly independent quantum creative singular ity agency, we are each inhabiting our own universe, usually joined together with ot hers in concert while physically awake. 20. The dream world physicality is actuated in dreaming as our own individual vertical or parallel or past or future \"worldline \" excursions of quantum phase position. 21. Quantum world actualization exists in dreaming, but it is locally limited to our personal, individual quantum energy creation, which wh ile in REM dreaming functions outside the normal joined together world. Outside the norma l joined worldline, operating in concert, as quantum co-created tangible an d persistent physical world. Fifth Ark: Divergent Trajectories of the Quantum Global Earth 1. There is a dynamic living universe able to res pond to many different needs of soul growth, and even warp itself to us to fit our choices, both individually and as groups. 2. We as a species are approaching an immense global reality divergence event nexus that, thankfully, has been a moving target of recent based on the surprising evolutionary progress of humanity in recent years. 3. This convergence-divergence nexus is not passabl e without every soul being involved in one of the major quantum phase group paths. It is in everyone's future. But it may happen at different times for people. 4. Global, group synchronized temporal divergence events, can happen as a sequence of dimensional split-off synchronized events. Usually one mass-quantum bifurcation or trifurcation event is all that is co-creationally supported because of multi-phase resonance complexities and polarized soul group momentum."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"    14 5. The inevitable event is that occurring within the next 1 to 12 years, a multidimensional convergence of growth promoting discontinuitie s and/or striking coherences, will occur. 6. All of these coming transformation events is the culmination of our current global group of souls in their evolutionary development to bi rth or abort a new human species, a new world, and a new spirituality. 7. This culmination will occur whether we are conscious or not at the time of the universes actualized consequences. It is our personal choice to resonate out or into or with one branch of bifurcation versus another. For each human being, personally, this is a personal choice, based on how they have chosen to grow. 8. The kinds of choices that divide realities into two are classified as global paradigm causational state-space vectors of mass volition. Each global vector is a different causational cohesion of mutual participant soul realities. 9. Each separating timeline is a differently tuned resonant universe actuality pump. 10.Each phase grouped universe is a volitional para digm, a signature pattern of growth, that generates its own meta- phased space-time reality. 11.Each different global singularity is a variant phase copy of the original signal dividing into two parts through non-mutual, detraining counter-resonance. 12.This bifurcation is a dimensional fabric m itosis of one space-time accretion as a hyper-planar existence into two hyperplanes. The bifurca tion creates two, separated linear continuity basins in the meta-continuum environment of hyper-toroidal, hyper-space-time. It generates out of one ancestor, two or mo re phased space-time mass-quantum singularities as descendents, yet all still coincident around the space zero point super-singularity. Sixth Ark: Three Global Futures Immediately Before Us 1. Each of us is personally participating, whet her we are active or passive participators, in a universe of shared consequence between ma ny souls, at a physical concrete level. 2. Assume there are at least three different global bifurcations coming, and that a each of them will produce more than two outcome sequences from the originating sequences, assuming the first order bifurcations do not happen all at the same relative time or trigger event. 3. The three major eventual paths can be divided into Best, Medium and Worst case different worlds of Earth. 4. The best case survives without catastrophi c civilization stopping events, from terminal geocosmic fate or human folly. 5. The medium case assumes some civilization disr upting, but not stopping series of events that cumulatively can still end current civilization in the longer run."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"    15 6. The worst case is human earth civilization is stopped in its tracks, with majority loss of humanity and the environment, and only many various global split-offs subsequently occur for different souls, depending on what cycle or recycle of temporal s oul growth fulfillment they are attempting. 7. In the worst case mass-quantum singularity path , for souls whose physical bodies are killed in calamitous events, that's another story. For those that remain, a painful, divergent set of paths develop. Some of these paths, while extremely different, appear to coexist in the same global vector. 8. The principal reasons people choose to be in one of these three different realities: Worst Case Nightmare Earth Vector: Cosmic disaster hits Earth Fear, suffering, pain, guilt motivated Crisis, destruction, emergency motivated Warrior paradigm, controlling things Refusal to grow up, desire to punish and hurt others Refusal to think or feel (numbness), displaced focus of soul Resonance of cynicism center of gravity Medium Case Mediocre Earth Vector: Human Disaster hits Earth Hurt/help, suffering/compassion, pain/pleasure motivated Difficulty, dissonant, fence sitting apathetic Vaccillating archetypal energy loyalties Young adult that keeps slipping, desire to struggle and control Narrow minded and narrow feeling Resonance of skepticism center of gravity Best Case Dream Earth Vector: Human Solutions save Earth Love, joy, happiness, forgiveness motivated Enchantment, creativity, opportunity motivated Adventurer paradigm, mutual cocreating Mature principles and action, desire for grace and cocreation Thoughtful, sensitive, passionate, open Resonance of optimism as center of gravity 9. There are both geocosmic and human folly causations of different divergent global future world eventualities. 10. In the best case dream Earth vector, all the cosmic rough phenomena turns out to merely be human system assimilated evolutionary booster energy sources. 11. But to those not ready to ride into that vector, these events can be life-threatening, as the medium or worst case will attest. 12. For some there is only 'sink', some there is ‘stall’, and some only swim is the only option' in their path in general environmental terms. The coming events of cosmic scale incoming energies, whether planetary, solar, or co smic, provide an energy boosting function for whatever volitional group vector is in the offing, whether best, medium or worst case global vector, as the three currently active resonance pools."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"    16 13. Whatever vector we co-creatively occupy, based on the operating resonances and entrainment forces in play, we move into phase interlock with the souls of that common resonance. Seventh Ark: Three Distinct Earthl y Resonance Pools of Soul Growth 1. Global evolutionary discontinuity events are why experiential reality manipulation is important, that mass public opinion stability is so critical today. 2. Denial that certain paths of causational and s oul reality exist, can indeed be a factor in preventing individual participation in those realities. 3. In an interdimensionaI war effort environmen t, 'plausible denial' by the conscious awareness of human individuals remains a formidable weapon in the arsenal for preventing hostile alien incursion into the mass consciousness and ultimately physical reality of our current world. In existential resonance terms, the terms that help to entrain souls into one future or another for variant growth purposes, ‘denial’ is a formid able protective weapon, in quantum volitional terms. 4. The current world is a confluence of three major tracks of pre-discontinuity souls, of which many are fairly solidly determined to be in one particular of the three main vectors. 5. For some souls presently, there is a slow but substantial migration from worse to better vector resonance inhabitation. Very few are migrating to a worse vector from what vector they are predisposing themselves to already. 6. On first order trans-temporal inspection, there is virtual resonant occ upancy in three separate primary resonance pools that are expected to each go their separate global-singularity way, split, when sufficiently high magnitude cosmic or human discontinuities hit and thereby create a global quantum worldline bifurcation trigger or detonator. 7. The best casers will assimilate the growth boos ter without it needing to become as physically evident as a so called negatively motivating force, (since other physical force obviating motivating factors are in force). The worst casers will assimilate the discontinuities as a 'growth booster' in its fully evident physically fearfully confronting form, since they have opted away from more subtly motivating systems as an evolutionary option. 8. Currently we live in confluent, fused, tri-vector potential reality, where all three global future vector potentials are aggregately still conflu enced as one phase-locked singular global set until they separate. Thank God a nd Goddess this is so, for without it, the whole would split sooner, denying the chance for any sheltered mig ration into better worldline futures by fence sitters. 9. The coming discontinuities can and will knock out one or more or all of the divergent potentiating vectors, splitting from the fused st ream we have right now. The longer we can keep the tri-polar streams fused, the more love evolution may be accomplished, being the primary goal of creation. 10. The three probable global divergent generative global/local singularity reality trajectories:"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"    17 A: No Revelation Catastrophies - lock-on w ith a portion of the quantum soul populace. This is a rapidly growing group, and the newest group overall. B: Some Earth Changes but livable – lock-on with a portion of the soul populace. This has been the most rapid growing group. C: Worldwide Catastrophes - lock-on with a portion of the soul populace. This group has been rapidly reducing and jumping up here and there but mostly reducing in ranks. 11. If all three global singularity paths do happen due to various complex triggers, it is probable most have mutual causal event structure, and are not a monolithic short duration event. We can begin to classify the causational vectors that influence each of these three coming global singularities. How do individual souls phase in and out and between these three global dimensional phase divergent sets of space-time singularity? By mutuality of resonance, that is the vector they automatically co-sign into, a voluntary global reality contract. 12. Right now, as crossover between these three global phase basins is easiest, as they are still one, since they are largely fused for a while, a we get closer and closer to the more intensely concentrated dimensional migration 'push events', and stress points, what are the thresholds, the soul-choice factors that should place you in one trajectory versus another? 13. The most feared global quantum singularity trajectory is 'C', though 'B' still will require tremendous adaptations on the part of humanity to preserve civilization. WORST CASE Trajectory 'C' includes any number of subset combination of worldwide runaway events: earthquake, flood, disease, vulcanism, poisoned air and water, EMP, radiation events, sea rise, Y2K, famine, cosmic whack - some near ELE a la 'Contact' (Extinction Level Event). There is a few survivors, and plenty of vying ET activity, both helping (assisting reconstruction) and hurting (soul stealing and global political machinations). Revelations-like sequence of horrific events. Most die. EXPECTED CASE Trajectory 'B' is also some mostly survivable subset of the above, although a largely survivable event intensity is the norm, for most of the world. 1st world civilization as we know does not come to a grindi ng halt. It has a flat tire or two or three, but the car still eventually runs, with tran sistors and we make it through the next ten years. And there is little or no ET contact in any earth changing sense, except on a incognito personal or small group basis. Some lost lands, some scuffed knees, some famine, some quaking, some vulcanism, some sea rise, some cosmic EMP like events, but all withstandable. BEST CASE Trajectory 'A' is largely free of civilization impairing events. A lot of solutions to critical problems happen. Serious progress is made in defusing the Islamic Terrorist Jihad threat through efforts of peace. Fantastic influence by exceptional individuals align enough souls to transmute, transform, and transcend many negative potentials. Once economic and class warfare, race warfare, and religious warfare volatilities are energetically defused, disarmed, intercepted, re-framed, reduced and dissipated, constructive integr ation towards a flourishing future occurs. Science becomes married to the spiritual, economics and capitalism married to human potential and its bankability, and optimal environmental symbiotics. And most importantly,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"    18 personal human spirituality becomes married to the progress of love in the universe, without needing to get kicked in the pants. 14. In each trajectory, after the initial bifurcating push off events, there are subsequent split-offs and variants that occur, however mostly embe dded and enfolded within one of three global collective quantum space-time singularities. Eighth Ark: Emotional Resonance and Quantum Entrainment, Not Entrapment 1. From this beginning, shaky as it is, the original future lines are commenced and, in time, in their full individual blossoming, there will be souls migrating back to this time of the great push off event complex, and attempt to make causational residence course adjustments. 2. These timeline adjustments will occur even to the point of entirely ju mping reality trajectory history into one of the better main lines that ‘already' happens following the push off event. 3. The three main trajectories occur and thei r first trans-time echo in hyper-time produces a loop back migration of souls wanting to catch a better ride, more conducive to the evolutionary imperative of which they are now aware. 4. Catching the better ride cannot be faked somehow. The ride you take is based on what you in co-creation with your higher soul-self feels you need to authentically grow the fastest. 5. Those that grow best with major emergency as their fear based motivation for change and daily touchstone, may take the worst or medium case path. 6. Those that grow best with only powerful b eauty and love as their motivation and daily touchstone, may take the me dium or best case path. 7. Those that fall in between, into the medium case, will in the near discontinuity echoes be repeatedly checked for readiness to either sink or swim, through crisis, with fear or love, cruelty or kindness, and will have a mixed bag of challenges that can spin one over into a better or worse case heading. 8. Best case path souls can ameliorate and effect an umbrella for Medium and Worst case path souls to inhabit, as grace to be in a less harsh world, but Worst case and Medium case motivating souls cannot move their global destruction into the Best case path. 9. Emotional resonance tickets to Best case attractor path: LOVE JOY  CARING BEAUTY COMPASSION TRUST FORGIVING HEALING BELONGING ACTIVELY PRO-ACTIVE Morphics: No global blueprint, new, programmed by yourself with spirit Spiritual reality feedback loop is soul focus (all-one, as-above-so-below) Expression focused"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"    19 Mutual Causal paradigm centered 10.

Physical reality feedback loop is soul focus (Life-and-death-struggle) Oppression focused Random Process paradigm centered 12. The reason people continue to inhabit all the dimensions that split, including the one they 'left', is complex. Firstly, the dimensional phase mitosis using universal energies creates two 'equal' but differently temporally vectored ear ths as a mutual causal affair. Secondly, if your genuine soul existence has left one reality you can persist in the quantum hologram reality you left behind for another person or people who expect your presence, and you may leave there the part of your soul that wanted to continue on that path while you are now living a parallel life at the same present time but in a different quantum phase space on a different path. 13. But you may only exist as a projection of their quantum intent, as a dreamed person who yet is physical and seemingly separate all the same . In effect that person grants the phantom 'shell' you full physical existence in their real world reality, to the point they create a 'real' you that you yourself may not know or experience, since you, as a continuing point of focused consciousness in a wave of quantum creati on, are now gone. It is not as big a deal as it seems. 14. Or you may yourself have mixed intents and s oul growth desires, and end-up splitting off a soul segment to pursue the alternate reality vector to cover both sets of ground, learning wise. One way or another, you phase lock into one vector, and sometime more than one of the three primary field paths, and then deal with the consequences."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"    20 15. The larger picture entails detailing some addi tional variant global quantum bifurcations that happen to each of the three once they have bifurcated from the one-has-all worldline we now inhabit. Ninth Ark: Embedded Networks of Alternate Space and Time 1. There have been a number of significant previous global quantum temporal accretion bifurcations that have already happene d to the earth over the last 40 years. 2. We continue to exist in a world that holds a resonance that has not destroyed itself. 3. The dimensional sifting of soul resonances into different groups desiring different growth promoting 'discontinuities', holds that whomever exists in our own global reality vector is somehow a common soul. 4. It holds that whatever souls on a mass level that we coexist with in the present are souls that chose the same path as we did in the l onger global pathway of divergent dimensional accommodation. 5. Personal split-offs can occur to accommodate different real paths of growth. 6. A path of growth, is any path that helps one to learn, immediately or ultimately, about love. That is the 'singular' singularity creation factor. 7. If the only way you can develop an ability to l ove and to learn to receive love is under great stress and with pain and great suffering then you are personally resonating to join a universe that has those supporting collective operating stresses and attributes. 8. Once the major first order bifurcations occur, there will be a time that souls who took a path they can improve upon will have the chance in so me cases, to jump over to the other vector that has recently occurred. 9. The longer the global Earth realities diverge in time and causation, the less likely there is enough individual energy to make the leap across the quantum phase gulf, and the soul more or less gets caught in the gravity well of that phase of global Earth space-time. The simple picture is one of boats going separate paths, a nd for a while you can step across, another short while leap across, another while swim across, and soon the other boat is out of sight. 10. The global grace factor is that mass volition generating the best case future Earth allows for causational 'sheltering', or 'carry-in' co-reside ncy of people that would otherwise 'normally' be in a worse case future course reality vector. But 'sheltering' still requires choice and willingness of individual souls to inhabit the mo re optimal vector, and in-that sense there is no free ride. 11. Volitional agencies of the best case future are more fully inclusive of the variety of life experienced on Earth. This is an unconditona lity, suspension of any spiritual judgment based on behavior, seeing only the best in othe rs, and bringing it out by the soul entraining forces of authentic love and caring. They are seeing inherent spiritual worth in all things,"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"    21 knowing all things are alive, that the univers e is a diversity of differentiated souls and material agencies in cooperative, inter-accommodating, co-evolution. 12. With this, there comes a personal level selected global participation bifurcation that is allowed and cushioned to occur. 13. The part of the soul personality expression bound and determined to stick with low road growth tactics, can co ahead and truly live so me version of the expected negative future reality. 14. The part of the soul personality that is willing to grow with more gentle motivators, and face the challenges of change, will resonate into this available positive future, a more optimal phase-space singularity. 15. Some souls will be splitting their conscious point of focus into growth patterns in more than one singular future bifurcation path, since th at is an economical, multi-path manner in which to grow. 16. Some souls will not be generating a soul split off, but will be holding their resonance in one or another of the main future vectors along. 17. Opportunity and ability to migrate into mo re optimal vector futures is dependent on individual choice as demonstrated by 'who' they have become in life. 18. Entrance into Earthly physical future heaven or hell is not psyc hosocial consciousness entrainment as much as individual persona l option, as phase-resonant association. 19. Personal choices, attitudes, beliefs, thoughts and feelings beco me either toxic or nutritive to being in one future vector or other. 20. It is complicated in description, but simple in experience. From a soul's higher point of view, knowledge, intelligence, and mental creativity, when operating without love, compassion and empathy, in the Omega an alysis, is always considered a doomed evolutionary track. In the long run it conde mns most varieties of free-willing emotional energetics as interference to mental contro1 and static perfections at all levels. Mind is at odds with the heart on a grand evolutionary sc ale. Mind applied without any context of compassion and empathy for the world, is a form of evolutionary insanity, however permitted and explored by many. Tenth Ark: Future Timeline Re-Engineering for Soul Growth 1. Many time traveling visitors, with some help here and there, are looping back from dead- end future worldline mega-vectors, vectors that on first order trans-time propagation from what is coming will have happened. They are looping back directly back to this point in their own historical vector genesis, and doing a umber of things. 2. Some are trying to alter their own future to a more optimal course, which depending on who you are can mean different things. \u0001"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"    22 3. To mind-without-heart, control-oriented nega tive-future evolutionary advocates, they have time travelers specifically coming back into our pre-discontinuity late 20th century global temporal stream to get more converts. 4. Some are actively attempting to prevent certain courses of development from occurring that can endanger their own selfish future. Men-in-black fit this profile. 5. Some time travelers are going back in to try to harvest more souls into their mass singularity cause, since their own future reality wants quantum reinforcement. 6. Loopback time travelers are largely looking to shift some outcome that is reflective in their future from which they looped back. The thought is if key precipitating events are changed, which otherwise would have le d to a given very undesired outcome, then the mass soul migration into that future may be changed. 7. Some time travelers want to avert sequences, others want to amplify a sequence. 8. The question is, newly sequence to where? In Om ega analysis, more love is always and only the answer. In the interim analysis, pain can be an indicator of the degree of absence of love. 9. Because of the successful efforts of some first generation loopback time travelers, second order future consequence vectors have propagated through transtime. 10.The reality and the residents of the first order sequence still exist, but as much of their soul energy and conscious focus is migrating to the ne wer alternate future, the original future is effectively retracted, although remembered if desired. 11.Optimal timeline soul migration e ffectively attenuates the singul arity energy associated with that original less optimal negative future vector. 12.Each global future vector is comprised of a group of co-creating quantum soul agencies. 13.Second future loopback (feedback) time travelers also exist. They are again trying to correct course, further refine global or regional or personal soul growth vectors. It is a form of macro-temporal feedback regulati on, or worldline re-steering. 14.Second future loopback travelers, can generate, and have generated, so me third order future Earth propagation's through transtime. 15.The interesting fact is that all these travel ers are coming back during this pre-discontinuity, pre-global bifurcation period to do their stuff. 16. Most time travelers don't know of each other for the most part, but still all attempt to operate as temporal singularity piano-tuners. 17. Where will it all end-up? Stay tuned, or shall we say, get tuned up. Watch out for temporal piano tuners wanting to tune you into th eir mass quantum vector. Apathy gets the booby prize."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"    23 18. Many time traveling visitors, ET visitors, interdimensional visitors and observers galore from afar, are all converging to watch the co ming resonance wave that is culminating on Earth, the coming establishment of reality vectoring resonance and resonances that will spawn a range of future Earth bifurcation space-time vectors. 19. Why are they here to watch? These futures c ould very seriously influence temporal soul growth rates and vectors in the universe at larg e, vectors that are far, far beyond our Earthly sphere. 20. The implication of the coming discontinuity wave of standing resonance and each human soul agency's participation in it, is that depending how you energetically hold the wholeness of who you are and the world at large, selects which global bifurcation path you will be thrown into when the discontinuities hit. 21. Make no mistake, the presence of self, love, caring, empathy, and forgiveness, are the touchstones that autoselect a human being into the more optimal reality vector. 22. Willingness to be motivated to grow your soul by love and joy, is a soul phase-locking into the future Earth vector that supports and substantiates this. Willingness to only be motivated by fear and pain, places a soul into the reality that corroborates this modus operandi for growth. From the higher soul's point of view, either path will eventually get the soul growth job done. Eleventh Ark: Soul Populaces in Different Quantum Global Vectors 1. People on Earth currently divide into largely three categories, love involved people, apathy involved people, fear and hatred involved people. 2. Love leads to the ways of embracing, apathy l eads to ways of isolation and numbness, and fear and hatred lead to the ways of control and manipulation. 3. Depending on the soul's touchstones of grow th, as a summed resonance complex, personal center of gravity of phase entrainment makes the difference as to which mass quantum Earth timeline someone ends up vectoring towards. 4. Some optimal vector advocates are vowing to ta ke all the dismal vector adherents with them into their vector, if willing. 5. Can we stand the idea that there is no n eed for a catastrophic species-level reboot of humanity? That maybe we are really in for an upgrade instead?? 6. If you can't stand a minimum-pain scenario, then it options that part of your conscious expressing soul into the more negative outcome vectored future. 7. The worst case future still remains to bifurcate off, for those conscious souls whom are bound to stay their negative course. But for those worst case future predispositioned conscious souls, the best case conscious souls are offering easy refuge in their flourishing future vector, if willing."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"    24 8. The act of forgiveness takes a leap of paradi gm in the whole conscious soul operating style. But the waveguide is there, nonetheless, offeri ng soul passage to entrain into higher phase torsion. This is possible given inherent clues within the conscious soul that energetically qualify them at more minimal threshold or phase lock entry into a more gently, best case vectored future. 9. The simplicity of it is understanding that goodness and badness, goodwill and bad will, refusal to grow, think or feel, are not really good or bad in absolute terms, rather they are either elegant or inelegant chosen paths of soul growth. 10. You get what you ask for. The universe accomm odates the quantum cocreative request of the participating souls. Ask and ye shall receive is true in this instance. 11. In this light it should become clear how it is also okay to trust in Allah and still see it fit to tie up your camel. There is no contradiction in e xpecting the best and preparing for something considerably worse. So long as your genuine authentic conscious desire and prayer is directed to the more optimal outcome. 12. It is in your hands, personally. It is not out of your hands and only in the hands of God. 13. The whole point of evolutionary culminations are to boost the growth of life not kill it. 14. The idea of the discontinuity being a globally destructive event is only mass volitional quantum viable assuming a real need to re-boot humanity and civiliza tion, and assumes an evolutionary dead-end situation is happening that deserves pre-emptive dead-ending, as if to promote some envisioned rebirth of humanity. This could occur if the judgment of humanity was at hand, but God likes this action too much to mess with the works, now that there are very real signs of very powerful love evolving on this planet. 15. So with regards to the grace factor, the question comes down to this: Is there love enough in the world for the entire world? And how much of the world is willing to be cushioned in that context? 16. If you are resonant to the best case dream future vector, \"you know there is\" and are actively involved in your own way to make sure of it, especially. (Optimist, dreamer, unselfish, unique, forgiving). 17. If you are resonant to the medium case mediocre future vector, \"you doubt it, but have hopes otherwise that it could be possible\". (Realist. skeptic, insincere, fence-sitting, preoccupied). 18. If you resonant to the worst case night1are future vector, \"you know there isn't, and are actively involved in your way to confirm there isn' t, especially since you're in pain\".

However, at current, half of the whole planetary population will upgrade to the best case precisely because of the existence of the self operating best case souls. At this time of measuring, almost two th irds are heading into the best case vector. Only ten years ago, only 3% were self operating the achievement of that vector. So reaching 15% has permitted a graceful migration path into the best case future vector for half of humanity. 21. In 1980, the soul population on Earth vectoring for worst case future was almost 40%, so a tremendous growth curve has been achieved in th e last twenty years, in addition to more recent generations of people havi ng stronger attraction to the better case vectoring. There is a lot of people waking up spiritually now and a lot of children being born with extraordinary spiritual aptitudes. 22. However, the tag-a-longs from medium and wo rst case vector predisposition, cannot coast, or they will slip. The mass temporal soul path vector upgrade is not a free lunch, it depends on taking the opportunity, not living off it. 23.

The current status is that although many predic ted global events have changed, they are still strongly resonant in the trans-temporal matrix. 2. As a result, people will still see these negative futures in visions, dreams, and remote viewing. 3. However, the timetable has changed and the ev ent sequence has changed. Certain predicted events will still happen, but at such a low magn itude that they will be growth boosting events, not life stopping ones. The cosmos is adjusting its energetics to accommodate this shift. 4. The future can still hold the worst case future however, but it will now be very precisely generated only by acts of human folly, not acts of God. 5. All of the previous visionarily seen events, horrors, Earth changes, can all still result as a sequence of negative actions by humanity on itself. 6. This will force the conscious geosphere to effect serious damage arresting action: precipitating earthquakes, vulcanism, sea level rises, poisoned air and water, lethal weather, mass death, disease, and loss of most of humanity, if not all eventually. 7. The only way is to avert and dismantle it, to disarm and defuse the negative future vectoring forces. 8. The negative vectoring future forces essentially will continue to make their best attempt within the next thirteen years to keep people as leep or ally them into their negative future. 9. Is your number one ally fear, love, or apathy? Pain, compassion, or indifference? Control, service, or passivity? In the final analysis, it is not one feature is judgmentally better than another, but is the willingness and \"creative-em otional-mobility\" enabled in the evolutionary sense. 10.The more willing and emotionally mobile you are, the more gentle the reality feedback system can function. 11.The more refusing and immobile you are, th e more harsh and externally undeniable the reality feedback system functions. 12.Reality gives you what you need as a conscious soul, not necessarily what you think you want. Feelings and emotional make-up dictate future Earth timeline vectoring more than anything. 13.The words of the great prophets, seers, and savior s, all say the same thing, but in parable and prosaic terms. Love is the answer, especially when hate is the question."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"    27 14. On increasing love, the only operational issue is 'how', not why. The re-vectoring, or enablement of yourself to track into a more optimal future, is a function of learning about love, in all ways. 15. Decoy emotions and feigned conscience will not let souls con their way into a temporal future upgrade. There is no fooling ourselves, since it is all based on actualized soul growth and operating growth style as self-selected by how they phase-torsionally vibrate. This is self selection into one global temporal vector or another based on evident emotional resonance factors, not by some declaration by the mind. Thirteenth Ark: Time Density, Space Torsion, How Life Curls in Space-time 1. The present time of our serial timestream of physical reality is a concentrated traveling wavefront. 2. The moment of the present is a mutual c ontinuing experience in synchronization with our local spatio-temporally cohesive universe. 3. Present time is a complex, mutually entrained harmonic quantum event, between observers as they intersect in the space-time singularity of the one reality we know, as we exist in it, together, in cooperative cohesion. 4. Time has individual field scale embedde d layers, pockets, greater or lower density concentrations of relative local motion, and complexity. Local motion propagates it's electromagnetic signature across spacetime at relativistic speeds. Different rates and patterns of motion each generate a spacetime fi eld curvature ripple at relativistic speeds. The larger spacetime fabric can be likened to having volumetric density, based on different local pressures of time as measured in te rms of many kinds of descriptive temporal relativism, including: Measure: __________________ Qualifier: _______________ Example: Rate of Random Motion as Discontinuous Linearity radioactive decay Rate of Periodicity as Sequen tial Linearity day and night Degree Fractal Repetition as Novelty of Patterns repetition across scale Homeostasis Regulation as Temporal Embedding limit cycle basins Scalar Cohesion as Energetic Synchronizing phase conjugation Morphic Field Process as Process Non-Linearity co-invention 5.

Time pockets are spatially and temporally local basins of higher temporal complexity, embedded in the overall lower complexity singularity surface we inhabit together. 11. Time in this conception is partially an 'addi tive' synthesis function, with time density coupled out of local contributing causational complexity. 12. Occasionally, temporal density in a given loca lity can be extremely high, thereby able to squeeze tremendous relativistic motion into a ve ry limited density pocket, despite spatially surrounding temporal relativistic metric stress pressures. 13. Time is also partially a 'subtractive' synthesis function of basin eddy variation limits within immediate enveloping temporal to rsional wavefield scale. These are coupled space-time accretion field pressures that limit local density packing, but do not order it, in relative space-time. 14.

The aggregate circulating frequencies of differentiated but common, volitional influence, produce a cocreated space-time mass, as well as phase-fit within existing space-time mass.

The hemisphere is the expressed yang point of the quantum actualization engine. 5. The twists the wave makes between toroidal hemisphere and center are the trajectories of possibility into possibility squared as streams of probability, and some fully accreted, as probability squared (possibility cubed) manifest physical actuality. 6.

Temporal spatial density depends on vital soul force energy levels, and associated variety and complexity of relative motion. 17. In general, higher lifeforce complexity produ ces higher spatial compression of temporal incrementation and encyclic enfoldment whic h produces a space-time fabric depression, representing the increased regional pressure of temporal causational density. 18. A current expression of linear causational flow s generates a trans-time propagated probable matrix profile of reflections of consequence. 19. The trans-time matrix is a virtual collective of temporal propagation and consequence, as a trans-time accretion. 20. The trans-time matrix is reflectively generating a probable linear flow consequence, in advance, throughout the entire temporal extent of macro-quantum singularity motion from the present condition. 21.

To the relative point of the view of a conscious point of focus of an individual soul in the current present time moment, the future exists as vector from this genesis moment. 24.

The mutual consensus world has a mutually effective blueprint for its state-space evolutionary track - its probable sequence eventualities. These probable sequence eventualities exist for a given resident space-time universe, with its inherent potentiating diversity and change. 11.

As individual universal singularities embedded in a co-created mutual singularity universe, we are in not only in a consensus reality together, we are in a co-created space-time cohesion basin together, which collectively fo rms a mutual singularity universe. 2. Occasionally there is sufficient divergence of co-creative volitional intent to have a number of souls separate from one co-created mutual uni versal consensus quantum singularity into two different sets of co-created mutual singularity. 3. There is a quantum physics of diverging voli tional intent that can exceed singularity phase domain cohesion. This is where culminations fro m one reality singularity and its associated causal event stream, split into two separate pha se states of the whole stream of spatio- temporal dimensional continuity. 4. Dimensional reality mitosis starts with a si ngle spatio-temporal parent, 'the agreed upon past’. 5. The hyperphysics of cohesion of a space-time dimensional continuum, is analogous to phase locked fundamental base freque ncy and harmonics. The base frequency is a measure of both frequency constant and relative a ssociate phase locked harmonics, and as a whole establishes a given absolute metaphase position in quantum probability. 6. When macro-quantum space-time singularities ar e bifurcated, or birthed, it occurs from a single parent due to collective divergence of volition that is mutually exclusive. 7. The original whole singularity system phase position fishtails and wobbles its center to effectively counter-resonate against itself to separate into two relatively diametric or orthogonal children singularity frequencies and phase positions. Two different metaphase positions, or different dimensional hyperphase absolute positions are generated as a consequence. 8. By deviating from the threshold of local quantum volitional convergence, the local boundary of collective volitional cohesion is breaches, a nd the originating phase locked singularity splits into two separately cohesive phase sate wavefront culminations of the originating singularity and sequence. 9. Additionally, real-space singularities can be fr actally embedded within another, and thereby many locally mutually exclusive proximal phase variants of different dimensional sequences can be embedded within one dime nsional phase and sequence at a higher level of scale. This embedding feature provides a range of economical, elegant least effort path distribution of collective volitional accretion energies. 10. Each separate space-time singularity system is at a golden mean phase difference to the next universal collective singularity, in order to phase isolate the energetics of differently self consistent vortical systems. The singularities ma y co-exist in the same meta-space, but in different non-interacting phases of that space. 11.

An analogy is musical octaves and harmonics . The lowest octave note is the fundamental 'carrier', and is the longest wavelength in spa tial terms. The fundamental note can be likened to the largest time-space singularity culminated dimension of cohesion. There is, for the fundamental note, a series of individual fam ily of harmonic frequencies, all phase locked within the oscillation cycle and metapha se position of the fundamental tone. 14.Within the fundamental tone, and all its derivative harmonics, there is a measure of phase variance permissible in relative terms between them, while still being effectively entrained within the overall phase locked oscillatory system. There is an effective frequency variety permissible within the phase unity, or harmonic homeostasis, of the system. 15.If a fundamental singularity begins to vary its wavephase too much and too quickly due to divergent volitional culmination, it generate s a resonance-counter-resonance event that produces a bifurcation of the energy involved into two different pa rallel, separate, and harmonically non-interactive quantum phases of macrocosmic singularity. They develop orthogonally to each other, generatively centering into two non-interacting, different phase basins. 16.Conservation of volitional culmination in a ny macro-quantum frequency and phasespace of universal time-space singularity, produces a limited temporal stream of alternate probable causal sequences, based on the alternately cu lminating, locally coope rative participating volitional participants. 17.The conservation of collective volitional culmination entrains minor variances and deviance's into subordinate positioning in a single causal sequence eventuality. 18.Major collective divergence of volitional ener gies can and will generate a counterpositioning into more than one eventual sequence outco me, where each will occupy their own temporal phase of quantum state-space. 19.There is no violation of physical laws in a time-space singularity bifurcation event, since to the phase locked, self entraining, linear seque nce of space-time, as the creation of another separately phased locked reality, is a natural process of migrating volitional energies into an available phasespace side-band position. 20.The originating space-time causality matrix produces, by volitionally divergent choice, a secondary causality sequence. This second singularity, is projected from and created by the collective volitional 'energetic' participants. The volitional energy preference that generated the different future sequence no longer exists within the original singularity, as it has shifted to the second sequence eventuality. 21.

The solution of the paradox derives from the individual freedom of c hoice that associates a volitional source (soul) in or out of the volitional collective consensus agreement singularity, in or out of the singular macro-quantum phasespace reality. Seventeenth Ark: Conscious Personal Continuity and Truth 1. Within a given physical cycle of existen ce a bifurcation of soul energy can occur to accommodate two mutually exclusive life path choices. This means that other versions of oneself can exist in other phases of time-space that each accommodate a volitionally useful variance in spiritual evolution. 2. If a volitional agency (a soul) migrates out of one macro-collective-singularity into another, their presence in the abandoned singularity co ntinues, minus the volitional energy (soul components) that have migrated. 3. Therefore, the body does not migrate, only a portion of the soul, with its functioning energy body, migrates. 4. From the view of the migrating soul component, there is no conscious difference, as the abandoned singularity does not exist to them. In their reality they were not hit by a bus like in the one they would have been if they had not exited. They have moved into another chosen temporal accretion eventuality. 5.

There may be the same newspaper headlines at a largest scale but several mutually exclusive dimensionally orthogonal back-page stories on a local scale. 14. At the highest levels of perception and meta-r eality, there is only one singularity, one soul, and one volition that is self-reflecting, or phase-space fractally pr opagating, and expanding into an optimal requisite variety set of required derivative evolutionary sequences. This requisite variety supports all the volitionally desired diversity of evolutionary process. 15. In each alternate singularity reflection, in each insular center of entrained phase position, in each alternate center of volitional gravity, exists a hidden unity of all centers. 16. At the meta-temporal, hyperspatial carrier medi um, the creating energy for all reflections is equivalent to any i ndividual reflection. 17. The paradox of small and large, individual and collective, unity and separation, are resolved in the apprehension of the whole system as a me ta-verse of reflections of one meta-universal singularity.

Timeline engineering is rampantly active upon our current temporal nexus of singularity, since the extreme evolutionary acceleration event that is coming will spawn several mutually exclusive singularity universes that will, in their own futural timing, need to return to this birth event to trimtab their evolutionary heading. 5.

The coming temporal discontinuity is a confluence event that implosively coheres into several different time-space macro-singularity phase center s. Each phase center or basin functions as its own independent energy sharing system, and thus several major future timelines branch out. 9. These separate, insular futures, have in many cases developed undesired long term consequences for the soul evolution of the volitional participants. 10. With spiritual or physical technology, some re sident volitional partic ipants (souls) have chosen to attempt to return to a greater point of influence, and change, repair, salvage, or heal by means of back-propagating their soul and sometimes body components up their originating timeline to the point of the maximally sensitive volitional butterfly effect that generated their line its collective momentum.

From one view, the only difference between dream and reality, is quantum relativistic “probability” and “actuality”. This in turn is the difference between Bohm implicate order quantum enfoldment, (after a post explication manifestation event). This is the difference between morphic fields that don't or do reach our relativistic physical explication potential. 17. Manifestation history dimensionally enfolds itself relative to subsequent present time, it exists as dream information but no longer the center of gravity of lifeforce. Time and space as past or future, is relativistically enfolded."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"    42 18. Depending on evolving soul quantum-learning lo ads, scalar torsion generated by consciousness in space-time can propagate info rmation instantaneously , anywhere, to any time. All consciousness propagates morphic information and causality, outside of linear time, into non-local, trans-time reflection. 19. This super-temporal feedback loop provides \"post-event\" trans-temporal reflection \"backward\" in linear time. The future trans-time feedback loop couples back around quantum initiating \"precursor events\" which ar e quantum signal projections \"forward\" from the relative linear present. 20. This hyperspatial signature transmission sy stem is the means by which the quantum universe phase conjugates appr opriate co-creative mutuality, creation, accommodation, economy, least effort, in effective response to human quantum free-will and creative evolution. 21. The new timeline is a probability emergent into actuated physical existence. The old timeline is a once invested actuality returned to mere probability of existence. From mere possibility to probability to actuality, and back to possibility again. This is soul migration from lesser to more evolved timelines. The timelines are abandon ed or completed. Actuality recesses back to probability and ultimately me re possibility again. The soul components migrate to other more useful universal singularities of existence and evolution. 22. This is the sense of things in the long scope. It is the structure of physical dreaming by and between humans and the mutual causal creation. 23. All of the 'once created' realities exist in their own time, space and phase, with all their resident energies, but in evolutionary time. in relativistic evolutionary time, realities that succeed generate and develop more energy than ones that are abandoned. 24. The perception of life in a timeline is a function of what timelines you are looking from. 25. Each individual sees the global timeline within which they are embedded, but usually cannot seem to consciously influence it. 26. To the degree you genuinely do influence the global line, it can either move you to an alternate Earth that already exists with you in it (you got there earlier in an earlier split), or generate an entirely new timeline of global qua ntum singularity to some level of scale. 27. You need only enough volitional participants to generate a separate macro-quantum space- time universe or singularity. 28. If many individual volitional agents have symmetry of evolutionary intent together, then they morphically associate or join to cocreatively share consequence. This is a least effort, minimum duplication law of universal like-attracts-like inclusion. 29. Global timelines are collective volitional accretions , consensus agreement realities. Different alternate global Earths, reflect different c onsensus agreement basins, different mutual consenting reality co-creation and involvement of a group of sentient beings operating in symmetry."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"    43 30. Again the economy of timeline creation is a cl ustering of conscious sentience in evolution along differently vectored paths of mutual ag reement. The mutual agreement between many individuals generates a global current of time that is moving its way into a distinct future. 31. Think of meta-time as an ocean, and each alternate time line as a different but nearby almost self contained current, self contained within its own phaselock to the meta-singularity, each existing in a differently coupled phase position in the encompassing hyperspace. There are little null zones, or nodes, betw een the major current trails of activity, or antinodes. 32. Continuing the ocean analogy, the regional wave s and individual water molecules all join together to produce a main current. 33. If the energy of a current is reduced enough, it can eventually stall, or decay, its constituent energies absorbed into nearby stronger cu rrents, whose wave action and water motion entrain the remaining energy into system homeostatic coherence. 34. In the temporal map of meta-history, the time of early 21st century earth is the subject of a multi-dimensional temporal energy tsunami. Twentythird Ark: Angels, Men-in-Black, ET's, Dark Future Tricksters 1. There is a time-space map that shows how to navigate the impact of this temporal discontinuity. It reveals all the major timelines and their critical and sensitive connection, overlap, and splitoff points. And it by definition must map the activities of the time travelers from the future past and future future timelines that are involved in this multi-wave event, and ongoing event reconfiguration. 2. It is an exciting time to live here in the late 20th century. In reality, it is the top destination of time travelers, so to already be here in th e first place means you don't have to invent time travel to get here. 3. Why is this discontinuity, this tsunami ev ent, this space-time wave current convergence happening? What makes Earth so special? So mehow, Earth is a key player in how and whether a whole host of very positive universal evolving timelines, or very negative universally infesting realities timelines develop in the future and propagate their influence downline. 4. We are somehow the unwitting kingpins, not pawn s, in a cosmic evolution experiment. 5. Something that happens here in coming Earth history produces several distinct different Earth dimensional splitoffs, some of which w ill be failures and some successes, spiritual evolution wise. 6. The future Earth timeline failures are the ones sending the most time travelers back to this timing to try and effect a timeline course change. 7. The most successful future Earth timelines are sending back time travelers so evolved that we might call them 'angels', and th ey have only our best spiritual growth interest in mind."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"    44 8. Time travelers from the most successful future s don't use physical time machines as they have evolved technology of mind to move their bodies across and between time. 9. The most evolved future humans in the farthe st future times don't need to return to change anything for themselves since they already made it , but they do come back to help those more unfortunate sometimes. 10. Some 'men-in-black' are inner earth indige nous humanoids. They are remnants of ancient separate civilization making rare surface saucer excursions and working with using all means to keep evidence of their own existence quiet. Then there are time traveling MIBs who are similarly protection minded, effectively time cops, doing all they can to control and guide global timeline volitional potentials. 11.Men-in-black were tasked with suppressing th e knowledge of ET and extra-dimensional (ED) contact that would hinder the volitional energy that can be harvested for reinforcing the energy and power level of their future eventuality. 12. Some might say we are in a war between alternate universes. It is not just timewars, or timeline wars, but more acutely, it is a vo litional allegiance war, with conquered populaces enslaved into negative singularity futures. 13. On the other hand, it is a opportunity for va st individual human volitional singularity (soul) migration from the future negative lines into much more positive lines, by changing the butterfly factors that our era holds. 14. And the only butterfly factor that really exists is the individual, not collective, despite all appearances, and desire to blame or credit. 15. The collective outcome is a summed convergence of individual inputs. It is personal choice influenced by collective entrainment factors. 16. There are some invasion forces from the futu re attempting to reinforce their own quantum energy, power and influence into the past present and eventually other alternate timeline dimensionalities. The men-in-black are merely the temporal street muscle of one particularly strong major negative alternate timeline. 17. The primary causes that prevent this negative line from increasing its soul harvest to reinforce its reality power, are (a) Earth's pe n contact with the right ETs, (b) true human spiritual awakening, and (c) counterbalancing effects from time travelers from more positive future lines. 18. The men in black are also interested in preventing current day development of free energy, time travel, psychic powers, contact with enemy ET or extra dimensional entities. These things all represent a threat to their negative line reinforcement activities. 19. Certain negative ET forces are willing to do anything they can to manipulatively harness the power of human spirituality as evolutionary singularity batteries for their own distorted evolution. But this only exists as a requested affair."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"    45 20. We have something certain beings don't, and they want it, and for other reasons than what was intended. 21. What we have is particularly unique and powe rful soul substance in the negative harvester's view, and if they don't take control of it, they are terrified what we win do with it against them. 22. They do not trust any volitional power that can exceed their own. They have a culture focused on control and suppression of diversity and individuality. That is a mistake, since we humans will eventually do the right thing for the universe, as is our ultimate destiny. 23. There will be a timeline convergence, implosion, explosion, and meta -eventual culmination where all failed lines are healed, revived or s oul-retrieved and abandoned, and all souls make it forward into the most successful future timelines. 24. All more negative timelines will eventually become more and more faded and conscious energy depleted and collapsed, since so much of the soul energy will have migrated into optimal tracks. Twentyfourth Ark: Souls Seeking Optimal Future Evolution for All 1. Our evolutionary space-time poc ket called Earth and its immediat e galactic environment, is an oasis of butterfly attractors that can gene rate vastly different and distinct future evolutionary tracks. 2. There is an evolutionary energy acceleration and expansion operation occurring. 3. A new optimal timeline reality has been Created by the best of the human heart and divine powers and the most evolved time traveler working with high creation spiritual forces we would call the divine or God. 4. The current major task is to converge as many souls as possible into the optimum space-time future history trajectory lines. 5. To accomplish this job, many volunteers from the successful future timelines have traveled back into their own past alternate timelines where things went wrong to help change the course. 6. This means, over the span of meta-time, there is a timeline mop-up operation, where all soul energy is assisted in its migration to more and more optimal future timelines. 7. It also means that, as a reward, humans who accomplish this task, will be granted an initially uninhabited virgin future that can beco me even more optimal beyond comparison. 8. That final loop optimal future becomes the end-game singularity conduit path through which all souls of all alternate lines will eventually travel to become qualified macro-creator agents. 9. From the higher realms point of view, all cr eative sentient beings are dreaming physicality, in an individual and mutual manner."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"    46 10.The future of the future is ours to choose and make. 11.Many futures are concordant and inherent within our current timeline, a collective blueprint playout, which depending on many critical fact ors, will diverge into several manifest independent global tem poral trajectories. 12.What exists now has many trans-temporal reflections across the linear future of what can become of it, some different event sequence lin es brighter and more probable than others. Twentyfifth Ark: Quantum Causation and the Mutable Future 1. It is all about individual development of human souls, as independent enfolded space-time singularities, as an inhabited resonance basi ns, which has frequency and phase connectivity and cohesion with the resonance of our mutual , global, collective, consistent physical macro- quantum reality. 2. So lets look at the range of events and proba bilities in play the predictions- We will go in knowing there is an alive, mutable, resonant matrix reflecting information to us from a hypertemporal system, where all probable linear causational futures are instantly propagated from any present moment and momentum. 3. A future impossibility turns to possibility turns to probability and then to 'Fine' physical reality before it happens as actuality m its own present. Only when it happens in its own present is it dense 1 actualized physical present time reality. 4 Psi-energy magnitudes for probable futures are accorded to the sum and synergy of correlating, reinforcing volitional forces that are operati ng in synchronization with that future line propagation. 5. So in the view from eternity, and etern ity cubed, Alpha through Omega, in hyper-space-time, the network web of potentiations that are mapped are not static, if the present time volitional agencies truly act in an unexpected manner. 6. All probabilities of present time actuated events generate active probabilities for future outcome sequences. Yet all outcomes are indi vidual probabilities of individual singularity agencies we call souls. 7. The process of evolution involves each soul participating in the whole. Any present time, actuated, real world effective, global timeline vector change, automatically activates a changed quantum possibility vector set for its own future. Twentysixth Ark: More Souls In the Ark of Optimal Future Trajectory 1. Conformations and deviations of soul growth courses on a global level, at the Earthly scale of macro-quantum reality, is occurring on Earth. It is outside the range of previously known expectations. 2 . To the visitors from beyond our time, only the most advanced are patently aware that the Earth has a near 50:50 chance to go either the way of incredible destruction and loss or the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"    47 way of unprecedented evolutionary acceleration in the ability to love, which is God's favorite skill. 3. Incipient reality combines with volitional initiated change based on desired futures operating as psi-energetic attractors into present time reality. 4. Physical consequence (past/present inner and pa st outer attractors) plus individual desire in present time (personal inner future attracto r) plus proximal future probabilities (outer collective attractor) feedback, all c ontribute to what ends up happening. 5. Linear time is generating a long term futura l unfoldment, yet still enfolded in quantum hyperspacetime until it becomes preset time relative to the participating volitional influences called souls. 6. The future probability growth vectors imprint an information signature into trans-time, or hypertime. 7. The quantum volitional alchemy produces a signatu re and this establishes energetic pathways and attractor behavior that entrain like signatures to contribute volitional energy - the hermetic like-attracts-like idea. 8. Futures are generated as quantum transt emporal looping reflections in hyperspace-time relative to present time. 9. Propagated probable futures feedback in pr esent time, as if looking for resonant re- forwarding effects and phase interlock in resent events, and as if reinforcement search. 10.Trans-temporal resonance from present to future, then back to present and again to a shifted future seems to be a reality of quant um hyperspatial enfolded evolution. 11.These things all accessibly exist in the information base of the continuum, in the non-local, hyper-temporal, hyperspatial, singularity accre tion horizon of space-time linear reality. 12.Where we are on the rim of our own present time continuum, in our relativistic present time, the transtime matrix can reflect back to us wherever we happen to be potentially going in the temporal causational sequence, as a superluminal, time-reverse wave. 13.Take your pick of coming global bifurcation vectors Soul Populace 2000 Vector Prediction A. \"AIl you need is love\" a.

Exceptions include souls which have no obstacles to choose to be in a more positive vector, but instead choose to ride a negative vector as a follow-up factor, a teaching, influential factor to help the population in that ni ghtmare vector make the best of it. 15. Prophets, visionaries, spiritual seers, and evol ved souls are often souls that consciously imported themselves into negative timelines to learn about them and help the indigenous population find a more loving way, as possible. 16. Actually it is a great honor, even if it is difficult to help out, to be of compassionate service of sorts. Sometimes it is merely a sense of responsibility on the part of certain souls, as a function of love, caring, and compassion to reduce suffering, or based on self-selected karmic patterns of learning. Twentyseventh Ark: Overcoming the Negative Quantum Attractors 1. The world is one. We exist together in one singularity of space-time. From the viewpoint of every individual there exists no alternate universe and there is no alternate universe The physical universe of space and time, wave and pa rticle, energy and matte r, is our mutually created evolutionary growth medium. 2. Everyone deserves to make it, and pain is not necessary. Pain and fear, or love and joy, employed as alternate linear evolutionary grow th styles, are widely divergent mediums of growth. They are paradoxical, contradictory, and mutually exclusive to a considerable degree. Yet mutually exclusive paradigms of time can re latively co-exist in one singularity universe, one global Earth, with ail its diverse, concentrated ingredients. 3. The diversity of the Earth can grow as one. No Earthly future bifurcations needs to happen. We can most if not all make it in this wave, but only if we crest it in our own participation to change the existing negative leaning momentums. 4. There is a great wave coming, a wave of co -active, co-creative, multiplier factored, quantum volitional energy. This is an evolutionary accelerant. 5. There are three major dominions of space-time in our sphere, that are converging, culminating, and co-creatively cooperating in the coming wave event: Earthly, human, and spiritual. The convergence of three major possible futures is amplified by the three major realms of resonance building evolution. 6. It is not all up to each individual, we each do our part, in our own way. We are not alone. Part of the nature of the evolutionary acceleration wave is the co-creative forces of the universe are becoming amplified for us and with us. No one is a spectator, everyone is a participant, everyone- is part of the total mix, the complete equation. 7. Divine intervention exists, but only in matching resonance with our initiated signals. Human spirituality exists, and human souls are fragments, in the image, of the creator, holisms in the creation."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"    49 8. Secular academism ignores what it cannon co mpute and disallows acknowledgement of evolution beyond Newtonian terms, reducing human spirituality and soul to 'what brains do'. This is an incomplete paradigm that promotes human spiritual dis-empowerment. 9. Traditional religions and spirituality often denies the power of individual participation, reducing souls to flocks of tacitly accepting sheep , unilaterally subject to God's will, souls not capable of and prohibited from too much i ndependent' impact, albeit free-willing who all submit to God's will, their own largely not important. The system is defined by its degree of wrathful forces attributed to Gods work, in a divine war to violently destroy the unclean, the polluted, the bad people, in order to rebuild. This is a paradigm that promotes human spiritual punishment, control, and very limited empowerment. 10. New Age religions and spirituality is often f undamentalist traditions in new clothing, newly claiming human spiritual value and human spir itual power, yet in stark contradiction, shrinking from this rhetoric when talking of coming Earth changes, as if humanity cannot change the course to anything better. Love, l ove, love, but wipe out the unclean with extreme prejudice. This is a paradigm that promotes minor mutual spiritual power, and acceptance of limited human spiritual empowerment and puni shment, as de facto, de rigeur, fait accompli, quid pro quo for bad bad humaity. Collectively speaking, we've been bad, and Daddy's coming to whip our ass. 11. Secular academic, religious and new age paradigms of human potential and spiritual impact in the co-creative universe can be relatively limited as means to empower spiritual participation. The associated sinks of pers onal identity work in a feedback loop on the personal to global level, and the mass frequencies pool into different domains. 12. When our secular and material world fails us we have economic and environmental dysfunction. Strategic risk: economic wars, local to global. 13. When our religious and community world breaks down we have human incivility and social dysfunction. Strategic risk: civil wars, local or national. Martial law, civil breakdown. 14. When our spiritual world fails us we have so cio-spiritual dysfunction. Strategic risk: global terrorist wars, local to inter national. Ar mageddon out of a New Jihad, or perhaps the Retaking of Taiwan. 15. To evolve out of the dichotomous negative secular 'reality fixation', we must work with the unexpected forces of the mother Earth and the future \"New Earth\" time reverse attractors.

Twentyeighth Ark: Three Global Doomsday Quantum Timeline Attractors 1. Negative Timeline Attractor 1 - Economic Wars, where most of the money just vanishes from the planet after all the Ponzi scheme banks fall to calls on all their loans. In a matter of days, governments of the world sustains infrastructure collapse, with almost universal world poverty, completely arrested ci vilization, all thrown back to rudimentary technology in an environment being destroyed and hopelessly polluted. Remain ing civilization scavenges resources from existing lands, remaining wood to burn, and in effect, the entire world retreats to the 19th century in an almost helplessly dis eased and depleted environment, with no central services remaining. 2. Negative Timeline Attractor 2 - Terrorist Wars. With Russia, allied with Iraq, China allied with Iran, Russia allied with China, and Syria ge tting involved, there is a distinct probability of a Second Jewish Holocaust scenario happening between the years 2000 to 2012, (2006), where these nations will conspire to literally kill the whole of Jewish populace as the Arab Jihad Final Solution, all in the name of Allah, and with such forces at play, that the west will be patently unable to stop global terrorist wa rs fought in the Middle East and on it's own shores, including nuclear, chemi cal, biological terrorist warfare which will have near terminating impact on the entire world. With Iraq fortified from reprisal by Russia, and Iran fortified by China, and to stop the second wholesale slaughter of Jews on the planet the US will go into it and in doing so, will unleash a terminal 3rd world war. Isreal will use their nukes, Iraq will unleash all they have, all the Arab world will become involved. Second likelihood is China retaking Taiwan. 3. Negative Timeline Attractor 3 - Civil Wars, where America turns into a dangerous survivalist, mugger and mob scene society, with paranoia, the rift between the haves and have nots, social trust, volatile incivility, rebellion of the alie nated, fanatic rugged individualism, everyone selfishly concerned, apathy, self righteous fac tions. What it means to be a good Samaritan, be an American, and American spirit is lost, all leading to civil violence on a national scale, the US becoming a renegade nation that threatens the stability of the world, and UN investigators running around to be peacekeepers in the US. 4. These three above negative attractors are the three primary, entraining, transtime feedback signals in place with greatest momentum for the immediate future for Earth. 5. Terrorist Wars escalate into 3rd World war of nuclear, chemical and biological proportions to make the Earth barren of most life in a few months. Scenario number one: blind hatred under sacred banner, an Arab Genocide alliance, aided by circumstance by Russia and"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"    51 China. This scenario will be initiated by those of blind vision in dishonor of God's true nature, defiling Allah's name, as a holy war. It will be envisioned as a radical Islamic Jihad, effecting an Arab Final Solution on the Jews under banner of punishment for Jewish crimes against Islam. 6. The Arab Final Solution Alliance will have terr ible weapons of mass destruction at the ready. The war will start when the Arab world using threats of mass destruction, declares dominion over Israel and initiates a Jihad to cleanse Jews from the ancient and sacred Arab homeland now called Israel. Jewish nuclear reprisal to Arabs is immediate, and forces of nuclear, chemical, biological wea pons are unleashed by Syria and Iraq, as poisons into all the waters, air and land. Mass death begins. 7. Initially stopping the US involvement is Russia and China, on threat of ICBM target 'redirection' by them in 20 minutes. UN foreign ambassadors label the war a 'regional apocalypse' the US can no longer interfere in, under threat of security council enforcement against the US. Russia and China have a hidden agenda. So the US still has to try to stop the wholesale slaughter, and goes in anyway to help ally Israel. 8. The Final Solution Jihad Alliance, in turn, unleashes biological and chemical suitcase terrorism on US soil. A hail of biowarfare agents, like Ebola, Anthrax, incurable bio-viroids, immune system destroyers, lots of agents are delivered into the air, water and land of the US. The US tries to stop the Arab Reich 'Final Solution' in the Middle East, tries to intervene in the regional genocide actions which can poison the whole world. 9. The US involvement makes it a 3rd world war, ultimately escalating to releasing so many poisonous life killing agents, the destruction of the entire civilized world is at hand. In its own way, this could fit the biblical Revelati ons sequence of opening seals full of horrors, as much as anything. The modern world can erect its own demise. 10. After the poisons and the bombs, there will be rotting flesh, oxygen levels severely reduced, radioactive, chemo-active lethal rain from the sky for decades, all trees and foliage die, massive non-arable, non-livable land, famine, starvation, with no food or clean water. 11. Consequently huge weather change s, massive tornadoes, hot and cold extremes, upheaval to the geosphere water balance, melting of the ice caps bringing as much as a 40 foot average vertical rise in sea level, so that up to 50 foot above sea level today will become uninhabitable, all wetlands destr oyed, most freshwater aquifers destroyed, 100's of millions without homes, much less land in the world 12. Continuing chemical and nuclear killer rains, no butterflies, no bees for pollination, skin cancers worldwide, TB and malaria go worldwide, collapsing governments, no services, everyone left slowly dies. No technology, no institutions, no services, no government, death everywhere, with much of the remaining populace having severe mental health crisis from the immensity of dying going on, the anguish of death, and the barely surviving. 13. In that bleak timeline scenario, within 60 years following initiating events, the Earth dies as a biosphere. It is currently being reflected back to us in present time from trans-time as being the most probable sequence we are heading for, IF we do not change it through material and spiritual action and participation. And for any of us, change it we will."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"    52 Twentyninth Ark: Three Global Success Quantum Timeline Attractors 1.

Positive Timeline Attractor 2: Disarming, defusing, dismantling negative circ umstances. Tracking real world events, being involved, participating, and a pplying both (appropriate physical, social, and spiritual means to change things, such as injustice, inhumanity, suffering, tragedy, pain, and destruction. Our bombs dropped in Iraq can become the unwitting conveyance of releasing delay forces into the environment and jetstream that can permeate the world. Our failure to upgrade the world for Y2K will leave some of worlds infrastructures in disarray, but does not have to stop civilization.

Co-create the \"New World\" by healing the Earth, awakening more connectedness of all life and matter, and appreciation of complexity. 3. Positive Timeline Attractor 3: If we don't live our choice with self respect, then our continuous ambient quantum volitional energy can be siphoned off, entrained into the dominant pattern wafting around us, from a personal to global level. To take charge of our own quantum volitional energies, we must choose and act on the choices, carrying heir r ealization We cannot coast on some past choice or some past action, it requires daily rea lity-making, active, conscious, determined participation and invol vement, seizing the day, everything an opportunity to develop personal authenticity, realness, dignity, presence, consciousness, prescience, focus, empathy, passion, with skill. Develop internal spiritual life, spiritu al tradition, spiritual freedom, spiritual grace, spiritual community.

Co-create the \"New Spirituality\" by healing and forging spirituality, awakening more soul and spirit within us, and beyond us."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"    53 4. All energies have their duality of how hey ar e worked with in a quantum volitional interactive response sense. How we each respond to impact from the world around us defines who we are in energetic terms, and thus, in quantum volitional terms. Apprehension can mean time to pay attention to love or time to fear and control. Confusion can be an chaotic energetic source of ideas or means of disintegration. E xhaustion can mean time to be in a metamorphic peaceful state or time to be asleep. Overwhelm can mean time to find peace and wonder of balance or time to give up. It is not what emotional energies we experience, it is how we work with them, interpret them, in spiritual energetic terms that defines our timeline attractor resonance. 5. The coming suite of various magnitude gl obal discontinuities of non-human, geologic or cosmic sourced energies, which portend immense human eradication, near extinction, are mostly, if not all just covertly comfortable decoys, that distract people from the complex problems of real world human life. Intricacies of real world global threats are replaced with simplistic \"wrathful cataclysm\", a divinely ordained cleansing of the Earth. This gives people a false sense of inevitability and simplicity to the whole matter, thinking God is forcing a cosmic re-boot of humanity. This is violent eradication of most of the populace by one means or another. When the end of the world does NOT happen by some calamitous cosmic event, psychic patterns fueled in the populace continue to need it to happen, with so much identity invested in \"the end of the world\". It never was about welcoming a violent end of the world with open arms. 6. Who ordains society and the vast world populace as needing to be eradicated to make a new world, inflicting mass death in blind vision and devotion to conceptions of divine love and hate, morally righteous judgment, and ready zeal for inflicting punishment? Sorry folks, it's not God or Jesus that is the culprit, but elements of Humanity that recently got the part to play this role over the next decade. 7. This reality vector has already had a numbe r prior singularity splitoffs occur over the last 60 years, with many in the last decade. Already, in spite of ourselves, we have enough going right that we are in the reality timeline vector that doesn't suffer God's wrath, but as surely and as lethally, we can suffer from our own wrath towards one another. 8. Predicted cosmic destructi ons include massive earthquakes, vulcanism, covert or overt ET invasions, polar shifts, photon belts, Revelatio ns-style, Gods' wrath wrought, civilization stopping cataclysms, 2012 calendar endtime zero- point, cometary or asteroid impacts... Given current probabilities, these are all predictions which will NOT happen, and all of which are unwitting, psychological means to keep humanity helpless and disempowered, needed only as spectators. 9. These decoys keep our eyes off the only real ball in the air - humanity's failure of humanity and the living Earth. And help catch the other real ball - in body, in Earth, in Spirit - taking in the coming wave of awakening and accelerated ev olution that the Creator IS helping happen. 10. All unusual cosmic irritants are but as irritant to help the oyster of Earth make more lustrous pearls out of us, maybe even be tter angels of mercy and love. "},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"    54 11. Humanity's failure of humanity and the earth, desperately need to be solved, or the human species will largely self destruct on a planetary wide scale over the first twenty years of the third millennium. 12. The time is NOW to make a difference, every day, both inner and outer, locally and globally, in home and community. It is time for humanity to become at functional united family of humanity, while respecting diversity and soverei gnty of all people, groups and nations. It is time to put caring into action, love into action, spirituality into action. It is time to become more than we have ever been before, as Humans, as the Earth, and as Spirit. 13. Engagement, involvement, making a differen ce and having influence depend on authenticity, honesty, grace, values, staying abreast of the world, having priorities, helping one way or another, with support, information, efforts, prayers, with sincerity, with truly humane values, ethics, competency, informedness, and access to resources. 14. The principal reason for differences in magnitude s, which generate severe mutual conditions, and eventually split into two or three alternate global world singularity bifurcations, is a function of personal human energy assimilation, 15. If sheer human resistance to change, growth, forgiveness, accommodation, is high enough, then what was a quantum reality feedback loop that was quiet, can become louder, find more inelegant means to get messages across. Who is the messenger but none other than the soul. 16. The soul's dreams for growth in a lifetime incarnation may be different than the person's conscious dream for themselves at any given moment. There is friction between heart and mind, and by one's own resistance to new perception, the universe amplifies motivation to the level of fear to get through to us where motivating through love did not get through to us. Thirtieth Ark: Secrets of Holism and Quantum Volition in Nature 1. The secret is, by our collective alchemical influence, we assimilate the cosmic energies of evolutionary acceleration that are incoming. To the degree we do not assimilate, and the acceleration energies are not bei ng integrated into the human energy field, it bounces off, and into the Earth, the elements, mother earth's fuses are overloaded with human rejected cosmic energies that are ricochet tainted tainted by hu man quantum evolutional dysfunction. It results in rebellion of the geosphere elements: 2. Earth: Earthquakes in the world will respond to human existential rigi dity of beliefs and unwillingness to be flexible, resistance to open handedness of va lues and beliefs. 3. Fire: Fire in the world will respond to pe nt-up human negative emotions, such as anger, harbored resentment, depression, rage, f ear, pity, and resistance to open honesty. 4. Water: Water disaster in the world w ill respond to unyielding human prejudice and unexpressed emotion, resistance to feeling, and resistance to open-heartedness. 5. Air: Wind, like tornadoes, will respond to human rigidity of thought, resistance to thinking, blind simplicity of bi-polar thinking, unwillingness to discern, and resistance to open mindedness."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"    55 6. Ether: Large scale cosmic events can amplif y psychic energy. Denial of growth generates parrying from the unconscious, quantum permea tion into alien kingdoms, faerie kingdoms, elemental kingdoms, all responding to the strong human call for growth, responding to the human resistance to sensitive awareness, by starting with harsh awareness first. Thirtyfirst Ark: Humanity Saving Humanity 1. Humanity is at a crossroads of evolutionary choice, the opportunity to become spiritually more than we are, humanly more than we are, and naturally more than we are, and avert worst case global reality vectors, and birth a flourishing human civilization into the first twenty years of the third millennium. 2. Humanity is at a crossroads of evolutionary choice, the opportunity to succumb to becoming largely spiritually impotent, morally bankr upt, globally unbankable, permitting by passive acceptance alone, the escalation of wars into the destruction of humanity by humanity. 3. The last best hope for humankind, is hum ankind working with each other, working to improve the conditions in which we exist, finding within themselves the desire to care about each other. The best of humanity is human kindness, especially when it can be sustained under stress. 4. The positive future is personally realized through spiritual passion, compassion, caring, service, action, involvement, trust, inquiry, awareness, giving, responding, forgiveness, healing, hope, friendship, partnership, apprecia tion of diversity, social inclusion, community belonging, spiritual vision-work, and through various forms of prayer, communicating with, communing with the divine. 5. The time-tested formula of being soulfully l ong and caring, honestly concerned, for everyone as your own extended family, however dysfunctional, can stop self-destructive cycles and vicious circles of evolutionary resistance, that otherwise will generate a negative global future. 6. The realization of inherent human kindness a nd inherent spiritual value of all humans, has always been the hope of an genuine, authentic prophets of God - Jesus of Nazareth, Mohammed, and Buddha, and others. 7. We have already been evolving well enough to be on the optimal side of mass-quantum singularity splits that have occurred a few times in the past. The super majority of humanity is currently carried in the current r eality compared to splits offs in the last 10 years, If we as a whole, in interdimensional evolutionary terms, ca n get 'this' far, after at quite a few split-offs already, why should we not just keep on truckin? 8. As the channeled nonphysical entity Lazaris (through Jach Pursel) says, you create or allow your own reality. 9. As the channeled nonphysical entity Zoosh (through Robert Shapiro) says, many Earth changes of physical consequence have already largely happened, but we did not NOT, as a populace, stay in those alternate 'lower dimens ion' growth progressions, a few did, but not that many."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"    56 10. As a species, at this juncture in our evolu tionary growth, we are doing not too badly with difficult problems. But this is not some kind of passive status quo that will take care of itself. Without substantial personal pa rticipation to change things, to defuse and disarm the negative attractor pattern potentials, wars es calating into 3rd world war. The current 1999 probability of many extreme geospheric or cosmic impacting calamitous Earth-change events in our current global causality vector is (sorry hole diggers) very low, despite all signs to the contrary. 11. There is consideration for allowance and possibility of global Earth singularity splits, where one original Earth timeline splits into two mo re distinctively different timelines, following mutually exclusive global future causality sequences. Regardless of that allowance for global dimensional bifurcation events, in our current global reality singularity set, reside 90% of the conscious focus of souls. 12. With 90% of Earthly humanity together and not lost to other split offs over the last decades, the original soul pool is remaining together. We retain the optimal opportunity to integrate the greatest levels of diversity of human s oul. In the name of love and with love. 13. It is in error for any soul to consider they w ill automatically occupy one future reality vector or another. There can be no presumption of multiple future timeline reality vectors arising out of our one current global singularity. Without understanding th e intimate dynamics of what produces this mass-quantum 'singularity mitosis' phenomenon, no one is in any position to pass judgment on any future possibility, or presume when world causality should or will diverge, and pass judgment on where others stand. This underscores the complexity of the natural world of souls. 14. We must only and ever assume that only one joint future will occur and that no world future timeline splitting can or will happen, despite any earlier statements in this written work. Just because global quantum splitting CAN happen doesn't mean it will, especially when all the human soul energy in the mix is voluntarily sheltered and cushioned by a smaller group of humans on this planet. 15. This global causality umbrella heading on the best case path is operating. The current super- majority of human souls on this planet are being shielded by the minority against negative vector resonance entrainment. Some of humanity has been evidencing the unpredicted capacity for having a full range spiritual powers awakening within themselves, in evolutionary terms. 16. Given the calls of MANY unfortunate human soul s who wish to stay together and not be separated, more able and best case vectored compassionate souls are creating a mutuality umbrella for all souls who are willing. 17. The idea is to not abandon any of the family of mankind, but to assert new physical, emotional, mental, mystical, and spiritual means to resolve many so called intractable problems of longstanding pain and suffering hurt and hatred. 18. There is the preference to keep the whole human soul group together, as much as possible, to evolutionarily upgrade our complex species together."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"    57 19. The prime intention is to find ways to defuse and begin to more gently solve the nature of human conflict and hatreds, suffering, pain and injustice. 20. Whether best case 'innovative' future, medium cas e 'high-stress' future, or worst case 'core- wipe and re-boot' future is afoot, only one will happen for you, not all three. Whatever happens we are all in this boat together. 21. The only rational approach for all spiritual bei ngs is full participating presence in altering and dismantling the circumstances of all aspects of the worst case reality causal vector potentials. In the name of love, and with love. \u0001 Thirtysecond Ark: Effective Qu antum Reality Participation 1. In the world, like the Middle East, emotional separation, prejudice, hurt, hatred, anger, frustration, anxiety, cynicism, and injustice all lead to blind dedication to violent and lethal interpretations of religious ideas, extremely inhumane ultimatums, severe human rights limitations, pathos driven systems of social justice. 2. Unless the hot zones of disunity in the world are cooled, conditions other than the Middle East eruption can be the source of end of the world in the first decade if the third millennium. 3. The human conflict hotspots need to be cool ed in mass-quantum momentum terms, real-time electromagnetic energetic terms, personal and collective emotional terms, and polarized-view terms. They need to be cooled by being diverted and rerouted into more optimal consequence probability paths, in material terms, personal terms, economic terms, human rights terms, cultural dignity terms, religious terms, and environmental terms, 4. Only by physically and spiritually defusing c ontributing factors that lead to human made doomsday for the world, do we each save ourselves and create the best case world non- catastrophic outcome. To each of us, the best case happens only because we personally participate, each in our own way, to make it so the worst case or even the mediocre case outcome does not happen. 5. There is no dimensional slides-and-ladders fame s being played or promoted here, slipping in room for inclusive responsibility copouts ad prejudice. The only game in town is authentic personal caring and the willingness of souls to re spond to pain or to respond to love at all levels. 6. To respond is to learn, to grow and change, whether spontaneously motivating through fear or love, pain or joy, chaos or beauty, factiona lization or cooperative synergy, selfishness or community, crisis or constructive engagement. Change can be labored or graceful. 7. To be conditioned to only respond to pain and fear, only be motivated by pain and fear, or anger and resentment, that 'dis connecting conditioning' spins and steers your soul's focus. It directs your conscious focus to reside in atoms that exist in the reality vector that synchronizes to the pain and fear based growth paradigm. 8. While not as simplistic, current default human causality vectors, by their own current mentally and emotionally dysf unctional character, can easily generate Earthly doomsday."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"    58 This will create immense suffering and pain conditi ons, a fear based survival future reality, a Mad Max post global holocaust world. 9. The number one nexus for averting the most likely negative timeline during the next decade horizon, is to be self-conditioning. Self condi tioning to only respond to love and fun and win- win success co-creation, to be motivated by empathy. 10. This is 're-connective' conditioning that welc omes and respects worldly diversity, works for human dignity, cessation of injustice and imbalance, working towards paths to forgiveness of the unforgivable, and building new backbone s of international human communication, promoting inter-ethnic goodwill. 11. This is the path of appreciation of human commonality and diversity, similarity and uniqueness. This is the path of rediscovery of love of humanity, human compassion, human dignity, civility, good will, building trust, confidence, and esprit-de-corp in humanity at large. These human values, in addition to other for ces of disarming human conflict time bombs, can produce effective transformational currency in regional hotspots of high stress and high- conflict. 12. To mutually co-create the best case quantum future vector outcome, we must attend to all the worst case quantum momentums. To own the most optimal quantum probability, we must be inclusive of the most quantum momentum diversity. This is not a vibrational, caste system. 13. UNLESS we each personally take all our late nt quantum volitional power into our own hands, doomsday by our own human hands, not God's divine hands, is on schedule. 14. If the news is bad, then the key actions are: disarm the circumstances, defuse the triggers, dismantle the patterns, disengage the emotion, avert the sequences, alter the resonance, influence the people, transform the volatility. 15. Some of the key energies are: love, caring, passion, compassion, understanding, forgiveness, healing, generosity, dignity, respect, honest y, discernment, trustworthiness, character, commitment, creativity, presence, visioning, prayer. 16. Some of the key sources of resonance alliance energies are: Divine realms, Earth realms, Human realms. In all these realms, gather intens ity of love, intensity of caring, intensity of intention, and intensity of involvement. Only with implosive love motivated human co- creation, will the explosive hatred motivated co-creation be averted. Thirtythird Ark: The Alpha Omega of Temporal Evolution is Love 1. The Alpha is the Omega, and the Omega is the Alpha returned. The education of love in all things, and of all things, is the directive of th e Alpha, and the fulfillment of love's destiny in all things, is the directive of the Omega. 2. All quantum prescience and resonance is m easured by the amount of the energy of love present in the system. The Alpha-Omega creation loop, is, and shall always be, nothing more than a loop of universal life seeking more love ."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"    59 3. Life is about the growth of souls in evolutio n to become productive agencies of love, agencies of inclusive appreciation of diversity, appreciators of all the beauty, and love invested into all creation, and effective agents of growth. 4. Love is not an effusive undefined mystical energy, it is a focusing, creating, transforming energy of physical consequence. 5. The only important thing really going on right now is humanity trying to grow the human heart, individually and collectively, to r eceive and emit more love. All complications otherwise are a ruse and dance to delay that one promising singularity of human evolution and destiny. 6. Ask and you shall receive. Help is availabl e. Spirit and soul, God and Goddess, an that is sentient, wants to help if they can. 7. Divine agency helps those who help themselves - meaning co-creative creational agencies match existing resonance we are emitting, they do not impose their own, since that wou1d be robbing us of our evolutionary process. 8. The power resides within each one of us. All it takes is authentic hum anity, honest choice and commitment, and active involvement. 9. The world we are in reflects the world within ourselves. 10. We attract the world to us, and we are attracted to the world that best fits our resonance of consciousness. 11. Who we are now is who we are to become. On ly by changing now does the future change. 12. The probable future reflectively creates itself in response to our actual course in the conscious present. Change our present course and the future changes. 13. Prophecy and predictions can be useful alerts to help us avert and avoid major pitfalls in probable future course. But the more we partic ipate, the less the prophecies and predictions are stable or valid any longer. Some proph ecies predict only to around the millennium, since the global history time-course after that was not predictable. 14. All souls will grow, sooner or la ter, one way or another. A ll will make it, so there is no negative judgment on those who go slower or more roundabout. 15. Time goes on, and human evolution will to on, inexorably and beautifully, but only if w~ avert the threats to peace in, the world. In the final analysis, we each, individually and personally make the energetic choice to associ ate with one future vector or another. 16. There are no free rides, despite all the love and compassion in the world. 17. Each soul must individually respond to their own calling."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"   60 Acknowledgements Aboriginal evidence Lederman, Leon Abraham, Ralph Lilly, John Abydos Glyph evidence Maruyama, Magorah Acambaro evidence Maruyalma,McKenlr1a, Terrence Arguelles, Jose Meier, Billy Bashar    Melchizedek,    Drunvalo    Bateson, Gregory Miller, Richard Bearden, Thomas E.
