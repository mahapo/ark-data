FOREWORD This trilogy of e-books on the subject of Native, Indian, Oriental, Aboriginal, Ancient and Christian prophecies may ind eed disturb you... but they will provide you with something no other modern pr ophecy publications has ever done... they will offer you an historical, concrete, time -tested way to avoid the predicted future cataclysms -- through a well documented -- but little known -- holy way of life designed for the common man. The Table of Contents for the Eastern Hemisphere Prophecy Encyclopedia is here , and The Table of Contents for the West ern Hemisphere Prophecy Encyclopedia is here . There is an old Osage prophecy, documented in the field notes of the author of the popular Education of Littl e Tree, Dr. Rennard Strickland. He is a prominent Cherokee/Osage legal educator who resides in Oregon, and recorded a prophecy in his book Tonto’s Revenge, a book intended to encourage young Indians to enter the legal profession so they may right the many wrongs done to Indians over the years. His interpretation of the prophecy is di fferent from mine, but being acquainted with “The Old Ways” of native traditionalism (w hich many Indians on this continent have long spoken of returning to but have been unable to accomplish it) I recognized it immediately fo r what it actually was. The prophecy says, “There was an Osage le gend or prophecy which said that the white man bring something with him that was of great value, but that he would not how to use it and that the Indian would take it and add to it a nd change it and that it would then be good and true and pure. Some say it was Christianity and that when the Indian joined Peyote with this new Christian religion the prophecy was fulfilled in the creation of the Native American Church.” Dr. Strickland thought the “thing” was the statute and case law th e white man brought... but I think I can convince you, if you study what I have provided here, that there is a much more profound meaning to this prophecy."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Hopi were told in their Life Plan, in a rock drawing, of two possible futures once the White Man arrived, depending on how well the Whites were “living their religion.” The Hopi, along with many other Indian Nations and even Pacific Islanders, received similar messages from a divine being(s) telling them to never allow themselves to be converted to the coming White man’s religion, never to sell mother earth, and to always care and share with each other. You will read of these things in some more deta il in then last book of the trilogy EARTH MOTHER CRYING: Encyclopedia of Prophecies of Peoples of the Western Hemisphere. EAST IS EAST AND WEST IS WEST AND NE’ER THE TWAIN SHALL MEET? That old saying by Rudyard Kipling from the 1890s may have been true then, but it just isn’t true anymore... and you will agree after reading the prophecies of the east versus the west. The European, Asian, Middle Eastern and African prophecies in ANCIENT PROPHECY: Encyclopedia of Prophecies of Peoples of the Eastern Hemisphere should astound you with thei r similarities to the prophecies of the Western hemisphere -- far-flung peoples should not h ave known of the religious traditions of others who lived so far away on the other side of the planet. Once you become convinced that calamities might befall the inhabitants of earth soon, a simple reading of ALL THINGS COMMON: the Communal Way of Tribal Life that Jesus Taught will set your mind at ease. Our Creator seems to have a long history of allowing wars, bloodshed, and terrorist acts whenever \"chosen\" people were not living up to the standards the Creator set for them. At least once, Creator has actually drowned all but a few persons on the planet, and the story of the deluge is recorded in the legends of hundreds of indigenous cultures. Creator did this only as a last resort, and on ly after warning his children. 9-11 was predicted by several people including Josyp Terelya, and Mother Theresa on her deathbed. Another attack is predicted by Thomas Gibson, who is a prophet specifically for North America. \"Three Days of Darkness\" is predicted for some time yet future time by many early Christian Visionaries, by Mohammed writ ing in the Qu'ran in the 700s, by the Brahmins in the Kali Yuga, and by the Tibetans in their Kalachakra... and recent discoveries point of this event happening at the end of the Mayan Calendar in December of 2012 when we pass through a \"Dark Rift\" in the Milky Way as our Solar System makes its 26,000 year orbit of the Galactic Center. You will read all the details of these assertions in the next two books of the trilogy. How will the people of world react to this event if no t properly warned ahead of time?

RECENT HEADLINES \"Mossad [Israeli intelligence] reported th at bin Laden bought tactical nuclear weapons from some former Soviet republics,\" he said. \"T hey are not the suitcase- type bombs that people often refer to, but more the warhead-type munitions. These are the payloads of short-range missiles, torpedoes, and th e like.\" He declined to elaborate. Others believe that pilfering military warheads is unfeasible, but that al Qaeda might have bought some of Russia's missing Cold War-era \"suitcase nukes\" on the black market. In 1997, the Red Army's former chief, Gen. Alexander Lebed, acknowledged that 84 such devices were missing from the military's inventory. North Korea recently launched a dummy warh ead which we found in Alaska, so we know that they can hit many of our cities with ease. Read the news, friends, and then say you are not looking for a \"way out\" of this mess.

To the Tribal Elders and other teachers, who kept these teachings alive through all the ages, and to the sacrifices they made in order to pass them on to all of us.

Shirley MacLaine asked Annie to be on her radio talk show and to discuss Mary's Message and Mary's predictions. Anni e asked Mother Mary for the latest predictions. They are: Annie asked: I call upon Mother Mary to please give me some new information and prophesy for our future. I will be speaking on the pred ictions in a little while and would like something to tell people about these next few years beginning with the rest of 2002 and then so forth. What did you mean by saying that 2012 would be a monumental year? Mother Mary answered: My dear daughter, it is with pleasure that I come to you today. For truly you have set your own issues aside. You realize it is th e first time in a very long time, that you asked for this type of in formation. Let us begin. My dear children, Since Annie has asked specifically for this in formation, I will tell you what to expect in the next few years. Let me explain first that these changes, whic h are taking place, do so in the normal pattern of growth of creation. Before, I taug ht you that all things come as the tides do. Have you ever stood with your lower legs and feet in the ocean? If you have, you have felt this normal pattern of growth . It comes forth with a surge and then retreats with equal force. There will appear to be times when more and more is happening on earth as far as weather and nature. But the changes are happening in every area of your world. The changes you call earth changes, are happening to every part of earth and life on earth. So when it appears that nothing is happening in nature, look to the weath er to see the changes, or to economic or governmental or"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"religious changes taking place now. This is all part of the earth and every area, everything that is on, or of th is earth will change drastically. For the next several years, all about you will be wars, regional and at times they will grow to seem to encompass the whole world. But that will not be so. These wars will be different from any war fought previousl y. You have already seen evidence of this in the last year or so. What you call acts of terrorism, are actually acts of war. No longer will all wars be fought with a definite line of demarcation. Many wars will be fought where one or both of the warring parties will not have a real identity, or more like a definite identity. It will seem that small groups of the disenchanted will rise up and commit acts of terrorism just for the sake of creating havoc. So expect to have such acts of aggression create much fe ar and panic. Most often they will strike at times, and in places, and in ways, not thought of before as acts of aggression. This year you will have one huge storm come in off the ocean in your eastern seaboard. It will be one of the largest to come through in known history. In the next two to three years more volcanoes will become active. This activation of volcanoes lets you know that the inner earth is unsettl ed and that the magma is coming close to the surface of earth. These volcanoes are not the ones to fear; it is the activation of the super-volcano that will destroy many parts of the world. There is one becoming active and preparing to explode even as we speak. But the number of volcanoes that will become active will be more than usual. There will be other storms of large size which will hit many parts of the world. There will be a storm to come out of the Indian Ocean and decimate the lands of India and other smaller nations island. In your country this will be a hot wet summer. You will feel as if you have been given a steam bath before the summer is over. Rain will fall in the desert areas. They will have record rainfalls. In other growing areas it will be too much rain which will affect the growing of crops. It m ay be that there will be scarcity in some food groups. It would be wise if the people of this nation would take up the hobby of growing foods, even a few vegetables, and plant more fruit trees. Many areas will suffer mud slides, so as the rain increases during this time there will be an increase in these mud slides and in flooding of unusual portions. In the next few years, whenever a new w ave of increase and intensity of storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes comes, they w ill increase by a large ratio. It will be a definite change and not a slight one. So for a year, or several year s, it may seem that nothing is happening; then out of the blue there will a tornado that has gone beyond anything that has come before, or an earthquake that has gone off the scale. Then there will appear to be a period of normal cy and you will think that was so unusual it will not happen again. Then in a few years another storm, or a large volcano or a larger earthquake will happen again. This is how it will be. In the years 2003 or early 2004, there will be a great earthquake in Mexico which will rock one of the largest cities of the world. In those same years earthquakes will multiply in frequency in all parts of the world. China will be hit hard and many will lose their lives. Earthquakes will happen in Turkey, India, the South Seas, Africa and in Russia. In the years 2005 or so, a large volcano w ill explode in the South Seas, and another will happen in the furthest northern reaches of this country.

At this time it is necessa ry to establish the real existence of cosmic ships known as UFO's. Our awareness of bein gs from other planets is nothing new. Throughout the ages they have visited planet Earth and influenced its development. But modern man, seduced by his pride in the science of three dimensional reality, believes that our Earth is the only planet where life and civilization can exist. The truth is, we have created for ourselves a dark world of confusion and suffering. At this time of transition we need help . Consider the world situation. We have proven that we cannot govern ourselves or ot hers. Our destructive nature is all too apparent. It is a reflection of our limited consciousness. Our brothers, the extraterrestrials, have many millions of years of civilization behind them. They have faculties and powers beyond the edge of our imagination. They have been liberated from the slavery of the ego and have establis hed communities of harmony, love and peace, ruled by wisdom; communiti es we would call \"angelic kingdoms\". In this world each person is his own doct or, his own priest. The physical body is a temple of the spirit of the Creator. It is honored that way and used as a vehicle of illumination and truth. With an illumined and awakened consciousness, these older brothers have freed themselves of the ch ains of envy, weakness, anger, laziness, pride and lust. The extraterrestrials are of the White Brot herhood from other planets. They exist in physical form but they ceased working cl osely with us 500 years ago with the fall of the Incan Empire. At that time a grea t moral and spiritual darkness fell across the people of the Americas. Our wisdom keepers were killed and the new religion of materialism spread across the continent. The priests of science cannot see beyo nd this. They cannot experience the multidimensional world of spirit. The people of Earth, dominated by the dogma of scientific materialism and greed, have pillaged and ravaged the Earth. With the development of weapons, horrible beyond th e imagination, they have brought us to the edge of the Abyss. During this time of great darkness on Earth, contact was lost with the inter-planetary alliance. In South America there are still physical trac es that give testimony to a time when we worked closely with our older brothers from other planets. There are stones with images carved of a man dressed as an astronaut and to his side a UFO known in quetchua as \"ccoyllor ch'asca\" or flying star. In antiquity our ancestors, the Mayans, Aztecs, and Incas received visits fr om other worlds. They welcomed these giant ships which came from other planets in the universe. In the areas of Nazca, Sacsachuaman, MachuPicchu, Pachacamac, Huaytapallana, and Paititi in the heart of the jungle, there were developed 20 glorious solar civilizations. In many of these places were universal airports where a great variety of cosmic ships made of gold, silver and unknown alloys; ships powered by the sun and manned by light brothers. The return of these ships at this time needs to be understood. We are on the eve of a great cosmic transition. They are here to assist us through this transition period. As the pace quicken s during the next few years they will be making themselves known more and more th rough direct contact with individuals, both physically and non-physically. It is their mission to guide us safely through"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"this transition by awakening our consciousnes s. If this is not possible, then they are here to evacuate those few who will be chosen to be the seed of the future generations. These people will be chosen according to the quality of the love radiating from their aura. Our ancestors developed extraordinary psyc hic faculties which allowed them to be in tune with the great mysteries of nature. They did their scientific investigations in a conscious manner; that is to say, they moved in superior dimensions in their explorations. There is evidence of this in the Incan temples in Peru which were created with megalithic stones cut with l unar rays by those with an awakened consciousness who had learned to fo cus and control natural forces. In 1750 the Inca, Shora Atahuaallpa warned the soldiers of the Sun: \"When humanity loses its connection to the natural forces, it will create more war and will become lost in darkness\". Most leaders of political and social movements claim to have peace, happiness and freedom as their goal. But too often th ey look for it in war, aggression, and terror, and by creating hatred and jealousy. This simply doesn't work. We only have to lo ok at history to understand this. We are entering a new era. It is time fo r a new way. We cannot expect society to change until we change ourselves - from within. The darkness of our world; the wars and pollution, is only a reflection of our personal lives of darkness and mental, physical and spiritual pollution. Our true enemy, as well as our true source of strength, lie within. When enough of us have conquered that enemy then the ex ternal world will change. When this happens there will be no need for political parties of the left or right; there will no need for governments because each citizen will know how to govern himself. In the beginning of this fifth solar ge neration there were angels and archangels coming from other planets. They assisted in establishing the new solar era which was created by those that survived the last, fourth, cataclysm in which Atlantis sank into the angry waters of the ocean. That continent with its millions of inhabi tants went into the abyss with all of its advanced technologies. That time humanity was also warned, but they would not listen. Only a few with awakened consciousness were evacuated and returned to Earth after 6 or 7 years to become the seeds of this present era. At that time, after the great cosmic cataclysm, when the Earth wa s still trembling and taking its new form, the enlightened ones were returned to pla ces like Lake Titicaca and other sacred lakes of the Earth to begin the formation of new humanity. From these sacred lakes each couple went a different direction wi th the mission of founding a new solar culture in harmony with nature and the Creator. Now, in the 20th century, many noble people in South America have conquered infinite space, visited other worlds, and have brought knowledge back to benefit humanity.

Those of you w ho have been closely follow ing the spiritual messages (and some o thers) shar ed within the se page s over, especially, the last few months have noticed a common theme: that w e are all, spiritually, in a “decision-makin g” time. There’s no more fence-sitting; ra ther, w e are told that ALL shall experience conditions and circumstances w hich requi re a decision one w ay or t he other—a siding w ith Good or Evil. Well, here w e go again. Yet another respected source has come forth. On Wednesday, January 22, 2003, w e receiv ed a telephone ca ll at The SP ECT RUM from renowned Native American leader Red Elk, w ho felt compelled to sha re th e follow ing message w ith all of our readers. Many of you w ill re me mber Red Elk as Ric k Martin’ s fe atured fron t-page interview ee for our April 2002 issu e. That provocative article w as titled Red Elk’s Medicine Message Of Worlds Within World s: Old My steries, Pow erful Truths For Today. Red Elk teaches and lectures extensively and has several times spo ken to the vast list ening audience of A rt Bell’s la te-night talk-radio program about both spiritu al matte rs an d the many layers of a ctivity going on right under our feet. Rick Martin answ ered Red Elk’s call and, once the in tent w as understood, quickly grabbed his tape record er so that w e could share the fo llo wing information and dialog w ith you. Is it timely? That’s a matter of personal val ue w ithin the Larger Pla y that’s rap idly picking up speed.

Basically, we’ve only got about 2&frac12; years before war comes to our shores, and WE lose. But it won’t be a total loss. The Great Hand of the Creator will slap-down on the foreign armies that occupy the USA. It will slap-down three times, and ev ery foreign personnel who are connected with taking us over will flee. But, nevertheless, war is due. There will be a M7.2 earthquake on the West Coast. Somewhere rolling in from the Portland, Oregon area. Now, I do not know if that’s Portland in cluded, but from that particular area, up toward Washington. Date or year unknown , but it will be early on a beautiful Spring morning. Mount St. Helens will blow again, going through the lava tubes, wiping-out Cougar, Washington—going towards Portland. I don’t know if the winds catch it before or after, and then blow it along the coast, and inland again, East, as before. Time and date and year unknown—but it will be. It will be as before, on a beautiful Spring morning, between 6:00 and 10:30 a.m. More towards Summer, I think, because it’s a very beautiful day. Mt. Rainer will blow approximately just under 1/4 of its top, like an arrow shooting up. And then it will turn around and come down and fill the gap that it had left, creating air pressure far into the inlands of Eastern Washington, Kittitas County. There will be holes from a few mere inches to 60 feet or so across, that are blown out with just air pressure, nothing to do with lava. This will happen sometime approaching or during elk se ason, which is Fall time. Again, the time and year unknown. But we’re in for one heck of a ride. This should take place before the war. Planet X will not flip the Earth. It’s only one of three events. It will be a contributing factor onl y. It is there. We’ve known it in Native medicine knowledge for many, many, man y—well, foretold for centuries. When will it come? I don’t know if it’s on the date everybody is talking about; I have no idea. All I know is that it will be coming. A nd it will cause great disturbances on the Earth. But it will not cause the Earth to flip, though it will be a contributing factor. When will the Earth flip? I don’t know. It will flip within 23 years, anytime within 23 years, and AFTER the events just described. THE LINE IS DRAWN. YOU EITHER GET RIGHT SPIRITUALLY WITH THE CREATOR, SO THAT YOU CAN RELY ON THE CREATO R TO PROTECT YOU AND MAKE YOU SAFE, IF THAT IS WHAT HE WANTS OF YOU, OR NOT. And it’s going to be Bad versus Good, Good versus Bad, Unconditional Love versus Self Gratification. The Christian churches will break up. There will be the true- hearts who will leave, leaving the mod ern-day Christian way, in the church buildings. The true-hearts will start meetin g in homes, again. They will stay in the traditional Christian churches until they ca n’t stand it anymore. But they will be a Light within the Church for a short time, and then they will pull out."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Again: the line is drawn! There’s no more fence-straddling, at all. You make up your mind now which way you’re going to go: Good or Bad. You still LOVE the Bad. They can call you enemy; but you don’t call them enemy. The year 2012 is NOT the end of civilization as we know it; that I can see. But it is the Year of Confusion. So many probables. Mankind can go in so many different, strong ways that the Mayan, the Aztec, etc., just did not see which way they were goi ng to go. They were all such strong possibilities to go. So, they more or less threw their hands up and said: “We don’t know.” Thank you, my brother, that’s the best I can do. * * * Martin: I have one question for you. Red Elk: No, I’m not pregnant. [Laugh ter] Martin: [Laughter] Our upcoming March feature concerns the year 2003, primarily. Red Elk: Yeah, there is something that is going to be done in 2003. I don’t know what. Martin: There is a lot that people are seein g, a lot of apprehension for the first half of 2003. Some people are apprehensive b ecause of Planet X, some people are apprehensive because of the possible war in Iraq, and yet there are other factors coming into play, not the least of which is time manipulation. Do you have a sense of what people’s apprehension is about 2003? Red Elk: Most of the apprehension is caus ed by the Earth, inner great shifting. We are of Earth. We are made of dirt, and stu ff, originally. So we are, therefore, very much in tune with the Earth, regardless if you are aware of it or not. The grading, and all of the movement of our Earth, sh e’s getting ready to roll. It’s causing a sympathetic vibration in the human body. Al so, people are going into parallel times and places, actually doing it—and shocked: “What was that all about?” Because it only lasts a moment, to several minutes. A re they going crazy? No, it’s just they are not aware of what is happening. [Editor’s note: This last comment is very similar to what Al Bielek and Preston Nichols say in Rick’s fr ont-page feature story.] Martin: There’s a lot of that. Red Elk: Yes, there is a tremendous amo unt, and it is growing, and growing, and growing. So some of the apprehension is due to our Mother Earth. And the fact that our people came from her belly—in that se nse, we ARE connected. But most people are not aware of the total connection. But another thing: How do I say it? There is also occurring manipulation through “other forces”—those who in turn are manipulated by Luciferian angels and he himself, who are trying to manipulate the humans to be afraid."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Martin: True. Red Elk: You’re supposed to run to the government; they will “protect” you. You’re damn right they will! They’re part of th e other ones, the Bad ones! You are being controlled simply by fear—they’re tryi ng to, anyway. Big word: fear! FEAR! And those who learn to overcome that fear, and wa lk in the Light of Love and Unity with The Creator—shoot—this will be a piece of ca ke. It will be like walking through a cloud instead of hitting a mountain. It will only cause you to waiver a bit; then off you go, right through that mountain! It’s nothing more than energy in the first place, just as you are energy. You become an unstopable force, going right through an immovable object! It’s al l mind, God-mind stuff. It is, literally, thought energy. You match energy and pass through. And we can do that—but it takes a heart relationship with Daddy to do it. It really does; I’m not kidding anybody. It really does! Put that down, however you want, brother, if you will. Martin: I’ll be glad to. Red Elk: The line is drawn! There’s no ifs, ands, or buts about it. Our skies haven’t turned red, yet. I think that Planet X is goi ng to help along in that way. I’m not sure if it’s going to be a nuclear explosion that causes this. Although, the wavering of our Earth, and this Planet X coming by so close and causing what it does—makes the Earth shake and rattle and roll even more. And since everybody is on edge anyway, somebody might, might hit the wrong butto n and we will have a nuclear war. And I’m talking PRIOR to Armageddon. So, the skies will turn red, day and night, for a number of days in a row. What actually causes it? I’m not sure. It ha sn’t happened yet. We can still change everything if enough people of the planet got right with The Creator; we could stop everything. Planet Earth can go out into space like a slingshot. Mamma would calm down and say: “Ah, the fleas are resting.” A nd not shake us off. Otherwise, we’re on our own. And I tell you true: the line IS drawn! It’s not a matter of going to be, or a little line here, a little line there, like it has been—people here, people there, praying for Mother Earth, not knowing that there’s five more, six blocks down the r oad, doing the same thing. They’re not yet connected, a bunch of little lines. But now, they are going to connect as One! Those who are for Good will connect as One, in some super-huge kind of meeting. And they’ve got to learn that, when they connect, they cannot—I repeat, with big CANNOT—say: “We’re all here for helping Ea rth and mankind, and this is the way you must do it.” They’ve got to realize—I’m talking medicine people, spiritual people, I’m talking wiccan people—I don’t care, as long as they are for Mamma Earth, and for unity of Love, I don’t care how they go to The Creator. But, I’m telling you this: There is a great problem in the world today, amongst the so-called"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"“spiritual” people. They have a problem with : “MY way is right; so we’ll do it this way.” They are not living Mitakuye Oyasin [for all my relations]. They just talk the word. The world is a body, in a sense. We are the doctors, in a sense. All doctors, to be regular doctors, all go to the same kind of basic training to know the body before they branch off to be a brain surgeon, a heart surgeon, a foot doctor. But they all have to take the same basic training before they branch-off. They are forgetting that we all have the same basic training; we ’re all working with the same body. And sure, some know how to do brain surgery; some know how to do foot work. But that does not cure the body; it only cures that part. They must realize it takes all, working together, on the whole body! The brain surgeon, the heart surgeon, the guy who heals broken bones, the guy who takes care of intestinal disorders—without all of them truly working together, no ONE is right. They must unify! Then the body has a great chance of being healed; otherwise, it’s just partially crippled. Right now the body is spastic. We must work together to make the body whole. Work TOGETHER, not against each ot her. None of this “mine is right, yours is wrong” attitude. And until they ca n do that, these who call others together to meet for praying for Mother Earth, a nd all that, but they still stay in their specialty and fight each other—how can they be so stubborn and yet claim to heal all?! They must accept every bit of each other’s little individual—or great—amount of work on the body. The nurse who gives th e aspirin, she is very much needed. And so is the brain surgeon. No one is more important than the other. We must unite! Now, people world-wide are getting awfully antsy, scattered, frightened. As I said, it’s designed to be that way, so they can be controlled. They must be FREE, SELF-THI NKERS, and TOTALLY FEARLESS. And they can’t do that without the total sp iritual contact with our Creator. And that Creator is 100% real! They’ve got to rea ch that point of KNOWING! Make that Creator—however you call The Creator: He, She, Cosmos, Allah, God, whatever— make that one Daddy. Make Him REAL in your heart! Humanize Him to the point where you can run and jump on His lap, a nd hug Him. But do it with great respect; that’s what He wants. You are His though t! You are His child! You wouldn’t exist if He didn’t want you in the first place! So make Him an approachable Daddy. Don ’t keep Him at such a distance, pushed away with some kind of artificial reverence. Talk to Him in a respectful manner. But then, regard Him as you would your father, human father, who you love dearly. You want to go to Dad and give Him a hug. Or, you want to be able to say: “Dad, I don’t understand this or that; help me.” And if you’re in the wrong and don’t admit it, you’re going to get your butt spanked. He’s Dad!

Natoni narrates..."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Since Echa Tah Echa Nah has not been described previously, this opportunity will be taken to introduce him to our readers , so you will understand and know why all Indian people hold him in such great revere nce that they do. He is not a giant of a man; however... he stands at a height of about six feet three inches. His weight is approximately two-hundred-thirty pounds. He has a very beautiful carriage, very straight and erect, moving along with such grace that he seems to glide rather than walk. It would be hard to believe that he has reached the austere age of ninety which he was at the time that we were visiting him. A lionel head rests upon massive shoulders, his hair is abundant and snow wh ite, worn similar to the modern Navajo with a large bob bound with wool yarn at the back of the head. The characteristics of his face show calmness and serenity, and very great kindness yet one can readily know that he has the ability of being very stern, firm, and hard. The eyes are the most commanding feature, changing in co lor from dark blue to black, brown or hazel depending on the depth of emot ion brought about by the subject under discussion. It is at once apparent that he is a man of divine inspiration and wisdom. Paul and I were amazed when we knew hi s vast knowledge of the various ancient languages, his ability to translate fluently and at random any one of the long dead tongues found in the mammoth library. Regar dless of the ancient manuscript from which he was reading, he could transl ate it into the Astecaza language. He also speaks numerous modern languages, conversing with me in all those known to me and others that I did not know. He discussed with us many things pertaining to the Chigaraguan people, th eir mode of living, their la ws, religion and beliefs in the past as well as the present. Great ev ents that had occurred from the beginning up to the present time and far into the di stant future were dwelt upon at length. The longer we stayed, becoming more acquainted with their beliefs and customs, the deeper he delved into the past, even back to the Ancient of Ancients. Our visits to the quiet, mellow library became more freque nt. At these times he would describe the most sacred events that had occurred to the people. His description of Christ's visitation was th e most thrilling of a ll those he related to us. The night before he started to describe th is visit to us, we met in the library and he said at the rising of the sun we woul d meet and go into the Most Sacred Temple for prayer. Just at sunrise the following morning we met at the designated place, having arisen earlier and eaten a hearty b reakfast. We entered into the temple and prayed. After praying we remained in the temple for meditation, and then returned to the library. While Paul and I seated ourselves he brought from a small receptacle a large white doeskin, which he unrolled and spread on the table before him. The tribal historian joined us almost at once, and while he was seating himself, Echa Tah Echa Nah, touching lightly the top corners of the doeskin, looked steadily out of the window with the most wistful expression on his face as though he was waiting for the answer to a silent prayer. By a slight ch ange of expression we could tell that the answer had come, and then he began to read from the doeskin. I will not attempt to pass on to you, word for word; the contents of the manuscript that he read to us, but to the best of my ability will explain all I can remember."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"\"After three days and nights of total darkness, great storms of wind and rain, as well as earthquakes, raged until the four th morning. During this horrible catastrophe the Chigaraguans of that time gathered into the temples, remaining there until the morning of the fourth day, when the sun rose as usual, the earthquakes and storms having subsided. The people left the temples and went about repairing damages done by this disa ster. Just before noontime the people became greatly distressed due to a light in the sky. It was of much greater brilliance than the sun and directing its progress slowly earthward, coming straight to the Chigaraguan city. Again the people gath ered into the temples, many of them prostrating themselves upon the ground, be lieving that after the three days and nights of darkness and destruction, followe d by this unusual light, this was truly the end of their existence. A few people, br aver than the others who were prostrate upon the earth, watched the approach of this light as it came toward them. As it drew nearer they could discern the out line of the body of a heavenly personage. Around this personage, the Chigaraguans believe to this day, a robe made of the quetzal bird feather. The author believes, however, that in confusion they mistook the halo of light around the Christ for what they belie to be a robe around Him. As this I personage touched the earth and wa lked am those prostrate upon the ground, the Echa Tah Echa Nah of that day came forth from the temple to greet him, inviting him into the temple. The wiseme n were assembled and as many people as could into the temple remained there to listen to this great spiritual being. He showed them his pierced hands, feet and wound in his side, telling them of the crucifixion and the resurrection... and how be must visit other people of other places of earth. During his five day visit with the Chigaraguan People he taught them of all the laws and commandments of his Father in Heaven whom they should worship, promising them that if they would live and abide by these laws and commandments, some day he would return and live with them again. He also instructed the wise men to have the la ws and commandments, that he had given unto them, written upon that which would never wear away and be given to the people nearby the Chigaraguans that th ey might follow the same teaching and commandments. On the morning of the sixt h day they assembled in the temple where he reminded them again of his laws and commandments that he had given them. He prayed to his Father in Heaven a nd in the name of the Father blessed all the Chigaraguan people and told them that he could remain with them no longer but had to visit other people of the earth. In a blinding flash of light he ascended into the sky from whence he had come. Immediately after Christ's departure the Echa Tah Echa Nah of that time commanded that the laws and commandments be written upon metal plates and given to the ot her nearby tribes that they could abide by and follow them as He had commanded. From that day to the present the Chigaraguan people have abided by these la w, isolating themselv es from the rest of the world, wanting no contact with the outs ide to deter them from their purpose and their beliefs... always keeping themselves as near perfect as possible, as they expect Him again to visit them at any time.\" \"The other tribes to which the plates w ere given lived and abided by them very faithfully for a space of about three-hundred years. At the height of their"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"civilization, becoming vastly evil forces s oon people, causing wealthy and powerful, the began to grow among the people, causin g them to become drunken with success and falling away from the commandments th at had been given them. Soon there became two factions, the good and the evil. The evil forces created war upon the good. The Chigaraguan people call this the Great War, the beginning of which is not known, but probably between 300 AD and 350 AD. Prior to the height of battle in the Great War many of the people fled to the north east, and south. Those who managed to escape, especially those going south, married into other tribes whose language differed from the former language of the refugees. There is no recording of how long this Great War lasted, which no doubt, continued over a period of a great many years probably a decade or more. At any rate, it lasted long enough for the people to fo rget their native tongue and when they returned to their abandoned cities after th e close of the war none could speak his former tongue. Over a period of time th e survivors created a new language which became universally used among the people. A new key of hieroglyphics, pictographs and petroglyphs was introduced at the sa me time, which now still survives among these people. The old key of languages and writings used prior to the Great War was completely lost, and to this day less than tw enty per cent of these writings have been successfully interpreted. Although many Indian Tribes surro unding the Chigaraguans speak different languages and use various codes in th eir hieroglyphics and writings, the Chigaraguans rave jealously guarded and preserved their original language and writings, using the same now as they did in the beginning of their inhabiting Mexico, which was approximately 480 BC. Inform ation regarding the Great War was obtained from the tribal historian of the Chigaraguan people. The Great War is seldom spoken of by other Indian people as it is only legendary among them, however, the Chigaraguans are the only on es who have a written recording of the momentous event.\" Many of the laws and customs as well as the rituals of the Chigaraguans differ from those of other Indian people. They are deeply sincere in their religious rituals and ceremonies, especially those pertaining to marriage, which all Indian people practice. However the Chigaraguans follow these laws and customs more rigidly, with more sincerity and reverence than any other known group of Indian people. It is their practice to pray six to eight times a day. Upon arising they face the east and give a short prayer of thanks for the night's rest, the privilege of being alive, and in good health. At breakfast-time another prayer of thanksgiving is offered. During the midmorning as people go about their dutie s a prayer is voiced in thankfulness for the condition of their crops, livestock, and other things they possess. A thanksgiving prayer is said at noon-time for the abundance of food that is placed before them. When the evening meal is served some me mber of the family aga in offers thanks. The smallest child may be the one to voice the prayer for th e family. While the groups are assembled around the huge even ing fires someone o ffers prayer for the"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"welfare and happiness of everyone in the group. Upon retiring each individual prays. The custom upon offering prayer is that the individual bows his head, folds his hands and humbly voices the opening of his prayer as follows: \"All mighty Creator of all Earth people and all living things, I speak to You.\" He then lifts his head looking into heaven as though speaking directly to God, extends his hands, palms upward, toward the sky and conti nues with his prayer. Men, women, and children all offer prayer in the same manner. In \"the early hours of the morning the people go about their work, but during the hottest part of the day it is customary fo r them to retire indoors until the heat has subsided, then they complete their chores for that day around sundown. As the lengthening shadows fade into darkness a nd the families begin to group around the evening fires the young men go calling on the girls of their choice to escort them to the gatherings, along with their family. Th ere is no hesitancy or shyness connected with the association of the young men and women. Everyone considers their interest a natural thing and welcomes the opportunity to encourage and cultivate this mutual attraction into courtship and marri age. Marriage at a young or tender age is strictly taboo, and is unheard of. A young ma n or young lady is around twenty-one or twenty-two before serious courtship begins . Courtships usually last from four to seven months at least. When the young coupl e sets the date of their wedding all the people on the reservation know about it. Good wishes and congratulations are sent by runner from one community to the oth er for the couple. On the day designated everyone gathers into the temple to witness this most sacred of all ceremonies. No gifts are brought oil this occasion, but everything has been made ready for the couple to set up housekeeping as soon as the ceremony is completed. As soon as the community in which the young people are to live learns of the date of their' marriage, everyone in the community gets together to make ready the home of the newlyweds. The men and boys build the house, set up fences and get together the working tools, stock, foodstuffs, and all the things the husband will need. The women gather to make the wool into blanke ts, coverlets, and all manner of things for the young wife-to-be to keep house with , storing the cupboards with every kind of food in the community. The various cra fts men contribute whatever is desired to complete the comfort and necessities of th e future. Neither the bride nor the groom has a hand in these preparations what soever. The actual wedding ceremony is solemnized by one of the high council memb ers. These ceremonies are a very sacred event and all things that are done and said are not to be spoken of outside of the people who know of the sacredness of it , therefore the writer refrains from going into minute detail; however, the most beau tiful and significant part of the ceremony is the final vow that the couple takes. In the presence of all those assembled as witnesses, and the council members, the coupl e is escorted by their parents to the baptismal fountain where they are submerged with arms and hands locked, by the three highest council members. This comp letes the temple ceremony. Divorce among these people is unknown, they have never heard of such a thing.

In connection with the first visit of the writer to the Chigaraguan people it was mentioned that there are on known vices, su ch as liquor in any form, tobacco, or any habit forming concoctions that woul d be detrimental to the mind or body. Overindulgence in anything is not known there; their wants and needs are few and simple. As the bonds between this people and Pa ul and I strengthened, the writer was adopted by the leader, Echa Tah Echa Nah. as his son through the blood ritual. It was after this adoption that we were priv ileged to visit the library where Echa Tah Echa Nah read to us of many of the cata strophes that had occurred not only on the western hemisphere but all parts of the world during all ages. He also read to us numerous things that were to come in the future. One of the most astounding predictions that he read to us at this ti me was in regard to World War Two, with the tragedies left in its wake, even up to the present time. Other things he spoke of regarding the future will be mentioned furthe r on in this book. The invasion of the Spaniards was discussed at great length. He told us of the destruction that was wrought upon the mighty Aztec nation at th e height its civilization, which bears out the truth of the story known to the world of how Cortez conquered Mexico. To hear the story coming from the lips of one who had the original records before him was awe inspiring and tremendously interesti ng. The dullness of school day history books flitted momentarily through my mind. Not long after the blood ritual Paul and I progressed in knowledge of the people and their sacred rituals to the degree of being permitted to take part in the most sacred rituals in the Most Sacred Te mple. Of these things I am not free to speak, but they were inspiring and have given me closer cont act with the Source of all living things, which has carried me through many trying and hazardous times even to the present day. Nowhere will the mention or description of any rituals Paul and I took part in other than the form of baptism be related . At this baptism we were submerged, each of us, three times and had bestowed upon us the most sacred of the Chigaraguan blessing. As the expiration of our visa was drawing close, we knew that we would soon have to leave the land of the Chigaraguans. We had become one of them and they had become near and dear to us. It was with pangs of regret that these facts intruded upon our thought, but leave we must. A fe w days prior to our departure Echa Tah Echa Nah, the Mighty Wise One, invite d us to come to the sanctuary and we discussed many things that had taken place during our sojourn there. After extensively reviewing and discussing the laws and rituals of the people, to his satisfaction of the knowledge given to us by him being deeply embedded in our minds and hearts he bade us when we ret urned to our country in these words, \"My"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"sons, you shall seek and find the people whose laws, tradition, and rituals and beliefs, are the same as ours. You shall tell them about us, then they will know of us, and you will send us knowledge of your finding them.\" Following the two nights and two days farewell ceremonial, we again visi ted the temple where all of the high council members bestowed upon us a very to uching and inspiring blessing. At the close of the second day, the moon had rise n and all the people had gathered around the fires. Accompanied by the reeds and tom toms they were singing and chanting as we slowly rode through the gates in company with the mighty Echa Tah Echa Nah, who rode with us a short distance beyond them. Again he reminded us of our mission, speaking very gently and briefly. As the light of the moon fell upon his face, the serenity and nobility of the features w ere beautiful beyond words to express. We were still sitting on our horses when he ra ised his hand in a farewell gesture, and turning from us, rode slowly toward the gates and the warmth of the campfires we had but a few moments ago shared. Paul and I reluctantly wended our way up the gentle incline toward the northwest not daring to look back upon those who had grown so dear to us. As the distance between us and the village grew, the sounds of the tom toms, reeds and voices in song fade d with the light of the fires into the moonlit night, leaving us silent upon the rough mountain trail. We did not stop until the other side of the summit was reached just before dawn, when the horses were fed and watered, and we had breakfast and slept. Five days after our departure from the Ch igaraguan people we arrived in Oraziba, Mexico, from whence we went to Mexico Ci ty where acquaintance with the luxuries of a modern city. Shortly afterward we returned to our home at Chinle, Arizona after visiting a couple of days with friends as we came through El Paso, Texas. Our association with the Chigaraguan people will always be a part of us although we are far removed from them and their beloved leader. At the culmination of several days visit wi th our parents in Chinle, we returned to the East to resume our archaeological work. Many interesting artifacts were unearthed during our field work in the Stat e of Missouri, and are now on display in various museums. During our time off from digging we gave brief lectures of our experiences to specially interested groups, lodges, clubs, and various religious organizations, always seeking out the people we were requested by The Mighty Wise One to find. Digging in Indian Mound soon became boring to us so we decided to give up any further field work, and return we st. Paul visited the old folks at Chinle, and the writer made a hasty trip to Brune au Desert, which borders southern Idaho with Nevada. After brief research work there, an invitation to come into northern Idaho and investigate some Indian ruin sites located there brought to light interesting and valuable artifacts which w ere disposed of. Lectures were carried on here the same as in Missouri. While in the western states the people whom my father bade me seek were found and be was notifi ed of their whereabouts. Each knows of the existence of the other. My mission had been fulfilled. Not long after finding the people who my father had urged me to locate, I had word from him that at the beginning of their I ndian new year he would call a meeting of"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"the representatives of all the Indian tribes of all the western hemisphere. It would be held at Lake Patzcuaro, Michoacan, Mexico over which he would preside. I gathered from the informatio n that he had sent runners, bearing a message in regard to the great meet, to other Indian tribes. Each runner being instructed to notify the chief of the tribe he visited, for this chief to send runners to other tribes nearby with the same message to be relayed to other tribes as far as a bird far as a bird could fly to the south and as far as a bird far as a bird could fly to the north. The following April was when the great ma ss of Indian people gathered at Lake Patzcuaro for this conference of good will. The opening speech on the day of the gathering is given here in Echa Tah Echa Nah's own words: \"Oh, my brothers, today begins the year for the past is gone and everywhere new life begins. The Great Spirit, th e Creator of all living thin gs - plants, flowers, birds, trees, reptiles and fish - speaks to me what He speaks to me so shall I say you. As he bade me call you here and as He whispers in my ear I will say His name all these words I speak to you. My people, today we are here together. Many have come from all places as far the birds fly north and as far as the birds fly south. Many of you, my brothers, are tired and we ary. Many of you are sick and ailing, but to you, my people, what I say will ease your tired minds, and help to heal your sick bodies. I have called you here to gi ve you a great message of patience, understanding, tolerance, good thoughts and l ove to all. Today we are happy, or are we? Are our minds and hearts heavy with the misunderstandings of the long dead past? Think wisely as I say to you, 'Have you tried to get help and peace of mind from Him who created us?' No... for you have fallen away from your prayers, rituals, ceremonials and dances, for th e Gods see everywhere. Should He who created us silently send Nasi Bii Yaksy, the Death God, to speak and silently tell you to come, are you ready to return to where you first were, or do you fear? I say unto you, my brothers, fear not for what must be, for He has sent us here to this world so will He call us back. We must stay near to Him our hearts and minds now more than ever before for He has spoken unto me saying, 'Great things in the future time are soon to be upon you. Alrea dy He has started to act upon the plans He promised in the beginning. We must ma ke ourselves ready and good enough to accept all things. We must cea se the killings of our brot h amongst us. We must keep hatred and evilness from our hearts and mi nds. We must be patient and respond to the things we ask of each other. We mu st be patient and try to understand, but above all, the needs of each other no matt er how small or how large, we must have love in our hearts. We all have love in our hearts, but we must make it greater, stronger, a more beautiful. Where there has been hatred and evil now must there be patience and understanding, all bad things must pass from us. To Chi Chi Suma on my left, and my son on my right, I say to them as I say to you. They shall listen and do as you shall do. I ask all of you to hear well as I speak of how my people, the Chigaraguans, do in regard to all ways of living. You are asked to take my message back to your people and ask of them to try hard to do as my"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"people do and have done always. I know of your trials and suffering, of what you have seen in the past, but by your g reater efforts to live by the laws and commandments that He has given you to live by, you will all know greater happiness. By greater happiness you will have greater understanding and tolerance and by your faithfully keeping these laws and commandments in your hearts minds there can be no limit to the future for you and your sons and their sons. Pray faithfully and you shall soon see reward it pays. Think well, all my people and forget not soon, May His everlasting smile enter into your hearts, and may light from His golden body (the sun) the light to keep th e flame in your hearts burning, for as He has spoken to me have I sp oken to you. Remember, my brothers and sisters, always what you were once, what you Might have been, what you now. And what you intend to be. May light shine on us throug h all time through a ll ages. May He hear and answer our prayers. Always remember this, people, I beg you to remember. I have spoken; it is finished. The Voice speaks no more.\" Those assembled remained here for seven d ays, during which time he described to them the mode of living of the Chigaraguan people, urging them to try to live and follow the same example to create better understanding and good will among their' neighboring, tribes regardless of what part of the country they lived in. He brought to mind many incidents which had caused the downfall of the Indian people -their drifting away from the laws and commandm ents, their warlike ways instead of peaceful means of dealing with each other. Owing to the tremendous response to his call he had to speak several times a day to as many as could assemble in the great amph itheatre, urging them to be tolerant of each other. more understanding and to quit their slovenly ways and be more progressive resort to prayer and a better understanding with the Heavenly Father to assist them in their efforts. Newspa per reports estimate approximately one- hundred-twenty-five-thousand representatives a ssembled from all parts north of the Mexican border as far as Alaska and Canada . It is impossible to say exactly how many were there, but about two-hundred fi fty-thousand would be a fair estimate. At the close of this international conferen ce he invited all representatives who were present to return again the following ye ar to discuss their problems and the progress made under the outline he had given them. On the last night the huge fires of farewell were lighted, and soon the representatives were on their way back to the reservation they had represented, to inform the people of what they had learned at this great meeting. Immediately after th e representatives had returned home there was a noticeable difference in the rel ationship among the tribes. A better understanding and a feeling of good will existed that had never been there before. By the time of the second meeting in Mexico all the tribes had outstanding progress to report. This uniting of the Indian pe ople has been gradually getting stronger since that time. In due course of time the tribes made preparations to send their tribal spokesman again to the site where the first notable meet ing was held, to discuss their problems"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"and report the progress that had bean made during the year. At the same time Echa Tah Echa Nah and his council members were making preparations to leave their Utopia to bring the message of good will agai n to those who were to return to Lake Patzcuaro. Incidentally, Lake Michoacan within sight of Lake Patzcuaro and together they are often referred to as \"The Twin Lakes On the day set aside by all Indian people as the birth on the new ye ar, Echo Echa Nah and his council arrived at designated spot and by all representat ives from the outside. Each group was eager to discuss the progress that had been made. After four days hearing reports from the various spokesmen Echa Tah Echa Nah stressed the importance of continuing as they had in the past year. He also told them of great events that were to take place in the future. He prophesied in minute detail the coming of World War II; the havoc, destruction and hardships that would be brought upon the people were mentioned. The people were urged to fill their storehou ses in preparation against the time when this war would come, and told them of the shortage of food and other materials that they would be forced to suffer. Many of the people harkened to his prophetic warning and were prepared when this catastrophe came, which lessened their hardships during this trying period. He st ressed the restlessness of the world after the war would come and the hatred, scorn and contempt of man for his fellow man that would be universal. The Indian people he urged to remember his teachings and not be led astray by the disunity that would engulf the world about them, admonishing them to cling together in understanding and purpose a good force in a world of evil. On fifth day the representatives of many of leading tribes expressed their feeling discussed among themselves th e possibility getting Echa Tah Echa Nah to accept position of Grand Leader of all Indian people the western hemisphere. Due to his knowledge and divine inspiration they felt he would be the ideal leader of the people. Word spread rapidly among all the outside representatives and by mutual consent I bestowed upon him this honor. The throng that had gathered at great meet was one of the oddest groups one would ever have the pleasure of seeing assembled at one time. Of this greatest assembly ever to be recorded the most striking feat ure was the display of tremendous variety in their dress, variety in material, designs, colors and manner of wearing. Representatives of every Indian Tribe in the western hemisphere were dressed in their finest regalia. Canadian and Alaskan Indians in their peculiar cold country costumes made of seal, bear and rabbit fu r that would serve best in a cold county were seated next to tribal representative s from the Dakotas who were wearing their finest white or tan buckskin raiment with huge eagle feather bonnets. Next to these two were seated three or four tribesmen fr om the Brazilian jungle dressed only in breech cloths and moccasins, each carrying th e staff of authority and tribal emblem bearing his rank in the tribe and conducti ng themselves with dignity humbleness in regard to their tribal standing. Sprinkled here and there appeared South, In dians clad in their lush velveteens of hues, silver belts, strings of turquoise beads and hand-wrought bracelets and rings"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"of silver and turquoise. Of this group the Navajo and Hopi were sent as representatives. Seminoles from the Florid a everglades in their brilliantly colored skirts and headdresses were scattered among Indian representatives from California who were dressed in the finest of modern American clothes. The Mexican Indian with his large straw hat, serape draped arc his shoulders, brilliantly hued raffia sandals was seated next to the Oyic hua with peculiar hat made of willow twigs tightly woven, similar to the early America n's beaver hat or the stovepipe hat, white cotton trousers and sandals. Standing nearby some of the North Am erican representatives who were dressed in their modern up-to-the minute fashionable clothes, were the small Suyas and the Javaros dressed only in breech cloths, and a small animal skin draped around their shoulders, armed with their tiny blow guns. Close by were the large Ladones from Columbia and Venezuela whose dress was similar to that of the Roman toga made from brilliantly hued cotton and wool mate rials. The wool comes from the vicuña. While many others from Columbia dresse d very similar to those of Venezuela, seated near the Incas from Peru with thei r short, robe-like garments with trousers made from the wool of the llama and hats v ery high and pointed almost like those of the Coushea. All in all, this was one of th e most colorful assemblies of the true natives of the western hemisphere a nd certain one never to be forgotten. On the sixth day of the meeting the beloved leader delivered his most divine inspired speech to the people. During this speech many of them looked upon him with awe, as he described the greatest of all events that would come upon the Indian people in the future. He prophesied of the time to co me when a great temple or kiva would be built at some distant place I the Indian people and others who belie in all the laws and commandments that I left with them in the beginning, but not until after the cleansing of the earth. The cleansin g process was described as a mammoth catastrophe that would engulf the earth, ri dding it of all evil forces and only those who believed in and abided by these laws would survive. Then after the earth would cease to shake and the storms subside, the survivors would go forth and bury the dead, also care for the sick and wounded. After the dead will have been buried and the injured healed and all is quiet and pe aceful again be, Echa Tah Echa Nah, will call all the survivors of the great holoca ust who lived in his country, and prepare them for the great trek from their world. At this time he would send runners to Chi Chi Suma, who is second in command, bidding him to call the survivors in his part of the country to prepare themselves for a great journey that they would embark upon for they were to leave their country for ever. Many months before starting, preparations will proceed by all the people getting together to raise all the foodstuffs that will be necessary, also all other thin that the people will need for their survival. The pottery workers will immediately prepare containers of adequate size and shape to transport the grains and foodstuffs. The basket makers will do likewise; leather workers will prepare all articles necessary to be used during this great trek; weavers will make blankets, robes and all other articles need until the people could again be settled in their homes. All this is in the"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"future and the people are waiting for the time to come when they will abide by what he has instructed them to do. During this peri od of waiting the people are not idle for they have hand hewn and polished all the stone blocks to be used in the Great Temple, and hand polished the white mountain mahogany wood that will be used to beautify the interior of this most sacred, edif ice. Each stone is cut so that it will be interlocked with the stone adjoining it. No nails will be used in the building of this unique structure. All woodwork will be fitt ed together with wooden pegs or pins, Only the most precious metals will be used for decorative purposes; however, these will have no face value during this period for there will be no medium of exchange. Semi-precious stones such as jasper, turquoise, sardonyx, lapis lazuli, and amethyst will be used to add splendor to the interior of this Holy Temple. As previously mentioned, after the di saster two great forces will leave the Chigaraguan Country forever to begin their se arch the site where this temple is to be erect Following divine guidance and inspirat ion, this place will not be difficult to locate. There they will make preparations and be work on the Holy Temple and the city within a wall. Echa Tah Echa Nah, havi ng previously notified the people to prep themselves fox this long trek, will call counc il members together to tell them that the time has now come for them to begin the task of final prepar ation for embark upon this journey. At the close of council meet ing the council members go, each to his own community, and personally supervise the final preparations seeing that all is in readiness for this move. A great bustling about will begin as the people round up the live stock, pack grain and foodstuffs, and other useful things for their departure from the land of the Chigaraguans. One of the last acts of preparation will be the tremendous task, th e responsibility of which has been placed upon one of the co uncil members, of moving the stones for this great temple. These stones are already prepared and carefully stored in the quarries from which they have been cut, and will have to be moved with caution due to their overwhelming weight and to prot ect the finish given them. By crude means of transportation these massive blocks will be moved to the shore line, where huge barges will have been constructed to carry them to their destination. After all the stones and hand-polished wood will have been loaded on the barges and all is in readiness, the council member in charge will not depart until word comes from Echa Tah Echa Nah. When the runner brings word back that Echa Tah Echa Nah's group has started the trek from the agreed point of Lake Patzcuaro to journey north, the council member will give the command for the barges to shove off and slowly drift with the current near the coast line following it to the north Thus will start the first group led by Echa Tah Echa Nah. It will have been previously arranged between Echa Tah Echa Nah and Chi Chi Suma that at the same time Echa Tah Echa Nah was preparing to move to the north, Chi Chi Suma was doing likewise. Five days after Echa Tah Echa Nah’s group will have left Lake Patzcuaro, Chi Chi Suma's group will have leave Lake Patzcuaro, Chi Chi Suma's group will leave from the same point on their journey northward. The exact preparations for departure that will have been made by Echa"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Tah Echa Nah will be made also by Ch i Chi Suma. The same technique will be followed in moving -all their earthly po ssessions as well as constructing barges, loading and transporting the stones from the quarries located in Chi Chi Suma's country (which is a great deal farther so uth than Echa Tah Echa Nah's country). Prior to the departure of this second group, word will have b een sent to all the Indian tribes extending into South America that the people should make preparations and gradually move to the no rth to inhabit the abandoned places left by the people of Chi Chi Suma and Echa Tah Echa Nah. As the South American Indians inhabit the va cated cities they will be instructed to remain at these places until after the Holy Temple and the city within the wall has been built. As Echa Tah Echa Nah's group leisurely winds its way north, Chi Chi Suma's group will be following the same route at the same pace. Each group will have a forward vanguard followed by the livestock, pack horses, and carts, the women and children traveling next to the rear guard. Their mode of transportation will not be as it is in these modern time s, for the destruction will have done away with all forms of modernization, leaving only the most primitive. Constant contact between Echa Tah Echa Nah's group on land and those taking the water route north will be kept by runners. Should the barg es, in any respect, come into difficulty the land forces will immediately dispatch assistance to them. After traveling for many days to the nort h, the advance scouts of Echa Tah Echa Nah will report to him that they have fo und the body of water that flows from the west to the east, or east to the west, wh ich will be the first goal of Echa Tah Echa Nah's group. Immediately after crossing this body of water, preparations will be made for the people to remain there unt il the arrival of Chi Chi Suma and his group. The barges will be instructed to an chor in the bay - until the arrival of the other barges under Chi Chi Suma Following slowly and laboriously the same route taken by Echa Tah Echa Nah, be should arri ve at the river five days after Echa Tah Echa Nah. Chi Chi Suma's advance scouts will report, after many days of travel to the north, that they have sighted the first group en camped north of the body of water which flows from the west to the east Soon the tw o great forces will be united at this river, and Echa Tah Echa Nah with his council members will hold conference with Chi Chi Suma and his council members, and th ere will be great rejoicing among the people. Both groups, after a short period of resting, will prepare to move on from this point. Runners will have been sent to take word to the barges to make ready to start.

Echa Tah Echa Nah with his group will start trekking to the west. His advance scouts will be continuously searching for a low range of mountains running from the north to the south.

We know that the time has come - abou t a year ago - that the time has come to stand up for our rights. So that's what's ha ppening everywhere. It'll be the same in North America, South America, Central America and Mexico. It'll be the same all over. Many things are being done. We know it's not only with the Indian pe ople at this time; that the same forces working for our destruction are working fo r the destruction of other people and their way of life also. But we know too that the first start of a resistance and the first comeback of the Great Spirit's way of life will be made with the native people here, and it will extend to other people. Like a diagram on a board, a chain of friendship of human hands. It'll eventually extend around the world. TZ: What are the signs now that this is happening? RT: It's happening among the native people already. It happened at Henrietta, Oklahoma this last June. Sixty five tribes and medicine men from the United States, Canada and Mexico met, and we joined hands at the end of the ceremony, and smoked the peace pipe, and this was the firs t time in one hundred years that all the tribes came together on a high And next ye ar, or some time in the near future other I will be invited to join, and then the chai n of friendship will be extended around the world.

The tribes of this part around Los Angeles, the small bands Indians that inhabited this area consider themselves Shoshone althou gh they speak a dialect of Shoshone. Shoshone is the mother tribe, a very ancient people. Indians of all the Southwest, and this part of the country was all at one time part Ute Aztec Empire. TZ: What happened to that empire?

And we know what happen ed when they came here. People violated all five of these laws, and that's why our people had to be corrected. Now our period of test and trial is over, and predicted that those who were true would survive, and who were not true would be destroyed. But that also applies to White people as well as Indians. It was pred icted that in the last days many Indians would turn back to the Great Spirit's way of life, and that many White people would also turn to the Great Spirit's way of life. It's not a racial thing. TZ: What were the five laws? RT: Those five laws at that time given us: One was that we were not to join any foreign religions. So we know what happe ned when Columbus came, and the priests and their robes, and the cross, and the Indians bowed down. And the Great Spirit was angry - even at that time because our people were living in a garden of Eden, and had everything for the taking and yet they chose to bow down before a foreign power and to foreign gods. Another law was that we were not to sell our lands. They would bring something that glitters to trade with. Money. And they would buy our lands. We were not to sell our lands because the earth is our mother and it is not for sale. One is that they'd bring something to drink that looked like water but it would taste like fire, and it would make us foolish a nd weak, make us do things that we'd be ashamed of later. So we were not to take this. And another was that we were not to mix the blood until after the day of purification at which time differences would cease to exist, and all people could live as brothers, where there would be no more lying, no more stealing, no more breaking of treaties. At that time we could intermarry and all live together as brothers. And another - we were not to give our name to any paper or agreement. They would try to get us to put our name to a paper, to make an agreement . In other words, a treaty. And we were not to do that, we w ere not to give our name to any paper or agreement because we would keep our word and they would not keep theirs. They would talk out of both sides of their mouth, and break their word. So all those things have a ll been violated, and some of our people did not remain true and have been punished very severely.

If the count ry and many are to be saved from the gourd of ashes of the atomic bomb we must start making this change now - in the direction all people who have a good heart and want to live in and happiness will have some way to follow where they correct th e things that are being done so that we continue to live here without wars a nd aggression, the breaking of treaties and the stealing of lands. Those kind of things. TZ: When you talked about the Garden of Eden -- before the coming of the White man, I wondered how this way differed from civilization of the Aztecs which was much more specialized and organized. RT: There were no differences. I have Inca friends up here, we have our people down there, and there is more contact betw een us than the White man thinks. In ancient times, the Inca civilization pr ovided for all its people. There were store houses built along the highways. If anyone was I they could take out a certain amount of food or grain without asking anyo ne. They only took for their needs, they never thought of profit or exploitation , so there was no need to guard these storehouses. They were very well organized into squads of 10. man over a squad of 10 had to look after his group, then it went to 100. They said that no man could take care of more than 100 people so from there it went to the head Inca. They still have their organization intact, and they have their and colleges, but they are well hidden. TZ: What do you believe is the relationsh ip between belief and those of the Tibetan Llamas? RT: I think it is very similar. In the trad itional way we can't s ay that this is more communion because that be incorrect. I recei ve letters from Druids over in England, descendants of the people who built Stonehenge, similar things to what we have here, and I find that many of their teachings are basically the same as ours. Our religion is a nature religion, a religion of nature, and that wo uld indicate to us that the Great Spirit is in all things, all thin gs that have life, that all life is to be respected, and all forms of life should be respected including human life, animal life, plant life - and the entire li fe force. If people were to adhere to that and eliminate the greed which exists in the world today, there'd be no need for wars and aggression. And that would be true of any pe ople living in their primitive or original state. I'm speaking of the time befo re the Roman armies and the Christians conquered Europe. People living in the primit ive or original state believed much the same thing as the American Indian no matte r what part of the world they were in."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"TZ: They find examples of the same kind of structures in Egypt and South America and in Stonehenge - all based upon a science which is on a completely different level than what we are operating under now...

But they were thinking in terms of science to save man, science for the good of the human being. Today when we look around us it seems as though scientific advancement is based on how to destroy, the destruction of ma n, or on a lower level, for profit motivation... destruction of the land also. The pollution of the rivers, air, the land and the timber, everything, everything they touch. We Indians have a different way of thinking. We think in terms of respect for nature. We take a plant out of the ground for medicine, we have to make a prayer, and make an offering - beads, tobacco or other different things - then we smooth the dirt back to the original way it was. I ju st tell that to demonstrate that we don't contest nature, we live in accord with natu re. That's the way we were told to live accord with nature. TZ: Our science tells us th at we must conquer nature. RT: I understand now that there is a commissi on in Washington which is trying to find out why they are having eight ti mes more earthquakes and cyclones and tornadoes in the midwest than they ever had before. They've had that for several years and they haven't decided yet because I've been trying to I up with that, and I notice recently that they had an ea quake in Chicago and in some other places back where never had them before and I can predic t right now, I know we are going to have many more of those all through co untry where the Indians are no more, where there are no no Indians who know the law of and life of this continent. They are going to have many more of them because each area there's at least one Indian who knows those law nature, but back there I have seen where there are some a where there are no Indians left at all -- no even made -- Indians, much less traditionals. So they're going to suffer g reatly in those areas more and more as they keep pressing the native people.

One thing that should be remembered - the Indians set no date - also - is because prophecy is subject to change, and, also, there are a great good forces at work at this time in California.

And they are going to make one last great effort to hold on to their ill-gotten gains . They think they have something to lose even by giving people their human rights. They are so greedy, they are afraid they'll have to give up something when they have everything to gain. That's because of their wrong training. TZ: One way or the other... the day is near at hand.

It wouldn't surprise me at all to see the day come, just like it came in our country in Ruby Valley, when these people who've been beatin' people over th e head - who arrest people on any kind of charge, and ignoring the real crimes: when these people are rounded up and headed for the Pacific Ocean and let them see if they can swim. I don't want that construed as a threat. I don't want it misinterpreted. But it is something I see coming in the future. I'm not saying who will do it, or how.

We had no law, we had no protection from the law, and so it just happened that I'm not s aying that's the way it'll happen in Los Angeles TZ: What did happen in Ruby Valley, and what we events leading up to that? RT: The events leading up to it were in the first place arrest of one Indian named Stanley Smart who wentkill a deer for f ood for his family. He went off the reservation to kill it. Most of the hunting is off the reservation. The reservations are small and barren. He'd been laid off his job in the qui ck-silver mines because he got Mercury poisoning. They laid him off his job, I no f ood at home. He had no milk for the baby. He ha children, and it's almost impossible for an Indian to get welfare in the state of Nevada, so he did the thing that was natural for him. He went on this land that used to be an Indian reservation - which somebo dy - they don't know how, some of the puppets or agents sold it or disposed of it - but their ancient hunting ground anyway. So he went the: killed a deer. In the meantime all these towns up there, the whole town of Winnemucca, Elko - are fi lled with sportsmen. The rich White hunters with their jeeps and their high powered rifles with telescopic sights. They's drinkin' their whiskey gettin' ready for the opening of the deer season. So Stanley Smart was promptly arrested, and th rown in jail, in spit e of the fact that he was sick. And his wife nine child ren were left stranded in the town of Winnemucca And we had quite a time getting any help for him at all. Then we got a report a day or two later th at the sportsmen, so-called headhunters, deer hunters, were out reservation hunting. So we sent out a party of scouts Oscar Johnny to keep an eye on them. And they watched them for two days with field glasses and reported back they were camped all over the reservations and that the, shooting up the game, leaving some of it out in the hot sun to rot, drinking their whiskey and headin' back up for bigger ones. And that the Indians had barricaded themselves in their houses afraid to st ep outside because they were shooting at everything that moved. So the third morning Chief Tumok, the Chie f of our tribe who don't speak too good English, but just enough to get by, he went to one party who were acting quite aggressively, and told them they were on an Indian Reservation and they were not supposed to be hunting there. And they laughed at him. They told him, \"Aw come on Chiefy, it's all right, have a drink, we're not hurting anything\" and stuff like that. Of course the Chief don't drin k, but I ask him, \"What did you say?\" \"I didn't say anything, I was afraid they'd shoot me.\" So we had them surrounded and came in on them one minute after sundown. All five camps. War paint, feathers, we ha d no bows and arrows. We had automatic"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"rifles and automatic shotguns, and pistol s. We just came up around them, we were around them and among them before they knew we were there. They froze like statues, they stood there. The fact is they couldn't talk. Four of us went in to talk to them. The others stayed back a little ways with their guns in the air so they wouldn't shoot anyb ody accidently, and four of us, including myself, went up to talk to them. The first one I picked out because I thought he was the leader of the group because he was acti ng the wildest and the toughest before, you could hear him for miles, but now he was quiet as a pi n. And I walked up to this one guy and I said, \"You are hunting on an Indian Reservation.\" He looked at me. His mouth was workin' but there was no sound. So I repeated it again a little louder. And still the same thing, no sound. And then another one, he was mumblin' to himself, and he was talkin', so I got up close to him to hear what he was seven', and he was praying \"Oh, Jesus save me, I didn't mean any harm,\" 'and like that... Only one of them could find hi s tongue. Well, he started to put his hand in his pocket and I stepped back while a couple of young bucks began to draw down on him. I told him, \"Don't move, don't move buddy.\" And he stopped, and says, \"I just to show you my credentials, that I'm alright. I'm a Sheriff.\" I said \"Okay, but stand sideways to me, do n't face me and move very slowly, very slowly.\" So he did, and he a badge and a card out of his pocket and between two fingers he handed it over to me, but I woul dn't touch it. I looked it but I wouldn't touch it. And sure enough he was a sheriff . I told him we were trying to get the sheriff the morning, and I wasn't in a good mood, I wasn't thinkin' things about sheriffs at that time. I told him that's no here mister, that's no good at all. So he wanted to know what the boundary of the reservation is. I told him, \"I'm not going to tell you. Just one way, the w ay you're leaving, and you're leaving very quickly. I says, \"you got fifteen minutes. Now move!\" They got their legs going. They moved. And then the other groups coming down from the hills. They all joined together on the way out. Now we went to check the reservations again, nine big reservations, and they were all clean. We rode up an( the South Fork, and different ones trying to find fishermen hunters but there were none. Word had gotten out that in the bars I think, and it hit the headlines of the papers and they took out. So all we could find was the Indian camps where the White hunters had been - making jerkey, and puttin' thei r winter supply of meat. So I guess they told it in the bars that night. That's what I heard in Elko - about the Indians coming down on them in war paint and everything, and made us out to be a lot worse than we are, when actually it our ground, defendin' our homes and lives and property. And it wasn't a raid. Actually it was a confro ntation, if you want to call it that. We were purely on the defensive. If we ha d been raiding a White man's ranch or"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"somethiing like that, it would have been different. It would have been a raid. But they were the ones raidin' our property, and we put them off. TZ: Even by White man's law... RT: Even by their own law. That's the way it 'll have to be. Just like a burglar would come into their house - he would be the raider, not the man defending his house. TZ: How did most of the press treat this so-called \"raid\"? RT: Most of it was favorable. Only one paper that has a history of not takin' Indians: the Reno Evening Gazette. They're the only ones that came out and said that we were still fighting the Civi l War and other uncomplimentary remarks. TZ: Rolling Thunder, could you give a brie f history of the pinenut tax in Nevada? RT: Pinenut tree's don't get much bigger than orchard trees. They're really small trees, and they have very rich nuts that grow on them. They make up a large part of the Indian's diet in Nevada - together with the deer meat. The Indians go and camp out for weeks at a time, and gather these pinenuts. They use some for the winter's food supply. They cook it in many different ways, and they eat it raw, and some of them they sell to get money for things they need because there isn't much work for Indians up there, a nd they can get a little money that way, and they get them by the pick-up load. Now the state of Nevada and the Bureau of Land Management together they put a tax on it. I guess it must have been two or three years ago. The people are supposed to pay five cents a pound for everything over 25 pounds. Then they're supposed to get another permit, cost five dollars, if th ey sell any of them, and then pay another tax also of a percentage of the pinenuts they sell. So it would amount to quite a bit. And they'd taken this from people who h ave the lowest income. The Indians don't even have half the income of the colored people. That's how low on the scale the Indians are. And the Indians says, too, that the state di d not plant those trees, the Great Spirit put those trees here. And yet the Bureau of Land Management - and we had taken pictures and know of about seven or ei ght different areas of Nevada -- where they put two caterpillar tractors side by si de about fifty yards apart and put a heavy chain between them and tore these trees down - over thousands of acres in order to grow grass for the sheep. And they sell hundr eds of thousands of little pinenut trees for Christmas, and we protested that. take s 31/2 years for a pinenut tree to reach maturity.) Yet say they're using this money that they get from the tax 1 serve the pinenuts. And we know that's not true."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"We're trying to make up a little book to illu strate public that it is not that way, that they destroy the trees, not conserve them. Th ere is no reason for this tax at all. And not paying this tax, none of our people are paying that tax. We're all supposed to have a permit to build a fire. The camp out, and they gather firewood. Now the Indians never start a forest fire or a rang e fire because they a careful about those things. And yet they're supposed a permit to gather firewood. Everything we do, we're supposed to have a permit. The Indians know that those things were put there by the Great Spirit, the Creator. They were not put there by th e state in the first place. TZ: Were there any Indians represented when they passed the pinenut tax? RT: No, there wasn't. And we have been unpleased and unhappy about the federal government continuing to pass legislation at which the Indians are not represented. And by being represented also I want to state very clearly that not speaking of so- called made-over, white-washed Whiteman's Indians representing us. Because they are THEIR I and they represent them. They don't represent us. The have. In other words, it's not good enough for th e state down one of these slick educated Indians in White man's clothing -- one of the Christianized, made-over Uncle Tom trying to please his master. That's not the answer at all. But, it's what they're doing a great deal of right now. Bu t that's not the answer at all. The fact, is, either we are represented or we are not represented. TZ: How strong are the Traditionalists? RT: That is one thing we prefer not to say. The Shoshone tribe will not let anyone take a census. They've tried several times to take a census but we will not say how many. But I will say this, there are a lot more of us than they think there are. TZ: What have the Shoshones been doing with regard to the draft? RT: Our treaties are treaties of friendshi p and peace. We had to promise to put aside our weapons and not fight again. A nd we're going to keep our treaty. Now they draft every Indian that can walk or crawl, or even sick Indians. Or where an Indian would be the only support for his fa mily or for his old father and mother. So one of these Indians named Richard Willia ms asked for a Tribal Meeting before he was to go to Vietnam. And we had a trib al meeting. He explained how he'd been tricked into the service. They told him to go ahead, that he couldn't do anything else, that he'd have to fight it once he wa s inside. And then after they had him, they gave him no consideration at al l - even though he told them he was the sole support of his parents. And he had a history of rh eumatic fever, his parents were sick - yet they drafted him. So, our people decide d: No more. No more going. Many of the other tribes feel the same way."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"TZ: Has the government been trying to a rrest or induct Indians who refuse to go? RT: Oh, yes. Some of our young men have already gone to jail, some are in jail. Some have gotten out - all stages of it at the present time. But the fact remains they're not going anywhere. Irregardless. TZ: Are there any persons in jail now as a result of refusing to pay the taxes? RT: Not at the present time as far as we know over the refusal to pay taxes. Sometimes we pay taxes out of protest, like they take it out of our pay when we work. Things like that we don' t approve of it at all. And we know that we are in our own country. We are not in somebody else's country or a foreign country. We know we're the first people here. And if there are any taxes to be paid we think it ought to be paid to us. In other words, they're way behind on the rent money. TZ: They've also made a lot of unnecessary improvements. RT: Well, if they would stop improvise' us, we'd be much off, too. A lot of those improvements we can get along out. 'Cause every time they \"improve\" us and try to bring us into that mainstream, it's the sa me thing all over again: lost more land or lost some more of our rights. But now we have no more place to go. The reservations are so small, and many of our people don't have any land. There's mo re Indians live off the reservations than live on. No land. Homeless, displaced people in their own country like one Indian said before I left home, and I like the way he said it, he said: \"The White man's government don't to push us any further.\" In other words we are not aggressive people . What we mean is, they don't want to push us. They don't want to push us. Any more Indian land, they want to respect our rights learn to live with us in this land. There's room here for one. Also room for native people. TZ: The White man is doing a lot to fight that desire to be fair... RT: Certain elements of the White people . I'd rather say we're surprised ourselves at the massive support we got from all peop le all over the world. We got letters from as far as the Philippine Islands. And the d ay after the so-called on Ruby Valley, half the high school kids from the little where I live up in Nevada - some White kids, some Colored kids - all of them came over and wanted to know when next raid was so they could go along. Fact is while it still going on and they got word in town, there were several carloads of them that headed toward Ruby Valley to help us out while it was going on but they got there too late. But it shows the sentim ent, though, of the people, and the young people particularly, th at they don't believe what some of the old guard's been doing. It's very encouraging to us."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"It also shows that our struggle is not a racial struggle. It has a better foundation than that. It's a struggle for human rights. And what affects one of us affects all of us today. And if we resist the things that are being done to us we are actually resisting the same ones that are doin g these things to other people also. TZ: What's going to happen when this st ructure which is now making the laws, resists the change? RT: If they resist too much, they're going to bring about a great deal of destruction. And I've seen that. I am a Medicine Man, and I can look into these things when I want to, and I've seen them. And it's going to be rough, mighty rough, especially in the cities. People will turn on each oth er for any reason and no reason. There will be a general break down of all laws. It'll be uns afe. The only safe places will be far in the back country. And there will be general destruction, I've seen these things smashed that is, the cities will be smashed. I had a dream once. I was with an Indian army. We were coming into a city on horseback. There was no other means of tr ansportation. The city had been smashed by bombs, and there was nothing left. And this was a strange kind of army I wa s with because we had no weapons. We didn't need them, but we were in formatio n anyway when we came into this city. And we knew there was some li fe left. In the far end of one street we found that some buildings were not completely smashe d. There were some old people and some little white babies there. We couldn't take them all, but we took the babies because we knew if we raised those up without any greed, they'd have no greed, and they'd grow up to be good people. So we took those. TZ: Your dream reminds me of the co ncept of the \"True White Brother\"... RT: Well, I've heard different tribes tell it in different but it a ll amounts to the same thing. I've heard that among Hopi, about the White Brother. The way we say it among the Shoshone is a little different, but it amounts to the same thing. They say that someday the White man would be sorry for what he'd done to the Indian, and that the White man would shake hands with the Indian, that someday the White and the Indian would be friends. TZ: When did you have this happe n? When did you have the dream? RT: That's been several years ago. If you me an when WILL it happen, of course I can't set a definite date on that it will happen. Now that's not something we want or desi re. We don't desire any destruction. And we are not either the on (are bringing that condition about, because we are not the"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"doing the things. But we know there are cer tain evil and people working with the establishment that are bringing these things about. TZ: But there is a possibility that this won't happen, that conditions can be changed... RT: It could be changed. Very definitel y. And there's thing to work for, and look forward to, that it should be changed That's up to the people themselves if they have the cc the heart, if they WANT a better li fe. But this destruction -- these wars of aggression, all these things going on now no t necessary. So it would stand to reason then that this destruction is going to come upon them, if they don't change. TZ: What do you think is the way of going about changing RT: I think we have to go back to the beginning, to the beginni ng, you might say of primitive man. Primitive: first, the Latin word - their language. Primitive would mean the most pure. When he was the purest, before I taken up greedy ways, and oriented himself toward that -- profit, gain, and making it at the expense of other people. To get back to the beginning he'd have to go back to the people who are still most traditional, the most primitive and still have those teachings. In the United States we think it is the American Indian, especi ally in relation to this continent. Of course, in other countries there are pr imitive people left there too, like the Tibetans, the Druids in England, other prim itive societies in different places in the world. Some of them are not known or are not publicized. But there's quite a few of them, quite a few of us that know those teac hings, and at the right time we can bring them out. At the present time I and some of my friends who I don't want to mention by name right now, are planning to bring out a record and some books. The record will enumerate some of these prophecies, al ong with some Indian music. We are especially interested in the prophecies that will relate to the younger generation because they are the ones it seems at this times that want to learn. They are the ones who are looking for a better way of life. A nd some of these visions and prophecies will relate directly to them, to their way of life. They will be told at that time. TZ: In the tribes now, how is the educatio nal system set up? Is there a possibility of avoiding the White man's system whic h has been imposed upon the tribes? RT: They kidnap the children in many tribes yet. They send them off to boarding schools for five years at a time so that they won't see their parents to brainwash them, to give them a Christian name, or English name, to speak a foreign language, to make them ashamed they are an Indian . So, when they go home, many of them are confused, many of them will start drinking because they don't know what else to do, and they don't know the answers to many of the problems around them. We resist that as much as possible."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"In some places we are beginning our own schools to teach Indian culture so that these kids will know they are Indian. There are organizations forming at the University of Nevada and different places among the Indian students for the same purpose. It was predicted that in the last days before the day of purification these things would happen. And they're happening all over, everywhere spontaneously. TZ: Has there been much resistance to th e formation of separate schools and organizations? RT: A lot of Indians used to hide their chil dren, but that's pretty hard to do now-a- days now that they have rules, and know just where to find them. But some of them still do keep sending them off to those sc hools. We try to put them in in schools every chance we get because if they go to the Bureau of Indian Affairs of Indian Affairs schools, they really get brainwas hed. They're lined up and marched into a White man's church of some kind or anot her. They're regimented and brainwashed until they have no soul, no spirit. And they're treated pretty tough, badly. But in our own schools it would be a lot be tter because the instruction would be for a different purpose. We don't want our ch ildren to grow up where they lose their identity, are confused, or learn to hate an yone. We want them to learn their true identity, and how they are supposed to liv e in 1 and friendship with all people. TZ: What are the possibilities of taking the entire Indian problem to the United Nations? RT: I'll have to make one slight correction there: There is no Indian problem. What we have is a White man's problem. We could possibly take it to the United Na tions, and probably will at the right time. It's been delivered to them once. Cabot Lodge was there then. And the Indians went there, to the House of Glass on the Waters to the East (the way our rock writers described that). He (Cabot) tried to push th em bodily out of the room. I wasn't there , but that's what I heard, that he tr ied to push them bodily I of the room. And somebody else, from some other country, said wanted to hear what these people have to say, and so they 3 delivered th eir message. The delegat es sat in shocked because they never heard anything like that before. They told them that the United States must stop from their native people, breaking their treaties, and making wars of aggression. If they didn't all of us would be punished. After they delivered their message, they left, and, of course, the rest of the different countries continued doing what th ey'd been doing before. I understand we are supposed to do that one more time, and that's the last time.

As legal advisor I have to read legal documents and interpret what they really mean. Hidden in all the things th ey bring us with all its flowery language is a trick. Somewhere in there, there will be something to take away the land. All the bills in Congress, 137 of them now, everyth ing they're doing - for the Indian on the surface, but somewhere in there is some clause relating to the mortgage of the tribal lands, sale and disposal under the laws of the state in which the land is located. It's all pretty tricky, and I'm the one who is supposed to dig up that tricky legislation between the words an d explain it to the people. TZ: Did you work on the translation of the Omnibus Bill? I know that a great deal of that very difficult job was done by an organization here in Los Angeles - The Traditional Indian Land and Life Committee... RT: The Omnibus Bill was studied and int erpreted by different White friends. In past times we thought we had no White friends at all. In the last two or three years, we've come to realize that there are a lot of good White people who don't approve of the things that are being done, but they don't know about it, or didn't know about it before. Now some of these things are being brought out. The White people who have helped us most are right here in Los Angeles. They help us in a way that we WANT to be helped - to try and prevent legislation harmful to us, and stop some of the things that are being done to us. These people are called the Traditional Indian Land and Life Committee. Any one wanting to help the Indian should contact Zula Brinkerhoff, phone 328-3578, or Thomas Banyacya, Oraibi, Arizona. TZ: The Omnibus Bill (The Indian Land and Resources No. 1812) although promising the Indian huge benefits rewar ds actually (if passed) provides the government with greatest legal weapon to date for stealing and disposing of bit of land still belonging to the Indian. This Bill in would terminate all Indian lands. The definition of Omnibus - and I think it was Mad Bear who said it - a means for conveying people, and it looks like now, as in the past government's getting ready to take the Indian for another. Fortunately, the Bill is tabled for the time being, but I'd like to know is what the Indians throughout the country have done to keep this treacherous piece of legislation being passed. RT: We managed to get the first copi es of the Omnibus There were 25 copies printed for the entire United States Alask a. But we have people working inside the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and inside the puppet organizations that pass us information continuously and keep us well informed. times they know what we are doing; ALL the time we what we are doing."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"So we got one of those 25 copies, and we br ought some of our friends in Los Angeles (Traditional Indian and Life Committee), and they promptly had 500 copies for us. And we promptly saw to it that every trib e United States got a copy. As a result of that, the Omnibus Bill was blocked in the last session of Congress. It was supposed to be passed, and we woul d be presented as usual with the action after they had passed it. But traditional Indians did show up. (In Washington) We couldn't go there because we are too poor, let the Iroquois represent us. Mad Bear Anderson and an Iroquois group took a petition to Washington telling them we didn't want it. And they had some of these made-over Indi ans, in man's clothing, who had all their expenses paid. The waiting in the wing s in case the government needed them. Udall spoke that day, that's how bad they wa nted this Omnibus Bill. He spoke for it at a joint session of the Congress. But no Indian was allowed to speak. The Indians were up in the balcony. And when Udall made the statement, \"All Indians had been consulted,\" the Indians started to boo a nd make catcalls, because all the Indians HADN'T been consulted. In fact a lot of Indians today don't know about that bill. The Senators and Congressmen started look ing over their should ers and the cat was out of the bag that the Indians hadn't been consulted. The Sergeant at Arms went around to quiet the Indians down, but it was too late. The point had already gotten across. That's how the Omnibus Bill was blocked. But it's still pending, and most likely will be brought up again, or else broken down into a lot of smaller bills of the same thing and get shot through. It's a very vicious piece of legislation, one of the most vicious ever hurled at us. We don't need any termination from them. The only termination we need is of the Bureau of Indian Affairs so they keep thei r hands off the Indians. If they terminate the Bureau of Indian Affairs and leave the Indian alone, that would be a step in the right direction. TZ: We don't need more laws RT: We don't need any more laws. We have a few good laws left on the books, and some pretty good treaties in some pla ces - if they would keep their OWN law. TZ: How do you think th e battle is going to go when they break the bill down if they break it down into smaller bills, and attempt to pass them separately? RT: They can do that, and they probably will. They don't seem to want to pay heed to any warning. They don't seem to have any moral obligation left, they don't want to stop at anything.

All I can say is that we will resist, lawfully, and if possible, peacefully. TZ: Not long ago some non-Indians were adopted by Indians (Sky River Rock Festival?) Rolling Thunder, could you give us some idea what the term \"adoption\" signifies to the Indian and to those adopted by Indians? RT: Being an Indian is not a racial thing, it is a Bureau of Indian Affairs term, and even some Indians are confused by it but I'm not. I looked into it some years ago. I don't get information from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. I don't accept their explanations. I asked a long time ago what it meant to be an Indian, they said, \"Great Spirit's Way of Life The Old Men Told Me.\" They sa id it means our way of life, the Great Spirit's Way of Life. Then I asked if a White man or a Colored man could an Indian, and they said yes. They could be, that it is possible. Probably not now, but there will be a time. In other words being an Indian isn't a racial thing. I've seen some pretty dark Indians who were selling out our people, who aren't considered Indians. More and more it is a matter of tradition and because it's true, th at on an individual basis, it's up to me. If I want to adopt those Indian people I can do so. And they have shown that they want to lear n, that 1 want to adopt our way of life. They don't want to change They don't try to missionary us. In fact, they ask us a lot of the time what the answers are, and eventually those answers are being made known to them. TZ: How did you get the name \"Rolling Thunder,\" and did you request this interview be titled, \"Rolling Thunder Speaks?\" RT: Now that I can't tell. I can only tell what the name means. The name means, \"a song to the gods,\" or \"speaking the trut h,\" in all ancient my thology here, and over there. It's the same. TZ: Do you want to elaborate on that at all? RT: No, when I talk to the Indian agent s or the various people they better be prepared to hear the truth. Sometimes it's pretty strong for them, but they better be ready. They're not going like it. TZ: Above all, Rolling Thunder, what is the most importan t thing you wish to stress in this interview?"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"RT: To all people... all we want is to live ou r own way of life, and to live in peace and friendship with all people. We will never be the aggressor in any action that has to be taken. We are only trying to protect our homes, our families and our own lands. We are not going to give up any more. We are aware of the fact that we have nowhere to go, and our people are saying now that the Indians have been pushed far enough. TZ: I think the term \"tribal council\" needs some explanation. RT: When we speak of the tribal councils , we must bear in mind a distinction between the true and original tribal counc ils (the traditional and original chiefs), and those set up under the Bureau of Indian Affairs under terms of the Reorganization Act - about 1937 - for some tribes, which were set up by the government through the true authority of the original chiefs of the councils. It was set up so that these government-organiz ed and sponsored \"councils\" which are generally referred to as \"puppet councils\" among the Indian people - that they could handle all matters pertaining to the business of tribes and rubber stamp things for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the government. It came to be that these so-called \"t ribal councils,\" which are actually an instrument, organization and extension of the power of the federal government and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, came to be referred to as \"puppet council.\" That's the term generally used by all traditional Indian people... TZ: I read in this morning's Times about a government proposal (under an Act of Congress) which was trying to offer money to Indians if they could prove their ancestry as far back as the mid 19th century, and if they could they were to receive a certain amount of money, I believe the sum of $850.00. This proposal or authorization by the federal government was given widespread coverage in the media. In addition, I believe, from other so urces, that the comp ensation referred to involves the purchase of Indian lands previously stolen... (Editor's note: the item refer red to in this question is a rather complex issue dealing with California lands which the government agreed to purchase in 1846 at a price of 14.5 cents per acre, the going rate fortimes . However, before the sale was completed gold was discovered in that part of the country, and the area inundated with prospectors and settlers who seized the land with no thought of compensation or rest to its rightful owners. Th e United States Government was, as blinded by gold in the mother lodes and allowed the prospectors, speculators and settlers to control the territory. This situation existed until an Act of Congress, 1968, decreed that financial compensations shot made to I ndians who could prove their lineage. Thus, in effect, the government is completing a land purchase begun in 1846. However, the price per acre remains at the 1846 value of 14.5 cents. Only in America can the government destroy the concept of robbery, inflation, and interest in one sweeping gesture of legislative generosi ty. Note Rolling Thunder's reply.)"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"RT: This description that the paper give s of this money has something to do (generally) with Indian Claims, which is a department set up by the government. They (the government) set up a special court, appointed the lawyers for the Indians, and then okayed through the puppet councils. The Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Indian affairs okayed these so-called attorneys for the Indians, and it was a cut and dried case from the start. It is a method of swindling the Indian out of his and that's all it amounts to. Of course they'll make a settlement in big ro und figures and it looks like millions of dollars in the newspapers, ma ke it look like the Indian s are going to get a lot of money. But the attorneys of the government are ta king care of that. The attorneys get ten percent off the top PLUS expenses, and that expense goes on for years and doesn't apply to Indian affairs. And then the government comes and takes \"offsets.\" Now that's a nice sounding word for taking more of the Indian 's money - for every Indian that goes school, the cost of the school; for every Indian that was rounded up and placed on a reservation, the cost of roundi ng him up and holding him as a military prisoner - the concentration camps, at that time they called it \"reservations\" - all these expenses can be taken out. Of course, they'll see to it that maybe $150 to $300 are left - there might even be as much as $800 which nowadays isn't much money. It won't buy a modern home. And then the Indian is promptly terminat ed, and he is taxed. Then he receives a letter in the near future that says he ha s to pay a tax even on this \"claim\" money. In many cases he'll find out that he's owing the government money. So it's the biggest fraud ever perpetrated on the Indian people. And this claims case, it's the biggest one of all, it's the final test, and it's to see how many Indians have remained true - and no Indian that's a traditiona l Indian would ever think of selling his mother earth. It would take a drunk Indian or a Chri stianized, made-over White- washed Indian to do that, and he'd have to be very untrue even then. That's not the kind of deal we want to make anyhow. It's a bad deal. (Rolling Thunder is here referring to \"The Indian Claims Act.\") There are other claims we have, other thin gs we could sue for which there would be more money if that's what they want, like minerals, for example, timber, and lease money on lands, many things. But they want to cancel that out. That's why they are shoving these phoney claims deals down the Indian peoples' thr oat at this time. TZ: By termination, you mean the giving up of all claims to land. RT: Yes. They don't call it termination in that way, but the effect is the same. Yes, the Indian loses his land."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"TZ: Rolling Thunder, I would like to return to another question which I asked before, but I'd like some clar ification. At the meeting which took place last June - the pow-wow in Henrietta, Oklahoma - which you said consisted mainly of medicine men and chiefs of the various tribes. You indicated that certain prophecies. were revealed at that time. Could you expl ain these things in further detail? RT: There were many meetings and much that went on I'm not permitted to tell. This meeting was the first of its since the invasion and conque st of this continent. It was in our prophecies that when the me dicine men got together they'd want to watch out. There will be changes. TZ: Could you talk about some of these changes - as told in the prophecies? RT: Some of the changes, yes. They a re becoming known very fast. There will be earthquakes in places where they had eart hquakes before. Recently, they had an earthquake near Chicago in the Midwest, where they never had earthquake before. They are going to have a great deal more wherever native people have been suppressed, and even in some exterminated. There will be no balance of nature in areas, and no control over the natural forc es because they have no one among them who knows the laws of land and life for those areas. TZ: One last question, could you de scribe the Indian idea of money? RT: One of our five basic laws before coming of the man was that they would bring something here which glitter, and use it to trade with. And they would try to buy our land, but we were not to sell. I am sure the Indian people are more qualifie d than any one else in this country to talk about what is American and what is not American because we were the first people and we know what is American - what was original to this continent. There was no ownership or private property - I'm speaking now of a real estate - among the Indian people. The land belongs to the Great Spirit. We Indians were the keepers of the land, and that was our proper status. The land was for use by all the people. Of course were certain tribal areas defined for the use of each tribe th ere might be a garden set aside for a certain individual to grow crops on. But upon leaving that area, the land reverted to tribal status. There was no buying or selling of land. It was against the Great Spirit' s religion because we are told that the earth is our mother, and if we take care of her mother earth - she will take care of us, and that's the way we live.

The article is illustrated by a number of portraits of notable chiefs, the engravings being extra good. One of the most striking portraits is that of Kicking Horse, the Indian who asserts that he was carried in the sp irit to heaven He also has a large, rather handsome face, with mild, intelligent eyes, and especially pleasant appearance. Johnson Sides, the Indian who is credited with innocently being the cause of the present agitation, is represented in his port rait as a man of gent le disposition, his face being devoid of the rugged aspect common to his race. He is known as \"peacemaker.\" The countenance of Sitting Bull is a study. It is more like the face of a white man than that of an Indian in its general contour, with the exception of the high cheek bones, native intelligence and sagacity are ex pressed in every feature, as wee as the deep lines of the face, impressed by habit of internal thoughtfulness. He would be regarded anywhere among observant people, judging from his portrait, as a most unusual man, with many superior points of character. Unprejudiced persons who are willing to put themselves in his place, can come to no other conclusion, on the basis of his career and of traits exhibited by him in the events which terminated his life. We here quote from an article in \"The American\" which is entitled, \"The Red Christ.\" Just when and where the present craze aros e is uncertain. The evidence at present obtainable indicates that it has resulted more from a process of evolution than from the preaching of any one man. The first I ndian who preached the coming of the Red Christ in a manner that attracted attent ion was Short Bull, or Sitting Bull, an Arapahoe who must not be confounded with Sitting Bull, the Sioux chief who took part in the Custer Massacre. This Sitting Bull, or Short Bull, arrived at the Shoshone agency, at Fort Washakie, in Wyoming, about a year ago and announced that he had seen Christ. The new Messiah, he said, told of his previous life upon the earth 1900 years ago and bow the people refused to accept him and showed the scars on his hands and feet where he had been nailed to the cross. He promised that the buffalo and other game should return in th eir former abundance. Then the Messiah gave the Indian buffalo meat to eat and Sitti ng Bull fell asleep. When he awoke, he found he had been transported a long distance in his sleep. Indians do not communicate with one anot her by letters, but send their messages by runners. By word of mouth, Sitting Bull's story was made known to many tribes, and a year ago, a sort of council was held at a place supposed to be on the shore of Walkers Lake, in western Nevada.

Here is one of the accounts of the appearance of the Christ: The next day, as the sun was getting low the people all assemble d about this circle and presently a man was seen walking into it. The people stood about until he had reached the middle of the circle and then they went to meet him. He stood in the midst and talked to them, appearing to be able to talk all languages and to make himself understood by all the tribes presen t. He told the people that things were going to be changed: that the game and the buffalo would be brought back; that they should have again their own country, and that the world would be turned upside down. He closed his speech by saying that in the night he should go to heaven to see God. Next morning about nine or ten o'clock the people again gathered about the circle and presently the Indian Messiah walked in among them. He told them that He had returned from Heaven where He had seen God. Among the Indians present at this counc il was Porcupine northern Cheyenne, who has since been one of the foremost prophe ts of this new Messiah. His story is as follows: What I am going to say is the truth. The two men sitting me were with me and will bear witness that I speak the truth. I my people have been living in ignorance until I went and found out the truth. All the white people and Indians are brothers sisters I was told there. I never knew this before. Th e fisheaters near Pyramid Lake told me that the Christ had appeared on earth again. They said Christ knew he was coming: that eleven of children were also coming from a far land. It appeared Christ had sent for me to go there, and that was wh y, unconscious I took my journey. It had been foreordained. They told when I got there that my Great Father was there also, but I not know who he was. The people assembled, called a council, and the chief's went to see the Great Father who sent word for us to remain 14 in that camp, and that He would come and see us. At the en two days, on the third morning, hundreds of people gathered this place. They cleared a place near the agency in the form circus ring, a nd we all went there. Just before sundown, I saw great many peop le mostly Indians coming dressed in white men's clothes. The Christ was with them. They all formed in this ring around it; and they put up sheets all around the circ le, as they no tents. Just after dark, some of the Indians told me that Christ Fa ther had arrived, I looked around to find Him and finally Him sitting on one side of the ring. He was dressed in a white 1 The next morning He told us He was going away that day, would be back the next morning and talk to us.

But man was given four warnings to that destruction, two of which gave man a chance to change his ways and two of which would give the ch ildren of the Earth time to escape the Creator's wrath.\" \"How will I know these warnings, these si gns?\" Tom asked. Grandfather continued \"They will be obvious to you and those who listen to the Spirit of the Earth but to those who live within the flesh and know on ly flesh, there is no knowing and no understanding. When these signs, these warnings and prophecies, are made manifest, then you will understand the urge ncy of what I speak. Then you will understand why people must not just work for their own spiritual rapture, [Editor's note: Rapture meaning spir itual peace] but to bring that rapture to the consciousness of modern man.\" Tom later wrote in his book The Quest, \"Grandfather was in his forties, and had b een wandering for seve ral years when the vision of the four signs were given to him. He had just finished his third Vision Qu est at the Eternal C ave when the Vision made itself known. He had been seated at the mouth of the cave, awaiting the rising sun, when the spirit of the warrior appeared to him. He felt as if he were in a state somewhere between dream and reality, sleep a nd wakefulness, until the spirit finally spoke and he knew that it was not his imagination. The spirit called Grandfather's name and beckoned him to follow. As Grandfather stood, he was suddenly transported to another world. Again he thought that he was dreaming, but his flesh could feel the reality of this place; his se nses knew that this was a state of abject reality but in another time and place.\" \"The spirit warrior spoke to Grandfather, saying, 'these are the things yet to come that will mark the destruction of man. These things you may never see, but you must work to stop them and pass these wa rnings on to your grandchildren. They are the possible futures of what will come if man does not come back to the Earth and begin to obey the laws of Creation and the Creator. There are four signs, four warnings, that only the children of the Earth will understand. Each warning marks the beginning of a possible future, and as each warning becomes reality, so too, does the future it marks.' With that the spirit warrior was gone and Grandfather was left alone in this strange new world.\" \"The world he was in was like nothing he had ever known. It was a dry place, with little vegetation. In the dist ance he saw a village, yet it was made out of tents and cloth rather than from materials of the Ea rth as he drew closer to the village the stench of death overwhelmed him and he grew sick. He could hear children crying, the moaning of elders, and the sounds of sick ness and despair.

Children could barely walk, elders lay dying, and everywhere were the cries of pain and fear. The stench of death and the sense of hopelessness overwhelmed Grandfather, threatening to drive him from the village. It was then that an elder appeared to Grandfather, at first spea king in a language that he could not understand. Grandfather realized as the elder spoke that he was a spirit of a man, a man no longer of the flesh but a man that had walked a spiritual path, possibly a shaman [Editor's note: Word meaning \"spiri tual leader\" from the language of the Aboriginal Evenki or Tungus Peoples of Sibe ria] of his tribe. It was then that he understood what the old one was trying to tell him.\" \"The elder spoke softly saying, 'Welcome to what will be called the land of starvation. The world will one day look upo n all of this with horror and will blame the famine on the weather and the Earth. This will be the first warning to the world that man cannot live beyond the laws of Creator, nor can he fight Nature. If the world sees that it is to blame for this famine, then a great lesson will be learned. But I am afraid that the world will not blame itse lf but that the blame will be placed on Nature. The world will not see that it created this place of death by forcing these people to have larger families. When the natural laws of the land were broken, the people starved, as Nature starves the deer in winter when their numbers are too many for the land to bear.\" \"The old one continued. 'These people should have been left alone. They once understood how to live with Earth, and th eir wealth was measured in happiness, love, and peace. But all of that was ta ken away from them when the world saw theirs as a primitive society. It was then that the world showed them how to farm and live in a less primitive way. It was the wo rld that forced them to live outside the laws of creation and as a result it is now forcing them to die.' The old man slowly began to walk away, back to death and despair.\" \"He turned one last time to Grandfather and said, 'This will be the first sign. There will come starvation before and after this starvation, but none will capture the attention of the world with such impact as does this one. [Editor's note: the Biafra famine in the 70s captured the atte ntion of the world, but since then notwithstanding all of the media coverage, we have all seemed to accept the famines in Africa and elsewhere as being something natural and inevitable. Most people pay little (if any) attention to it -- much le ss contribute to feeding the hungry there, or even to our own hungry here at home in the United States.] The Children of the Earth will know the lessons that are held in all this pain and death, but the world will only see it as drought and famine, blaming Nature instead of itself.'

He knew that it had been a Vision of the possible future and that the spirit of the Warrior had brought him to it to teach him what could happen.

It was then that Grandfather recalled that th e tribal elder had said that the entire world would take notice but that the worl d would not learn the lessons of what the death and the famine were trying to teach. The Children of the Earth would die in vain.\" \"In a state of physical and emotional exhaus tion, Grandfather fell into a deep sleep, but it was in this sleep that the warrior spirit appeared to him again and brought the remainder of the first sign to completion. In this dream th e spirit spoke to Grandfather saying, 'It is during the years of the famine, the first sign, that mall will be plagued by a disease, a disease that will sweep the land and terrorize the masses. The doctors (white coats) will have no answers for the people and a great cry will arise across the land. The disease will be borne of monkeys, drugs, and sex. [Editor's Note: this is very clearly the A.I.D.S. epidemic] It will destroy man from inside, making common sickness a killing disease. Mankind will bring this disease upon himself as a result of his life, his worshi p of sex and drugs, and a life away from Nature. This, too, is a part of the firs t warning, but again man will not heed this warning and will continue to worship the fa lse gods of sex and the unconscious spirit of drugs.' \" \"The spirit continued, saying, 'The drugs w ill produce wars in the cities of man, and the nations will arise against those wars, ar ise against that killing disease. But the nations will fight in the wrong way, lash ing out at the effect [Editors Note: enslavement] rather than the cause. [Edito rs note: secret pred atory government] It will never win these wars until the nation, until society, changes its values and stops chasing the gods of sex and drugs.' \" \"It is then in the years of the first sign , that man can change the course of the probable future. It is then that he may understand the greater lessons of the famine and the disease. It is then that there can still be hope. But once the second sign of destruction appears, the Earth can only be healed on a spiritual level. Only a spiritual healing can then change the cour se of the probable futures of mankind. With that the warrior spirit let Grandfather fall into a deep and dreamless sleep, allowing him to rest fully before an y more Vision was wrought upon him.\" \"Grandfather awoke at the entrance of the cave once again, the memory of the warrior spirit vivid in his mind, the spirit 's words becoming part of his soul. When Grandfather looked out across the landscape, all had changed. The landscape all had changed. The landscape appeared dryer, there was no vegetation to be seen, and animals lay dying. A great stench of death arose from the land, and the dust was thick and choking, the intense heat oppressive. Looking skyward, the sun seemed to be larger and more intense; no birds or clouds can be seen; and the air"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"seemed thicker still. It was then that th e sky seemed to surge and huge holes began to appear. The holes tore with a resounding, thunderous sound, and the very Earth, rocks, and soil shook. The skin of the sky seemed to be torn open like a series of gaping wounds, and through these wounds seeped a liquid that seemed like the oozing of an infection, a great sea of fl oating garbage, oil, and dead fish. It was through one of these wounds that Grandfather saw the floating bodies of dolphins, accompanied by tremendous upheavals of the Earth and of violent storms.\" \"As he held fast to the trembling Earth his eyes fell from the sky, and all about him, all at once, was disaster. Piles of garbage reached to the skies, fo rests lay cut and dying, coastlines flooded, and storms grew more violent and thund erous. With each passing moment the Earth shook with greater intensity, threatening to tear apart and swallow Grandfather.\" \"Suddenly the Earth stopped shaking and the sky cleared. Out of the dusty air walked the warrior spirit, who stopped a short distance from Grandfather. As Grandfather looked into the face of the spirit he could see that there were great tears flowing from his eyes, and each tear fell to the Earth with a searing sound. The spirit looked at Grandfather for a lo ng moment, then finally spoke, saying, 'Holes in the sky.' Grandfather thought for a moment, then in a questioning, disbelieving manner said, 'Holes in the Sk y?' And the spirit answered, saying, 'They will become the sign of the destruction of man. The holes in the sky and all that you have seen could become man's reality. It is here, at the beginning of this second sign, that man can no longer heal the Earth with ph ysical action. It is here that man must heed the warning and work harder to chan ge the future at hand. But man must not only work physically, he must also work spiritually, through prayer, for only through prayer can man no hope to heal the Earth and himself.\" \"There was a long pause as Grandfather thou ght of to impossibility of holes in the sky. Surely Grandfather knew that there coul d be a spiritual hole, but a hole that the societies of Earth could notice would hardly seem like ly. The spirit drew closer and spoke again, almost in a whisper. 'The se holes are a direct result of man's life, his travel, and the sins of his grandfat hers and grandmothers. These holes, the second sign, will mark the killing of his grandchildren and will become a legacy to man's life away from Nature. It is the time of these holes that will mark a great transition in mankind's thinking. They will then be faced with a choice, a choice to continue the path of destruction or a choice to move back to the philosophy of the Earth and a simpler existence. It is here th at the decision must be made, or all will be lost.' Without another word the spirit turned and walked back into the dust.\" \"Grandfather spent the next four days at the cave entrance, though for the next four days nothing spoke to him, not even the Earth. He said that it was a time of great sorrow, of aloneness, and a time to digest all that had taken place. He knew that these things would not appear in his li fetime, but they had to be passed down to"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"the people of the future, with the same ur gency and power with which they had been delivered to him. But he di d not know how he could expl ain these unlikely events to anyone. Surely the elders and shamans of the tribes would understand but not society, and certainly not anyone who was removed from the Earth and spirit. He sat for the four full days, unmoving, as if made of stone, and his heart felt heavy with the burden he now carried.\" \"It was at the end of the fourth day that th e third Vision came to him. As he gazed out onto the landscape toward the setting sun, the sky suddenly turned back to a liquid and turned blood red. As far as his eyes could see, the sky was solid red, with no variation in shadow, texture, or light . The whole of creation seemed to have grown still, as if awaiting some unseen command. Time, place, and destiny seemed to be in limbo, stilled by the bleeding sky. He gazed for a long ti me at the sky, in a state of awe and terror, for the red colo r of the sky was like nothing he had ever seen in any sunset or sunrise. The color was that of man, not of Nature, and it had a vile stench and texture. It seemed to bur n the Earth wherever it touched. As sunset drifted to night, the stars shone bright red, the color never leaving the sky, and everywhere was heard the cries of fear and pain.\" \"Again the warrior spirit appeared to Grandf ather, but this time as a voice from the sky. Like thunder, the voice shook the landsca pe, saying, 'This, then, is the third sign, the night of the bleeding stars. It w ill become known throughout the world, for the sky in all lands will be red with the bl ood of the sky, day and night. It is then, with this sign of the third probable futu re, that there is no longer hope. Life on Earth as man has lived it will come to an end, and there can be no turning back, physically or spiritually. It is then, if these are not changed during the second sign, that man will surely now the destruction of Earth is at hand. It is then that the children of the Earth must run to the wild places and hide. For when the sky bleeds fire, there will be no safety in the world of man.' \" \"Grandfather sat in shocked horror as the voice continued.’ From this time, when the stars bleed, to the fourth and final sign will be four seasons of peace. [Editor's note: the Indian way of saying one year. The number 4 is sacred, signifying a complete cycle] It is in these four seasons they must live deep within the wild places and find a new home, close to the Earth and the Creator. It is only the children of the Earth that will survive, and they must live the philosophy of the Earth, never returning to the thinking of man. And surv ival will not be enough, for the children of the Earth must also live close to the spirit . So tell them not to hesitate if and when this third sign becomes manifest in the stars, for there are but four seasons to escape.' Grandfather said that the voice and the red sky lingered for a week and then were gone as quickly as they were made manifest.\" \"Grandfather did not remember how many days he'd spent at the mouth of the cave, nor did it make a difference, for he had received the Vision he had come for. It was in the final night at the Eternal C ave that the fourth vision came to Grandfather, this time carried by the voice of a young child. The child spoke,"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"saying, 'The fourth and final sign will appear through the next ten winters following the night that the stars will bleed. During th is time the Earth will heal itself and man will die. For those ten tears the children of the Earth must remain hidden in the wild places, make no permanent camps, and wander to avoid contact with the last remaining forces of man. THEY MUST RE MAIN HIDDEN, like the ancient scouts and fight the urge to go back to the destruction of man. Curiosity could kill many.'\" \"There was a long silence, until Grandfath er spoke to the child spirit, asking, 'And what will happen to the worlds of man?' There was another period of silence until finally the child spoke again. 'There will be a great famine throughout the world, like man cannot imagine. Waters will run vile, the poisons of man's sins running strong in the waters of the soils, lakes, and rivers. Crops will fail, the animals of man will die, and disease will kill the masses. The grandchildren will feed upon the remains of the dead, and all about will be cries of pain and anguish. Roving bands of men will hunt and kill other men for food, and water will always be scarce, getting scarcer with each passing year. The land, th e water, the sky will all be poisoned, and man will live in the wrath of the Creator. Man will hide at first in the cities, but there he will die. A few will run to the w ilderness, but the wilderness will destroy them, for Man will be destroyed, his citi es in ruin, and it is then that the grandchildren will pay for the sins of their grandfathers and grandmothers.' \" \"Is there then no hope? Grandfather asked. The child spoke again, 'There is only hope during the time of the first and second signs. Upon the third sign, the night of the bleeding, there is no longer hope, for only the children of the Earth will survive. Man will be given these warnings: if unheeded, there can be no hope, for only the children of the Earth will purge themselves of the cancers of mankind, of mankind's destructive thinking. It will be the children of the Earth who will bring a new hope to the society, living closer to the Earth and spirit.' Then all was silent, the landscape cleared and returned to normal and Grandf ather stepped from the vision.

I don't think that any event had been left out, and his emotions and thoughts were such that he actually relived it for us. Thus the power of his vision became part of our spirit, our driving force, and a big part of our fears. I sat a long time up on the hill. The fire had retired fo r the night. Creation seemed to be at a standstill awaiting this darkest part of the night to pass by. I felt alone and vulnerable, as if all creation were scrutinizi ng my every thought. I had no idea what to do with what Grandfather had given me through his Vision. How could I ever make a difference or make anyone und erstand the Vision of another?\" \"Grandfather had this Vision sometime in the 1920s, and it was now 1962, still there were no great famines, and certainly no ho les in the sky.

Somewhere in that thought I drifted off into what I thought was a sound sleep.\" Then Tom related how he, himself, saw the same vision of the bleeding stars that Grandfather did, waking later that night in a cold sweat. \"In his dream he screamed for Grandfather, but his scream was silent -- Grandfather's voice broke the silence, sounding older and more hoarse, saying 'How can you not believe in the holes in the sky, the stars that bleed, or the famine? You have borne witness to the impossible before, and you see the impossible happen each day, all around you, yet you say you cannot believe. As you have lived, you have known that faith is the most powerful force on Earth and in the heavens, faith kn ows no fact or reason, transcends the laws of science -- faith is the most powerful. Because you cannot understand how these things can happen, or how to bear wi tness of these things, your faith is shaken and you cannot fully accept them. This sa me young warrior, who has lived in the temples of the wilderness and touched God, who has seen and lived the power of vision and spirit, now cannot comprehend the prophecies set before you.

Before he spoke, Grandfather hus hed him to silence, saying, 'You wonder why I have passed down these visions to you, and what you should do with that knowledge? As I have told you, man mu st work not only for his spiritual enlightenment but also for the spiritual en lightenment of all mankind. For to run and hide, to think only of oneself and not to have love and compassion for all of man, is to deny part of self. [Editor's Note: Now there's a thought!] Man is part of the Spirit-that-moves-in-all-things , and when one part of that spirit is sick, then all are sick; and when one part of that spirit di es, then part of self dies. These visions, these four prophecies, are the things which you should work to resolve, things that lie beyond the self. Thus, by working to keep these prophecies and Visions from becoming reality, and to make the worl d whole again, we become dedicated to something greater than self, and your spirit ual life becomes visible and full.

I t's pow erful stuff; Native American teachings and prophecies affect and relate to all people, and they say, emphatically, this is no time fo r conducting \" business as usual.\" At the core of all Nativ e American relig ions a nd prophecies is a reverence for nature, recognition th at all of creation is a liv e and sacre d and that every part of it-- every plant, animal, hu man, star, and st one--d eserves hon or. Giv ing honor to all creation is a w ay of honoring the Creator, who not only created a ll things from the same cos mic dust, but who is also reflected in all things. We sow the seeds of ou r destruction, Native American prop hecies w arn, as w e destroy the earth, ignorant of our spiritual connection to her and blind to her liv ing spirit. Chief S eattle, chie f of the Suquamish and other Salish tribes of the Pacific Northw est, expressed these ideas most eloquently in his 1854 addre ss to P resident Franklin Pierce: \"... Whatever b efalls the ea rth befalls the sons of the earth. Man did not w eave the w eb of life; he is merely a strand in it. Whatever h e does to th e w eb, he does to himself...

The w hites too sha ll pa ss; perh aps sooner than all other tribes. Contaminate your bed, and you w ill one night suffocate in your own w aste...\""},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"This is the message stressed over and over in Native American prophecies: We are responsible for the drastic earth changes th at are coming. These changes, already in process now, are leading to a new era call ed \"The Eighth Fire\" by the Cree, \"The Day of Regeneration,\" by the Mayan, and \"T he Time of Purification\" by the Hopi. Whatever hope we have of survival during these changes, say the Native Americans, lies in recognizing our spiritual connection to all things and to our Creator. We have only survived thus far, say the Hopi, than ks to those few who have been caring and praying for the earth. The Hopi, or \"People of Peace,\" who live in ancient villages in northeastern Arizona, call the Maker, Maasau. They be lieve that long ago Maasau appointed them as caretakers of the earth, instruct ing them about how to live, and telling them they must follow their instructions, which include their religious practices, in order for nature to stay balanced and life on earth to survive. As Hopi elder Dan Katchongva wrote, \"Together we hold the world in balance, revolving properly. If the Hopi nation vanishes, the motion of the earth will become eccentric, the water will swallow the land, and the people will p erish.\" Also central to Hopi religion and prophecy is the myth of the return of Pahana. The Hopi believe that Maasau gave stone ta blets containing the laws for living to two brothers. Pahana, the fair-skinned eldest brother, traveled east, to the rising sun, to investigate the rest of the world, taking a piece of the original tablets with him. He is to return with the missing piece when he hears his younger brother crying out for help and will help to purify and rebalance the world. The Hopi still have their stone tablet which is held by Hopi elder and leader, Martin Gasheseoma. Pahana's return is imminent, say the Hopi.\" Today, almost all of the prophecies have come to pass. Great roads like rivers pass along the landscape; man talks to man thro ugh the cobwebs of his telephone lines; man travels along the roads in the sky in his airplanes; two great wars have been waged by those bearing the swastika or th e rising sun; man is tampering with the moon and the stars. Most men have strayed from the path shown us by the Great Spirit.\" These ancient prophecies, which, amazingly, foretold of many modern inventions as well as World Wars l and II and present day political corruption are signs of the return of Pahana, who will brin g about the time of purification. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes and flood s, also indicate the coming of the purification. These prophecies, which come from the Hopi and other Native American Nations, strike close to home. Martin Gasheseoma says, \" The increasing earthquakes foretold in Hopi prophecy have already begun, as well as the beginning of worldwide martial law. We knew the earthquakes would start in Cali fornia. I have told visitors from there that they should move out this way, toward Flagstaff or Sedona to be safe.\" The 1989 San Francisco quake and the 1993 Northridge one were just warnings of much larger ones that will rock California. Sun Bear, who was part Chippewa Indian, medicine chief of the Bear Tribe, and a teacher and visionary said, in 1987,\" The"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"earth is an intelligent living being! Before any major changes ever happen upon the Earth Mother, it has warned people. . . . You're going to see major changes here. . . . When I asked the Spirit about the earthquake s, and whether these things could be changed, and what would happen? Spirit sa id it's already sealed. It's already happening...\" A volcano that will devastate the Seattle area is foretold is an ancient prophecy from Washington State's Puyallup tribe, which says,\" The time will come when Little Sister will speak, and Grandfather will answer. And the land will be swept clean to the ocean.\" Sun Bear explained that Donald Matheson, a leader of the Puyallup tribe, moved his people to Idaho in 1979 because he believed it was time for this prophecy to be fulfilled. And, sure enough,\" In March 1980, the mountain that we call little sister began to whisper. May 18th of 1980, the Little Sister spoke with a cubic mi le of mountain that was spread over the northwest area, and many other parts of the world... The Little Sister is called Mount St. Helens. Soon, the Grandfather is going to answer so much bigger. That one is called Mt. Rainer.\" Indian prophecies also foretold wo rldwide environmental catastrophes such as the greenhouse effect, \"changes in the seasons and in the weather, disappearance of wildlife, famine ,\" and the ozone hole, which was referred to as a \"hole in our lodging.\" Martin Gasheseoma said recently that Hopi elders told us that when the plants blossom in the middle of winter, we would need to go to Santa Fe to warn everyone of suffering and destruction to come unless they change their ways. Last year, in the middle of winter the plants began to blo ssom.\" How much suffering and destruction will accompany the time of the purification, and what will be its end result? Some of the prophecies sound quite biblical. Martin Gasheseoma foretells judgment in front of a \"big mirror\" and death to those who are evil and wicked, with only a handful of people surviving in every nation overseas who will then come to this continent, \"which we call heaven.\" Sun Bear's vision is also quite apocalyptic, as he sees the possible death of three fourths of the world' s population. He said, \"If it is necessary that a lot of people die off during the ma jor changes, and that the people that survive are conscious people that are respons ible for the earth and are living on it in harmony and love and respect, then th at is what is supposed to happen...\" The extent of the death and destruction dur ing the time of purification, however, appears to depend on our actions now. \"All the suffering going on in this country with the tornadoes, floods, and earthquake s is carried on the breath of Mother Earth because she is pain,\" says Robert a Blackgoat, an elder of the Independent Dineh (Navajo) Nation at Big Mountain. She explains that the Four Corners area is particularly sacred because it literally holds Mother Earth's internal organs--coal and uranium which the Bureau of Indian Affairs has allowed the Peabody Coal Mine to mine.\" They are trying to take her precious guts out for money,\" says Blackgoat. \"My grandfather told me that coal is like the liver, and uranium is both the heart and lungs of Mother Earth.\" Hopi and Navajo traditiona lists are fighting the mining. Furthermore, the Hopi have b een on a mission, speaking at the United Nations, writing to world leaders, and teaching those who will listen. In a 1982"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"message to the Dalai Lama, David Monongye, a Hopi spiritual leader, explained that \"no show of force must be applied...\" Perh aps there is still time left to reawaken the misguided and prevent disaster. We learne d from our ancestors that man's actions through prayer are so powerful that they deci de the future of life on earth. We can choose whether the great cycles of nature w ill bring forth prosperity or disaster.\" Hopi prophecy not only foretold World Wars I and II, it also predicts that a third Great War is possible. During the third wa r, the \"whole world will shake and turn red.\" But, says Carpenter,\" We hope the third one doesn't occur, because if it does it will probably destroy all life on earth. A nd if it that happens, we will have failed in our purpose here, and we'll have to forfeit our right to live upon this earth as human beings.\" These life and death matters will be determined when Pahana returns and theories abound as to Pahana's identity. Since Pahana has also been called the \"Whi te Brother,\" and since he is to return from the east, Hopi of past centuries wondered whether he could have been a Spaniard or an Anglo and devised tests fo r determining the true Pahana, including knowledge of the greeting of brotherhood, similarities of religious beliefs, and possession of the missing piece of the stone tablet. Many were tested, including Catholics, Baptists, and Mormons, but none passed to the satisfaction of traditional Hopi. What is known, Hopi elder Thomas Banyacya has written, is \"that our true white brother, when he comes, will be a ll powerful and he will wear a red cap and cloak. He will be large in population and be long to no other religion than his very own. He will bring with him the sacred stone tablets. Great will be his coming. None will be able to stand against him.\" Although it is unclear whether Pahana will hold the stone tablets in a literal or a symbolic sense, this passage indicates that he is not a single person, but \"large in populatio n.\" Because Tibetan rinpoches and lamas wear red, and because Tibetan Buddhism has ri tuals similar to Hopi ones, especially the making of sand paintings as a hea ling and meditation tool, many wonder whether Pahana could be represented, in part, by the arrival of the Tibetan spiritual community. And traditional Hopi, in recent years, have initiated meetings with Tibetan holy men to explore this possibility. Many scholars have also pointed out the universality of the myth of the returning brother and teacher in time of dire need . The Hopi prophecy of the return of Pahana is similar to the Christian prophecy of the Second Coming as well as to many other Indian prophecies, including the Aztec's Quetzalcoatl and the Mayan's Kukulcan. And, truly spine tingling, is the fa ct that the timing of the fulfillment of these prophecies coincides with our mi llennial time period. The Mayans, who mapped the lunar and solar cycles with great accuracy, created a system of seventeen calendars that reflects and predicts cycles of change, which range in length from fifty-two to 26,000 years. One of these cycles, called the Mayan Great Cycle has duration of 5,200 years. It be gan on August 9, 3114 B.C. and ends on December 21, 2012. Mayan prophecy refers to this time as \"the day of regeneration,\" which means, according to Hunbatz Men, a Mayan medicine man and elder, that Mayan knowledge will be resurrected and that we will recognize our Creator, whom the Mayan call \"Hunab Ku.\""},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"In order to help fulfill this prophec y, Hunbat z Men and other Mayan elders are bringing back Mayan rituals to ancient sa cred places.

With that ener gy, we are going to w ake up those centers, activate them, and w ake up society.\" Fulf illment of ancien t Native A merican prophecy may have played out right here in the Haight Ashbury The hippies who embraced Native America n teachings, and preached a gospel of peace and love w ere part of the \"a wakening\" or \"Seventh Fire,\" according to Vernon Harper, a Northern Cree elder, me dicine man a nd spiritual leader. Ha rper believes the Seventh Fire occurred in the 1960 s because Cree prophecies said that it would be \"a time w hen the Rainbow People and the People of Color w ould appe ar and be like children.\" He believes these people w ere the hippies. Carlos Santana echoed this idea w hen he eulogized Jerry Garcia, say ing, “Jerry really cared for the higher good of all people. He w as a reincarnated American Indian. That's w hat a hippie is: a rai nbow war rior.\" Hippies and New Agers w ho respect and want to learn from Native Amer ican teachings may be part of the \" large population\" that represent the return of Pahana, say some. Sun Bear spoke of an old Hopi prophecy th at foretold a time w hen Native American teachings w ould be forgotten even by most Indians. But after about a hundred years, Nativ e American relig ions would rev ive and many w ould seek its know ledge, including \"the people who had co me from across the Great Waters, their sons and daughters... w ould say to us, `Teach us, because w e have almost destroyed the earth.'\" Ha rper sees this time in a posi tive light and provide s some inspirationa l words about w hat is to come and how to p repare for it. \"Now we believe that w e're into the Eig hth Fire, and w e don't see this as fo rete lling do om and gloom.

There was the cycle of the plant. And now we are in the cycle of the animal comi ng to the end of that and beginning the cycle of the human being. When we get into the cycle of the human being, the highest and greatest powers that we have will be released to us. At the beginning of this cycle of ti me, long ago, the Great Spirit made an appearance and gathered the peoples of this earth together, and said to the human beings, \"I'm going to send you to four direc tions, and over time I'm going to change you to four colors, but I'm going to give you some teachings, and you will call these the Original Teachings; when you come back together with each other, you will share these so that you can live and have pe ace on earth, and a great civilization will come about. During the cycle of time, I'm going to give each of you two stone tablets. When I give you those stone tablets, don't cast them upon the ground. If any of the sisters and brothers cast their tablets on the ground, not only will human beings have a hard time, but almost the earth itself will die.\" And so He gave each of us a responsibilit y, and we call that the Guardianship. To the Indian people, the red people, He gave the Guardianship of the Earth. We were to learn during this cycle of time the teac hings of the earth, the plants that grow from the earth, the foods that you can eat, and the herbs that heal so that, when we came back together with the other sist ers and brothers, we could share this knowledge with them. Something good was to happen on the earth. To the South He gave the yellow race of people the Guardianship of the Wind. They were to learn about the sky and breathing a nd how to take that within ourselves for spiritual advancement. They were to sh are that with us at this time. To the West He gave the black race of peop le the Guardianship of the Water. They were to learn the teachings of the water, wh ich is the chief of the elements, being the most humble and the most powerful. The elders have told me that the black people would bring the teachings of the water. To the North He gave the white race of peop le the Guardianship of the Fire. If you look at the center of many of the things they do, you will find the fire. They say a light bulb is the white man's fire. If you look at the center of a car you will find a spark. If you look at the center of the ai rplane and the train you will find the fire. The fire consumes, and also moves. This is why it was the white sisters and brothers who began to move upon the face of the earth and reunite us as a human family. And so a long time passed, and the Grea t Spirit gave each of the four races two stone tablets. Ours are kept at the Hopi Reservation in Arizona at Four Corners Area on Third Mesa. I talked to people fr om the black race, an d their stone tablets"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"are at the foot of Mount Kenya. They are kept by the Kikuyu Tribe. I was at an Indian spiritual gathering about 15 year s ago. A medicine man from South Dakota put a beaded medicine wheel in the middle of the gathering. It had the four colors from the four directions; he asked the pe ople, \"Where is this from?\" They said, \"Probably Montana, or South Dakota, mayb e Saskatchewan.\" He said, \"This is from Kenya.\" It was beaded just like ours, with the same colors. The stone tablets of the yellow race of people are kept by the Tibetans. If you went straight through the Hopi Reservation to the other side of the world, you would come out in Tibet. The Tibetan word for sun is the Hopi word for moon, and the Hopi word for sun is the Tibetan word for moon. The guardians of the traditions of the people of Europe are the Swiss. In Switzerland, they still have a day when ea ch family brings out its mask. They still know the colors of the families, and they still know the symbols, some of them. Each of these four peoples happens to live in the mountains. Each of the four races went to their directi ons and learned their teachings. It was in Newsweek not long ago that eight out of te n foods that people eat on the earth are developed here in the western hemisphere b ecause that was our Guardianship -- to learn the teachings of the earth and the thin gs that grow from the earth. We were given a sacred handshake to show, when we came back together as sisters and brothers, that we still remembered the teachings. It was indicated on the stone tablets that the Hopis had that the first sisters and brothers who would come back to them would come as tu rtles across the land. They would be human beings, but they would come as turtles. So when the time came close, the Hopis were at a special village to welcome the turtles that would come across the land. They got up in the mornin g and looked out at the sunrise. They looked out across the desert, and they saw the Spanish conquistadors coming, covered in armor, like turtles across the land. So this was them. So they went out to the Spanish man, and they extended their hand, hoping for the handshake. But into the hand the Spanish man dropped a trinket. And so word spread throughout North America that there was going to be a hard time, that maybe some of the brothers and sisters had forgotten the sacredness of all things and all the human beings were going to suffer for this on the earth. So tribes began to send people to the mount ains to have visions to try to figure out how they could survive. At that time there were 100,000 cities in the Mississippi Valley alone, called the mound civilization: cities built on great mounds. Those mounds are still there. They began to try to learn to live off the land because they knew a hard time was going to come. They began to send people to have visions to see how we could survive this time. They w ere told in the propheci es that we should try to remind all the people that would come here of the sacredness of all things. If we could do that, then there would be peace on earth. But if we did not do that, if we"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"had not come together as a human famil y, th e Grea t Spirit w ould grab the earth with His hand and sha ke it. Mound locations The elders on the w est coast prophesied th at they w ould then begin to build a black ribbon. And on this black ribbon there w ould move a bug. And when you begin to see this bug moving on the land, th at w as th e sign for the First Shaking of the Earth. The First Shaking of the Earth would be so violent that this bug w ould be shaken off the earth into the air and it w ould begin to move and fly in the air. And by the end of this sha king this bug will be in t he air arou nd the w orld. Behind it w ould be a trail of dirt and eventually the w hole sk y of the entire ea rth w ould become dirty from these trails of dirt, and this would cause many diseases that w ould get more and more complicated. So the bug moving on the land, of course it's easy to see n ow. In 1908 the Model-T Ford w as mas s-produced for the first time. So the elders knew the First Sh aking of the Earth w as about to co me about -- that w as the First Wo rld War. In the First World War the airplan e came into w ide usage for the firs t time. That was that bug moving in to the sky. And so they knew something very important would happen. There would be an attemp t to make pea ce on earth on the w est coast of this land, and so the elders bega n to w atch for this. They began to hear that th ere was going t o be a League of Natio ns in San Francisco, so the elders gathered in Ari zona ar ound 1920 or so, and they w rote a letter to Woodrow Wil son. They asked if the Indian people could be inclu ded in the League of Nations. The United States Supreme Court had held that a reservation is a separate and semi-sovereign nation, not a part of the Un ited States but protected by it. This became a concern because people didn't w ant the res erv ations to become mo re and more separate. They didn't w ant them to be considered nations. So they did not write back, and the Native people w ere left ou t of the Lea gue of Nations so that circle w as incomplete. In the League of Nati ons circle the re w as a southern door, the yellow people; there w as a w estern door, the black people; th ere w as a northern door, the white people; but the eastern door was not atten ded. The elders knew that peace w ould not come on the earth until the circle of hu manity is co mplete, until all"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"the four colors sat in the circle and sha red their teachings—then peace would come on earth. So they knew things would happen. Things would speed up a little it. There would be a cobweb built around the earth, and people would talk across this cobweb. When this talking cobweb, the telephone, wa s built around the earth, a sign of life would appear in the east, but it would ti lt and bring death (the swastika of the Nazis). It would come with the sun. But th e sun itself would rise one day, not in the east but in the west (the rising sun of the Japanese Empire). So the elders said when you see the sun rising in the east, and you see the sign of life reversed and tilted in the east, you know that th e Great Death is to come upon the earth, and now the Great Spirit will grab the earth again in His hand and shake it, and this shaking will be worse than the first. So the sign of life reversed and tilted, we call that the Swastika and the rising sun in the east was the Rising Sun of Japan. These two symbols are carved in stone in Arizona. Wh en the elders saw these two flags, they knew that these were the signs that the earth was to be shaken again. The worse misuse of the Guardianship of th e fire is called the gourd of ashes. They said the gourd of ashes will fall from the air. It will make the people like blades of grass in the prairie fire, and things will not grow for many seasons. The atomic bomb, the gourd of ashes, it was the best -kept secret in the history of the US. The elders wanted to speak about it in 1920. They would have spoken of it and foretold it s coming if they could have entered into the League of Nations. The elders tried to contact President Roosevelt to ask him not to use the gourd of ashes because it wo uld have a great effect on the earth and eventually cause even greater destruction and a the Third Shaking of the Earth, the Third World War. So they knew after the Second Shaking of the Earth when they saw the gourd of ashes fall from the sky, there would be an a ttempt to make peace on the other side of this land. And because the peace attempt on the west coast had failed, they would build a special house on the east coast of this Turtle Island, and all the nations and peoples of the earth would come to this ho use, and it would be called the House of Mica, and it would shine like the mica on the desert shines. So the elders began to see they were building the United Nations made out of glass that reflects like the mica on the desert so they knew this wa s the House of Mica, and all the peoples of the earth should go to it. So they met and talked about this. They said that in the 1920's they had written and they had not been responded to, so they said this time we'd better go to the front door of the Hous e of Mica because th ings might get a lot worse. So elders representing a number of tribes drove to New York City. When the United Nations opened, they went to the front door of the house of Mica and they said these words, 'We represent the indigenous peop le of North America, and we wish to"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"address the nations of the Earth.

Four days later they came back, and I believe the na tions of the earth heard that the Indians had come to the door. And they voted to let the Indians in. They wanted to hear what they had to say. But the United States is one of five nations of the United Nations with a veto power, and still they were concerned because this time the Native sovereignty was even stronger. And I believe they vetoed the entrance of the Native people So then they knew other things would happe n on the Earth. So they retreated to the Six Nations Reserve, and they talked abou t this, and they said the time is really getting close now -- 1949. They said, \"We're go ing to divide the United States into four sections, and each year we're going to have a gathering. We're going to call these the White Roots of Peace Gathering s.\" They began to have these around 1950. And they authorized certain people to spea k in English for the fi rst time about these prophecies. One that I used to listen to many time s, over and over, was Thomas Banyacya. He was authorized to speak in English about wh at was on the stone tablets, and he has dedicated his life to doing this. And they began to tell us at these gatherings, \"You're going to see a time in your lifetime when the human beings are going to find the blueprint that makes us.\" They call th at now DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid. They said, \"They're going to cut this blueprint. \" They call that now genetic splicing. And they said, \"They're going to make new anim als upon the earth, and they're going to think these are going to help us. And it's going to seem like they do help us. But maybe the grandchildren and great-grandchild ren are going to suffer.\" The elders said long ago, \"They will release these things, and they will use them.\" This is going to be released not too long from now. They are making new animals. The elders talked about this. They said, \"You will s ee new animals, and even the old animals will come back, animals that people thought had disappeared. They will find them here and there. They'll begin to reappear.\" They said, \"You're going to see a time when the eagle will fly its highest in the night, and it will land upon the moon. And at that time, many of the Native people will be sleeping,\" which symbolically means they h ave lost their teachi ngs. We're at that time now. The Eagle has landed on the moon, 1969. When that spaceship landed, they sent back the message, \"The Eagle has landed.\" Traditionally, Native people from clear up in the Inuit region have shared with us this prophecy, clear down to the Quechuas in South America. At this time you're going to see that things will speed up, that people on the earth will move faster and faster. Grandchildren will not have time for grandparents. Parents will not have time for children. It will seem like time is going faster and faster. The elders advised us that, as th ings speed up, you yourself should slow"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"down. The faster things go, the slower you go. Because there's going to come a time when the earth is going to be shaken a third time. The Great Spirit has shaken the earth two times: the First and Second World Wars to remind us that we are a human family, to remind us that we should have greeted each other as brothers and sisters. We had a chance after each shaking to come together in a circle that would have brought peace on earth, but we missed that. Tonight they were talking on the news abou t the sign for the Third Shaking of the Earth. They said they're going to build wh at the elders called the house in the sky. In the 1950's they talked about this: they w ill build a house and throw it in the sky. When you see people living in the sky on a permanent basis, you will know the Great Spirit is about to grab the earth, this time not with one hand, but with both hands. When this house is in the sky, the Great Spirit is going to shake the Earth a third time, and whoever dropped that gourd of ashes, upon them it is going to drop. They say at that time there will be villages in this land so great that when you stand in the villages you will not be able to see out, and in the prophecies these are called villages of stone, or prairies of stone. And they said the stone will grow up from the ground, and you will not be able to see beyond the village. At the center of each and every one of these villages will be Native people, and they will walk as hollow shells upon a prairie of stone. They said hollow shells, which means they will have lost any of their tr aditional understandings; they will be empty within. They said that, aft er the Eagle lands on the moon, some of these people will begin to leave these prairies of stone and come home and take up some of the old ways and begin to make themselves rebor n, because it's a new day. But many will not. And they said there's going to come a time when in the morning the sun is going to rise, and this village of stone will be there, and in the evening there would just be steam coming from the ground. They will be as steam. And in the center of many of those villages of stone, when they turn to steam, the Native people will turn to steam also because they never woke up and left the village. They say there's going to be the Third Shaking of the Earth. It's not going to be a good thing to see, but we will survive it. We will survive it. And when we survive it, there's going to be another attempt to ma ke a circle of the human beings on the earth. And this time the Native people will not have to petition to join but will be invited to enter the circle because they s ay the attitude toward us will have changed by then, and people will let us into the ci rcle, and all the four colors of the four directions will share their wisdom, and there w ill be a peace on earth. This is coming close. The prophecies are always either/or. We could have come together way back there in 1565, and we could have had a great civili zation, but we didn't. Always along the path of these prophecies, we could have come together. We still could. If we could stop the racial and religio us disharmony, we would not have to go through this third shaking.

Our culture is among the most ancient continuously existing cultures in the w orld. We still remember the earliest do ings of human beings. We remember the original instructions of the Crea tors of Life on this place w e call \"Etenoha\"—Mother Earth. We are the spiritual guardians of this place. We are the \"Ongw hehonw he\"—the Real People. In the begin ning w e were told human bein gs who w alk about on Earth have been provided w ith all th ings necessary for life . We w ere instructed to ca rry a love for one another, and to show a great respect fo r all the beings of this Earth. We are shown that our life exis ts w ith the tree life , that our w ell-being depends on the well- being of the Vegetable Life, that w e are cl ose relatives of the four-legged beings. In our w ays, s piritual con sciousness is the highes t form o f po litics. Ours is a Way of Life. We be liev e all living th ings are spir itual beings . Spirit can be expressed a s energy forms manifes ted in ma tter. A blade of grass is an energy form manifes ted in matter— grass matter. The sp irit of grass is that unseen force w hich produces the species o f grass, and it is ma nifest to us in th e form of real grass. All things o f the w orld are real, materia l thin gs. Creation is a true material phenomenon, and manifests itself to us th rough reality. The spiritua l universe, th en, is manifest to Man as Crea tion, the Creation which supports life. We believe th at man is real, a part of Creation, an d that his d uty is to su pport Life in conjunction with the other beings. That is w hy w e call ourselves Ongwhehonw he —Real People. The origina l instructio ns direct that w e who w alk about on the Earth are to exp ress a great respect, an affection, and a gratit ude to ward all the spirits w hich create a nd"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"support Life. We give a greeting and thanks giving to the many supporters of our own lives—the corn, beans, squash, the winds , the sun. When people cease to respect and express gratitude for these many things, then all life will be destroyed, and human life on this planet will come to an end. Our roots are deep in the lands where we live. We have a great love for our country, for our birthplace is there. The soil is rich from the bones of thousands of our generations. Each of us were created in those lands, and it is our duty to take great care of them, because from these lands w ill spring the future generations of the Ongwhehonwhe. We walk about with a g reat respect, for Earth is a very sacred place. We are not a people who demand or ask anything of the Creators of Life, but instead, we give greetings and thanksgiving that all the forces of Life are still at work. We deeply understand our relationship to all living things. To this day, the territories we still hold are filled with trees, animals, and the other gifts of the Creation. In these places we still receive our nourishment from our Mother Earth. We have seen that not all people of Eart h show the same kind of respect for this world and its beings. The Indo-European people who have colonized our lands have shown very little respect for the things that create and support Life. We believe these people ceased their respect for the world a long time ago. Many thousands of years ago, all the people of the world belie ved in the same Way of Life, that of harmony with the universe. All liv ed according to the Natural Ways. Around ten thousand years ago, peoples who spoke Indo-European languages lived in the area which today we know as the Steppes of Russia. At that time, they were a Natural World people who lived off the land. They developed agriculture, and it's said that they had begun the practice of animal domestication. Hunters and gatherers who roamed the area probably acquired animals from agricultural people, and adopted an economy based on herding and breeding animals. Herding and breeding animals signaled a basic alteration in the relations of humans to other life forms. It set in motion one of the true revolutions in human history. Until herding, humans depended on Nature for the reproductive powers of the animals. With the advent of herding, human s assumed a function which for all time was the function of animals' spirits. Sometime after th is history records the first appearance of social organization known as \"patriarchy.\" The area between Tigris and Euphrates Rivers was homeland in ancient times of various peoples, many of whom spoke Semitic languages. Semitic people were among the first in the world to develop irrigation technology. This led to early development of towns, and eventually citi es. Manipulation of waters, another form of spirit life, represented another way humans developed a technology which reproduced a function of Nature."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Within these cultures, strati fied hierarchal social organ ization crystallized. Ancient civilizations developed imperialism, partly b ecause of the very nature of cities. Cities are obviously population concentrations. Mo st importantly though, they are places which must import the material needs of this concentration from the countryside. This means that the Natural World must be subjugated, extracted from and exploited in the interest of the city. To gi ve order to this process, the Semitic world developed early codes of law. They also de veloped the idea of monotheism to serve as spiritual model for their mat erial and political organization. Much of the history of the ancient world recounts the struggles between the Indo- Europeans and the Semitic peoples. Over a period of several millennia, the two cultures clashed and blended. By the s econd millennia B.C. some Indo-Europeans, specifically the Greeks, adopted the practice of building cities, thus becoming involved in the process which they named \"Civilization.\" Both cultures developed technologies p eculiar to civilization. Semitic peoples invented kilns to enable the creation of pottery for trade and storage of surpluses. Early kilns eventually evolved into ovens wh ich could generate enough heat to smelt metals, notably copper, tin and bronze. Indo-Europeans began smelting iron. Rome fell heir to these two cultures, a nd became the place where the final meshing occurs. Rome is also the true birthpla ce of Christianity. The process that has become the culture of the West is histor ically and linguistically a Semitic/Indo- European culture, but has been commonl y termed the Judeo-Christian tradition. Christianity was an absolutely essential elem ent in early development of this kind of technology. Christianity advocated only one God—a religion imposed exclusive of all others. Local people of European fores ts believed in the spirits of the forest, waters, hills and land; Christianity attacked those beliefs and effectively de- spiritualized the European world. Christia n peoples, possessed superior weaponry and a need for expansion, were able to mili tarily subjugate Europe's tribal peoples. Iron led to developing tools to cut down the forest, the source of charcoal to make more tools. Newly cleared land was then turned by newly developed iron plow, pulled for the first time by horses. With that technology many fewer people would work much more land, and many other peop le were effectively displaced to become soldiers and landless peasants. The rise of that technology ushered in the Feudal Age and made possible, eventually, the rise of new cities and growing trade. It also spelled the beginning of the end of the Euro pean forest, although that process took a long time to complete. The eventual rise of cities and concu rrent rise of European state created the expansion and search for markets which led men, such as Columbus, to sail across the Atlantic. Development of sailing vesse ls and navigation technologies made the European \"discovery\" of the Americas inevitable."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The Americas provided Europeans a vast ne w area for expansion and material exploitation. Initially, the Americas provided new and even finished materials for the developing world economy, which was based on Indo-European technologies. European civilization has a history of ri sing and falling as its technologies reach their material and cultural limits. The fi nite Natural world has always provided a kind of built-in contradiction to Western expansion. Indo-Europeans attacked every aspect of North America with unparalleled zeal. Native people were ruthlessly destroyed because they were an unassimilable elements to the civilizations of the West. Forests provided materials for larger ships, the land was fresh and fertile for agricult ural surpluses, and some areas provided sources of slave labor for conquering in vaders. By the time of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-Nineteenth Century, North America was already a leader in the development of extractive technology. Hardwood forests of the Northeast were not cleared for to provide farmlands. Those forests were destroyed to create charcoal fo r the forges of the iron smelters and blacksmiths. By the 1890's, the West had turn ed to coal, a fossil fuel, to provide the energy necessary for the many new forms of machinery, which had been developed. In the first half of the 20th Century, oil replaced coal as a source of energy. The Western culture has been horribly expl oitative and destructive of the Natural World. Over 140 species of birds and animals were utterly destroyed since the European arrival in the Americas, largely because they were unusable in the eyes of the invaders. The forests were leveled, the waters polluted, Native people subjected to genocide. Vast herds of herbivores were reduced to mere handfuls, buffalo nearly became extinct. Western technology and th e people who employed it have been the most amazingly destructive force in all of human history. No natural disaster has ever destroyed as much. Not even the Ice Ages counted as many victims. But like hardwood forests, fossil fuels are al so finite resources. As the second half of the Twentieth Century has progressed, the pe ople of the West h ave begun looking to other forms of energy to motivate their technology. Their eyes have settled on atomic energy, a form of energy producti on which has by-products which are the most poisonous substances ever know to Man. Today the species of Man is facing a question of the very survival of the species. The way of life known as Western Civilization is on a death path on which their own culture has no viable answers. When faced with the reality of their own destructiveness, they can only go forward into areas of more efficient destruction. The appearance of Plutonium on this planet is the clearest of signals our species is in trouble. It is a signal which most Westerners have chosen to ignore. Air is foul, waters poisoned, trees dying, animals disappearing. We think even the systems of weather are changing. Our ancien t teaching warned us if Man interfered with Natural Laws, these things would come to be. When the last of the Natural"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Way of Life is gone, all hope for human su rvival will be gone with it. And our Way of Life is fast disappearing, a vict im of these destructive processes. The other position papers of the Haudenosaunee outline our analysis of economic and legal oppression. But our essential me ssage to the world is a basic call to consciousness. Destruction of Native cultures and people is the same process which has destroyed and is destroying life on this planet. Technologies and social systems which have destroyed animal and plant life area also destroying Native people. And that process is Western Civilization. We know that there area many people in the world who can quickly grasp the intent of our message. But experience has taught us that there are few who are willing to seek out a method for moving toward any rea l change. But if there is to be a future for all beings on this planet, we must begin to seek the avenues of change. Processes of colonialism and imperialism which affected the Haudenosaunee are but a microcosm of the processes affecting the world. The system of reservations employed against our people is a microcosm of the system of exploitation used against the whole world. Since the time of Marco Polo, the West has been refining a process that mystified the peoples of the Earth. The majority of the world doesn't find its roots in Western culture or traditions. The majority finds its roots in the Natural World, and the Natural World, and traditions of Natural World peoples, must prevail if we are to develop truly free, egalitarian societies. It is necessary, at this time, that we begin a process of critical an alysis of the West's historical processes to seek out the actual nature of the ro ots of the exploitative and oppressive conditions which are forced upon humanity. At the same time, as we gain understanding of those processes, we must reinterpret that histor y to the people of the world. It is the people of the West, ultimately, who are the most oppressed and exploited. They are burdened by the weig ht of centuries of racism, sexism, and ignorance which has rendered their people insensitive to the true nature of their lives. We must all consciously and continuously challenge every model, every program, and every process the West tries to force upo n us. Paulo Friere wrote in his book the Pedagogy of the Oppressed that it is the nature of the oppressed to imitate the oppressor and by such actions try to gain relief from the oppressive condition. We must learn to resist that response to oppression. People living on this planet need to break with the narrow concept of human liberation, and begin to see liberation as something which needs to be extended to the whole Natural World. What is needed is liberation of all things that support Life—air, waters, trees—all things wh ich support the sacred Web of Life."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"We feel Native peoples of the Wes tern He misp here can co ntinue to co ntribute to the survival potential of the human species.

To strive to become A ni yun w i yah is to ackn ow ledge the desire by a Cherokee to become a principled person, but they must first choose God's w hite path of peace, w hich is what the ancient Chero kees sought.

Approximately 3500 to 4000 years ago, Cherokee legend says that they w ere visited by a spiritu al being w ho taught the se \"Principle people\" how to live in peace w animals an d humans, and how to have the proper resp ect fo r nature. The legend has caused many Cherokee and other peop believe that it w as Christ, or a manifestation of someone like him, who chose to ap pear, giving instruction s and prophecies to the Cherokee people. Is this possible? I f we compare it to the simila rity of the accou nts of God appearing or making Himself know n unto men in the Old Testament Christian Bible, then w e can only agree that the legend of the Cherokee people is poss ibly accurate and true. Because this instructio n is w idely believe d to have alread y occurred once in human history, another appearance to other hum ans is less difficult to understand and believe, a s there is supp orting ev idence of tribal stories ex actly like the Old Testament Bible w ithin several Semitic tr ibes, and globally in many indigenous tribes. ith le to Remember that all thin gs true are not contai ned w ithin the Bible, w hich is not to say that w hat is in the Bible is not true. A map of the United States is not in the Bible; it is not re lev ant to the c ore messag e of the Bib le. The historical Bib le's setting on ly allow s the reader to better understand the intended message. Thus, when the ancient Cherokee sang, spoke, and chante d, as w as heard a nd documented by several Europeans as late as 1755, the name s \" Shiloh\", \"Head of All Things\", \"Ye ho w ah\", \"t he Sun of Righteousness\", a nd \"the Morning Star\", they w ere using names or titles w hich were both Old Te stamen t and Cherokee religiou s w ords or phrases for God.

In Cherokee, Go d w as called \"U nay klah nah hey\", the \"Creator of All Things\"; th e other five na mes w ere also used to describe Go d or the spiritual perso n the Chero kees believed that he sent to earth to instruct them. The ancient Cherokees also knew what a sw ine w as before the Europeans imported such, and had a prohibition against eating sw ine and many other foods considered unclean. Cherokees w ould keep on e day w ithout w ork for prayer. Cherokee w ould marry only outside of their clan. A Cherokee w oman could divorce h er husband without physical violence to her.

Also occurring approximately 3500 to 4000 years ago, the Cherokee language separated from the Iroquois language group and stayed separated, because the vast majority of Cherokee w ords changed radica lly w ith the addition of new words, logically because of integration w ith some oth er peoples and their lan guage.

When a Cherokee is asked, even in this present time, whether part blood or full blood, if they strictly consider themselves subjectively a Native American and/or something else, a great many of these Ch erokees will reply that being Cherokee is being \"something else\", or Native American plus something else. Ancient Cherokees didn't know Jesus by that name, but they said in 1750 that they knew God was to appear on earth as a man and they ca lled this person by five different Old Testament names for Jesus. Also consider th at the Cherokees had three actual cities of refuge, they had the stories of the fl ood, and many other Old Testament stories, and that they also had the prohibitions found within the Ten Commandments. These ancient Cherokee religious words and teachings, as practiced and followed by the ancient Cherokee, were apparently fr om a time period of between 500 B.C., when the Jewish tribes (one of several Se mitic language groups) first obtained the ability to read and write in Aramaic and st arted writing down what we call the Old Testament, and 4000 B.C., where the story of Noah (which was known by all of these Semitic language tribes, both Jewish and no n Jewish) first appeared in Semitic (non Jewish) writings, the Gilgam esh scrolls. The second oldest known writing of the story of Noah and the flood is in India. Clea rly, these early stories are the actual and physical property of mankind, not any sp ecific people, from the beginning of history, which was oral tradition before writing came into being. The Cherokee language is, in structure, like the Iroquois language; however, almost all of the words are different. “O’siyo” in Cherokee means “hello;” “Casiho” in Sanskrit (the oldest mother language of all European, East Indian, Arabic, and Semitic languages) means “hello” also. In prehistoric times, there were Africans in Central America and southern called th e Olmecs who apparently traveled from Africa to Central America. Whether they were lost or simply superb seafarers is not known, but they did have what appears to be a magnetic compass with them, predating the Egyptians by 2700 years. If one group of people can make that journey, why not another? And if another people did so, would they not, due to favorable ocean currents being absolutely necessary for such a journey, be from an area which could be the Mediterranean coas t, the Canary Islands, Egypt, or the Middle East, which are close to these blac k Africans who colonized Central America and southern Mexico? Remember that these are the areas north of Africa where tribal stories say that God is said to have spoken to man, as is believed by Christians, Jews and Muslims. These are th e exact same religious stories which are in the first four books of the Old Testamen t that are, as of today, read and believed by Muslims, Jews, and Christians, almost a billion people.

Im mediately both sides acted to pull the Cherokees apart. Although the French w ere diplomatic, the English were able to supply guns and ammunitions, as well as other militant resources the Cherokees desired. In the mid 1700s, the French were losing control to the British and the Cherokee leaders of Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia were being pitted against one another. Some Cherokees did discern what was happening and sought to turn the tables on the foreigners. In the last half of the ei ghteenth century, the whites began a rivalry for tribal control between the leaders of the towns of great Tellico and Chota. The Cherokees were kept in a constant state of turmoil and their ways of life became forever interrupted by the ways of the new world. Throughout the late eighteenth century, tribal leader Attakullakulla controlled tribal policy by learning the import ways of the white colonization and began guiding tribal policy away from the old w ays of Cherokee life. He encouraged the Cherokees to cooperate more closely with th e white settlers. During Attakullakulla tribal reign, farming replaced hunting as th e dominant economic factor. The wars between tribes stopped. He also bargained for colonial forts and military garrisons to protect the Cherokees from warring ne ighbors. None of Attakullakulla efforts resolved the Cherokees problems. Their settlements were always in the way of relentless white settlers, which resulted in waves of wars from 1756 to 1794. Much of the Cherokee settlements were annihilated. Tame Doe, the sister of Attakullakulla, gave birth to a daughter named Nancy. Nancy grew up and married the noted war leader Kingfisher of the Deer Clan. She was at his side in 1755 when he was killed by the Creek warriors at the battle of Taliwa. Nancy immediately picked up hi s weapons and gathered the Cherokee warriors to an overwhelming victory. Chota ch ose her to fulfill th e vacant position of a Beloved Woman. The Cherokees believe that the Supreme Beings spoke to the people through Beloved Women. They were also given the power and authority to make decisions on what to do with prisoners of war.

The Cherokees had a Sacred Ark that carried the sacred fires and other Holy things, which were the fragments of their religious beliefs - fragments that represented the everlasting bond between the creator and the Cherokee people. During the time of Moses, it is recorded that ancient Israel had poor memory and often forgot about the great works of God and would not wait for His counsel. ( Psalm 106:813, Psalm 78:38 42 ) Like ancient Israel, over a period of time the Cherokees slowly began to forget the fragments of their ancient religious belie fs. There were many accounts and revisions to the Mortality Story. One could only sp eculate that, through time, the Cherokees' memory became poor and much of their an cient beliefs were lost. Modifications to the stories over the years have lead to doubt and confusion. The Christian Bible says that God is not the author of confusion ( 1 Corinthians 14:33 ). The Creator made it clear to the Cherokee people that changes or modifications of the ancient beliefs were only profitable if they were progr essing and continuing in their beliefs. However, if the modifications were attempts to conform to popular belief, they would experience disastrous results in their religion and government. Over time the Religious Festivals of th e Cherokee people became obsolete. The festivals showed their devotion to the Creator and the keeping of His commandments. It was a time where they fasted, prayed, and gave thanksgiving offerings of the first fruits to the \"Maker of all things\"; a time of cleansing and purification from the old so Ye ho waah could bring in the new. The old fires were put out and new sacred fires were placed in every home. The new fires represented cleansing, rebuilding and lighting. Ancient tradition also says that Ye ho waah commanded the people to rest from all work on the seventh day and to show thei r adoration for him by holding their hands entirely still while they rested with their palms open and upward on their knees. The people were to confine themselves to talk about the Supreme Being that dwells on high on the seventh day. CULTURAL TRANSFORMATION"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"(Photo - Right) A tradition al seven sided house. Seven is a sacred number for the Cherokee. Most historians tend to deal w ith the political aspects of the Cherokee culture.

In time the fragments of the Cherokee ancien t beliefs w ould be lo st as the w hites cunningly planned to pierce the Cherokee relig ion so erosion w ould set in. White men w anted to capitaliz e on the Indians. The Cherokees had become a grand and glorious people of influ ence and prosperity.

What started out innocently, turned out to be a conversion to the w hites' manner of life. Soon th e fragments of thei r an cient belie fs would be lost in the transformation of their culture. Although the whites enjoyed trad e w ith the Cherokees, conflicts ov er land and money w ould occur.

They became a people of uncertainty. In doubt and confusion, some of the clans began to let the w hites guide them as trusting children. So me Cherokees did not permit their clans to marry outsiders. The full bloods began to be persuaded by the whites and mixed bloods, which caused the al tering of th eir festival procedures, and more importantly the p ractical training of thes e procedures. For example, the green corn fest iva l orig inally taught young me n to publicly proclaim their w ork for and support of their mothers (remember, this was before social security or governmen t support). The mixed bloods began to out number th e fu ll bloods. A s they increased in number, the pow er of the Cherokee religion d eclined.

In 1736, a Jesuit named Christian Priber sp ent 9 years w ith the Cherokee people. His mission w as both politic al and religious. He gained great favor an d influence with tribal leaders. Priber became an unoffi cial secretary to the prin cipal head man. Nevertheless, he served both the church and French government. His primary goal was to disrupt tribal relations betw een the Cherokees and the Englis h traders a nd colonist. Eventually he w as captur ed and imprisoned by the English. Later the Catholic Church made attempts to work as missionaries among the Cherokee p eople. Their efforts to convert and educate w ere unsucces sful until more contempora ry times. In 1740, Cherokees obtained their first horses and a trail w as opened betw een Augusta, Georgia and the Cherokee Country. Tw enty years later, the Cherokees possessed large herds of horses.

The white men's government began changing as well. The clan tribal loyalty was compromised by the demands of a newly formed republican government. The French and the English became rivals. Im mediately both sides acted to pull the Cherokees apart. Although the French w ere diplomatic, the English were able to supply guns and ammunitions, as well as other militant resources the Cherokees desired. In the mid 1700s, the French were losing control to the British and the Cherokee leaders of Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia were being pitted against one another. Some Cherokees did discern what was happening and sought to turn the tables on the foreigners. In the last half of the ei ghteenth century, the whites began a rivalry for tribal control between the leaders of the towns of great Tellico and Chota. The Cherokees were kept in a constant state of turmoil and their ways of life became forever interrupted by the ways of the new world. Throughout the late eighteenth century, tribal leader Attakullakulla controlled tribal policy by learning the import ways of the white colonization and began guiding tribal policy away from the old w ays of Cherokee life. He encouraged the Cherokees to cooperate more closely with th e white settlers. During Attakullakulla tribal reign, farming replaced hunting as th e dominant economic factor. The wars between tribes stopped. He also bargained for colonial forts and military garrisons to protect the Cherokees from warring ne ighbors. None of Attakullakulla efforts resolved the Cherokees problems. Their settlements were always in the way of relentless white settlers, which resulted in waves of wars from 1756 to 1794. Much of the Cherokee settlements were annihilated. Tame Doe, the sister of Attakullakulla, gave birth to a daughter named Nancy. Nancy grew up and married the noted war leader Kingfisher of the Deer Clan. She was at his side in 1755 when he was killed by the Creek warriors at the battle of Taliwa. Nancy immediately picked up hi s weapons and gathered the Cherokee warriors to an overwhelming victory. Chota ch ose her to fulfill th e vacant position of a Beloved Woman. The Cherokees believe that the Supreme Beings spoke to the people through Beloved Women. They were also given the power and authority to make decisions on what to do with prisoners of war. Nancy also headed up an influential women's council that consisted of a representative from each Cherokee Clan, and she sat as a voting member of the council of the Chiefs.

THE CREATOR HAS HIGH STANDARDS FOR HIS COVENANT PEOPLES The Creator allows peoples that are truly evil or hypocritical peoples to scourge \"chosen\" people who have backslidden a nd become wicked, and then destroys the evil or hypocritical people who were used to scourge the \"chosen\" people after the evil/hypocritical ones boas t of their accomplishment. Both the written records from the eastern hemisphere, and the oral records from the western hemisphere speak of a \"beard ed god\" who covenanted with peoples in both hemispheres, and taught the same codes of behavior in both sides of the earth. We will show in detail in Book #2 that C reator sent a representative who covenanted with BOTH the ancient people in the East ern Hemisphere, and with the indigenous peoples in the Western Hemisphere.

The Sumerians vanished as an identifiable people, but they left behind their myths. Their clay tablet records indicate they were founded by \"The Annunaki\" who were human space travelers -- who looked like us -- from off of this pl anet, from a planet called Niburu, which traverses our sun once every 3,600 years or so. A very ancient collision had occurred between a moon of Niburu and one of Niburu's moons, which cut our planet in half, transferred oceans to Earth, and smashed into the other half of earth of earth -- creating the iron-nickel asteroid belt between Earth and Mars. The other half of our planet was hurled clos er to the sun at that time into what is now the third planet position. Each time Niburu passes; it c reates massive upheavals in the solar system, huge meteorite showers on Earth, and a pole shift and geological changes on Earth due to earthquakes and volcanism. Sumerian records indicate th at the Annunaki set up a si ster civilization in the Western Hemisphere led by Viracocha. The Hebrews descended from Abraham. Revered writings of Judaism record that Abraham came from the city of Ur in Sumer. The people of Sumer produced the first written language. Sumerian literature influenced Akkadian, Hittite, Canaanite, and biblical literature. Bible records spea k of how the Creator covenanted with Abraham and his descendants the Hebrews. The Creator punishes His covenant people when they break that agreement. When Jesus came to fulfill the cove nant with the Hebrews, he said \" other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them al so I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.\" Verbal histories of many western hemisphere native cultures record the visit of a \"white, bearded god.\" The"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Book of Mormon records a visit from Jesu s, after Three Days of Darkness, which are predicted once again in these end times.

And Sumerians wrote lamentations, complaining th at the blood of their people filled holes in their grounds like hot bronze in a mold. They wrote of bodies dissolving like fat in the sun and their cities covered with a shroud of smoke. What weakness if any among the Sumerians prevented them from successfully defending themselves remains unknown. But the Sumerian writers of lamentations saw their demise as the result of their gods having abando ned them like migrating birds. Source: Ibid. The Babylonians believed that the gods punish ed people for lack of respect for god- given laws. And during the reign of Hammurabi's son, around 1800 BCE, the Babylonians believed that such a punishment had arrived in the form of an invasion by those called Kassites, from the mountai nous region just east of Mesopotamia -- the first people known to have entered Mesopotamia on horseback.

Case Study #1 - The Cherokee"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The Cherokee had an ancient system of la ws from time immemorial. Their laws were in many ways similar to those of the Sumerians and their descendants the Hebrews. In 1750 Chief Attacullaculla recalled the ancient story of how they migrated west from the \"rising sun.\" They moved to and prospered in South America -- and later to North America -- unt il they allowed their priests to break some sacred laws about 500 years ago. Th en Columbus arrived and everything changed in North America. They had rel ocated to the American mainland from their island homeland after holy men told them that their island, which was surrounded by undrinkable (ocean) water, wa s going to be destroyed. There was equality among them and they held all la nds \"in common\" up until relocation to what is now Oklahoma. The white American government which surrounded the Cherokee eventually adopted a corrupted version of the Iroquois / 6 Nations government which did not allow for equal rights, setting the Nation up for an internal war 80 years later over \"state's rights\" or sovereignty, with slavery as a side issue. Women did not receive their rights until even later. After the Cherokee adopted a government sim ilar to that of the Americans in the early 1820's and 30's, a message was delivered to the Cherokee National Council by several Cherokee holy men -- warning them to return to their old ways and practices. The Speaker of the National Co mmittee, Major Ridge, became very angry with them, and railed against them in council, and the National Council refused to listen to them. That group, the \"Eastern Cherokee\" of yesterday soon lost 1/4th of their population on the Trail of Tears, and lost all their lands east of the Mississippi. The \"Oconoluftee\" Cherokee had given up ci tizenship in the Cherokee Nation after the war of 1812, and took U.S. federal-cont rolled reservations, and were forced by the U.S Government to help round up their 1000 or so cousins who evaded the Trail of Tears. The \"Eastern Cherokee\" of to day are their descendants. Many of the traditional-thinking citizens of the Chero kee Nation heeded their holy men. The \"Old Settlers\" or \"Western Cherokee\" and the \"Chickamauga Cherokee\" migrated west between 1750 and 1830 in order to avoid white encroachment, and did not suffer the loss of life and were not relocated if they blended into the white populations of Missouri, Arkansas a nd Alabama, and were eventually denied political recognition by the ones who walked the Trail of Tears and wrested the established federally recognized political government from the Western Cherokee. The Cherokee fought an internal war with much loss of life in the 1840s, and Cherokee factions took different sides in the Civil War, and today, the Cherokee are a divided and scattered nation, close relatives hating each other, because they did not listen to their Creator.

Case Study #3- The Hopi The Hopi, through rock pictograms and oral traditions just as stringent as the written traditions among the Jews, were long ago told to expect white men coming with the \"sign of the cross,\" but if thes e white men were \"out of balance\" they would cause troubles for the Hopi rather than be beneficial to the Hopi if they were \"balanced.\" Apparently, the whites who eventually arrived were \"out of balance,\" because they imprisoned many Hopis who refused to accept changes the whites wanted to make. Later, many Hopi joined the nearby white religion, which has caused a lot of loss of culture and family turmoil among the Hopi and others in that region. Case Study #4- The Tanna Islanders The Tanna Islanders of the Vanuatu archip elago in the Pacific were visited in the 1930's by a personage with the same description as the personage who visited Wovoka. They called him John Frum (as in \"John from America\") The Tanna islander's description of John Frum was identical to the description Wovoka made of Jesus... bearded, not as light-skinned as a typical white man, not as dark-skinned as an Indian, but in between. John Frum wa s described as a multi-lingual man able to speak many dialects as well as English. The Tanna islanders were given basically the same message that was given to Wovoka. He commanded the islanders to reject the orders of the local missionaries and return to their native religious practices. John Frum promised the natives that if th ey returned to their native beliefs, he would return to the island one day in a golden airplane. Perhaps if the Europeans who invaded the Americas and the Pacific had been living their religion, Creator would have told th e Indigenous people to follow them, but Creator did not.

PUTTING THE ENTIRE END-TIME PICTURE TOGETHER USING PROPHECIES FROM ALL DIFFERENT CULTURES We are the seventh generation sp oken of in Native prophecies. It is said \"Timing is everything\" in life. Prophecies from many different cultures, properly assembled and compared in the book, give you a picture of where we stand, and hopefully the impetus to make the proper changes in your life... or to make preparations for the worst, e.g. Traditionalist Hopi spokesperson Thomas Banyacya commented in a personal interv iew with the editor, that his family \"stored enough food grains to last for 7 years.\" The Mormon culture, living nearby the Hopi, were originally admonished by Brigham Young to enough store for 7 years, then it was reduced to two years after Brigham Young's death, and then to 1 ye ar after the turn of 1900... and nowadays most Mormons don't even worry about it, because their leaders are asleep. It was most recently taught that Mormons should store one year’s supply of food. The Hopi and Pueblo elders, as well as many others, have long taught their people to have a one or two-year supply of food st ored, in case of adversity or emergency. Leaders of these prepared groups are today warning the earth’s inhabitants of a fast approaching time of hardship, great change, and the need to be prepared, both spiritually and physically. Traditional Ho pi, as well as others, do not accept government support, and maintain agricultura l self-sufficiency instead. Some Hopi believe they were told by the White Broth er to never accept aid, or their land would be taken away from them. Their Anasazi ancestors inhabited a changeable land with many enemies, and food storage meant survival again st incessant enemy attacks and the unpredictability of dr ought conditions in the Southwest. SO WHERE DO WE STAND IN TH E TIMELINE AND SCHEME OF PROPHECY? The following hint is handed down to us in this Bible prophecy:"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Luke 17:25 (Speaking of Jesus) But firs t must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation. 26 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. 27 They did ea t, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that N oah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. In the days of Noe (Noah), Sodom and Gomo rrah was in full swing with all manner or evil being practiced, evils that are being practiced once again today. Perhaps you know how those two cities were destroyed by fire from heaven. From that scripture we know that the bad human behaviors th at forced Creator's decision to destroy most of the people in the world would be going on, once again, in the latter days -- IN THE DAYS WE NOW LIVE IN. CREATOR ALWAYS SENDS WARNING MESSAGES FIRST BEFORE ACTING Remember... the Bible says: \"Surely th e Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.\" Amos 3:7 Our Creator always sent prophets/holy me n to His people, who carried prophetic messages of warning before He allows or causes such things to happen. This is as true today as it was long ago, or He would be a liar and cease to be God. In this eBook, we will provide you with all the proof that any reasonable person would need in order to be convinced that very soon, a \"Day of Purification\" as described by the Hopi -- or \"Chastisement\" as describe d by Catholics -- or \"Three Days of Darkness\" as described by Catholics, Mohammedans, The Book of Mormon, and the Jewish man Alois Irlmaier will occur, followed by the dawning of a very different and wonderful world -- with little or no crime, fear, or bloodshed for 1000 years. Concerning the 1000 years, Mahatma Gandhi said: \"Mankind is approaching hard times, because as soon as the measure of it s sins will be full, it will be called to account by the superior power above us. You may call this event as you wish: Judgment day, final settlement, or doomsd ay. It will come, most likely, very soon. Whoever will survive this settlement will see an entirely new earthly existence manifested. For a long, very long time the world war will be crossed out from the dictionary of mankind, perhaps even for all time. The soon-coming \"The Three Days of Dark ness\" (noted in the past AND predicted for the future and by most ALL religious cu ltures) will be similar to the \"passover\" of the Old Testament. When the descendants of Abraham were enslaved in Egypt, they were told to paint their lintel of the doorpost s with blood of a lamb so that the destroying angel would bypass their home s and not kill their firstborn children. \"And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch ou t thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.

This final latter-day \"Passover\" will be si milar, and more detailed instructions for your survival are given here. Once we convince you that you need to p repare physically and spiritually, we will then begin to show you that there is a way to live, a sacred way -- resembling tribalism -- that will give you protection from the coming calamities so you will survive to live on in the new world.

Jesus said in Matthew 13:35: \"I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.\" Only recently, several different groups of Native American elders, Iroquois, Hopi, Algonquin, among the most closed mouth people in the world -- have recently announced that it was time to reveal the mysteries -- but few if any Indians are listening -- a phenomenon which was also pr ophesied to occur at this time. Crazy Horse prophesied on this very subject just before his assassination, that the \"Young Whites\" would listen to Indians someday. Th is theme is also reprised in the Hopi prophecies, with an age-old prediction that could only have pointed to the Hippies of the 1960s. The Hopi play a key role in the survival of the human race through their vital communion with the unseen forces that hold nature in balance, as an example of a practical alternative to the suicidal man -made system, and as a fulcrum of world events.

A third witness of the predicted “red skies” was provided in Cath olic tradition by Caesarius Heisterbach of Prum. As a fourth witness , the “Three Days of Darkness” was recorded in the Book of Mormon just prior to the visit of Jesus to American Indians in the western hemisphere soon after his death and resurrection in Jerusalem: 3 Nephi 8 [3] And the people began to look with great earnestness for the sign which had been given by the prophet Samuel, th e Lamanite, yea, for the time that there should be darkness for the sp ace of three days over the face of the land.

Proverbs 29:25 : “The fear of man brings a snare, But whoever trusts in the LORD shall be safe.” FOREWARNED IS FOREARMED: KNOWLEDGE IS KING Just as Jesus Christ has made a significan t impact on Christians, so has the \"True White Brother\" impacted Native Am ericans. In 1519, the Spanish explorer Hernando Cortez discovered the Aztec capital in present-day Mexico and was accepted because he matched the description of their god-king Quetzalcoatl. Quetzalcoatl was light-skinned and bearded. He told the Aztecs that He would return someday (“Cortez, Hernando” 234-235). Throughout the Western Hemisphere are severa l tribes with the belief of a similar god of theirs. Commonly known as the True White Brother, this man has several names such as: The Miracle One, Waicoma h, Es-me-shee, My Grandfather, The Prophet, Hea-wah-sah, Wis-ah-co, The Sacred One, Wakea, Waikano, Chee-Zoos, Paruxti, The Dawn God, The Pale God, The Healer, The Great One, Yeh-ho-vah, Great Azoma, Mahnt-Azoma, Great Kate-A zhl, Teo-Wakan, Tama, Cama, Caboy, Sume, Vira-Cocha, The Fire God, Tlazom a, Ahunt Azoma, E-see-cotl, Tacomah, Feathered Serpent, Emeeshetotl, Ee-see co -tl, Tla-acomah, Tacobya, The Great Ta- copah, Plumed Serpent, Gu-kumatz, Kul-kul-kan, Lord of Wind and Water, Itz- amna, Itza-Matul, Zac-Mutal, The Mighty, The Saintly One Who Worshipped No Idols, The Ah-Pope, Hunab-Ku, Mahnt-Azoma. Another things Christians shy away from is \"serpents.\" You may notice a lot of \"serpent\" titles in the paragraph above, and most Christians (most of whom let their church leaders do their thinking fo r them) are conditioned by hysterical (or ignorant) church leaders who teach Christians to recoil at the mention of a \"serpent!\" They seem to forget that 1. Jesus said we needed to be \"wise as serpents\" and 2. It was the \"Brazen serpent\" (now recognized as the \"Caduceus symbol\" of modern medicine) that was provided by th eir God, to be lifted up on a stick for them to simply look at in order to be he aled from the bites of the \"fiery serpents.\" Sadly, most did not look and died.

Almost two thousand years ago a mysterious white man walked from tribe to tribe among the American Nations. He came to Peru from the Pacific, He traveled through South and Central America, among the Mayans, into Mexico and all of North America, then back to ancient Tu la, from whence he departed across the Atlantic to the land of his origin. Who wa s this white Prophet who spoke a thousand languages, healed the sick, raised the dead , and taught in the same words as Jesus Himself? These are true Indian legends, gathered durin g twenty-five years of research by L. Taylor Hansen, archaeologist, from many different tribes all over the Americas. By consulting museums, libraries and experts on folk-lore, it has been possible to correlate the findings into this fascinatin g book, backed up by the spades of the diggers into ancient ruins, and by all the sciences with which L. Taylor Hansen is familiar. This is a book that will back up the New Testament of the East, with the Christian Indian legends of the West. In this book is proof that the Savior came not only to one continent, but to all the world. This book will strengthen your faith as no other could! Lucille Taylor Hansen, the author of this book, is the daughter of Professor Frank Taylor, who was co-originator of the ( 1910) famous Taylor-Wegener Theory of Continental Drift, which is now universally accepted. She is also author of \"The Ancient Atlantic,\" a scholarly history of that ocean and the peoples and lands around it.

EXCERPTS FROM HE WALKED THE AMERICAS It is not clear which tribe the True Wh ite Brother appeared to first, but in Polynesia, He is said to have walked toward them on the water. The first thing they noticed was His white skin. He was unlike th eir people; white, bearded, long-curling hair. They saw His eyes, strange eyes they th ought, they were the color of the sea. He came with others from boats, which he signaled to come. Their garments were different, they were not white, but colored. They looked at their Master with a deep respect. He went about the vi llage and as soon as His hand touched the injured or dying, they were healed. Wakea, as they call ed him, spoke their language and told them of the One God who ruled the Heavens and of His law to Love One Another. Each morning, Wakea would pray toward th e dawn star and prayed for His friends in a far-off land across the ocean. When He had to leave, He was asked would He come again. He answered, “One day you w ill se me returning, even as I came, through the light of the dawning, if you remember to keep my commandments and always love one another” (pg. 20). Polynesi an scholars say Wakea visited them in the “first century of the Christian Era, or generally speaking, in the time of Jesus” (pg. 21) . (L. Taylor Hansen, He Walked the Americas, Amherst Press, Amherst Wisconsin 14-21) In Peru, it is said that Wako stood upon His temple with his gold-tinted robe and ordered the dismissal of idols and with th at, He cleansed His temple. He changed a warlike nation into one of peace and content. In Brazil lives the Waikanoes; a non- Christian wild tribe who says Waikano wore golden sandals and a white toga. He taught them the uses of specific seeds for drug, food, clothing, and spices. He taught them many ceremonies, baptismal rites and sa cred marriage. He taught them that in His Father’s Land are many lodges that await their coming beyond the veil. (L. Taylor Hansen, He Walked the Americas, Amherst Press, Amherst Wisconsin 22-25) In Guatemala, the Pale One stepped toward a great cat and he ld up His arm as a symbol of peace. The cat fell over as if worshipping the Him. Wild tribes in Guatemala still repeat this st ory. He spoke of His business in the land; “I come to you in the name of My Father - the one and only god of mankind. I bid you cease these sacrifices” (pg. 29). Th e Pale One had in each hand a large cross torn in the flesh. He spoke of His father who “dwells beyond the rainbow. He lives in the lava, moves in the oceans, breathes in the wind storm and made all things from ant to tiger” (pg. 30). He often spoke of the Grea t Law of the Father: Love One Another. (L.

In explaining the Keetoowah wampum be lts in the 1984 documentary video, Chief William Smith stated that The Ancient Keet oowah are told that they are the Chief Indian Tribe in the Americas, and that if and when the Great Spirit speak to the Indians in the Americas, they will deliver the message to the Keetoowahs first.

Many Cherokees believe that it is basically the same practice taught by Jesus and his disciple, John the Baptist. Also, Cherokee people have long worshipped a creator whom our ancestors called the Three Above Beings: One God in Three Persons. Cherokees stories tell us that Creator sent hi s spiritual beings to tell us of his son long before Europeans came to this land. People have to decide for themselves whether they will accept these stories. Chero kee elders say that they are true, while some anthropologists say that our people obtained these stories from missionaries. However, the writings of the missionar ies tell of their own amazement at our Cherokee ancestors' understanding of what wa s being told to them. There are many parallels, including the Cherokee names of Creator and his son that sound very similar to the names that other peoples h ave used: 'Yowa' or 'Yehowa' for Creator and 'Tsisa' for Creator's son. Before the Trail of Tears, from 1838 to 1839, when thousands of our people were removed from their ancestral homeland in the East, many of them were already Christian. There were many Christian hymns sung in the Cherokee language as our people traveled along the trail, including one that has become the Cherokee national hymn. It is sung to the tune of 'Amazi ng Grace,' although the words are very different from the English-language version. It tells the Cherokee people that Tsisa - - Jesus -- has gone away to heaven to prepare a place for us, but that he has given his promise to return for us some day. The Cherokees have long had a name fo r those who are called Christian in the English language. We are Tsuneladi, 'Those Who Follow Creator's Son.'

These teachings are almost identical to the 10 commandments. After living with them for a short time, He said that He had to visit others. He said that one day He wo uld return and gave the Hopi signs and prophecies for when that day would be. Th ese signs and prophecies were written on stone tablets, which are still in existen ce today in Arizona, which also includes the handprint of the True White Brother. Befo re the Great Star appeared as they say, they used to be a fierce people, kill ing many. They were converted to the worshipping of the Great Spirit before th e True White Brother even came. Then buried their weapons and made a covenant with the Great White Spirit that they would never kill again.

Taylor Hansen, He Walked the Americas, Amherst Press, Amherst Wisconsin p.91) . He organized His Church wherever he went, calling 12 disciples and a successor. He taught of His past, and of the future. Up and down the Western Hemisphere walked the True White Brother preaching the essentials of a peaceful society. Could it be that Jesus and the True White Brother is in fact the same person? When Jesus said He had other sheep of a differe nt fold to attend to (John 10:16), did He mean the Native Americans? Surely the de scription in the Bible of Jesus and the description of the True White Brother to the tribes are similar in many ways. Perhaps the names Chee-Zoos and Yeh-ho-vah are actually the names Jesus and Jehovah in a different tongue. More similar are the lessons taught by Jesus and the True White Brother. It is of the writer’s opinion that this man, some call Him Jesus Christ, some call Him Quetzalcoatl, some call Him Yeshua, some call Him Wakea, did come to the earth and brought a message of love and peace. Because of His different audiences, He taught using different methods. Perh aps this is the case with other religions as well. Perhaps we are all more similar than different. While focusing on differences brings about hate , focusing on similarities brings about peace. THE HOPI - GOD'S CHOSEN PEOPLE IN AMERICA As the Creator chose the House of Israel (descendants of Abraham) in the Eastern Hemisphere to be His \"chosen people,\" He chose the Hopi in the Americas to be His"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"\"chosen people.\" It will be shown in this eBook that the Hopi language and the Hebrew Language have the same source: Sumeria. Sumeria is the most ancient civilization on the planet, dating back 13,000 years, a civilization shown by their ancient written records, and the records of the Babylonians, Assyrians, Hittites, Egyptians and Hebrews to have been seeded by space travelers... the Nephilim (Hebrew: Those who fell from the sky) or \"Annunakim.\" Perhaps unlike their other modern cousins in the eastern hemisphere, the Hopi are just as comfortable in speaking about and meeting with an \"space alien\" as they would be with any human. WHERE THE HOPI CAME FROM According to their oral history (which they are as fastidious to keep pure as the Jews have been in transmitting the Tora h), they did not migrate to this land but came in ships, arriving in what is now Central America. They were a bloodthirsty people, continually at war with their brot her tribes. Then came a time when they decided to change their ways. They buried their weapons in the ground, and make a covenant to not shed blood any more. B ecause they had such a long history of violence, their enemies did not believ e their change and came upon them, slaughtering them. But as they saw their sincerity in their conviction, that they would not lift up their swords to defend them selves, many of their brothers joined with them. They moved to a new location further North and their brother tribes made a pact with them to protect them , and they in turn gave them food. They eventually moved north until they came to where they are today. If I remember correctly, it was there that the 'M assau' appeared to them and taught them skills of living and told them prophecies of the future. HOPI PROPHECY They describe three 'shakings' that are obvious references to World Wars I, II and III. The third would not happen if the people turned to God, learning from the first two; but if not, it would be far worse than either the first or the second. The first two were as if with 'one hand,' while the third shaking would be 'with both hands.' The nation that dropped the 'gourd of as hes,' destroying everything where it landed, during the 'second shaking,' would in turn have a 'gourd of ashes' dropped on it during the third. They were instructed to not become too dependant on the marvels of technology including electricity and runni ng water that these people would bring forth because during this third shaking these conveniences would be taken away. They were told to store enough food and water to last 't hree seasons.'

TIBETAN COUSINS In a recent interview with the second assistant to the Dalai Lama, they tell of a story as well of a visit of a “True White Broth er,” though the person interviewed did not personally believe that this visitor was Go d in the flesh, though others do believe that. There was about a 200 year period of peace following that visit. According to their legends, th eir final destination is not Tibet, but in the West where they will go after a time of destructio n to join their true brothers. They (paraphrasing) 'will fly on birds with metal wings to another land to build the city...' The Tibetans also have one of the stone ta blets given long ago to the various races: red, yellow, white, and black. The head Lamas of Tibet recently said to ancient manuscript expert Glen Kimball, \"We own your Jesus.\" The Buddhists have an extremely strong interest in Jesus because of the manuscripts that survived in their libraries and the visits of Jesus to the East during his earlier life. There a re two main Buddha figures in Buddhism. One is the original Buddha Darhma who lived in 640 BC and came out of the Brahman traditions. (Brahman traditions a re thought today as being the traditions once over lightly of Abraham--thus the simila rity in the name) The second, now said by the head Lamas of Tibet to be the g reatest of all the Buddha's is the “Buddha Issa.” His teachings and writings survive in our day, including his admissions that he was Jesus Christ, born in Nazareth and who had to “return to Jerusalem to finish” his mission and “be crucified.” Both of these books are currently part of a collection of sacred religious texts held by the Dalai Lama. They have about sixty thousand sacred texts in their libraries, unlike the book-burning mentality of the western religions. Source: http://www.ancientmanuscripts.com/books/buddaissa.htm . MASSAU'U The Hopi remember Creator (or His son) well as the terribly disfigured \"Massau'u\" who hid behind a ragged mask. (Compare the \"Marred Servan t\" of the Holy Bible) \"Suddenly, Massau would pop out of the cornpile and start chasing the men around.

THE HOPI'S DESCRIPTIO N OF THE CREATOR Long before Bahanna (white man) came upon our land, when Massau, the Great Spirit, still walked among us, he gave Ho pi knowledge. He gave instructions and prophecies that along the way many things would come to pass. He pointed a path, a way to travel, like the narrow edge of a knife. Along the way we would face many evil obst acles. Obstacles which would lessen our spiritual energies and the will to go on, causing us to stray off the path. But, if we reached the end of the path without weak ening, we would be rewarded with a good, peaceful and everlasting life.

PARALLELS BETWEEN \"MASSAU'U\" AND THE \"MARRED\" SERVANT OF THE BIBLE AND BOOK OF MORMON Isaiah described the Lord's ministry and ho w he will bear our iniquities: \"He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied; by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he sh all bear their iniquities.\" Isaiah 53:11 There will be those who will not believe that the Lord speaks of himself as being the servant. The following scripture is given to show how the Lord explains a mystery in regard to his own testimony of himself: \"Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I BEAR RECORD OF MYSELF, yet my record is true; for I know whence I came , and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go... I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.\" John 8:14, 18 The Lord does \"bear witness of\" himself. He spoke of himself being sent as \"the servant.\" Jesus spoke of himself being the prophet like unto Mo ses and then stated: \"Verily, I say unto you, Yea; and all the prophets from Samuel, and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have testified of me. And behold ye are the children of the prophets; and ye are of the house of Israel; and ye are of the covenant which the Father made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed, shall all the kindreds of th e earth be blessed;\" 3 Nephi 9:62-63"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"If these, all the prophets from Samuel have spoken of Christ, they have not spoken of any man, but of the Lord.

Isaiah described the Lord's appearance: \"For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground; he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.\" Isaiah 53:2 Was Isaiah describing the Lord during his first appearance, his second appearance, or both? There are no scripture references of the Lord's face or body being disfigured. A crown of thorns was placed on his head, but his \"visage\" or face was not \"marred.\" He was scourged by the sold iers when they whipped him, but this does not mean that he was \"marred.\" Please remember that the Lord is the one prophesying concerning a future event. This prophecy concerns people being astonished at him due to his appearance or those acts which he will perform.

He sat down in front of the camera and talked non-stop for nearly two hours with such intensity and depth of understanding about the prophetic traditions of a diverse group of cultures that I was blown away. I realized that this interview should be the basis for a program all by itself. An Excerpt from the Program (Louis talking): If one sets aside the root prejudice that th ere is no divine revelation outside of the Jewish, Islamic, Christian tradition, and just looks at these other prophesies around the world, you'll find that th ey are strikingly similar. They are not just similar; it's a matter of si x of one, one half dozen of another. They are different nomenclatures, different descript ions, of the exact same events. What's different is the source here in this hemis phere may be called Massau, may be called the Peacemaker, may be called Mahayo, may be called Wakantaka, may be called different names, but the prophesies th emselves are strikingly identical. How far back they date can't be answered, bu t I don't think that's critical right now to know exactly how old they are. What 's critical is whether or not certain prophecies transmitted through the Nati ve American peoples have indeed been fulfilled, and I think unfortunately for us white folk and the world at large, all too many of these prophecies have been fulfi lled and therefore we're in a great deal of trouble. Our problem is that we don't want to take seriously the idea of prophecy in general. We don't believe these things are possible, although our physics are becoming more subtle, more mystical, and the idea of being able to maybe look backwards, forwards, and sideways in time is a lot less exotic an idea than it was until recently, by and large, we are not amenable to th e idea that the future can be foreseen in great detail. We also have the mistaken idea that just because it can be foreseen, that therefore the future is determined. It's not determined . Even though something is foreseen as a likelihood, events, contingenc ies, influences, desires, the re's a whole subtle field of human interactions that can shape the w ay things go. That's not why prophecies come true: because they are foreseen and foretold. Prophecies come true, if they do, because people don't do what it takes to avert them."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" We are meant to be unity.

SECURIT Y PRE CAUTIONS -- FR OM A FRIEND WHO KNOW S This is the red cross site for e mergency preparation:"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"http://www.redcross.org/services/dis aster/keepsafe/unexpected.html As an Emergency Manager with the U. S. Government, I have privileged information to the current events and th ose events that may happen in the near future. At this time, I want to take this opportunity to give you some general advice for survival if a terrorist act hits very close to home that could potentially incapacitate you. Here are some suggestions to be prepared: - Treat this situation as if it were a major earthquake. - If terrorism strikes in your state or ev en region, cellular phone systems will go out due to the overloading of the system and th e resulted crash of the network. Also your regular phones may be disrupted and th e state of emergency may result in 1/3 of your region's lines being turned off for pe riods of time so that the system doesn't overload. This is similar to rotating bl ackouts, only on the phone lines. Thus, develop a plan for you and your family memb ers so that you can either meet or be assured they will know how to regain contact with you. Also consider that if family members work or frequently travel to another city, roads may be blocked or unsafe to travel. Thus, arrange for those members away from the general home area to divert to a close friend's house in the city they frequent. Have them stay there until the \"all clear\" is given. You (and they) will be more assured of their safety. Have back up friends, too. Consider you will not be able to communicate with them for at least four to 24 hours - again, AT LEAST. - Ensure that you frequently refuel your vehi cles and that they are always full with gasoline. Those of you who frequently let your car go below 1/2 tank -- that may not get you home if stuck in local traffic. The last thing you want is to run out of gas. Remember, gas stations need electricity to run and in a terrorist situation, they may be ordered to shut down - even if there is electricity available. - ALWAYS carry cash and lower dollar bi lls. In a situation with communications failure, no store can process credit card / ATM transactions because these require phone lines. If you frequently forget to keep cash on you, have $40 in loose bills stored in a secret spot in your car that you use the most. This way, if you get caught on the road without cash, you have that secret stash. - Keep enough water on hand for ONE WEEK. Freshly bottled water. This is because our municipal water systems ARE at risk. One week will be sufficient for trucked water to make it in. The traditional three days is too short. - Have your pantry's STOCKED with food for one week, too. This should be food that is very simple to make. You should also have enough packaged food for a few days that require no cooking, should the electric systems be taken out."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"- It is a good idea to have a portable emergency kit in a large duffle bag containing the above items, should you (God forbid) ever need to be evacuated. This way, you can grab the (ONE) bag and go. Essential items should include medicines (for one week's supply), toilet paper, toothbrushes and paste, hand sanitizer, water / food, flashlights, portable radios with plenty of batteries, pen and paper, whistle, rope, duct tape, blankets, general toiletries, and anything else you feel to sustain you for ONE WEEK. Believe it or not, this can all fit into one large duffle bag for a regular sized family. Your life is the value, not material possessions. - Pets. Make sure you have the appropriate carriers for your pets and plan for extra water and food for them. It is a good idea to buy a small bag of food for them and store it with that emergency duffle bag. Also store leashes / collars, and extra water. Do NOT leave pets unattended. In emergency situations, they know something is wrong and get scared easily and may try to even run away. Be mindful of this. - In extreme cases, the Red Cross and local governments utilize Amateur Radio as a way to pass welfare traffic. Today's terrorist acts in NYC left Amateur Radio as the ONLY means of communications in or out of the city. The cities 9-1-1dispatch center was on the 12th floor of one of the to wers. That went down and so did their 9- 1-1 system for the whole city. If you evacuate, it is best to go to the Red Cross and have HAM radio pass welfare traffic to your loved ones across the country. - If you are home when a situation occurs, STAY THERE. DO NOT go out and drive around or wander. Subsequent events can immobilize you away from home and create undue worrying from your fami ly. Doing this also hampers emergency efforts and obstructs life saving efforts. - STAY OFF THE PHONE. Calling everyone in the world ties up the phone system and obstructs emergency services. It is best to CALL ONE part y out of state and have them contact everyone else to let them know you are okay. - The notion of this can't happen here was proved wrong. It can and will happen anywhere. Report suspicious circumstan ces to law enforcement immediately. Let them determine the severity of the situatio n. If government says get out or to watch out for certain places, don't take it light ly. THIS IS REAL. Consider that nothing happened to the west coast today and there are two very large population centers in California. If you think there are no terrori sts in California: WRONG. I can't say anything further on this without compromising confidentiality, but you get the point. - DON'T PANIC. Just be mindf ul of the circumstances. Just be prepared if it ever hits close to your home. Chances are it won't, but possibilities are endless. Pull together and defend our country and support government. This is a time where we need to unify as a nation more than ever. Certainly hope the above tips have made you aware of how to begin to take care of yourself and prepare before an emergency.

WHAT THE CREATOR TOLD ME TO TELL YOU ABOUT By Blueotter 13 years before my first wife Joanne’s passin g, in the spring of that year of 1982, I was told in my sleep, just before I woke in the morning, “An attempt will be made on the life of your wife during the dark of the moon.” We checked the calendar, because we thought something bad might happen to her the next weekend, but nothing unusual happened. Within two weeks, it was discovered that she had breast cancer. Her right breast was removed i mmediately, and life went on. In 1993, the other breast had to be removed and life went on for a while. Then, in late 1994, Joanne became more ill, and then in early 1995, it was discovered that she had terminal cancer of the liver and bones. Joanne passed on April 29, 1995. 10 days after her passing, I remembered the dream fr om 13 years previous, and it occurred to me to check the calenda r. Sure enough, she had passed away right in the middle of a “dark of the moon” phase. At that poin t, whoever was giving me information in my sleep had my attention! I first heard while “the voice” while I was awake back in 1990. A friend of ours had been packing church meetinghouse in ou r area...and telling people how to pray and actually get answers! The trick is, you mu st pray, and then stay awake and wait for an answer. The mind must be relaxed, which takes some time... sometimes hours. Remember, Jesus said, \"My sheep know my voice.\" I wanted some answers from God, and I was insistent! I told God that I was going to ask 16 times if necessary and that I wanted some answers! The first question I asked was, “What event will force the Mormon people to flee to the closest bridge on the Colorado River,” which is an old Mormon prophesy. I did not have to wait long. My body seemed to vibrate, and an inner voice simply said:”The Flood.” I then asked who would come to lead us. I was then told, “Phillip.’ That made no sense to me at that moment. I called an acquaintance, Joe Samson, who was a researcher into an old Egyptian symbology, who had written the book, “Wr itten by the Finger of God.” I had attended a lecture, where Joe had explained what certain ancient words meant, when encoded. “Phi” meant, “A ruler whose right it is to rule.” Joe said the “L” or “LL” (depending on how Philip / Phillip is spelled) represented the Pharaoh’s “flail,” which meant that this future ruler would come with a double scourge.” He said that “ip” in Greek, was the same as “zipzee” in Mayan, which meant “a doubling.” So Phillip meant, he explained, “A ruler... whose right it was to rule... who would come with a scourge... and woul d sit on two thrones.” I was astonished, because scripture prophesies that when Go d returns to Earth, he will sit on the thrones of both Joseph and David."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Source: Joe Sampson; Written by the Finger of God: Decoding Ancient Languages: A Testimony of Joseph Smith's Translations ; Wellspring Publishing and Distributing, P.O. Box 1113, Sandy, UT 84091; 1993; ISBN 1-884312-05-5. So, I was certainly accustomed to “the voice” telling me things from time to time. In 1993, during a period of searching for more “answers,” that same voice awoke me one morning, telling me, “You will hear di fferent things, and you may even hear brighter promises, but don ’t worry, just follow me.” I was told in my sleep in early 1998 that the year 2005 would experience weather that would be so bad that it would shut down most computers on the planet. The following August of 1998, I was told in a dream \"You have seven years.\" When I woke up, I was quite shook up and fearful, and exasperated, because of the scanty information that was provided by whoever wa s speaking to me. So, I decided to ask whom it was that was speaking to me in my sleep to reveal his identity. Two weeks later, I heard the same powerful but calm voice say, very softly, \"I am...” and then very firmly, “I AM!\" From that point forward, I had no problem dealing with the source of my inspiration because I knew the voice speaking to me. I then got to thinking, “Why 2005?” After a wh ile I realized that there was a 7-year period between 2005 and 2012. I then remembered being told by someone that seven years is known as a “testing” period. Both the Mayan and Cherokee calendars supposedly end in December of 2012. In August of 2000, I was told, “‘The Three’ h ave been trying to come for the last 400 years, but have been unable to come beca use ‘the people’ were not ready. They are coming in 4 years, so get ready!” I almost immediately figured out that “the three” He was speaking of might just be “The Three” that appeared to Abraham in the book of Genesis, Massau and his 2 helpers that had appeared to the Hopi, the “Three Nephites” of Book of Mormon legend, and “the 3” that appeared to Handsome Lake and had delivered the “Good News” religion.

S ome of you may remember great-g randma putting a silver dollar in the milk to keep it from spoiling"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"as it sat on the back porch in the summertime. From the late 1800s until 1938, Colloidal Silver was in common use in America. Before there were man-made antibiotics available, Colloidal Silver was successfully used to treat a variety of diseases without harm to the liver and kidne ys that man-made antibiotics bring. In fact, Colloidal Silver is non -toxic to mammals, reptiles, pl ants and all living things with more than one cell. The presence of Colloidal Silver near a viru s, fungus, bacteria or any single-celled disease-causing pathogen cripples its oxygen- metabolizing-enzyme. It suffocates and dies in a few minutes and is cleared out of the body by the immune, lymphatic, and eliminatory systems. While man-made antibiotics destroy a variety of enzymes throughout the body and kill off the friendly bacteria in the intestinal tract, Colloidal Silver leaves the enzymes of tissue-type cells unaffected. In the past, the major set-back of using silv er as an antibiotic was its high price, leaving it available only to heads of state, royalty and those with economic power. But today, improvements in the method of production allow liquid Colloidal Silver to be marketed at a fracti on of its previous cost. Colloidal Silver is \"pure silver divided into atoms or micro-clusters of fewer than 15 atoms each and given a positive electric ch arge so that it will float throughout pure water, making what is called a Colloi dal Suspension--one substance, a solid, suspended in another substance, liquid.\" Th is technology allows the product to be more affordable today. Although each situation and each person's metabolism is different, Colloidal Silver's antibiotic, anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties have been successfully used in treating over 650 diseases. Here is a partial list: abrasions, acne, allergies, athlete's foot, blood parasites, burns, Candida, chroni c fatigue, colds / flu, dandruff, herpes, infection, inflammation, L upus, Lyme's Disease, parasi tic infections, pneumonia, psoriasis, staph and strep infections, tonsil litis, all forms of virus, warts and yeast infections. What makes Colloidal Silver so unique is th at it is non-toxic, safe during pregnancy, and non-allergenic, and no germ has been able to mutate and prevent its own destruction by silver in th e several thousand years of opportunity. Therefore, no tolerance to Colloidal Silver has been rep orted, unlike regular antibiotics. There also has not been any pharmaceutical dr ug interaction reported. The chemical nature of silver is such that inside the bo dy, it forms no compounds that are toxic. For some people, using Colloidal Silver is like having a second immune system, both to prevent and to treat infections and cell damage. Another great benefit of Colloid al Silver is that it is one of the best water purifiers available.

The bew ildering problem, though, is that since"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"garden seeds are perishable commodities, wh en is the wisest time to purchase them. If you buy too soon, the seeds may no longer be viable by the time you plant them in the ground. If you postpone your purchase until the time of need cascades in upon you and you are ready to plant, the seeds you want may not be available, or you may be competing with too many other despera te people for limited resources, or you may not then have the funds to meet in flated, exorbitant prices. The seeds you purchase from Seeds for Survival provi de the solution to this dilemma. The collection of vegetables offered in our catalog have been carefully selected for their dependability, productivity, or prolonge d storage characteristics and will be of interest to all those seekin g greater independence from the grocery store. A great deal of thought has gone into the sizing of our individual seed packets, which usually contain more seed than sold by other compan ies, so as to meet the needs of growers who may be facing hard times and require an abundant harvest. All seeds sold by Seeds for Survival are from open-pollinated plants rather than hybrids meaning that the grower can gather the seeds fr om the harvest and replant them the following season with the assurance that they will breed true and produce plants with identical characteristic s to their parent stock. This liberates the grower from annual purchases of hybrid seeds and depe ndence on seed companies for their food source.“ \"Seeds for Survival grew out of two decade s of research, gardening experience, and a growing concern for the dwindling availability of non-hybrid vegetable varieties and the consequent loss of genetic div ersity in humanity's seed supply. In the process of creating and maintaining a la rge inventory of seeds from endangered food crops, the need became apparent fo r finding an inexpensive but effective method of long-term storage that woul d extend the time between plantings and renewal of seed stock. The process we adopted has proven extremely effective. During the 1999 growing season, our greenhouse was alive with, among other things, spinach, lettuce, peas, beans, sweet peppers, watermelon, and corn all grown from seeds packaged 12 years ago.\" From the seeds for survival website: The technique we use for preparing our s eeds is not new and has been used by professional seedsavers for many years to perpetuate their large seed collections. Since seeds are living things, they are in continual interaction with their environment. By controlling the environment in which a seed is maintained, both its viability and its vigor, the seed's ability to germinate rapidly with a normal growth rate and to be disease-resistant, can be influenced. Under normal conditions the two most important factors influencing seed lo ngevity is the storage temperature and the relative humidity of the air in which the s eed is maintained. To a large degree it is these two factors which determine the internal moisture content of the seed and, by consequence, the rate of its metabolic proce sses. The conclusion of all this is simple: the cooler and dryer the storage environment, the longer the seed life. Thus, the rule of thumb for good storage conditions has always been that the sum of the relative"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"humidity of the air in which the seed is kept plus the degrees Fahrenheit of the temperature should not exceed 100. Once thes e conditions are met, for every further reduction of ten degrees in temperature, th e storage life of the seed is doubled. Current advances in technology have eased the burden somewhat of having to create and maintain an ideal external storage environment. Under normal conditions, each type of vegetable seed ha s a natural moisture content measured as a percent of the total contents of the seed. Through a process that does not involve heating or exposing the seed to chemical influences, the moistu re from the interior of the seed can be drawn out slowing its physiology and extending its life. Via this method, for every decrease of 1% in mois ture content, a seed's storage life is doubled. The seeds sold by Seeds for Survival, on average, have had their moisture content reduced by 3% thereby, at a minimum, tripling the seed's natural life span. Once our seeds have been dried, they are immediately packaged in custom-made pouches that create a controlled environment that protects them from light, air, and moisture. They are then stored in a cool environment until shipping. It is recommended that you store the s eeds you purchase in as cool a place as possible where the temperature does not fluc tuate greatly. A refrigerator would be ideal. A cool basement, closet, or root cellar would all be suitable. It is recommended that you do not freeze your seeds. Some ty pes of seeds still may have a moisture content greater than 8% and freezing these seeds will rupture their cell walls and destroy them. When contemplating a purchase of seeds for long-term storage, it must be kept in mind that seeds are living things and canno t be stored indefinitely. Given enough time, your seeds will lose their vigor and thei r capacity to germinate. If you foresee a time when your survival may depend on your seed collection, it is imperative that you monitor your seeds by conducting p eriodic germination tests on some representative packets of your collection to determine the percentage of still viable seed. Only by such oversight can you be fully confident that the seeds you have stored will be able to sustain you when calle d upon to do so. It is suggested that you purchase extra packets of a few types of seeds on which to conduct these germination tests. Tests for germination are easy to conduct. Cu t the top off of one of our seed packets and remove a sample of seeds, usua lly 20, 25, or 50. Immediately reseal the remaining seeds by running a hot iron over the top of the packet for a few seconds until the two sides firmly adhere. The seed sample you sel ected can then be planted in a seed flat. As an alternative, you can place the seeds between two pieces of blotter paper or heavy paper towels that have been thoroughly moistened with warm water. The seeds should then be pl aced someplace where they will be exposed to a constant minimum temperature of 75 de grees Fahrenheit and not be allowed to dry out. Most varieties of seeds will begi n to germinate within seven days. Due to variability, germination of th e entire sample may not be complete until the end of"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"three to four weeks. By comparing the num ber of seeds that germinated with the total number of seeds planted in the samp le, you can determine the percentage of seeds that are likely to germ inate when eventually planted. When you are ready to start planting your garden, please bear in mind that to germinate properly and regain their vigor, the seeds have to reabsorb sufficient moisture to ease them out of their dormant state. This can be accomplished by removing the seeds from the package and leaving them exposed to the air for a minimum of 24 hours prior to planting. By this, they will reabsorb the moisture that was removed prior to packaging and be at their optimum for germination. Further, make sure that the seeds are thoroughly watered and that the growing medium remains moist until ge rmination has begun. IT IS ESSENTIAL that before purchasin g seeds from Seeds for Survival you carefully review the chart on the natural li fe span of seeds at the bottom of this page. Familiarize yourself with the fact that all seeds are not alike and that consequently the shelf life of different varie ties of seeds will vary. For instance, with no special treatment or packaging, seeds fr om onions and parsnips usually remain viable for only 1 to 2 years while cucumber seeds will remain viable for 6 or more years. Although we can dramatically prolong these natural life spans through proper drying and packaging, it is still a fact of life that the onion seeds you have in storage will have to be replaced so oner than your cucumber seeds. We conservatively estimate that the seeds we sell will remain viable for three times their natural life span. As a precaut ion assume that if kept longer, the percentage of seeds germinating will begin to decrease and the vi gor of these seeds will begin to decline. Thus, if you are counting on your seeds for your survival, you must monitor sample packages of your seeds by performing periodic germination tests. As an alternative, it is recommended that periodically you plant out your seeds in the garden and replenish your stock of stored seeds that you are saving for a rainy day. Careful planning guarantees success. Kn ow what vegetables you want and the quantities that will meet your needs, and realize that over time some seeds with normally short life spans will have to peri odically be replenished to keep your seed collection in a state of readiness. At Seeds for Survival, we take seriously th e fact that our customers may some day stake their lives on the seeds they purchas e from us. With this in mind, it often appears unconscionable what our competitor s are selling. Many companies, with no experience in agriculture, are jumping into the market on the Y2K craze to make a quick buck and are offering seeds of questionable quality. Not a single company offering seeds for storage other than Seed s for Survival has been working with seeds long enough to have tested their preserv ation techniques and th e longevity of their seeds. From the seeds for survival website:"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"When purchasing seeds to put away for a time of need, please be cautious of the following seed offers: 1) Some companies vacuum pack their seeds in #10 cans and claim that such packaging is an effective method of preserving seeds and extending their storage life. Be advised that living, respiring seeds, when maintained in an airless environment, can lose their viability and die. 2) One competitor is offering seeds package d in plastic conferring the benefit to the purchaser of being able to examine the contents of the packet. Most plastics, however, are not 100% airtight and allow the passage of air and moisture into and out of the seed environment. Consequently, these seeds would not be expected to survive beyond their normal life span. 3) The seed preservation technique of some companies consists simply of adding silica gel to the packaging so as to prevent moisture from entering the seed environment. Although moisture protection is essential for prolonged storage life, this in itself will not extend the natural longevity of seeds. 4) These same companies promise a remar kable harvest from the 10, 25, or even 100 packets of seeds they sell in a complete package deal, but they give you no seed count for each individual vegetable variety. If you are a grower wi th experience, you know that 100 pea or corn seeds, though soun ding like a lot, is a pittance if you have to live off what you grow, and who needs 100 collard seeds?
