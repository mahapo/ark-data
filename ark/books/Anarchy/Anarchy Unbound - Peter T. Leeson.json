Their central argument is simple: anarchyworks better than you think.My thesis sets a low argumentative bar. If you're like most people, you don'tthink anarchy works at all. Such readers are in good company. One of the mostimportant figures in the history of social thought, Thomas Hobbes, shared thatthinking.In 1651 Hobbes famously described life in anarchy as “solitary, poor, nasty,brutish, and short.” His reasoning is familiar. In anarchy, property isunprotected: there's nothing to prevent the strong from plundering the weak, theunscrupulous from bamboozling the unwitting, and the dishonest from defraudingthe honest. There's no social cooperation, only social conflict, nocivilization, only chaos.Hobbes's path out of this anarchic jungle was government. By making andenforcing rules that protect individuals’ property, he argued, government willcreate social harmony. Indeed, government will create society.Hobbes was wrong – on both counts. Individuals have secured property protectionand social cooperation without government and still do. Moreover, in much of theworld, government has proved to be the greatest depredator of property rights,creator of conflict, and instigator of chaos, rather than an innocuous antidoteto anarchic afflictions.Governance – social rules that protect individuals’ property and institutions oftheir enforcement – doesn't require government, which is but one means ofsupplying governance. Hobbes overlooked the possibility of self-governance:privately created social rules and institutions of their enforcement. He alsounderestimated the possibility of truly horrible governments. It's thereforeunsurprising that he saw anarchy as anathema to society and government as itssavior.Some readers may not be quite so optimistic about government, or quite sopessimistic about anarchy, as Hobbes was. Today it's widely acknowledged thatmany governments fail to live up to what their advocates hope for. Indeed, somegovernments do far worse than that. Instead of promoting cooperation,governments in the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, and North Korea, to name but afew, severely undermined cooperation in their societies (and in the case ofNorth Korea still do), with devastating consequences. Because of this, you maybe (or at least should be) less sanguine about the possibility of government associety's savior than Hobbes's rhetoric suggests.Today it's also acknowledged that at least some social interactions can be, andare, carried off cooperatively without government's assistance. Hobbes'scharacterization of anarchy expresses basic “prisoners’ dilemma” logic. Awell-known result of that logic is that mutual noncooperation is the unique Nashequilibrium when such games are played but once. An equally well-known result isthe possibility of cooperative equilibria when they're played infinitely orterminate with some constant known probability.This “folk theorem” result of iterated noncooperative games supplies a readymechanism of self-governance: the discipline of continuous dealings. Individualsmay adopt strategies in their interactions with others whereby they refuse tointeract with uncooperative persons in the future, cutting them off from thegains of additional interactions. By penalizing uncooperative behavior, suchstrategies can induce cooperation. If we consider more than two persons,reputations become possible, further strengthening the penalty for uncooperativebehavior. Now, by having developed a negative reputation, uncooperative personsmay lose the gains from interacting even with persons toward whom they haven'tbehaved uncooperatively.Hobbes's reasoning sets the bar required to make the argument that anarchy worksbetter than you think on the floor. Reasoning about anarchy and government thatincorporates the foregoing considerations sets that bar higher, but only a fewinches so. Even persons who recognize self-governance's existence quickly followtheir recognition with the caveat that self-governance's scope of effectiveapplication is severely limited. And even persons who acknowledge that somegovernments are truly horrendous are still sure that any government is betterthan none at all.This book challenges the conventional wisdom that sees successfulself-governance's range as severely limited. It finds private social order whereconventional wisdom says we shouldn't. Roughly speaking, that's where thediscipline of continuous dealings has difficulty securing cooperation by itself,such as when populations are large or diverse, when interactions aren't repeatedor persons are impatient, and when violence is possible or individuals aredevoted to plunder as a way of life.Persons who find themselves in anarchy are considerably more creative in findingsolutions to their problems than the academics who study them. Unlike academics,these persons reap large rewards if they solve those problems and suffer largepenalties if they don't. They must live (or die) with the consequences of eitherfloundering in the face of, or overcoming, the obstacles that stand in the wayof their ability to realize the gains of social cooperation without government.Given such powerful incentives, it would be surprising if persons in anarchy didnot develop effective mechanisms of self-governance in a wide variety ofdifficult circumstances, including those where the discipline of continuousdealings alone is insufficient. And, as this book evidences, they do.Those mechanisms take several forms. Some, such as those that leverage thediscipline of continuous dealings, enforce social rules internally – throughpunishments that persons who are themselves parties to the relevant interactionsthreaten. Others, such as private professional judges, enforce social rulesexternally – through punishments that third parties to the relevant interactionsthreaten instead. Some mechanisms of self-governance enforce social rules withthreats of peaceful punishments, such as shaming. Others enforce social ruleswith threats of violent ones, such as blood feuding. The essays in this bookconsider mechanisms of self-governance that rely on both internal and externalenforcement, as well as those that rely on both peaceful and violentpunishments.This book also challenges the conventional wisdom according to whichself-governance always performs worse than government. There are some conditionsunder which even an ideal government – the imaginary sort that has neverexisted, but most people imagine anyway – turns out to be less sensible than nogovernment at all. More important, by understating the degree of socialcooperation that self-governance can secure, and overstating the degree ofsocial cooperation that many actual governments do secure, conventional wisdomignores the possibility that citizens living under ultra-predatory anddysfunctional governments might fare better under anarchy. As this book alsoevidences, in one case at least, this possibility is almost certainly a reality.A mechanism of self-governance can be said to “work” if it tolerably solves theproblem that persons in anarchy rely on it to address. None of the mechanisms Iconsider solve the problems they address perfectly. Then again, neither wouldany mechanism of governance, including government.Anarchy can be said to “work better than you think” if the mechanisms ofself-governance that undergird it work in circumstances where you thoughtself-governance couldn't. This book considers several such circumstances. Part I[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_008.html#filepos43978] contains essaysthat address self-governance when populations are socially diverse. Part II[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_011.html#filepos182009] contains essaysthat address self-governance when individuals face the specter of physicalviolence. Part III[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_014.html#filepos345761] contains essaysthat address self-governance in societies composed exclusively of “bad apples” –persons whose way of living is devoted to theft and murder.Each of these circumstances poses a different obstacle for the discipline ofcontinuous dealings in securing self-governance. To work well, and some wouldargue to work at all, in addition to requiring repeated interaction, thediscipline of continuous dealings requires small and socially homogeneouspopulations, populations whose members don't confront the prospect of violence,and populations whose members don't discount the future too heavily. The essaysin Parts I [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_008.html#filepos43978]–III[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_014.html#filepos345761] analyze cases ofsuccessful self-governance despite deviations from these conditions, and thusmechanisms of self-governance that go beyond the discipline of continuousdealings alone.Anarchy can also be said to work better than you think when (assuming you didn'tbelieve as much already) a society whose governance is based on such mechanismsproduces higher welfare than it could enjoy under its feasible governmentalternative. The essays in Part IV[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_017.html#filepos515731] considerself-governance in this vein.The key to finding such a self-governance “unicorn” is to compare a society witha recent experience under anarchy to the same society under the government itactually had before or after moving to anarchy – or, somewhat more difficultly,if that society hasn't had a recent experience under anarchy, to compare thatsociety's likely experience under anarchy to its experience under the governmentit's currently under. This kind of comparison forces one to restrict hisattention to relevant governance alternatives – to the kind of anarchy andgovernment actually available to some society – and precludes the comparison ofirrelevant governance alternatives, such as poorly functioning anarchy andexceptionally high-functioning government, which is the kind of comparison mostpeople are prone to make. The self-governing society that outperforms thestate-governed one is only impossible to find if one is simultaneouslypessimistic about anarchy in some society and optimistic about government inthat same society, which, ordinarily, he probably shouldn't be given that thesame historical constraints that limit the potential effectiveness of one kindof governance arrangement are likely to limit the potential effectiveness ofother kinds.Anarchy working better than you think does not mean that the mechanisms ofself-governance I discuss always, or even often, work better at solving theproblems they address than some kind of government could – especially if thatgovernment is the rare, extremely well-functioning kind most people pretend isthe rule instead of the exception. I will argue that in some cases thosemechanisms can work better than government – especially if one compares theirperformance to the comparatively common, extremely poorly functioning kind mostpeople pretend is the exception instead of the rule. But my argument doesn'timply that any anarchy is superior to any government one could conceive of. Nordoes anarchy's superiority in a particular case necessarily generalize.So much for what I mean (and don't mean) by anarchy working better than youthink. What do I mean by “anarchy”? I mean government's absence, of course. Andby “government” I mean…Well, here things become a bit more complicated.It's tempting to define government following Max Weber's (1919[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos854870]) classiccharacterization: as a territorial monopoly on violence – on social rulecreation and enforcement. As a rule, this is the conception of government thisbook's essays have in mind. But there are several problems with this conceptionthat compel me in at least two essays to conceive of government, and thusanarchy, somewhat differently.If we follow Weber, government's presence or absence depends on what oneconsiders the relevant territory. If we define that territory narrowly enough,every authority, even private ones we wouldn't normally call by the name, is agovernment. For example, if we call my condominium building the relevantterritory, my homeowner's association could be considered a government, for italone has the authority to make and enforce social rules regulating activity inthe condo. Under a sufficiently narrow territorial definition, government iseverywhere. In contrast, if we define the relevant territory broadly enough –say, the world – the reverse is true. The absence of a global government meanscountries exist vis-à-vis one another as individuals would in Hobbes's state ofnature. Now government is nowhere.This feature of the Weberian conception of government poses a potential problem,but not an insurmountable one. One simply needs to be clear about scope of theterritory he's considering and to make an argument about why that territory isthe relevant one for the purpose at hand. For example, to examine the politicaleconomy of Arlington, Virginia, where my condominium building is located, Ithink everyone would agree the relevant territory is Arlington, Virginia, ratherthan my condominium building. In contrast, to examine the political economy ofinternational relations, I think everyone would agree the world, or some otherregion encompassing multiple countries, is the relevant territory rather thanone country in particular. Reasonable persons could disagree in specific casesabout whether the appropriate territorial unit had been selected for someanalysis. But, at least in principle, we could have a clear, common definitionof where we have government and where we don't.The more serious difficulty in trying to apply consistently a Weberianconception of government – and the one of much more importance for this book –is illustrated by the following example. Suppose that for some purpose underconsideration everyone agrees that some small isolated community is the relevantterritory of analysis. Suppose further that every person in this community hasexplicitly and voluntarily agreed that a single third party's decisions shallgovern them, say the community elder's, enforced with threats of violenceexclusively by his command. Is the elder this community has decided shall governit a government? He has a monopoly on social rule creation and enforcement inthe territory in question. A Weberian conception, then, would seem to suggest heis.Yet I’m reluctant to call him a “government.” And I suspect I’m not alone. Thereason for my discomfort with the Weberian conclusion here is that the personsthis third party governs have unanimously consented to it as their governanceagency. It seems just as sensible to characterize this community's governancearrangement as a private club as it does to characterize it as a government. Butour intuition suggests to us that there's an important difference between clubsand governments.Because the possibility of explicit unanimous consent seems to be the source ofuneasiness with the Weberian conception in such cases, it's natural to seek amodified conception of government, and thus anarchy, that considers not onlywhether a governance authority or arrangement has a territorial monopoly, butalso whether the persons it governs have unanimously and voluntarily consentedto be governed by it. Under this conception, coercion at the level of whether ornot you will be bound by a governing authority's decisions, in addition to aterritorial monopoly, is what makes for a government.A monopoly governing agency that compels persons to abide by the social rules itcreates, but which all those persons haven't explicitly consented to be governedby, is a government. In contrast, a governance agency, even if it's the soleagency in a territory that creates and enforces social rules, and even if itenforces those rules violently, is an example of self-governance provided thatevery person it governs has previously and explicitly consented to as much.Oddly, in this conception of government, if Hobbes's “government” actuallyemerged in the way that he and other social contractarians hypothesize – throughthe unanimous consent of the people it governs – it would not be a government.It would be an example of self-governance.Unfortunately, what seems like a natural way to modify the Weberian conceptionof government turns out to be just as problematic as the unmodified conception,but in a different way. Consider an isolated community in which the only socialrules that exist are norms – unwritten property customs that evolved organicallyover centuries – and the only means of enforcing those rules is a norm ofstoning, which community members resort to when there's consensus that animportant rule has been broken. The persons who populate this community havenever explicitly consented to be governed by the set of norms that are the onlysource of rules that regulate their behavior, and do so violently at that.Are these persons living under a government? I think most everyone would answerno. Yet because the rule and enforcement norms that provide governance in thiscommunity haven't received explicit unanimous consent, the modified conceptionof government described in the preceding paragraph would seem to suggest theyare.If this norm-based governance, which is decentralized and unconsciously created,doesn't seem to capture what we mean by a “monopoly authority” (even though it'sthe only source of social rule creation and enforcement that exists and,moreover, that enforcement is violent), consider another example. Suppose anorganized crime family uses threats of violence to run its neighborhood in somecountry where a state officially exists but pays scant attention to its duties,leaving the neighborhood's inhabitants to their own devices. Is the crime familya government?While the modified conception of government described in the preceding paragraphsuggests it is, I don't think most readers would be prepared to call it one. Onthe contrary, I suspect most readers would say the crime family is a result ofgovernment's absence. They would characterize the crime family as a consequenceof anarchy. And I would agree.1Yet another possible approach to identifying government is to appeal to thenotion of “exit costs.” But this approach fails to deliver an unambiguousdefinition of government for similar reasons. Exit costs are, quite literally,the costs of exiting life under one governance arrangement to live life underanother. The trouble with using exit costs to define government is that it'scostly to exit any governance arrangement unless there are an infinite number ofsuch arrangements in a territory, which there never are.Because government monopolizes governance in some territory, exit costs undergovernment will very likely be higher than under self-governance, which, atleast in principle, doesn't preclude the possibility of multiple governancearrangements operating in the same territory. But this difference doesn't get usfar. What is the “cutoff cost” – the exit cost above which we definitively havegovernment and below which we definitively have anarchy – that unambiguouslydefines government? There isn't one. And unlike when one must make an argumentfor the relevant territory of analysis to define government, where there willordinarily be a “natural” or “obvious” reason for selecting one territory overanother that everyone can assent to, it's hard to see on what grounds one couldmake a persuasive argument that the cutoff cost they have chosen is anythingother than arbitrary. Our intuition about the exit cost that makes forgovernment is weak, as is the extent to which we share that intuition.Equally important, one can imagine a self-governance arrangement that is moreexpensive to exit than government. A government that monopolizes governance in aterritory that's much smaller than the territory governed exclusively by, say, aset of norms, or even a unanimously selected third party, is cheaper to exitthan these alternative governance arrangements. Yet it would be strange if asystem of norms or a unanimously selected third party metamorphosed into agovernment because it happened to govern a larger territory. And no reasonableperson would claim that it did.Hopefully it's clear now why defining government precisely is problematic. Inlight of this, unsatisfying though it may be, this book's essays sometimesconceive of government, and thus anarchy, with the Weberian conception in mind,and sometimes with the modified, coercion-inclusive conception in mind instead.I’m unwilling to call the governance system that prevailed on pirate ships – thesubject of one of the essays in Part III[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_014.html#filepos345761] – government,even though this system constituted a monopoly on violence on each pirate ship,because the pirates it governed explicitly and unanimously consented to thatsystem. At the same time I’m unwilling to call the governance system thatprevails in Somalia – the subject of one of the essays in Part IV[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_017.html#filepos515731] – government,even though this system governs many persons who never consented to be governedby it and does so partly with threats of violence, because that system reflectsthe absence of what every reasonable person calls government rather thangovernment's presence.My approach to identifying government is therefore like Justice Potter Stewart'sapproach to identifying pornography: you know it when you see it. Unlikeintuitions about exit costs, most people do seem to share strong intuitionsabout whether government governs some set of social relations or not. Thus our(or, at least, my) inability to define government in a fully satisfactory mannerin theory needn't prevent us from identifying government's presence or absencein practice. I realize this approach creates scope for disagreement aboutwhether we have government or anarchy in a particular instance. But I see noalternative approach that seems likely to produce less disagreement. Moreover, Ihope – and indeed suspect – that you will agree in each case I examine thatanarchy is in fact present in the sense I consider.Note that under either conception of government described earlier, anarchydoesn't preclude multiple governments’ presence, such as in internationalcontexts. The international arena encompasses interactions between multiplesovereigns and thus presents formally ungoverned interstices. There's nosupranational agency with monopoly power to create and enforce social rules thatcover multiple sovereigns. There are supranational organizations, such as theUnited Nations, as well as a large variety of multinational treaties forgoverning various interstate relationships. These organizations sometimesperform adjudication services for member countries and threaten punishments fornoncompliance. But members of such organizations and treaties are membersvoluntarily. Ultimately they abide by, or refuse to abide by, suchorganizations’ or treaties’ directives voluntarily as well. This doesn't meansupranational organizations’ directives aren't often enforced. But, ironically,given that such organizations are often justified by the need to remove theworld's governments from international anarchy, their enforcement power derivesfrom self-governing mechanisms, such as those rooted in the discipline ofcontinuous dealings, not from government.This book's method of analysis is decidedly economic. It uses rational choicetheory to understand the anarchic environments and mechanisms of self-governancethat individuals develop to cope with those environments. This isn't the onlymethod one could imagine using. But I’m an economist and, even for an economist,I believe strongly that the economic approach is by far the most productive.One recommending feature of the economic approach is its ability to supplyinsight into the underlying mechanisms that do or don't enable anarchy to workin particular cases.2 This emphasis on mechanisms permits me to move beyond meredescriptions of anarchy working in various circumstances toward a betterunderstanding of the logic underlying why it succeeds in those circumstances andprecisely how it manages to do so.My essays are in the form of what are sometimes called analytic narratives. Inthem, economic logic shapes and illuminates the data of the historical orcontemporary case under consideration. This approach necessarily involvesabstracting from much descriptive detail to make an intelligible analysispossible. At the same time it retains and brings to the foreground otherdescriptive detail that frames, and is equally important for makingintelligible, the case under consideration.As in my other work, the economic logic deployed here is overwhelmingly verbal.I hope this makes this book accessible to a wider audience. This is also themanner in which I “think economically” and thus the manner in which I write. Ipoint this out, first, with the aim of retaining non-economist readers, orothers more comfortable with nontechnical analyses, who might otherwise set thisbook aside now in the mistaken belief that a flurry of equations are to follow.I point this out, second, so that readers committed to the view that formalismis the only, or the only legitimate, way to say anything useful can set me asidenow and return to their mathematical exercises.This book's analyses are positive, not normative. They describe how the world is(or was), not how it should be. One could use my discussions of how the world isto support arguments about how it should be. And in this book's penultimatechapter I consider one such argument. That discussion is partly normative,however, so I have separated it from the positive analyses in the essays thatinform my normative claim.It's inevitable that some persons will be unable (or unwilling) to accept theclaim that the analyses in Chapters 2[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_009.html#filepos44303] through 9[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_019.html#filepos568048] are positive.They will jump from the fact that I’m challenging conventional wisdom aboutself-governance to the mistaken belief that the essays I use to do so arenormative. If you're one of these persons, go back and read the allegedlynormative essay(s) again. You will see that the discussion is in fact positive.If you don't see this, consult a dictionary for the definitions of “positive”and “normative.” If you still remain unconvinced, consider the possibility thatit's not me who has difficulty escaping normative thinking.A fundamental task of social science is to understand how individuals securesocial cooperation under the division of labor. Where government exists andfunctions well, developing such an understanding is relatively easy. Incontrast, as Hobbes's (mistaken) thinking about anarchy clearly attests, wheregovernment is absent or highly dysfunctional, doing so is much harder. Thechallenge this book puts to you is my attempt to contribute to our understandingof how individuals secure social cooperation in circumstances where the ideathat they could do so seems illusory. The invitation this book extends to you isto join me in exploring the possibility that it's not. 1 A closely related way of trying to negotiate this difficulty of the Weberianconception involves modifying government's definition with the word “legitimate”such that government becomes a “legitimate monopoly on force in a giventerritory” (indeed, Weber himself at times used “legitimate” as part ofgovernment's definition). Unfortunately, this modification fails in much the waythat, I have argued earlier, the coercion-inclusive conception of governmentfails. If “legitimate” is a normative statement about the moral right of amonopoly agency on force to govern a certain territory, there's the obviousproblem that individuals’ understandings about what's morally right aresubjective, precluding an objective definition of government. If instead“legitimate” is a positive statement about the fraction of a population governedby a monopoly agency on force that approves of this agency – that is, sees it aslegitimate, in which case calling government a “legitimized monopoly on force ina territory” would be more accurate – a different difficulty emerges. In thecase where every person approves of the monopoly, it's sensible to call themonopoly legitimate. But in this case we have a self-governing club, aspreviously described. In the case where there's anything short of unanimousapproval of the monopoly, we have ambiguity about whether the monopoly islegitimate and thus whether we have government. 2 On the importance of focusing on mechanisms of self-governance in discussionsof anarchy, see Boettke (2012[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos799903]a, 2012[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos800076]b) and Leeson(2012 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos826342]a)."},{"pageContent":"Part I Self-Governance and the Problem of Social Diversity"},{"pageContent":"2 Social Distance and Self-Enforcing Exchange*Mechanisms of self-governance grounded in the discipline of continuous dealingscome in two basic forms: bilateral-punishment strategies andmultilateral-punishment strategies. Bilateral-punishment strategies involve asingle person refusing to interact in the future with persons who cheated themin the past. They constitute “one-man boycotts.” Multilateral-punishmentstrategies involve multiple persons refusing to interact in the future withpersons who cheated them or others in the past. They constitute multi-personboycotts. Because they punish uncooperative behavior more severely,multilateral-punishment strategies supply the stronger threat to uncooperativebehavior. Thus, in principle, they're able to secure cooperation under a widervariety of circumstances.Consider two societies: one populated by highly patient individuals, the otherpopulated by highly impatient ones. Because highly patient individuals discountthe earnings from interacting in the future with others minimally, the threat oflosing the earnings from interacting in the future with even a single person ifthey cheat that person today may be enough to lead the former society's membersto behave cooperatively. For these individuals, the discounted value of therevenue lost from being unable to interact in the future with just one otherperson exceeds the one-shot payoff of behaving uncooperatively toward him.Bilateral punishment is fully effective here.This isn't so in the society of highly impatient individuals. Because theseindividuals discount the earnings from interacting in the future with otherssteeply, the threat of losing the earnings from interacting in the future witheven, say, 50 percent of other persons in their population may not be enough todeter them from behaving uncooperatively. For them, the discounted value of therevenue lost from being unable to interact in the future with half thepopulation is less than the one-shot payoff of behaving uncooperatively towardsomeone. Bilateral punishment, and even 50 percent-encompassing multilateralpunishment, is ineffective here.Imagine, however, that multilateral punishment was more encompassing. Suppose,for instance, that it was fully encompassing – that cheating one person involvedforegoing the earnings of interacting in the future with every person in thepopulation. Now the punishment for behaving uncooperatively would almostcertainly be severe enough to induce even persons in the highly impatientsociety to behave cooperatively. More effective multilateral punishment is moreencompassing multilateral punishment.The same point applies to a society composed of persons of varying degrees ofpatience, some of whom discount the future relatively little and some of whom doso a lot. Bilateral or less encompassing multilateral punishment will preventuncooperative behavior by the more patient members of such a society. But moreencompassing multilateral punishment is needed to prevent uncooperative behaviorby less patient members. The implication is the same: to be more effective,multilateral punishment must be more encompassing.What, then, determines how encompassing multilateral punishment is? The firstimportant factor is the ease with which information about the history ofindividuals’ conduct – about whether individuals have behaved cooperatively oruncooperatively in the past – reaches their population's other members. Wheresuch information flows with less difficulty, a higher proportion of thepopulation knows who to punish. The second important factor is the extent towhich members of the population share ideas about what kinds of behaviors areuncooperative – which kinds constitute “cheating” and which don't. Closelyrelated is the extent to which members of the population share ideas about theappropriate way to respond to uncooperative behaviors, namely through thetermination of future interaction. Where more of the population's members sharethese ideas, a higher proportion of them will respond to undesired behaviorswith the punishment required to deter uncooperative behavior.Large or socially diverse populations (demographic features that often movetogether), pose several problems for multilateral punishment's encompassing-nessand thus its ability to support cooperation under anarchy. The larger thepopulation, the more people information about one individual's uncooperativebehavior must reach to cut that person off from the same proportion of potentialexchange partners. Social diversity compounds this problem. A populationconsisting of persons who, for instance, speak different languages will find itharder to communicate cheaply the history of individuals’ conduct to others thanif everyone spoke the same language. Socially diverse populations’ members arealso less likely to share ideas about what constitutes uncooperative behaviorand how to respond to it. For example, persons from one cultural background mayview contractual obligations differently than persons from another. Similarly,one group of persons within a population may see a single instance of another'scheating as sufficient grounds to boycott her perpetually, whereas another groupof persons in that population may have, say, a “three-strike rule” beforethey're willing to initiate such a boycott. Because of the difficulties thatlarge, socially diverse populations pose for multilateral punishment'sencompassing-ness, conventional wisdom concludes that self-governance'seffective scope is limited to small, socially homogeneous ones. Given that mostof the gains from social cooperation lie outside one's small, homogeneous group,this seems to be a severe limitation on self-governance. And indeed it would be.But there's an important problem for this conclusion: reality. History, it turnsout, defies what conventional wisdom dictates. As Fearon and Laitin (1996[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos811491]: 718) point out,in “most places where ethnic groups intermingle, a well-functioning state andlegal system does not exist.” Still, interaction between socially distantpersons in these places is common and overwhelmingly peaceful. How can this be?This essay explores the answer to that question. Existing discussions ofself-governance treat the extent of homogeneity between individuals asexogenously determined and social distance between actors as fixed. However, aliterature addressing the economics of identity, led by Akerlof (1997[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos791570]) and Akerlof andKranton (2000 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos791723]),points out that individuals can and do manipulate their social distance fromothers. Building on their insight, I treat social distance as a variable ofchoice, endogenously determined by individuals themselves. Doing so hasimportant implications for self-governance's ability to secure cooperation inlarge, socially diverse populations. It points to a mechanism of self-governancethat conventional wisdom overlooks.In that mechanism socially distant individuals adopt “degrees of homogeneity”with outsiders they want to trade with. Doing so signals their credibility toone another. The use of social-distance-reducing signals separates cheaters fromcooperators ex ante, ensuring that in equilibrium only cooperators exchange. Bysupplementing partially encompassing multilateral punishment, this mechanism ofself-governance promotes cooperation between the members of large and diversepopulations under anarchy. Evidence from precolonial Africa and medievalinternational trade illustrate how.Signaling with Social Distance in TheorySocial distance is the extent to which individuals share beliefs, customs,practices, appearances, and other characteristics that define their identity.Socially distant individuals share few or none of these categories. They'resocially heterogeneous. Individuals who are socially close share many or all ofthese categories. They're socially homogeneous.Homogeneity is multidimensional. There are innumerable potential dimensionsacross which individuals may have commonality. Two persons might share some ofthe same categories of belief, such as religion or political persuasion. Theymay share appearance, such as the way they dress, or practices, such as how theysettle disputes. Individuals might also share customs, such as the way theygreet strangers, the way they deal with colleagues, or other social rules thatguide their behavior.Some dimensions of homogeneity are more significant than others. For instance,social rules may often be a relatively significant dimension, whereas style ofdress may often be insignificant.1 Which dimensions matter more depends on thecontext in which persons find themselves. The sports team one supports is(usually) a more significant dimension of potential homogeneity between personsinteracting at an athletic event than their religious affiliations. On the otherhand, one's religious affiliations are (usually) a more significant dimension ofpotential homogeneity between persons interacting at church than the sports teamone supports.Homogeneity is also continuous. For each dimension of homogeneity, individualsmay share various margins of commonality over that dimension. Consider thedimension of language.2 If some individual has a complete understanding ofEnglish and some other individual has, say, a 5 percent understanding ofEnglish, the two share marginal homogeneity over the dimension of language.Individuals needn't completely share a dimension of homogeneity for there to besome homogeneity over it. To avoid cumbersome talk of multiple “marginaldimensions of homogeneity” that two persons may share, I call the bundle ofdimensions of homogeneity that persons may share, completely or only marginally,their degree of homogeneity.Nature exogenously fixes some dimensions, and thus degrees, of homogeneity, suchas ethnicity and (to a lesser extent) gender. But it doesn't fix many others,such as religion, language, and customs. These degrees of homogeneity arealterable and thus choice variables for individuals. By manipulating thesevariables, individuals can affect their position vis-à-vis others in socialspace. They can reduce the social distance between themselves and outsidersthrough the decisions they make.3Consider two distinct social groups, each composed of n members. Each group'smembers are completely heterogeneous with respect to the other group's membersbut highly homogeneous with respect to their own. There's no government ineither social group. Nor is there an overarching government that could overseeinteractions between the groups’ members.The population containing both groups, 2n, is too large and diverse to permitthe effective flow of information about individuals’ histories throughout it. Somultilateral punishment alone can't sustain cooperation here. However, thisdoesn't mean multilateral punishment is useless. Large population andsignificant social heterogeneity don't impinge the flow of information abouttraders’ past conduct within an in-group. In-group members, recall, arerelatively few and socially close.Information about cheaters can therefore spread inside a group, but not outsideits bounds where increased population and social heterogeneity prevent this.4So, if any member of one social group cheats another member of his group, allmembers of his group learn this but no member of the other group does. Moreimportant, if any member of one social group cheats a member of the other group,all members of the other group learn this but no member of the cheater's groupdoes. Multilateral punishment is present, but it's only partially encompassing.Punishment for cheating involves foregoing trade opportunities with the membersof the social group one cheated, but not the members of the other.Partially encompassing multilateral punishment can't secure the same level ofcooperation as totally encompassing multilateral punishment involving the entirepopulation, 2n, can. But it can secure some. Sufficiently patient persons –those who value the discounted stream of indefinite future trades with the groupmembers their trading partner is a part of more than the one-shot payoff ofcheating – will cooperate when threatened with partially encompassingmultilateral punishment. They always trade honestly with persons who are outsidetheir group.In contrast, sufficiently impatient persons – those who don't value thediscounted stream of indefinite future trades with the group members theirtrading partner is a part of more than the one-shot payoff of cheating – won'ttrade honestly with persons who are outside their group when threatened onlywith partially encompassing multilateral punishment. They will be unable torealize the benefits of trading with outsiders indefinitely if they cheat. Butbecause they discount those benefits steeply, they find cheating outsidersprofitable nonetheless. These persons always take advantage of persons who areoutside group.Suppose that all of one social group's members are highly patient – patientenough that even the partial multilateral punishment described earlier issufficient to induce them to always cooperate in their interactions with theother social group's members. In contrast, the other social group contains somepositive proportion of highly impatient members – persons for whom totallyencompassing multilateral punishment would be sufficient to induce cooperationwith the highly patient social group's members, but for whom the previouslydescribed partial multilateral punishment is insufficient.Because they never cheat trading partners who are outside their group, let'scall the highly patient type of persons, who compose the entire former socialgroup but only part of the latter, cooperators. Because they always cheattrading partners who are outside their group, let's call the highly impatienttype of persons, who compose no part of the former social group but part of thelatter, cheaters.Consider a member of the social group whose members include some cheaters, p,who approaches for exchange a member of the other group whose members are allcooperators, q. p privately observes his type. He alone knows whether he himselfis highly patient – that is, a cooperator – or highly impatient – that is, acheater.q's problem is straightforward: he knows nothing about p except that p is aforeigner – a member of another social group whose beliefs, practices, and so onare very different from his – and that p may be a cheater. If p is one of thecooperative members of his group, q will benefit handsomely from trading with p.But if p turns out to be a cheater – something q can only learn after it's toolate – q will lose substantially from having traded with p.If multilateral punishment were fully encompassing, q would have no reason tofear trading with p. Even if p is a cheater, he cooperates when threatened withcomprehensive multilateral punishment. But because of the large and sociallydiverse population that constitutes 2n, multilateral punishment isn'tcomprehensive and thus can't be relied on to ensure cooperative exchange with pif p is a cheater. If the probability that p is a cheater is sufficiently high,q will decline to trade with p. Because p may have been a cooperator, gains fromintergroup trade go unrealized.The breakdown described here is not, as commonly believed, a breakdown ofself-governance. It's a breakdown of multilateral punishment. Multilateralpunishment aims to secure self-governance by “sorting” individuals accordingwhether they're cooperators or cheaters ex post. Herein lays its problem.Sorting individuals by whether they're cooperators, who should be interactedwith again, or cheaters, who shouldn't be, after the fact is an ineffective wayof trying to support cooperation when populations are large and heterogeneous,as the combined population that p and q inhabit is. Large, diverse populationsimpinge the information flow and coordination needed for fully effective ex postsorting. Such sorting requires everyone to learn about everyone else's historiesand to share notions about what those histories mean and how to behave in lightof them. These are precisely the requirements that large, socially heterogeneouspopulations can't fulfill.But what about the possibility of sorting individuals by whether they'recooperators or cheaters ex ante – that is, before trade takes place? If thatcould be achieved, q could confidently interact with p and realize the gainsfrom trade that lie outside his small, socially homogeneous group. He could beconfident because he could be sure to interact with p only if p had already beensorted into the “cooperator class” despite the fact that he lacks informationabout p's history, that p is, moreover, an unknown foreigner, and the fact thatthe members of q's social group may have, for instance, different ideas abouthow to respond to uncooperative behavior.Unfortunately for q, p's cheater or cooperator status isn't stamped on hisforehead. Only p has that information. But if q could somehow incentivize q toreveal it, he could sort q by whether he's a cheater or a cooperator ex antenonetheless.Enter signaling. Unlike mechanisms of self-governance based purely on ex postsorting, such as the discipline of continuous dealings, those based on ex antesorting, such as signaling, require neither small population size nor socialhomogeneity to work. If q requires p to make a costly up-front investment beforehe's willing to trade with p – an investment the value of which p can onlyrecoup over time in the course of many cooperative interactions with q － q canincentivize p to reveal his status as a cheater or cooperator and then sort p onthat basis before they trade.Such an investment on p's part acts as a signal to q: an action that accuratelycommunicates to q the type of person p is and in doing so reveals p's otherwiseprivate information about his status. If the investment q requires p to make isexpensive enough, p's willingness to make that investment will be perfectlycorrelated with his status as a cooperator or a cheater.The reason for this is simple: it costs p more to make such an investment ifhe's a cheater than if he's a cooperator. The value of the investment q requiresp to make to trade with him can only be recovered through repeated interactionsover time. And, because of partially encompassing multilateral punishment, qonly has the opportunity for such interactions as long as he doesn't cheat p, inwhich case q and the other members of q's social group cut p off. Cheaters,however, are more impatient than cooperators. They discount the gains fromfuture interactions more than cooperators do. That, recall, is why cheaterscheat in the first place. Because of this, cheaters find it more expensive thancooperators to make long-term investments of the kind q requires to enableexchange.This difference between cheaters’ and cooperators’ expected payoff of makingsome costly up-front investment means that, at some level of investment q canrequire of p to enable exchange, q will find it unprofitable to make thatinvestment if he's a cheater but profitable to make if he's a cooperator.Conditional on observing this level of investment by p, q can confidently tradewith p. If q doesn't observe that p has made this investment, he declines totrade with p. Because gains from trade between p and q are only available if pis a cooperator, signaling ensures that, while the potential dangers of tradingoutside one's social group are averted, the potential gains available from doingfrom doing so are captured.The investment, or signal, that q requires to be willing to trade must havecertain attributes to be effective. It must be publicly observable. If it's not,q won't know whether p has made it, so p's status as a cheater or cooperatorwill remain p's private information. The investment must be sufficientlyspecific. It must have value predominately in its ability to enable trade with qor other members of his social group rather than in other purposes too. If theinvestment isn't specific, p won't lose much if he decides to cheat q because,even though q and q's fellow group members will boycott p thereafter, p will beable to redeploy his investment for other useful purposes without significantloss. The investment q requires of p must also satisfy the single-crossingproperty: it must be more expensive for p to make if he's a cheater than if he'sa cooperator. A sufficiently large investment, the value of which can only berecovered down the road, ensures this because cheaters and cooperators havedifferent degrees of patience.What kind of investment, or signal, that q could require of p satisfies theseconditions? One rooted in social distance.p and q are socially heterogeneous. That's what created the problem for anarchywe're concerned with in the first place. So, if in order to enable exchange withp, q requires p to invest in adopting various social attributes that q and hisfellow group members share – some degree of social homogeneity with them – butp, as an outsider, doesn't share, q can use his social distance from p, whichwould otherwise make him distrustful of p, to facilitate intergroup exchangeinstead of precluding it.Examples of degrees of homogeneity that q may require p to adopt for thispurpose include q's language, his group's customs, their religious rituals,dress, and so on. Investments in such social-distance-reducing signals arecostly, so their value can only be recovered through repeated, cooperativeinteractions with p or other members of his social group over time. Some, suchas learning an outsider's language, are quite costly by themselves. Others, suchas adopting an outsider's dress, aren't, but when combined with others, canbecome so in aggregate. Investments in degrees of homogeneity are also publiclyobservable. It's easy to tell if an outsider has adopted one's customs, forexample, or not. Further, as “cultural” attributes, these investments tend to besocial-group-specific. Because p's potential investments have these features, byrequiring a social-distance-reducing signal from him, q can turn the central bugof intergroup trade under anarchy into a feature.5Social-distance-reducing investments aren't the only kind of signals individualsmight use to facilitate exchange where multilateral punishment alone isineffective for this purpose. But in the context of socially diverse populationsin particular, these sorts of investments may be privileged over others. Whereindividuals are socially homogeneous, there's little room forsocial-distance-reducing signals to play a role in conveying credibility.Adopting the behaviors and practices of someone like you isn't costly. Adoptingthe behaviors and practices of someone unlike you is. This makes adoptingdegrees of homogeneity with an outsider a useful signal of the sender'scredibility. In this sense social-distance-reducing signals are specially suitedto intergroup interactions.Social-distance-reducing investments also exhibit what Bliege Bird (1999[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos799274]), Smith andBliege Bird (2000[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos846487]), and Smith etal. (2001 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos846251]) call“broadcast efficiency.” Because in-group members are socially close, degrees ofhomogeneity that an individual from one group adopts to enable trade with anindividual from another group also create degrees of homogeneity with the othermembers of that group. The social-distance-reducing investments that one memberof this group interprets as a signal of credibility are interpreted this way byother members of his group as well. The adopting individual therefore benefitsthrough such investments not only by the trade he enables with the particularindividual he initially approaches for exchange, but also by the trade heconsequently enables with every other member of that individual's social group.Because of this, persons may often gain more by making social-distance-reducinginvestments, which have a wider “audience,” to enable exchange with outsidersthan by using other costly investments for that purpose.The signaling mechanism just described illustrates why the conventional wisdomthat sees self-governance's effective scope as limited to small, homogeneousgroups is mistaken. That wisdom stems from approaching social distance as thoughit were exogenous and fixed when in fact it's endogenous and variable. It alsostems from a preoccupation with mechanisms of self-governance that sort personsex post, which ignores mechanisms of self-governance that sort persons ex ante.Most important, this signaling mechanism helps explain the observation withwhich this essay began: in the world we actually live in, cooperation is commonbetween socially distant persons, even where effective government is absent. Inthe sections that follow I turn to some historical examples of such cooperationand the role that social-distance-reducing signaling played in promoting it.Social-Distance-Reducing Signaling in PracticePrecolonial AfricaIn precolonial Africa, relations between different social groups’ membersoccurred frequently without government (see, for instance, Curtin et al. 1995[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos807145]; Bohannan 1968[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos800272]). Despite this,“[l]ong before the Europeans appeared on the scene,” precolonial Africans hadestablished domestic and “international trade, with developed systems of credit,insurance…[and] arbitration. Law and order were normally maintained andstrangers honored their business obligations” (Cohen 1969[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos804551]: 6). There was“intensive social interaction between various ethnic groupings” that involved“extensive credit arrangements, often between total strangers from differenttribes” (Cohen 1969[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos804551]: 6).To make this intergroup cooperation under anarchy possible, members of differentsocial groups invested in the customs and practices of outsiders with whom theywanted to exchange, signaling their credibility by reducing their socialdistance. Three potential dimensions of homogeneity that precolonial Africansused for this purpose proved particularly important: relationships to authority,land practices, and religious practice/association.Relationship to AuthorityIn the absence of formal governments, informal community leaders, or headmen,governed many precolonial Africans. These leaders were typically village eldersor others of high social standing in their communities, who established socialrules for community members and resolved disputes that might emerge between them(see, for instance, Middleton 1971[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos833428]). Some informalleaders also acted as community “gatekeepers,” requesting gifts from individualsas a sign of good faith to access their communities.In some cases refusing to abide by social rules could lead to formal punishment,such as imprisonment. But more often it led to informal punishment, such asostracism. For example, if an individual “chose to ignore a ruling given by thechief, he could do so with impunity; but if public opinion was behind thechief's decision, he might lose the privileges” of membership in that community(Howell 1968 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos819719]:192). The informal nature of many precolonial communities thus made submissionto a leader's authority largely a matter of choice.Internally, precolonial communities tended to be highly homogenous. Individualsshared the same customs, practices, appearances, religion, language, methods ofhandling disputes, property arrangements, and many other significant potentialdimensions of commonality, making them socially close. In contrast, betweengroups there could be considerable social distance. Different headmen leddifferent communities, and headmen established important social rules in theircommunities, so many of these potential dimensions of homogeneity differed fromone community to the next. The informal leader one chose to follow was thereforean important part of one's social identity.Both gift giving and submitting oneself to the authority of a community's rulersand dispute resolution procedures reduced social distance between outsiders andin-group members over important potential dimensions of homogeneity: usage ofthe same social rules, including the custom of gift giving, methods of settlingdisputes, and more generally recognizing the same informal leader's authority.These social-distance-reducing investments were costly. Adopting the practice ofgift giving involved investing tangible resources – the gift – to reduce socialdistance with the community an outsider desired to interact with. Submitting tothe headman's social rules and authority involved investing intangible resources– placing one in a vulnerable position vis-à-vis an unknown community leader –to achieve the same purpose. A newcomer might be uncertain whether he wouldreceive less favorable decisions in disputes with existing community members,imposing on him a cost of submitting to the leader's rulings.An outsider who behaved uncooperatively after adopting such degrees ofhomogeneity lost his investment because, as previously noted, bad behavior ledthe community to reject him. Because of this, as long as the one-time payoff ofcheating was smaller than the value of the gift the outsider was required togive in the gift-giving case, or the cost of potentially unfavorable decisionsin the submitting-to-authority case, requiring outsiders to adopt thesepractices as a precondition of “entry” permitted communities to identifyoutsiders with whom they could profitably interact. Partly as a result ofsignaling with social distance, “far from there being a single ‘tribal’identity, most Africans moved in and out of multiple identities, definingthemselves at one moment as subject to this chief, at another moment as a memberof that cult, at another moment as part of this clan, and at another moment asan initiate in that professional guild. These overlapping networks ofassociation and exchange extended over wide areas” (Ranger 1985[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos839798]: 248).Property PracticesPrecolonial Africans also adopted the property practices of outsiders with whomthey wanted to interact to facilitate intergroup trade. Precolonial communitiesdidn't own the land they used in the sense that they could sell it to others.However, they did exercise some control over who may use the land they currentlyoccupied and how it could be used. Informal community leaders often directedcommunity members in this regard. Elsewhere, Earth Priests – community leadersrepresenting a link to the historical first user of the land – performed thisfunction.Land was often seen as having mystical properties, which entailed theperformance of ritual customs and taboos that Earth Priests established. Toassimilate to the community, outsiders who desired to engage it agreed toparticipate in these customs and respect the taboos that Earth Priestsidentified. Further, similar to the gift-giving practice described earlier,outsiders seeking to interact with a particular land-using community often madegifts to the Earth Priests “as an expression of goodwill” (Colson 1969[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos804934]: 54).Submitting to the Earth Priest's ritual taboos was costly. For example, one ofthe Earth Priest's taboos might be a prohibition on cultivating the more fertileland in the area because of its sacred status. Alternatively, if he wanted tojoin a land-using community, an outsider might have to accept the Earth Priest'sdecision that directed him to work a less productive plot of land on the groundsthat he was a newcomer, or because the more productive land was already in use.Only by remaining in good standing in the community could an outsider recoup hisgift's cost, or the cost of cultivating less fertile ground, through continualinteraction with its members. Consequently, only outsiders who intended tobehave cooperatively agreed to adopt a community's ritual land customs andtaboos, making this an effective social-distance-reducing signal of credibility.Religious Practices and AssociationsPrecolonial Africans also used religious practice and association associal-distance-reducing signals to enable intergroup cooperation. One way toreduce social distance along these lines was to participate in an outsider'sreligious practices and beliefs. Alternatively, one might join an outsider'sreligious association or convert completely to her religion.6Cults and fraternal societies, such as the Ekpe, Okonko, and Ogboni, oftenperformed quasi-religious and judiciary functions in precolonial Africancommunities. As one European observer noted, in the absence of “any thing likeour establishment of Judges, Police, Prisons, and Penal Servitude,” suchquasi-religious societies “are simply [the] methods by which law and order issecured” in many African communities (Stopford 1901[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos848441]: 95). Thesesocieties often created religious customs and practices, as well as disputeresolution procedures, which outsiders could adopt to reduce their socialdistance with in-group members. In some cases societies such as the Ekpe chargeda “membership fee” to join. In others, “cult membership was open to any whowished to join” and agreed to adopt the customs and practices of the society(Colson 1969 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos804934]:59).In both cases religious adoption was costly to outsiders, and more so forimpatient outsiders than for patient ones. If a membership fee was required tojoin the society, this cost was partly financial. Even when it wasn't, outsiderswho participated in or converted to these quasi-religious associations had toadopt costly customs that could include surrendering their goods to spirits,submission to potentially costly procedures for conflict resolution,restrictions on behavior such as diet, and the recurrent investment of theirtime in society-related activities.Impatient outsiders didn't find making these costly investments worthwhile.Because they intended to cheat, and cheating was frequently punished withrejection from the community, cheaters couldn't profit from investing in thecostly religious activities of in-group members. For patient outsiders thingswere different. Because their honest conduct ensured they would remain in thecommunity long enough to recover the investment cost of engaging in thecommunity's religious practices, they willingly did so. By sorting outsidersaccording to their willingness to make costly religious investments ex ante,precolonial Africans selected outsiders they could cooperate with, facilitatingintergroup trade.The point of this brief discussion of precolonial Africa isn't that everyintergroup interaction was peaceful and cooperative. It most certainly wasn't.The point is that there was significant cooperation between large numbers ofsocially diverse people without government. That cooperation was supported bymechanisms of self-governance based partly on social-distance-reducing signalingwhere the discipline of continuous dealings alone was insufficient.Medieval International TradeMedieval international traders also used social-distance-reducing signals tofacilitate exchange in their large, socially diverse population withoutgovernment.7 The evidence of how they did so is based on documents from thethirteenth through fifteenth centuries left by merchants engaged ininternational trade under what is known as the lex mercatoria, or law merchant.Lopez and Raymond (1990[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos830186]) have collectedand translated many of these documents, which I draw on in the discussion thatfollows.The law merchant is a polycentric system of customary law. It arose from thedesire of socially distant traders in the late eleventh century to engage incross-cultural exchange. In the absence of a supranational agency of formalenforcement in particular, and often of national state-based means of suchenforcement more generally, this custom-based system relied heavily on privatearbitration via merchant courts for resolving disputes. Between the earlytwelfth and late sixteenth centuries, virtually all European trade betweensocially distant persons operated on this basis, with great success.Reputation played an important role in supporting this trade. But because ofinternational traders’ large and socially diverse population, multilateralpunishment was only partially encompassing and thus often inadequate to protecttraders’ property without government. Traders supplemented the discipline ofcontinuous dealings with social-distance-reducing signals.Merchants engaged in medieval international commerce had the opportunity toexchange with outsiders from many different social groups. Thus they had toadapt themselves to their circumstances to enable intergroup trade. Frequentlythis involved adopting the manners and disposition of the outsiders with whomone desired to trade.For instance, according to a Neapolitan merchant writing in 1458, in order to“enjoy as much reputation or credit” as needed to facilitate exchange,“merchants must not have the fierce manners of husky men-at-arms, nor must theyhave the soft manners of jesters and comedians, but they must be serious inspeaking, walking, and in all actions” (Lopez and Raymond 1990[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos830186]: 418). Marginalhomogeneity over the dimension of “manners” contributed to a signal oftrustworthiness that enabled intergroup trade. So did marginal homogeneity overthe dimension of “appearance.” Thus a merchant writing from Florence sometime inthe early fourteenth century advises traders traveling to England to “[w]earmodest colors, be humble, [and] be dull in appearance ” (Lopez and Raymond 1990[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos830186]: 423).Other dimensions of homogeneity also served as the basis for signalingcredibility among heterogeneous medieval merchants. Writing in Florence at thebeginning of the fourteenth century, for instance, Dino Compagni, in his poetry,points to the importance of homogeneity over two particular dimensions inenabling intergroup trade. The successful merchant, he writes, will be “Genialin greeting without complaints,” and “He will be worthier if he goes to church”(Lopez and Raymond 1990[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos830186]: 426). Sharedmanners and religious practice signaled credibility to outsiders, makingexchange possible. Traders adopted the language of outsiders toward this endtoo. For instance, a trader writing between 846 and 886 writes: “The merchantsspeak Arabic, Persian, Roman, Frankish, Spanish, and Slavonic” to enableexchange with foreign traders (Lopez and Raymond 1990[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos830186]: 31).A merchant practice guide written in Florence between 1310 and 1340 providesparticularly clear evidence of reliance on social-distance-reducing investmentsas a means of enabling intergroup trade. This guide is explicit about howtraders created degrees of homogeneity with the outsiders they desired toexchange with. In a telling passage it imparts advice to Western traders whodesire to exchange with the Chinese. Advising the Western trader, the passagereads: “First, it is advisable for him to let his beard grow long and not shave.And at Tana he should furnish himself with dragomans.…And besides dragomans heought to take along at least two good manservants who know the Cumanic tonguewell. And if the merchant wishes to take along from Tana any woman with him…hewill be regarded as a man of higher condition than if he does not take one”(Lopez and Raymond 1990[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos830186]: 356–357).8Perhaps most significantly, traders’ voluntary submission to the business andarbitration practices embodied in the lex mercatoria created an important degreeof homogeneity between them. For example, traders voluntarily adopted, amongothers, certain media of exchange, standardized weights and measures (Lopez andRaymond 1990 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos830186]:147–150), notaries (Lopez 1976[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos830010]: 108), witnessesto contract (North 1990[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos837358]: 121, 129), andmembership in transnational trading associations and guilds (Berman 1983[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos798496]: 342). Dimensionsof homogeneity besides those under the rubric of the law merchant were used toenable intergroup trade too. For instance, traders used intermarriage,citizenship in multiple countries (Lopez 1976[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos830010]: 67, 63), andreligious affiliation (Berman 1983[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos798496]: 346) for thispurpose.Medieval international trade was essential to the economic growth of Europe.Self-governance under the law merchant was its foundation. As Benson (1990[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos797876]: 31) puts it,“the commercial revolution of the eleventh through fifteenth centuries thatultimately led to the Renaissance and industrial revolution could not haveoccurred without…this system.” In establishing this system of self-governance,the medieval law merchant also laid the foundation for modern internationaltrade, which I consider in a later essay. Because of this system, medieval tradeflourished, often without the benefit of government.Conventional wisdom has it partly right: if the only mechanisms ofself-governance persons could rely on to promote cooperation without governmentwere based on the discipline of continuous dealings alone, successfulself-governance would indeed often be limited to small, socially homogenousgroups. What that wisdom has wrong is the implicit suggestion that these are theonly mechanisms of self-governance available to persons in anarchy. The factthat they're not helps explain why we observe successful self-governance even inlarge populations of socially diverse persons.Social-distance-reducing signaling is itself but one, supplementary mechanism ofself-governance that facilitates intergroup cooperation without government. Likeall such mechanisms, this one too will only sometimes be effective, and thus beused by persons in anarchy, while many other times it will not.Social-distance-reducing signaling shouldn't be seen as a panacea for overcomingthe problems of intergroup cooperation without government. But it should openour minds to the possibility of a variety of mechanisms that serve this purpose.As the next chapter illustrates, that variety is as rich as the variety ofcontext-specific problems that persons in anarchy confront.* This chapter is based on and uses material from Leeson, Peter T. 2008[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos825374]. “Social Distanceand Self-Enforcing Exchange.” Journal of Legal Studies 37(1): 161–188 [© 2008The University of Chicago], and Leeson, Peter T. 2006. “Cooperation andConflict: Evidence on Self-Enforcing Arrangements and Heterogeneous Groups.”American Journal of Economics and Sociology 65(4): 891–907 [© 2006 AmericanJournal of Economics and Sociology, Inc.]. 1 However, Rafaeli and Pratt (1993[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos839396]) find that in atleast some cases dress does constitute a significant dimension of homogeneity. 2 Lazear (1999 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos825008])examines minority populations’ incentives to adopt majority populations’languages as a means of enabling cooperative interaction. 3 Clay's (1997 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos803879])work alludes to this fact as well. She notes how in Mexican California, Americantraders gained access to Mexican communities’ internal contract-enforcementinstitutions by investing in Mexican identities. For example, American tradersmarried locally, spoke Spanish in the home, and accepted Catholicism. 4 Iannaccone (1992[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos820089]) considersreligious sacrifice as a mechanism of securing intragroup cooperation. As Idiscuss later in the chapter, religious sacrifice has also been used as a formof social-distance-reducing signaling to facilitate intergroup cooperation. 5 In some cases decreasing one's social distance with an outsider will increasehis social distance with the members of his in-group. Although this could reducethe scope for intragroup exchange in certain cases (e.g., converting to anoutsider's religion, which could sever some ties with in-group members whopractice an opposing religion), in general it shouldn't. In-group members havevery good information about the credibility of one another. Unless the practicea person adopts from an outsider reduces his patience (and thus credibility),members of his in-group should be equally willing to trade with him after headopts this practice as before he has done so. In fact, adopting costlybehaviors of outsiders may indicate a person's greater patience (and thusgreater credibility), making him a more attractive trading partner among hisin-group members. However, this relies on persons placing greater weight onmonetary payoffs, which are unchanged or increase with respect to an in-groupmember who reduces his social distance with outsiders, over psychic payoffs,which may fall if in-group members believe it's important to maintain one's owncustoms. 6 For instance, some precolonial Africans converted to Christianity tofacilitate interaction with European visitors. 7 The brief discussion that follows is intended to illustrate howsocial-distance-reducing signaling facilitated intergroup trade in the medievalperiod, not to suggest that this was the only informal mechanism operating toenable exchange under the medieval law merchant. It certainly wasn't. Forexample, as Greif, Milgrom, and Weingast (1994[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos815881]) have pointedout, merchant guilds were also among those private institutions used tofacilitate medieval trade. Milgrom, North, and Weingast (1990[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos833757]) point to thepresence of yet another private institutional arrangement that may havecontributed to the growth of medieval exchange. 8 “Dragomans” is a medieval term for guides in Eastern regions."},{"pageContent":"3 The Laws of Lawlessness*Cooperation under anarchy when persons are from different social groups is onething. When those groups are avowed enemies, it's quite another. The idea thatself-governance could promote cooperation between socially distant hostilesseems absurd.Yet it can, and it has. In the words of John Stuart Mill (1848[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos834035]: 882),“Insecurity paralyzes only when it is such in nature and in degree that noenergy of which mankind in general are capable affords any tolerable means ofself-protection.” That energy, you will see, is substantial.This essay examines a significant and long-lasting era of intergroup anarchyamong English and Scottish citizens on the Anglo-Scottish border in thesixteenth century.1 The border people pillaged, plundered, and raided oneanother as a way of life they called “reiving.” To regulate this system ofintergroup banditry and prevent it from degenerating into chaos, borderinhabitants developed a self-governing system of cross-border criminal lawcalled the Leges Marchiarum. These “laws of lawlessness” governed all aspects ofcross-border interaction and spawned novel institutions of their enforcement,including “days of truce,” bonds, “bawling,” and “trod.”In contrast to the previous essay, where the central problem that sociallydistant persons confronted under anarchy was enabling exchange, in the contextthis essay considers, where such persons under anarchy are bitter hostiles, thecentral problem they confront shifts from supporting intergroup trade toregulating intergroup violence. The issues considered here therefore overlap andforeshadow the ones that are the direct focus of the essays in Part II[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_011.html#filepos182009] of this book.The sixteenth-century Anglo-Scottish borderlands aren't unique in giving rise toa self-governing system of rules regulating violent conflict between sociallydistant enemy groups. Trench warfare between German and British soldiers duringWorld War I, for instance, also gave rise to related, private, violence-reducingrules. Interactions between opposing soldiers established norms governingpermissible times and locations for sniper fire. Unwritten, spontaneouslyemerged rules also created unofficial (and, from their governments’perspectives, undesirable) truces and permitted opposing soldiers to receiverations (see, for example, Axelrod 1984[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos795110]; Ashworth 1980[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos794771]). Similarly,during the wars between Britain, France, and Spain throughout the eighteenth andearly nineteenth centuries, private men-of-war operated under a self-governingsystem of rules that regulated violence and prize taking at sea. This system,which I examine closely in Part II[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_011.html#filepos182009], facilitatedprisoner exchanges, the ransom rather than seizure of captured vessels, andagreements to abstain from destructive conflict. Like these self-governingsystems for controlling intergroup violence between enemies, the LegesMarchiarum didn't eliminate such conflict. But it did regulate it, reduce it,and provide social order to an otherwise bloody and chaotic environment.My discussion draws on primary source documents left behind by borderinhabitants and observers between 1249 and 1603. Foremost among these is theLeges Marchiarum itself – a series of documents pertaining to the rules of theborder from the mid-thirteenth century to 1597. William Nicolson, Lord Bishop ofCarlisle, collected and complied these documents about a century after theAnglo-Scottish union brought the era this essay describes to a close. I also usea series of sixteenth-century manuscripts called The Border Papers. The Britishcrown compiled these records, which contain correspondence between variousborder inhabitants and the monarchs of England. Together with the LegesMarchiarum, these papers form the most important and detailed firsthand accountsof life on the Anglo-Scottish border.2Intergroup AnarchyThe Anglo-Scottish borderlands extended on the Scottish side from the River Creeto the North Sea coast and on the British side from the coast of Cumberland tothe coast of Northumberland. This territory was divided into six “Marches,”three on each side: the English and Scottish East, Middle, and West Marches. TheMarches covered the areas that today roughly encompass the Southern Uplands andLowland of Scotland on the Scottish side and counties of Cumbria andNorthumberland on the English side (Fraser 1995[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812492]). TheAnglo-Scottish marches were thus home to two distinct social groups: the Englishand Scottish borderers, separated by cultural, geographic, political, andnational boundaries.For much of the 250-year period between the first War of Scottish Independencein 1296 and the Treaty of Norham in 1551, England and Scotland were in openconflict with one another. Because the borderlands separated the warringnations, the border people were ensconced in this conflict, facing one anotherin battles during official Anglo-Scottish war and often existing in a state ofundeclared conflict with one another when official war wasn't raging. Marchinhabitants thus grew to be bitter enemies of their counterparts on the oppositeside of the frontier. Inter-borderer acrimony wasn't exclusively divided alongnational lines. Inhabitants on the same side of the Anglo-Scottish border couldand did clash with one another as well. But in light of the continued state ofopen conflict between the two countries, which side of the border the Marchpeople found themselves on was a crucial and powerful factor in shaping theirfriends and their enemies.The second half of the sixteenth century saw a period without officialAnglo-Scottish war. Still, more than 250 years of protracted and bloody battlebetween England and Scotland, and consequently the English and Scottish borderpeople, left the frontier citizens in a state of severe distrust and acrimonytoward the citizens on the opposite side of the border. Despite this period oftenuous peace, the “tradition of enmity” between English and Scottish bordererscontinued, each group's members viewing the others as targets who they mightmurder, kidnap, and despoil without compunction.Officially, each March was governed by a “warden” appointed by their respectivemonarch. Wardens in turn appointed various underlings to help administer theirareas. In theory, wardens administered their countries’ domestic laws inpeacetime between the two nations and mustered military forces in their areasduring times of military conflict. In practice, however, things were verydifferent.“[L]ack of a strong settled government” characterized the Marches (Tough 1928[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos850115]: 28). Severalreasons account for this. Some wardens were engaged in the very violentbehaviors they were supposed to control. In other cases they were weaker thanthe powerful clans they were supposed to oversee. England and Scotland'sfrequent indifference to controlling their borderlands, which forced wardens toadminister their Marches “on myne owne purse,” as one warden complained, meantthat in some cases wardens didn't bother with trying to enforce domestic laws.And some Marches experienced periods without any warden at all (see, forinstance, Fraser 1995[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812492]: 34; The BorderPapers 1583: vol. 1, no. 197; Tough 1928[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos850115]: 35; The BorderPapers 1594: vol. 1, no. 948, see also, vol. 1, nos. 916, 930; The Border Papers1585: vol. 1, no. 341).3Despite the weakness of March governments, the most important sense in which theborderlands were anarchic wasn't internal to each March, or even between Marcheson the same side of the border. They were most importantly anarchic in the sensethat each kingdom, its March wardens, and the rest of its March citizens existedin a state of nature vis-à-vis the kingdom, March wardens, and March citizens onthe other side of the border. Until the first decade of the seventeenth century,England and Scotland remained sovereign kingdoms. Each country's domestic systemof law and order extended only to the Marches in its territory.4 As borderhistorian Cynthia Neville (1998[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos836588]: 192) points out,“Scottish miscreants,” for instance, “whether they crossed the border in largenumbers in organised raids or individually as free-booting felons, were outsidethe king's allegiance and, in turn, beyond the reach of the king's common-lawjudges.”No supranational sovereign existed to eliminate intergroup anarchy. There was nogovernment with authority to promulgate rules over both groups of frontiercitizens. Common formal laws and courts, and rules for dealing with cross-borderinteractions, such as a murder in one realm by an inhabitant of the other,didn't exist.5 The result was a large “lawless” arena for the interactionsbetween March inhabitants on opposite sides of the Anglo-Scottish border. Thiserected a substantial obstacle for addressing intergroup crime along thefrontier, because neither England nor Scotland had the authority to do so.6 Inthis way the border “formed almost a lawless state within, or between, twocountries” (Fraser 1995[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812492]: 5).Threatening Chaos: The Anglo-Scottish Reiving SystemThe borderers were peculiar in many ways. But perhaps their most strikingpeculiarity was how many of them embraced banditry as a way of life.7 Thispeculiarity was largely the result of the near-constant conflict between theirbroader societies. Frequent war left both border areas decimated, andinhabitants had little incentive to establish productive enterprises that wouldonly be destroyed in the next violent outburst between their nations. Inresponse to this situation, many borderers turned to thievery directed at theirenemies in the opposite realm.“The border thieves were no ordinary thieves,” however (Tough 1928[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos850115]: 48). Unlikecommon bandits, for them, “raiding, arson, kidnapping, murder and extortion werean important part of the social system” (Fraser 1995[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812492]: 3). Theseactivities composed a system they called “reiving.” Those who took part in itwere called the “border reivers.” These are the notorious “steel bonnets” whoseexploits and personages are memorialized in the prose of Sir Walter Scott (1802[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos843744]–1803, 1814[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos843902]–1817).The reivers thieved and raided professionally. Reiving involved the usual sortsof behavior one would expect to attend violent theft. These included killing,maiming, kidnapping and ransoming, and other typical means of banditry. Moreexotic reiving activities included “black meale,” the medieval equivalent of theprotection racket, and a custom called the “deadly feud.” Black meale grewdirectly out of border anarchy. Our word “blackmail” derives from this borderinstitution, although its meaning has evolved over time. The border institutionreferred to agreements between reivers and other borderers for propertyprotection or, as one borderer called them, “compacts for their private safety”(Fraser 1995 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812492]:191).8Deadly feud was the custom of killing the clan members of one's rivals,ostensibly in response to a violent act perpetrated against the feud initiator,propelling the deadly back-and-forth to its next turn, and so on. As one borderobserver described it (Fraser 1995[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812492]: 170; see also,The Border Papers 1583: vol. 1, no. 197):> The people of this countrey hath had one barbarous custom among them; if any> two be displeased, they expect no lawe, but bang it out bravely, one and his> kindred against the other and his; they will subject themselves to no justice,> but in an inhumane and barbarous manner fight and kill one another. This> fighting they call their feides, or deadly feides, a word so barbarous that I> cannot express it in any other tongue.Of course, the borderers didn't exclusively reive. Someone needed to producesomething for others to steal. So, although many borderers regularly engaged inreiving, most were also part-time agriculturalists, raising crops such as oatsand rye, as well as livestock. “Thieving, for instance, was a recognizedoccupation, but the professional thief could and did occupy his spare time…infarming of one kind or another” (Tough 1928[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos850115]: 47).Seasonal concerns dictated much of this activity. The prime reiving season wasbetween fall and spring and tended to be concentrated most heavily betweenMichaelmas (September 29) and Martinmas (November 11). Most reiving was reservedfor the fall because during this season nights were relatively long, andlivestock – a primary target of violent plunder – was both accessible and strongenough to drive from the victim's home to the thief's. During the winter cattleand sheep were weak. And during the summer borderers moved their livestock tohigher pastures where they were comparatively difficult to access (Fraser 1995[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812492]: 93). Because ofthese practical constraints, at least the season in which one could mostreasonably expect to be plundered was predictable, even if the particular month,week, or day wasn't.Reiving's focus on livestock both influenced and was influenced by theseconsiderations. Stealing cattle required cattle healthy enough to steal, whichin turn required agricultural production sufficient to raise healthy animals.This fact had a predictable effect on agricultural production. Often it didn'tmake sense for reivers to direct their thievery at agricultural products. Doingso would only diminish their ability to steal livestock later in the year.Further, because the reiving season didn't interrupt agricultural production,this had the pleasant effect of enabling border inhabitants to raise enoughcrops to feed their livestock and themselves, permitting at least a low level ofproduction and consumption despite seasonal reiving. On the other side ofthings, the borderlands were far from fertile lands ideal for agriculturalproduction. Thus shifting from livestock to predominantly agriculturalproduction wasn't an option. The infertility of the soil, in turn, is partlywhat dictated productive activity devoted to livestock, helping focus reivingactivity on the theft of cattle.The “Lawles and Disobedient Disposition of the most part of the Inhabitants” ofthe border posed a serious threat to social order (Nicolson 1747[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos837005]: 104). As Englishwarden Robert Carey described the problem, “we are macht with a people withoutlaues, and we are bound to keepe laues” (Tough 1928[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos850115]: 258). Carey'sexasperation reflected the futility of trying to provide order to the borderpeople through “the Queenes lawes which they dare not answer” (The Border Papers1583: vol. 1, no. 197).9The lawlessness these observers expressed, however, doesn't mean the borderersdidn't have laws. In the absence of government to create and enforce laws thatcould govern interactions between the members of hostile social groups on bothsides of the border, the borderers’ interactions gave rise to an independentbody of customary rules that regulated reiving and created a self-governing,intergroup legal system for this purpose. That system was called the LegesMarchiarum, or laws of the Marches.10Leges Marchiarum: The Laws of LawlessnessThe Leges Marchiarum's customary rules developed organically from cross-borderinteractions. “[T]hey are ancient and loveable custumis, ressavit and standingin force as law, be lange use, and mutual consent of the Wardanis and subjectisof baith the realms” (Balfour 1754[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos795434]).11 EventuallyEnglish and Scottish peace commissioners codified “these Laws,” which “have longkept in our…Borders,” as treaties between the kingdoms (Nicolson 1747[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos837005]: vi).Because no supranational government existed, this cross-border cooperation wasforged without the benefit of an overarching central authority to facilitate theprocess. The individuals acting on behalf of each kingdom who set down inwriting and subsequently modified the Leges Marchiarum had no recourse to aformal agency that could establish laws governing cross-border crime or compeleither side to enforce the substance of the laws agreed on for this purpose.Thus, while the codified Leges Marchiarum was the product of cooperation betweengovernments, like all such agreements, it had no government to create or enforceits terms.Codified border law didn't replace the customary law that preceded it. It simplyenshrined these customs in writing, including changes to these customs thatevolved over time.12 We know this because the written Leges Marchiarumexplicitly identifies its basis in the ancient customary usage of the borderpeople, “that Heavy Yoke which hung so long upon the Necks of their Ancestors”(Nicolson 1747 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos837005]:A). The written versions we have refer repeatedly to “the ancient Laws andCustoms of the Borders” (Nicolson 1747[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos837005]: 79–80).13The first written version of the Leges Marchiarum was set down in 1249 andperiodically altered or amended and reconfirmed by both sides until the lastwritten version in 1597, which governed intergroup crimes until the Union of theCrowns in 1603. The Leges Marchiarum spanned more than three centuries andunderwent numerous changes over that period. My discussion focuses primarily onthe laws of the Marches as they existed during the second half of the sixteenthcentury. Even during this much shorter time period, however, border lawexperienced substantial alterations that are impossible to recount fully here. Itherefore consider only “snapshots” of this law at particular points in timewith a view to analyzing some of its core, general features.The Leges Marchiarum regulated all aspects of cross-border interaction,including killing, wounding, and maiming; robbery or theft; “over swearing” –falsely declaring the value of goods stolen or otherwise perjuring oneself;seeking unapproved revenge against a transgressor; arson; farming, pasturingcattle, felling trees, or hunting/fishing through trespass; entering into theother realm without permission; receiving and harboring outlaws from the otherrealm; taking “unlawful prisoners;” impeding a warden; bawling and reproaching;and breaching assurance at days of truce.In light of the reiving system, laws dealing with physical violence and theftwere especially important. Early border law relied on a form of wergild, calledmanbote, which required any person convicted of unjustified cross-border killingto financially compensate, or to enter himself as a prisoner to, his victim'sfamily (Neville 1998[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos836588]: 6). In thelatter case the victim's family had the option of executing the aggressor or,more profitably, ransoming him to his relatives. According to the LegesMarchiarum circa 1398, for instance, if an inhabitant from one realm engaged in“slauchteris or mutilatioun” against an inhabitant of the other, his wardendelivered him to the injured party (or his kin in the event of murder) on theother side of the border to “sla or raunsoum at thair lyking” (Rymer 1739[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos842768]–1745: vol. 3, pt.4, 150).14Manbote was barbaric. But it was also efficient. Costs the law imposed onaggressors were enjoyed as benefits by aggressors’ victims. This contrasts withmodern, state-based criminal punishments, such as execution or imprisonment,which often impose costs on criminals that victims don't correspondingly enjoyas benefits (Friedman 1979[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812839]).15Mid-sixteenth-century border law moved away from straight manbote to capitalpunishment. Notably, however, the new law retained many of its efficiencyproperties from the earlier law by retaining a manbote element. In addition topunishing murderers with death, the 1556 law, for example, also required “allthe moveable goodes of the committor or committors of any slaughter orslaughters in tyme comminge be tayne…to the use and profit of the wife andchildren” of the victim, “and in default of the wife and children, to the nextof his or their blood” (Armstrong 1883[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos794202]: 28).16Border law treated other forms of illegitimate cross-border violence similarly,punishing legal violations in ways that converted aggressors’ costs intovictims’ benefits. According to the Leges Marchiarum circa 1553, for example, ifan aggressor “mutylate and maymed” a border inhabitant in the opposite realm,his warden was to deliver him to the opposite warden to be held in “straightPrison” for six months. However, in addition, any borderer who “shall unlawfullybodily hurt or wound any of the Subjects of the other Realm…shall [pay]…theDamage so being set and esteemed to be two doubles, as in the case of Theft andSpoil is used, and deliverance to be made to the Warden of the Marche where theparty grieved inhabiteth, to be kept with him until redress be made thereofaccordingly” (Nicolson 1747[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos837005]: 80).Analogous rules applied to theft, though later incarnations emphasized directfinancial compensation as opposed to ransoming the aggressor (Bowes 1551[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos800761]: ff. 84, 84b):> If any of the subjectes of ether realme, ether by violence or force, robbe or> spoyle the goodes or cattalles of any subjectes of the opposyte realme, or by> night or day steale the goodes of any suche subjecte forthe oof the sayd> opposite realme upon the complaynantes herof tryed and founde to be trewe, the> offendour or offendours shall redresse or restore unto the partie offended the> dooble and sallfye of such goodes or cattelles as were them ether robbed,> spoyled, or stolen.17The term “dooble and sallfye” in this passage refers to borderers’ custom ofcompensation. It entailed twice the value of what was stolen, plus compensationfor the time and trouble of the victim equal to the value of the item, makingtotal compensation due equal to three times the stolen goods’ value (Bowes 1551[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos800761]: ff. 84b, 85).18Border inhabitants commonly used this formula, also variously called “two doubleand sawfey” and “doble and salffie,” to determine fines and penalties.The double-and-sawfey rule speaks to two important concerns that often ariseregarding self-governing systems. These are that such systems will evolvedraconian punishments in response to victims’ demands for retribution, and thatthe resulting criminal law, having no formal mechanism for enforcingpunishments, will go unenforced.Rather than being draconian, as the double-and-sawfey custom suggests, borderlaw developed a more efficient proportionality of punishment practice. Ifpunishments are excessive and independent of the magnitude of the crimecommitted, marginal deterrence is undermined. In contrast, proportionality,which the Leges Marchiarum enshrined, retains a penalty substantial enough todeter some crime, but simultaneously ensures that criminal penalties for moreminor infractions aren't so costly as to encourage more egregious infractions.The moderation of the double-and-sawfey compensation rule also suggests thatcross-border criminals were often brought to justice under border law (I discusshow later). If few criminals were brought to justice because of enforcement'sineffectiveness, to make the expected punishment of committing a crimesufficient to deter it, the stipulated penalty would need to be very large tooffset the extremely low probability of its enforcement. The moderation ofborder law punishment thus suggests that in many – albeit, for reasons Iconsider later, not all – cases, this law was enforced.Hot Trod, Cold Trod, Hue and CryThe border justice system provided mechanisms for restitution for cross-borderthefts under the law just described. However, as is often the case with recourseto adjudication, the wheels of justice could grind slowly. In many cases oftheft, if action was prompt, it was possible to recover stolen property andapprehend the criminals without delay simply by counter-riding on the banditswith one's own posse. To prevent this from degenerating into simple reprisalraids that would only exacerbate intergroup conflict, certain regulations onsuch self-help were important.To empower self-help but prevent its abuse, the Leges Marchiarum establishedspecific rules for how the victim of a reiving expedition on one side of theborder could proceed against his raiders on the other side. The primaryinstitution for this purpose was called “hot trodd.” Under this institution avictim of robbery could pursue his thief into the opposite realm to recover hisstolen goods with deadly force. If he caught his thief “reed hand,” the pursuercould execute him on the spot. Alternatively, and more profitably, however, hemight ransom the thief to his clan. According to the Leges Marchiarum circa 1549(Nicolson 1747 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos837005]:63–64):> If any the Subjects…have stolen any thing, or things, or committed any> Attempts within the Marches of Land of the other Prince…and, after the said> Theft so committed, flying, doth return to the Marches or Land to whom he is> subject, it shall be lawful for him, against whom it hath been so done and> attempted, freely (within six days, to be accounted from the time of the said> Fault so committed or attempted)…to enter safely and freely the Marches or> Land into which the same Evil-doer is gone; so that so soon as he hath enter'd> the said Marches or Land for that case, he go unto some honest Man, being of> good Name and Fame, inhabiting in the Marches which he hath enter'd, and> declare unto him the Cause of his Entry: That is to say, to follow his Goods> stolen.As part of the hot trod, pursuers sometimes used a “hue and cry,” sounding theirhorns to announce the trod and rally others to their aid. Border law permitted“Parties grieved to follow their lawful Trodd with Hound and Horn, with Hue andCry and all other accustomed manner of fresh Pursuit, for the Recovery of theirGoods spoiled” (Nicolson 1747[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos837005]: 89). Tofacilitate the recovery process, addenda to the law prevented interference withanother's trod (Bowes 1551[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos800761]: ff. 86, 86b; seealso, Lansdowne 1450[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos824740]–1500: No. 262):> If any man interrupte suche persone in his saide pursute, he shall answerre> hym to the bill of goodes spoyled or taken. And onely for the troublance of> the partie spoyled in his trod (as the termes of the border be) the trobler> shall be condempned to make redresse to the partie of his goodes stolen or> spoyled with doble and salffie as aforne is mentioned.19Additional amendments required individuals in pursuit of hot trod to notify thefirst person or community they encountered on the opposite side of the borderthat they were in pursuit of trod and stipulated punishment for those whorefused to help pursuers track down their stolen goods. By requiring pursuers todeclare their purpose and intentions in the neighboring country, the first ofthese amendments created a way for March inhabitants to determine whetherindividuals were pursuing cross-border justice under the Leges Marchiarum orinitiating intergroup crime. By requiring domestic inhabitants to aidinternational trod pursuers against cross-border criminals, the second createdintergroup reciprocity and facilitated intergroup cooperation in the pursuit ofinternational lawbreakers.In addition to hot trod, the Leges Marchiarum provided for a “cold trodd” – anysuch pursuit taking place after six days. Cold trod operated similarly butrequired warden approval. Using deadly force to apprehend or punish the thief inthis case was also a shakier proposition and could lead to punishment for theexecutor. The longer an individual waited to recover his stolen property, themore doubt emerged about whether he was in fact recovering stolen property ormounting a thieving expedition himself. To prevent this, and thus minimize thechances for a violent outbreak between opposing borderers, cold trod rulesrestricted pursuers more than hot trod.The rules of the Leges Marchiarum distinguished between trod, which mightinvolve justified killing, and straight revenge. This line was often unclear,but at least in principle, border law permitted the former and prohibited thelatter. Similarly, the trod institution didn't license pursuers to slaughterinnocents on the opposite side of the border. Doing either could jeopardize aborderer's ability to pursue his goods, or worse yet, result in charges againsthim at the “day of truce.”Days of TruceThe day of truce was an ingenious court institution the borderers developed toask violators of border law to answer for their offenses and to resolvecross-border conflicts. According to custom, wardens from either side of theborder held prearranged meetings “at a sett daie and place indifferent” tosettle their inhabitants’ disputes (The Border Papers 1585: vol. 1, no. 343).20Wardens announced an upcoming day of truce in their Marches in market towns oneither side of the border. Borderers with grievances against those in theopposite realm then notified their alleged offenders of their intent to file a“bill of complaint” at the day of truce, a process called “arresting.”Alternatively, a grieved borderer could notify his warden, who then sentnotification of intent to “arrest” an inhabitant of the other realm to thisinhabitant's warden.Customary proceedings on the day of truce highlight the delicate status ofAnglo-Scottish relations in the late medieval period resulting from the factthat these two groups were enemies, as well as how these proceedings developedto ameliorate this tension. Days of truce involved hundreds, and sometimesthousands, of individuals from both sides of the border (Tough 1928[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos850115]: 144). As thefirst order of the day, each warden took an oath to proceed on the day of trucehonestly and amicably, to “speir, fyill, and deliver upone his honour, he shallsearche, enquire, and redrese the samin at his uttirmost power” (Rymer 1739[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos842768]–1745: vol. 6, pt.4, 120; see also, Nicolson 1747[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos837005]: 88).21 Afterthis the wardens created English and Scottish juries called “assizes” or“inquests” to hear their fellow borderers’ bills of complaint.22 The Englishwarden selected six Scottish jury members and the Scottish warden chose sixEnglish jury members.This jury selection process was an institutional response to the distrust andanimosity each side felt toward the other, which facilitated cooperation betweenmembers of enemy groups in applying cross-border justice. The custom of eachside selecting the other's jurors created the conditions required to apply atit-for-tat strategy. This provided strong incentives for “reasonableness” onboth sides’ part, given that if one side selected the other sides’ jurorsunfairly, the other side could reciprocate with its own unfair selection,leveling an otherwise stacked jury.Both sides also agreed to basic rules governing the selection of jurors to helpensure a fair selection and, as I discuss later, to coordinate enforcement ofthe border law that punished lawbreakers by diminishing or eliminating theirstanding and protection under the law. For example, “No tratour, murderer,fugitive, infamous person, convict upon assize, nor betrayer of one parte orother” was “allowed to passe on any assize, to beare any office, not to beareany witnes, but only good and lawfull men deserving credite and unsuspected”(Lansdowne 1450[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos824740]–1500: No. 263, f.4b, No. 9).23As the Leges Marchiarum circa 1553 described the day of truce process, anyonewith a grievance against a party from the other realm shall> make a Bill of Complaint upon the persons so offending them at the days of> Trewes; and the party Offender to be arrested to answer such Bill, and be> compelled to answer thereto after like manner as is used by Robbers, Thieves,> and Spoilers; and such like proof and Tryal to be had, of every behalf, until> either the Bill be acquitted or fyled, and the Damage thereof to be set down> by six Gentlemen of Worship and Good Name of Scotland, to be named by the> warden of England; and other six like Gentlemen of England to be named by the> Warden of Scotland. (Nicolson 1747> [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos837005]: 80)All assize members took oaths pledging to uphold border law: “Yow shall cleareno bills worthie to be filed, yow shall fyle no bill worthie to be cleared, butshall doe that which appeareth with a truth for the maintenance of peace andsuppressing of attempts. So helpe you Gode, &c.” (Bell 1605[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos797395]).24 The wardensthen looked over their bills of complaint and agreed on how many to settle thatday. To preserve the slate-cleaning nature of the day-of-truce process and toavoid upsetting the delicate balance of intergroup relations, they made aneffort to hear an equal number of bills from each side (Fraser 1995[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812492]).25The English assize heard the Scottish bills of complaint and the Scottish assizethe English bills of complaint. This cross-hearing of complaints provided anadditional check on the honesty and reasonableness of both sides similar to thecustom of cross-selecting the assize members.26 If an assize acquitted anindividual, he was “cleared.” If it found him culpable, the bill was called“fyled” and the guilty “foull.” Arrested individuals who didn't appear at theday of truce were “fyled condytionally, which meant, if he, at the next daye oftrewce, be not redy lawfully to answerre the sayd compleynante against hym, andto excuse his former defaulte, he shalbe adjuged culpable or foull by his owndefaulte” (Bowes 1551[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos800761]: f. 86).27 Afterdeciding the bills, the sides exchanged prisoners in cases where border lawcalled for the delivery of offenders to the opposite warden, wardens set up thenext day of truce, saluted and embraced each other, and the participantsdeparted.Enforcing Border LawAn obvious potential problem plagued cross-border dispute resolution: refusal tocomply with day of truce decisions or otherwise participate in the justiceprocess established by the Leges Marchiarum.28 What ensured that an arrestedindividual would appear at the day of truce for his trial? If an arrestedborderer didn't appear, he was conditionally filed – found guilty fornonappearance unless he appeared at the next day of truce with a legitimateexcuse for his absence. But being filed by the assize would mean little for aborderer if he could perpetually avoid justice by never attending a subsequentday of truce. Furthermore, what if a fouled borderer refused to pay thecompensation required by border law? If day-of-truce decisions couldn't beenforced, the system of cross-border criminal law was threatened, and with itsuccessful self-governance.Borderers used several mechanisms to ensure participation in days of truce andcompliance with day-of-truce decisions. The first of these was bonds, which theborderers called “borowis” or pledges. If, for instance, an accused party didn'tappear on the day of truce as he promised during the arresting process, hiswarden delivered a human hostage to the other side until he did.29In principle bonds could be any member of the accused individual's social group– his fellow countrymen. In practice a subset of this larger group – his familymembers and fellow clan members – typically performed this role. Bonds weren'talways used in an ex post fashion. To ensure that arrested individuals appearedat impending days of truce, wardens sometimes also sought accused borderers’bonds – members of their family or clan – ex ante, who were released when theiraccused relatives appeared at the day of truce.Immediate family or clan members provided the stronger bond, because failure toappear at a day of truce jeopardized the fate of an individual's loved ones ormembers of his closest support network. However, fellow countrymen bonds alsoprovided an incentive to appear at days of truce, because borderers lived amongtheir group members, including the bond's family. These persons could exertconsiderable pressure on their noncompliant compatriots to attend days of truceto which they were summoned per border law.Borderers also used bonds to produce compensation from fouled parties who lackedthe means to repay their victims. In this case the fouled party himself mightenter the custody of the aggrieved or his warden at the day of truce until hispayment was forthcoming. Or he might be able to cajole a family member to takehis place for this purpose instead.Borderers similarly used bonds to ensure compliance with assize decisions. If afouled individual didn't satisfy the assize's decision by the next day of truce,> The Wardens of both Marches (at the next day of Trewes ensuing or following> the Fileing of the said Bills) shall make Deliverance of such other Persons,> by the Assent of the Opposite Warden; as he will undertake to be sufficient> for the said Bill. The Person so delivered, to remain with the Party offended> until he be fully satisfied, and lawfully and fully redressed, according to> Justice, and the Laws of the Marches. (Nicolson 1747> [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos837005]: 73)30In addition to family, clan, or fellow country members, professional bondsmenalso performed this role (Fraser 1995[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812492]). Professionalbondsmen were hostages for hire. By permitting a market for human hostages assureties, the border system ensured that this mechanism for enforcing border lawwas carried out relatively cheaply. Because fouled borderers who valued theirfreedom more highly could compensate their victims by purchasing the services ofother individuals who valued their freedom less highly to fulfill the bondingfunction, victims (or their wardens) secured their bonds at a lower social cost.Bonds were helpful in enforcing the Leges Marchiarum. They created a strongincentive to participate in, and comply with, day-of-truce decisions. But theydidn't provide a bulletproof remedy. For example, if a fouled borderer hired aprofessional bondsman to be delivered to the aggrieved in his stead while heaccumulated the repayment he owed, what prevented him from stopping the processthere? Why repay the victim? The victim had his bond, and could ransom orexecute him if the fouled borderer defaulted on compensation. Unless theprofessional bondsman was a fellow group member, the fouled borderer had littleincentive to make good on his promise. And on the other side of the transaction,what compelled bond recipients to release bonds once their offenders hadcompleted compensation?To deal with these problems and strengthen compliance with the Leges Marchiarummore generally, borderers employed a peculiar custom called “bawling.” Bawlingprovided a means to reproach noncompliant individuals publicly. Sir RobertBowes, warden of the East and Middle English Marches, described this practice asfollows (1551: f. 83b):> Thais, if anye Englisheman or Scottesman be bounde to another of the opposite> realme for ransomes, entry of prysoners, or any other just cause, for whiche> he byndethe hym by his faythe and truthe, and dothe not accordingly perfourme> and accomplishe the same, after reasonable monytions thereof given to the> partie, and request to perfourme his sayde bande and promyse, it hate bene> used between the realmes that the partie offended wolde beare a glove or a> picture of hym [on the tip of one's sword] that had so broken his truthe, and,> by the blast of a horne, or crye, to give knowledge to the hole assembly that> suche a person is an untrue and unfaithfull man of his promysse, to his> reproch, which is as muche in the lawe of armes as to give unto hym the lye,> and appealle to fight with hym in the quarrell, and, indede, the partie soe> reproched may (if he will) defende his cause and truthe by singuler battaille,> which the other partie can not honestly refuse.31In this manner borderers denounced and shamed any man who “crakit his creddence”along the frontier (Leslie 1888[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos827193]–1895: 101).32 Thepractice of publicly questioning one's honor and challenging him to a customary,duty-bound duel served as an important check on borderer compliance. Individualsused it most widely at days of truce to call out those who had broken theirpromises of repayment, bonding, and so on.33Bawling's reliance on dueling reduced the potential for large-scale, intergroupviolence between borderers – a critical feature in light of Anglo-Scottishenmity. As Posner (1996[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos838452]: 1737) pointsout, in the absence of government for enforcing social rules, dueling may be anefficient enforcement mechanism because it “prevents disputes from explodinginto feuds by formalizing and channeling the means of enforcement.” TheAnglo-Scottish borderlands, which had no government to create or enforce lawsgoverning intergroup interactions and which were home to individuals with apenchant for feuding, were precisely the sort of environment in which duelingwould be efficient.34Beginning in 1553, an amendment to the Leges Marchiarum required wardenpermission for “bauchling and reproving” at days of truce: “no Person or Personsof either said Realms, shall, at any Day of Trewes…bear, shew or declare anysign or token of Reproof or Baughling against any Subject of the opposite Realm,unless he be thereunto licensed by the Wardens of both the Realms” (Nicolson1747 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos837005]: 81). Thisamendment was to ensure that overzealous bawling didn't create disorder at daysof truce. “Reproofing” without permission resulted in the acquittal of theindividual charged with not fulfilling his promise.35No doubt at least partly because of the prospect of bawling, despite theirpreoccupation with reiving, border inhabitants took their promises seriously.“Infamy fell on any Borderer who broke his word, even to any enemy” (Tough 1928[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos850115]: 36).Consequently, although “they would not care to steal…yet they would not bewray aman that trust in them for all the gold in Scotland and France” (Sadler 1809[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos842928]).36 Testimonyfrom border observer John Leslie, Bishop of Ross, suggests this as well.“[H]aving once pledged their faith, even to an enemy,” he remarked, “they arevery strict in observing it, insomuch that they think nothing can be moreheinous than violated fidelity.” In the words of one English warden of the Eastand later Middle Marches, the border reivers “will rather lose their lives andlivings, than go back from their word, and break the custom of the Border”(Fraser 1995 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812492]:45).The Leges Marchiarum regulated and limited cross-border violence. But theydidn't eliminate it. The first factor contributing to some violence'spersistence was imperfect enforcement. Enforcement under the Leges Marchiarumcouldn't have been wholly ineffective given that, as previously discussed, thepunishments stipulated under its terms weren't exorbitant. But neither couldhave enforcement been perfect, or there wouldn't have been any violence, whichthere was.Enforcement was imperfect for several reasons. First, some corruption plaguedthe Anglo-Scottish Marches. If, for example, a member of a powerful clanviolated the Leges Marchiarum, but this clan was important to his March warden –for instance, because the warden was also a member of his clan, or because theclan supported the warden in some other capacity – the warden might do his bestto avoid bringing this borderer to justice at the day of truce. The corruptwarden could, for example, swear an oath of the accused borderer's innocence,officially excuse his absence at the day of truce, or otherwise help get theaccused borderer off the hook in answering for his crime. Second, the arrestingprocess itself was crude, and wardens didn't always have the time, energy, orresources required to track down an accused borderer or even one of his clanmembers to hold in his stead.Another reason some cross-border violence persisted despite the Leges Marchiarumsystem was the difficulty of extracting full compensation from violators and, asa result, fully compensating victims in a timely fashion. While in principledays of truce were held monthly, in practice, sometimes long periods couldelapse between them. This was most likely to occur in the period immediatelypreceding the outbreak of official warfare between England and Scotland, duringwar itself, or immediately following war's conclusion, when cooperation betweenwardens turned to hostility. When days of truce were suspended, cross-bordercrimes couldn't be addressed until days of truce recommenced. Lawbreakers thusenjoyed additional time without facing punishment and victims incurred the costof a longer wait before receiving justice.An additional factor contributing to delayed compensation was a filed borderer'sinability to come up with compensation. Human hostages, which could be ransomed,and bawling helped reduce this problem. But they did so imperfectly. There wasno guarantee, for instance, that in the event a hostage had to be ransomed hewould fetch a price sufficient to offset fully the victim's loss or sufficientto equal the payment stipulated by the Leges Marchiarum.Further, recall that at days of truce wardens made an effort to hear an equalnumber of complaints from each side so as not to upset the delicate balance ofAnglo-Scottish relations. This helped preserve the slate-cleaning nature of theday of truce process. But it also meant that if one side had accumulated morebills of complaint than the other side since the last day of truce, the next dayof truce might be put off until the balance was equalized.According to Fraser (1995[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812492]: 163), togetherthese factors meant that borderers sometimes had to wait years beforelawbreakers actually incurred their punishments and victims actually receivedcompensation. Delayed compensation operated to shrink the effective cost ofcrime for the aggressor and shrink the effective compensation for crime receivedby the victim, reducing the Leges Marchiarum's effectiveness in addressingcross-border crime.Finally, and perhaps most important, some violence persisted under theborderers’ system of self-governance because many borderers derived utility fromthe act of reiving itself. These borderers didn't desire the elimination ofviolence. It's therefore unsurprising that scope for some violence remained, andindeed was permitted by the system itself.The Leges Marchiarum wasn't the only mechanism of self-governance that helpedreduce and control cross-border violence in the Anglo-Scottish Marches. Severalother mechanisms aided this purpose as well. For example, to bring potentiallylong-lasting and bloody feuds to a faster and more peaceful conclusion,competing clans sometimes intermarried their members, placing once-hostileborderers on cooperative terms with one another. Officially, both England andScotland prohibited cross-border intermarriage. But this prohibition wasdifficult to enforce, especially in the face of the peace-promoting effects ithad for border inhabitants.Through such intermarriage “‘international families’ like the Grahams” extendedacross the Anglo-Scottish border (Fraser 1995[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812492]: 65). Thisintermingling had another conflict-reducing effect for some borderers: it dulledthe otherwise sharp distinction between Englishman and Scotsman. Intermarriagefunctioned as a costly social-distance-reducing investment of the kind describedin the previous essay. As a result of such investments, an English wardencomplained of border “people that wilbe Scottishe when they will, and Englisheat theire pleasure” (The Border Papers 1583: vol. 1, no. 197). In this wayintermarriage contributed to the ambivalent attitude some borderers displayedtoward citizenship and facilitated the idea of a “border people,” distinct fromeither English or Scottish citizenship, which reduced intergroup mistrust andhostility.Cross-border intermarriage and fuzzy views about citizenship help explain whythe more numerous English borderers didn't simply annihilate their less populousScottish neighbors. Together with the Leges Marchiarum, they also help explainwhy cross-border violence, though present, didn't decimate the border populationover years of conflict and hostility. If reiving was continually killing offlarger numbers of men and women, we would expect the population on one or bothsides of the border to decline precipitously over time. A dearth of populationdata prevents a direct evaluation of this issue. However, we know at the veryleast that violence wasn't so rampant as to have brought the border populationto ruins since at the end of the sixteenth century it was nearly 170,000 personsstrong (Tough 1928[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos850115]: 26–28).At least one other mechanism of self-governance helped reduce cross-borderviolence: the discipline of continuous dealings between the English and Scottishgovernments. It didn't behoove the English crown, for instance, to send soldiersto the border to exterminate the Scottish borderers. Neither government careddeeply about the welfare of its March inhabitants, but because the border regionwas strategically important to both, a move such as this by the English crownwould have simply prompted the Scottish crown to repopulate its border, perhapssending along with these new citizens an army sufficient to exterminate theEnglish Marches. Recognition of this fact likely prevented both governments fromoverzealously attacking the border inhabitants of the other.In 1603 England and Scotland joined together under a single monarch. The Unionof the Crowns signified the end of the Marches, of intergroup anarchy, and ofthe Anglo-Scottish laws of lawlessness. In the early seventeenth century,England disbanded the March wardens and applied its common, formal domestic lawthroughout the old borderlands (renamed the Middle Shires), unifying theformerly separate English and Scottish social groups and drawing theself-governing, Anglo-Scottish intergroup justice system to a close.The English and Scottish border reivers were socially distant enemies. Butrather than this situation preventing institutions of self-governance fromemerging to regulate them, if anything, it seems that these persons’ animosityenhanced the importance of developing a system of self-governance to overseeintergroup interactions, and thus both groups’ incentive to devise institutionsfor limiting their predatory inclinations. The resulting system left ample scopefor border society's members to indulge those inclinations. But the emergenceand operation of intergroup self-governance among English and Scottish hostilesdevoted to violently raiding one another makes what regulation the LegesMarchiarum did manage to achieve that much more remarkable. In 1598 bordervisitor John Udall noted precisely this. “Considering the weakness of theirgovernors,” Udall “did not marvel at the many outrages, factions, thefts, andmurders committed, but rather wondered that there were not many more” (Tough1928 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos850115]: 32).* This chapter is based on and uses material from Leeson, Peter T. 2009. “TheLaws of Lawlessness.” Journal of Legal Studies 38(2): 471–502 [© 2009 TheUniversity of Chicago]. 1 While historians have explored the Anglo-Scottish border (see, for instance,the excellent work by Fraser 1995[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812492]; Neville 1998[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos836588]; Lapsley 1900[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos824838]), economists haveneglected this episode. 2 Additionally, this essay relies on, and is greatly indebted to the work of,contemporary historians who have discussed the border people and their uniqueinternational legal system. See, especially, Fraser (1995[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812492]), Tough (1928[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos850115]), Neville (1998[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos836588]), and Armstrong(1883 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos794202]). 3 As Fraser (1995[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812492]: 30) notes,wardens were really only the “nominal overseers of the community.” Within eachMarch there were domestic courts occasionally used to deal with treason.However, “attempts to enforce the ordinary laws were somewhat intermittent,” andMarch domestic courts met only a few times a year (Tough 1928[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos850115]: 163–164). 4 On various occasions the English king Edward I declared his “overlordship”over Scotland, in effect claiming the right of jurisdiction over certaincross-border conflicts. In a few cases such disputes were adjudicated accordingto English common law in English courts. However, these instances were rare. 5 Nominally, traditional English common law courts remained an option forEnglish borderers seeking justice against cross-border criminals. In practice,however, securing justice against a border inhabitant from the other realm wasexceedingly difficult, if not impossible in many cases, so borderersoverwhelmingly relied on the international justice system created by the LegesMarchiarum. 6 In 1603 the Union of the Crowns placed England and Scotland under the samemonarch. The countries remained separate, each retaining its own parliament andsovereignty in domestic affairs. However, Scotland effectively lost sovereigntyin international affairs, especially those related to England. In 1707 the Actsof Union joined England and Scotland fully, placing them under the sameparliament. 7 In fairness to the border people, some of their notorious cross-borderraiding was instigated, supported, and encouraged by the English and Scottishgovernments, which, as I noted earlier, were frequently in conflict. 8 The practice was officially prohibited in 1587, not long before the union ofEngland and Scotland, but remained widespread. Writing in 1593, for instance,one warden complained of some English gentlemen who paid blackmail to reivers onthe other side of the border, or as he called them, “inconvenient kindnes andassuraunces enterteigned between the gentlemen and the ryding borderers” (TheBorder Papers 1593: vol. 1, no. 893). 9 Carey was one of the few March wardens who actually endeavored to administerhis kingdom's domestic law in his March. 10 The name, Leges Marchiarum, comes from Nicolson (1747[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos837005]) whosecompilation of international border law bears this title. 11 Quoted in Fraser (1995[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812492]: 149). 12 This chapter uses the term “border law” to refer to the system ofinternational law that England and Scotland forged to deal with the problem ofinternational crime. This border law should not be confused with the domesticborder law both England and Scotland established to govern their Marchterritories internally. 13 Some of “the customs contynuallie used on the borders” were “notcomprehended in the foresaid lawes and treatises” (Bell 1605[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos797395]: 6, quoted inTough 1928 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos850115]: 95).Thus the codified Leges Marchiarum is far from complete. 14 Quoted in Armstrong (1883[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos794202]: 27). 15 On the economics of the private enforcement of law, see Becker and Stigler(1974 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos796966]) and Landesand Posner (1975[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos824560]). 16 Any person who harbored such a criminal – an act called “resetting” – wasliable for the same punishment as the actual offender. 17 Quoted in Armstrong (1883[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos794202]: 2). In 1563 theLeges Marchiarum included a three-strikes rule that punished the third offensewith death. The Leges Marchiarum also punished knowing receipt of stolenproperty and declared thief resetters liable for the same punishment as thethieves. 18 Quoted in Armstrong (1883[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos794202]: 32). 19 Quoted in Armstrong (1883[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos794202]: 47). 20 By custom the meeting place was usually somewhere in Scotland. However,Northham ford on the Tweed, Wark, Carharm, Redenburn, Cocklaw, Reideswire,Kershipefoot, and others became focal meeting spots depending on the Marchesinvolved (Fraser 1995[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812492]). 21 Quoted in Armstrong (1883[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos794202]: 19). 22 There were two other ways that bills could be decided: on the honor of thewarden or by admission of the accused. According to the first “manner of triallof any person…the warden shall, upon his owne knowledge confesse the facte andso deliver the partie offending” (The Border Papers 1584: vol. 1, no. 343).After a warden had taken his oath, borderers considered his word sufficient todetermine the veracity of bills of complaint when he had direct knowledge of theguilty. 23 Quoted in Armstrong (1883[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos794202]: 20). 24 Quoted in Tough (1928[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos850115]: 141–142). 25 All complainants took a public oath of honesty for bills they filed to“truth say what your goods were worth at the tyme of their taking to have beensold in a market” (Bell 1605[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos797395], quoted in Tough1928 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos850115]: 142). Inaddition, in 1553 the Leges Marchiarum was amended such that in the event ofsuspected gross overstatement the warden or assize reserved the right to modifythe value considered. 26 As a final mechanism for preventing wrongful convictions, the border trialprocess relied on “vowers.” Vowing meant “confronting of a man of the samenation to averre the fact” of the crime alleged by the victim. The assize'sdecision alone wasn't enough to convict an accused criminal. But if a countrymanof the accused – a vower – would also support the victim's allegation, theconviction was secured. “Then is hee by the law guilty; for except the wardenhim self knowing, shall acknowlege the fact, or a man of the same nation foundthat voluntarilie will avonche it (the ordinarie and onlie waies of triall), bethe facte never so patent, the delinquent is quitt by the lawes of the Borders”(The Border Papers 1585: vol. 1, no. 343). Fraser (1995[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812492]) and Armstrong(1883 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos794202]) both referto vowing as a separate method of trial. However, as Armstrong's discussionindicates, vowing was not really a separate method but rather worked inconjunction with the assize method of trial. 27 Quoted in Armstrong (1883[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos794202]: 17). 28 An additional mechanism of border law enforcement, not discussed here, wasoutlawry. Refusal to make recompense could place one outside the bounds ofborder law, leaving him without the protection against violence established inthe Leges Marchiarum. According to border law circa 1249, this was achievedthrough “Banishment by the Sound of a Trumpet” (Nicolson 1747[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos837005]: 17). A publicdeclaration of outlawry in this fashion communicated the outlaw's status to theborder community, effectively announcing that he and his possessions were fairgame for the taking. 29 In 1563 border law also required lords to ensure that their tenants, ifarrested, appeared per this summons at the day of truce. For failing to do so,such a lord could be found liable for his tenant's crime (but he couldn't beexecuted even if this was the corresponding punishment his tenant shouldreceive). 30 On rare occasions when no suitable bond could be found, the fouledborderer's warden or one of his deputies offered himself for this purpose. 31 Quoted in Armstrong (1883[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos794202]: 58). 32 Quoted in Tough (1928[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos850115]: 105). 33 The following is an example of a duel contract between borderers: “It isagreed between Thomas Musgrave and Lancelot Carleton, for the true trial of suchcontroversies as are betwixt them, to have it openly tried by way of combatbefore God and the face of the world, to try it in Canonby holme before Englandand Scotland, upon Thursday in Easter week, being the 8th day of April nextensuing, A.D. 1602, betwixt nine of the clock and one of the same day; to fighton foot; to be armed with jack, steel cap, plaite sleeves, plaite breeches,plaite frocks, two baselard swords, the blades to be one yard and half a quarterlength, two Scotch daggers or dorks at their girdles; and either of them toprovide armour and weapons for themselves according to the indenture. Twogentlemen to be appointed on the field to view both the parties, to see thatthey both be equal in arms and weapons according to this indenture; and being soviewed by the gentlemen, the gentlemen to ride to the rest of the company, andto leave them but two boys, viewed by the gentlemen to be under 16 years of age,to hold their horses. In testimony of this our agreement, we have both set ourhands to this indenture, of intent all matters shall be made so plain as thereshall be no question to stick upon that day” (Armstrong 1883[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos794202]: 74). 34 For further discussion of the efficiency of dueling as a rule enforcementmechanism under such circumstances, see Schwartz, Baxter, and Ryan (1984[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos843530]). 35 Border law treated perjury at days of truce in a somewhat related fashion. Aperjurer could be imprisoned for three months but, far worse, following histerm, at the next day of truce he was “openly denounced and proclaimed aPerjur'd man; after which time he shall not be reputed to be a Man able to givefurther Faith or Testimony in any Case or Matter” (Nicolson 1747[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos837005]: 83). 36 Quoted in Armstrong (1883[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos794202]: 83)."},{"pageContent":"Part II Self-Governance and the Problem of Violence"},{"pageContent":"4 Trading with Bandits*No sane person would argue that it's possible to trade with bandits. We have alllearned that private institutions alone are insufficient to prevent the strongfrom plundering the weak. Indeed, the threat of violence is perhaps the oldest,most well-accepted justification for government. Even Adam Smith believed thiswas true. As he put it: “It is only under the shelter of the civil magistratethat the owner of…property…can sleep a single night in security. He is at alltimes surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he cannever appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerfularm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it” (Smith 1776[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos846050]: 670).Self-governance, however, might be better at negotiating threats of violencethan conventional wisdom suggests. The border reivers provided some evidence forthis possibility. But in their case, self-governance had much more than ordinarythreats of violence to negotiate. The Anglo-Scottish border population consistedof socially distant persons, many of whom, moreover, were committed to a systemof intergroup violence as a way of life. It's difficult to tell in such anenvironment how much of self-governance's imperfect ability to prevent violencereflects inherent limitations on its ability to do so or rather the fact thatmany of the persons involved enjoyed violence per se. This essay considers anenvironment that isolates the potential for violent theft as the problem thatindividuals under anarchy confront. It examines persons for whom social distancewasn't a pressing issue and for whom violence, as is usually the case, wassolely a potential means rather than also an end.Most discussions of self-governance focus on commitment problems that involvepotential for what might be called peaceful theft in that recourse to physicalviolence isn't used to take advantage of the wronged party. For peaceful theft,a separation of payment and provision, not a difference in actual strength,accounts for an individual's ability to defraud his exchange partner. Equallyimportant when government is absent is what might be called violent theft. Herethe perpetrator is a bandit who uses physical force to overwhelm his victim. Hissuperior strength gives him the ability to deprive others of their property.We have seen that under some conditions, at least, the discipline of continuousdealings can support cooperation in the face of the prospect of peaceful theft.But it's much harder for it to do so in the face of the prospect of violenttheft. The reason is simple: weaker persons can eternally boycott stronger oneswho behave violently toward them, but boycott doesn't prevent stronger personsfrom simply taking what they want from weaker ones.There are exceptions to this statement, of course. If the stronger party isstationary but the weaker one is mobile, boycott can be effective. However, insituations where individuals have disparate strengths and stronger persons aremobile while weaker ones aren't, multilateral punishment breaks down. Weakerindividuals may refuse to interact with stronger ones who behaved violentlytoward them in the past. But if they can't run and stronger individuals can,their refusal won't prevent them from being plundered again. Something otherthan the threat of lost revenue from future interactions is needed to createcooperation.One possible solution to this problem is for physically weaker persons to investin becoming stronger. When both parties can transform their resources intocoercive power, the otherwise weaker party may be able to improve its propertyprotection against stronger ones (see, for example, Bush and Mayer 1974[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos801896]; Umbeck 1981[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos850776]; Hirshleifer 1988[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos818654], 1995[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos818947], 2001[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos819104]; Skaperdas 1992[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos845063], 2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos845475]; Anderson andMcChesney 1994; Anderson and Hill 2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos793588]; Skaperdas andSyropoulos 1997 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos845700];Neary 1997 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos836013];Grossman 1998 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos816128];Grossman and Kim 2002[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos816327]; Bates, Greif,and Singh 2002 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos796472]).1But significantly improving one's strength isn't always an option for weakerparties. For instance, if one party has a monopoly on the technology of greatestviolence, the other may be severely limited in its ability to invest in strengthfor the purpose of defense or aggression. Introducing severe limitations on somepersons’ ability to invest in additional strength leads to a situation in whichthose who aren't so constrained plunder those who are. Permanently weak personscan't avoid violent theft in equilibrium (see, for instance, Hausken 2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos817846]).With both multilateral punishment and investment in greater strength eliminatedas means for coping with the threat of violent theft, it would seem that there'sno way for permanently weak individuals to exchange with stronger ones. Despitethis, this essay demonstrates that trade between permanently weak andpermanently strong individuals without government is indeed possible. Weakerindividuals’ inability to rely on mechanisms described by the discipline ofcontinuous dealings and to invest in force for defense or aggression doesn'tprevent them from making exchange with bandits self-enforcing in the face ofthreats of violent theft.To illustrate this, I examine west-central Africa in the second half of thenineteenth century.2 During this period, European settlers on the west coast ofAfrica employed middlemen to collect the goods they needed for export fromproducers in the remote interior of central Africa.3 In addition, some Africansoperated as middlemen on their own account, connecting European exporters andothers with producers in the interior. Caravans of traveling middlemen werefrequently stronger than the communities of producers with which theyinteracted. They were therefore tempted to overwhelm these communities withforce and steal the goods they desired rather than trading for them.4Communities of producers used two mechanisms of self-governance to transformmiddlemen's equilibrium strategy from banditry to peaceful trade. First, Idiscuss producers’ use of credit as a means of facilitating producer-middlemanexchange relations. Second, I look at producers’ demands for tribute frommiddlemen as a kind of risk premium promoting producers’ ability to interactpeacefully with traveling traders.5To examine these strategies I use primary source materials regarding interactionbetween middlemen and producers in west-central Africa in the latter half of thenineteenth century. These sources consist of in-depth reports from about twentyEuropean travelers to the area during this period. Many of these travelers werethemselves traders, while others were explorers interested in learning moreabout the state of African trade for their home countries and spreading the wordof Christianity.Producer-Middleman Relations in Late Precolonial AfricaThe persons in the anarchic episode this essay considers are thenineteenth-century inhabitants around the Upper Zambezi and Kasai,Portuguese-speaking settlers along the Angolan coast, and the middlemen theyemployed.6 Middlemen typically traveled in caravans and were constantly on themove.7 These caravans consisted of other free middlemen, guards charged withprotecting the caravan on the road, and often a great number of slaves whocarried the items for sale. Caravans ranged in size from tens to thousands ofpersons, but based on the evidence available in travelers’ reports, the modalcaravan consisted of about seventy or eighty people (Miller 1988[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos834484]: 191; Cameron1877 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos802437]: 251;Soremekun 1977 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos847080]:87; Capello and Ivens 1969[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos802580]: vol. 1, 17–18;Dias de Carvalho 1890[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos808580]: 186, 192, 193,700; Harding 1905[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos817006]: 214; Johnston1893 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos822019]: 34).Common imports that traveling traders carried to the interior included tobaccoand gin, beads, shells, and brass used as body ornaments, cloth, and firearms.As the sole suppliers of firearms to interior communities, middlemen controlledthe weaponry reaching producers and thus typically had the upper hand when itcame to implements used in fighting.8Producers consisted of village chiefs/headmen and their citizens in the remoteinterior. These individuals rarely traveled far beyond the bounds of theircommunities where the resources they used in production were found.9Specialization contributed to their stationarity. It was expensive to spendsignificant time away from home, especially given that traveling for the purposeof trade wasn't producers’ comparative advantage. The goods that producerssupplied to middlemen consisted mainly of ivory, beeswax, and wild rubber.Further, even though slave trading was prohibited in Angola in 1836, slaves alsocontinued to be a source of profit to traveling traders who sought them forillegal sale both to coastal traders and to other African communities.10In the nineteenth century most of interior west-central Africa consisted ofscattered communities ruled by chiefs who adjudicated disagreements betweentheir citizens, including those that dealt with credit and exchange. Therelationship between rulers and citizens in these communities was largelyinformal.11 As Livingstone (1963[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829821]: 410) observed,for example, “So far as I can at present understand, there are no such things asnations or kingdoms in the interior of Africa.” Or, in the words of two otherEuropean travelers to the African interior, “it is only in extraordinary casesthat one can suspect that such a thing as a law exists” (Capello and Ivens 1969[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos802580]: vol. 2, 242; seealso, vol. 1, 183).12On the European side, crown-established governors ruled Portuguese settlementson the coast and oversaw trade posts they set up slightly further inland. Thesesettlements’ laws didn't bind Africans in the interior. Nor did interior Africancommunities’ customs bind these settlements’ inhabitants. The result was aformally ungoverned arena involving interactions between them.The Threat of Violent TheftTo profit, middlemen needed to obtain goods from producers in the interior ofcentral Africa and bring them to outlying communities and coastal exporters.They could obtain these goods in two ways: peaceful trade or violent theft. Inconnecting stationary producers with people outside the narrow bounds of theircommunities, middlemen had the capacity to enable producers to realizesignificant gains from exchange they would have been otherwise unable tocapture.13 Unfortunately, the fact that middlemen tended to be stronger than thecommunities of producers they interacted with created a situation in whichmiddlemen were tempted to use force rather than trade to realize their ends(see, for instance, Harding 1905[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos817006]: 93, 108, 124,138; Cameron 1877[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos802437]: 226, 253, 292,331, 472; Johnston 1893[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos822019]: 40–41; Gibbons1904 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos814694]: vol. 1, 67;Livingstone 1874 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829396]:vol. 2, 29; Livingstone 1857[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829242]: 180, 297;Livingstone 1960 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829591]:277; Livingstone 1963[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829821]: vol. 1, 12). AsCameron (1877 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos802437]:393) observed, for example, left unchecked, caravans “profited by rapine androbbery in passing through countries where people did not possess guns.”14 Thusa potentially highly beneficial situation for producers could easily turn into amassively harmful one.Like all behavior, the decision to engage in banditry versus trade is guided bythe relative marginal cost and marginal benefit of these alternative modes ofaction. Sufficiently superior strength lowers the marginal cost of plunder belowthat of trade as a means of obtaining desired goods. Where an individual isstrong enough to take what he wants with little or no resistance, it's cheaperto steal than to pay for the objects of his desire. His payoff-maximizingstrategy is to violently overwhelm weaker individuals.Two features of middlemen accounted for the fact that they were often thestronger force in their interactions with interior producers. First, aspreviously noted, middlemen were producers’ sole source of modern weaponry,namely guns. By controlling the quantity and quality of firearms reachinginterior communities, middlemen could secure their strength superiority, givingthem a decisive advantage should they decide to attack these communities.Heightening this advantage was the fact that, often, “in the interior…thevillages are open and unprotected” (Serpa Pinto 1881[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos844380]: vol. 1, 177).This made producers easy targets for better-armed middlemen. Middlemen's weaponsadvantage wasn't always sufficient to ensure victory if they attacked. If acaravan was sufficiently small and the community it attempted to plunder wassufficiently large, better weaponry was meaningless. But overcoming thispotential obstacle to banditry wasn't hard. Middlemen simply needed to beselective about the communities they attacked.Second, middlemen were highly mobile and producers were highly stationary. Thismeant two things for middleman success in plundering expeditions. On the onehand, middlemen could always return to the coast or their home bases near thecoast and gather additional members if greater numbers were needed to succeed inviolently plundering communities of interior producers. More important,producers’ relative immobility meant middlemen could escape from conflict withtheir booty by fleeing to the coast without concern that bands of producerswould later locate them, track them down, and forcibly recover from them whatthe middlemen had stolen.15Analyzing the Threat of Violent TheftTo understand the threat of violent theft that middlemen posed for producers,it's useful to examine their interactions in the context of a simple game.Consider an economy of complete and perfect information with one community ofproducers and one caravan of middlemen. Because it's stationary and sufficientlyweaker than the caravan of middlemen, the community of producers doesn't have achoice about whether it will interact with the middlemen. If the caravanapproaches the community of producers, the community can't avoid interaction.Thus multilateral punishment, which requires the ability to terminate futureinteraction in the event of uncooperative behavior, isn't an effective strategyfor preventing banditry here. However, the community of producers does control adifferent variable of the game: how much it produces.Producers move first and decide whether to produce for trade or for subsistence.Producing for trade means producing a large quantity of goods that producers mayconsume or trade with the caravan if it approaches them. Producing forsubsistence means producing a small quantity of goods barely larger than whatproducers need for consumption. Production for trade therefore involves asurplus stock of goods that affords producers additional consumption and trade,whereas production for subsistence involves a stock just large enough to sustainthe community and permits only a minimal level of trade.The caravan of middlemen moves second and decides whether to stay home – thatis, to not travel to the community of producers at all – to travel to thecommunity of producers and trade, or to travel to the community of producers andplunder. For reasons described earlier, the caravan's attempt to plunder isalways successful and met without resistance such that the community loses allit has produced when it's plundered.If producers produce for trade and middlemen stay home, producers receive Hp andmiddlemen receive Hm – what each can earn without interacting with the other. Ifmiddlemen trade, both producers and middlemen earn a higher payoff fromexchanging, Ep and Em respectively, where Em is middlemen's payoff net oftraveling expenses. If middlemen plunder, they receive a still higher payoff,which, when travel expenses are deducted, yields them P. Producers, in contrast,receive their lowest payoff in this case, −Hp.The situation is similar if producers produce for subsistence, but the payoffschange because a smaller stock of goods is available for producers to consume,middlemen to violently take if they choose to plunder, and producers to tradewith middlemen if middlemen decide to exchange. Only middlemen's payoff fromstaying home, which is unaffected by the stock of goods producers keep on hand,doesn't change when producers produce for subsistence. Thus if producers producefor subsistence and middlemen stay home, middlemen continue to earn Hm.Producers, however, earn less. Because the inconvenience of producing justenough to sustain the community is costly, producers receive a payoff of onlyhp, where hp is equal to Hp minus the value they place on the foregone stock inconsumptive uses.If middlemen plunder, producers receive −hp, which is their smallest payoff whenthey produce for subsistence but larger than what they receive when middlemenplunder and they produce for trade (−Hp). Middlemen in this case earn p, whichis more than they earn by trading but, because there's so little to steal, issmaller than the payoff of staying home (Hm). Finally, if middlemen trade,producers earn ep, which is smaller than what they earn from trade when theyproduce for trade (because there's a smaller stock available for trading), butstill their highest payoff when they produce for subsistence. Middlemen in thisevent earn em, their smallest payoff, which includes the cost of travel.To summarize, then, for producers: Ep > Hp > ep > hp. And for middlemen: P > Em> Hm > p > em. Ep + Em > P − Hp, which is to say that the higher level of tradeis efficient. Figure 4.1 depicts this game.[images/00001.jpg]Figure 4.1. The Threat of Violent TheftThe unique subgame perfect Nash equilibrium of this game involves producersproducing for subsistence and traveling traders staying home. If producersproduce more, they increase middlemen's payoff from banditry by making moreavailable to steal. This entices middlemen to plunder, generating losses forproducers.To avoid these losses, producers produce only what's needed to sustainthemselves. As a result there's little available for theft, creating a situationfor middlemen in which staying home yields a higher return than plundering. Inequilibrium, producers earn hp and middlemen earn more, Hm. Producers “pay” fortheir strength inferiority by incurring the cost associated with reducing stocksto a level that prevents middlemen from engaging in banditry.In discouraging middlemen from interacting with them, producers also foregosignificant potential gains from trade. However, the threat of being plundereddidn't prevent trade between middlemen and producers in the late precolonialperiod. Indeed, legitimate exports supplied by remote interior producers leavingAngola alone amounted to close to $4 million per year by the end of thenineteenth century (Vellut 1979[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos854454]: 101). How didproducers overcome the threat of violent theft posed by trading with bandits?A Clever Use of CreditTo capture the gains from trade with middlemen, producers required a strategythat could keep middlemen's payoff from plunder below the payoff from stayinghome, like when they produced for subsistence, but raised middlemen's payofffrom trade above the payoff from staying home, like when they produced fortrade. Credit made these two seemingly incompatible goals possible. Althoughmiddlemen couldn't steal goods that didn't yet exist, credit enabled producersto trade with goods that didn't yet exist. You can't steal what's not there, butyou can trade with it. By keeping current stocks low but exchanging withmiddlemen on credit, producers could produce for subsistence, deterring plunder,while still enabling trade, allowing both sides to reap the benefits ofcooperation.To see how the use of credit arrangements enhanced producer-middleman exchange,consider the game in Figure 4.2. This game is like that in Figure 4.1, only nowwhen producers produce for subsistence, middlemen's trade strategy is to tradeon credit rather than simultaneous exchange. This modification makes the gamedynamic. When trade on credit is chosen, each round is composed of twosubperiods: one in which middlemen provide credit and another in which, ifproducers have produced, exchange takes place and, if they haven't, they'replundered to clear off as much of the debt as possible.16[images/00002.jpg]Figure 4.2. A Clever Use of CreditThe payoffs on the Produce for Trade branch of the tree are the same as before.Likewise, the payoffs from {Produce for Subsistence, Stay Home} and {Produce forSubsistence, Plunder} are the same. However, because it now involves trading oncredit, which increases the volume of exchange possible, the payoff of tradeunder subsistence production rises.Because middlemen provide credit in the first subperiod, they only receive whatthey're owed in the second subperiod if producers have produced. If middlemenprovide credit and producers subsequently produce, producers receive the samepayoff as when they produce for trade and middlemen trade under the Produce forTrade branch of the tree, Ep. Middlemen, in contrast, earn δEm, where δ is thecaravan's discount factor and δ ∈ (0, 1).The reason for discounting middlemen's payoff is straightforward. Because tradein this case is conducted on credit in the first subperiod, middlemen onlyreceive all or part of the gains from exchange via repayment in the secondsubperiod. If after receiving credit in the first subperiod the caravan arrivesto receive payment in the second subperiod but producers haven't produced,middlemen punish them by plundering what's available. When this happens,producers receive Ep − δhp: what they received on credit in subperiod one, lessthe discounted value of what's taken from them in subperiod two. Middlemen, incontrast, receive δp: the discounted value of what they're able to take ascompensation in subperiod two.What course of action the caravan of middlemen now finds most profitable dependson its discount rate and the credibility of producers’ promise to produce insubperiod two. Where δ > Hm/Em and producers can credibly commit to produce,trade is more profitable for the caravan than staying home. Where δ doesn'tsatisfy this inequality or producers can't credibly commit to produce, thecaravan finds staying home more profi-table.Because Ep > Ep − δhp for any δ ∈ (0, 1), and Ep > hp > − Hp, producers cancredibly commit to produce for repayment in subperiod two. Given this, formiddlemen whose discount rates satisfy δ > Hm/Em, trading on credit is thepayoff-maximizing strategy. For middlemen whose discount rates don't satisfythis inequality, staying home is payoff maximizing. In equilibrium the caravanonly travels to the community of producers if it's going to trade (on credit),and stays home if it poses a threat of violence. Plunder is avoided andproducers and middlemen who are sufficiently patient realize the gains fromexchange.The use of credit for this purpose in nineteenth-century producer-middlemanexchange was ubiquitous. As the traveling trader Henrique Augusto Dias deCarvalho (1890 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos808580]:700) put it, “[T]he trader sees himself forced to give credits, and this isindispensable for anyone who takes the risk of trading in such a region, if hewants to do it with any success.”17 Producers’ efforts to keep stocks ofthievable goods low was eased considerably by the fact that the main goodsmiddlemen desired – for instance, ivory, rubber, and wax – required harvestingbefore they were available in exportable form. These goods remained in theground, so to speak, until producers collected them.To keep stocks perpetually low, producers protracted the debt repayment process(see, for instance, Cameron 1877[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos802437]: 47; Livingstone1874 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829396]: vol. 1,305; Dias de Carvalho 1890[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos808580]: 699). Considerthe observation of European traveler to the Upper Zambezi and Kasai, Paul Pogge(1880 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos838335]: 16):> The native would be little inclined to gather the products of his country,> were he not given the payment in advance…[Ambaquista middlemen – A.v.O.] can> buy some products in the interior, these being brought to them by the natives> and paid [immediately].…In general, however, they cannot purchase very many> commodities in this way but instead give the native credit. Where rubber> occurs in the forest, and where the elephant occurs, the Baptist [Ambaquista]> gives payment in advance to the elephant hunter for so and so many tusks, and> to the one who wants to bring rubber or beeswax payment for so and so many> pounds of rubber or wax. These people then have to wait for months and years> until their debtors satisfy them [emphasis added].18The goods producers desired that middlemen extended to them on credit – forinstance, alcohol, cloth, and tobacco – were typically the kind producersconsumed shortly after receiving them. Thus middlemen weren't able to extendgoods to producers on credit and then retake them by force when they returned toa village to receive an installment of debt repayment. Obviously, however,producers couldn't reduce their stocks of goods to zero. They needed to keepsome provisions on hand to survive. Additionally, some goods traveling tradersdesired – for instance, slaves – couldn't be made unavailable in the way thatothers could. Consequently, there was always something available for strongermiddlemen to steal if they wanted.Still, by significantly reducing their holdings, producers could concomitantlyreduce violent theft's benefit for middlemen bent on banditry. Moreover, it wasunnecessary for producers to reduce their stock of goods to zero to have thedesired effect. As long as producers kept stocks low enough such that the valueof the goods available for plunder was lower than middlemen's payoff fromtrading on credit, middlemen would trade with producers rather than plunderthem.The pattern of historical references to middleman-producer credit agreementsclosely tracks the declining importance of slaves and the rising importance ofivory, rubber, and wax from the 1840s and 1850s onward, following the abolitionof Angolan slave trading in 1836 and then slavery itself in 1858. In the firsthalf of the nineteenth century credit agreements are rarely mentioned.19 In thesecond half of the century they're common. This reflects the fact that, aspreviously pointed out, the credit mechanism wasn't especially effective inpreventing plunder by middlemen seeking slaves, but was highly effective inpreventing plunder by middlemen seeking other goods.While the game presented earlier is bilateral, in actuality multiple caravans ofmiddlemen interacted with multiple communities of producers.20 The presence ofmultiple communities of producers and caravans introduced the possibility of onecaravan plundering the goods producers harvested to repay another caravan aspart of a previous credit agreement. However, it seems unlikely that caravanscould have pursued this strategy effectively, for two reasons. First, for suchtheft to be effective, caravans would require specific knowledge of when thegoods produced to repay other caravans were available for stealing before theyhad been collected. Second, caravans had strong incentives to ensure that othercrews of middlemen wouldn't plunder the goods owed to them. The use of creditcreated a stake for middlemen in producers’ well-being. By indebting themselvesto middlemen, producers transformed their status in these traders’ eyes fromtargets of violence to productive assets. To produce the goods necessary torepay their debts, producers needed to be alive and well. So it was inmiddlemen's interest to ensure the health and safety of those to whom they madeloans. One way middlemen protected their valued investments was by punishingother middlemen who wronged them. For example, according to Arnot (1889[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos794406]: 179), “threeGarganze caravans had been plundered and many men killed – one at Bihe, anotherin the Lovale country, the third in the Lunda country, but all at theinstigation of Bihe chiefs and traders, who thought that they had been unjustlydealt with in certain business transactions they had with Msidi.”It's not clear whether some caravans were able to establish monopoly controlover some areas. Securing an effective monopoly would require a significant andlasting strength disparity between caravans such that stronger caravans couldforcibly exclude potential competitors from trading with particular villages.Such a disparity may have existed in some instances, but it clearly didn't inmany others. A monopoly caravan would create less favorable terms of trade forproducers. In principle, monopoly middlemen could get away with paying producersjust above their payoff of producing for subsistence and not trading on credit(producers’ equilibrium payoff from Figure 4.1). Thus, if competition wereabsent, it would be reasonable to expect poor bargaining power among producersand near-subsistence wages. However, the historical record indicates that, forsome producers at least, just the opposite prevailed. As one traveler complainedabout villagers he encountered, for instance, “the people being satiated withcloth, owing to their constant intercourse with the coast, would sell usnothing, or asked higher prices than we could afford” (Cameron 1877[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos802437]: 390).Tribute as a Risk PremiumIn communities where producers held wealth predominantly in the form of humans(slaves) and livestock, producers were constrained in their ability to reducethe size of their thievable stocks. As long as those stocks weren't so large asto make banditry more profitable than trading on credit regardless of acaravan's discount rate, sufficiently patient caravans continued to find tradingon credit the most profitable course of action. To see this, consider acommunity that, because it holds much of its wealth in the form of humans andlivestock, can't reduce its stock of goods as low as others who don't hold mostof their wealth in these forms. The benefit of plundering this community istherefore higher, Ψ, where Ψ > Hm. Despite this, if Ψ < Em, there exists somecaravan that will continue to find the payoff from trading on credit (δEm)greater than the payoff from plundering (Ψ). Specifically, where Hm < Ψ < Em,caravans with discount rates that satisfy δ > Ψ/Em will trade on credit.However, caravans with discount rates where δ < Ψ/Em won't. In fact, because Ψ >Hm, some caravans that would rather stay home than trade on credit withproducers who can reduce their stock of thievable goods sufficiently wouldrather plunder producers who can't do this than stay home. For these middlemen,banditry is the most profitable course of action. Thus, while producers whocould reduce their stocks sufficiently were safe from plunder and could tradewith bandits, those who held their wealth in the form of humans and livestockcouldn't. Sufficiently patient middlemen would trade with them on credit, butimpatient ones would plunder them.To address this problem, communities of vulnerable producers demanded tributefrom traveling traders who approached them for exchange. Typically communityheadmen were gatekeepers to their community's producers and required middlemento meet their tribute demands before they would consummate trade relations.21 Asthe prominent middleman Antonio Francisco Ferreira da Silva Porto (1885[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos844766]: 580) recorded,tribute payment “was necessary to open the door!’ We tried to find the solutionto this enigma and found out that it was necessary to give some pannos [yards ofcloth – A.v.O.] to obtain permission for the people of the caravan and of thecountry to buy and sell provisions and other commodities, without which nothingcould be done.”22The way tribute worked is straightforward. Suppose that caravans of middlemenare heterogeneous in discount rates such that ρ is the proportion of caravanswith discount rates that satisfy δ > Ψ/Em and 1 − ρ is the proportion ofcaravans with discount rates that don't satisfy this inequality. If a caravan ofmiddlemen was excessively impatient and so intended to plunder a community,demanding tribute was worthless. The stronger caravan would simply overwhelm thecommunity, refuse tribute payment, and go about violently stealing what itdesired. For those caravans that weren't too impatient, however, demandingtribute was effective. These middlemen found peaceful exchange more profitablethan plunder and so were willing to pay for the opportunity to trade.Where producers can't reduce their stocks sufficiently and the resulting benefitfrom plunder is Ψ, their expected payoff of producing for subsistence andtrading on credit is ρ(Ep) + (1 − ρ)(－hp), which is greater than producers’expected payoff of producing for subsistence and not trading on credit for any ρ> 0. Sufficiently patient middlemen earn δEm > Ψ when producers agree to tradeon credit and Ψ when they don't. Because of this, producers could demand tributeT from sufficiently patient middlemen in order to exchange with them on credit,where T ≤ δEm − Ψ, and these middlemen would pay it (beside those others citedhere, see, for instance, Arnot 1889[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos794406]: 71, 80, 102,135–137, 151, 159, 204; Arnot 1893[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos794585]: 26; Harding 1905[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos817006]: 81, 95–96, 142,148, 290; Serpa Pinto 1881[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos844380], vol. 1, 67–68,90, 175, 228–229; Graca 1890[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos815672]; Johnston 1893[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos822019]: 111; Capello andIvens 1969 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos802580]: vol.1, 87, 116–117, 137–138; Livingstone 1963[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829821]: vol. 1, 9, 33,98; Cameron 1877 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos802437]:77).23 Thus “it is not surprising that tribute is paid to the [every] villageheadman where one sets up the camp” (Silva Porto 1885[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos844766]: 577).24Tribute demands acted as a risk premium that communities of vulnerable producerscharged middlemen. Those demands helped protect producers against the risk ofinteracting with traveling traders who, as a general class, were comprised ofsome patient and some impatient members. More specifically, tribute acted as atax on patient middlemen used to subsidize impatient middlemen's banditry. Bytaxing middlemen who expressed a desire to exchange, producers could extractcompensation from patient middlemen who traded with them to cover losses thatimpatient middlemen imposed on them when the latter plundered them.25 This helpsexplain Francois Coillard's (1897[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos804749]: 611) remarkabout the Luvale chief – Chief Kakenge – when he noted the “homage or rather atax he exacts from black Portuguese traders who enter his country.”Tribute frequently took two forms: goods that producers consumed immediately orshortly after receiving them, for instance, an ox that would be slaughtered andeaten right away, alcohol or tobacco, or European novelties (for example, awatch) that weren't sought by middlemen to bring to coastal European traders forexport. The reason for this is straightforward: to avoid tribute paymentscontributing to vulnerable communities’ stocks of thievable goods. If tributewas either consumed quickly or consisted of goods middlemen weren't looking for,producers didn't need to fear losing it to a violent caravan's banditry.26Key to its usefulness as a risk premium, tribute also needed to constitute a netgain to recipient producers. This ruled out the possibility of presentreciprocation, as was practiced in gift-exchange arrangements between somevillages and which, as the discussion in this book's first essay suggests, mayhave reflected social-distance-reducing signaling.27 Thus, although communitiesof producers often offered traveling traders food or temporary shelter afterreceiving tribute, these “gifts” were worth substantially less than those theydemanded, leaving a large effective premium in place (Miller 1970[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos834221]: 193). AsLivingstone (1963[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829821]: 253; see also,Harding 1905 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos817006]:192, 290) complained, for example, “the Negroes do not seem to have the smallestidea of presents being reciprocal.”Considering where we started from, producers’ use of tribute highlights asurprising result of their interaction with middlemen. That starting place,recall, was this: without government, stationary and permanently weak personsare at the violent whim of mobile and permanently strong ones. Inlate-nineteenth-century west-central Africa, however, it was stationary andpermanently weak producers who ended up with the upper hand over mobile andpermanently strong caravans. The former managed to charge the latter for theprivilege of trade rather than the latter violently overwhelming the former andstealing whatever they wanted. By altering the cost-benefit structure of tradeversus violence, weaker persons’ self-governing strategies transformed strongerpersons’ incentive from plunder to peaceful exchange. Self-governance enabledtrade with bandits.* This chapter is based on and uses material from Leeson, Peter T. 2007.“Trading with Bandits.” Journal of Law and Economics 50(2): 303–321 [© 2007 TheUniversity of Chicago]. 1 For a discussion of the emergence of property rights and their defense in theabsence of formal enforcement, see Anderson and McChesney (2002[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos793788]). 2 For a classic treatment of West African trade in the colonial period throughthe early 1950s, see Bauer (1954[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos796657]). 3 As Serpa Pinto (1881[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos844380]: 22) summarizedit, “trade in Africa was divisible into two branches, viz. the purchasing ofgoods from the whites and selling them the produce of the country, andpurchasing such produce from the blacks and selling to them the aforesaidgoods.” This trade was conducted by traveling middlemen. 4 The problem I consider here is somewhat analogous to a violent version of thetraditional hold-up problem discussed by Williamson (1975[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos855501], 1985[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos855861]), Klein,Crawford, and Alchian (1978[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos822814]), and Hart andMoore (1988 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos817338]),among others. 5 Olson (1993 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos837738])and McGuire and Olson (1996[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos832328]) consider thecase when the stronger party finds it in his interest to establish permanenthegemony over the weaker individuals. If his interest is stable andencompassing, and the stronger party is sufficiently patient, he can make morethis way than by sporadically pillaging weaker parties. This chapter considersthe use of informal mechanisms that create a cheaper means for stronger agentsto credibly commit to not plunder weaker ones than establishing government overthem. For a pioneering discussion of institutions of credible commitment in thecontext of violent conflict, see Schelling (1960[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos843382]). 6 Interaction between middlemen and producers in the interior of west-centralAfrica appears to have begun around 1790 (Botelho de Vasconcellos 1844[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos800485]). 7 Capello and Ivens (1969[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos802580]: vol. 1, 103),for example, described the middlemen of Bihe as “eminently devoted totraveling.” 8 I have found no evidence to suggest that middlemen were cartelized or in anyway coordinated their actions to prevent arms from reaching producers.Nevertheless, they appear to have infrequently supplied firearms to producers. 9 While some indigenous persons in the remote interior of west-central Africamigrated within the areas composing this region, very few migrated outside of itand these weren't producers. According to Capello and Ivens (1969[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos802580]: vol. 1, 225; seealso, Serpa Pinto 1881[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos844380]: 255; Harding1905 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos817006]: 307), “Thenatives of T’Chiboco,” for instance, “seldom travel beyond their own country,and it is a rare sight to behold a caravan of Ma-quioco journeying westward forthe purposes of trade.” 10 According to Crawford (1914[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos806121]: 28), forinstance, the Governor at Benguela allowed illicit slave trading to go on underhis watch. 11 See also Capello and Ivens (1969[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos802580]: vol. 2, 49,242). 12 Even where colonial outposts had been established, formal authority oftenwasn't effective. For instance, as Arnot (1889[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos794406]: 111; see also,Harding 1905 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos817006]:306; Johnston 1893[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos822019]: 59) commented,“Though Bailundu and Bihe are within the province of Benguella, Portugueseauthority has not very much influence there.” 13 As two travelers to the interior put it, “Commerce, by obliging them[traveling traders] to make repeated journeys, carries with it, as a necessaryconsequence, the establishment of relations and the making of contracts withdistant peoples” (Capello and Ivens 1969[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos802580]: vol. 2, 18). 14 Caravan leaders often made this bad situation worse by encouraging theirgroups to steal from the villages they traveled to. Leaders were usuallyresponsible for providing their group's provisions on the road. And provisionsbecame very costly when caravans were large (see, for instance, Serpa Pinto 1881[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos844380]: vol. 1, 165).Theft was thus sometimes promoted as a cost-cutting measure. As Cameron (1877[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos802437]: 259) observed,for example, “At Kwakasongo there is an Arab settlement of some size…they sendout their caravans.…These fellows get no pay, but are allowed to loot thecountry all round in search of subsistence and slaves.” 15 According to Crawford (1914[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos806121]: 22–23), personsin west-central Africa at this time also frequently changed their names. This,of course, would have contributed to the difficulty of tracking down violentmiddlemen. However, it remains unclear how pervasive this practice was. A thirdreason for middlemen's strength superiority could also be added. Namely, thefact that they were mobile and producers were stationary meant that middlemenhad the ability to initiate surprise attacks on communities of producers. Thismay help explain Serpa Pinto's (1881[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos844380]: vol. 1, 178)comment: “It is a noteworthy circumstance connected with wars in this part ofthe Africa, that the attacking party is ever the victor.” 16 For instance, when the traveling trader “Hassani of Dugumbe got [a] chiefinto debt” and the chief could not repay, Hassani “robbed him of ten men and tengoats to clear off the debt” (Livingstone 1874[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829396]: vol. 2, 35). 17 Translation from Oppen (1994). 18 Translation from Oppen (1994). See also, Buchner (1883[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos801399]: 82). 19 Where credit is mentioned, producers rather than middlemen were thecreditors. See, for instance, Baptista (1873[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos795656]). 20 See, for instance, Buchner (1883[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos801399]: 62), who refersto Mwant Yav's “business relations with a number of traders from the coastalareas” (translation from Oppen 1994: 360). 21 Tribute was sometimes kept and consumed by the headman or chief who receivedit. This didn't inhibit tribute's usefulness as compensation for the costimposed on them by violent middlemen, however. Occasionally, local rulers woulddeclare a monopoly right to trade with middlemen who approached them. In thisevent tribute functioned as a premium offsetting the ruler's risk of tradingwith the outsider. Additionally, tribute consumed by local leaders indirectlyreached villagers in the form of public investments undertaken by the ruler, forwhich tribute was his pay. For instance, resolving community disputes (viaarbitration) was a common duty of rulers, as was generally maintaining communityorder. Likewise, rulers could be charged with providing food in the event thecommunity encountered hard times – a form of social insurance. Tribute collectedand consumed by a chief functioned as payment for performing such publicservices, indirectly compensating community members for the risk posed byimpatient middlemen. As noted previously, some chiefs/headmen had coercivepower. When this power was greater than that of a visitor, he could use this tocoerce tribute payment. However, for reasons described already, more often thannot, it seems that this wasn't the case. Instead the power of chiefs was inpreventing access to their community. This was the case, for instance, if ariver separated his community and persons desiring to visit him and the canoewas on his side of it (see, for instance, Cameron 1877[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos802437]: 266). Chiefsalso had power in their ability to refuse to furnish guides/assistants tovisitors who didn't know the area or how to safely get to the next village, orwho required additional protection when traveling between villages. 22 Translation from Oppen (1994). See also Crawford (1914[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos806121]: 118) and Harding(1905 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos817006]: 148). 23 As the proportion of impatient caravans in the population increases, thecredibility of producers’ threat to not trade on credit with those who refuse topay tribute increases too. As ρ → 0, the gains producers forego by adhering tothis strategy fall. 24 Translation from Oppen (1994). 25 Where the total population of middlemen is θ, producers generate ρθT inrevenue from demanding tribute, which is used to help offset losses in theamount (1 − ρ)θ(－hp). To completely offset the losses imposed by impatientmiddlemen, T = −[(1 − ρ)(－hp)]/ρ. As already noted, however, the amountproducers could demand in tribute was bound at the upper limit by δEm − Ψ.Whether or not full compensation was possible therefore depended upon how muchgreater the payoff of trade was over the payoff of plunder for patient middlemen(which in turn depended on how patient patient middlemen were), the proportionof impatient middlemen in the population, and the value of the stock lost in theevent of plunder (which, of course, depended on the extent to which producerswere able to reduce their stocks). 26 The fact that thievable goods were sometimes demanded as tribute isattributable to two possible factors. On the one hand, this may reflect thatsome communities of producers assigned a relatively low probability to beingplundered by a caravan of violent middlemen. On the other hand, even though thetribute a community received – say, a slave – would ultimately be stolen by aviolent caravan, in the time between when the community received it and the timeit was stolen, the employment of the slave yielded some benefit to thecommunity. If the slave were needed enough, this benefit could outweigh thebenefit of a non-thievable tribute even though its employment wouldn't bepermanent. In this case the slave would be preferred as tribute to say, an ox,even though the former was at risk for theft while the latter wasn't. 27 For an analysis of the gift exchange system, see Landa (1994[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos824309])."},{"pageContent":"5 Efficient Plunder*No governance arrangement can preclude perfectly the prospect of strongerpersons using violence to steal from weaker ones. That, of course, includesgovernment. There always remain situations when stronger persons find itprofitable to plunder weaker ones and so do. Here I consider an extreme case ofsuch a situation under anarchy – one in which profitable opportunities forplunder are ubiquitous and, at least temporarily, there's no chance ofsignificantly reducing them: war.This case is instructive not because it characterizes the usual state of affairsunder anarchy, but because its extremity in opportunity for, and frequency of,profitable plunder provides a chance to examine the question of just how violentand destructive – how “Hobbesian” – even a Hobbesian jungle can become. In thisessay, then, the central problem that persons under anarchy confront isn't howto prevent plunder, which is already an inescapable feature of the sociallandscape, but rather how to limit plunder's social cost.Everyone knows theft is socially inefficient. From society's perspective,resources thieves use to transfer others’ property to themselves and resourcesothers use to prevent thieves from stealing their property are wasted. Thesocial costs of violent theft – of plunder – are larger still. Plunder not onlyproduces deadweight losses in the form of wasted resources. It literallydestroys resources that are obliterated in violent contests between plunderersand their victims.1What's typically overlooked is that plunderers have strong incentives to engagein activities that reduce plunder's social losses – to make plunder moreefficient. While self-interest seeking leads plunderers to embark on violenttheft in the first place, it also leads them to do so in ways that reduce theirprivate cost. This in turn reduces plunder's social cost.When contracts between plunderers and their victims are enforceable andtransaction costs are low, plunderers and their victims benefit from trade thatfacilitates the former's ability to plunder the latter. Coasean “plundercontracts” transform part of plunder's social costs – resources invested inviolent appropriation and lost in violent conflict over ownership – into privatebenefits for plunderers and their victims. A significant portion of the wealththat plunder would otherwise destroy is preserved instead. The result is lesssocially costly, and thus more efficient, plunder.To investigate this claim I consider maritime marauding in the eighteenth andnineteenth centuries. During war privately owned and operated vessels from enemynations called privateers plundered one another's merchant shipping.2Traditional plunder whereby a privateer battled a merchantman and then hauledits prize back to port for condemnation in a “prize court” was costly to theprivateer, the merchantman, and society. To reduce their costs of plunder,privateers developed a system of ransom and parole founded on Coasean plundercontracts between themselves and victim merchantmen.Under these contracts privateers agreed to give merchantmen, their cargoes, andtheir crews their freedom for a price. The Coasean bargains that underlaid theransom and parole system not only preserved merchant vessels, their cargoes, andmerchant sailors’ lives and freedom. They preserved privateering vessels,privateersmen's lives, and improved privateers’ profit while reducing the socialcost of maritime marauding. Not all privateers could capitalize on this system,but those that did facilitated more efficient plunder.My discussion highlights the Coase theorem's relevance and operation where it'sexpected least: between powerful plunderers and weak victims. Traditionally, theCoase theorem's operability is confined to situations in which property rightsare well defined and interactions are voluntary. However, this essay suggeststhat Coase's (1960[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos804088]) insight alsoapplies to situations in which property rights are poorly defined andinteractions are coercive.While exchange and coercion are usually thought of as mutually exclusive, mydiscussion illustrates the possibility and practice of exchange within coercionor, more generally, cooperation within conflict. In turn, that possibilityplaces an upper bound on how destructive, and thus “nasty, brutish, and short,”even an anarchic world populated by parties locked into violent conflict canbecome.A Theory of (More) Efficient PlunderPlunder's social cost has three sources: resources invested to steal others’property, resources used to defend against predation, and the deadweight loss ofdestruction. The first two sources are socially costly because resourcesinvested to transfer or defend property aren't used to produce wealth. The thirdis costly because resources are literally and irrevocably destroyed. The pie ofexisting wealth shrinks.Perfectly efficient plunder avoids each of these costs completely. Itconstitutes a costless transfer. If no resources were required to violentlysteal from others or defend against violent theft, and violent theft destroyednothing, its social cost would be zero. Plunder would be a costless reassignmentof property from one holder to another.3 Because, at a minimum, plunder requirestime, it always involves a positive cost and perfectly efficient plunder isimpossible.However, more efficient plunder is possible and can, under certaincircumstances, approach the perfectly efficient ideal. More efficient plundersatisfies one or more of the following conditions: (1) It economizes onre-sources plunderers use to steal from victims. (2) It economizes on resourcesvictims use to prevent being plundered. (3) It economizes on resources destroyedin violent struggles between plunderers and their victims.My theory of more efficient plunder is a special case of the theory of the gainsfrom trade. The unique aspect of this theory's operation in the case of plunderis the source of those gains: plunder's social cost. That cost is also a privatecost borne partly by plunderers. The more resources plunderers must expend toexploit their victims, the lower their return from plundering. Thus plunderershave an incentive to satisfy condition (1) for more efficient plunder – toeconomize on resources used to steal from victims.Additionally, the more resources victims must expend to prevent being plundered,the lower plunderers’ return will be from plundering. Resources victims use todeter plunder are resources plunderers can't steal. This gives plunderers anincentive to satisfy condition (2) for more efficient plunder – to economize onresources victims use to prevent being plundered.Similarly, the more resources plunderers destroy in violent fights with theirvictims over property, the less they earn from plundering. This gives plunderersan incentive to satisfy condition (3) for more efficient plunder – to economizeon resources destroyed in violent struggles with their victims.Plunderers can conserve on resources spent to produce, to prevent, and that aredestroyed during violent theft by striking bargains – forging “plundercontracts” – with their victims. In exchange for victims forgoing defensiveinvestments to prevent being plundered and surrendering their propertypeacefully, plunderers agree to give some of that property back to them. Victimsare worse off than if they weren't plundered at all. But conditional on beingplundered in the first place, they're better off than if they don't enter thisagreement. Plunderers are better off by the amount of resources they save byinducing victims to forego defensive investments and to surrender their propertypeacefully (less the amount returned to their victims for acquiescence). Thisincludes the resources they would have spent producing plunder, those thatvictims would have consumed in preventative measures and thus would have beenunavailable for the taking, and those that would have been destroyed in violentclashes with their victims. Plunder contracts transform part of plunder's socialcost into private benefits for plunderers and their victims. In doing so theymake plunder more efficient.The larger plunder's social cost when plunder doesn't economize on the resourcesused in plunderous production, the resources victims use to prevent plunder, andthe resources destroyed in the violent conflict plunder precipitates, the largerthe space for mutually beneficial exchange through plunder contracts, and thusthe more likely it is that plunder will be conducted more efficiently. Forexample, plunder is more socially costly when the means of producing it are lessspecific than when they're more specific. In the former case, resources spentplundering have a higher opportunity cost: they could be used to produce a widerange of other things. In the latter case, resources spent plundering don't havemany – or in the limiting case, any – alternative uses. It follows that thespace for mutually beneficial exchange via plunder contracts is larger when themeans of plunderous production are less specific. The plunderer's benefit ofachieving a Coasean agreement with his victim is bigger in this case, making itmore likely that he will forge such an agreement with his victim.Three conditions must be satisfied for plunderer-victim Coasean bargains to takeplace and thus for more efficient plunder to be possible. First, transactioncosts must be sufficiently low to make exchange between plunderers and victimsworthwhile. If a plunderer speaks English but his victim only speaks Swahili,striking such a bargain may be prohibitively costly. Transaction costs may alsobe prohibitively high if the bargaining process is protracted and thus theparties have difficulty reaching a mutually agreeable price because they'renegotiating strategically to increase their share of the gains from trade.Similarly, if many parties must be brought into the negotiation to make Coaseanplunder agreements possible, bargaining costs may exceed the gains availablefrom forging such agreements, preventing them from coming into existence.Second, information about the plunderer's and victim's strength must besymmetric. The plunderer and victim must agree that the plunderer is stronger.If the victim is delusional about his relative strength, he may believe he canobtain better terms than what the plunderer offers through exchange by battlinghim. This prevents the parties from negotiating a Coasean bargain required formore efficient plunder.Finally, plunder contracts must be enforceable. If either party to the plundercontract expects the other to renege, Coasean agreement is impossible. There areseveral ways that plunderers and their victims can make their contractsself-enforcing. A Williamsonian (Williamson 1983[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos855673]) hostage exchangeis one example. A plunderer and/or his victim may give his counterparty ahostage that's valuable to him but not to his counterparty to ensure contractualcompliance. Or he may give such a hostage to a third party who destroys orreleases it to his counterparty if he reneges. Further, while the discipline ofcontinuous dealings is typically unable to prevent plunder, it may neverthelessbe able in some cases to support Coasean plunder agreements. A plunderer whoviolates his agreement with a victim may find future victims unwilling tocontract with him. If the plunderer is sufficiently patient, the shadow of thefuture can enforce his plunder contracts today. The specific ways in whichplunderers and their victims make their contracts self-enforcing depend on theparticular situations in which they find themselves. In some cases hostageswapping without resorting to a third party may be effective. In other cases athird party may be needed. In still others reputation may be most effective, andso on.Privateering and Maritime PlunderPrivateering in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries provides a useful casefor exploring this theory of more efficient plunder. Privateering began in thetwelfth century as a form of self-help against maritime muggers. Severalcenturies later privateering's self-help role had given way to one as the meansfor cash-strapped nations to prosecute war against enemies at sea. Even into theeighteenth century, by which time European governments had grown their publicnavies considerably, their navies remained too small and weak to conduct warfareeffectively on the water alone.4Privateering remedied this situation by calling private initiative to the wareffort. Although, as I discuss later, privateers were commissioned by theirrespective governments and operated within the constraints of rules thesegovernments created, interactions between privateers of one nation and thevessels of another were formally ungoverned and thus anarchic. There wasn't inthe eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as there isn't today, a formalsupranational agency with the authority to oversee and control interactionsbetween foreign countries, let alone belligerents. Foreign sovereigns and theircitizens dealt with one another in an anarchic international arena.Privateering was a form of maritime plunder. I focus on British and NorthAmerican privateering, but the system worked similarly elsewhere. The way it didso is straightforward.5 A group of investors sought a “letter of marque” fromtheir government. This licensed them to send a private warship to sea over astipulated time to plunder the merchant ships of an enemy nation (see, forinstance, Admiralty Court Prize Papers 39, 1691; Admiralty Court Prize Papers90, 1693; Admiralty Court Miscellanea 862, 1694; Admiralty Court Prize Papers118, 1742; Admiralty Court Prize Papers 115, 1746; Admiralty Court Letter ofMarque Declarations 12, f. 1, 1760).6 Investors earned a pre-negotiated share ofany “prizes” their crew captured. Until the first decade of the eighteenthcentury, in return for commissioning the privateer, the British governmententitled itself to a share of prizes as well. To encourage privateering, itgenerously left off this practice in 1708.There were two sorts of privateers: letters of marque and private men-of-war.The former was a merchant ship engaged in trade but also licensed “to annoy theenemy and take their ships, as occasion shall offer” (P.C. Register 76, f. 142,1695). Letters of marque were primarily traders. Their crewmen earned fixedwages like typical merchant sailors. But they also earned shares of any prizestheir vessels might plunder while engaged in commercial activity.Private men-of-war were private warships fitted specifically for the purpose ofplundering enemy merchant shipping.7 Private men-of-war didn't engage incommercial activity. Their crewmen were paid exclusively in shares and only ifthey plundered successfully. Because private men-of-war engaged only in plunder,they were typically smaller and without the large cargo-carrying capacity ofmerchant ships. This made them faster and more agile than merchantmen, eventhough they carried more crewmembers and guns per ship tonnage.Upon application to the Admiralty for a privateering commission, a privateer'sowners signed a performance bond to secure its good conduct. The bond's valuedepended on the proposed vessel's or crew's size (see, for instance, AdmiraltySecretary In Letters 3878, April 12, 1744; Admiralty Secretary In Letters 3878,June 30, 1744; Admiralty Court Letter of Marque Declarations 12, f. 1, 1760).8As the instructions for a privateer that James II commissioned after hisabdication read, “Before the ship put to sea, security is to be given toour…agent or his deputy for the due performance of the above articles” (Hist.MSS Commission, Stuart Papers, i, 92, 1694). If the privateer went about seizingneutral vessels or other ships not permitted under the terms of its commission,or operated outside the area or time frame specified in this commission, itcould forfeit its bond.A privateer could also forfeit its bond if it was later discovered that its crewhad misused enemy prisoners. The “law of nations” – the international law of warthat European and North American governments respected and enforced on theircitizens – protected prisoners.9 As American privateer owner George Stiles'sbond read for the Nonsuch, a ship he fitted out during the War of 1812, the bondwas to ensure that the “said armed vessel shall observe the treaties and laws ofthe United States, and the instructions which shall be given to them accordingto law for the regulation of their conduct.”The instructions referred to here, issued to every privateer when it receivedits commission, instructed the privateer “to pay the strictest regard to therights of neutral powers, and the usages of civilized nations.…Towards enemyvessels and their crews, you are to proceed, in exercising the rights of warwith all the justice and humanity which characterizes the nation of which youare members” (Garitee 1977[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813837]: 94, 97–98). Asthe instructions George II issued to British privateers in 1739 read, “no Personor Persons, taken or Surprized in any Ship or Vessell as aforesaid, tho’ knownto be of the Enemy's Party, shall be in Cold Blood killed, maimed, or by Tortureand Cruelty Inhumanely Treated, contrary to the Common Usage and just Permissionof War,” under the threat of severe punishment for violating these instructions(Jameson 1923 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821178]:349).When a privateer overtook an enemy merchant ship, it was entitled to take itsprize back to port in the commission-issuing country or, in some cases, a portin a friendly foreign nation (see, for instance, Admiralty Court Libels 117, No.82, 1676; Letter of Marque Declarations I, f. 23, 1689; Hist. MSS. Commission,Stuart Papers, i, 92, 1694; Admiralty Court Prize Papers 118, 1742). In theseports were “prize courts” that determined the seized merchant vessel's status.If the court adjudged the prize legitimate – that is, an enemy-owned vessel –the ship and its cargo were condemned and auctioned, and the proceeds weredivided according to the terms established in the privateer's contract betweenits owners and crew. The prize court received an administrative fee. Thegovernment received its share (if any), and import duties on the receipts of thevessel's and cargo's sale were appropriated by the commissioning government, theprivateer “duely and truly pay[ing] or caus[ing] to be paid…the usual customesdue His Majestie for all ships and goods so as aforesaid taken and adjudged forprize” (Admiralty Court Prize Papers 63, 1719).10The most common reason a prize court adjudged a prize illegitimate was that theprize wasn't in fact an enemy-owned merchantman. Rather, it was owned bycitizens of a neutral power whose ire the commissioning government was eager notto raise, “it being our royal intention,” a letter to the Lords of the Admiraltyexplained, “that…all engagements which subsist between us and our said goodfriends and allies should be most carefully and religiously observed” (S.P. Dom.Naval 60, April 30, 1744; see also, S.P. Foreign, Foreign Ministers, &c, 22,April 7, 1705; S.P. Dom. Naval 34, f. 265, 1744).11 Like privateers, commercialvessels in the Age of Sail carried a variety of false flags and papers toprevent enemy privateers or navy warships from seizing them. Thus it wasn'talways easy for privateers to discern whether a prospective prize was legitimateor not. If a mistake arising from such difficulty appeared honest to theadjudicating prize court, the vessel and its crew were released and theprivateer received nothing. If the mistake was the result of negligence, theprivateer's owners could be ordered to pay damages to the offended neutralvessel's owners. In cases of willful illegitimate seizure, or if mistakes becamecommon, the offending privateer could forfeit its bond and lose its commission.In addition to prohibiting privateers from mistreating merchant sailors theyoverwhelmed or killing such sailors in cold blood, the law of nations imposedsome positive obligations on privateers. Privateers couldn't seize a merchantship and dump its crewmembers in the water to fend for themselves. To condemn acaptured vessel, prize courts required testimony from two or three merchantsailors from the vessels a privateer seized – typically the captain and a fewofficers.Privateers had two choices for other members of a quarry's crew: they couldrelease the sailors if a vessel was available to send them home in, or theycould take the sailors with them, requiring the privateers to provide for thesailors until they could be sent home via a prisoner cartel arranged in port orat sea. Under the rights the law of nations afforded prisoners, privateers were“bound for fair and safe custody [of captives], and…liable for any lossoccasioned by their neglect or want of proper care.…In cases of gross misconducton the part of private captors, the [captors’ government's] court will decree arevocation of their commission” (Upton 1863[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos853445]: 393).Prisoner cartels were belligerent nations’ means of exchanging prisoners inwartime. To ease the burden of providing for captured enemies and to get one'sown prisoners back, warring nations traded prisoners – man for man of equal rank– throughout (and sometimes following) conflict. Thus if Britain sent fifteenFrench merchant sailors who British privateers had recently captured andreturned to port with for adjudication to France, France would send fifteenBritish merchant sailors of the same status to England.12The law of nations, which governed such arrangements, amounted to promisesbetween sovereigns about prisoner treatment and related matters describedearlier. But European governments enforced this law on their own citizens,threatened by the discipline of continuous dealings. So it was generally upheld.A privateer that misused prisoners taken into custody by starving them, ordispatching them outside one of the accepted methods described previously,jeopardized its prize, which the prize courts might release, as well as itsbond, which the courts might seize.13Indeed prize courts sometimes ruled against privateers in the case at hand basedon their past mistreatment of prisoners when this was discovered. The Britishprivateer Minerva captured the Anna at the mouth of the Mississippi River in1805. The justice presiding in this prize case, Sir W. Scott, discovered thatbefore capturing the Anna, the Minerva captured a Spanish vessel named theBilbao. The privateersmen of Minerva set the Bilbao's prisoners ashore on anuninhabited island near the mouth of the Mississippi. Justice Scott consideredthis “an act highly unjustifiable in its own nature.” Because of it, he refusedto condemn the Anna (Roscoe 1905[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos842253]: 399).Privateer-Merchantman Coasean BargainingRansom and ParoleThe potential social losses of privateer-committed maritime plunder arefamiliar: resources privateers devoted to transferring foreign merchant shipowners’ wealth to themselves, resources merchantmen devoted to attempting toprevent privateer capture, and resources destroyed in violent conflict withmerchantmen in privateers’ efforts to appropriate their vessels and cargo.However, provided their interactions satisfied the conditions discussed earlierin this essay, my theory predicts that privateers and merch-antmen would enterCoasean contracts, facilitating more efficient plunder.As that theory suggests, central to this possibility was the costliness ofproducing plunder for privateers. Privateers’ cost of producing plunder hadseveral sources. The first was violent conflict with a merchantman. This cost ofproducing plunder resulted from privateers’ failure to use Coasean bargains toinduce potential victims to forego making defensive investments – a failure thatin turn resulted from a failure to satisfy one of the three conditions requiredfor such bargains to come into existence, identified earlier: sufficiently lowtransaction costs.In principle privateers could have struck agreements with merchantmen not to armor undertake other defensive measures in consideration for receiving a largerfraction of the goods privateers would otherwise seize from them if theyoverwhelmed them. Both parties had an incentive to create such an agreement. If,say, a merchantman could save $150 worth of goods from being plundered by makinga defensive investment that cost it $100, both parties could benefit by forgingan agreement in which the merchantman agreed to not spend anything on defensiveinvestments in exchange for the privateer agreeing to seize $60 worth of goodsless when it plundered the merchantman.Such bargains proved impossible in practice, however, because privateers’strengths varied. The price a privateer would be willing to pay to a merchantmanin the form of more returned goods following plunder depended on its strength.Stronger privateers would have a lower maximum willingness to pay to inducevictims to forgo defensive investments. Weaker privateers would have higherones.Because a Coasean bargain inducing victims to forgo such investments would havebe to forged ex ante – that is, before merchantmen took to the water – thiswould have required each merchantman to strike a separate agreement with eachprivateer. Given the many privateers that might attack them, such agreementswere prohibitively costly. Alternatively, if every privateer could agree withevery other privateer to take to the water with the same vessel, number of guns,men, and so on, such that all would have the same strength, merchantmen wouldonly have to conclude one contract with all privateers. But in this caseprohibitive transaction costs would have entered through another door: that ofeach individual privateer contracting with all others.Because of the prohibitive transaction costs of doing so, privateers andmerchantmen were unable to create Coasean bargains that could preclude thelatter's defensive investments, leaving this source of plunder's social costunmitigated. Merchantmen invested in defensive measures capable of preventingsome privateer plunder.Those measures took several forms. First, merchantmen invested in guns for theirships. As I discuss later, the average merchantman in the mid-eighteenth centuryof some 240 tons carried 28 guns (Swanson 1991[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos848614]: 61, 71).Similarly, they could employ vessel shapes/sizes that made them faster forbattle maneuvering. Second, merchantmen sometimes sailed along outlying or lessdesirable routes where privateers were less prevalent or didn't sail.14 Third,merchantmen sailed together in convoys instead of individually, which made themharder for privateers to attack (see, for instance, Martens and Horne 1801[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos831024]). Closelyrelated, to reduce the threat privateers posed, merchantmen resorted to “directvoyages,” which ran to a single port and back, instead of engaging in morelucrative “multilateral voyages,” which involved visits to several ports beforereturning home (see, for instance, Morgan 1989[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos835134]).These defensive investments were costly to merchantmen and society. Theyhindered merchantmen's capacity to serve as merchant ships, reducing theirprofits, and in doing so retarded merchant shipping's ability to produce wealth.Canon took up room that cargo would otherwise occupy. Their added weight slowedthe carrying vessel down. A sharper-built vessel could reduce the merchantman'scargo capacity and undermine its stability for long cargo-carrying expeditions.Similarly, an outlying route was a longer one or undesirable for other reasons,such as being harder to sail. Using it cost a merchantman precious time andcould increase the odds of a wreck, delay, or damage resulting from lessfavorable waters and weather. Convoys were also costly. They required multiplemerchantmen to coordinate their sailing dates, routes, and stops, creating a“package” whose elements differed from those that convoy members would chooseindividually if they were unconstrained by the need to sail in consort withothers. These defensive investments not only reduced wealth by divertingresources that could otherwise be used for productive purposes to the preventionof plunder. They reduced wealth by raising the cost of merchant shipping, whichreduced the number of merchant ships engaged in trade.A fourth “defensive investment” of sorts to which merchantmen resorted mightalso be added to those just mentioned: insurance. Insurance didn't prevent ordeter privateer attacks, but it partly reflected merchantmen's attempts tomitigate the losses of privateer plunder.15 And higher insurance premiumsbecause of privateer threats contributed to merchant shipping's cost and thusthe associated reduction in wealth-creating merchant shipping activity thathigher shipping costs engendered.Because transaction costs prevented Coasean bargains that would have ensuredmerchantmen disarmament, most merchantmen were armed. If a merchantman resisteda privateer's advances, running or engaging its attacker, a bloody melee waslikely to ensue. This contributed to plunder's cost for privateers. Althoughprivateers were typically much stronger than the merchant vessels they attacked,even a significantly weaker merchantman was capable of putting up a fight. Amerchantman couldn't only damage the privateering vessel. It could injure orkill its crewmembers. Captain Harriot's St. Kitts-based privateer discoveredthis when it engaged a French merchantman near the Calicos Islands in 1744. Themerchantman fought back, killing eighteen of Harriot's privateer crew andinjuring many more (Swanson 1991[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos848614]: 198). Even if amerchantman wasn't strong enough to significantly damage its attacker, if thetwo came to blows, damage to the merchantman and its cargo hindered theprivateer's ability to bring its prize safely to port and reduced what the prizecould fetch at auction. In extreme cases the entire prize might be lost, leavingthe privateer with nothing to show for its efforts.Privateers confronted two other costs of producing plunder: the cost of bringingthe victim to a prize court to adjudge its legitimacy and the cost of carryingand providing for captured merchant sailors. Privateers could and did seizeprizes considerable distances from the nearest prize court. Even when theydidn't, the nearest prize court located at the port where their plundered goodshad the greatest market could be far. A privateer that had to return to shoreafter taking each prize lost considerable time in transit that could be spentplundering instead. More important, traveling any distance back to port was arisky endeavor. At some point every privateer needed to return home. But themore trips a privateer made between port and its cruising ground, the greaterwere the risks it would never make it back.The high risk of additional back-and-forth trips had several sources. One wasthe unavoidable chance of seaborne travel, such as the prospect of shipwreck ora related nature-driven tragedy. But the most significant risk of such trips wasmanmade: the possibility of destruction or capture by the enemy. This danger wasespecially high when to return with a merchantman to the nearest prize court aprivateer had to break through an enemy blockade (see, for instance, Crowhurst1989 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos806445]: 36). If itnegotiated the blockade unsuccessfully, the privateer stood to lose not only itsprize to the enemy but its freedom as well.If a privateer had enough crewmembers, it could place some of its men on theprize to create a “prize crew” to return to port for consideration by a prizecourt, allowing the privateer to remain at sea. However, some privateers weretoo small to do this. “Many of the [French] corsairs…in the eastern half of theEnglish Channel” in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, forexample, “carried a handful of men which was barely adequate to sail the shipand provide prize crews” (Crowhurst 1989[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos806445]: 53).Even for larger privateers that had enough men to form prize crews, deliveringvictims to prize courts remained costly. Putting enough men on a captured quarryto create a prize crew weakened the privateer, reducing its ability to takefuture prizes and defend itself against attack. The British privateer Sheernesshad to let five potential French prizes escape because its crew remained toosmall for the task, most of its members having departed previously on prizecrews (Swanson 1991[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos848614]: 63). Further,prize crews, like the privateers that created them, faced the threat of captureen route to port. In the War of 1812 less than one-third of American prize crewsmade it to port (Garitee 1977[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813837]: 170). Many ofthese lost their freedom to British privateers and navy ships on their way toprize courts.The third important cost of producing plunder for privateers was carrying andproviding for the merchant crews they overtook. The law of nations requiredprivateers to care for their captives until they were brought to port or couldbe exchanged via a prisoner cartel. Provisions used to support prisoners reducedthose available to privateer crewmembers, shortening the duration of plunderingcruises because reprovisioning became necessary more often.16Taking on prisoners posed another problem: the prisoners might revolt. Thisprospect was most significant on a prize crew. During the American RevolutionaryWar, the American privateer Yankee captured two British merchantmen and putprize crews aboard both. The Yankee's crew must have been severely disappointedwhen British prisoners overwhelmed both prize crews and managed to seize controlof the Yankee, making the American privateersmen the captives (Coggins 2002[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos804412]: 68).To avoid these costs of plunder, which not only constituted social costs butalso private costs for privateers, many privateers resorted to plunder contractswith merchantmen they overwhelmed. As I describe later, unlike Coasean contractsthat could have induced victims to forego defensive investments to preventplunder, Coasean contracts that could induce victims to surrender their goodspeacefully once attacked, which permitted privateers to avoid the costs ofplundering described earlier, could in some cases satisfy the conditionsrequired for such bargains to come into existence, and thus were possible. Inthese cases privateers and merchantmen forged them. The resulting contractsformed the basis for the system of “ransom and parole.”After overwhelming a merchantman, such a privateer offered its victims thefollowing bargain: for a price it would allow the merchant vessel, its cargo,and its crewmembers their freedom. If the price was right, this arrangement wasmutually beneficial. Provided the price agreed on in the plunder contract washigher than what the privateer expected to earn if it plundered its victimtraditionally and thus had to incur the costs discussed earlier, it was happy toenter such a contract.Consider French privateer captain Nathaniel Fanning's reasoning, whose crewaboard the Comte de Guichen “ransomed…two [British merchant] ships…for threethousand two hundred guineas; and the brig and cargo for five hundred.” Although“these two sums were not more than half the value of these vessels,” Fanningnoted, “we thought it more prudent to ransom them for this sum than to run therisque of sending them to France” (Fanning 1912[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos811237]: 139). Orconsider the reasoning of privateer captain William Ashion who sought to avoidthe cost of creating a prize crew when he entered a plunder contract with theWife of Sable d’Ollone: “the Master thereof proposing to Ransom…considering thenumber of men they had on board, and that he could not send her for this Island,without coming allong with her, which should have been a great hindrance tohim,” Ashion was pleased to negotiate a plunder agreement with his victiminstead (Bromley 1987[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos800870]: 344).Provided the price agreed on in the plunder contract was lower than what themerchantman expected to lose if the privateer plundered it traditionally – lowerthan the value of the ship, its cargo, and the value the merchantman'screwmembers attached to their freedom – it was also happy to enter such acontract. As Fanning describes in his case, the merchantmen got an excellentdeal, paying only half the value they would have lost without the plunderagreement. Such an arrangement benefited both parties by preventing thedestruction of valuable vessels, cargo, and men. The possibility of such anoffer lowered merchantmen's cost of being plundered, encouraging them to submitto stronger privateer attackers. This permitted the plunder process to proceedpeaceably rather than through violence, avoiding the deadweight losses ofviolent conflict.If a mutually agreeable ransom price could be arrived at, the merchantman andprivateer drew up a written contract in duplicate called a “ransom bill,”stating the agreement's terms. Under these terms the merchant ship captainobligated his ship's owner – and failing that, himself – to pay the privateerupon presentation of the bill. In return the agreement entitled the merchantmanto safe passageway, or “parole,” without plunder by other privateers from theransoming privateer's nation or allies, to a specified port within a proscribedperiod of time and in some cases via a proscribed route. If the merchantman wereapproached by another privateer from that nation or one of its allies en route,it needed only to produce the ransom bill and the privateer would customarilyallow the ship to continue on its way.Consider the ransom bill contracted between a British privateer, the Ambuscade,and its French merchant ship victim, Le Saint Nicolas, circa 1711 (AdmiraltyCourt Prize Papers 91, 1711):> Whereas on the seventh day of October, old style, 1711, the ship called St> Nichola of Sable d’Olone, near Rochelle, whereof Jacque Ayreau is commander,> together with her cargo as follows, viz. nine thousand Bank fish, and forty> hogsheads of salt, and four hogsheads of oyl, or thereabouts, was taken prize> by the Ambuscade of Bristol, a private man of war, Robert Summers commander,> by virtue of a commission bearing date in London the twenty ninth day of March> 1711.

Privateering was close tothe ideal in this respect because privateers’ plunderous capital was highlynonspecific. Most privateers were simply modified merchant vessels. As Rajan andZingales (1998 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos839611])point out, asset owners have incentives to develop their assets in ways thatretain their value in alternative uses – to avoid making specific investments.This is as true for plunderers, such as privateer owners, as it is for anyoneelse. Privateer owners benefited by investing in vessels that were useful innon-plunder-related production, such as commercial voyages, in addition to beinguseful for producing plunder. Privateer owners accomplished this by modifyingexisting merchantmen to build their ships or, when seeking purpose-constructedprivate men-of-war, by building privateers generically enough to be useable inmerchant shipping when not plundering.Recall the two types of privateers: merchantmen with a commission to plunder(letters of marque), which differed from ordinary merchantmen only by virtue oftheir raiding license and the fact that they might carry a few extra guns; andprivate men-of-war, which were often smaller and had less cargo-carryingcapacity than typical merchantmen. Nearly all other basic elements of privatemen-of-war were the same as typical merchantmen. Thus they could be easilyconverted to regular merchantmen when not employed for plunderous purposes.Indeed, “the majority” of private men-of-war were merely “merchantmen convertedfor the task” (Starkey 2001[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos848171]: 72; see also,Swanson 1991 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos848614]: 57,120).Converting private men-of-war back to merchantmen when war ended was equallystraightforward. More than 90 percent of the privateers that went to sea fromAmerica's chief privateering port in Baltimore in the War of 1812 were schooners– vessels identical to the brigs preferred in merchant shipping save theirrigging.17 Similarly, 50 percent of Massachusetts’ early-nineteenth-centuryprivateering fleet consisted of schooners. Sixty-six percent of New York'sprivateering fleet did as well (Garitee 1977[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813837]: 166, 114). Ifthey weren't already fit for a particular merchant shipping need, by simplymodifying their sail setups, many “sharp-built” schooners could easily be madeso. And, when war ended, this is precisely what many privateer owners, orindividuals who purchased ex-privateers, did (Garitee 1977[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813837]: 220).18The switch was still cheaper for privateers that were letters of marque. Thesecould be “converted” to regular merchantmen simply by taking one or two guns offthem.19 Indeed, even this “conversion” wasn't required: letters of marque weremerchant ships. For them, costs saved through plunder contracts over producingplunder traditionally, such as the travel time involved in going back and forthto prize courts with prizes, translated directly into socially productiveactivity – more time spent commercial shipping – even before war ended.Letters of marque were numerous – more numerous in many cases than privatemen-of-war. For instance, 7,100 of the 9,151 British vessels that soughtprivateer commissions between 1739 and 1815, or nearly 78 percent, were lettersof marque (Starkey 1997[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos847783]: 130). Similarly,in the War of 1812, 114 of Baltimore's 175 privateers, or more than 65 percent,were letters of marque (Garitee 1977[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813837]: 166). Thesevessels’ capital was equally well suited for productive (commerce) andnonproductive (plundering) purposes, permitting them to quickly andinexpensively “transform” their capital's application to commerce and plunder asthey found convenient.20Conditions for Privateer-Merchantman Plunder Contracts and Their BreakdownEarlier I highlighted several conditions that must be satisfied to make Coaseanplunder contracts possible. Transaction costs must be sufficiently low,information about the plunderer's and victim's strength must be symmetric, andplunderer-victim bargains must be enforceable. Many – but, as I discuss later,not all – privateer-merchantman relations satisfied these conditions forbargains that reduced the cost of producing plunder and reduced the deadweightloss of destruction in connection with privateer-merchantman conflicts. Thispermitted some privateers and merchantmen to forge Coasean agreements like theone recounted in the previous section, facilitating more efficient plunder.Two types of potential transaction costs threatened to render suchprivateer-merchantman contracts unprofitable by overshadowing the gains of theseagreements. Both had their source in potential bargaining difficulties. Thefirst was the simple fact that because privateers and their victims werenecessarily from different countries, they spoke different languages. This meantthey didn't always know the language of the other, or didn't know it well enoughto negotiate contracts. If privateers and merchantmen couldn't communicatebecause of language barriers, they couldn't forge Coasean plunder contracts.Privateers developed a simple solution to this problem: they created templateplunder contracts in multiple languages. During the War of the SpanishSuccession (1701–1714), when France was at war with Britain, Portugal, Holland,and several other countries, French privateers carried multiple, generic plunderagreements – one in French and the others translations of the French templateinto the their enemies’ languages so their foreign victims could read them(Senior 1918 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos844253]:52).The second type of transaction cost that threatened to overwhelm the prospectivegains from privateer-merchantman plunder contracts was the time required tonegotiate such agreements. A privateer and its victim merchantman confronted aclassic bilateral monopoly problem in which, because of the unusual monopolisticand monopsonistic nature of the market, the process of converging on a mutuallyagreeable price can be long and tedious. Fortunately, although the “plundermarket” in which a privateer and its victim merchantman operated consisted ofonly a one seller and one buyer, the vessel and cargo the merchantman had thatthe privateer sought were bought and sold in competitive markets with manysellers and many buyers.Because the privateer and merchantman both had an idea about the prevailingmarket prices for these goods, the maximum price the privateer could reasonablyexpect the merchantman to pay in lieu of these goods and the minimum price themerchantman could reasonably expect the privateer to accept in lieu of thesegoods were brought close together. Remaining haggling to influence thedistribution of the surplus the agreement created was thus delimited andreflected unknowns, such as the value the different parties attached to themerchant crewmen's freedom, the odds the privateer or its prize crew would beseized en route back to the nearest prize court, and so on. Thus privateers’ andmerchantmen's bargaining ranges were narrowed significantly, lowering thetransaction cost of negotiating Coasean plunder agreements.The second condition privateers and merchantmen had to satisfy to enable Coaseanagreements between them was symmetric information about their strengths. Themost important difference between merchantmen and privateers was the largernumber of crewmembers and guns (per ton) the latter carried. Between 1739 and1748 the average privateer that plied the sea was 166 tons, carried 35 guns, andhad 100 crewmembers. The average privateer victim in this same period was 45percent bigger (241 tons), but carried 7 fewer guns and had only 11 morecrewmembers (Swanson 1991[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos848614]: 61, 71). Thus aprivateer that attacked a merchantman of equivalent size boasted significantlygreater firepower and manpower. This gave privateers the upper hand in bothship-to-ship and hand-to-hand combat.Besides knowing that the average privateer of equal size was stronger,merchantmen knew that privateers aimed to attack significantly weaker shipsbecause doing so made their job easier. Conditional on being assaulted by aprivateer, then, a merchantman also knew it was probably the weaker party andlikely to lose a fight if it resisted. As privateer historian Jerome Garitee(1977 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813837]: 148) putit, “The captain of a [privateer-attacked] merchant vessel [typically] knew hewas confronting a heavily manned, better-armed, and swifter opponent.” Thus manymerchantmen found it in their interest to submit peacefully to their plunderers,particularly when they expected Coasean bargaining opportunities that couldimprove their post-plunder positions. Because “[m]ost merchant ships wereoutsailed, outmanned and outgunned by almost any privateer…the crew meeklysurrendered when escape was impossible” (Crowhurst 1977[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos806304]: 36; see also,Crowhurst 1997 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos806603]:156–157). Consequently, “[t]he great majority of captures were made withoutresistance” (Bromley 1987[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos800870]: 356).Finally, recall that for Coasean plunder contracts to be possible, bothprivateers and merchantmen required reason to believe the other party wouldfulfill their end of the agreement. Privateers and merchantmen achieved thisthrough several means. From merchantmen's perspective the central problem wasensuring that other privateers from their captor's nation wouldn't plunder thema second time while en route to their specified destination as the terms oftheir contract promised to protect them from. Reciprocity between privateersfrom the same or allied nations – a successful application of the discipline ofcontinuous dealings – was one means of ensuring this.Equally important was privateers’ governments’ unwillingness to adjudge a“doubly seized” merchantman a good prize. For much of the eighteenth century,European governments recognized privateer-merchantman plunder contracts aslegally binding on the privateer that issued them and protected the privateer'sright as first captor to sell parole, prohibiting subsequent captors from hisnation or his nation's allies from seizing the merchantman again. The U.S.government continued to recognize such contracts’ legitimacy into the nineteenthcentury. Governments’ refusal to award doubly seized merchantmen as prizes totheir captors dramatically reduced privateers’ incentive to violate the terms ofplunder contracts their compatriots negotiated with enemy merchantmen with whomthey subsequently caught up. Because of this, merchantmen were confident theterms of their Coasean bargains with privateers would be respected.The more significant potential enforcement difficulty was from privateers’perspective. After granting a merchantman its freedom, how could a privateerensure it would be paid? Three mechanisms were critical to ensuring contractualcompliance. First, privateers often required a hostage from their victim –typically the captain of the ship or one of his officers – who they would takewith them and release only after being paid. Privateers and merchantmennegotiated the terms of such hostages, and even how they would be cared for, intheir plunder contracts. Consider the hostage terms of the ransom bill enteredinto between the French merchantman and British privateer recounted earlier(Admiralty Court Prize Papers 91, 1711; see also, Fanning 1912[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos811237]: 126, 139):> And it is agreed by and between the said Roberts Summers and the said Jacque> Ayreau that he the said Jacque Ayreau shall leave some Hostages or Ransomers> in the possession of the said Robert Summers…for and till the true payment of> the abovesaid sum so agreed upon for the Ransom of the said ship and cargo,> and shall also bind himself, his heirs, executors, administrators, and> assigns, for the true payment thereof, and the Redemption of the Hostages,> with the allowance of three shillings and four pence per day for the> victualling of the said Hostages from the date hereof until the time of their> arrival in England and being released &c, to be likewise well and truly> paid…with all other charges that may occur until the time of the Hostages> being released. Now these Presents witness that we Jonachim Bruneteau and> Andre Caillaud, at the instance and request of the said Jacque Ayreau are> willing and voluntarily oblige ourselves to become Hostages and Ransomers for> the said ship and cargo, and to remain so until the abovesaid sum…agreed upon,> with the allowance aforesaid, by fully paid and satisfyd.The second means privateers used to enforce the terms of their plunder contractswith victim merchantmen was state courts. For much of the eighteenth andnineteenth centuries, governments recognized plunder contracts as legallybinding. Britain forbade alien enemies, such as foreign privateer owners, fromdirectly initiating legal action against their citizens in their courts. Aprivateer owner couldn't sue a British merchantman that violated its plundercontract with the aid of Britain's courts.21 However, British law recognized amerchant captain's right to enter a plunder contract that obligated his ship'sowners to a privateer: “He is the agent of these owners, lawfully authorized toenter into such contracts.…His signature therefore binds them as debtors of theransom” (Wheaton 1815[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos855130]: 236).When a merchant ship captain signed a ransom bill, he also obligated himself topay his captor the agreed-on sum if his ship's owners failed to. Crucially, thelaw granted him a right of action in rem against the owners’ vessel in this caseto recover the ransom sum he paid the privateer to gain his freedom in lieu ofthe owners or, more likely, given that most hostages didn't have the fundsrequired to pay this sum, to recover his freedom by compelling the owners to paythe privateer. Because of this, privateers were able to initiate action againstnonpaying merchantmen indirectly through their hostages whose incentive wasaligned with privateers’.For example, in 1696 British merchant ship captain John Munden of the Reynerentered a plunder contract with French privateer captain Louis Daincon of thePhillipicene. According to their contract, Munden promised to “pay, or cause tobe paid, to Daincon the sum of £170 sterling, and give himself up as a prisonerfor the payment of that sum.” However, the Reyner's owners “never paid thebill.” Munden sued the Reyner from his St. Malo prison, as the law entitled himto, and succeeded. The Reyner's owners were compelled to uphold their end of theplunder contract. The Phillipicene received the payment it was due, and Mundenrecovered his freedom (Admiralty Court Libels 126, No. 107, 1698; see also,Admiralty Court Libels 130, No. 237, 1713).22 In this way a privateer could relyon its hostage's incentive to use the law to compel nonpaying merchant shipowners to comply with the terms of their plunder contracts, ensuring contractualenforcement.The third method privateers used to enforce plunder contracts with victimmerchantmen was repossession. Privateers chiefly resorted to repossession afterBritain and France banned their citizens from partaking in plunder contracts,which I discuss later. The way repossession worked was simple. If a known,nonpaying merchantman was spotted in a foreign port, its privateering creditors,or someone on their behalf, would seize it (Petrie 1999[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos838048]: 23). Althoughafter 1782 Britain and France no longer viewed plunder contracts entered into bytheir merchantmen as legally binding, the rest of Europe's governments and thoseof North America did. These governments permitted repossession enforcement intheir ports. As an early-nineteenth-century legal digest describing the law ofmaritime capture and prizes stated, although “no [plunder] contract can beenforced against a British subject in the courts of his own country[,]…There isno such prohibition by the municipal laws of other states, and the contract maytherefore be enforced in them” (Wheaton 1815[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos855130]: 232).Repossession was the chief means of doing so.Many privateer-merchantman interactions satisfied the conditions re-quired forCoasean plunder agreements that reduced the cost of producing plunder and thedeadweight loss of destruction, thus enabling more efficient plunder. Accordingto historian of privateering Carl Swanson (1991[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos848614]: 204), while“[i]t is difficult to determine how often prizes were ransomed,” before Britainand France outlawed plunder contracts they were common. Indeed, this is why theBritish and French governments had to resort to legislation to curb the practicein the first place.Eager to realize the benefits of entering plunder contracts, some merchant shipowners encouraged their captains to seek ransom if privateers seized them.Before merchantman owner John Reynell sent his ship the Bolton to Antigua, heinstructed its captain that, “In case of being taken,” the captain should“Endeavour to ransom if thou cans't for Twelve Hundred Pounds Sterling (if SugarLoaden, may'st advance as much more as thou thinks Reasonable) and draw for thesame on Birkett and Booth of Antigua, on Elias Bland of London, or on us hereand the Bills shall be honourably paid and the Hostage fully Satisfied for histime, Expences, etc.” Similarly, Gerard Beekman, owner of the Dolphin, advisedhis ship's captain: “As you[r] Vessell is Loaded only with Lumber and is veryold Can be of Lettle worth to an Enimy. in Case you Should be taken Which Godforbid you may Give them fifty Pounds Sterling as a ransom for her again for Shewill not be worth that to them” (Swanson 1991[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos848614]: 204).Although little systematic data exist to measure precisely the popularity ofCoasean plunder contracts in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century privateering,what data are available suggest that while such contracts weren't the rule,neither were they exceptional. Between 1776 and 1783, when the AmericanRevolutionary War was waged, foreign privateers captured 3,386 Britishmerchantmen. Of these, privateers ransomed 507, approximately 15 percent. Inthree of these years no ransoms were recorded. When these years are excluded,the percentage of British merchantmen that entered plunder contracts with theircaptors rises to nearly 19 percent. To put this in perspective, the Royal Navysucceeded in retaking only 495 British merchantmen seized by privateers (Wrightand Fayle 1928 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos857620]:156). Thus plunder contracts “saved” more British merchantmen than thegovernment's official navy. According to Senior (1918: 57), in the same warFrench privateers ransomed more British merchantmen than they returned to prizecourts with.Other data on the frequency of plunder contracts suggest they were still morecommon. Between 1688 and 1697, during the War of the Grand Alliance, Frenchprivateers leaving from St. Malo, one of France's major privateering ports,ransomed more than 30 percent of all merchantmen they captured. Between 1702 and1712, during the War of the Spanish Succession, these privateers ransomed nearly24 percent of all prizes they captured (Crowhurst 1977[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos806304]: 18–19). In thesesame years Dunkirk and Calais privateers ransomed more British and Dutchmerchantmen than they took to prize court, nearly 56 percent of those theyseized. All told, during the War of the Spanish Succession, French privateersentered plunder contracts with 2,118 merchantmen, almost 30 percent of the totalnumber they captured (Bromley 1987[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos800870]: 67, 223).Although plunder contracts were a common feature of eighteenth- andnineteenth-century maritime marauding, they were less common than traditionalplunder was. Many privateers chose to plunder their victims in the usual wayinstead of through Coasean bargains. These privateer-merchantman interactionsfailed to satisfy the previously discussed conditions required for plundercontracts to be formed. Privateers and merchantmen misjudged each other'sstrength, plunder contracts proved unenforceable, the transaction costs ofbargaining proved prohibitively high, and privateers’ cost of producing plundertraditionally was sometimes low, shrinking the benefit of plunder contracts.Coasean agreements weren't possible in these cases, so privateers plunderedwithout them. Because of this, conflict between privateers and merchantmen thatdestroyed valuable resources occurred, privateers expended resources draggingevery captured merchantman back to shore for prize court adjudication, andmerchantmen lost their vessels, cargoes, and crewmembers’ freedom. Plunder'ssocial losses in such cases stood where conventional wisdom suggests they alwaysare: at their maximum.In some cases merchantmen fought their privateering aggressors because theymisjudged their strength. Although in many cases a merchantman could conclude byvirtue of coming under attack that it was weaker and likely to lose in a violentcontest, privateers could miscalculate their own strength leading them tomistakenly assault stronger vessels. The average privateer was much strongerthan the average merchantman. But owing to the variation in privateer strengthsnoted earlier, that didn't preclude some privateers from being weaker than somemerchantmen. If the former erred in which ship they attacked, a fight was likelyto result.In February 1815 Captain Boyle's American privateer, the Chasseur, spotted aninnocent-looking schooner with only three gun ports and made for her. Imaginethe Chasseur's surprise when, upon closing on her, the schooner revealed sevenhidden gun ports. The formidable ten-gun quarry proved to be His Majesty's St.Lawrence. The Chasseur prevailed that day but was prizeless for her efforts. TheSt. Lawrence was “a perfect wreck in her hull and had scarcely a Sail or RopeStanding” (Garitee 1977[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813837]: 161). TheChasseur, too, sustained damage to her rigging and sails from the battle besidelosing five men and having seven injured.Merchantmen were capable of making their own mistakes, wrongly believing theywere stronger than their assaulter, in which case they may hazard a conflictrather than negotiating a Coasean agreement, again preventing more efficientplunder.23 In January 1813 Captain Stafford's American privateer, the Dolphin,engaged two merchantmen off the coast of St. Vincent. The merchantmen didn'tyield to the Dolphin's advances, believing their joint strength was enough tooverwhelm the Dolphin. They were wrong. Although the merchantmen's joint forceswere in fact superior to the privateer's, the Dolphin proved more effective with10 guns and 60 men than the merchantmen did with more than twice as many gunsand five more men (Coggeshall 1856[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos804241]: 128).Unfortunately the merchantmen didn't realize their mistaken judgment until afterthe bloody battle that led to their capture.In other cases Coasean plunder agreements weren't created because they couldn'tbe enforced. In 1782 the British government legally barred its merchantmen fromentering plunder contracts with privateers. In 1793 it prohibited Britishprivateers from entering plunder contracts with their merchantman victims.Similarly, in 1756 France began restricting its citizens’ use of plundercontracts. First the government forbade French privateers from ransomingmerchantmen until they had brought at least three prizes to port. Then in 1782the French government prohibited its citizens from entering plunder contracts asplunderers or victims. After these years neither the British nor Frenchgovernment could be relied on to help enforce plunder contracts against theircitizens.Because they benefited from them, some British and French merchantmen continuedto enter plunder contracts with privateers despite their governments’ ban.British merchantmen continued to offer ransom bills to American privateersthroughout the War of 1812, a full thirty years after parliament criminalizedsuch contracts (see, for instance, Garitee 1977[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813837]: 272; Petrie 1999[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos838048]: 22–23). AndAmerican privateers continued to accept them, relying on the threat ofrepossession for enforcement.Privateers remained “justified in their expectations of payment” from Britishand French victims even after their governments criminalized plunder contracts“because the vessels were merchant ships.” As noted earlier, “A merchant shipowner who didn't pay his obligations simply couldn't trade in foreign ports inthe future or his vessel would be seized there by his creditors” (Petrie 1999[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos838048]: 23). Because ofthis, Britain's and France's plunder contract prohibitions had a muted effect onforeign privateers’ ability to enforce the terms of their bargains with Britishand French merchantmen. But they did have some effect, namely in those cases inwhich repossession was insufficient to ensure contractual compliance. Someassaulted commercial vessels, such as Arctic whalers, had no occasion to everdock at a foreign port where they could be seized on behalf of the privateer towhom they were indebted, rendering this enforcement mechanism useless (see, forinstance, Petrie 1999[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos838048]: 23–24).Although problems relating to asymmetric information and enforcement areresponsible for why some Coasean plunder agreements were never negotiated,problems relating to the benefit of such agreements in certain cases, and thetransaction cost of creating them in others, are probably the reasons mostprivateer-merchantman plunder agreements failed to get off the ground. Aprivateer confronted a trade-off when deciding how to proceed with a capturedmerchantman. As my theory highlights, negotiating a plunder contract with avictim merchantman had value to the privateer because it could avoid certaincosts of producing plunder by doing so. These costs resulted from the time andrisk associated with going back and forth between sea and prize court, giving upmen to form a prize crew, and carrying and providing for a capturedmerchantman's sailors.However, several of these costs were minimized if the privateer was seizing itsfinal prize for the expedition. Even a well-provisioned privateer couldn'tplunder forever. Many privateers couldn't last longer than the time it took toseize a single prize, especially considering that many weren't full-timeplunderers but were employed in commerce instead. Because privateers had toreturn to port after seizing their final prize, the time and risk they hazardedin traveling home, and the men they sacrificed to form a prize crew, were coststhey incurred whether they contracted with victim merchantmen or not. Only thecost of providing for the captured merchant crew's sailors could be avoided bynegotiating such an agreement. In these cases the gains from a plunderer-victimCoasean bargain were small.In March 1815 Captain Matthews's Baltimore privateer, the Ultor, was cruisingwhen Matthews heard from a passing American ship that the war was over (Garitee1977 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813837]: 155). TheUltor could plunder vessels on its way back to Baltimore, but in couldn't resumeplundering after that. Because the victims the Ultor encountered on its way homeat war's end would be its last, the privateer couldn't save time that could bespent plundering, travel costs of going back to port, or avoid the dangers ofventuring to a prize court with its prizes by entering plunder contracts withthese victims. So Matthews plundered the foreign merchantmen he encountered onhis return home in the tradition fashion: without a Coasean contract.In addition to the smallness of privateers’ potential gains of using plundercontracts in some cases, the transaction costs of negotiating plunder agreementscould be large. Earlier in this essay I discussed how high transaction costs ofnegotiating Coasean agreements prevented privateers and merchantmen from usingsuch agreements to reduce the cost of defensive investments by merchantmen. Insome cases high transaction costs also precluded Coasean contracts that couldreduce the cost of producing plunder and the deadweight loss of destruction.Recall the bargaining problem created by the bilateral monopoly situation thatprivateers and victim merchantmen confronted. The market for vessels and cargoesthat merchantmen carried helped narrow privateers’ and merchantmen's bargainingrange, reducing these costs. But in other cases the vessel and cargo were worthlittle. In these situations the majority of the price a privateer could extractfrom its victim merchantman was based on the value the merchant crewmembers’attached to their freedom.Here there was no market to narrow the bargaining window. The transaction costsof negotiation in these cases threatened to be large – large enough to trump thepotential gains from plunderer-victim exchange, particularly if such gains weresmall in the first place because the privateer was heading home anyway. Indeed,when a captured vessel and cargo were worth little, even traditional plundercould be more costly than it was worth, leading the captor to simply release itsvictim. When the Yankee overwhelmed the British schooner Ceres, theprivateersmen were disappointed to find she was carrying only produce. “As thisvessel was of little value she was released after some articles of value to hercaptors had been taken out” (Maclay 1900[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos830707]: 271; see also272).It's impossible to reduce plunder's social cost to zero. Thus a world ofperpetual plunder necessarily fares worse than one without it. But this doesn'tmean the former world faces unbounded violence and destruction. Plunderers havestrong incentives to engage in activities that minimize plunder's social cost.In doing so they promote more efficient plunder, limiting how Hobbesian even aHobbesian jungle can become.This has important implications for how we think about even “worst case”anarchy. It suggests that even if the Hobbesian prediction that withoutgovernment individuals will be locked into a state of war with another wereright, the welfare implications ordinarily drawn from that prediction will oftenbe wrong. Life in an anarchic world of warfare will be nasty, brutish, andshort. But it will often be less nasty, less brutish, and less short than Hobbesor conventional wisdom following him suggests.* This chapter is based on and uses material from Leeson, Peter T., and AlexNowrasteh. 2011 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos826200].“Was Privateering Plunder Efficient?” Journal of Economic Behavior andOrganization 79(3): 303–317 [© 2011 Elsevier B.V.]. 1 For the classic discussion of the welfare costs of theft, and theirsimilarity to the welfare costs of monopolies and rent-seeking, see Tullock(1967 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos850469]). 2 Leeson (2010 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos825555]a)discusses mutiny on eighteenth-century merchantmen and the institutions thatmerchant sailors devised to overcome the collective action problem of maritimerebellions. 3 For one influential model of the social cost of plunder, see Buchanan (1975[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos801008]).

Fora discussion of this law, its emergence, and its enforcement, see Anderson andGifford (1995 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos793181]). 10 Such duties could be extremely high, in some cases consuming 30–40 percentof a prize's value (see, for instance, Garitee, 1977[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813837]: 183; see alsoLydon, 1970 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos830562]: 91).However, to further encourage privateering, at various times some colonialgovernments exempted privateer-obtained booty from onerous customs (Swanson 1991[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos848614]: 15). 11 This wasn't the only reason a prize may be adjudged “bad,” but it was themain one. The British government also prohibited its privateers from “breakingbulk,” that is, disposing of plundered cargo before a prize court had adjudgedit legitimate (although exceptions for unusual circumstances were permitted).This was another ground on which a prize may be adjudged illegitimate. Accordingto a letter of marque issued to an East Indiaman in 1694 for plundering Frenchmerchant shipping, for example, “you are to keep in safety all such ships,vessels, and goods, which shall be taken in your voyages outward or homeward,and not break bulk, sell, wast, spoil, or diminish the same before judgment befirst given in our Admiralty court in England or the East Indies respectively”(Admiralty Court Miscellanea 862, 1694; see also, Admiralty Court PrizeSentences 21, No. 140, 1697). 12 Alternatively a privateer could place its prisoners on a ship and send themhome after having them sign a declaration certifying their capture and release,which the privateer's government could then present to its enemy along with arequest for the release of an equivalent number of its citizens held prisoner.For an example of this, see Fanning (1912[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos811237]: 187). For anexample of an impromptu arrangement for prisoner exchange between a Frenchprivateer and its British prize, see Admiralty Secretary in Letters (3382, April12, 1747). 13 Besides the fact that governments punished their citizens who violated rulesabout prisoner treatment, privateers were also encouraged to comply with theserules through the use of bounties in certain cases. Governments sometimesoffered “head money” for each sailor on an enemy merchant ship (or navy vessel)that a privateer overwhelmed. Returning home with prisoners was the mostconvincing (albeit not the only) way to evidence what head money was due andthus to collect bounties owed. In addition to this, recall that prize courtsrelied on the two or three merchant sailors taken captive by a privateer totestify at its prize hearing. If privateers hoped for favorable testimony, itbehooved them not to mistreat these prisoners. 14 Still another social cost of privateering plunder manifested in the form ofdefensive investments by merchantmen was the cost of training merchant sailorsto be adept at seaborne conflict. 15 On the contrary, insurance could actually encourage privateer attacksbecause it made merchantmen more likely to acquiesce in the face of a privateerattack. 16 The merchantman's provisions could be seized to help address this problem.But any provisions that had to be used to support captured merchant sailors wereprovisions the privateer couldn't enjoy the revenues of from being sold atauction at a prize court. 17 While schooners were fore-and-aft rigged, brigs were square rigged. 18 Anderson and Gifford (1991[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos792988]: 114) note thatfollowing war's end smaller privateers were often sold as merchantmen, similarlysuggesting privateers’ low-cost convertibility. 19 Besides adding a few guns, the only other notable way in which a merchantmanwas modified to make her fit for a letter of marque was perhaps somereinforcement of the bulwarks and additional siding to make her sturdier. 20 Contrast this situation with the situation navy warships confronted.Although these vessels were primarily concerned with handling enemy navywarships rather than enemy commercial vessels, they, too, could and occasionallydid assault merchant ships. However, unlike privateers, which were often no morethan slightly modified merchant ships, the plunderous capital embodied in navyships was highly specific. These ships were designed exclusively for warfare andhad no commercial use. They were massive, built to engage in and withstand heavyfire, and carried an extraordinary number of guns. Naval vessels’ gains fromentering Coasean exchanges with their victims were therefore smaller than thatof privateers, leading them to enter them less often and engage in traditionalplunder more often instead. 21 Although, for a discussion of an exception, see Senior (1918[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos844253]: 54). 22 If the hostage wasn't the ship captain, the captain might be tempted toransom the ship fraudulently to secure its release – that is, to enter a plundercontract for a price that exceeded the ship's and its cargo's value withoutintending to honor the agreement. However, this was prevented by two factors.First, as I discussed previously, privateers had an idea of the market value ofships and their cargoes, limiting merchant captains’ ability to get away withsuch fraud. Second, the hostage had a right of action against his captain forfraud if his captain did this (see, for instance, Marsden 1915[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos830865]–1916: vol. 2,398). 23 On the ways in which pirates sought to overcome the informational asymmetryregarding their strength and identity vis-à-vis merchantmen in the eighteenthcentury, see Leeson (2010[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos825555]b)."},{"pageContent":"Part III Self-Governance and the Problem of “Bad Apples”"},{"pageContent":"6 Pirates’ Private Order*The previous chapters considered self-governance among persons who earned atleast part of their living, and thus spent at least part of their time, inpeaceful, productive economic activities. Privateersmen were only part-timeplunderers. When their countries weren't at war, most of them worked in merchantshipping. Even the Anglo-Scottish border reivers, who, as we saw severalchapters ago, had a penchant for raiding one another, spent at least part oftheir time producing something to steal. And not every borderer engaged inreiving. Here I consider a different and, in at least one important sense, moredifficult problem situation for anarchy – one in which society consistsexclusively of “bad apples”: persons who choose to earn a living solely bytheft, murder, and violating other important social rules.Bad apples may be “bad” because they lack the internal constraints, thecooperation-enhancing “moral compasses” most other people have that prevent themfrom taking advantage of every opportunity for privately profitable but sociallydestructive behavior. All persons are tempted to behave opportunistically whenmaterial costs and benefits make doing so profitable. But within some bounds, atleast, most persons are also guided by nonmaterial, “internal” costs andbenefits that depress the ultimate payoff of, for example, stealing from othersand increase the ultimate payoff of be-having honestly toward them. Moralcompasses increase the likelihood of cooperative behavior even whereuncooperative behavior has no chance of being detected, and thus no chance ofbeing punished, by others. Feelings of guilt or, on the other side,self-respect, for example, can produce some degree of cooperation whether othergovernance mechanisms exist or not. Bad apples may also be “bad” because they'reexcessively impatient. Criminal punishments sufficient to deter more patientpersons from seeking a living by breaking social rules, or to deter persons“naturally” more inclined to behave cooperatively along the previously discussedlines from doing so, may be insufficient to deter persons with exceptionallyhigh discount rates from seeking to earn a living this way.There are surely other reasons why some persons may be willing to earn theirlivings through theft and murder. But these two are sufficient to highlight thedaunting challenge that the most notable societies composed exclusively of badapples confront in trying to achieve social order through self-governance:outlaw societies. Outlaw societies tend to be composed of the very sorts ofpeople that any governance arrangement has the most difficulty controlling:persons whose moral compasses are nonexistent or deficient from the perspectiveof cooperation, and persons who are extraordinarily myopic. How, then, can weexpect individuals committed to stealing and killing to secure social order?From where might so-called honor among thieves spring?Clearly not from government. Outlaw societies are outside the laws and means ofenforcement enjoyed by legitimate persons in legitimate societies governed bystates. Yet, like societies composed mostly of legitimate persons, thoseconsisting exclusively of bad apples require governance too. Their criminalenterprises require social cooperation, albeit for the purpose of exploitingothers, no less than legitimate persons’ enterprises do. If societies of badapples fail to govern themselves, their very livelihoods, which depend on theirability to coordinate for profitable theft and violence, evaporate. Thus eventhe members of criminal societies have strong incentives to make self-governancework. And they do.To see how, I examine history's most notorious outlaw society: that of Caribbeanpirates. Pirates are known for raucousness, recklessness, and chaotic rapine.But pirate reality is quite another picture. Real-life pirates were highlyorganized criminals. Unlike the swashbuckling psychopaths of fiction, historicalpirates displayed sophisticated organization and coordination.These “most treacherous rogues” terrorized the Caribbean and the Atlantic andIndian oceans during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Pirates formed aloose confederation of maritime bandits outside the law of any government.Despite this, they successfully cooperated with hundreds of other rogues. Amidubiquitous potential for conflict, pirates rarely fought, stole from, ordeceived one another. In fact, piratical harmony was as common as harmony amongtheir lawful contemporaries who relied on government for social cooperation. Asone pirate contemporary put it (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 527):“Nature, we see, teaches the most Illiterate the necessary Prudence for theirPreservation…these Men whom we term, and not without Reason, the Scandal ofhuman Nature, who were abandoned to all Vice, and lived by Rapine; when theyjudged it for their Interest…were strictly just…among themselves.”To organize their banditry effectively, pirates required mechanisms ofself-governance to prevent internal predation, minimize crew conflict, andmaximize piratical profit. Pirates devised two institutions for this purpose.First, I analyze the system of piratical checks and balances that crews used toconstrain captain predation. Second, I examine how pirates used democraticconstitutions to minimize conflict and create piratical law and order.Remarkably, pirates adopted both of these institutions before seventeenth- andeighteenth-century governments did.My discussion draws on a series of historical documents that provide a firsthandglimpse into their organization.1 The first of these is Captain CharlesJohnson's General History of the Pyrates (1726–1728), which contains reports onseveral of history's most notorious pirates, related by a pirate contemporary. Ialso draw on Alexander Exquemelin's (1678[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos811071]) invaluableaccount of the seventeenth-century buccaneers. Exquemelin was a surgeon whosailed with the buccaneers, and he provides a detailed, firsthand account oftheir raids, system of rules, and social organization. The buccaneer WilliamDampier (1697[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos807350]–1707) alsopublished a journal relating to his maritime exploits, of which I make use aswell.Buccaneers differed from “pure” pirates in that they frequently plundered shipswith government sanction. However, many other times they plundered withoutofficial permission, as full-blown pirates. These proto-pirates, many of whomturned to pure piracy when governments stopped issuing licenses for plunder,influenced and anticipated the organization of pure pirates in the lateseventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Buccaneer records are thereforeimportant for understanding the institutions and organization of seventeenth-and eighteenth-century pirates.In addition to these sources, the Calendar of Colonial Office Papers, whichcontains correspondence between colonial governors and their central governmentsrelating to piracy, and records from the trials of various pirates, such astestimony from individuals taken prisoner by pirate ships and the testimony ofpirates themselves, form an important part of the historical record on whichthis essay relies.2 Finally, a few pirate captives, such as William Snelgrave(1734 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos846914]), whosecaptors ultimately released them, published longer works describing theirharrowing captivity by pirate crews.3 I also draw on these accounts, whichprovide important firsthand records describing piratical governance andorganization.4A “Nest of Rogues”Seventeenth- and eighteenth-century pirates occupied the waterways that formedmajor trading routes.5 These included the waters surrounding the Bahamas thatstood between ships traveling from Central America to Spain, the watersconnecting Europe and the North American sea coast, those between Cuba andHaiti, which separated ships traveling from Europe and the west coast of Africato Jamaica, and the waters around Madagascar traveled by ships sailing to andfrom India (Cordingly 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos805455]: 88). These areasencompass major portions of the Atlantic and Indian oceans, the Caribbean Sea,and the Gulf of Mexico. The trade routes connecting the Caribbean, NorthAmerica's Atlantic sea coast, and Madagascar consequently formed a loop calledthe “Pirate Round” that many pirates traveled in search of prey.The “Golden Age” of piracy, when pirates were at their strongest, extended from1690 to 1730 (Konstam 2002[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos823801]: 94).6 The yearsfrom 1716 to 1722 mark the height of the Golden Age. “This was at a Time thatthe Pyrates had obtained such an Acquisition of Strength, that they were in noConcern about preserving themselves from the Justice of Laws” (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 87). Thepirates of this era include many well-known sea robbers, such as Blackbeard –whose real name was Edward Teach – Bartholomew Roberts, “Calico” Jack Rackam,and others.Pirates were a diverse lot.7 A sample of 700 pirates active in the Caribbeanbetween 1715 and 1725 reveals that 35 percent were English, 25 percent wereAmerican, 20 percent were from West Indies, 10 percent were Scottish, 8 percentwere from Wales, and 2 percent were from Sweden, Holland, France, and Spain(Konstam 2002 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos823801]:9). Others came from Portugal, Scandinavia, Greece, and East India (Marx 1996[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos831326]b: 103).Pirate crews were also racially diverse. Based on data available fromtwenty-three pirate crews active between 1682 and 1726, the racial compositionof ships varied between 13 percent and 98 percent black. If this sample isrepresentative, 25–30 percent of the average pirate crew was of African descent(Kinkor 2001 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos822356]:200–201).The pirate population is difficult to measure precisely, but by all accounts itwas considerable.8 According to the reports of contemporaries and estimates ofpirate historians, in any one year between 1716 and 1722, the loop that formedthe Pirate Round contained between 1,000 and 2,000 sea bandits (see, forinstance, Konstam 2002[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos823801]: 6; Marx 1996[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos831326]b: 102, 111;Pringle 1953 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos839242]:185; Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 132;Rediker 2006 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840580]:256).9 The buccaneering community of the seventeenth century must have been evenlarger than this; as I discuss later in this chapter, some firsthand observersreport single expeditions of 2,000 men (Exquemelin 1678[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos811071]: 171).Contrary to most people's images of pirate crews, they were quite large. Basedon figures from thirty-seven pirate ships between 1716 and 1726, the averagecrew had about eighty members (Rediker 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840580]: 256; see also,Deposition of Simon Calderon 1682, Public Record Office, Colonial Office PapersI: 50, no. 139). A number of pirate crews were closer to 120, and crews of150–200 weren't uncommon (see, for instance, Snelgrave 1734[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos846914]: 199; Examinationof John Brown May 6, 1717, Suffolk Court Files, no. 11945, paper 5; Depositionof Theophilus Turner June 8, 1699, Public Record Office, Colonial Office Papers5: 714, no. 70 VI; Examination of John Dann, August 3, 1696, London, PublicRecord Office, Colonial Office Papers 323: 2, no. 25; Deposition of AdamBaldridge, May 5, 1699, Public Record Office, Colonial Office Papers 5: 1042,no. 30 II; Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 442;Cordingly 2006 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos805455]:165).Several pirate crews were larger than this. For example, Blackbeard's crewaboard the Queen Anne's Revenge was 300 men strong (Public Record Office,Colonial Office Papers 152/12, no. 67, iii; see also, Marx 1996[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos831326]b: 112).10 Even asixth-rate Royal Navy ship in the early eighteenth century carried more crewmembers than the average pirate vessel (about 150). But compared to the averagemerchant ship, which carried only thirteen to seventeen men, pirate ships wereextremely large (Rediker 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840580]: 107).Furthermore, some pirate crews were too large to fit in one ship. In this casethey formed pirate squadrons. Captain Bartholomew Roberts, for example,commanded a squadron of 4 ships that carried 508 men (Cordingly 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos805455]: 111).In addition to this, pirate ships sometimes joined for concerted plunderingexpeditions. The most impressive fleets of sea bandits belong to the buccaneers.Alexander Exquemelin (1678: 171), for example, records that Captain Morgancommanded a fleet of 37 ships and 2,000 men sufficient to attack coastalcommunities on the Spanish Main. Elsewhere he refers to a group of buccaneerswho “had a force of at least twenty vessels in quest of plunder” (Exquemelin1678 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos811071]: 69; seealso 85, 105, 93). Similarly, William Dampier records a pirating expedition thatboasted 10 ships and 960 men (Dampier 1697[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos807350]–1707: 62).11Although their fleets weren't as massive, eighteenth-century pirates also“cheerfully joined their Brethren in Iniquity” to engage in multi-crew piratingexpeditions (Snelgrave 1734[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos846914]: 198).Merchant Ship OrganizationAlthough some pirates came from the Royal Navy, most sailors who entered piracycame from the merchant marine. Merchant ships were organized hierarchically.12On top was the captain, below him were his officers, and far below these wereordinary seamen. This hierarchy empowered captains with autocratic authorityover their crews. The captain's authority gave him control over all aspects oflife aboard his ship, including victual provision, wage payment, laborassignment and, of course, crew member discipline.Merchant ship autocracy reflected a sensible institutional response to thespecific economic situation these ships confronted and, in particular, theownership structure of merchant vessels. Merchant ships were owned by groups oftypically a dozen or more landed merchants who purchased shares in varioustrading vessels and financed their voyages.13 In addition to supplying thecapital required for ships’ construction and continued maintenance, ownersoutfitted their vessels, supplied them with provisions, advanced sailor wages,and, most importantly, solicited customers (who were other landed merchants) andnegotiated terms of delivery and freight.Merchant ship owners were absentee owners of their vessels. They didn't sail ontheir ships.14 They were landlubbers. Most merchant ship owners didn't want totake their chances with brutal life at sea, and in any event could earn more byspecializing in their area of expertise – investment and commercial organization– hiring seamen to sail their ships instead.15 Because of this, merchant shipowners confronted a principal-agent problem with respect to the crews theyhired. Once a ship left port, it could be gone for months.16 At sea the owners’ship was beyond their watchful eyes or reach. Thus ship owners couldn't monitortheir sailors directly.This situation invited various kinds of sailor opportunism. Such opportunismincluded negligence in caring for the ship, carelessness that damaged cargo,liberality with provisions, embezzlement of freight or advances required tofinance the vessel's voyage, and outright theft of the vessel itself. To preventthis, ship owners appointed captains to their vessels to monitor crews in theirstead. Centralizing power in a captain's hands to direct sailors’ tasks, controlthe distribution of victuals and payment, and discipline and punish crew membersallowed merchant ship owners to minimize sailor opportunism. Because merchantships tended to be quite small, captains could cheaply monitor sailors’ behaviorto prevent activities (or inactivities) that were costly to ship owners andsecure sailors’ full effort.17Admiralty law facilitated captains’ ability to do this by granting themauthority to control their crews’ behavior through corporal punishment. The lawempowered captains to beat crew members with the infamous (and ominous)cat-o-nine-tails, imprison them, and administer other forms of harsh physical“correction” to sailors who disobeyed orders or shirked their duties. It alsopermitted captains to dock sailors’ wages for damaging or stealing cargo and forinsubordination.To align owner-captain interests, owners used two devices. First, they hiredcaptains who held small shares in the vessels they were commanding or, barringthis, gave small shares to their captains who didn't. Merchant ship captainscontinued to draw regular fixed wages like the other sailors on their vessels.18But unlike regular sailors, captains became partial residual claimants of theships they controlled, aligning their interests with those of absentee owners.19Second, whenever possible, absentee owners appointed captains with familialconnections to one of the members of their group (Davis 1962[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos807997]: 128). Thisensured that captains didn't behave opportunistically at the absentee owners’expense because, if they did, they were more likely to face punishment.20The reason merchant ship owners required autocratic captains to effectivelyserve their interests is straightforward. A captain who didn't have totalauthority over his crew couldn't monitor and control sailors’ behaviorsuccessfully. Reducing the captain's power over victuals, payments, laborassignment, or discipline and vesting it in some other sailor's hands insteadwould have concomitantly reduced the captain's power to make sailors behave inthe absentee owners’ interest.Similarly, if merchant ship owners didn't appoint their captains as thepermanent commanders of their voyages, but instead permitted a ship's sailors topopularly depose the captain and elect another member of the crew to this officeat their will, the captain's capacity as acting manager of the ship's absenteeowners would cease to exist. To see this, simply imagine the kind of captainmerchant sailors would elect if given the power to select him democratically.Sailors’ interests were best served by a lax, liberal captain who let them do asthey pleased – exactly the opposite sort of captain that best served the owners’interests. Merchant ship autocracy was therefore essential to overcoming theowner-crew principal-agent problem, and thus to merchant ship profitability.Merchant ship autocracy worked quite well in this respect. While some sailorsstill managed to steal from the ships on which they sailed, disobey command, andin several cases mutiny and abscond with the owners’ ship, these were relativelyunimportant exceptions to the general rule whereby merchant sailors, under theauthority of autocratic captains, served their absentee owners’ interests.The Problem of Captain PredationAlthough merchant ship autocracy largely overcame the principal-agent problemthat absentee owners confronted with respect to their crews, in doing so itcreated potential for a different kind of problem: captain predation. Thetrouble was that a captain endowed with the authority required to manage hiscrew on the ship owners’ behalf could also easily turn that authority againsthis seamen for personal benefit. As British marine commander William Betagh(1728 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos798850]: 41)characterized the problem, “unlimited power, bad views, ill nature and illprinciples all concurring” “in a ship's commander,” “he is past all restraint.”Betagh's opinion of some captains’ “ill-nature” notwithstanding, merchantcaptains weren't necessarily bad men. But they were rational and thus respondedto the incentives their institutional environment created. Endowed withautocratic authority over their crews, some merchant captains used the powertheir employers and Admiralty law gave them to prey on their sailors. As aresult of merchant ships’ autocratic organization, one eighteenth-centuryobserver remarked, “a Captain is like a King at Sea, and his Authority is overall that are in his Possession” (Bishop 1744[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos798988]: 78).21 Captains“had absolute authority over the mates, the carpenters and boatswain, and theseamen.” They had the power to “make life tolerable or unbearable as theywished” (Davis 1962[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos807997]: 131–132).Unfortunately for seamen, more than a few captains opted for the latter.Merchant captain mistreatment of ordinary seamen was largely responsible fordriving sailors from this profession into the arms of sea bandits. The pirateJohn Archer's last words before being put to death testify to this. As helamented, “I could wish that Masters of Vessels would not use their Men with somuch Severity, as many of them do, which exposes us to great Temptations”(Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 351). In1726 the pirate William Fly pleaded similarly at his death sentence. “OurCaptain and his Mate used us Barbarously. We poor Men can't have Justice done.There is nothing said to our Commanders, let them never so much abuse us, anduse us like Dogs” (Rediker 1981[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840203]: 218).Captain predation took several forms, each the result of abusing the autocraticpower captains had at their disposal. Predatory captains cut sailors’ victualrations to keep costs down or to leave more for them and their fellow officersto consume. As one sailor testified, for example, although the members of hiscrew “were att short allowance and wanted bread,” the officers “wereallowed…their full allowance of provisions and liquors as if there had been nowant of scarcity of any thing on board” (Babb v. Chalkley 1701, High Court ofAdmiralty Papers, 24/127).22 Predatory captains also fraudulently dockedsailors’ wages or paid sailors in debased colonial currency (Morris 1965[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos835327]: 237; Rediker2006 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840580]). They mightalso voyage to locations where the crew hadn't contracted to sail (Gifford 1993[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos814857]: 144).To keep their hungry and uncomfortable men in check, abusive captains could anddid use all manner of objects aboard their ships as weapons to punish insolentcrew members. They hit sailors in the head with tackle or other hard objects onboard, crushing their faces, and used other barbaric tactics to disciplineseamen (Jones v. Newcomin 1735, High Court of Admiralty Papers, 24/138).23 Asmerchant ship captain Nathaniel Uring (1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos853680]: 176–177)described how he dealt with a “seditious Fellow” on his ship, for instance, “Igave him two or three such Strokes with a Stick I had prepared for thatpurpose…the Blood running about his Ears, he pray'd for God's sake that I notkill him.”Besides preventing dissension, captains also used their kingly power to settlepersonal scores with crew members. Admiralty law considered interfering withcaptain punishment mutinous and thus prohibited crew members from doing so(Morris 1965 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos835327]:264–265). Given that captains effectively defined when punishment waslegitimate, they were free to abuse seamen at will. As one seaman warned anewcomer, “There is no justice or injustice on board ship, my lad. There areonly two things: duty and mutiny – mind that. All that you are ordered to do isduty. All that you refuse to do is mutiny” (Rediker 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840580]: 211).24Pirate Ship OrganizationLike merchant ship organization, the particular economic situation pirate shipsconfronted crucially shaped their organization. Most notably, pirates didn'tconfront the owner-crew principal-agent problem that merchant ships did. Thereason for this is simple enough: pirates didn't acquire their shipslegitimately. They stole them.25Because of this, pirate ships had no absentee owners. On a pirate ship theprincipals were the agents. As one historian described it, in this sense apirate ship was like a “sea-going stock company” (Pringle 1953[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos839242]: 106). Thus,unlike merchant ships, pirate ships didn't require captains to align the crew'sinterests with those of the ship's absentee owners.But they did require captains. Many important piratical decisions, such as howto engage a potential target, the method to pursue when “chasing” a target orbeing chased by authorities, and how to react if attacked, required snapdecision making. There wasn't time for disagreement or debate in such cases, andconflicting voices would have made it impossible to undertake the most essentialtasks. Furthermore, pirate ships, like all ships – indeed, more than other ships– needed some method of maintaining order, distributing victuals, payments, andadministering discipline to unruly crew members.The office of captain overcame such difficulties by vesting control over thesematters in the hands of an authority. In this sense, although pirate shipsdiffered from merchant ships in requiring captains to solve an owner-sailorprincipal-agent problem, pirate ships were similar to merchant ships inrequiring some kind of authority for their undertakings’ success. While a pirateship's activity – maritime theft – was wholly different from that of a merchantship, both kinds of vessels shared the need to create internal order to achievetheir ends.Indeed, the difficulty pirate ships confronted in their need for authority wasconsiderably greater than that which merchant ships confronted. While thehistorical record contains plenty of charges of merchant captain predation,merchant sailors, at least, could rely on government to deter some captainpredation. English law, for example, included several legal protections thatwere supposed to insulate sailors from captain abuse. And merchant seamen could,and sometimes did, take predatory captains to court for their actions.As outlaws, pirates were out of luck in this regard. They couldn't rely ongovernment protection from predatory captains at all. Furthermore, pirates’captains, who were, like all pirates, professional outlaws, were men with ademonstrated willingness to use theft and violence to get what they wanted.The need for captains therefore posed a serious dilemma for pirates. On the onehand, a captain who wielded unquestioned authority in certain decisions wascritical for success. On the other hand, what was to prevent a captain with thispower from behaving toward his pirate crew in the same manner that predatorymerchant ship captains behaved toward their crews or, more likely, still worse?Because pirates didn't have absentee owners but instead jointly owned the stolenships on which they sailed, although they required captains, unlike merchantships, they didn't require autocratic captains. Thus, in sharp contrast to thesituation on merchant ships, pirates could and did democratically elect theircaptains without problem. The pirates sailing a particular ship were both theprincipals and the agents, so democracy didn't threaten to lead to captains whoserved the agents at the principals’ expense. On the contrary, pirate democracyensured that pirates got precisely the kind of captains they desired. Becausepirates could popularly depose any captain who didn't suit them and electanother in his place, pirate captains’ ability to prey on crew members wasgreatly constrained compared to merchant ship captains.Similarly, because pirates were both principals and agents of their ships, theycould divide authority on their vessels to further check captains’ ability toabuse crew members without loss. Unlike merchant ships, which couldn't afford aseparation of power because this would have diminished the ability of theabsentee owners’ acting agent (the captain) to make the crew act in the owners’interests, pirate ships could and did adopt a system of democratic checks andbalances.Piratical Checks and BalancesIn light of the threat of captain predation, pirates “were adamant in wanting tolimit the captain's power to abuse and cheat them” (Rogozinski 2000[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos842044]: 174). To do thisthey instituted a democratic system of divided power, or piratical checks andbalances, aboard their ships. As the pirate Walter Kennedy testified at histrial (Hayward 1735[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos818163]: vol. 1, 42):> Most of them having suffered formerly from the ill-treatment of Officers,> provided thus carefully against any such Evil now they had the choice in> themselves…for the due Execution thereof they constituted other Officers> besides the Captain; so very industrious were they to avoid putting too much> Power into the hands of one Man.The primary “other officer” pirates “constituted” for this purpose was thequartermaster. The way this office worked was straightforward. Captains retainedabsolute authority in times of battle, enabling pirates to realize the benefitsof autocratic control required for success in conflict. However, pirate crewstransferred power to allocate provisions, select and distribute loot (there wasrarely room aboard pirate ships to take all they seized from a prize),adjudicate crew member conflicts, and administer discipline to thequartermaster, who they democratically elected (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 213):> For the Punishment of small Offences…there is a principal Officer among the> Pyrates, called the Quarter-Master, of the Men's own choosing, who claims all> Authority this Way, (excepting in Time of Battle) If they disobey his Command,> are quarrelsome and mutinous with one another, misuse Prisoners, plunder> beyond his Order, and in particular, if they be negligent of their Arms, which> he musters at Discretion, he punishes at his own dare without incurring the> Lash from all the Ship's Company: In short, this Officer is Trustee for the> whole, is the first on board any Prize, separating for the Company's Use, what> he pleases, and returning what he thinks fit to the Owners, excepting Gold and> Silver, which they have voted not returnable.William Snelgrave (1734[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos846914]: 199–200), whoobserved the pirates’ system of checks and balances firsthand, characterized therelationship between captain and quartermaster similarly: “the Captain of aPirate Ship, is chiefly chosen to fight the Vessels they may meet with. Besideshim, they chuse another principle Officer, whom they call Quarter-master, whohas the general Inspection of all Affairs, and often controuls the Captain'sOrders.” This separation of power removed captains’ control over activities theytraditionally used to prey on crew members while empowering them sufficiently todirect plundering expeditions.The institutional separation of powers aboard pirate ships predated its adoptionby seventeenth- and eighteenth-century governments. France – and the UnitedStates, for that matter – didn't experience such a separation until 1789. Thefirst specter of separated powers in Spain didn't appear until 1812. Incontrast, pirates had divided, democratic governance aboard their ships at leasta century before this. Arguably, piratical checks and balances predated evenEngland's adoption of similar institutions. England didn't experience aseparation of powers until the Glorious Revolution of 1688. But the buccaneers,who used a similar, if not as thoroughgoing, system of democratically dividedpower as their pure-pirate successors, had in place at least partial democraticchecks and balances in the early 1680s (Rogozinski 2000[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos842044]).Piratical checks and balances proved highly successful. According to Johnson(1726 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 423),as a result of the institution of the quartermaster, aboard pirate ships “theCaptain can undertake nothing which the Quarter-Master does not approve. We maysay, the Quarter-Master is an humble Imitation of the Roman Tribune of thePeople; he speaks for, and looks after the Interest of the Crew.” As notedpreviously, the only exception to this was “in Chase, or in Battle” when crewsdesired autocratic authority and thus, “by their own Laws,” “The Captain's Poweris uncontroulable” (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 139,214).26As noted earlier, in addition to this separation of powers, pirates imposed afurther check to balance captains’ authority. They converted the office to ademocratically elected one, “The Rank of Captain being obtained by the Suffrageof the Majority” (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 214). Thecombination of separated powers and democratic elections for captains ensuredthat pirates “only permit him to be Captain, on Condition, that they may beCaptain over him” (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 213).Crews could vote captains out of office for any number of reasons. Predation wasone reason, but so was cowardice, poor judgment, or any other behavior a crewfelt wasn't in its best interest. In this way pirates could be sure thatcaptainship “falls on one superior for Knowledge and Boldness, Pistol Proof, (asthey call it)” (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 214).The historical record contains numerous examples of pirate crews deposingunwanted captains by majority vote or otherwise removing them from power throughpopular consensus. Captain Charles Vane's pirate crew, for example, popularlydeposed him for cowardice: “the Captain's Behavior was obliged to stand the Testof a Vote, and a Resolution passed against his Honour and Dignity…deposing himfrom the Command” (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 139).Similarly, Captain Christopher Moody's pirate crew grew dissatisfied with hisbehavior and “at last forced him, with twelve others” who supported him “into anopen Boat…and…they were never heard of afterwards” (Snelgrave 1734[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos846914]: 198).27Crews sometimes elected quartermasters who displayed particular valor or keendecision making to replace less capable or honorable captains. For example, whenone pirate crew “went to Voting for a new Captain…the Quarter-Master, who hadbehaved so well in the last Affair…was chosen” (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 479). Thishelped create competition among pirate officers that tended to check theirabuses and encouraged them to serve their crews’ interests.28Pirates took the limitations they imposed on captains’ authority through theirsystem of checks and balances seriously. A speech made by one of the piratesaboard Captain Bartholomew Roberts's ship testifies to this. As he told hiscrew, “should a Captain be so sawcy as to exceed Prescription at any time, whydown with him! it will be a Caution after he is dead to his Successors, of whatfatal Consequence any sort of assuming may be” (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 194–195).This pirate was exaggerating – but only slightly. Crews quickly and readilydeposed old captains and elected new ones when the former overstepped thelimited power crews gave them.The seriousness with which pirates sought to limit their captains’ power isreflected in other ways as well. For instance, unlike aboard merchant vessels,on pirate ships, captains were unable to secure special privileges forthemselves at their crews’ expense. Their lodging, provisions, and even pay werenearly the same as that of ordinary crew members. As Johnson (1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 213–214)described it, aboard pirate ships, “every Man, as the Humour takes him…[may]intrude [the captain's] Apartment, swear at him, seize a part of his Victualsand Drink, if they like it, without his offering to find Fault or contest it.”In other cases, “the Captain himself not being allowed a Bed” had to sleep withrest of the crew in far less comfortable conditions than a captain wouldotherwise be used to (Snelgrave 1734[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos846914]: 217). Or as onepirate fellow-traveler marveled, “even their Captain, or any other Officer, isallowed no more than another Man; nay, the Captain cannot [even] keep his ownCabin to himself” (Downing 1737[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos809823]: 99).29One pirate captive records an event in which the captains of a pirate fleetborrowed fancy clothes that were part of the loot their crews acquired in takinga recent prize. These captains hoped their stolen finery would attract localwomen on the nearby shore. Although the captains intended only to borrow theclothes, the crews became outraged at their captains who they saw astransgressing the limits of their narrowly circumscribed power. As the observerdescribed it, “The Pirate Captains having taken these Cloaths without leave fromthe Quarter-master, it gave great Offence to all the Crew; who alledg'd, ‘Ifthey suffered such things, the Captains would for the future assume a Power, totake whatever they liked for themselves’” (Snelgrave 1734[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos846914]: 257).30One can also get an idea of the effectiveness of piratical checks and balancesby considering the remarks of a pirate contemporary that point to the rarity ofpirate captain predation. Perplexed by an anomalous pirate captain who abusedhis crew, he puzzled, “The captain is very severe to his people, by reason ofhis commission, and caries a very different form from what other Pirates use todo…often calling for his pistols and threatening any that durst speak to thecontrary of what he desireth, to knock out their brains” (Rogozinski 2000[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos842044]: 139; see alsoDeposition of Benjamin Franks October 20, 1697, Public Record Office, ColonialOffice Papers, 323: 2, no. 124).31This success helps explain why, counterintuitively, “the People [piratesovertook] were generally glad of an opportunity of entring with them” (Snelgrave1734 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos846914]: 203).Indeed, pirates frequently “strengthen'd themselves with a great many freshHands, who most of them enter'd voluntarily” (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 170; seealso 228; Deposition of Jeremiah Tay July 6, 1694, Suffolk Court Files, no.3033, paper 6; Colonial Office Papers May 31, 1718, f. 18).32Pirate ConstitutionsPirates’ system of checks and balances prevented captains from preying on theircrews. But a significant problem remained. In vesting many of the powerscaptains typically held in quartermasters instead, what was to preventquartermasters from abusing their authority to benefit privately at crews’expense?As discussed earlier, quartermasters had numerous roles aboard pirate ships.They were in charge of distributing booty, provisions, conflict resolution, andcrew member punishment. This gave them ample latitude to prey on crews. Ialready discussed one check on quartermaster predation, which also checkedcaptain predation: democratic elections. As with their captains, pirate crewselected quartermasters and could depose them if they overstepped theirauthority.But what precisely did this include? Were, for instance, quartermasters free todivide booty and provisions as they saw fit? Could they punish crew members attheir discretion? Furthermore, according to what “laws” were they supposed toadjudicate disputes between those on board?After all, pirates weren't only afraid of captain predation. They opposed anysituation that threatened to jeopardize their ability to cooperate for organizedbanditry, including the institution of the quartermaster. To solve this problem,pirate crews forged written constitutions that specified their laws, punishmentsfor breaking these laws, and more specifically limited the actions thatquartermasters might take in carrying out their duties.Pirate constitutions originated with “articles of agreement” followed onbuccaneer ships in the seventeenth century. The buccaneers called their articlesa chasse-partie. Those articles specified the division of booty among theofficers and crew along with other terms of the buccaneers’ organization. Allsea bandits followed the basic rule of “no prey, no pay.” Unless a piratingexpedition was successful, no man received any payment.Exquemelin (1678 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos811071]:71–72) describes the chasse-partie that governed his crew's expedition indetail:> The buccaneers resolve by common vote where they shall cruise. They also draw> up an agreement or chasse partie, in which is specified what the captain shall> have for himself and for the use of his vessel. Usually they agree on the> following terms. Providing they capture a prize, first of all these amounts> would be deducted from the whole capital. The hunter's pay would generally be> 200 pieces of eight. The carpenter, for his work in repairing and fitting out> the ship, would be paid 100 or 150 pieces of eight. The surgeon would receive> 200 or 250 for his medical supplies, according to the size of the ship.> Then came the agreed awards for the wounded, who might have lost a limb or> suffered injuries. They would be compensated as follows: for the loss of a> right arm, 600 pieces of eight or six slaves; for a left arm 500 pieces of> eight or five slaves. The loss of a right leg also brought 500 pieces of eight> or five slaves in compensation; a left leg 400 or four slaves; an eye, 100 or> one slave, and the same award was made for the loss of a finger. If a man lost> the use of an arm, he would get as much as if it had been cut off, and a> severe internal injury which meant the victim had to have a pipe inserted in> his body would receive 500 pieces of eight or five slaves in recompense.> These amounts having first been withdrawn from the capital, the rest of the> prize would be divided into as many portions as men on the ship. The captain> draws four or five men's portions for the use of the ship, perhaps even more,> and two portions for himself. The rest of the men share uniformly, and the> boys get half a man's share.…> When a ship is robbed, nobody must plunder and keep his loot to himself.> Everything taken – money, jewels, precious stones and goods – must be shared> among them all, without any man enjoying a penny more than his fair share. To> prevent deceit, before the booty is distributed everyone has to swear an oath> on the Bible that he has not kept for himself so much as the value of a> sixpence, whether in silk, linen, wool, gold, silver, jewels, clothes or shot,> from all the capture. And should any man be found to have made a false oath,> he would be banished from the rovers, never more be allowed in their company.Over time the buccaneers institutionalized their articles of agreement andsocial organization. The result was a system of customary law called the Customof the Coast, or the Jamaica Discipline.Eighteenth-century pirates built on this institutional framework in developingtheir own constitutions. Pirates created them “for the better Conservation oftheir Society, and doing Justice to one another” (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 210). Thebasic elements of pirate constitutions displayed great similarity across crews(Rediker 2006 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840580]:261). In describing the articles on Captain Roberts’ ship, for instance, Johnson(1726 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 213)refers to “the Laws of this Company…principle Customs, and Government, of thisroguish Commonwealth; which are pretty near the same with all Pyrates.”Frequent inter-crew interactions led to information sharing that facilitatedconstitutional commonality.33 More than 70 percent of Anglo-American piratesactive between 1716 and 1726, for example, can be connected back to one of threepirate captains: Benjamin Hornigold, George Lowther, or Edward Low (Rediker 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840580]: 267). Thus asignificant proportion of all pirates during this period were associated withone another in some way, via traveling on the same ship, in concert with otherships, and so on.Articles of agreement required unanimous consent. Consequently, piratesdemocratically formed them in advance of launching pirating expeditions. “[A]ll[pirates] swore to ‘em,” sometimes on a Bible or, for one pirate crew, “upon aHatchet for want of a Bible” (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 342). Thesame was true for newcomers who joined pirate companies already under way. Asone observer put it, “When ever any enter on board of these Ships voluntarily,they are obliged to sign all their Articles of Agreement” (Downing 1737[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos809823]: 107). Piratecaptain Howell Davis's crew's articles, for instance, “were signed and sworn toby himself and the rest.” In pirate captain Worley's crew, too, “they all signedArticles” (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 167–168,298). Pirates recognized that “it was every one's Interest to observe them, ifthey were minded to keep up so abominable a Combination” (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 210). Andbecause pirates unanimously agreed to their articles before sailing, the rulesthey established were largely self-enforcing once in place.A crew forged its articles alongside the election of a captain, quartermaster,and occasionally other smaller officers. Pirates sought agreement on theirarticles ex ante “to prevent Disputes and Ranglings afterwards” (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 342). Inthe event a pirate disagreed with their conditions, he was free to searchelsewhere for more satisfactory terms.34 When multiple pirate ships joinedtogether for an expedition, they created similar articles establishing the termsof their partnership. Upon encountering one another at Grand Cayman, forexample, Captain George Lowther's and Edward Low's pirate crews forged such anagreement. Lowther “offering himself as an Ally; Low accepted of the Terms, andso the Treaty was presently sign'd without Plenipo's or any other Formalities”(Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 319).Likewise, crews that objected to the proposed articles or some other element ofan intended multi-ship expedition were free to depart peaceably. In one suchcase, for example, “a Spirit of Discord” emerged between three pirate crewssailing in consort “Upon which…[they] immediately parted, each steering adifferent Course” (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 175).Charles Johnson's records contain several examples of pirate constitutionsthrough which, as one court remarked, these rogues were “wickedly united, andarticled together” (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 253).Consider, for instance, the articles aboard Captain Roberts’ pirate ship(Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 211–212):> > > I. Every Man has a Vote in the Affairs of Moment; has equal Title to the> > > fresh Provisions, or strong Liquors, at any Time seized, and may use them> > > at Pleasure, unless a Scarcity make it necessary, for the Good of all, to> > > vote a Retrenchment.> > > II.

First, it created ademocratic form of governance and explicitly laid out the terms of piratecompensation. This was to clarify the status of property rights aboard pirateships and to prevent officers, such as the captain or the quartermaster, frompreying on crew members. In particular, making the terms of compensationexplicit helped circumscribe the quartermaster's authority in dividing booty.When booty was indivisible, or there was question as to its value and thus howmany shares it counted for in payment, pirates sold or auctioned the troublesomeitems and distributed the divisible proceeds accordingly (Rogozinski 2000[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos842044]: 169; Snelgrave1734 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos846914]). Thispractice prevented conflict between crew members. More important, it constrainedthe discretion of the quartermaster who might otherwise be in a position tocircumvent the terms of compensation when loot was indivisible or of ambiguousvalue.Second, pirate constitutions prohibited activities that generated significantnegative externalities and threatened the success of criminal organizationaboard their ships. Thus pirate articles required crew members to keep theirweapons in good working order; on Roberts's ship, they limited drunkenraucousness to allow nonparticipant pirates to get sufficient sleep and to “givea Check to their Debauches” (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 211);prohibited on-board fighting that might jeopardize the entire crew's ability tofunction; and prohibited activities, such as gambling, that were likely to leadto on-board fights. On similar grounds, crews’ articles often prohibited women(and young boys), who it was thought would invite conflict or tension among crewmembers aboard their ships. “This being a good political Rule to preventdisturbances amongst them, it is strictly observed” (Snelgrave 1734[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos846914]: 256–257; seealso, Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 212).In the same way, some pirate ships forbade activities such as firing one's gunsor smoking in areas of the ship that carried highly flammable goods, such asgunpowder. According to the constitution that governed John Phillips's Revenge,for example, “That Man that shall snap his Arms, or smoak Tobacco in the Holdwithout a Cap to his Pipe, or carry a Candle lighted without a Lanthorn, shallsuffer the same Punishment as in the former Article” (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 342–343).Third, pirate constitutions contained articles that provided incentives forcrewmember productivity and prevented shirking. One manifestation of this wastheir creation of social insurance for pirates injured during battle. As in theearlier examples from Exquemelin and Roberts, articles specified in detail whata lost arm was worth, a lost leg, and so on. They even went as far as to assigndifferent insurance values depending on whether it was, for instance, the rightor left appendage that was mutilated or lost, according to the importancepirates assigned to these body parts.Another manifestation of these incentive provisions was the use of bonuses forcrew members who displayed particular courage in battle, were the first to spotpotential targets, and so on. Because pirate crews were large, quartermasterscouldn't easily monitor individual pirates’ effort. This is why pirates usedprofit sharing rather than fixed wages for payment.The problem with a share system is that it can create incentives for freeriding. Further, one team member's laziness directly reduces the income of theothers. To deal with this, pirates, like privateers and whalers, who also used ashare system, created bonuses. According to the rule aboard Exquemelin'sbuccaneering vessel, for instance, “Those who behaved courageously and performedany deed of extraordinary valour, or captured a ship, should be rewarded out ofthe common plunder” (Exquemelin 1678[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos811071]: 156). Or asJohnson (1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 191)records, “It must be observed, they [pirates] keep a good Look-out; for,according to their Articles, he who first espies a Sail, if she proves a Prize,is entitled the best Pair of Pistols on board, over and above his Dividend.”Finally, pirate articles stipulated punishments for failure to adhere to theirrules. As previously discussed, for more minor infractions, crews typicallydelegated punishment power to the ship's democratically elected quartermaster.As Johnson (1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 213)described it, the quartermaster “acts as a Sort of civil Magistrate on board aPyrate Ship.”35 In the case of more severe infractions, crew members voted onpunishments. In both cases pirate crews tended to follow the punishments forvarious infractions identified in their articles. By specifying punishments intheir articles, crews were able to limit the scope of quartermasters’ discretionin administering discipline, checking quartermasters’ power for abuse.Punishments for article violations varied from physical torture, such as“slitting the Ears and Nose of him that was Guilty,” to marooning – a practiceCaptain Johnson (1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 211)described as the “barbarous Custom of putting the Offender on Shore, on somedesolate or uninhabited Cape or Island, with a Gun, a few Shot, a Bottle ofWater, and a Bottle of Powder, to subsist with or starve.”36 On CaptainPhillips's ship, for example, article violations were punished with “Moses's Law(that is, 40 Stripes lacking one) on the bare back” (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 342–343).In this sense “Pirates exercised greater cruelty in maintaining discipline amongthemselves than in their treatment of prisoners” (Rankin 1969[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840062]: 37). Piratesconsidered theft aboard their ships especially heinous. Their articles reflectedthis and frequently punished theft with torture, marooning, or death. To helpkeep themselves honest, some crews used random searches to hunt for anyone whomight be holding back loot (Exquemelin 1678[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos811071]: 205–206).37 Toensure the quartermaster didn't hide booty from the crew, some piratesprohibited their valuable plunder from being kept under lock-and-key. As piratecaptive Peter Hooff described the situation on Captain Sam Bellamy's Whydah, forinstance, the “money was kept in Chests between Decks without any Guard, butnone was to take any without the Quarter Masters leave” (Rediker 2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840418]: 67; see alsoMarx 1996 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos831326]a: 44).Because pirate constitutions tended to be short and simple, they couldn't coverall possible contingencies that might affect a crew. In this sense they werealways incomplete. To deal with this, when a significant issue emerged, the crewgathered to act as a kind of judiciary to interpret or apply the ship's articlesto situations not clearly stipulated in the articles themselves (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 213): “InCase any Doubt should arise concerning the Construction of these Laws, and itshould remain a Dispute whether the Party had infringed them or no, a Jury wasappointed to explain them, and bring in a Verdict upon the Case in Doubt.”Through this “judicial review” process pirate crews were able to further limitquartermasters’ discretionary authority, restraining the potential forquartermaster abuse.The historical record points to the effectiveness of pirate constitutions inthis capacity, evidenced by the rarity of accounts of quartermaster abuse.Equally important, in the infrequent event that abuse did occur, the evidenceindicates that crews successfully removed abusive quartermasters from power. Forexample, in 1691 quartermaster Samuel Burgess cheated his crew in the divisionof food. In response his crew marooned him (Rogozinski 2000[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos842044]: 177).The evidence also suggests that piratical constitutions were successful inpreventing internal conflict and creating order aboard pirate ships. Pirates, itappears, strictly adhered to their articles. According to one historian, pirateswere more orderly, peaceful, and well organized among themselves than many ofthe colonies, merchant ships, or vessels of the Royal Navy (Rogozinski 2000[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos842044]). As oneastonished pirate observer put it, “At sea, they perform their duties with agreat deal of order, better even than on the Ships of the Dutch East IndiaCompany; the pirates take a great deal of pride in doing things right” (Bucquoy1744 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos801575]: 116).38 Or,as the editor of the 1699 edition of Exquemelin's pirate memoir describedbuccaneer society (Exquemelin 1699: Anonymous Editor's Preface), “it is veryremarkable, that in such a lawless Body as these Bucaniers seemed to be, inrespect to all others; that yet there should be such an Oeconomy (if I may sayso) kept and regularity practiced among themselves, so that every one seemed tohave his property as much secured, as if he had been a member of the mostCivilized Community in the World.”An eighteenth-century commentator was even more impressed with the effectivenessof pirate self-governance in this regard, but, in his astonishment, couldn'thelp but misconstrue their private system of self-governance as government.Their constitutions, he argued, “which kept Peace amongst one another, and underthe Title of Articles, has produced a System of Government, which I think,(considering what the Persons were who fram'd it) as excellent for Policy as anyThing in Plato's Commonwealth” (Weekly Journal May 23, 1724). While it seemsstrange to think about such order prevailing among pirates, the peculiarityfades when one recognizes that their organized criminal enterprise's successdepended on it.And succeed many pirates did. Although there aren't data that would allow me tocompute anything like the average pirate's wage, what evidence is availablesuggests that incredibly large pirate prizes weren't unheard of. Of course, thisevidence must be interpreted with caution. These seizures were recordedprecisely because of their spectacular size. More common were undoubtedly moremodest prizes. Nevertheless, the examples we have are enough to point to thesignificant success of piratical plunder in some cases and the opportunitypiracy offered sailors for becoming incredibly wealthy.“At a time when Anglo-American seamen on a trading voyage to Madagascar werecollecting less than twelve pounds sterling a year…the deep-water pirates couldrealize a hundred or even a thousand times more” (Marx 1996[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos831326]c: 141). In 1695,for example, Henry Every's pirate fleet captured a prize carrying more than£600,000 in precious metals and jewels. The resulting shareout earned eachmember of his crew £1,000, the equivalent of nearly forty years’ income for anable merchant seaman at the time (Konstam 2007[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos823930]: 98). In theearly eighteenth century Captain John Bowen's pirate crew plundered a prize“which yielded them 500 l. per Man.” Several years later Captain Thomas White'screw retired to Madagascar after a marauding expedition, each pirate havingearned £1,200 from the cruise (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 480, 485).In 1720 Captain Christopher Condent's crew seized a prize that earned eachpirate £3,000. Similarly, in 1721 Captain John Taylor and Oliver La Bouche'spirate consort earned an astonishing £4,000 for each crew member from a singleattack (Marx 1996[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos831326]c: 161, 163). Eventhe small pirate crew captained by John Evans in 1722 took enough booty to split“nine thousand Pounds among thirty Persons” – or £300 a pirate – in less thansix months “on the account” (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 340). Toput these earnings in perspective, compare them to the average able merchantseaman's wage over the same period. Between 1689 and 1740 this varied from 25 to55 shillings per month – a meager £15–£33 per year (Davis 1962[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos807997]: 136–137).Absent data for a larger number of pirate hauls, it's impossible to say whetherthe average seventeenth- or eighteenth-century pirate consistently earned morethan the average seventeenth- or eighteenth-century merchant sailor. It'scertainly possible that this was the case, however. As one pirate testified athis trial, for instance, “it is a common thing for us [pirates] when at Sea toacquire vast quantities, both of the Metal that goes before me [silver,referring to the silver oar of the Admiralty court], and of Gold” (Hayward 1735[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos818163]: vol. 1, 45).This pirate's remark may reflect his desire to impress the court more than itreflects piracy's profitability. Still, what the evidence on pirate booty doesclearly point to is the tremendous potential upside of piratical employment.Unlike employment as a merchant sailor, which guaranteed a low, if more regular,income, a single successful pirating expedition could make a sailor wealthyenough to retire. This is no doubt largely the reason why, as oneeighteenth-century colonial governor remarked, “so many are willing to joyn them[pirates] when taken” (Colonial Office Papers May 31, 1718: f. 18).39The financial rewards of securing successful self-governance motivated piratesto do just that despite the difficulty of doing so in their societies composedexclusively of bad apples. The remark of one perceptive eighteenth-centuryobserver indicates precisely this. As he put it, “great robbers as they are toall besides, [pirates] are precisely just among themselves; without which theycould no more Subsist than a Structure without a Foundation” (Slush 1709[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos845916]: viii).40“[K]ings were not needed to invent the pirate system of governance” (Rogozinski2000 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos842044]: 184). And,as the next essay discusses, they aren't needed to invent systems ofself-governance in other outlaw societies either. Captain Charles Johnson (1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 114)described pirates’ criminal organization as “that abominable Society.” Howeverabominable, because of pirates’ self-governing system, it was a societynonetheless.* This chapter is based on and uses material from Leeson, Peter T. 2007.“An-arrgh-chy: The Law and Economics of Pirate Organization.” Journal ofPolitical Economy 115(6): 1049–1094 [© 2007 The University of Chicago]. 1 “Captain Johnson” is a pen name used by the author of A General History ofthe Pyrates. His true identity remains unknown. In 1932 John R. Moore claimedthat Johnson was in fact Daniel Defoe. However, in the late 1980s this view wasoverturned (see Furbank and Owens 1988[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813180]), and today manypirate historians reject the view that Defoe is the author of this importantbook (see, for instance, Cordingly 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos805455]; Rediker 2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840418]; Woodard 2007[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos856525]; for the opposingview, see Rogozinski 2000[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos842044]). WhateverJohnson's true identity, it's agreed that he “had extensive first-hand knowledgeof piracy” (Konstam 2007[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos823930]: 12). While it'swidely acknowledged that Johnson's work contains some errors and apocryphalaccounts (such as the community of Libertalia), “Johnson is widely regarded as ahighly reliable source for factual information” on pirates (Rediker 2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840418]: 180) and remainsa definitive source that historians rely on in constructing their accounts ofseventeenth and eighteenth-century piracy. As eminent pirate historian DavidCordingly (2006 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos805455]:xx) puts it, this book “is the prime source for the lives of many pirates ofwhat is often called the Golden Age of Piracy.” 2 Jameson (1923 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821178])has edited an excellent collection of such records. Unless otherwise noted, alldepositions and examinations quoted in this chapter are from his collection. 3 Importantly, drawing on the historical episode of pirates helps overcome theproblem of “getting inside” criminal organizations, whose criminality oftenprecludes inside views. Records from individuals who had direct experiences withpirates, as well as those that shed light on piratical governance mechanismsfrom pirates themselves, allow me to view pirates’ criminal organization “fromthe inside.” 4 Additionally, this essay relies on and is greatly indebted to a voluminousmodern literature covering all aspects of piracy, including those consideredhere, written by contemporary historians. Some of the best discussions belong toRediker (1981 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840203],2006 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840580]), Cordingly(1996 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos805259], 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos805455]), Gosse (1946[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos815536]), Rankin (1969[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840062]), Pringle (1953[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos839242]), Konstam (2002[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos823801]), and Rogozinski(2000 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos842044]). 5 The “nest of rogues” terminology in this section's heading comes fromGovernor William Spotswood who, in a letter to the British Lords of theAdmiralty, complained of the growing pirate problem in New Providence (Spotswood1882 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos847384]: vol. 2,168). 6 The dates historians give to mark the Golden Age of Piracy vary. Cordingly(2006 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos805455]) provides aslightly larger range, from about 1650 to 1725. Still others, such as Rankin(1969 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840062]), date thegreat age of piracy as encompassing the years between 1630 and 1720. The furtherback in this range one goes, the more one is dealing with buccaneers, as opposedto pure pirates. 7 Pirates also exhibited some diversity in social standing. Although mostpirates were uneducated and from the lower classes of society, a few were welleducated and came from higher stations in life. 8 Pure pirates should be distinguished from buccaneers, privateers, andcorsairs. Pure pirates were total outlaws and attacked merchant shipsindiscriminately for their own gain. Privateers and corsairs, in contrast, wereboth state-sanctioned sea robbers. Governments licensed the former to attackenemy ships in times of war. Governments licensed the latter to attack the shipsof other nations on the basis of religion. “Buccaneering was a peculiar blend ofpiracy and privateering in which the two elements were often indistinguishable”(Marx 1996 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos831326]a: 38).Often times, buccaneers plundered with official sanction, making them more likeprivateers than pirates. Many other times, however, they didn't. In these casesthey were acting as pure pirates. 9 These numbers are especially large when one puts them in historicalperspective. The Royal Navy, for example, employed only 13,000 men in any oneyear between 1716 and 1726, making the pirate population in a good year morethan 15 percent of the Navy population (Rediker 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840580]: 256). In 1680the total population of the American colonies was less than 152,000 (Hughes andCain 1994 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos819923]: 20).In fact, as late as 1790, when the first U.S. census was taken, only 24 placesin the country had populations greater than 2,500 (Hughes and Cain 1994[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos819923]: 28). 10 Quoted in Cordingly (2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos805455]: 165–166). 11 In the South China Sea, Cheng I commanded a pirate confederacy that may haveboasted an astonishing 150,000 members (Konstam 2002[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos823801]: 174). Chinesepirates sometimes sailed together in fleets of 500 ships or more. 12 Navy ships were also organized autocratically. Their captains werecommissioned by the Admiralty (typically on the recommendation of superiorcommissioned officers) and had command over crew activities, power to physicallypunish sailors (or to direct/authorize lower-ranking officers to do so), and soforth. Captains of larger naval ships didn't, however, have control overvictuals, which were instead controlled by a warrant officer called the“purser.” The purser's logs, which documented victuals distributed, were oftenapproved by the captain. 13 Ownership groups were sizeable because of the need to diversify the risk ofmerchant shipping. Each merchant purchased a small share in many ships ratherthan being the sole owner of one. 14 Because most merchant ships were owned by groups of investors, even in caseswhen a merchant captained his vessel himself, there remained absentee owners:his co-investors. 15 Absentee ownership was further assured by the fact that the members ofmerchant vessel ownership groups engaged in many commercial activities besidetheir concern in a particular merchant ship. These other commercial activitiesoften required merchants to be on land to tend to their affairs rather than atsea. 16 Although merchant ships engaged in coastal trade were at sea for shorterperiods, merchant ships engaged in long-distance trade could be gone for periodsof nine months or more. 17 In addition to using autocratic captains to cope with this principal-agentproblem, merchant ships also held back a portion (or sometimes all) of sailors’wages until a voyage was complete. 18 A few merchant ships engaged in part-time fishing used a share system ofpayment similar to the one privateers, whalers, and pirates used. Theoverwhelming majority of merchant ships used a fixed-wage system. In vesselsengaged in coastal shipping, sailors were paid lump-sum wages. In vesselsengaged in long-distance shipping, sailors were paid monthly wages. 19 The owner-sailor principal-agent problem couldn't have been overcome byconverting every crew member's fixed wage to a profit-sharing scheme. Even underprofit sharing, sailors would still have an incentive to consume cargo, liberalprovisions, and so on and then blame the loss on the uncertainties of the sea,such as pirates or wreck. Although this opportunism would reduce each sailor'sshare of the voyage's net proceeds, because the cost of such behavior is bornepartially by the absentee owners, sailors have an incentive to actopportunistically. Further, converting sailor wages to shares wouldn't havedeterred the crew from the most costly kind of opportunism – absconding with theship and its freight. Because the benefit of such theft would exceed the crew'sfraction of a successful voyage's proceeds, which are shared with the absenteeowners under a profit-sharing scheme, absent an authority to monitor and controltheir behavior, crews would still have an incentive to steal the ships on whichthey sailed. This is why both privateers and whaling ships, for instance, whichused a pirate-like profit-sharing system, but also had absentee owners, stillrequired and used autocratic captains. On the efficiency of the fixed-wagesystem for the merchant marine and efficiency of the share system for privateersand whalers, which also applies to pirates, see Gifford (1993[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos814857]). 20 A third device owners used for this purpose, though of declining importanceover time, was that of the supercargo – an agent hired by the ship's owners whosailed on the ship and managed commercial aspects of the voyage, such as buyingand selling cargo at port, and sometimes deciding what ports the ship shouldstop at, when the captain could not be trusted in these capacities (Davis 1962[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos807997]). 21 Quoted in Rediker (2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840580]: 208). 22 Quoted in Rediker (2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840580]: 247). 23 Quoted in Rediker (2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840580]: 216). 24 This quotation is from a late-eighteenth-century sailor, but captures thesituation in the earlier part of the century as well. 25 However, there is one eighteenth-century pirate, Stede Bonnet, who actuallypurchased the first ship with which he went on the account. 26 Of course even pirates’ democratic system of checks and balances couldn'tprevent all instances of captain predation. Because he controlled battle-relateddecisions, a pirate captain could, for instance, still put a crew member hedisliked in harm's way. 27 In some cases crews also physically punished their captains for behaviorsthey deemed inconsistent with their interests. Oliver La Bouche, for example,was deprived of his captain position and flogged for attempting to desert hiscrew (Bucquoy 1744[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos801575]: 103, translatedand quoted in Rogozinski 2000[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos842044]: 177).Occasionally, crews also deserted predatory captains (Council of the LeewardIslands May 18, 1699, Public Record Office, Colonial Office Papers, 152: 3, no.21). 28 This competition likely explains the rarity of cases ofcaptain-quartermaster collusion against crews. 29 Quoted in Rogozinski (2000[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos842044]: 175). 30 This decentralization of authority and elimination of captain privilegeaboard pirate ships was a radical departure from conditions in the legitimatemaritime world. Observers were therefore shocked at the incredible absence ofhierarchy aboard pirate ships. Commenting on their democratic form ofgovernance, for example, the Dutch governor of Mauritius marveled, “Every manhad as much say as the captain” (Ritchie 1986[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos841657]: 124). 31 The captain referred to here is William Kidd, a privateer-turned-pirate, whowas ultimately executed for his crimes. Notably, Kidd's privateer ship wasfinanced by absentee, landed-merchant owners. 32 Many individuals ostensibly forced to join pirate crews in fact joinedvoluntarily. Officially, they asked to be “forced” and occasionally put up ashow to their comrades to this effect so that in the event their pirate crew wasever captured, they could claim that they were compelled as a defense (Pringle1953 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos839242]; see also,Rankin 1969 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840062];Leeson 2010 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos825555]c). 33 A letter from colonial Governor Alexander Spotswood to the Board of Tradehighlights the effectiveness of pirates’ information-sharing network. Spotswood,who having “been markt as the principle object of their vengeance, for cuttingoff their arch pirate Thatch [a.k.a. Blackbeard]” complained of finding a placeto escape to “where neither Master nor Sailors know me, & so may possibly escapethe knowledge of ye pirates” (Colonial Office Papers June 16, 1724, 5/1319: ff.190–192, quoted in Rediker 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840580]: 254, 134). 34 Some pirate ships required crew members to agree to stay on until a certainsum was earned or an expedition completed. However, if a ship became too crowdedor some other compelling reason came along for a crew to split, it did so. Inthis case new articles were drawn up and pirates had the option to sign on withthe new crew or stay with the old. There don't appear to be any cases of pirateconstitutions being altered or amended mid-cruise. The status of forced men onpirate ships seems to have varied. A few appear to have been compelled to signthe ship's articles. Others weren't compelled to do so but didn't have a vote inthe company's affairs until they signed (Rediker 2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840418]: 79–81). 35 Thus, the quartermaster also refereed duels between conflicting parties,which would take place on land so as not to destroy the ship (Johnson 1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728: 212; seealso, 339): “The Quarter-Master of the Ship, when the Parties will not come toany Reconciliation, accompanies them on Shore with what Assistance he thinksproper, and turns the Disputants Back to Back, at so many paces Distance: At theWord of Command, they turn and fire immediately.…If both miss, they come totheir Cutlashes, and then he is declared Victor who draws the first blood.” 36 Marooning was frequently coupled with ostracism in the event that thetransgressor managed to survive. See, for instance, Exquemelin (1678[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos811071]: 72). 37 Oath taking was also commonly used among pirates as a method of stakingone's reputation to help enforce piratical articles and custom. See, forinstance, Exquemelin (1678[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos811071]: 68, 71–72, 100,104, 156, 161). 38 Translated and quoted in Rogozinski (2000[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos842044]: viii). 39 Quoted in Rediker (2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840580]: 260). 40 Quoted in Rediker (2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840580]: 287)."},{"pageContent":"7 Criminal Constitutions*Caribbean pirates aren't the only society of bad apples that relied onconstitutions to produce successful self-governance. Many outlaw societies doso. Twenty-two of the thirty-seven street gangs Jankowski (1991[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821348]: 78–82) studiedhave written constitutions. Sicilian Mafiosi follow a largely unwritten code ofrules, and recently police found a written set of “ten commandments” outliningthe Mafia's core laws (Gambetta 1993[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813347]; Lubrano 2007[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos830372]). Kaminski (2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos822176]) identifiesextensive (yet unwritten) rules dictating nearly every aspect of incarceratedPolish prisoners’ lives, from what words are acceptable to use in greeting astranger to how and when to use the bathroom. And the National Gang CrimeResearch Center considers constitutions so central to criminal societies thatthe use of a constitution is one of the defining characteristics it uses whenclassifying gangs (Knox 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos823318]: 22–25).This essay develops a framework for thinking about the prevalence ofconstitutional self-governance in criminal societies rooted in the idea ofprofit-maximizing outlaws.1 Unlike most legitimate societies, criminal ones,such as pirates’, are also organizations – groups of people who come togetherseeking cooperation for a narrow purpose. Firms are organizations that haveprofit as that purpose and, ultimately, criminal organizations have this astheir purpose too. In contrast to legitimate firms, however, criminal ones mustproduce social order to maximize profit. Hewlett-Packard doesn't need aconstitutional rule that prohibits murder, nor does the Kiwanis Club. Instead,these organizations’ members rely on the government's rules that prohibitmurder. In contrast, criminals have no rules of social order unless theirorganizations create them. It's in this sense that criminal organizations aremore than ordinary firms and, in fact, more than ordinary organizations moregenerally: they're also societies. The key to understanding how criminalorganizations use constitutions to maximize profit therefore lies inunderstanding how they use constitutions to produce organizational cooperationin this broad and most basic sense.2 To illustrate how they do so, I examine theconstitutional self-governance of a contemporary Californian prison gang: LaNuestra Familia.A Framework for Understanding Criminal ConstitutionsConstitutions perform three functions that help criminal organizations createcooperation. First, they create consensus by generating common knowledge aboutthe organization's rules. If the criminals who compose an organization havedifferent ideas and expectations about what members’ rights and duties consistof, how the organization does or should work, or what the organization's goalsare, conflict is likely and criminals will often work at cross-purposes. Incontrast, common knowledge exists when all members of an organization know therules, everyone knows that everyone knows the rules, and everyone knows thateveryone knows that everyone knows the rules, ad infinitum.Constitutions create common knowledge by making the organization's rulesexplicit. They enumerate the most critical expectations of members’ behavior,such as how members join, the rules of organizational decision making, the rulesof commitment, the rights of membership, and restrictions on members’ behavior.3Common knowledge about the organization's rules creates common expectationsamong the organization's members. Whether they're written or unwritten, becausethey're constitutional rules, the organization requires that all members beintroduced to these rules and familiar with their essential components. Theorganization introduces potential members to constitutional rules so thatpotential members have an understanding of what the rules entail when makingtheir decision about joining. Common expectations promote intraorganizationalconsensus by putting all of the organization's members “on the same page” withrespect to duties, privileges, and obligations of their and others’ membership.In achieving this, constitutions greatly reduce the potential forintraorganizational conflicts and facilitate the enforcement of constitutionalprovisions.Criminal constitutions also promote consensus by creating entrance requirementsfor would-be members. If each would-be member must acknowledge and agree to theorganization's constitutional rules before they can join, every other member ofthe organization can have greater confidence that the would-be member'sintentions comport with their own. Requiring ex ante agreement to constitutionalrules serves to sort would-be organization members into those who agree to bebound by the organization's constitutional rules, and thus are permittedmembership, and those who refuse to be bound by these rules, and thus are deniedmembership. The organization therefore consists only of criminals who agree tobe bound by the same set of rules that other members have agreed to be bound by.Having all of a criminal organization's members’ expectations aligned isparticularly important for outlaws precisely because they're outlaws. Thepossibility of a disgruntled organization member providing law enforcement withsensitive information poses a serious threat to the organization's existence andprofitability. In contrast, legitimate organizations don't typically fear adismissed employee, even when disgruntled, because they're not engaged inillegal activity. Furthermore, state-enforced contracts, such as nondisclosureagreements, effectively protect legitimate organizations’ sensitive information.Thus, while having the same high level of constitutional commitment acrossmembers is critically important for criminal organizations, it's less importantfor legitimate ones.Second, criminal constitutions regulate individual behaviors that are privatelybeneficial but harmful to the organization. In legitimate organizationsindividuals have opportunities to engage in behaviors that improve their ownsituation but adversely affect others in the organization. This is also true incriminal organizations. For instance, the leaders of a criminal organization mayuse their positions of authority to prey on lower-ranking members. Iflower-ranking members must devote resources to avoiding their superiors’predation, organizational productivity declines. Unless the organization'sleader is the sole residual claimant on the organization's profits (in whichcase he fully capitalizes the productivity losses of his predation), he may havean incentive to engage in predation.Alternatively, lower-ranking organization members may be tempted to engage inactivities that undermine their colleagues’ welfare. For example, a drug-sellinggang may have an agreement with a neighboring gang not to sell drugs in thelatter's territory. This agreement is beneficial for both gangs as a wholebecause it prevents a costly war. However, an individual gang member of theformer group can benefit by “chiseling” and selling drugs in the other gang'sterritory against the agreement. If his chiseling goes undetected, this gangmember will enjoy profits that his fellow gang members (and the members of theother gang) don't. But if the other gang detects him, the chiseler's behaviormay lead to a war against his gang, which will harm the chiseler, but only by afraction of the total harm his gang incurs.Other behaviors in which members of criminal organizations may engage can alsogenerate significant negative spillovers for their colleagues. Consider, forexample, “communication cheating.” Because they wish to avoid arrest andincarceration, criminal organizations often create rules restricting the mannerand timing of intraorganizational communication. For example, prison gangmembers develop elaborate codes and ciphers, learn obscure languages, such asthe Aztec language Nahuatl, hide messages in artwork, and even write letters inurine, which correctional officers are less likely to see, but which can berevealed by a knowing recipient.4Communication restrictions are very important for the overall criminalorganization but are costly for individual organization members to follow. It'sdifficult and unpleasant to write and decode secret messages written in urine.An individual gang member may desire to avoid these costly communicationtechniques but, by doing so, risks providing evidence that can incriminatemembers of the entire organization. This is especially so in the United Stateswhere the Pinkerton Doctrine makes each co-conspirator in a criminal enterpriseresponsible for reasonably foreseeable crimes committed by all other members ofthe organization (Pinkerton v. United States 328 U.S. 640 1946). Each member'sability to commit crimes covertly therefore significantly affects others’livelihoods. Constitutional rules that deter such behaviors prevent privatelybeneficial but organizationally costly behaviors that threaten to undermineorganization members’ ability to cooperate. In this way constitutions helpcriminals cope with divergences between intraorganizational private and socialcosts that would otherwise threaten criminals’ ability to work together forprofit.Third, criminal constitutions generate information about member misconduct andcoordinate the enforcement of the organization's rules. In the absence ofexplicit rules defining acceptable behavior, it can be hard for members to knowwhether one of their colleagues’ questionable behaviors is legitimate or not.Further, if one member observes misconduct, he may be unlikely to intercede tostop it. If he alone challenges his comrade's behavior, he may be subject toreprisals. Even if an organization member is willing to risk challenging andattempting to discipline another member, he may find it hard to do sosuccessfully if effective discipline, such as multilateral punishment, must bejointly produced.Criminal constitutions help overcome these obstacles to rule enforcement.Because constitutions explicitly define acceptable behavior and stipulatepenalties for violating such behavior, they make rule violations easier todetect and coordinate members’ response to these violations. Constitutionsclarify ambiguities about when misconduct has occurred and about how members aresupposed to react to such behavior. Additionally, by creating commonexpectations among all organization members about how to handle misconduct,constitutions assist the enforcement of their terms by improving the probabilitythat multiple members will challenge prohibited behavior by another member. Inthis way constitutions also make jointly produced punishments possible.Criminal constitutions vary considerably in their length, level of detail, andfocus. Some organizations emphasize one of the three functions discussedearlier, while other organizations emphasize others. These differences reflectparticular criminal organizations’ specific needs. For example, given thedifferent criminal activities in which Caribbean pirates and California prisongangs are engaged, and the different contexts in which they operate, thesecriminal organizations have rather different criminal constitutions. Despitethese variations in emphasis, both organizations’ constitutions perform allthree functions I have described.Chapter 7 considered the constitutions of Caribbean pirates. Here I consider theconstitution of a Californian prison gang. However, in doing so, it's useful torecall the features of pirates’ constitutions. To facilitate a comparison of thesimilarities and differences between the particular ways in which each criminalorganization's constitution performs the functions discussed above, the appendixto this essay contains each organization's constitution in full. In thatappendix I code each element of both criminal organizations’ constitutionscomprehensively to correspond to the three functions of criminal constitutionselaborated earlier.A Constitution for ConvictsLa Nuestra Familia (Spanish for “Our Family”) prison gang controls NorthernCalifornia prison cellblocks and neighborhoods. In addition to narcoticsdistribution, it earns profits through robbery, murder for hire, and variousother criminal exploits (Federal Bureau of Investigation 2008[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos811678]; CaliforniaDepartment of Justice 2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos802117]).Hispanic inmates established the gang in the 1960s. To do so the gang's founderswrote “The Supreme Power Structure of La Nuestra Familia,” a lengthyconstitution that details the structure and operational protocols of La NuestraFamilia's criminal organization.5 The nuestro general, to whom the constitutiongranted “absolute authority,” initially led the organization. He supervised tencaptains, each of whom resided in a different correctional facility. Each ofthese captains in turn directed regiments consisting of lieutenants andsoldiers.La Nuestra Familia (NF) confronts substantial organizational difficulties. Lawenforcement officials estimate its membership between 400 and 600 incarceratedmembers. Additionally, though not official NF members, approximately 1,000“associates” regularly work for the gang (Lewis 1980[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos827904]: 133; Fuentes2006 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813023]: 297).Unlike the members of a Caribbean pirate outfit, who sailed together in onecrew, the NF's members are scattered throughout the California prison system andNorthern California neighborhoods. Running the equivalent of a large businesswithout government, under the constraints of incarceration, and with membersdispersed across a large geographic area seems virtually impossible. Yet theNF's constitution successfully facilitates this criminal organization'soperations by creating consensus, constraining organizationally harmfulbehavior, and generating information about misconduct.The NF constitution creates consensus by clarifying members’ expectationsthrough making organizational duties explicit. According to the constitution,“It is the sacred duty of a familianos guerrero [warrior] to do battle for LaNuestra Familia, and no soldado should feel that because he fought for his Othat he is entitled to special privileges. All that matters is that you as aguerrero of La Nuestra Familia are living up to your responsibilities.” Theconstitution also requires that “No member of this O shall put material things,whether it be drugs, money, women, or punks (as related to the pinta) before thebest interest of La Nuestra Familia or a familianos,” and that “[n]o familianoshall lie about his position in La Nuestra Familia nor when discussingfamilianos business to a superior or a brother member” (Fuentes 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813023]: 10). Further,the NF constitution requires all gang members to swear to work “for thebetterment of its members and the building up of this O on the outside into astrong and self-supporting familia” and to “work solely for this objective andwill put all personal goals and feelings aside” (Fuentes 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813023]: 5).Like Caribbean pirates who used agreement to their constitutions to filterorganizational membership by requiring all members to explicitly agree to theorganization's rules ex ante, the NF constitution creates consensus by ensuringthat every person who joins the NF explicitly acknowledges familiarity with theconstitution and agrees to its provisions. According to the NF constitution,“All present familianos in said O La Nuestra Familia acknowledges saidconstitution upon reading it and will be held accountable for his actions ifsaid constitution is not followed” (Fuentes 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813023]: 6). Notably, allorganization members swear allegiance to the constitution rather than to aparticular gang leader.The NF constitution also creates consensus by enshrining the organization'spolicy of “blood in, blood out,” which requires that “[a] Familiano will remaina member until death or otherwise discharged from the O” (Fuentes 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813023]: 5). Because ofthis provision, gang members know that to exit the organization they must paythe ultimate price. This rule gives gang members a strong incentive to createconsensus and cooperation within the organization. Mandatory lifetime membershipalso lowers the uncertainty associated with frequently changing organizationmembers. Given the high constitutionally created barriers to entering andexiting the organization, radical changes in its composition, which mightdisturb organizational consensus, are less likely.The NF constitution prevents organization members from engaging in privatelybeneficial but organizationally harmful activities by creating rules thatprohibit them. In the NF the most important such behavior that must be preventedis gang leader self-dealing. The NF's hierarchical structure permits theorganization to reduce decision-making costs for many issues that would be verycostly or in some cases impossible to decide if the entire organization had toconsult. However, a hierarchical structure also empowers leaders with authoritythey may be tempted to abuse for personal benefit.For example, because exit is very costly, the general may have an incentive toabuse his power and mistreat his underlings. To prevent this, the NFconstitution gives captains the right to impeach the general for misconduct.According to the constitution, the “NG may be impeached from office where it isthe opinion of all commanders holding office at that time that he isn't workingin the best interest of the organization” (Fuentes 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813023]: 5). In 1978 NFmembers learned the then-general was embezzling tens of thousands of dollarsfrom the organization's treasury. According to a former high-ranking member, thegeneral denied “any wrong doing and refused to relinquish any financial records.Believing that something should be done, NF members charged [the general] withmisappropriating NF funds and impeached him.” When the general refused torelinquish his post and return the funds, the organization invoked theconstitutionally prescribed punishment for such a crime: death (Fuentes 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813023]: 28).Surprisingly, the general lived through the organization's attack on his life.But the NF expelled him from the gang and he remained on the organization's hitlist.6 Because the general was embezzling resources to which the captains had apartial claim, it was in their interest to initiate the constitutionallyspecified process of enforcement to put a stop to it. However, if eachindividual captain had been unsure about the rules or his authority to censure ahigher-ranking member, this predatory behavior may have continued.Constitutional rules provided common knowledge about what constituted aviolation, so members were able to coordinate enforcement throughconstitutionally established mechanisms.NF captains, who control their own regiments, may be similarly tempted to abusetheir authority for personal gain at the organization's expense. The variety ofpotential abuses is large and ranges from stealing from underlings to shirkingorganizational duties. To prevent such behavior, the NF constitution empowersthe general “to discharge any commander that is negligent in the functions ofhis position” (Fuentes 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813023]: 4). Because thegeneral is a partial residual claimant on the revenues created by the NF'sactivities, it's in his interest to enforce such punishments providing thatdoing so is not prohibitively costly. By clarifying his demotion of thenegligent captain as a legitimate act of rule enforcement, as opposed to anabuse of his authority, to the gang's other members and coordinating thesemembers’ support of this act, the NF constitution reduces the general's cost ofenforcing such punishments to make this possible. For instance, the NFleadership demoted one captain outside of prison for being lax in his operationsand failing to properly enforce the NF's order within his regiment in favor of acaptain who would do so (Reynolds 2008[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos841287]).The NF constitution creates information about when organizational misconductoccurs and coordinates organization members’ response to such behavior bycreating an official complaint process that members may use to inform theorganization about colleagues’ misconduct. Such misconduct includes mistreatmentand mismanagement by their superiors who are, for example, running theirregiment inefficiently. According to the NF constitution, “if a familianossoldado feels that the power or powers of the structure in his regiment ismisusing their appointed authority against him due to conflicting personalities,he has the right as an honorable member of this O to appeal to the supremecommander” (Fuentes 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813023]: 8). During timesof peace, soldiers may complain to captains or the general if lieutenantsviolate constitutional rules or unfairly demote members. Lieutenants may appealto the general if they have grievances against the captain of their regiment orif he is derelict in his duties. Given that soldiers suffer directly if theirlieutenants mistreat them, and lieutenants suffer directly if their captainsmistreat them, both groups have an incentive to appeal to such mechanisms toenforce the organization's rules against misbehaving superiors and theconstitution's coordinating effect makes doing so sufficiently inexpensive.When organization members file grievances, the constitution requires that “uponreceiving a complaint from one of his soldados…[the Nuestro General] willappoint a committee of no less than three soldados from that particular clan toinvestigate said charges, and each is to report to the NG” (Fuentes 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813023]: 4).7 Thisinformation-generating process is important for three reasons. First, itprovides an orderly and peaceable mechanism for investigating and resolvingdisagreements between organization members. Second, by involving multiplemembers of the organization, this process helps generate common knowledge aboutsuspected rule violations and, if these suspicions turn out to be supported,helps generate common knowledge that a rule violation has occurred and requirespunishment, facilitating the enforcement of constitutionally specified rules.8Finally, by making the procedure for addressing potential rule violationsexplicit, the NF constitution coordinates organization members on how to respondto rule violations and ensures that there will in fact be a response. Potentialrule violations in such a large organization are liable to slip through thecracks, especially if members who observe them are unsure about if or how toaddress them. The NF's constitution attenuates this problem by creating anexplicit means of addressing potential rule violations, which createsinformation about such violations and helps ensure that members follow therules.It would be a mistake to think that criminals always strictly follow theirorganizations’ constitutions. Like legitimate political officers operating underlegitimate constitutions, criminals may violate or ignore their constitutions.Similarly, like those officers, criminals may come to interpret theirconstitutions in ways that are at odds with their “original intent.” Even whenthey're followed, criminal constitutions’ helpfulness in promoting social orderand cooperation within criminal organizations is imperfect. Criminalconstitutions weren't able to eliminate all conflict among Caribbean piratecrews, and neither are they able to do so in the NF. Still, as I discuss later,existing evidence on which criminal organizations use constitutions supports theidea that criminal constitutions are effective much of the time, which explainswhy many outlaw organizations use them.In light of the benefits my discussion suggests constitutions create forcriminal organizations, why doesn't every criminal organization rely on aconstitution? My framework for understanding criminal constitutions’ prevalencesuggests that criminal organizations adopt constitutions because they producesocial order by promoting organizational consensus, regulating externalitygenerating behaviors, and helping enforce organizational rules, which in turnenhances profits. But constitutions aren't the only way to achieve these goals.For example, families often secure a high degree of internal consensus, restrictprivately beneficial activities that could be destructive to the whole, andenforce rules without the aid of written constitutions. They rely on theirmembers’ extremely small numbers, close proximity, and social closeness tofacilitate these ends instead. Even if families didn't benefit from the broadsocial order that government provides, these features would largely preclude thekind of social dilemma that persons face when they're part of largerpopulations, located more remotely from one another, and aren't closely relatedby blood or otherwise, and thus preclude the kind of problem situation in whichconstitutions might provide significant benefits.Criminal organizations that share family-type features can also achieve theseends without constitutions. Those that are small, have highly homogeneousmembership, and reside in close proximity to one another will benefit less fromcreating constitutions. Because of their particular features, such organizationsenjoy “natural” consensus, find it cheaper to identify organizationally harmfulbehavior, and find it easier to coordinate an effective response to suchbehavior.Because, like creating any contract, creating a constitution is costly, thelower benefit of constitutions to small, homogeneous criminal organizationsmakes such organizations less likely to adopt constitutions than large criminalorganizations whose members are scattered and don't have strongextra-organizational ties. This suggests that some criminal organizations withthese characteristics will find creating a constitution unprofitable and sowon't have one. And the evidence is consistent with this suggestion. Knox (2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos823318]: 22–25), forexample, notes that the use of criminal constitutions is associated with largergroup size and more complicated operations. Similarly, Jankowski (1991[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821348]: 82) finds thatsmaller street gangs that engage in simple criminal activities are less likelyto rely on constitutions than larger, more sophisticated gangs are.In supporting the idea that criminal organizations only adopt constitutions whenthey anticipate net benefits from doing so, this evidence also supports the ideathat criminal constitutions are often effective. If they weren't, constitutionswould typically pose net costs to criminal organizations that adopted them,making it puzzling why any criminal organization would choose to adopt them, letalone why many criminal organizations choose to.Just as some criminal organizations don't find it profitable to createconstitutions at all, my discussion highlights that among the criminalorganizations that do find it profitable to create constitutions, points ofconstitutional emphasis will differ across those organizations. This reflectsdifferent criminal organizations’ specific contexts and thus needs. For example,compared to the NF, eighteenth-century Caribbean pirates found it easier todetect rule violations because their organizations were much smaller and theirorganizations’ members were in much closer proximity to one another.9 Piratescould obtain information about rule infractions more easily than NF members can.The need to create information about rule violations through constitutions inpirates’ organization was therefore less urgent than in the NF. Consequently,pirate constitutions emphasized consensus building and the coordination ofdiverse individuals more than they emphasized generating information aboutmisconduct. In contrast, NF members are almost all Californian Hispanics.Because of this, consensus is easier to attain in this criminal organizationthan it was among pirates. However, because the NF is very large and itsmembership is dispersed, it faces significantly higher costs of generatinginformation about rule violations. The NF's constitution therefore focuses moreon mechanisms that facilitate the discovery of misconduct.Despite these important differences in constitutional specifics, all criminalorganizations that use constitutions do so for the same basic purpose: tofacilitate social cooperation in the face of information costs, coordinationproblems, and externalities that threaten such cooperation without governmentand thus criminals’ ability to maximize profit. Through those constitutions,criminal organizations are able to secure successful self-governance despite thefact that the societies they reflect are populated exclusively by bad apples.AppendixThis appendix reproduces the constitutions of Captain Bartholomew Robert'spirate crew and La Nuestra Familia prison gang. The former is contained in theeighteenth-century pirate chronicler Captain Charles Johnson's (1726[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821708]–1728) book, AGeneral History of the Pyrates. The latter is contained in Nina Fuentes's (2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813023]) The Rise andFall of the Nuestra Familia.I have coded each component of these constitutions (in parenthesis) to identifyits function in terms of the theory of criminal constitutions presented earlier.Code (1) indicates that a provision relates to the common knowledge function ofcriminal constitutions. Code (2) indicates that a provision limits behaviorwithin organizations that may be individually beneficial but harmful to theorganization. Code (3) indicates that a provision provides information aboutmisconduct and/or mechanisms for enforcement. A constitutional provision canperform multiple purposes, so many of the provisions have been coded formultiple functions.The Constitution of Captain Bartholomew Roberts's Pirate Crew> > > I Every Man has a Vote in the Affairs of Moment; has equal Title to the> > > fresh Provisions, or strong Liquors, at any Time seized, and may use them> > > at Pleasure, unless a Scarcity make it necessary, for the Good of all, to> > > vote a Retrenchment.

See alsoAnderson (1979 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos792654]);Reuter (1985 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos841129]);Jennings (1984 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos821537]);Arlacchi (1988 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos794029]);Dick (1995 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos808806]);Konrad and Skaperdas (1998[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos823656]); Garoupa (2000[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos814001]); Chang et al.(2005 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos803077]). 2 The difficulties of criminal enterprise extend beyond cooperation within theorganization and to strategic cooperative and noncooperative games with victims,other criminals, and the police. See, for example, Konrad and Skaperdas (1997[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos823457], 1998[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos823656]), Gambetta (1994[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813523]), and Smith andVarese (2001 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos846251]). 3 Successful criminal cooperation within the organization is necessary but notsufficient for the organization to succeed. Characteristics of life outside ofthe criminal organization, such as the local economy, also affect their abilityto thrive. For example, examining the ‘Ndrangheta in Northern Italy, Varese(2006 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos854088]a) arguesthat construction companies’ reliance on illegal workers provided an importantopportunity for the ‘Ndrangheta to establish itself. These two spheres – onewithin the organization and the other being the environment in which theorganization acts – can affect each other too. For example, the reciprocalinfluence between the Yakuza and Japanese films on organized crime led to thelatter's decline and reduced the former's reputational capital (Varese 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos854088]b). 4 For a discussion of the rules governing inter-criminal communication, seeGambetta (2009 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813667]). 5 The NF constitution has changed over the years. I focus on the constitutionas it was originally written. It's taken from a recent history of the NuestraFamilia (Fuentes 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos813023]) and reproducedin the appendix at the end of the chapter. 6 Former law enforcement members have identified other situations in whichorganization members impeached a leader for violating the NF's rules. See, forinstance, Morales (2008[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos834970]). 7 Other gangs also use official complaint processes to coordinate theenforcement of rules. Evidence about the Melanic Islamic Palace of the RisingSun prison gang, for example, sheds light on what happened when a member filed acomplaint accusing another member of being a law enforcement informant in a pastcourt case. The leader recorded the accusation, requested evidence on theperson's guilt, and shared this information with other members who reached theconclusion that the individual was guilty. The gang leaders conveyed theirjudgment, writing “That Melid #2 [the criminal organization's name] havecompetently witnessed by personally reading the [court] transcripts that theinformation contained therein displays a true violation of Sup. Const., Art. V,Cl.5” (Knox 2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos823064]). 8 Gang members who aren't directly harmed by a rule violator's behavior arewilling to aid gang members who are directly harmed because at some point theformer expect to seek the punishment assistance of the latter when a ruleviolator does directly harm them. Gang members who refuse to help theircolleagues now will be refused help by their colleagues in the future. Gangmembers are therefore led through repeated interaction to find it in theirinterest to assist others in enforcing constitutional rules even when they don'timmediately or directly benefit by doing so. This, of course, is an applicationof the discipline of continuous dealings. 9 Monitoring production activities, however, was probably more difficult inpirate organizations than it was in the NF despite pirate organizations’ smallersize and more physically concentrated membership. As Leeson and Rogers (2012[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos826342]) point out,piracy's production activities were necessarily jointly produced and thereforeharder to monitor. In contrast, many of the production activities of the NF areindividually produced and thus easier to monitor."},{"pageContent":"Part IV Self-Governance as Superior to the State"},{"pageContent":" 8 Efficient Anarchy*Can anarchy be efficient? Conventional wisdom unequivocally answers no.1 Byproviding monopolized social-rule creation and enforcement, government enablesindividuals to realize gains from cooperation they couldn't capture without it.Given the choice, welfare-maximizing persons therefore choose to formgovernment. As Nobel Prize–winning economist Douglass North (1981[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos837203]: 24) puts it:“Throughout history, individuals given a choice between a state – no matter howexploitative it might be – and anarchy, have decided for the former.”The ubiquity of government today makes it easy to forget that numerous societieswere stateless for most of their histories and that some remained so well intothe twentieth century. Several of these societies encompassed many people.Consider, for instance, African groups such as the Tiv, which included more thanone million individuals, the Nuer whose population has been estimated at400,000, or the Lugbara with more than 300,000 members. More striking yet is thefact that, globally, the world has always been, and continues to be, ininternational anarchy.The observed absence of government in these environments requires explanation.If conventional wisdom is correct, anarchy is inefficient and government shouldhave quickly replaced vacuums of centralized authority. Why then didstatelessness among numerous societies last so long? For that matter, whataccounts for anarchy's continued presence internationally? In short, how do weexplain the persistence of significant arenas of anarchy over time?2North (1990) suggests that inefficient forms of social organization may persistbecause of path dependence. Path dependence offers one potential explanation foranarchy's persistence, which explains that persistence despite anarchy'sinefficiency. In contrast, this essay explores why in some caseswelfare-maximizing individuals would rationally choose not to form anygovernment at all. It offers a potential explanation for anarchy's persistence,which explains that persistence as resulting from anarchy's efficiency.I examine self-governance's superiority to government when government is ideal.An ideal government works in precisely the way society's inhabitants desire itto. It faithfully uses its coercive monopoly to protect citizens’ propertyrights and promote exchange, and suffers no problems of corruption, rentseeking, or related issues that principal-agent problems create. No suchgovernment actually exists, nor is one possible. Nevertheless, I use idealgovernment in this essay's comparison because it offers the strongestjustification for the state and thus allows me to demonstrate that, even in thiscase, there are important conditions under which anarchy is the sociallyefficient governance arrangement and thus the one that welfare-maximizingindividuals would choose if they confronted such a choice.3 Comparing idealgovernment to anarchy is also useful because such government is the kind mostpersons are wont to imagine when they mentally compare how anarchy might farerelative to government, or indeed imagine government as the solution to anyproblem people face. Chapter 9[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_019.html#filepos568048] illustrates whysuch imaginations are just that and, indeed, why they can be downrightdangerous.4 Here, however, to make my point as strongly as possible, I use idealgovernment as the relevant alternative to anarchy.When Is Anarchy Efficient?The discipline of continuous dealings by itself is capable of supporting somelevel of cooperation under anarchy, albeit, for reasons described already, alimited one. The previous essays in this book suggest that a variety of othermechanisms of self-governance are capable of raising that level. Still, thesemechanisms are highly imperfect. They undoubtedly leave some of the gainsavailable from cooperation on the table.As the traditional rationale for government suggests, by strengtheningindividuals’ security in their property still further, an ideal government canimprove social wealth compared to that under anarchy by permitting individualsto realize some portion of the gains from trade that go uncaptured whenself-governing mechanisms are exclusively relied on for that purpose. Instead ofarguing that ideal governments don't exist (they don't) or that self-governancecan secure the same level of property protection that government can (which itsometimes can), this essay accepts the claim that government is capable ofenabling a higher degree of social cooperation than anarchy is capable ofenabling.For some population of individuals, let H be the sum of the payoffs toindividuals of trade when government is present and let L be the sum of theirpayoffs of the relatively lower level of trade they enjoy when government isabsent, where H > L > 0. Individuals may choose the high-trade equilibrium byintroducing government or the low-trade equilibrium by interacting underanarchy.For government to be efficient and thus for welfare-maximizing persons torationally choose its presence, the cost of government, G, must be smaller thanthe benefits it provides. The benefit of government is the difference betweensocial wealth in the two states of the world just described – that in whichgovernment exists and individuals are in the higher-trade equilibrium, and thatin which it doesn't exist and individuals are in the lower-trade equilibrium.Government is therefore an efficient solution to the social dilemma only if G <H － L. In contrast, where G > H － L, anarchy is efficient. Whether G is actuallygreater than H － L depends on two things: (1) the size of G and (2) the size ofthe gap between social wealth when individuals are in the higher-tradeequilibrium versus when they're in the lower-trade one.The Cost of GovernmentThe cost of an ideal government can be broken into three primary components. Thefirst is the simple organizational cost of creating a state – the cost oforganizing collective action. Concretely, the organizational costs of governmentinclude (1) the decision-making costs of arriving at the specific set of rulesthe state is to enforce and (2) the external costs of collective decisionmaking, which result from the fact that the group will sometimes make choicesthat are privately costly to the individual (Buchanan and Tullock 1962[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos801181]). Theorganizational cost of government thus depends on, in addition to other possiblefactors, the form of government or decision-making process that's followed indetermining what set of rules the state is to enforce.The second cost of government is the cost of enforcing decided-on rules. Thesecosts are expenditures associated with creating and maintaining police andmilitary forces and a court system. Enforcement costs increase as the populationsize increases; it's more expensive to police 1,000 people, for instance, thanit is to police 10. The enforcement costs of government also increase aspopulation heterogeneity increases. Ethnically, religiously, linguistically, andotherwise fractionalized populations are more prone to disagreement, mistrust,and violent conflict than those that are less fractionalized (see, for instance,Alesina et al. 2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos792106]; Alesina andSpolaore 2003 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos792106];Alesina and La Ferrara 2002[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos792333]). Thus thestate's enforcement entities – for instance, the police and courts – aredeployed more frequently for the purposes of preventing and settling disputesamong socially disparate populations than among more homogeneous ones. The formof government influences enforcement costs as well.The third cost of government is the cost of providing public goods other thanthose necessary to enforce decided-on rules (such as the cost of police andcourts, which falls under the enforcement costs of government), but whichcontribute to individuals’ ability to engage in higher levels of trade.5 Roads,which permit interactions between larger numbers of individuals, are an exampleof this. The public goods cost of government is largely determined by the samefactors as government's enforcement costs are. Public goods costs increase asthe size of the population increases, because it's more expensive to supply, forinstance, an adequate system of transportation for a large population than asmall one. Similarly, ceteris paribus, public goods costs will be higher amongheterogeneous populations than among more homogeneous ones (Alesina, Baqir, andEasterly 1999 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos791900]).Where persons have more diverse characteristics, they have more diverse needs,requiring multiple forms of the same public goods (for instance, roadways comingfrom, and going to, different places), which raises the cost of providing suchservices.The Benefit of GovernmentThe factors presented in the preceding section determine G's size. Anarchy'sefficiency, however, depends on the cost of government relative to the benefitgovernment provides by moving society to the higher-trade equilibrium. What,then, affects the size of H － L?The difference between social wealth when individuals engage in higher tradeversus when they engage in lower trade is determined by the potential for gainsfrom exchange. The size of these gains is in turn a function of the range ofexchange opportunities that are available to them. Five main factors affect thisrange:> > > 1. Individuals’ endowments: ceteris paribus, where individuals begin with> > > more disparate endowments, the gains from trading will be larger and vice> > > versa.> > > 2. The size of the potential trading population: a larger population of> > > potential exchange partners means a larger number of opportunities to gain> > > from trading.

Thus social wealth in the lower-trade> > > equilibrium will be higher than it would have been without these> > > institutions (albeit, because of the limitations assumed earlier, still> > > lower than if government existed). The presence of mechanisms of> > > self-governance facilitating exchange thus shrinks the gap between social> > > wealth in the higher- and lower-trade equilibrium. The absence of such> > > mechanisms increases this gap.These five factors together determine the thickness of the market. Thick marketshave many (i.e., widespread) opportunities for exchange and thus generate highgains from trade. In contrast, thin markets have very few opportunities forexchange and thus generate minimal gains from trade.When markets are sufficiently thin, the relative difference in social wealthbetween a situation in which individuals engage in higher trade and a situationin which they engage in lower trade is negligible. This corresponds to the casewhen H － L is very small. Alternatively, when markets are very thick, thisdifference is large.Having established what affects the cost of government and what affects thebenefits government provides by moving society from a lower-trade equilibrium toa higher-trade one, it's possible to distinguish two types of efficient anarchy:“small H － L anarchy,” in which, even though government may be inexpensive tocreate, the difference between social wealth in the higher- and lower-tradeequilibrium is so small as to make the state inefficient on cost-benefitgrounds, and “big G anarchy,” in which, despite the presence of a substantialgap between social wealth in the higher- and lower-trade equilibrium, governmentis too costly to justify its emergence. At least theoretically these aresituations in which statelessness is socially optimal, even compared to an idealgovernment. A population of welfare-maximizing persons operating in eitherenvironment would thus choose anarchy over government.This framework predicts anarchy in two distinct sets of circumstances: one inwhich the absence of trading opportunities makes the benefit of introducing thestate prohibitively small (small H － L anarchy) and one in which the costlinessof the state prevents government from emerging (big G anarchy). I exploreevidence for these predictions in the next section.Two Archetypes of Actual AnarchySmall H － L AnarchyThe first archetype of statelessness – small H – L anarchy – is characteristicof statelessness observed in small, primitive societies.6 The historicalpresence of long-standing, anarchic societies of this variety spans the globe.Consider, for example, societies such as the Eskimo tribes of the North AmericanArctic (Hoebel 1954[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos819408]), Pygmies inZaire (Turnbull 1961[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos850646]), Native Americantribes like the Yoruk (Benson 1989[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos797489]a), the Ifugao ofthe Philippines (Barton 1967[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos796092]), the Massims ofEast Paupo-Melanesia (Landa 1994[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos824309]), South Americannative tribes like the Kuikuru (Dole 1966[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos809544]), the KabyleBerbers of Algeria, the Land Dyaks of Sarawak, and the tribal Santals of India(Barclay 1990 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos795932]),none of which had governments. In some cases primitive anarchic societiesremained anarchic well into the twentieth century. The Kapauku society of WestNew Guinea, for instance, was stateless until about 1960 (Pospisil 1963[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos838679]).In his classic anthropological work, E. E. Evans-Pritchard (1940[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos810848]) des-cribed theNuer society of the southern Sudan circa the 1930s. The Nuer people were farfrom alone in precolonial Africa in eschewing government. The Barabaig, Dinka,Jie, Karamojong, Turkana, Tiv, Lugbara, Konkomba, Plateau Tonga, and others longstood as stateless or near-anarchic societies too.7 The Nuer, however, is amongthe best studied of these groups, and in many ways typifies the features foundamong other primitive stateless societies. For this reason I consider the Nuerexclusively, although it should be kept in mind that the lessons of thisanalysis apply to other primitive anarchic societies with similarcharacteristics.Primitive societies like the Nuer reflect instances in which rational,welfare-maximizing individuals would choose anarchy over government because thedifference between social wealth in the higher-trade and lower-trade equilibriumis extremely small. Because the formation of even the leanest governmentinvolves some fixed cost, and this cost isn't insignificant, a very small H – Lis enough to make anarchy the efficient pattern of social organization.The small gap between payoffs from higher and lower trade in primitive societiesis a function of five main factors, which tend to make potential markets insidethem extremely thin:> > > 1. These societies are often small, meaning there are relatively few> > > opportunities for exchange even if government is introduced. This tends to> > > make lower levels of trade enabled by private institutional arrangements> > > not much less profitable than higher levels of trade that would be> > > possible if government were established.8The size of the relevant trading population is largely determined by the size ofthe population over which government is introduced. Thus, to understand why therelevant potential trading population for the Nuer was very small, we first needto understand why government among the Nuer, if it had been introduced, wouldhave been introduced at a low level – that is, over a small population.The Nuer are among the largest primitive stateless societies.9 The most liberalestimate of the Nuer population is around 400,000 individuals (Barclay 1990[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos795932]). However,Evans-Pritchard, who studied the Nuer most closely, estimated the Nuerpopulation at only half that size. This figure is inclusive of all Nuer groupmembers. This inclusive population was divided into eleven tribes: the Bul,Leek, western Jikany, Nyuong, Dok, Jagei, Gaawar, Thiang, Lak, Lou, and easternJikany. Each tribe was in turn subdivided into numerous sections based onlineage, and these sections were further subdivided into numerous villagecommunities. Nuer communities tended to be extremely close-knit, as they werecomposed of individuals connected by lineage.The largest Nuer organizational unit in which private rules and arbitrationprocedures were respected by other individuals was the tribe. Beyond the boundsof each tribe there was no recognition of such rules or procedures. The largestconceivable level at which government might have been introduced among the Nuerwould therefore have been the tribal level, and even this is questionable.Evans-Pritchard, for instance, indicates that in many cases the largesteffective organizational unit of the Nuer was actually much smaller, perhapssomewhere between the village and tribal levels. This suggests that, weregovernment introduced, it would have been over an even smaller population thanthat of the tribe. The presence of self-governing mechanisms, such as the“leopard-skin chief” who arbitrated disagreements among tribe members, enabledsome exchange between individuals at this level. While introducing government atthe tribal level might increase this exchange somewhat, the small populationinvolved, coupled with private institutions like the leopard-skin chief,suggests that this increase would have been minimal.> > > 2. Individuals in primitive societies typically have very similar> > > productive abilities. Most are either pastoral or horticultural.The Nuer, who were of the pastoral variety, were overwhelmingly a cattle-herdingpeople. Although they were sometimes forced to raise crops (for instance, whenrinderpest destroyed their livestock), a combination of the natural environmentin which they found themselves and Nuer culture created a situation in whichthere was very little differentiation in individuals’ productive capacities.Evans-Pritchard (1940[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos810848]: 55) describedthe fundamental environmental features of Nuerland as follows: “(1) It is deadflat. (2) It has clay soils. (3) It is very thinly and sporadically wooded. (4)It is covered with high grasses in the rains. (5) It is subject to heavyrainfall. (6) It is traversed by large rivers that flood annually. (7) When therains cease and the rivers fall it is subject to severe draught.” While theseconditions allowed for occasional horticulture, hunting, and fishing, theyoverwhelmingly dictated the productive activity of cattle herding of which theNuer were so fond. Production was thus almost exclusively directed at raisingcattle for meat and milk.From top to bottom, Nuer culture was organized around the importance of cattle,which reinforced herding as the virtually exclusive productive activity of theNuer people. As Evans-Pritchard (1940[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos810848]: 18) put it,nearly all of Nuer “social behavior directly concerns their cattle.” This factwas manifested in practices and institutions among the Nuer, from the giving ofnames (which were based on the names of family cattle), to their networks ofkinship ties (which were based on cattle ownership), to rituals and religiousactivities. This intensely focused interest on cattle that was fundamental toNuer culture strengthened the singularly directed aims of Nuer productiveactivities in herding.10 Neither this feature of Nuer life nor the fact that theNuer environment wasn't suitable for much other than cattle herding is to denythat innately occurring comparative advantage among individuals in, say, theproduction of milk versus the production of meat allowed for somespecialization. However, for reasons discussed earlier, the degree of thisspecialization was limited. This in turn limited the gains that could be hadfrom higher levels of exchange, which introducing government might bring.> > > 3. Often (but not always) the individuals who populate primitive> > > societies have homogeneous preferences.As previously mentioned, in the case of the Nuer this preference was nearlyunidimensional and aimed at the ownership of cattle. This lack of diversitytended to diminish the increase in exchange opportunities that introducinggovernment might bring. As Evans-Pritchard (1940[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos810848]: 88) observed,the “Nuer have nothing to trade except their cattle and have no inclination todispose of these; all they greatly desire are more cattle.…This narrow focus ofinterest causes them to be inattentive to the products of other people, forwhich, indeed, they feel no need and often enough show contempt.”11> > > 4.

This form of private arbitration enabled community interaction despitethe absence of government. Similarly, within the same tribe, the institution ofthe feud, which involved specific steps for dealing with more serioustransgressions, was respected by the Nuer and provided a strong incentive forindividuals to refrain from theft and violence.12 The strong presence of thesemechanisms of self-governance raised the relative payoff to individuals in thelower-trade equilibrium, which served to shrink the gap between social wealth inthis and the higher-trade equilibrium and, with it, the benefit of introducing astate.Big G AnarchyAnarchy is also efficient if the cost of government is very large. In this caseeven a substantial gap between social wealth in the higher- and lower-tradeequilibrium may not be large enough to make the state efficient from acost-benefit perspective. In this environment rational, welfare-maximizingpersons confronted with the choice will again be led to choose anarchy overgovernment. Thus big G anarchy is the second archetype of statelessness Iconsider.Instances of big G anarchy are less prevalent than instances of small H – Lanarchy simply because the cases in which G is likely to be massive are also thecases in which government is being extended over a massive population, whichmeans that the potential increase in gains from trading are also massive. It'stherefore harder for the cost of government to be larger than the differencebetween social wealth in the lower- versus higher-trade equilibrium.Nevertheless, one particular instance of big G anarchy is hard to miss:international anarchy. The second half of the twentieth century in particularsaw the growth of supranational organizations aimed at increasing the degree ofcentralized enforcement in the international sphere, such as the World Court andthe United Nations. However, these organizations haven't fundamentally affectedthe anarchic nature of the international sphere in that none of them give final,ultimate authority to the governing body to offer binding decisions on theparties involved. They don't override national sovereignty but instead relyfundamentally on the willingness and voluntary consent of the various sovereignsinvolved. If a sovereign chooses not to appear before such a court or doesn'tabide by the court's decision, no centralized authority exists to compel it todo otherwise. Likewise, no formal supranational authority exists to adjudicateand enforce commercial contracts between private international traders who,because of their differing nationalities, frequently find it impossible orprohibitively costly to use their nations’ domestic state courts to adjudicateand enforce such contracts.It might be presumed that the difference between social wealth in the higher-and lower-trade equilibrium in the international sphere would be verysubstantial given the considerable population of the world. Even if this is thecase, however, the organizational and enforcement costs of a global governmentextending over 6.5 billion people are prohibitively expensive. Consider, forinstance, the substantial increase in organizational costs that would resultfrom most voters (assuming a democratic government) being far removed from theirpublic representatives (at least at the highest level).Organizational costs would also rise considerably because of the vast increasein the heterogeneity of the relevant population. If it's difficult to arrive ata decision regarding where a new police station is to be located within acommunity of 20,000 suburbanites, imagine the difficulty of coming to a muchlarger decision when more than a billion people are involved from Beirut toMexico City. Increased heterogeneity among the relevant population will lead tosubstantial increases in enforcement and public goods costs, for similarreasons. Indeed, as Alesina and Spolaore (2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos792106]) show, theattendant increase in such costs associated with extending government overlarger and more socially diverse populations is a primary constraint on theeffective size of nations. At the size necessary to govern the entire globeeffectively, any economies of scale in having a centralized governancearrangement that might normally exist on the national level are overwhelmed bydiseconomies that exist on the global level.Although it relates to the difference between H – L instead of the size of G,the strong presence of mechanisms of self-governance that facilitate exchange inthe international arena also contributes to anarchy's efficiency in this sphere.Modern-day international trade is based largely on the set of privateinstitutions that governed such exchange when it first emerged on a significantscale in medieval Europe. I briefly considered the medieval incarnation of thisset of institutions, called the lex mercatoria, or law merchant, in Chapter 2[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_009.html#filepos44303].13The medieval law merchant, recall, was a polycentric system of customary lawthat arose from the desire of traders in the late eleventh century to engage incross-cultural exchange. My discussion of the medieval law merchant emphasizedtraders’ use of social-distance-reducing signals to facilitate intergroupexchange without government. One way traders did so was by submittingvoluntarily to the decisions of private merchant courts, or so-called dusty feetcourts because of the dust merchants’ feet collected as they busily traveledbetween commercial fairs across Europe. These private courts adjudicateddisagreements between medieval traders in light of the law merchant's customarylaw.Contemporary international traders continue to make wide use of private courtsas a means of settling disputes in the form of international commercialarbitration. Today at least 90 percent of all international trade contractscontain arbitration clauses (Casella 1996[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos802839]). Among the mostnotable arbitration organizations that exist for this purpose are theInternational Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the London Court of InternationalArbitration (LCIA), the Arbitration Association of the Stockholm Chamber ofCommerce, and the American Arbitration Association's International Center forDispute Resolution (ICDR). In 2001 nearly 1,500 parties from more than 115nations across the globe utilized the services of the ICC alone (ICC 2001[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos820436]). The amounts indispute varied from $50,000 to more than $1 billion, with more than 60 percentof all disputes involving sums of money between $1 million and $1 billion (ICC2002 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos820310]). Similarly,the ICDR arbitrated a caseload in 2001 worth more than $10 billion involvingparties from sixty-three countries across the globe (ICDR 2002[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos820562]).These arbitration associations often rely on evolved customary law that dictateshow exchange disagreements are to be settled, and “arbitral awards are mostgenerally promptly and willingly executed by business people” (David 1985[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos807592]: 357). Indeed,virtually “[e]very research into the practice of international arbitration showsthat by far the great majority of arbitration awards is fulfilled without theneed for enforcement” (Böckstiegal 1984[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos799484]: 49). In a studypublished in 1981, for instance, a survey of international oil traders indicatedthat more than 88 percent of all contracts entered were carried out withoutdispute. Of the remaining 12 percent, respondents indicated that 76 percent ofdisputes were arbitrated successfully by private adjudication (Trakman 1983[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos850302]: 53). The world'slargest international arbitration association, the ICC, estimates that 90percent of all its arbitral decisions are complied with voluntarily (Craig etal. 2000 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos805927]: 404).This high degree of compliance is attributable in large part to traders’reliance on social-distance-reducing signaling and the discipline of continuousdealings.The presence of private institutional arrangements in the international sphere,such as private arbitration and reliance on customary law, enables a substantialamount of trade despite the absence of global government. Consider thestaggering level of international trade. In 2003 world exports of merchandiseand commercial services alone exceeded $9 trillion – nearly a quarter of worldGDP (World Trade Organization 2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos857033]). Althoughwithout centralized enforcement international traders may be situated in thelow-trade equilibrium, this level of trade isn't very low at all and quitepossibly not significantly lower than it would be if an agency of centralizedenforcement were introduced.14 In conjunction with the fact that the cost ofsuch an agency would be extremely high, this suggests that anarchy is the mostefficient way of organizing the international arena. Thus, while some attemptshave been made to introduce bodies of centralized enforcement on the globallevel, it isn't surprising that global anarchy continues to persist.Anarchy's probable efficiency in some primitive stateless societies and on theinternational level doesn't mean statelessness is always or must remainefficient in these areas. For example, if members of primitive societies, suchas the Nuer, had decided to widen their preferences, diversify their productiveactivities further, be more inclusive of other groups, or, what's equivalent,take an interest in interacting with a wider, more diverse population, as thisbook's first essay suggested some precolonial African communities did, thethickness of potential markets would grow and, with it, so too would the gapbetween social wealth in the higher- and lower-trade equilibrium. If this gapgrows large enough, the introduction of a state may become efficient.Clearly, a significant factor contributing to this process – enlarging thenumber and range of individuals who might interact – is partially endogenous togovernment's presence. The establishment of a state may make individuals feelmore secure in interacting with outsiders and thus increase market thickness,which increases the benefit of having a state in the first place. However, itdoesn't follow that introducing government in small H – L anarchies wouldnecessarily make government efficient. In addition to the other factorsaffecting the distance between social wealth in the higher- and lower-tradeequilibrium that aren't endogenous to government, individuals would need todesire to interact with those outside their relatively small communities.15 Inthe case of the Nuer, for instance, it doesn't seem that this was so.More critically, it's important to recognize that the circumstances under whichmy discussion here suggests that anarchy is efficient aren't the only ones underwhich this may be true. Neither are they the most important ones. This essaycompared anarchy to an ideal government – one that doesn't suffer from “publicchoice problems” – which, in fact, all real-world governments do. Those problemscan add substantially to the cost of government, making anarchy efficient in amuch large number of situations. Indeed, as the next essay considers, inpractice such costs of government are often the ones that matter most.* This chapter is based on and uses material from Leeson, Peter T. 2007.“Efficient Anarchy.” Public Choice 130(1–2): 41–53 [© 2007 Springer Science +Business Media B.V.]. 1 David Friedman (1973[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812671]), Murray Rothbard(1977 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos842603]), BruceBenson (1999 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos798285]),and Randy Holcombe (2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos819557]) are rareexceptions in this regard. 2 While no one has addressed this question, a growing literature deals broadlywith the economics of anarchy. See, for instance, Dixit (2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos809369], 2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos809190]) Hirshleifer(1994 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos818803]), and Bateset al. (2002 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos796472]).Dixit's (2003 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos809369])analysis is probably the most closely related to mine in that it considers thelimits of self-governance and when government becomes efficient. 3 This essay also considers the choice between anarchy and (ideal) governmentas considered by a population of persons interested in maximizing socialwelfare. In fact, individuals are interested in maximizing their own personalwelfare, not that of society as a whole. My justification for this analyticaldeparture from reality is that it provides the perspective required to evaluatethe comparative efficiency of anarchy versus government. Such a comparisonrequires a “social planner's perspective,” which I generally abhor, but whichimagining the population's members as welfare maximizers achieves. Of course, Icould adopt this perspective without introducing the fiction whereby apopulation's members also deliberately choose their governance arrangement. Butgiven that my purpose is to explain why, from the perspective of those such asNorth, who describes the popularity of government as a social choice reflectinga concern for efficiency, anarchy's observed persistence in certain arenas canbe understood in similar terms, I also present my discussion in terms ofpopulations choosing on the basis of what maximizes social welfare. 4 It bears emphasis, then, that this essay considers only some of theconditions under which anarchy is efficient. As the next chapter explores,anarchy may also be efficient under other conditions, in particular whengovernment is far from ideal. Further, this chapter compares “total anarchy” –that is, the absence of government for any functions – to (ideal) government. Ifone instead considered cases in which we have “pockets of anarchy” – that is,government existed and protected property in certain kinds of interactions, butfor other kinds government was effectively absent (for example, in blackmarkets) – one would be able to add further to the conditions under whichanarchy is efficient. 5 These goods need not be non-excludable and non-rivalrous, per the classicdefinition of public goods. Roads, for example, are both excludable andrivalrous, and yet government is traditionally viewed as the appropriateprovider of transportation systems. Many, if not most, of the “public goods”traditionally thought of as within the purview of state provision (includingroads) can be provided for privately and have been historically. See, forinstance, Beito et al. (2002[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos797172]). Here, however,I take the traditional view, which assumes that government will provide thesegoods. 6 This isn't to say, however, that anarchy is only efficient and thus onlyarises in situations where H and L are themselves small. H – L can also be smallwhen H and L are both large. For instance, as discussed later, moderninternational trade has a large L because of highly effective privateinstitutions. Thus, adding government may not add substantially to trade, makingH – L small despite the fact that H and L are themselves large. 7 For reference to these and other stateless societies in Africa, see Bohannan(1968 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos800272]) andBarclay (1990 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos795932]). 8 I say presumably here because it's not at all clear that government wouldactually enable a higher level of trade in these societies. There are tribalsocieties that have had governments imposed on them by colonizers and then,following the withdrawal of the colonial government, have economically crashed.In some of these societies, at least, trade was more expansive understatelessness than it was following the imposition of government. Leeson (2005[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos825162]) examines suchcases in precolonial/postcolonial Africa. 9 To my knowledge, only the Tiv and the Lugbara were larger. 10 The Nuer focus on cattle was both a cause and consequence of the culturalcharacteristics described. 11 To satisfy basic dietary requirements to sustain life, the Nuer were forcedto spend some time in agricultural activity directed at producingcarbohydrate-rich foods. In their case this was grain. However, as discussedearlier, for reasons of climate and preferences, the time they spent onagricultural activities was minimal. Evans-Pritchard (1940[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos810848]: 81) describedthe situation as follows: “(1) that Nuer cultivate only enough grain for it tobe one element in their food-supply and not enough to live on it alone; (2) thatwith their present climate and technology considerable increase in horticulturewould be unprofitable; and (3) that the dominance of the pastoral value overhorticultural interests is in accord with oecological relations which favourcattle husbandry at the expense of horticulture.” 12 For an analysis of the feud and leopard-skin chief as institutions ofself-enforcement, see Bates (1983[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos796303]). 13 For discussions of the law merchant, modern and medieval, see, for instance,Mattli (2001 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos832133]),Casella (1996 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos802839]),and Benson (1989[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos797489]b). 14 On the relative unimportance of international treaties that attempt toprovide for the formal enforcement of private international arbitrationdecisions through countries’ domestic state courts for this trade, see Leeson(2008 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos825374]). The“shadow of the state” explanation of large and growing international trade istherefore not a convincing argument. 15 In addition to this, if the benefits that introducing government creates arenot immediate (or at least not completely so), agents will need to besufficiently forward looking for the state to be profitable to adopt. If agentsare sufficiently impatient, or if a significant portion of the benefits fromintroducing government will only come near the end of (or only after the end of)current inhabitants’ lives, government will remain prohibitively costly to meritits introduction. In societies where life spans are not very long, this maypresent a problem. Short-lived persons will find government too costly to adoptand their resulting failure to adopt government will in turn contribute to theshort life span of the next generation, which will confront the same dilemma."},{"pageContent":"9 Better Off Stateless*In the developed world the relationship between state and society is fairlystraightforward. Although rent seeking, public corruption, and government abuseexist, to a large extent developed economies have developed precisely becausethey have succeeded in overcoming these problems. While far from perfect in thisrespect, government in the United States, for example, does a good job ofprotecting citizens’ property rights and uses its monopoly on coercion toprovide public goods that, at least in principle, stand to make society moreproductive.In the developing world, however, the relationship between government andcitizens is often very different. Here many political rulers routinely usegovernment to benefit themselves and their supporters at citizens’ expense.Rather than using state power to protect citizens’ property rights, thesegovernments use that power to prey on society. In the extreme they devolve intolittle more than glorified thuggery, seizing every opportunity to extort theircitizens. Ultra-dysfunctional states not only fail to provide public goods andprotect citizens’ property. They're the primary threat to their citizens’property rights and security.It's common to think that most governments in world are the well-functioningvariety and that the minority are dysfunctional. But this thinking has itbackward. Well-functioning, highly constrained governments that protect propertyrights and supply welfare-enhancing public goods are the exception, not therule. According to the 2007 Failed States Index, nearly 16 percent of theworld's countries (thirty-two) have “failing states” (Foreign Policy/Fund forPeace 2007 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos812116]). Inthem, governments are often ultra-predatory and dysfunctional. According to thisindex, another 49 percent of the world's countries (ninety-seven) are in“warning” mode. Although they have not yet reached the deterioration ofcountries in “alert” mode, they are approaching it. If these measures arecorrect, in more than half the world, states are either critically ordangerously dysfunctional. The world's “experiment” with government, then, hasproduced far more mixed results than most people think. Indeed, if we're tograde this experiment as a solution to the social dilemma by the share of theworld's countries in which that solution has clearly succeeded, we must gradegovernment a failure.Dysfunctional and predatory governments are disproportionately located in thepoorest countries, which raises an important question about the link betweenstate and economic development in the developing world. Is it possible that someleast-developed countries could actually perform better without any governmentat all?This essay makes a simple point: although a properly constrained government maybe superior to statelessness, it doesn't follow that any government is superiorto no government all. If a state is highly predatory and its behavior goesunchecked, government may not only fail to add to social welfare; it may reducewelfare below its level under anarchy.1 As John Stuart Mill (1848[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos834035]: 882–883) put it:> [O]ppression by the government…has so much more baneful an effect on the> springs of national prosperity, than almost any degree of lawlessness and> turbulence under free institutions. Nations have acquired some wealth, and> made some progress in improvement in states of social union so imperfect as to> border on anarchy: but no countries in which the people were exposed without> limit to arbitrary exactions from the officers of government ever yet> continued to have industry and wealth.To investigate anarchy's welfare implications compared to government whengovernment is dysfunctional, I examine the case of Somalia. In several respectsSomalia is typical of many least-developed countries (LDCs). Like most otherLDCs, Somalia is located in Sub-Saharan Africa. Similar to other countries inthis region, Somalia was a former European colony, achieved independence, andsubsequently came under the rule of a brutal and highly predatory politicalregime. Somalia is different from other LDCs in one important respect, however:it has no government.In 1991 Somalia's state collapsed, creating anarchy in its wake. Although therehave been several attempts to resurrect central government in Somalia –including an ongoing one – none has yet succeeded, leaving the countryeffectively stateless. Somalia therefore provides an interesting naturalexperiment to explore the idea that if government is predatory enough, anarchymay actually prove superior in terms of economic development.There has been much hand-wringing over what to do about the situation of anarchythat has characterized Somalia since 1991. Reports from internationalorganizations commonly express fear about the “chaos” of Somalia without astate. According to the World Security Network, for example, under anarchySomalia has had “no functioning economy.” Instead, “clan-based warfare andanarchy have dominated” it (Wolfe 2005[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos856184]). Shortly afterSomalia's government collapsed, the United Nations was similarly “gravelyalarmed at the rapid deterioration” of Somalia and expressed serious “concernwith the situation prevailing in that country” (UN Resolution 751 1992[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos850979]: 55). The popularpress has tended to go even further in its condemnation of the “internalanarchy…[that] has consumed Somalia” (Gettleman and Mazzetti 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos814510]). The viewcommonly presented by these observers is that Somalia has “been mired in chaossince 1991” when statelessness emerged (Hassan 2007[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos817684]).To be sure, this concern isn't without cause. In the year following the state'scollapse, civil war, exacerbated by severe drought, devastated the Sub-Saharanterritory, killing 300,000 Somalis (Prendergast 1997[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos839071]). For a time itseemed that Somali statelessness would mean endless bloody conflict, starvation,and an eventual descent into total annihilation of the Somali people. Thusconventional wisdom sees Somalia as a land of chaos, deterioration, and war, andis certain that statelessness has been detrimental to Somali development.The reason for this belief is twofold. On the one hand, conventional wisdom seesgovernment as unexceptionally superior to anarchy. Government is considerednecessary to prevent violent conflicts like those that erupted when Somalia'sstate first crumbled, which disrupt economic activity. Government is alsoconsidered critical to supplying public goods such as roads, schools, and lawand order, which are important to the process of development. From thisperspective, it's easy to conclude that Somalia, which has no centralgovernment, must have been better off when it had one.Second, there's a tendency, upon observing problems in distressed regions of theworld, to concentrate only on the “failure” of the current situation, ignoringthe quite possibly even worse state of affairs that preceded it (or could followit).2 This is especially easy to do for Somalia, which by internationalstandards is far behind indeed. Educational enrollment is abysmally low – as of2001, a mere 7 percent for combined primary, secondary, and tertiary schooling.Average annual income is less than $1,000 (PPP), and preventable diseases likemalaria are a genuine threat to Somalia's inhabitants. These facts, however, saynothing about the status of Somalia before its state collapsed. ForgettingSomalia's experience under government, it's easy to imagine that nothing couldbe more damaging to Somali development than anarchy.To investigate statelessness’ impact on Somali development, I compare the stateof eighteen key development indicators in Somalia before and after itsgovernment collapsed. These indicators are comprehensive in covering all anglesof development for which data were available pre- and post-statelessness as of2007. While it's important to avoid romanticizing Somalia, the data suggest thatstatelessness has improved Somali development substantially. On nearly allindicators Somalia performs significantly better under anarchy than it did undergovernment. This improvement has been made possible by renewed vibrancy in keysectors of the economy and public goods following the collapse of government andof government predation along with it.My analysis of Somali data stops in 2005. Thus, although my description ofSomalia under anarchy uses the present tense, unless otherwise noted itdescribes Somalia circa 2000–2005. Since then the situation in Somalia haschanged somewhat. For example, in late 2006 Somali conflict renewed when theinternational community–backed Transitional Federal Government (TFG) attemptedto oust the Supreme Council of Islamic Courts (SCIC), which controlled thesouthern Somali city of Mogadishu. This conflict disrupted the relativelylong-lasting period of peace that preceded it, resurrecting the violence Somaliahad largely under control leading up to this. As I discuss in greater detaillater in this chapter, in early 2007 the TFG succeeded in taking control ofMogadishu. However, like previous attempts to reinstate government in Somalia,the TFG's authority proved extremely weak and didn't succeed in establishing anew central government in Somalia.In August 2012 the expiration of the TFG's tenure led to the establishment ofthe Federal Government of Somalia (FGS), which, unlike its predecessors, issupposed to be permanent. Although in some respects the FGS has a stronger claimto statehood than previous efforts to recreate central government in Somalia, itwould be premature in the extreme to declare this most recent effort toreestablish government the end of Somali anarchy. Indeed, as the United NationsSecurity Council (2013[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos853059]: 12) reported inJuly 2013: “At present, Al-Shabaab” – an offshoot faction of the SCIC – “remainsin control of most of southern and central Somalia.”It thus remains to be seen whether present efforts by and on behalf of the FGSwill succeed in establishing what might meaningfully be called a government, orwhether, like previous attempts to recreate a Somalia state, this one, too, willfail. Until the FGS has proved durable and wields substantially more authorityin Somalia than it does currently, it's appropriate and accurate to continue tocharacterize the country as anarchic, as I do in this and the next chapter.The Grabbing Hand: Somalia under GovernmentIn 1960 British Somaliland and Italian Somalia gained independence from theircolonizers and joined together to form the Republic of Somalia. A bloodless coupin 1969 led by Major-General Mohamed Siad Barre overthrew the democraticgovernment that ruled Somalia since independence. Barre went on to take powerand established an oppressive military dictatorship.3 He reigned for twenty-oneyears until 1991, when Somalia's government collapsed and statelessness ensued.Under the influence of the Soviet Union, in 1970 Barre transformed his militarydictatorship into a socialist one. Full-scale central planning pursued under thegovernment's policy of “scientific socialism” brutalized the Somali people. Thegovernment slaughtered civilians who posed threats to the government's plans orpolitical power, used coercive intimidation to create artificial support for itsactivities, and forcibly relocated others to further the political or economicends of Barre and his cronies. “Both the urban population and nomads living inthe countryside [were] subjected to summary killings, arbitrary arrest,detention in squalid conditions, torture, rape, crippling constraints on freedomof movement and expression and a pattern of psychological intimidation” (AfricaWatch Committee 1990[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos791067]: 9).The state ruthlessly suppressed free speech and controlled all forms ofinformation reaching Somalis. Newspapers (only one was officially permitted bythe government), radio, and television were fully censored and dissent in anyform squelched with force. Under Somalia's National Security Law No. 54,“gossip” became a capital offense. Twenty other basic civil freedoms involvingspeech, association, and organization also carried the death penalty.The state invested aggressively in building its military. Besides weapons andtroops for foreign defense, massive resources were devoted to militarystructures of domestic repression. Government created a secret police squadcalled the National Security Service and paramilitary unit called the VictoryPioneers for spying on and eliminating dissenters. Both had legal discretion todetain, invade, kill, and torture at the state's behest (Africa Watch Committee1990 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos791067]).This state of affairs had a twofold dire effect on development in Somalia. Onthe one hand, it left few resources for investment in welfare-enhancing publicgoods such as education, health, or transportation infrastructure. This wasespecially so in pastoral areas where most Somalis lived (Little 2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829092]: 15). On theother hand, Barre's military dictatorship eliminated any vestiges of restrainton the government's predatory power. Law No. 1 repealed the constitution and alldemocratic checks. There were no elections for any political positions: Barreappointed them all. Military suppression prevented popular uprising. Evendissent through free expression was eliminated. Government was let loose toplunder and abuse citizens for political rulers’ ends.The Somali state was notoriously corrupt and violent. Political actors andbureaucrats embezzled state funds, extorted and murdered weak portions of thepopulation, and engaged in aggressive asset stripping of state-owned firms. Asthe UN Development Program characterized it, “The 21-year regime of Siyad Barrehad one of the worst human rights records in Africa” (UNDP 2001: 42). This is nosmall feat considering that during this period Africa was home to some ofhistory's most savage dictatorships, including the Democratic Republic ofCongo's Mobutu.In 1975 all land was nationalized along with nearly all major industries and thefinancial sector. This facilitated government's ability to expropriate citizens’property for state projects, like massive state-operated farms, and forpoliticos’ personal use. Unpopular minority groups, such as the Gosha, wereparticularly easy prey. In the 1970s and 1980s Barre expropriated Gosha-occupiedland to create state-owned irrigation schemes that benefited his allies. Inother cases his minions expropriated land for their private use, turning Goshainto serfs on their own property (Menkhaus and Craven 1996[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos833082]).State control of industry in Somalia created inefficiencies similar to thoseexperienced in the Soviet Union. Between 1984 and 1988, for instance, thegovernment-owned Kismayo Meat Factory was open only three months per year.Government also owned tanneries. The “Hides and Skins Agency” paid herders lessthan half the market value of hides to process in these factories. These firmsalso utilized only a tiny fraction of their capacity. All told, capacityutilization of Somalia's state manufacturing firms was less than 20 percent(Mubarak 1997 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos835813]:2028).Incentives to be productive, keep costs down, or cater to consumer demands werevirtually absent. Factory managers cared only about meeting quotas. This ledthem to pursue wasteful activities, such as purchasing inputs worth more as rawmaterials than the output they produced (Little 2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829092]: 39). Somestate-owned enterprises were developed purely to benefit political rulers andtheir friends. For instance, government created the Water Development Program tosubsidize private watering holes for the livestock of Barre's allies.In the late 1970s Barre abandoned full-blown socialism to attract foreign aidfrom the IMF. However, government continued to rely on central planning.“Parastatal companies continued to receive subsidies, foreign aid was channeledthrough state institutions and the state remained sole arbiter in the allocationof profitable contracts. Private sector autonomy was further curtailed bypolitical patronage, which was the easiest way to access resources controlled bythe state” (UNDP 2001: 140). In the 1980s there was only one bank in Somalia,state owned and operated. Government used it to keep afloat failing public firmsand to reward political supporters. Only state enterprises or politicallywell-connected Somalis were able to obtain loans (Mubarak 1997[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos835813]).Government also remained involved in most other important economic sectors.Livestock and pastoral-product exports have long been critical to Somalia'seconomy. In the 1970s Barre nationalized most of this trade and continued tocontrol it throughout the 1980s. Government restricted imports and exports andintroduced a bewildering array of regulations. Foreign exchange controls werealso strict. They required exporters to exchange at least half theirforeign-exchange earnings at the state-set rate, which in 1988 overvalued theSomali shilling to the U.S. dollar by more than 120 percent (Little 2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829092]). This benefitedwealthy political patrons who consumed imports, but it decimated Somalia'sexport industry.In the 1980s Somalia's government turned to inflation to finance its corrupt andbankrupt projects. Between 1983 and 1990 average annual depreciation of theSomali shilling against the U.S. dollar was more than 100 percent. In some yearsdepreciation exceeded 300 percent (Little 2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829092]). Hyperinflationdestroyed the savings of Somalis who managed to accrue modest sums over time. Italso incapacitated the monetary unit as a means of economic calculation.Government's willful mismanagement of public resources prevented the state frombeing self-supporting. Eager to woo Somalia from the influences of EasternEurope, international development agencies filled the shortfall with massiveinflows of foreign aid. By the mid-1980s 100 percent of Somalia's developmentbudget and 50 percent of its recurrent budget was funded by foreign aid (UNDP2001: 118). In 1987 more than 70 percent of the state's total operating budgetwas financed this way (Mubarak 1996[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos835663]).The early 1980s saw a temporary spike in government expenditures on items suchas education. But by the late 1980s the weight of nearly twenty years of rampantpredation, repression, and state control had reduced Somali welfare tohorrifically low levels. Well prior to the government's collapse theagricultural economy was in shambles, and malnutrition and starvation werecommonplace (Samatar 1987[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos843163]). In the 1980sSomalia had one of the lowest per capita caloric intakes in the world (UNDP2004). At the end of the decade government spent less than 1 percent of GDP oneconomic and social services, while military and administration consumed 90percent of the state's total recurrent expenditure (Mubarak 1997[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos835813]).Government consistently used state resources to privilege members of Barre'sclan at others’ expense. “The Barre regime awarded certain client groupspreferential access to arable land and water.…Indeed, the Somalia case is a goodexample of ethnic (and clan) favoritism where private land-grabbing in the Jubbaand Shebelle Valleys favored the late president's clan, the Marehan, whilealienating other groups” (Little 2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829092]: 36). Forexample, in 1988 Barre supported Marehan herders’ unlawful appropriation ofOgaden water points in Southern Somalia.Barre's “ethnic favoritism” created tension between Somali clans. In the late1980s exploited clans reacted by forming faction groups like the SomaliPatriotic Movement (comprised largely of Ogaden), the Somali National Movement(comprised largely of Isaaq), and the United Somali Congress (comprised largelyof Hawiye). United against government's predation on non-Marehans, they joinedforces to oust Barre. Unfortunately, the interclan tensions Barre created didn'timmediately disappear with him. The seeds of clan conflict sewn by twenty yearsof divide-and-rule policy erupted into violence when government crumbled.4The Hidden Hand: Somalia under AnarchyIn 1988 civil war broke out in the northern part of the country (Somaliland),setting in motion the beginning of the end of government in Somalia. In January1991 a coup d'etat toppled Barre's regime, creating statelessness in its wake.5Tellingly, the same year anarchy replaced government, 400,000 Somali refugees inEthiopia returned to their homes in Somalia (UNDP 2001: 59). For the next twoyears, rival factions fought to establish power. These were the days when Somali“warlords,” such as General Hussein Aideed of Mogadishu and Ali Mohamed Mahdi,battled to solidify their bases of strength. At the same time severe droughtstruck the country, creating famine in its aftermath. In 1992 the UN sent troopsto Somalia to quell the conflict and ease suffering, but failed to establishauthority, stability, or peace in the region.6Some fighting continued into the mid-1990s, but died down considerably since1991. By the late 1990s peace prevailed over most of Somalia. Until 2006, whenthe attempted reestablishment of central government sparked new violence,conflict was isolated and sporadic, confined when it did occur to pockets ofsmall-scale rivalry in a few areas (Menkhaus 1998[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos832747], 2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos832910]; Nenova 2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos836182]). Important tothis expanding peace was expanding commerce, discussed later in this chapter(Menkhaus 2004 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos832910];Nenova 2004 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos836182]).Most depictions of Somalia leading up to the 2006 period grossly exaggerate theextent of Somali violence. In reality fewer people died from armed conflict insome parts of Somalia than did in neighboring countries that have governments.In these areas security was better than it was under government (UNDP 2001).About the same number of annual deaths in Somalia during this period – roughly 4percent of the total – were a result of complications at childbirth as wereattributable to war (UNDP/World Bank 2003: 16). And these war-related deathswere combatants, not civilians. Indeed, “[a]trocities against civilians…[were]almost of unheard of” (Menkhaus 2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos832910]: 30). This isstill too high, but far from cataclysmic. In fact, it's not far from thepercentage of homicide deaths in middle-income countries such as Mexico, whichin 2001 was 3.6 (WHO 2006).In 2006 “a loose coalition of clerics, business leaders, and Islamic courtmilitias known as the Supreme Council of Islamic Courts (SCIC)” gainedincreasing dominance over key areas of Somalia, including the capital, Mogadishu(CIA World Factbook 2007[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos803611]). In response theinternational community–backed Transitional Federal Government (TFG) attackedthe SCIC, leading to a battle for power. In the short run, at least, thisconflict reversed the strides toward more peaceful anarchy that Somalia hadlargely succeeded in creating prior to the TFG-SCIC clash. The TFG's victoryover the SCIC set the stage in 2012 for the establishment of the FGS, whichsucceeded the TFG following the expiration of the latter's interim mandate andis intended to be the new permanent central government of Somalia.Improved Overall Human DevelopmentThere's no statistical office in Somalia to collect economic, demographic, orother types of data that could be used for regression analyses.7 Even before1991 government collected almost no such information. However, the UNDP, WorldBank, CIA, and World Health Organization have collected sufficient data toconduct a study that allows us to compare Somali development before and afterstatelessness emerged. To do this I examine all development indicators inSomalia for which data were available pre- and post-statelessness as of 2007,using figures for the most recent year that was available in each case. Eighteenkey development indicators allow for comparison. I consider the last five yearsof government preceding the emergence of statelessness (1985–1990) and the mostrecent five years of Somali anarchy (2000–2005) for which data were available asof 2007.Before considering the results of this analysis, it's important to underscoreseveral features of the comparison. First, because my data stop in 2005, mycomparison doesn't capture any change in Somali performance on these indicatorssince that time. Second, this analysis compares Somalia under government toSomalia under anarchy circa 2000–2005, not to Somalia anarchy in the period ofintense civil war immediately following government's collapse circa 1991–1992.Of course, when state collapse coincides with high levels of armed conflict,economic development isn't possible. Third, while highly suggestive, these datamust be interpreted with caution. The correlation presented here cannotestablish causation. In addition to the possibility that state collapse is thereason for the improvements we observe in Somali development over this period,it's possible that other factors may have contributed to this improvement. Idiscuss what these factors may be and their plausibility relative to thegovernment-collapse hypothesis later.Data for the pre-1991 period come from the United Nations Development Program's(UNDP) Human Development Report-Somalia 2001 and the World Bank/UNDP's (2003)Socio-Economic Survey in Somalia. Data for the post-stateless period are fromthe CIA World Factbook (2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos803343]), UNDP's (2001,2006) Human Development Report, the World Health Organization's WHO SomaliaAnnual Report 2003 (2004), and the World Bank/UNDP (2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos856780]) Socio-EconomicSurvey in Somalia. Table 9.1 contains all eighteen indicators and the results ofthe pre- and post-statelessness comparison.Table 9.1.

Of the eighteendevelopment indicators, fourteen show unambiguous improvement under anarchy.Life expectancy is higher under anarchy than it was in the last years ofgovernment's existence; infant mortality has decreased 24 percent; maternalmortality has fallen more than 30 percent; the number of infants with low birthweight has fallen more than 15 percentage points; access to health facilitieshas increased more than 25 percentage points; access to sanitation has risen 8percentage points; extreme poverty has plummeted nearly 20 percentage points;the number of one-year-olds fully immunized against tuberculosis has grownnearly 20 percentage points, and for measles that number has increased 10percentage points; fatalities from measles have dropped 30 percent; and theprevalence of TVs, radios, and telephones has jumped between three andtwenty-five times.Per capita GDP (PPP) is lower than its 1989–1990 level, but the data overstatethe size of average income in the pre-1991 period, which was likely lower thanit is under anarchy. Three sources of bias inflate pre-1991 per capita GDP as ameasurement of well-being. First, firm managers in planned economies have strongincentives to overreport output to meet quotas or obtain rewards (Shleifer andTreisman 2004 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos844568]).Although Somalia officially abandoned socialism by 1980, the state continued toplay a significant role in production until its collapse. In this environmentfirm managers likely inflated reported output, leading to artificially high GDPfigures. Second, under government a great deal of Somali production was militaryhardware that citizens didn't consume. In fact, to the extent that this hardwarewas used to suppress the Somali population, this sizeable portion of pre-1991GDP was actually negative value added from the perspective of citizens’ welfare.Finally, in the pre-stateless period Somalia was one of the largest per capitaforeign aid recipients in the world (UNDP 2001). In fact, “[p]re-war Somalia wasconsidered a classic case of an aid-dependent state” (UNDP 2001: 118). By themid-1980s foreign aid was 58 percent of Somali GNP (UNDP 1998: 57), compared toonly 9 percent as of 2001 (UNDP 2001). In 1987 more than 70 percent of thestate's operating budget was financed by foreign aid (Mubarak 1996[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos835663]). And beforegovernment collapsed, nearly 100 percent of Somali education was financed byforeign aid (UNDP 2001: 120). This discrepancy inflates pre-1991 GDP per capitacompared to per capita income under statelessness.If it were possible, accounting for fictitious production under government, thenegative value added of military expenditures, and the foreign-aid gap wouldlikely reduce Somalia's pre-1991 average income level below its post-1991level.8 The dramatic increase in post-1991 Somali consumption depicted in thedata corroborates this fact. A substantial observed rise in consumption withoutan attendant rise in per capita GDP suggests an unmeasured increase in percapita income between the pre- and post-anarchy periods not reflected in thedata.Only two of the eighteen development indicators in Table 9.1 show a clearwelfare decline under statelessness: adult literacy and combined gross schoolenrollment. Given that foreign aid was completely financing education in Somaliapre-1991, it's unsurprising that there has been some fall in school enrollmentand literacy. This is less a statement about the Somali government's willingnessto generate welfare-enhancing outcomes for its citizens than it is a reflectionof foreign aid poured into Somali education by the international developmentcommunity before government collapsed.9Importantly, the indicators in Table 9.1 also don't measure the substantialincrease in personal freedoms and civil liberties enjoyed by Somalis underanarchy. The Somali government ruthlessly suppressed free speech, censoringnewspapers, radio, and television. Most forms of free expression were punishableby death, and foreign travel was severely restricted. Under statelessness, incontrast, Somalis are free to travel as they please (restricted only bygovernments of other nations) and enjoy greater freedom of expression, bothprivately and publicly. Twenty private newspapers, twelve radio and televisionstations, and several Internet sites provide information to the Somali public(Reporters Sans Frontieres 2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos840816]). Satellite-basedtelevisions enable the transmission of international news services, includingCNN (Little 2003 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829092]:170–171). Authorities in Somaliland and Puntland have attempted to interferewith media providers in their territories, but freedom of expression remainsimproved compared to its status under government. This constitutes an additionalimportant, albeit unmeasured, increase in Somali welfare under anarchy.As a point of comparison, it's useful to consider Somalia's developmentimprovements from the 1985–1990 period to the 2000–2005 period relative tomovements in the same development indicators in its neighboring countries,Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Kenya. Looking at these countries helps interpret thefindings in Table 9.1. In particular, it helps establish if Somalia'sdevelopment improvements were the result of its predatory government's collapseand substitution with anarchy, or if Somalia would have experienced the sameimprovements even if it had remained under government simply because “it wastime” for Somalia to improve. Similarly, this comparison helps establish if, forinstance, the rise of new information technology in this part of Africa isresponsible for Somali improvement and would have occurred with or withoutgovernment collapse, or rather if there's something unique about Somalia –namely the collapse of its predatory state – that accounts for Somalia’progress.In Table 9.2 I perform this comparison for all development indicators that datapermit. I calculate the percent improvement (+) or decline (–) for eachindicator in each of Somalia's neighbors between the 1985–1990 period and the2000–2005 period. The comparisons are unavoidably rough in the sense that theydon't compare the precise years from Table 9.1 in all cases. Further, they failto capture the fact that Somalia's government was more predatory than thegovernments of Djibouti, Kenya, or Ethiopia. Thus the experiences of thesecountries provide imperfect points of comparison that tend to understate thedifference between Somalia's strides under anarchy and the strides it wouldlikely have made under Barre. Nevertheless, they're sufficient to address thegeneral question I’m interested in.Table 9.2.

Consistent with Table 9.1, Somalia performsworse on adult literacy compared to its neighbors between the periods. Still, onthe majority of the indicators considered here Somalia improved more than itsneighbors over the same period, suggesting that the collapse of governmentresulted in greater development improvements than would have occurred in itsabsence. In several cases Somalia has been improving while its neighbors havebeen declining.Although this analysis helps exclude some alternative factors that might bedriving Somali improvement apart from state collapse, only a tentativeconclusion can be drawn on the basis of the available data. Further, thecomparison in Table 9.2 doesn't help exclude other possible sources of Somalia'simprovement unrelated to anarchy. For example, the period of Somalia's statecollapse coincides with the rise of a large Somali diaspora, which supports anenormous remittance economy that has undoubtedly been important to Somalia'simprovement. Similarly, in 1993–1994 UNOSOM intervened in Somalia and providedlarge quantities of humanitarian and other aid to Somali citizens, which mightalso have contributed to Somalia's improvement without government.While the importance of these factors can't be definitively decided, there'sstrong reason to be skeptical that they, rather than state collapse, areresponsible for the improvements in Somali welfare depicted in Table 9.1. Forexample, rather than an independent cause of Somali improvement understatelessness, the rise of Somali remittances after government's collapse islikely a result of government's collapse. In stateless Somalia remittances arehandled through the hawilaad system, discussed later in this chapter, a privateand self-governing financial system for transferring remittances sent to Somaliafrom abroad. Under Barre's government, however, the hawilaad system'spredecessor, the franco valuta system, which served a similar purpose, waseventually criminalized, making it more difficult to remit finances to Somalia.When the government collapsed, this barrier was removed, leading to the growthof Somali remittances under anarchy.Similarly, although UNOSOM's intervention provided critical humanitarian aid tomany Somalis, its effect on the situation in Somalia wasn't exclusivelypositive. UNOSOM's presence led to surges in Somali violence, both againstUNOSOM and between competing factions, which feared a shift in the balance ofpower that UNOSOM's presence threatened to create. Thus in addition to providingresources, which likely helped Somali development, UNOSOM also spurredadditional violence, which likely inhibited Somali development.Another factor that complicates my analysis is Somaliland and Puntland, the twonorthern regions of Somalia, both of which, nominally at least, have some kindof government. Somaliland declared itself a fully independent sovereignty in1991. Puntland, in contrast, identified itself as an independent territorywithin Somalia in 1998. Although Puntland and Somaliland both have“governments,” and thus more formal structure than the southern part of Somaliain the period my data consider, these “states” are weak at best. Neither isrecognized as a state by the international community. Further, neither exhibitssome of even the most basic characteristics we associate with governments. Forexample, the “governments” in Puntland and Somaliland don't have a monopoly onthe law or its enforcement. Although some public laws and courts exist, in bothregions the legal system functions primarily on the basis of private, customarylaw and mechanisms of enforcement – the same self-governing legal institutionsthat govern the southern portion of Somalia – which I discuss later (Notten 2005[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos837539]).Similarly, neither Somaliland nor Puntland has proved very successful inextracting taxes from their citizens. In Puntland, government's “[r]evenuecapacity is very limited” (UN 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos851297] III: 6).Likewise, Somaliland suffers from “weak revenue collection capacity” (UN 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos851297] IV: 3). Inaddition to this, similar to southern Somalia, in both Puntland and Somalilandthe private sector delivers many, if not most, public goods (UN 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos851297] III, IV). CallingPuntland or Somaliland “governments,” then, is misleading. It's more appropriateto think of these as ultra-minimal states, if it's appropriate to think aboutthem as states at all.Unfortunately there are little data that would allow for a disaggregatedexamination of Somali improvement in the post–state collapse period.Nevertheless, in Table 9.3 I present all of the disaggregated data I could findas of 2007 that allow for a comparison of Puntland and Somaliland development toSomalia's development overall to try to get some sense of how these differentregions might be influencing the overall figures presented in Table 9.1.Table 9.3. Somalia disaggregated-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GDP per capita ($US) Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 livebirths) Maternal mortality rate (per 100,000) Population with accessto water (%) Population with access to sanitation(%) Somalia a 226 114.89 1,100 29 26 Somaliland b 250 113 1,600 45 47 Puntland c – 133 – 25.9 41.5 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------> > Notes: aSee Table 9.1; bUN (2006> > [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos851297] III); cUN> > (2006 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos851297] IV).Only five indicators allow at least partial comparison. What they suggest ismixed. Somaliland has substantially better access to water and sanitation thanSomalia does overall. On the other hand, Somaliland fares worse on maternalmortality than Somalia does overall and has about the same GDP per capita andinfant mortality rate. Puntland also has significantly better access tosanitation, but does worse than Somalia overall on access to water and infantmortality. Although disaggregated data that would allow for a thoroughcomparison are lacking, these figures suggest that while Puntland and Somalilandmay be “pulling up” Somalia overall on certain indicators, they may be “pullingdown” or not really influencing Somalia overall on several others. The UNDP(2001) reports that Puntland and Somaliland are doing better than southernSomalia, which may well be the case. However, it doesn't seem that these regionsare the exclusive locations of post-Barre progress in the country. Still, theabsence of additional data renders any judgments along these lines verytentative. It's therefore important to keep in mind that the indicators reportedin Table 9.1 don't disaggregate the regions of Somalia, and thus reflect overallconditions that include both citizens in Puntland and Somaliland, as well ascitizens in the southern portion of Somalia.The Sources of Somalia's ProgressEconomic AdvanceMuch of the credit for Somalia's improved development under anarchy belongs toits economy, which has been allowed to grow in the absence of governmentpredation. Although economic advance has been uneven, “in some areas, the localeconomy is thriving and is experiencing an unparalleled economic boom” (Mubarak1997 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos835813]: 2027).Somalia's cross-border cattle trade with Kenya is particularly instructive ofthis progress. Livestock is the most important sector of the Somali economy. Itconstitutes an estimated 40 percent of Somalia's GDP and 65 percent of itsexports (CIA World Factbook 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos803343]). Examiningchanges in the cross-border cattle trade before and after statelessness istherefore a useful way of establishing changes in Somalia's economy underanarchy.According to data from the Kenyan Ministry of Agriculture and LivestockDevelopment collected by Peter Little (2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829092]), Somalia'sexport of cattle to Kenya more than doubled between 1991 and 2000. Figure 9.1provides an event study investigating the effect of statelessness on Somalia'scross-border cattle trade.[images/00003.jpg]Figure 9.1. Cross-Border Cattle TradeThis figure examines changes in the Somali-Kenya cross-border cattle tradebetween 1989 and 2000. These data draw on the cattle trade at Garissa, the mainKenyan border district and a major livestock trading market in the Kenya-Somaliborderlands. The dashed vertical line at 1991 demarcates the emergence ofanarchy. Between 1991 and 2000 the value of the cattle trade increased 143percent and its volume increased 132 percent. Between 1989 and 2000 the valueand volume of the cattle trade increased 250 and 218 percent, respectively. Evenduring the most intense period of civil war between 1991 and 1992 the cattletrade grew substantially.This growth tends to understate the true increase in cross-border cattle tradesince the onset of statelessness. In 2000 severe drought struck Somalia, andKenya closed its border to Somali livestock for fear of importing animalsinfected with Rift Valley Fever.10 This depressed livestock trade in the finalyear for which I have data, shrinking its growth for the 1991–2000 period.Between 1991 and 1998, for instance, the value of cattle traded at Garissa grew400 percent, and between 1989 and 1998 this trade grew 600 percent. In terms ofvolume, annual sales grew from less than 25,000 cattle in 1989 to more than100,000 by 1998.Further, these data reflect only official cross-border cattle exports fromSomalia to Kenya. They don't include the substantial cattle trade that occurswithout the Kenyan government's approval. In 1998 unofficial exports enteringKenya from the Lower Jubba region alone add an estimated 70,000 cattle to thesedata (Little 2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829092]: 38).The frequency of larger-scale livestock traders has also grown understatelessness. In 1987–1988, 80 percent of livestock traders had annual salesbetween 1 and 600 (small scale). Only 20 percent had annual sales above thislevel (large scale). By 1998 the percentage of large-scale traders had doubled(see Table 9.4).Table 9.4. The growth of large-scale livestock traders-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- % of traders Annualsales 1987–1988 1996 1998 1–300 50 17 34 301–600 30 18 26 601–900 – 20 5 901–1,200 5 28 22 1,200 15 17 13 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------> > Notes: Data from Little (2003> > [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829092]).Information about crime in stateless Somalia can also be gleaned from thissector. The cross-border livestock trade is facilitated by brokers (dilaal) whocertify for buyers and sellers that traded livestock aren't stolen. Dilaal incurliability if livestock they certify is illegitimate. In this capacity they actas insurance for cross-border traders. Data on brokers’ fees pre- andpost-anarchy suggest that fees haven't risen under statelessness. Between 1988and 1998 dilaal fees remained the same (Little 2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829092]: 109). If theftincreased between 1988 and 1998, we would expect dilaal fees to have risen. Thefact that they didn't suggests that, at least in the sizeable livestock sector,theft didn't increase under anarchy. In fact, dilaal fees are lower on theSomali side of the cross-border trade than they are on the Kenyan side,suggesting that theft may be more problematic in Kenya, which has a government,than in Somalia.The livestock sector's expansion under anarchy isn't limited to cross-bordertrade with Kenya. During the 1990s Somalia accounted for more than 60 percent ofall livestock exports in East Africa. In the northern part of Somalia(Somaliland and Puntland) production and annual exports of sheep and goats fromthe major ports of Berbera and Bossaso have surpassed their pre-1991 levels(Little 2003 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829092]:37–38). In 1999 these two ports alone were responsible for 95 percent of goatand 52 percent of sheep exports for all of eastern Africa (Little 2001[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos828732]: 194).Nor is Somalia's economic improvement under statelessness limited to its largesteconomic activity. Other sectors that have grown under anarchy include serviceand hospitality. A large part of this progress has been in telecommunications.Local providers have joined forces with multinationals like Sprint, ITT, andTelenor to provide cheap, high-quality, and extensive service (UNDP 2001: 107;The Economist 2005). Transportation is also a growing service industry inSomalia. In addition to local transportation services, Somali-owned airlinesprovide international service for Somalis. By 1997 fourteen firms operatingsixty-two aircraft were up and running, an improvement over this industry'sstatus under government (Nenova 2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos836182]). In thehospitality sector, “unprecedented” construction has taken place in Mogadishuand other major urban centers (UNDP 2001: 203), facilitating the growth of newrestaurants and hotels. “In Hargeisa, Mogadishu, and Bosasso, investments inlight manufacturing have expanded, indicating local investor confidence in theeconomy and local security” (UNDP 2001: 39).An improved monetary climate has also contributed to Somalia's statelesseconomy. Inflation was a significant problem pre-1991, when government turned tothe printing presses to fund its corrupt activities. Skyrocketing inflation madeit increasingly difficult to purchase consumables. It also created businessuncertainty and distorted monetary calculations of economic participants.Although the monetary situation in Somalia remains problematic, under anarchythe Somali shilling (SoSh) has been more stable.The SoSh was the official currency of pre-1991 Somalia. Post-1991 there was nogovernment to mandate its usage. Still, the SoSh continued to trade on the worldmarket. Under anarchy the SoSh, along with the U.S. dollar, is the basis ofSomalia's private monetary system.11 In the absence of a central bank ortreasury, both of which nominally surfaced only in 2009, this means thatprimarily old notes circulate. However, in some cases discussed later, privateparties have printed new currency, adding to the SoSh supply. Figure 9.2examines the SoSh/U.S. dollar exchange rate between 1986 and March 2000.[images/00004.jpg]Figure 9.2. SoSh/U.S. Dollar Exchange RateThe first dashed line in 1991 indicates the emergence of anarchy. Under Barre'spredatory regime the exchange rate soared. Steep depreciation drove the SoShfrom SoSh 110 per $1 in 1986 to SoSh 5,700 per $1 by 1991. Following the coup,the exchange rate fell precipitously to SoSh 4,200 per $1, despite the fact thatSomalia was in the throes of civil war. Under statelessness the SoSh has shownsignificantly greater stability. It lost significant value against the dollartwice during this period – first around 1996, and then after March 1999. Thesedates, indicated by the second and third dashed lines, mark two monetaryincreases. The first was instigated by the Mogadishu-based warlord, HusseinAideed, who imported new shillings he had printed abroad to fund his faction'sactivities. The second was instigated by the fledgling Transitional NationalGovernment (TNG) in the spring of 1999. In an attempt to establish the TNG as aformal authority, its supporters imported SoSh 30 billion they had printed inCanada.Following 2000, TNG supporters added further to Somalia's money supply, leadingto additional depreciation against the dollar. Nevertheless, the average annualrate of depreciation under anarchy is still only a fraction of its size undergovernment. In just the last four years under government (1986–1990) averageannual depreciation of the SoSh was nearly 120 percent. In the first nine yearsof statelessness (1991–2000) average annual depreciation of the SoSh was justslightly higher than 6 percent. The 2000 monetary injection of TNG supportersboosted the 1991–2001 average to around 14.7 percent, and subsequent injectionsdepreciated the currency further.12 Still, money appears to be more stable underSomali anarchy that it was under the last years of government.The SoSh's improved stability is also reflected by the fact that, at least untilthe early 2000s, in parts of neighboring Ethiopia the SoSh was used moreextensively than Ethiopia's own currency (Little 2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829092]: 144). In fact,prior to the large monetary injections in Somalia in March 1999 and then in2000, the SoSh showed greater stability than did the national currencies of bothEthiopia and Kenya. From 1996 to February 1999 the SoSh depreciated only 12.14percent against the U.S. dollar. Between 1996 and 1999 the Kenyan shilling lost32.55 percent against the U.S. dollar and the Ethiopian birr depreciated 26.58percent against the U.S. dollar.13Somalia's financial market has also improved under statelessness. Numerousremittance firms mentioned earlier, called hawilaad, handle an estimated $500million to $1 billion sent by members of the Somali diaspora to their friendsand family in Somalia each year (UNDP 2001). Hawilaad are instrumental inconnecting Somalis with the resources they need to survive and expand theirenterprises. At least one of the Mogadishu-based firms is multinational, withbranches in countries throughout the world (Little 2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829092]; UNDP 2001).Remittance businesses are also morphing into private depository/lendinginstitutions and may contribute to the development of a Somali banking sector.Some offer travelers checks and non-interest-bearing deposits, make small loans,and perform other bank-related services (Nenova 2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos836182]). Although stillin its nascent stages, Somalia's financial sector affords greater access to mostSomalis under statelessness than it did under government when financial services(especially loans) went exclusively to public enterprises and political allies(Mubarak 1997 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos835813]).As a result, under anarchy “Somalis lend and borrow and extraordinary amount ofmoney to one another” (Menkhaus 2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos832910]: 34).The financial sector hasn't been alone to attract attention from multinationalbusinesses. Others have also found stateless Somalia an attractive place toinvest. Dole Fruit, for instance, has invested in Somalia. General Motors’ Kenyasubsidiary has as well. Coca-Cola Company operates in Somaliland, and the BBChas forged a formal affiliation with one of Somalia's emergent media companies.Several international companies have expressed interest in investing inSomalia's energy industry, and numerous fishing fleets from Europe and Asia havereached agreements for commercial fishing in Puntland (Little 2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829092]: 166–167). TheSomali economy has a long way to go, but in many ways it has progressed sincestatelessness emerged.Improvement in Public GoodsSupporting the growth of the Somali economy is an improved public goods sector.Welfare-enhancing public goods provision remains extremely low, especially inSomalia's rural areas. However, like Somalia's economy, they show progress underanarchy. While factions are able to “tax” Somalis traveling on roadways theycontrol, taxes and restrictions on Somalis’ movement and trading activities aresubstantially lower under statelessness than they were under government. “Taxes,payable to a tentative local authority or strongman, are seldom more than 5%,security is another 5% (more in Mogadishu), and customs duties are next tonothing. There is no need to pay for licenses, or to pay to put up masts” (TheEconomist 2005). Further, it doesn't seem that Somalis are any less likely toenjoy the benefits of fees paid to militia leaders than they were when they paidconsiderably higher taxes to government (Little 2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829092]: 7–9).Public goods come from a variety of sources in stateless Somalia, including the“taxes” charged by militia. Clan militias provide security to citizens in theirterritories, and militiamen for hire protect businesses, seaports, largemarkets, and trade convoys. In other cases shari'a, a form of religiouslaw/courts discussed later, provide security by including guards in their courtmilitia in return for payment from businessmen (UNDP 2001: 109–110). Clanleaders also work together to provide needed public goods in areas outside ofSomalia's big cities where few exist.Law and order is provided privately by xeer, Somali customary law, whichestablishes rules regarding marriage, war, resource use, and social contractsbetween clans. It's also supported by diya, which defines rules regarding thepunishment of misconduct, such as murder or theft. Although some secular courtsexist, shari'a courts perform an instrumental function in creating legal order.Private courts are funded by the donations of successful businessmen who benefitfrom the presence of this public good in urban centers. Under anarchy disputeresolution is free and speedy by international standards (Nenova 2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos836182]; Nenova andHarford 2004 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos836182]).This constitutes an important improvement in the provision of law and ordercompared to before 1991. Under government the legal system was often used as atool for preying on Somali citizens and punishing the opposition (Africa WatchCommittee 1990 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos791067];Menkhaus 2004 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos832910]).“[H]arassment, arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, denial of a fair public trial,and invasion of the home were common features of the life of the Somali citizen”(Hashim 1997 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos817505]:90). Rampant corruption and political pressures rendered the police andjudiciary useless for most Somalis.Because of the state's collapse, private providers of law and order have beenfreed to step in. Somalia's stateless legal system is far from perfect. Thejustice system is still subject to abuse, and the climate in a number of areasremained insecure even before the renewed conflict of late 2006. Nevertheless,there has been improvement compared to the situation under government. “[I]nsome parts of Somalia, local communities enjoy more responsive and participatorygovernance, and a more predictable, profitable, and safer commercial climate,than at any time in recent decades” (Menkhaus 1998[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos832747]: 220).Education has also benefited in important ways under anarchy. There are moreprimary schools in stateless Somalia than there were in the late 1980s undergovernment (UNDP 2001: 84), and their number is growing. The number of formalschools has increased from 600 in 1990 to 1,172 under statelessness (UNICEF2005b). There are many Koranic schools as well. These focus mostly on the Koran,but students also learn Arabic. Higher education has benefited similarly bystatelessness. There was only one university in Somalia prior to the emergenceof anarchy. Under statelessness universities have emerged in Borama, Hargeisa,Bossaso, and Mogadishu. These universities offer subjects from computer skillsto accounting. According to UNICEF, although the state of education in Somaliaremains poor, there's evidence of “gaining momentum in the education sector”(UNICEF 2005a: 2) and improving children's literacy and numeracy.Somalia's “private sector has [also] proved to be a relatively effectiveprovider of key social services, such as water or transport” (UNDP 2001: 42).Transportation for freight and people connects even small villages in Somalia tomajor urban centers and is relatively inexpensive (Nenova 2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos836182]). A state-ownedelectricity provider opened in Hargeisa in 2003. However, most Somalielectricity is provided privately. Water needs are also supplied by privatefirms. Private social insurance provides a safety net financed throughremittances from abroad. These remittances average $4,170 annually per household(Ahmed 2000 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos791400]:384). Expansive, domestic clan-based social networks also provide socialinsurance. In hard times private welfare can contribute as much as 25–60 percentof household income (UNDP 2001: 68). Private health care is also available.Although the state of medicine in Somalia remains extremely low, medicalconsultations are affordable ($0.50/visit) (UNDP 2001: 108). Further, thepercentage of Somalis with access to a medical facility has nearly doubled since1989–1990 before statelessness emerged. Privately provided public goods like“education and health care services…and utility companies such as electricityand water, are also providing new income generating and employmentopportunities” (UNDP 2001: 39) that have further contributed to Somalia'seconomic improvement.Recognition of Somalia's improved performance under anarchy compared to undergovernment isn't to deny that Somalia could be doing much better. It clearlycould. Nor is this to say that Somalia is better off stateless than it would beunder any government. A constitutionally constrained state with limited powersto do harm but strong enough to support the private sector may very well do morefor Somalia than statelessness can. Further, Somalia's improvement under anarchydoesn't tell us whether continual improvement is possible if Somalia remainsstateless. It's possible that, past some point, to enjoy further development,Somalia might require a central government capable of providing more widespreadsecurity and public goods. De Long and Shleifer (1993[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos808179]), for example,show that while preindustrial European countries under “feudal anarchy”performed better in some ways than did those under absolutist autocracies,countries under limited government performed better than did both. While it'simportant to keep this is mind, it's equally important to keep in mind that thiswasn't the type of government that collapsed in Somalia twenty-two years ago.The relevant question for Somalia's future is whether a government, were astable one to reemerge, would be more like the constrained variety we observe inthe West or more like the predatory variety that systematically exploitedSomalis between 1969 and the emergence of anarchy in 1991. In the latter case,even if Somalia's ability to improve is constrained by statelessness, Somalidevelopment may still be better served under anarchy than it would be undergovernment. For reasons I elaborate in the next chapter, if “good government”isn't one of the options in Somalia's governance opportunity set, anarchy may bea constrained optimum. Among the governance options that are available incountries with histories similar to Somalia's – ultra-predatory government orstatelessness – statelessness could be superior.In August 2000 select Somali clan leaders gathered in Djibouti at the urging ofthe international community. At this meeting they established the TNG in anattempt to reestablish formal government in Somalia. The TNG, while remaining inname for three years, failed to establish authority. It was crippled by a lackof popular support and an inability to raise tax revenues. The terms of the TNGexpired in 2003. This gave rise in 2004 to the TFG, led by Abdullahi YusufAhmed. The plan was for the TFG to go to Mogadishu and set up the new centralgovernment. However, strong divisions among the members of the TFG initiallyprevented this. Instead of creating a new government, the TFG effectivelyfractured into two new rival faction groups that didn't fundamentally differfrom the “warlord”-led factions they sought to replace.In May 2006 the TFG and the SCIC, which provided the basis of Somalia's privatelegal system, entered into a conflict over control of Mogadishu and other keyareas in Somalia. With Ethiopia's assistance, in early 2007 the TFG succeeded intaking control of the capital city. The renewed violence that this attempt toreestablish government in Somalia created upset the relative peace and stabilitythat preceded it in the earlier period of Somali anarchy. Perhaps surprisingly,however, Somalia's private sector didn't totally collapse in the face of the newviolence. As one Mogadishu-based electronics store owner commented, for example,even “[a]fter the fighting between the Islamists [the SCIC-backed militia] andthe warlords [the TFG-backed militias], people are still buying computers. Thesecurity [situation] is very, very good” (Tek 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos849174]: 31).Further, while it's certain that this conflict was harmful to the progressSomalia achieved leading up to it, what little data we have on Somalia shortlyfollowing that conflict suggests that it didn't totally reverse the stridestoward improvement that were made since 1991. As of 2007, the only twodevelopment indicators from Table 9.1 available for that year, infant mortalityand life expectancy, both showed improvement not only over their levels underSomali government, but also over their levels in 2006. The improvement wasminimal in only one year, but is present nevertheless. Infant mortality fellfrom 114.89 to 113.08 per 1,000 and life expectancy rose from 48.47 to 48.84years (CIA World Factbook 2007[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos803611]).The TFG-SCIC struggle wasn't the last conflict created by the attemptedreestablishment of government in Somalia, however. Like the TFG and the TNGbefore it, the FGS lacks the domestic support needed to establish authority. Theresult is a continued, violent struggle for power, each new instance of whichagain threatens the progress Somalia has achieved under anarchy. “In 2012 inMogadishu,” for instance, “some 6,680 civilian casualties sufferedweapons-related injuries, many of them from improvised explosive devicesdeployed by Al-Shabaab. Data collected by human rights and humanitarian agenciesdemonstrate that pro-Government forces have also caused civilian casualties as aresult of aerial attacks and naval and ground engagement” (United NationsSecurity Council 2013[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos853059]: 9).Leading up to the establishment of the FGS, three of the greatest disruptions ofrelative stability and renewed social conflict in stateless Somalia occurredprecisely in the three instances that a formal government was most forcefullyattempted: first with the TNG, later with the TFG, and finally when the TFGmobilized violently to oust the SCIC. In each case the specter of governmentdisturbed the delicate equilibrium of power that exists between competingfactions and led to increased violence and deaths from armed conflict (Menkhaus2004 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos832910]). Theseexperiences suggest that by upsetting this delicate balance of power again,current efforts to reestablish government in Somalia may similarly lead to more,rather than less, conflict and to new obstacles to progress.* This chapter is based on and uses material from Leeson, Peter T. 2007.“Better off Stateless: Somalia Before and After Government Collapse.” Journal ofComparative Economics 35(4): 698–710 [© 2007 Association for ComparativeEconomic Studies. Published by Elsevier Inc.]. 1 Moselle and Polak (2001[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos835473]) provide atheoretical model demonstrating when this is the case. 2 This remains a common problem in evaluations of Russia as well. As withSomalia, the tendency here has been to focus on the significant defects thatremain without an appreciation of the fact that, however severe these troublesare, they pale in comparison to the troubles of Russia under communist rule.Russia is undoubtedly better off today than it was under socialism. See Shleiferand Treisman (2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos844568]). 3 As is often the case in dictatorships, technically, the Somali “constitution”of 1979 guaranteed democratic elections for its “president.” In practice,however, this guarantee was worthless. The first “election” for Barre was in1986 in which he received 99.9 percent of the votes (U.S. Library of Congress2006 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos851297]). 4 The application of this terminology to Barre's regime is from Little (2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829092]). 5 When Somalia's government first collapsed, clans in the northwestern part ofSomalia declared this territory an independent sovereignty called the Republicof Somaliland. Somaliland continues to exist, though unrecognized by the globalcommunity. In 1998 a number of clans in neighboring eastern portions of northernSomalia also declared themselves autonomous, forming Puntland. UnlikeSomaliland, Puntland does not aim at independence from Somalia, but instead seesitself as an independent territory within Somalia. Although Puntland andSomaliland (to a lesser extent) both have “governments,” and thus more formalstructure than does the southern part of Somalia, these “states” remain weak atbest. Neither “government,” for instance, has exhibited the ability to raisesignificant revenue through taxation. Somaliland and Puntland also disputeterritory along their border, creating confusion about which entity governs whatand contributing to the stateless or quasi-stateless atmosphere in both. 6 After the UN evacuated the country in 1995, rather than deteriorate, theSomali economy actually improved (Little 2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829092]: xvii). 7 The “governments” in Somaliland and Puntland have been able to collect somestatistics, but nothing substantial or that covers Somalia as a whole. 8 The census information used to calculate pre-1991 per capita GDP in Somaliais also controversial (UNDP 2001: 57) and, if understated, would furtheroverstate per capita GDP under government compared to statelessness. 9 Furthermore, according to one source at least, overall enrollment in Somaliamay actually be higher than its peak in the 1980s (Nenova 2004[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos836182]). 10 Saudi Arabia also banned livestock exports from Somalia during this periodowing to the Rift Valley Fever. 11 Somaliland also has its own currency, the Somaliland shilling. 12 Calculated using data from Little (2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829092]) and UNDP (2001). 13 Calculated using data from (IMF 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos820645]) and Little (2003[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos829092])."},{"pageContent":"10 An Argument for Anarchy in LDCs*Somalia's experience highlights the importance of comparing really existinganarchy to the really existing government that might replace it. For the rest ofthe least-developed world, where governments exist, Somalia's experiencehighlights the importance of comparing really existing governments to the reallyexisting anarchies that might replace them.Anarchies and governments come in a range of qualities, from very-high-quality(or close to ideal) anarchies and governments, which are highly functional, tovery-low-quality anarchies and governments, which are highly dysfunctional.Without explicitly acknowledging as much, the approach most commentators takewhen comparing anarchy and government is to compare high-quality government withlow-quality anarchy. Somalia, considered in the previous chapter, is a case inpoint. Most everyone who sees central government as a solution to the current“chaos” created by anarchy imagines replacing that anarchy with a Western-stylegovernment – a government that looks and operates similar to the highlyfunctioning ones that exist in the countries from which such persons typicallyhail, rather than a least-developed country (LDC)-style government, such as thebrutal and predatory one that actually dominated Somalia's reality under MohamedSiad Barre. This is problematic: comparing high-quality government tolow-quality anarchy is sensible only if the anarchy one expects would prevail ina particular circumstance is of the most dysfunctional kind and the governmentone expects would prevail in that same circumstance is of the most functionalkind.In the least-developed world in particular, such an expectation seems very muchunwarranted. I doubt anyone believes that, say, American-quality government ispart of Somalia's current “governance opportunity set.” But for those who might,I encourage looking at Somalia's present attempt at statehood: the FGS. Thisattempt is but a year old. Yet, before even becoming what we might meaningfullycall a government, it's already pre-symptomatic of very-low-quality government.For example, according to the United Nations Security Council (2013[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos853059]: 23), “Despitethe change in leadership in Mogadishu…the misappropriation of public resourcescontinues according to past practices and patterns.” The FGS, it seems, issimply “recycling many of the patterns of corruption of the past.” This ishardly surprising given that “widespread manipulation, financial bribes andthreats occurring before and during the September 2012 Parliamentarian andPresidential elections” characterized the process of establishing the FGS (UNSecurity Council 2013[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos853059]: 154; 144).To take one example of recurring predation, “the CBS [Central Bank of Somalia]has effectively functioned as a ‘slush fund’ for” private patronage “rather thanas a financing mechanism for Government expenditures” (UN Security Council 2013[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos853059]: 155). Indeed, anestimated 80 percent of funds withdrawn from the central bank have been forprivate purposes rather than the public purposes for which the funds areintended. Another familiar pattern is the use of official armed forces toplunder Somali citizens. “Government forces and affiliated militias havecommitted a range of abuses against civilians, including looting in civilianareas, as well as arbitrary arrests and detentions, often for purposes ofextortion” (United Nations Security Council 2013[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos853059]: 34).The reason high-quality government isn't part of Somalia's current governanceopportunity set is that, as in all countries, in Somalia too, exogenous factors,such as the country's “history,” shape and constrain what quality governancearrangement of any kind it has among its feasible governance alternatives. Forexample, “following the collapse of the Government, Somalis did not considerlooting national assets in customary law terms as stealing. Such attitudesbecame institutionalised as a sense of entitlement in successive transitionalauthorities with public and private officials seeking personal profit frompublic resources.” Because of this history, “the systematic misappropriation,embezzlement and outright theft of public resources have essentially become asystem of governance” in Somalia (United Nations Security Council 2013[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos853059]: 154).The idea that “history matters” in this way is no more than a recognition thatcreating the possibility for moving from a governance system of lower quality toone of significantly higher quality requires time, sometimes significant time,as the experiences of several struggling post-socialist transition countriesattest. Although an extremely low-quality government similar to the one thatgoverned Somalia before its state collapsed is certainly within Somalia'scurrent governance opportunity set, Western-quality government almost certainlyisn't.It's possible in some cases that historically created constraints on a country'sgovernance opportunity set might operate asymmetrically on the quality ofanarchy that would prevail if that country eschewed government relative to howsuch constraints might operate on the quality of government that would prevailif that country relied on this governance arrangement instead. For example, acountry whose culture strongly emphasizes tribal cleavages may permit adisproportionately better-functioning anarchy than government, owing to itsability to better leverage the discipline of continuous dealings within smallin-groups. In this case the same set of governance constraints (a culture thatemphasizes tribal cleavages) would present anarchy of some quality x, but onlygovernment of quality x － y, as feasible governance alternatives.On the other hand, a country whose culture emphasizes cosmopolitanism may permita disproportionately better-functioning government than anarchy, because anarchyin such an environment would have a harder time leveraging the discipline ofcontinuous dealings effectively, whereas government wouldn't confront such aproblem. In such a case the same set of governance constraints (a culture ofcosmopolitanism) would present government of some quality f, but only anarchy ofquality f － g, as feasible governance alternatives.While such asymmetries are possible, in general it seems that a given array ofconstraints on a country's governance opportunity set will present governanceoptions – anarchies or governments – of roughly the same quality. The governanceopportunity set a particular country confronts will tend to consist ofhigh-quality governments and high-quality anarchies, or low-quality governmentsand low-quality anarchies, making these the relevant comparisons, rather thancomparisons between high-quality government and low-quality anarchy. Because ofits far less constrained governance opportunity set, the United States, forinstance, has among its governance alternatives both high-quality governmentand, I suspect, high-quality anarchy. In contrast, because of its far moreconstrained governance opportunity set, the Democratic Republic of Congo, forexample, faces a more sobering choice: one between very low-quality governmentor very-low-quality anarchy.The comparison between nearly ideal government and nearly ideal anarchy isinteresting to consider. But it's also relatively unimportant. In countries withvery-high-quality governments, welfare is already very high and, even in thebest case for anarchy, little is likely to be gained by a major departure fromthe existing governance arrangement. Further, as the previous chapter pointedout, the majority of the world's governments are much closer to theextremely-low-quality end of the spectrum than they are toextremely-high-quality end. More than half of those governments, recall, are onor near the cusp of failure. In terms of potentially improving the plight ofsuffering populations, then, the important comparison to consider is betweenlow-quality government and low-quality anarchy, not their high-qualitycounterparts. No matter your evaluation of anarchy versus government for thedeveloped world, your evaluation of anarchy versus government for the poorestpart of the developing world should, I think, be substantially more disposed toanarchy as a realistically superior governance arrangement. Building on theprevious chapter's discussion, I explain why in the section that follows.Conditions for First-Best GovernanceTo achieve high-quality government, a country's political institutions mustsatisfy four conditions:> > > 1. Binding constraints on political rulers: to protect individuals’> > > private property rights, political actors require power. However, to> > > ensure political actors don't abuse this power for personal gain, using> > > their authority to violate citizens’ property rights rather than> > > protecting them, binding constraints on rulers are necessary.

Government-supplied public goods: to protect individuals’ property> > > rights, at a minimum, government must have the power to provide courts and> > > police needed to satisfy institutional conditions (2) and (3).> > > Additionally, the power to provide critical infrastructure, such as that> > > which connects individuals in different parts of the country, and goods,> > > such as basic education and health, may also be required to support> > > individuals’ ability to realize the opportunities for social cooperation> > > that government-supplied property protection creates.The alternative, and necessarily lower-quality, governance opportunitiesavailable to a country that doesn't satisfy one or more of the foregoingconditions depend on which of these conditions it doesn't satisfy. Statedsomewhat differently, a country's lower-quality governance alternatives dependon the particular reason why it has failed to secure high-quality government.For example, the governance options available to a country that has effectiveconstraints on political actors and the power to provide police and courts, butwhose government has difficulty producing other public goods, are different fromthose available to a country that fails to supply binding constraints onpolitical actors.For reasons described earlier, this chapter is concerned with LDCs, which arecharacterized by a failure to achieve high-quality government because of afailure to satisfy institutional condition (1): constraints on political actors.In what follows I therefore consider the case in which a country that doesn'tachieve high-quality political governance doesn't to do so because it doesn'tsatisfy this condition. Legal and police institutions in LDCs also tend to beadministered poorly and ineffectively from the perspective of their ostensiblepurpose, which is to facilitate social cooperation. Similarly, public goods arepoorly provided in such countries. However, these deficiencies shouldn't beconfused with a dearth of power to supply legal or police institutions, orpublic goods, or such institutions’/goods’ total absence, nor should they beconfused with those institutions’/goods’ ineffectiveness in achieving the actualends to which political actors in such countries apply them. As I discuss later,these institutions/public goods are the primary tools political actors use toachieve their predatory purposes where government is unconstrained. Theirineffectiveness from the standpoint of improving social welfare is a by-productof the absence of binding constraints on political actors, not a result ofpolitical actors’ powerlessness to provide them, their absence, or theirineffectiveness in securing the goals political actors seek through them.Anarchy as a Governance Second Best in LDCsMultiple aspects of LDCs’ “histories” can preclude high-quality governments fromappearing among their current governance opportunity sets. They do so bypreventing the satisfaction of institutional condition (1): constraints onpolitical rulers. Such aspects include, for example, ethnic conflict, thepresence of abundant natural resources and subsequent long-lasting fights overtheir control, and substantial experiences with socialism.Histories of ethnic conflict have a close relationship with unconstrained,predatory government (see, for instance, Easterly 2001[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos810288]; Easterly andLevine 1997 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos810473]). Inmany LDCs, members of one ethnic group had power and, absent constraints ontheir behavior, preyed on rival ethnic groups to benefit members of their owngroup. Later, one of these rival groups secured enough strength to overthrowthose in power, asserting itself as government. In this capacity the ill-willshown toward its group's members was repaid in its turn at the helm, andgovernment's ability to arbitrarily wield power, which facilitated suchbehavior, remained intact to permit this – and so on in a vicious cycle. Theresult is a history of unconstrained and highly predatory government thatperpetually uses its authority to extort citizens for the benefit of politicalrulers and those they favor.A similar situation has often prevailed in the case of natural resourceabundance. Free to exploit this low-hanging fruit, some resource-rich countriesnever developed effective institutional constraints on the state, such assafeguards against arbitrary government takings and other violations ofcitizens’ private property rights. In some cases governmental constraints weredeliberately eschewed to facilitate the exploitation of rich resources. As aresult, a history of unconstrained government began and, alongside it, a historyof struggle to gain political power so as to have greater control over the chiefsource of economic opportunity in the country (see, for instance, Auty 2001[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos794936]; Baland andFrancois 2000 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos795242];Wick and Bulte 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos855288]; Mehlum, Moene,and Torvik 2006 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos832563];Robinson, Torvik, and Verdier 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos841825]; Torvik 2002[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos849937]).The same is true of many LDCs’ experiences with socialism. In the 1960s and1970s, for example, when many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa were gainingindependence from their European colonizers, under the influence of the SovietUnion or of their own accord, many turned to economic central planning. As Hayek(1944 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos818022]) pointsout, central planning as a form of economic organization requires government tohave the authority and discretion needed to direct national economic activity,and requires political actors to have autonomy from citizens’ desires that mightconflict with their plan.1 If government doesn't have ultimate authority todirect economic resources, or citizens’ competing ideas about how resourcesshould be used are allowed to interfere with the central plan, the plan'scoherence is undermined and government's ability to centrally direct the economybreaks down. Because of this dynamic, constrained politics is incompatible withcentral planning. Thus the selection of this mode of economic organization insome LDCs at their time of independence, or shortly after, facilitatedunconstrained government, which created an institutional precedent thatpersisted long after these countries abandoned full-blown central planning.These constraints on the governance opportunity sets confronted in LDCs do morethan simply exclude high-quality government from those sets. Because they tendto preclude the satisfaction of institutional condition (1) – constraints onpolitical rulers – as opposed to one of the other conditions, they tend torestrict political governance alternatives to the lowest-quality sort, or what Icall predatory government.Predatory government is characterized by political actors who, because they'reunconstrained, systematically abuse political authority for personal benefit.Such abuse can take many forms, from expropriation, to preferential treatmentfor a small, politically connected minority, to the persecution, arbitraryarrest, incarceration, and even execution of political enemies or other pocketsof the population politicos may target. This includes both explicitly corrupt(i.e., officially criminal) acts and legalized forms of related behavior, suchas the confiscation of property and participation in rent-seeking activities.Classic examples of predatory governments include some of the governments onefinds in Sub-Saharan Africa, such as Somalia's government before it collapsed in1991 and the government of Sierra Leone, which I consider later.A useful way of thinking about how the exclusion of high-quality government fromsome LDCs’ governance opportunity sets because of a failure to satisfyinstitutional condition (1) affects which of the governance opportunities thatremain in those sets is superior is in terms of what Lipsey and Lancaster (1956[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos828365]–1957: 11) called“The General Theory of Second Best.” As they developed that theory:> [T]he general theorem for the second best optimum states that if there is> introduced into a general equilibrium system a constraint which prevents the> attainment of one of the Paretian conditions, the other Paretian conditions,> although still attainable, are, in general, no longer desirable. In other> words, given that one of the Paretian optimum conditions cannot be fulfilled,> than an optimum situation can be achieved only by departing from all other> Paretian conditions. The optimum situation finally achieved may be termed a> second best optimum because it is achieved subject to a constraint which, by> definition, prevents the attainment of a Paretian optimum.We can apply this kind of thinking to governance opportunities in LDCs. Ifinstitutional condition (1) required for ideal political governance – bindingconstraints on political actors – isn't satisfied, as it tends not to be in thepoorest parts of the developing world, the second-best governance arrangementcan be achieved only by departing from institutional requirements (2)–(4):government power to provide law, enforcement, and public goods. That is,conditional on government being unconstrained if it exists, welfare may bemaximized if doesn't.The reasoning here is straightforward. If government is unconstrained,fulfilling conditions (2)–(4) enables predatory government – it creates the verymeans of such predation. For example, an unconstrained government may usestate-supplied law to arbitrarily punish political enemies and reward friends;it may use the state-supplied police to enforce its arbitrary will on citizensand suppress dissenting members of the population; and it may use its power toproduce and allocate public goods to further expand its authority, centralizecontrol, and privilege a small minority at the expense of the majority. Theprevious chapter illustrated how, when government predation is severe enough, itcan depress a country's welfare below that obtainable without any government atall. Thus, where first-best governance – high-quality government – can't beachieved, low-quality anarchy, which can be achieved, may constitute thesecond-best governance alternative.This book has highlighted how when government is absent and thus fails toprovide the institutional means of social order, individuals develop privateinstitutions for that purpose instead. This suggests that citizens who sufferunder predatory government can at least partly overcome what such governancearrangements don't provide. What the foregoing discussion suggests individualscannot so easily overcome is that which such governance arrangements do provide:state-sponsored predation. Anarchy, in contrast, leverages what citizens cancope with – the absence of politically supplied social order – and avoids whatthey largely cannot cope with: political predation.Somalia and Its CohortMy preceding remarks embellish the basic point from the previous chapter:low-quality anarchy can outperform predatory government, which in the poorestparts of the world are often the only two styles of governance available incountries’ governance opportunity sets. The question for the least-developedworld, where predatory governments flourish, is whether, following this logicand the evidence adduced for Somalia, they might also benefit from exchangingpredatory government for anarchy. Here I explore that question empirically. Nodirect or conclusive evidence of how LDCs in general might fare under anarchyrelative to their current, predatory governments is possible. But some indirectand suggestive evidence of how they might fare is. That evidence is found incomparing Somali welfare under anarchy to welfare in other Sub-Saharan Africancountries, several of which are governed by predatory governments.Before proceeding I should make explicit a point that I presume you have alreadygleaned: owing to the governance constraints discussed earlier, I take Somalianarchy to be an instance of low-quality anarchy rather than high-qualityanarchy. If this is correct, according to the standards of appropriatecomparison discussed earlier, comparing development under Somali anarchy todevelopment under other LDCs’ predatory, and thus low-quality, government isreasonable. If I’m wrong, and Somali anarchy is in fact of the high-qualityvariety – for instance, the type of anarchy one could reasonable expect toprevail in a country such as the United States – then my comparison isn'treasonable. I believe that common sense, and the broad similarity of Somalia'shistory to that of other LDCs, supports my judgment about the quality of anarchywe observe in Somalia. But if your judgment differs substantially, theimplications of the subsequent analysis will of course differ.I begin by comparing the state of development in anarchic Somalia with one ofthe LDCs currently closest to state collapse: Sierra Leone. I consider SierraLeone because in this country little would be needed to permit anarchy toemerge. Indeed, if the international community simply ceased its efforts toprevent anarchy from emerging, this would probably be enough for it to do so.Consider Table 10.1, which presents data for twenty-eight key developmentindicators that permit comparison between Somalia and Sierra Leone. In bold arethe indicators on which Somalia outperforms Sierra Leone.2Table 10.1.

This includes lifeexpectancy, number of physicians, infants with low birth weight, infantmortality, maternal mortality, telephones, and extreme poverty. Anarchic Somaliaoutperforms Sierra Leone on 57 percent of the available indicators despite thefact that Sierra Leone receives nearly five times the amount of foreign aid thatSomalia does and has a smaller population (CIA World Factbook 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos803343]).Equally important, on fourteen of the eighteen development indicators that allowfor comparison within country over time, Somalia has improved. Although datalimitations only allow a similar across-time comparison for Sierra Leone oneight indicators, more than a third of that country's indicators show a declinesince the previous period, and the others show only minimal progress compared toSomalia. These data are only suggestive, of course. But they suggest that, likeSomalia, Sierra Leone might benefit from “going stateless.”Next, using data from Powell, Ford, and Nowrasteh (2008[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos838839]) that coverthirteen development indicators, I compare anarchic Somalia to forty-one otherSub-Saharan African countries, all of which have governments, and many, thoughnot all, of which are predatory. Consider Table 10.2, which ranks Somalia oneach indicator among its regional cohort.Table 10.2.

On three other indicators Somalia is in the toptwo-thirds of its cohort. On the remaining five – immunizations (DPT andmeasles), tuberculosis, infant mortality, and access to improved water sources –Somalia falls close to or at the very bottom. It's a checkered record, to besure. But it suggests that anarchic Somalia may be outperforming at least somecountries in Sub-Saharan Africa governed by predatory governments.More important, Somalia improved relative to a number of countries inSub-Saharan Africa since its government collapsed in 1991. Between 1990 –Somalia's last year under government – and 2005, Somalia improved its rankingrelative to the other Sub-Saharan African countries considered in Table 10.2 onfour of seven indicators that allow for comparison across time. These data mustagain be interpreted with caution. But they, too, suggest that at least someLDCs in Sub-Saharan Africa currently under predatory government may be able toprofit from going stateless as Somalia did.Would embracing anarchy be a welfare-enhancing move for LDCs on the brink ofgovernment collapse? Because of the international community's efforts aimed atpreventing these governments from doing so, we have only one country that,despite such efforts, has operated under statelessness for any significantperiod of time. Still, at a minimum, the data presented earlier suggest thatarguments for permitting state collapse and permitting anarchy to emerge in theleast-developed world deserve more than the usual chuckle or sneer.Harold Demsetz (1969[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos808407]) famouslycautioned social scientists to avoid committing the “nirvana fallacy,” whichcompares an imperfect reality with a hypothetical ideal state. Instead, hepointed out, we should compare the situation we confront with the relevantalternatives actually available to us. The plans for a path from here to theremust be grounded in an assessment of how things were, how they are, and how theyrealistically could be. His caution is especially useful when consideringreforms in the developing world and, as Coyne (2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos805714]) points out, forSomalia in particular.Policy makers shouldn't allow the best to be the enemy of the good – or, in thecase of LDCs that confront highly constrained governance opportunity sets, eventhe not so good. In Somalia, for example, a consideration of the relevantgovernance alternatives based on realistically assessing the country's past andpresent suggests that, in the near future at least, it's unlikely that a newcentral government, should the most recent attempt to reintroduce one provesuccessful, would resemble anything like a constrained, supportive state. Thehistory of Somalia's experience under government, as well as the ongoingexperiences of its regional cohort, implies less optimism than is oftenprojected by the advocates of recreating government in that country. Factionaldisagreements similar to those that led to civil war in the few years aftergovernment's collapse remain strong. Any ruler who established encompassingpower from one of these groups would likely turn the state's power against itsrivals rather than to the good of the country, much as Barre's regime did beforeit ended. The FGS, which, as the previous chapter noted, has limited domesticsupport, may lack more inclusive support precisely because of this and becausefaction leaders recognize the strong possibility that any one faction gainingtoo much power could mean the virtual annihilation of the others.The theory of second best as applied to governance alternatives in theleast-developed world suggests that if high-quality political governance isunattainable because of constraints that prevent rule-bound, non-predatorygovernment, deviating from the other conditions required for high-qualitygovernment – namely state power to provide law, enforcement, and public goods –may be required to achieve the second-best outcome, which is anarchy. This lineof reasoning does not suggest that any degree of political predation (i.e., theabsence of perfectly effective constraints on government) requires theabandonment of government. Not even the most successful developed countries,such as those in North America and Western Europe, satisfy this impossiblebenchmark. My discussion has focused on the total absence of constraints ongovernment and thus unchecked political predation, which we observe in thepoorest parts of the world. When this is the case, government may generate morecosts than benefits for its citizens, and the potential for anarchy's relativesuperiority reemerges. The task then becomes identifying for which specificcountries this potential is a reality.At least for the poorest of the LDCs, where government often hangs on only by anexternally funded thread, it seems that such a reality is plausible. For thesecountries, it may make more sense to welcome anarchy than to fear it. If, as mydiscussion suggests, predatory government is the worst-possible governancearrangement, the poorest of the LDCs are already at the bottom of the governancebarrel. Under anarchy, there's nowhere for welfare to go but up.* This essay is based on and uses material from Leeson, Peter T., and ClaudiaR.

First, individuals who are unable or unwilling torely on government to facilitate social cooperation find their own, oftensurprising ways to do so, even in situations where we might expect it least,such as where the discipline of continuous dealings alone is insufficient toproduce cooperation (Parts I[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_008.html#filepos43978]–III[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_014.html#filepos345761]). Second, in somecases at least, the mechanisms of self-governance those individuals develop forthis purpose may be capable of producing more social cooperation, and thus asuperior level of welfare, than their realistic government alternative couldproduce if it were relied on instead (Part IV[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_017.html#filepos515731]). Together thesethemes suggest that significantly more optimism about anarchy, and significantlymore pessimism about government, as governance alternatives is in order.In this concluding chapter I hope to underscore these themes by considering twoexamples of a class of self-governing mechanisms I have until now neglected:self-governing mechanisms rooted in superstition – that is, objectively falsebeliefs. Superstition-based mechanisms of self-governance are especially usefulfor emphasizing the dual themes pointed to earlier, for two reasons. First,their “exoticness” highlights the incredible ingenuity of persons in anarchy todevelop self-governing solutions to the problems of social cooperation theyconfront, and the incredible variety of self-governing manifestations thatingenuity can take, in particular when the discipline of continuous dealings byitself is of little or no avail.1 Second, while previous chapters discussed howself-governance can in some cases outperform its relevant governmentalternative, it should be especially surprising to most readers to findsuperstition-based self-governance doing so precisely because thisself-governance is grounded in what would appear to be the flimsiest offoundations: objectively false thinking. Suggesting, as I intend to do, thateven superstition-based self-governance can outperform its relevant governmentalternative should therefore supply particularly powerful evidence ofself-governance's potential to produce better outcomes than the state.God DamnSelf-governing mechanisms rooted in superstition often appear senseless andsocially chaotic, just as the anarchic environments they govern appear to be. Inactuality, however, these mechanisms are often sensible and conducive topromoting social order, just as their anarchic environments often are. Considerthe practice of cursing.A curse is an appeal to a supernatural power to physically, emotionally,spiritually, or otherwise bring harm to another person. By imposing expectedcosts on social rule breakers in the absence of government or traditionalself-governing mechanisms that could do the same, curses can incentivizewould-be rule breakers to respect social rules. As long as individuals reposesome positive level of belief in a curse's legitimacy, the threat of beingcursed can influence their behavior in desirable ways, just as the threat ofbeing incarcerated, ostracized, or executed under government or traditionalmechanism of self-governance can.For centuries communities of monks in medieval West Francia – the territoryencompassing most of modern-day France – leveraged this cursing logic to protecttheir property rights against violent theft. Monks called their cursesmaledictions.2 “Maledictions were part of the stock-in-trade of monastic defenseprograms” (Rosenwein, Head, and Farmer 1991[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos842429]: 771). Indeed, itwasn't only monastic communities that used maledictions to defend property.Other communities of clerics, such as canons, did too.3Contrary to contemporary images of monks and canons, which see these churchmenas paupers, medieval communities of monks and canons in West Francia werewealthy (see, for instance, Geary 1991[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos814178]: 20). Their mostvaluable possessions were their vast land holdings and the appurtenances thatcame with them. In much of West Francia, communities of clerics were the largestlandowners in the kingdom (see, for instance, Little 1993[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos828551]: 208).Between the tenth and twelfth centuries these communities’ significant wealthconfronted great insecurity. Under the Carolingian dynasty, a system of royaljustice – king-appointed counts and, failing them, the king himself – protectedmonks’ and canons’ property rights.4 But beginning with the reign of the lastCarolingian king, Louis the Pious, that system began to degrade.Aided by the Viking incursions in the ninth century, which did much to disruptthe previous pattern of governance, in the tenth century the Carolingian systemof royal justice broke down. First, comital authority became hereditary insteadof dependent on royal discretion. This rendered counts largely independent ofthe central government's control. Not long after, counts lost their publicauthority too. Local strongmen fortified in castles, or “castellans,” replacedindependent counts as the basic unit of governance. The result was a system ofpetty fiefdoms headed by strongmen accountable to no one but strongmen strongerthan them-selves.5This situation might not have been dire for clerical communities if they had thephysical strength – the military means – of self-protection. But most didn't. A“monastery did not directly command the physical or military means to defend itsown properties” (Little 1993[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos828551]: 53). Monks andcanons surrendered arms, horses, and other means of self-protection when theygave up their lives as laypersons and took up the cloth.6 Their communities’extensive properties were like sitting ducks for unscrupulous secular strongmenwho, as a group, enjoyed a monopoly on the means of physical coercion.This situation has been dubbed feudal anarchy. Many medieval scholars now eschewthis term. But it provides a good sense of the decrepit state that publicinstitutions of property protection were in between the tenth and twelfthcenturies in the equivalent of modern-day France.It was in this context that clerical communities began to rely on maledictions –divine curses – to improve their property protection. Monks and canons usedseveral kinds of maledictions to deal with persons who threatened their propertyrights. Historian Lester Little (1993[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos828551]) has translatedand compiled many of these curses. In what follows I draw from his work toillustrate their forms.The first kind of malediction monks and canons used to improve their propertyprotection against castellan plunder was the liturgical maledictio. Liturgicalbenedictions are divine blessings following prescribed forms that clerics bestowon persons they want to venerate at times of community worship, such as mass.7Benedictionals are the books containing clerical formulas for these blessings.Medieval clerics had no “maledictionals.” But they did have liturgicalmaledictions: divine curses following prescribed forms that they leveled atpersons they wanted to damn at times of community worship. Consider thefollowing malediction formula from the Abbey of Féfchamp circa the late tenthcentury (Little 1993[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos828551]: 9):> [W]e curse them and we separate them from the company of the holy mother> church and of all faithful Christians, unless they change their ways and give> back what they unjustly took away.…May they be cursed in the head and the> brain. May they be cursed in their eyes and their foreheads. May they be> cursed in their ears and their noses. May they be cursed in fields and in> pastures.…May they be cursed when sleeping and when awake, when going out and> returning, when eating and drinking, when speaking and being silent. May they> be cursed in all places at all times.The second kind of malediction clerics used to improve their property protectionwas called a clamor. Clamors weren't technically curses. But clerics could usethem to invoke curse-like effects and sometimes did so in tandem with propermaledictions.To clamor is to make a vigorous appeal. That's precisely what monks and canonsdid when they used clamors to curse. Clamoring clerics appealed to God and otherholy figures, such as apostles, confessors, and, most frequently, saints.Clerical communities were officially the property of the saints in whose namethey were established. According to popular belief, it was those saints’ duty toprotect their communities. Thus, when monks’ or canons’ property rights cameunder attack, it was only natural for them to clamor their patron saints tothwart their oppressors.8Sometimes clamors were simply public supplications to saints or other holyfigures for this purpose. Other times they were more severe. In these casesclerics didn't just supplicate their supernatural overseers. They publiclyhumiliated them.Clerics humiliated holy figures by moving those figures’ remains (relics) orrelated corporeal extensions (crucifixes and holy texts) from their traditionalplaces of exaltation to the ground. There, clerics covered them with brush orthorns. Similarly, clamoring clerics sometimes humiliated themselves – God'sservants – by lying prostrate on the floor.Clerics’ logic was that humiliating holy figures (or themselves) would, in theeyes of their plunderers, provoke those figures, who expected to be veneratedrather than denigrated. So provoked, supernatural overseers would turn theirdispleasure on the plunderers prompting clerics’ rude call.9The third kind of malediction medieval clerical communities used to improvetheir property protection is the most familiar: excommunication and anathema.10Excommunication and anathema were predominantly the province of popes andbishops. But sometimes these higher-ranking ecclesiastics “licensed” lower-levelclerics to excommunicate and anathematize the violators of Church property too.Excommunication came in varying degrees that ranged from cutting one off fromthe sacraments to cutting him off from all members of the Holy Mother Church.Anathema was a kind of excommunication with gusto. It was a more dramaticexcommunication reserved for contumacious excommunicates that often involved aceremony of snuffing out candles or stomping them on the floor to symbolize theanathema's effect on the target's soul.Clerics weren't averse to throwing in some curses against majorexcommunicates/anathematized persons when excommunicating or anathematizing themeither, although this was not properly an excommunication – especially whentheir property was threatened. In these cases the lines between excommunicationand malediction became blurred. Excommunication and anathema became a kind ofmalediction. Consider the following excommunication Pope Benedict VIII launchedagainst some persons violating the property rights of the Abbey of Saint-Gillesin 1014 (Little 1993[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos828551]: 43):> May they be cursed in the East, disinherited in the West, interdicted in the> North, and excommunicated in the South. May they be cursed in the day and> excommunicated at night. May they be cursed at home and excommunicated while> away, cursed in standing and excommunicated in sitting.…May they be cursed in> the spring and excommunicated in the summer, cursed in the autumn and> excommunicated in the winter.The final form of malediction clerics used to improve their property protectionisn't so much a different kind of malediction as it is a different use for it:contract cursing.11 Besides imprecating strongmen who sought to violently seizetheir land and possessions, clerics threatened to imprecate persons who violatedtheir land contracts.A common way that clerical communities came to possess property was for laybenefactors to gift it to them. A not infrequent occurrence was that some personmight give land to, say, a monastic community, only to have his lord, his lord'sheirs, or his own heirs challenge the community's property right to that land inthe future. In an attempt to prevent this, a gifting layperson's lord, heirs, orboth were often asked to make their consent to the gift explicit. Their consentwas then recorded in a charter remembering the gift and held by the receivingclerics.12To strengthen the enforcement of these persons’ promises, clerics commonlyincluded “curse clauses” in their charters.13 These clauses, witnessed andconsented to by the charter counterparties, threatened to imprecate them if inthe future they tried to violate the Church's charter-identified propertyrights. Consider the following “curse clause” from a twelfth-century charterrecording a land grant from a layperson to the Church (Little 1993[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos828551]: 56):> And if any wish to destroy this charter…[m]ay they have the curses of the> three patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and of the four evangelists, Mark> and Matthew, Luke and John; and of the twelve apostles and of the sixteen> prophets and of the twenty- four elders and of the 318 holy fathers who> deliberated on the canons at Nicea; and may they have the curse of the 144,000> martyrs who died for the Lord; and may they have the curse of the cherubim and> the seraphim, who hold the throne of God, and of all the saints of God.Excluding the entire army of saints, which was undoubtedly large, this charterinvokes the curses of no fewer than 144,380 people to be brought down upon thehead of anyone who might try to violate it. That's a lot of curses.Quantitative data that could shed light on the extent to which maledictionspermitted clerics to improve their communities’ property protection don't exist.However, narrative sources suggest that maledictions were often effective inthis purpose. The fact that clerical communities used maledictions to defendtheir property for three centuries suggests that they must have been at leastsomewhat effective too. Commenting on the invocation of saintly interventions inparticular, one historian of the Middle Ages notes that, “[i]n general, theyseemed to have worked quite well, or at least better than anything elseavailable” for the protection of clerical communities’ property (Geary 1991[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos814178]: 20).Crucially, malediction as a mechanism of self-governance worked because of, notin spite of, medieval superstition: the objectively false belief according towhich clerics could call on God to supernaturally punish persons who attackedthe Church. That superstition had its foundation in a centrally important bookthat reflected medieval Christian belief – the Bible.14Like medieval clerics themselves, the Bible is a curious mix of brotherly loveand frightful wrath. It contains numerous curses. Consider this small samplingfrom Deuteronomy 28:> [I]f you do not obey the Lord your God and do not carefully follow all his> commands and decrees I am giving you today, all these curses will come on you> and overtake you:> You will be cursed in the city and cursed in the country.…> You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out.…> The Lord will plague you with diseases until he has destroyed you from the> land you are entering to possess. The Lord will strike you with wasting> disease, with fever and inflammation, with scorching heat and drought, with> blight and mildew, which will plague you until you perish. The sky over your> head will be bronze, the ground beneath you iron.…> You will be pledged to be married to a woman, but another will take her and> rape her. You will build a house, but you will not live in it. You will plant> a vineyard, but you will not even begin to enjoy its fruit. Your ox will be> slaughtered before your eyes, but you will eat none of it.…The Lord will> afflict your knees and legs with painful boils that cannot be cured, spreading> from the soles of your feet to the top of your head.…> All these curses will come on you.15These curses should sound familiar. They're the same ones that graced liturgicalmaledictions, clamors, excommunications, and charters. Compare the curseselaborated in Deuteronomy 28 with the following liturgical malediction from theAbbey of Saint-Martial of Limoges circa the late tenth century (Little 1993[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos828551]: 60–61):> We hereby inform you, brothers, that certain evil men are devastating the land> of our lord Martial.…May the curse of all the saints of God come upon> them.…May they be cursed in town. May they be cursed in the fields. May they> be cursed inside their houses and outside their houses.…May their wives and> their children and all who associate with them be cursed.…May their vineyards> and their crops and their forests be cursed.…May the Lord send over them> hunger and thirst, pestilence and death, until they are wiped off the> earth.…May the sky above them be brass and the earth they walk on iron.…May> the Lord strike them from the bottoms of their feet to the tops of their> heads.To render malediction an effective weapons against plunderers, clerics needed toground their curses firmly in plunderers’ existing beliefs. Because targets wereChristians, grounding maledictions in “biblical curse traditions” achievedprecisely that (Geary 1995[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos814355]: 96).16Notably, the superstition-based mechanism of self-governance reflected inclerical cursing served to overcome a problem faced by persons in anarchy that,as the essays in Part II[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_011.html#filepos182009] discussed, thediscipline of continuous dealings has difficulty overcoming: the problem ofviolent theft. While in many cases magical thinking won't be an effectivesafeguard against plunder, in contexts in which the “belief framework” requiredto support magical thinking's effectiveness in this regard exists, as it did inthe context medieval monks and canons confronted, superstition can be effective.It constitutes another arrow in the self-governance quiver that individuals canand do use to promote social order under anarchy.SassywoodLeveraging objectively false beliefs to secure private law and order goes farbeyond cursing monks. There are many superstition-based mechanisms ofself-governance that individuals use when they can't, or prefer not to, rely ongovernment for this purpose. The judicial ordeals known as sassywood, used incontemporary Liberia, are a case in point.Judicial ordeals have a long and rich history the world over. Most famously,trial by boiling water and burning iron was used by medieval European legalsystems to determine persons’ guilt or innocence in difficult criminal cases forhundreds of years leading up to the emergence of jury trial in England and theinquisitorial procedure on the continent in the thirteenth century.17Judicial ordeals remain popular in contemporary Liberia because that country'sgovernment-supplied legal institutions are dysfunctional, where they exist atall. The state-provided judicial system is inaccessible to many Liberians, rifewith corruption, and typically administrated by persons ignorant of the law,legal procedure, and without the resources required to perform basic judicialservices adequately. In the face of this government failure, rural Liberians inparticular, who constitute more than half of the country's population and facede facto “judicial anarchy,” use private mechanisms – among them sassywood – toadminister criminal justice instead.Today people use the term “sassywood” to describe a variety of judicial ordealsthat play a prominent role in the customary criminal justice systems ofLiberians, the inhabitants of Sierra Leone, and smaller numbers of peopleelsewhere in Africa.18 However, the sassywood ordeal, which I focus on, takesits name from the poison concoction these systems ask criminal defendants todrink to determine their guilt or innocence. The poisonous part of thatconcoction is made from the toxic bark of the Erythrophleum suaveolens, orsasswood tree.19Sassywood is a “method of invoking the aid of supernatural powers to settledisputes or to test the truth of accusation” to adjudge the accused's guilt orinnocence (Kirk-Greene 1955[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos822590]: 44).20Sassywood's particulars vary across time and place.21 But its basics aresimilar. A criminal defendant imbibes a poisonous concoction, sometimes called“red water” (Wilson 1856[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos856012]: 225):> [T]he people who assembled to see [the sassywood] administered form themselves> into a circle, and the pots containing the liquid are placed in the center of> the enclosed place. The accused comes forward…his accusation is announced, he> makes a formal acknowledgement of all of the evil deeds of his past life, then> invokes the name of God three times, and imprecates his wrath in case he is> guilty of the particular crime.…He then steps forward and drinks freely of the> red water.22The defendants’ physiological reaction to his consumption of the sassywoodconcoction decides his guilt or innocence (Afzerlius 1967[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos791237]: 25):23> If the drinker by vomiting throws up all the [poison]…before the sunrise the> following morning or much more if he does it during the very trial then he is> innocent and publicly declared not guilty of the crime for which he was> accused. But if he should die on the spot [or display signs of> intoxication]…then he is believed and proclaimed Guilty.24Historically, like its medieval predecessor, sassywood has typically beenreserved for important crimes, such as theft or murder (Davies 1973[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos807766]: 44).25 Also likeits medieval predecessor, sassywood is reserved for difficult cases – cases inwhich “ordinary” evidence is inconclusive or lacking and thus traditional meansof fact finding have failed. Accused criminals are charged publicly with a crimebefore their entire community. They can respond to the charge against them byconfessing their guilt or proclaiming their innocence. In the latter casethey're asked to undergo sassywood.The logic behind sassywood's ostensible power to determine accused criminals’guilt or innocence lies in a widely held Liberian superstition according towhich a spirit, or witch, “accompanies the draught, and searches the heart ofthe suspected individual for his guilt. If he be innocent, the spirit returnswith the fluid in the act of ejection, but if guilty, it remains to do moresurely the work of destruction” (Hening 1850[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos818391]: 45; see alsoTonkin 2000 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos849773]:368).The fact-finding spirit inhabits the draught via the bark of the sasswood tree.Consider how one man tasked with collecting sasswood bark to make the sassywoodconcoction addressed the tree from which he harvested the poisonous exterior:“You are a tree that never lies, a tree full of power. You give justice to allalike. If you agree that if it is true that the accused…is guilty of causing thedeath of deceased…show it to us when the cutlass touches your body” (Harley 1970[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos817142]: 156).A “sassywood specialist” administers the ordeal en toto and acts as the trial'sjudge. He mixes the sassywood concoction and oversees the ordeal or choosessomeone else to do so. The specialist's identity varies. But he's always aspiritual “leader” – an individual the community members seeking his assistancesee as wielding special spiritual power that gives him authority to performsocioreligious rituals. Such individuals may include “witch doctors” –specialists in “medicines,” poisons, and witchcraft – “zoes,” or secret societyleaders, elders with special standing in their communities, and chiefs.Regardless of sassywood specialists’ particular identities, “only the men whoknow medicine, especially sasswood medicine, well and themselves possess strongmedicine can conduct the ordeals” (Davies 1973[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos807766]: 43).What seems like a senseless judicial procedure is in reality an ingenious,private judicial procedure for finding fact. The key to understanding how thisis so is to recall the superstition that underlies sassywood – the superstitionaccording to which a magical spirit that inhabits the sassywood concoction caninfallibly detect a person's guilt or innocence, and acts on him accordingly towhat it has found. Given this belief, persons confronted with the specter ofimbibing deadly poison who are guilty of the crime of which they stand accusedexpect sassywood to reveal their guilt and kill them, or at least to inflictserious pain on them, in the process. In contrast, innocent persons expect toexpel the sassywood potion, evidencing their innocence and leaving themunharmed.Because confessing to his crime and suffering the resulting community-stipulatedpunishment for his misdeed is less costly for a guilty defendant than death (orat least severe pain) and suffering the community-stipulated punishment whensassywood reveals his guilt, the guilty criminal defendant prefers to confess tohis crime rather than to undergo sassywood. Because being unharmed andexonerated by sassywood is less costly for an innocent defendant than confessingto a crime he hasn't committed and thus suffering the community-stipulatedpunishment for that crime, the innocent criminal defendant prefers to undergosassywood rather than to confess. Indeed, because innocent defendants expect tobe unharmed and exonerated by undergoing sassywood, they may request to besubjected to the ordeal to evidence their innocence. This explains why, ratherthan universally expressing fear at the specter of undergoing trial by ordeal,some Liberians volunteer to do so (Isser, Lubkemann, and N’Tow 2009[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos820916]: 58).Because of the sassywood superstition, the ordeal imposes different expectedcosts on innocent and guilty defendants. This leads innocent and guiltydefendants to choose differently when confronted with the specter of undergoingthe ordeal. Innocent persons’ expected cost of undergoing sassywood is lowerthan guilty persons’ expected cost of doing so. Thus innocent persons are morelikely to opt to undergo it.26 Because of this, sassywood specialists – informalLiberian judicial administrators – learn important information about criminaldefendants’ guilt or innocence by observing how defendants choose whenconfronted with the specter of undergoing sassywood. Having learned thedefendant's likely criminal status, the sassywood specialist rigs the ordeal tofind the correct result, securing genuine criminal justice. Because innocentdefendants are the ones who are most likely to choose to undergo sassywood, thismeans manipulating the potion such that it exonerates the accused.“[F]ar from being the infallible and just ‘judge’ that the people as a wholeth[ink] it to be, the sasswood ordeal offer[s] several opportunities fortrickery and manipulation” (Harley 1970[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos817142]: 158).Specialists can manipulate the sassywood concoction to ensure that the “poison”criminal defendants drink isn't poisonous at all or at least that its presencein the concoction is low enough to prevent deleterious effects. Alternatively,specialists can include ingredients in the sassywood potion that inducevomiting, leading the defendant to expel the sasswood toxin (Harley 1970[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos817142]: 159). In theseand doubtless other ways, sassywood specialists “can so arrange these tests asto make them produce any result they wish. By weakening or strengthening thedecoction of sassy-wood, they can make it innocent or fatal, as interest orinclination may lead” (Hale 1853[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos816846]: 234).27Sassywood specialists’ “trade secrets” of ordeal manipulation are kept secret byvirtue of their monopoly on making and administering the sassywood mix. Recallthat these specialists are spiritual leaders who allegedly have access tosupernatural forces only they can wield. The importance of sustaining Liberians’superstition – their belief that trial by poison ingestion is supernaturallycapable of revealing criminal defendants’ guilt or innocence – helps explain whyonly certain, sanctified persons are permitted to administer sassywood asjudicial administrators and helps ensure that only persons knowledgeable aboutand skilled in the manipulation of sassywood conduct ordeal trials.The result of the sassywood procedure is a self-confirming equilibrium. Theguilty defendant declines the ordeal, so his belief is never undermined. Theinnocent defendant undergoes the ordeal, but because the sassywood administratorrigs the ordeal to reflect his innocence, the ordeal exonerates him. Thus theinnocent defendant's belief is confirmed. Sassywood reinforces the very beliefthat makes it effective. Moreover, it finds fact correctly and, similar to thecase of the cursing monks, it does so because of, not in spite of, Liberians’superstition.In practice sassywood fact-finding is more complicated that what I havedescribed in this section. In large part this is because, in practice, potentialcriminal defendants may be skeptical in varying degrees of the superstition thatunderlies the ordeal. Still, the logic I sketched provides a basic sense of howthis self-governing mechanism works: by leveraging the objectively false beliefthat underlies it, sassywood accurately “sorts” guilty and innocent defendants,revealing their criminal status where it would otherwise remain hidden. Mostimportant, sassywood supplies evidence that even self-governing mechanisms thathave objectively false beliefs as their basis are capable of outperforming theirrelevant governmental alternative – not, in the case of sassywood, because thosemechanisms are free from problems, but rather because those mechanisms, whichseem absurd on the surface, often work much better than their absurd façadewould suggest, and most critically of all, because their relevant governmentalalternative – corrupt and dysfunctional state courts – are riddled with stillmore severe problems.Going ForwardThe dual themes identified at the beginning of this chapter and highlighted bythe superstition-based self-governing mechanisms discussed in the precedingsections point to a path forward for future considerations of anarchy. Theysuggest two “principles” or “rules of thumb” it would be wise to bear in mindfor future thinking about self-governance.First, persons in anarchy who must find private solutions to the obstacles thatstand in the way of their ability to realize the gains from social cooperationare better at finding such solutions than you are. Thus the fact that you (orother researchers) haven't thought of a self-governing mechanism that canovercome some problem that anarchy presents doesn't imply that self-governanceis unable to do so. The odds that you have failed are higher than the odds thatanarchy has.This book has focused on self-governance where the state is absent ordysfunctional. But anarchy, and thus self-governance, is ubiquitous. You canfind it nearly everywhere if you know how to look. Hopefully, this book hasimproved your ability to find successful self-governance across time and space.For example, even where highly functioning government is present, the state'seye can't be everywhere all the time and, even when it is, the state may be tooslow to respond or be too expensive to use. The result is “pockets” of effectiveanarchy amid even “good” government. Thus we find “rent-a-cops,” privatearbitration, and reliance on superstition to produce contractual compliance evenamong law-abiding citizens in countries such as the United States (see, forinstance, Benson 1998[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos798066]; Richman 2006[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos841452]).28 Here citizenshave a choice among governance alternatives. And they sometimes choose to useself-governing mechanisms to facilitate social cooperation instead ofgovernment.This observation leads to the second “principle” for future thinking aboutanarchy that this book's dual themes point to. Upon observing a mechanism ofself-governance that “obviously” underperforms its actual governmentalalternative, ask yourself why, if this is so, the persons who rely on it do so.You may find that on closer inspection, a poorly performing anarchic arrangementis in fact underperformed still further by an even more poorly performinggovernment.Anarchy, in other words, may work better than you think.* This chapter is based on and uses material from Leeson, Peter T. 2014. “GodDamn: The Law and Economics of Monastic Malediction.” Journal of Law, Economics,and Organization, XXXX [© 2014 Oxford University Press] and Leeson, Peter T.,and Christopher J. Coyne. 2012. “Sassywood.” Journal of Comparative Economics,40(4): 608–620 [© 2012 Association for Comparative Economic Studies. Publishedby Elsevier Inc.]. 1 For additional examples of superstition-based mechanisms of self-governancebesides those considered here, see Leeson (2012[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos826342]b, 2013[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos826895]). 2 This chapter abuses the term “malediction” in the sense that it considersvarious forms of clerical cursing under this title. In fact, as I discuss laterin the chapter, “malediction” technically refers to a specific kind of clericalcurse, the liturgical malediction, rather than to the variety of clericalcurse-type forms I consider. Because my analysis deals with clerical curses, Iuse the term “malediction” to encompass all these forms and to distinguish themfrom other kinds of curses one can envisage, which aren't the province ofecclesiastics. 3 Maledictions weren't the only method to which communities of monks and canonsresorted to improve their property protection. But they were a major one. For adiscussion of some of their other methods, see Rosenwein, Head, and Farmer (1991[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos842429]). 4 This wasn't from benevolence. The Church provided important benefits to royalgovernment. The Church could curse or otherwise use its relationship to thedivine to delegitimize secular rulers. Conversely, it could bless or otherwiselend divine legitimacy to secular rulers. In return for the Church's support,secular rulers supported Church property rights. 5 The degraded state of public law and order in the equivalent of modern-dayFrance in the tenth through twelfth centuries has been discussed at length byhistorians of the Middle Ages. See, for instance, Duby (1977[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos810000]), Dunbabin (1985[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos810143]), Bisson (1994[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos799144]), and Geary (1995[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos814355]). However, thebreakdown of public law and order should not be taken to imply that no courts atall functioned, for example. At the level of individual landholders, privatecourts with some semblance of authority often did exist. The problem was thatcourts with the formal authority to adjudicate and enforce decisions regardingdisputes between persons from different lords did not. The years followingCarolingian justice's breakdown were not anarchic in the sense of lacking allgovernance. Indeed, as the case of cursing this chapter considers suggests,private governance did exist. Rather, these years were anarchic in the sensethat widespread public justice was lacking. During these years malediction wasan important source of Church property protection. 6 This was in keeping with the monastic principle of the “renunciation of…themeans and symbols of earthly power” (Little 1993[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos828551]: 51). When publicinstitutions were well functioning, monks’ and canons’ expectation was thatgovernment would protect them. When those institutions eroded, their expectationwas to rely on alternative mechanisms for this purpose, such as the ones thisessay describes. 7 Ecclesiastics used negative and positive spiritual incentives to secure theirends. Just as persons who trammeled Church property could be cursed, persons whocontributed to Church property could be blessed. 8 Technically, clamoring clerics clamored only God directly. Other holyfigures, such as humiliated saints, clamored God on clerics’ behalf togetherwith clerics. However, it could be God's wrath or saints’ (or both) thatoffending persons, who prompted the clamor, were supposed to fear because of theritual. 9 Persons who prompted clerical clamors weren't only supposed to fear divinewrath for their offenses. They were supposed to face pressure from neighbors,family members, and economic partners to change their ways and make restitutionfor their offense. This role is common to all forms of malediction this chapterdiscusses and constitutes an additional, supportive element of curses’ power toimprove property protection. There's no way to empirically distinguish or weighthe separate contributions of maledictions’ supernatural versus shamingelements. But it's clear that their supernatural element was expected to do someof the work. For example, contract curses, discussed later, could be private.Clerics and their contractual counterparties witnessed and thus knew aboutthese. Thus, if a counterparty violated his agreement, he would know he wascursed. But others may not know, precluding public shaming. In such cases thecurse's expected effect operated solely through its supernatural element. 10 On excommunication in the Middle Ages, see Vodola (1986[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos854711]). 11 Besides Little (1993[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos828551]), see alsoTabuteau (1988 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos848987]). 12 On the problems that consent rules created in Norman England and thepeculiar legal system to which they gave rise, see Leeson (2011[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos826200]). 13 Some charters involving Church property seem to have involved laypersonspraying for curses to fall on contract violators. Presumably such persons onlydid so with churchman permission/approval or under churchman authority, giventhat only churchmen were seen as wielding the power to divinely curse. 14 A strongman who believes in the Bible, and thus biblical prohibitions ontheft, may still be willing to appropriate Church property. For example, he maysee himself as reclaiming property that's legitimately his rather than stealing,or for some other reason view his seizure as justified in God's eyes. Astrongman who sees his appropriation as theft may be willing to steal becausethe discounted cost of the punishment he expects God to mete out to him when hedies is lower than the present benefit he expects to enjoy from the stolenproperty. In both cases malediction adds to the expected cost of appropriationand shifts much of that cost to the present, reducing the likelihood thestrongman will take from the Church. 15 The Book of Psalms is another hotbed of biblical cursing. See, for instance,Psalms 35:6; 35:8; 55:15; 69:22; 69:23; 69:25; 69:28; 83:17; 109:8; 109:9;109:10; 199:11; 109:12; 109:13; and 140:10. On Psalm maledictions, see Curraoin(1963 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos807002]). 16 Because maledictions’ effectiveness depended on persons’ belief in them,predators may have had an incentive to develop disbelief in clerical curses inparticular and the Bible/Christianity more generally. I have found no evidencethat they tried to do so. This isn't to say that self-delusion isn't possible ornever occurred. However, it may reflect the fact that deliberately changingone's religious beliefs is difficult. A Christian who desires to drop hisreligious beliefs confronts a time-inconsistency problem. At the time heconsiders doing so, he believes that in the future, when his belief is gone, hewill be damned as a consequence. To be willing to deliberately jettison one'sbelief in Christianity today, one must already significantly disbelieve inChristianity, and thus the consequences of rejecting it. 17 On the law and economics of medieval judicial ordeals, see Leeson (2012[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos826342]c). 18 For example, defendants are sometimes asked to place their hand in a pot ofboiling oil in a manner similar to the medieval hot water ordeal. Alternatively,defendants may have a heated machete applied to their skin, similar to themedieval hot iron ordeal. 19 The sasswood tree is also called Erythrophleum guineense. 20 Kirk-Green's characterization here is made specifically in the context ofNigerian sassywood. But his characterization applies equally to Liberiansassywood. 21 For example, in Eastern and Western Africa, citizens sometimes used animalsas proxies for defendants in imbibing the poisonous mixture (Davies 1973[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos807766]: 33). However, inLiberia, the defendants themselves imbibe the poisonous concoction. 22 Sassywood may also be used to determine the veracity or falsity of awitness's testimony. 23 This description refers to sassywood in Sierra Leone but also characterizesthe basics of sassywood in Liberia. 24 According to Wilson (1856[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos856012]: 225), forexample, if imbibing the concoction “causes vertigo and [the accused] losesself-control, it is [also] regarded as evidence of guilt.” 25 Accusations of witchcraft – of the use of supernatural means to perpetratethese or similar crimes – are also often adjudicated via sassywood. Suchaccusations are typically leveled when some crime or socially undesirable eventhas occurred but the culprit remains mysterious. This is consistent with theidea that sassywood is used to find fact about a criminal's identity when“ordinary” evidence to that effect is unavailable. 26 As noted earlier, sassywood is far from the only judicial ordeal on whichLiberians have historically relied. A common, nonlethal variant called cowfur isa kind of glorified oath taking. A criminal defendant or other person whosejudicial testimony is in question may be asked to “swallow his oath” byconsuming a clod of dirt or some other harmless substance. The logic here isthat if the person is guilty (or lying), spiritual forces inhabiting orresulting from the oath will punish him. In some cases when even a suspect islacking for some crime, an entire community may be asked to swallow their oaths.The economic mechanism underlying these variants of the judicial ordeal is thesame basic one described in this essay. Believers who are innocent have nothingto fear by swallowing their oaths and therefore are happy to do so. Believerswho are guilty fear the consequences of swallowing their oaths and thereforedecline to do so, revealing their guilt. 27 My theory of sassywood is consistent with cynical specialists and genuinelybelieving ones. A genuinely believing specialist may manipulate the poisonousconcoction in a manner similar to the way that a believer in the occultmanipulates the marker on a Ouija board. He may believe that “spirits” areguiding his actions or have some other internal justification that reconcileshis intervention with the ordeal's supernatural mechanics (see, for instance,Evans-Pritchard 1937[Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos810683]). Whether this isthe case or instead sassywood specialists are cynics is a question requiringempirical investigation. However, for mechanism described to “work,” all that'sneeded is for the sassywood specialist to observe the defendant's decision toundergo the ordeal and, on the basis of that decision, to manipulate theordeal's outcome to exonerate him – wittingly or unwittingly. 28 On extralegal contractual relations among Jewish diamond traders, see alsoBernstein (1992 [Anarchy_Unbound__Why_Self-Gover_split_022.html#filepos798635])."},{"pageContent":"ReferencesAfrica Watch Committee. 1990.
