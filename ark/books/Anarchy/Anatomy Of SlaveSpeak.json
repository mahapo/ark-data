He questioned a ll aspects of r elig ion and politics, particular ly in his book A Tale of a Tub . Swift's be st-known classic Gulliver's Tr avels is much more than a children' s book; it's an a dvance d political analy sis. L ewis Carr oll, author of Alice in W onderland , was a mathematician a nd philosopher -- a nd political analy st. The two ' Alice- books' can be reg arde d in part as political tra cts disguise d as childre n' s books. This repor t is an essential aid to under standing the \" Spooner-insig ht\" - - see The Constit ution of No Authori ty by L y sander Spooner. \"My name is Alice , so please y our Majesty ,\" sa id Alice ver y politely ; but she added to he rself, \" Why , they ' re only a pac k of ca rds, af ter a ll.

Hy att. Ph.D.) The fir st thing I want y ou to rea liz e is that the primar y tool or WEAPON terrocr ats use to subjuga te, control, a nd dominate their victims is W ORDS. By \"te rroc rat\" I mean \"c oerc ive political ag ent\" or \" terror ist bureauc rat.\" A terr ocra t is alway s an individual human being . Please think about this issue. How often ha s a terr ocra t stuck a g un in y our fa ce a nd said, \"Pay y our taxes or else? \" Compar e this to the number of times ter rocr ats have sent y ou piece s of pape r with words on them, telling y ou what to do or wha t not to do -- and wha t penalties y ou may be subjec ted to, if y ou don' t obey ? Now, plea se stretc h y our imag ination and imag ine a wor ld in which nobody takes the words of te rroc rats ser iously . They say , \"We a re the g overnme nt,\" a nd ever y one laug hs at"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"them and asks, \" Gover nment? -- wha t's tha t? \" A nd, whateve r they reply , they are g ree ted with more laug hter. Then they say , \"O ur word is law ; and y ou must obey .\" E very one just laug hs at the terroc rats and a sks, \"L aw? -- wha t's tha t? \" A g ain, whate ver the y reply , they are g ree ted with more laug hter. How much powe r would terr ocra ts have in such a world? I don' t car e how much thoug ht y ou have to put into this, but i t's a bsolutely vital that y ou understand tha t the primary means ter rocr ats use to subjug ate, c ontrol, and dominate their victims is words. Actually , there are three kinds of \"thing s\" te rroc rats use to c ontrol their victims. The first is violence. The second is money . And the third is words. B y violence, he re, I mean actua l phy sical violence . (Thre ats of violence are almost alway s expressed in words.) How ofte n has a te rroc rat used a ctual violence to control y ou? Were y ou phy sically drag g ed into school, or we re y ou coer ced by words to g o to school? Has a ny terroc rat ever used ac tual phy sical violence to make y ou pay taxes, or were y ou coer ced by words to pay up? Have y ou ever been a rre sted? I f so, in what propor tion did the cop use ac tual phy sical violence c ompare d to words. Did he tell y ou to put y our hands be hind y our bac k, or did he for ce y our hands be hind y our bac k without say ing a ny thing? Notice that e ven during most arre sts, cops use more w ords than ac tual phy sical violence to control their victims. Have y ou ever been to c ourt? To what propor tion do the terroc rats and la wy ers use words in court compa red to a ctual phy sical violence ? Have y ou ever been to jail? To what propor tion do the terroc rats use w ords in jail compar ed to ac tual phy sical violence ? How much powe r would terr ocra ts have in a w orld in which eve ry one say s \"N O!\" to them and laug hs at whate ver the y say ? Can y ou beg in to apprec iate that the powe r of terroc rats depe nds larg ely on victims acce pting ter rocr at words a nd obey ing the m? What about money ? To what e x tent do terroc rats use mone y to subjuga te, control, a nd dominate their victims? Well, they say their \" law\" (words) is that y ou must use their money ; y ou' re not a llowed to print y our own. And doe sn' t their money larg ely consist of piece s of pape r with words (a nd a fe w picture s) on them? I n the abse nce of words, could terroc rats use mone y to control people? And don' t their \" leg al tender laws\" consist entirely of words? I n their book Powershift the Toff lers indicate how power has prog ressively shifted first from those who c ommand violence to those w ho command money , and sec ond to those who command infor mation. And doesn' t information consist mostl y of words?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"What I want y ou to ge t, to gr asp, to understa nd is that the power of terroc rats depe nds more on wor ds than on any thing e lse. Of c ourse, their words have to be ac cepte d, believed, a nd obey ed by the vast majority of victims. But wha t would happen if a critica l mass of enlig htened, e mancipate d former victims were to r ejec t terroc rat wor ds, were to stop believing them, wer e to attac k and ridicule them whene ver a ppropriate , and we re to car efully and judiciously stop obey ing the m? Some of the idea s in this report may be thre atening to y our cur rent knowle dg e. I n his classic book Nineteen-E ighty-Four , Geor g e Or well coined te rms like \"thoug htcrime\" and \"c rimestop.\" I f y our cur rent knowle dg e is \" leg al,\" then some of the ide as pre sented he re are \"thoug htcrimes.\" Fr om the terroc rat pe rspec tive, attacking and ridiculing their words is no doubt a thoughtc rime. Your mind may find it difficult to deal with some of these ideas. Or well wrote : \" Crimestop means the f aculty of stopping shor t, as thoug h by instinct, at the threshold of a ny dang erous thoug ht. I t includes the powe r of not g rasping analog ies, of fa iling to per ceive logic al er rors, of misunder standing the simplest arg uments if they are inimical to [ an \" authority \"], and of be ing bor ed or r epelled by any train of thoug ht which is capa ble of lea ding in a here tical direc tion. Crimestop , in short, means protec tive stupidit y .\" So, please don' t let crimestop stop y ou! Benefits of Understandin g Slavespeak Once y ou understand political Slavespe ak (the lang uag e used to e stablish and maintain master- slave re lationships), y ou become very awa re of how those who don' t understand Slavespea k can be dominated, subjug ated, a nd controlled by words -- essentially enslave d by words. Corre spondingly , y ou become impervious to ext erna l control throug h words. I n other wor ds, y ou enjoy more fr eedom - - y ou have mor e options available to y ou. I f y ou' re a ctive in promoting fre edom, y ou' ll see that most curre nt free dom-promoting activities, while they may y ield short-term be nefits, ar e unlikely to bring about any signific ant expansion of fre edom in the long term. The r eason f or this is that the most basic wa y ty rants and te rroc rats wield their power is a \" control-via- words\" mecha nism. Most curre nt free dom-promoting a ctivities don't a ttack this basic mec hanism; in fact, they tend to reinfor ce a nd perpe tuate it. Under standing Slavespea k enable s y ou to discard a ctivities y ou may otherwise w aste y our pre cious time on. I t enables y ou to focus on ac tiviti es most likely to benef it y ou, while at the sa me time having the g rea test potential for re ducing the power of terr ocra ts, at least insofa r as ter rocr at ac tions infringe on y our per sonal life and a ffa irs."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"A furthe r bene fit of under standing Slavespea k is that y ou' ll become more awa re of how people, g ener ally , are manipulated throug h words.

I use Slavespea k in essentially the same way Orwe ll used Newspe ak, except that Slavespe ak cove rs more w ords than I think Orwe ll would have re g arde d as Ne wspea k.

I ' ve also e x panded w hat I mean by Slavespea k bey ond politics. I specific ally use political Slavespea k in the sense of Orwe ll's ' B voc abular y ' : \"T he ' B voc abular y ' consisted of wor ds which had be en deliber ately constructe d for political purpose s: words, that is to say , which not only had in eve ry case a political impli cation, but wer e intended to impose a desirable mental attitude upon the per son using them... the ' B' words we re a sort of ver bal shorthand, of ten packing whole ra ng es of idea s into a few sy llables... eve n in the ear ly deca des of the Twe ntieth Century , telescope d words and phr ases ha d been one of the char acte ristic fea tures of political lang uag e; and it had be en noticed tha t the tendenc y to use abbre viations of this kind was most m arke d in totalitarian countries a nd totalitarian org anizations... the intention being to make speec h, and espec ially speec h on any subject not ideolog ically neutra l, as nea rly as possible independe nt of consciousne ss... ultim ately it was hoped to make articula te spee ch issue from the lar y nx without involvi ng the hig her br ain ce nters at a ll.

Al Siebert' s book Peak ing Out: How my M ind Broke Fre e from the De lusions of Psychiatry prese nts a trenc hant desc ription of how psy chiatric Slavespea k opera tes and its consequenc es.

He da red to que stion \"incontestable psy chiatric dog ma\" and outlined some bre akthroug h ideas to his \"psy chiatrist teac hers.\" They wer e not amused. The y had him committed to a psy chiatric hospital as a mental patient. The book inc ludes a na rra tive of Siebert' s rea l-life experienc es as a n instit utionaliz ed mental pa tient. I t also tells how Siebert saw throug h the delusional belief sy stem which controls the minds of psy chiatrists.

Tw o Tribes Consider two diffe rent isolated tribe s somewher e in the jung les of South America . Call them Tribe 1 a nd Tribe 2. Ea ch has its unique lang uag e with its own structure. T he lang uag e of Tr ibe 1 (L ang uag e 1) te nds to be very literal. A man w ho fishes, for example, is called \" man-who- fishes.\" The same man, while slee ping, is c alled \" man-who-"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"sleeps\" ; while talking, \" man-who- talks\"; while r unning, \" man-who- runs\" ; while eating , \"ma n-who-e ats\" ; while writing , \"ma n-who-w rites\" ; while making a cha ir, \" man-who- makes-c hair\" ; while g iving or ders, \" man-who- g ives-orde rs\" ; etc. I n L ang uag e 1, distinctions are made betwee n differ ent kinds of words: \" Thing -words,\" \"D o-words,\" \"H ow-wor ds,\" \" Story -words,\" \"F unny -words,\" \"O rder -words,\" \"Panic -words,\" \"What- words,\" \"Who-wor ds,\" \" Why -words,\" \"When- words,\" \"Wher e-w ords,\" etc. Hig h-leve l abstrac tions are r are in lang uag e 1. To the pe ople of Tr ibe 1, any word that doe sn' t refe r to something phy sically perc eivable, is hig hly suspect. The ir test for r eality is phy sical. The lang uag e of Tr ibe 2 (L ang uag e 2) is ver y differ ent. A man who obta ins his wher ewithal mostly by fishing, is c alled \" fisherma n.\" ( This sy stem of nomencla ture would seem a bsurd to the people of Tribe 1 - - how c an y ou call someone a \" fisherma n\" when he is not fishing, but sleeping ? ) L ang uag e 2 conta ins many high- level abstra ctions - - like \" happiness.\" People from Tr ibe 2 ca n talk for hour s about \" happiness.\" (To someone fr om Tribe 1, this would be incompre hensible -- they only talk about \" woman- who-is-ha ppy \" w hile she is happy , and \" woman-w ho-is-sad\" while she is sad. The notion that y ou could sepa rate \"ha ppiness\" f rom a re al per son being happy , and talk about \"ha ppiness\" a s if it ex isted by itself, would be complete ly unthinkable to someone fr om Tribe 1.) To the people from Tribe 2, any word be ing use d is automatically assumed to be pa rt of exis tence , otherwise pe ople wouldn' t use it.

I ' ve re peate d this ex periment seve ral times with simil ar r esults. I ntere stingly , J onathan Swift had no pr oblem with questioning the \" law\" conce pt. He wrote in Gulliver's Tr avels : \"T here was a nother point which a littl e per plexed him... I had said, that some of our cr ew lef t their country on acc ount of being ruined by ' law' ... but he was a t a loss how it shoul d come to pass, that the ' law' which wa s intended for ' ever y ' man' s prese rvation, should be any man' s ruin.

I said there was a society of men a mong us, br ed up fr om their y outh in the art of pr oving by words multipl ied for the purpose, that white is blac k, and blac k is white, acc ording ly as they are paid. To this society all the re st of the people a re slave s.\" [emphasis added] Other possible re asons why many people may find it difficult to question their conce pts or words mig ht be: 1. Most people have never questioned eve n one of the words they use habitually . 2. Acc ording to the principle of ine rtia, it' s easier to continue to think the way y ou' ve alway s thought. Que stioning some of y our basic c oncepts involves a dr amatic c hang e of direc tion -- and some vig orous, ene rg etic thoug ht! 3. Questioning something a bout phy sical re ality is relatively easy , e.g ., I claim that the table has f our leg s. Sim ple observa tion settles the issue. No complex thought proce sses are involved. Howeve r, in questioning the validity of a c oncept or word, we have to use the word, w hile at the same time invalidating the w ord. So we use sy ntax l ike \" the \" law\" (so-c alled)\" -- se lf-re fer encing sy ntax -- involving a c omplex thought pr ocess many may find difficult. F urthermor e, the wor d \"la w\" is a hig h-leve l abstrac tion. I n the ca se of \" the table\" there is a simple one-to-one rela tionship between the sy mbol (word) a nd the object it repre sents -- the r efe rent. B eca use \" law\" is in the domain of verba l rea lity , the issue of the word' s validity cannot be settled by simple observation. While y ou can se e the ink in a so-c alled \" lawbook,\" y ou cannot f ind a simple relationship betwe en the sy mbol \"law\" and its ref ere nt(s). 4. I f y ou talk to y our pee rs in the manner I do to challeng e the ba sic political Slavespeak words, they ' ll most ly think y ou' re c razy .

We don't ha ve a c onvenient, ea sy -to-use sy ntax for questioning wor ds or conc epts. I suspect that many people f ind it difficult to process statements a bout verba l rea lity . So much so, that when I make a statement like, \" The notion that someone is a \" King \" is a form of idolatry or hallucina tion\" (a statement about ve rbal re ality ), they will compulsively \"tr anslate\" (distort) it into, \"He' s say ing tha t Kings don' t exi st\" (a statement about phy sical re ality ). 6. May be ce rtain words - - like \" law,\" \"sta te,\" and \" g overnme nt\" - - have such powe rful hy pnotic eff ects on pe ople, that if they try to question and cha lleng e them, their consciousness \" turns down a f ew notche s\" a nd they can' t think properly . OK, so let' s imag ine a wor ld in which the conc ept \" law\" (in the sense of man-ma de \"la w\" ) is completely absent. Suppose that fr om an ea rly ag e childre n in such a wor ld are taug ht principles like: Actions have conseque nces. Humans have minds they can use to calcula te and pr edict -- at least to some extent -- the conse quence s of ac tions. Obedienc e ca n be dang erous be cause it tends to become a substitut e for thought (ca lculation and pre diction). The more y ou think for y ourself, r ather than obey others, the more y ou lear n and the more e ffe ctive y ou become . Knowledg e adva nces. Toda y ' s wisdom becomes tomorrow ' s superstition. Theref ore question ever y thing. How much powe r could ter rocr ats have in such a wor ld? \"D o what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law,\" said Aleister Crow ley . To me this means that pe ople will do whateve r they will do, irrespec tive of wha t any supposed \" law\" might dictate . The idea that if terr ocra ts were to \"make a law,\" it would solve a problem, is quite sill y . People will stil l do what they will. They may chang e their be havior be cause of the supposed \" law,\" but often they will tend to do so in way s differ ent from ter rocr at expectations. The notion that humans ca n be \" controlled\" by \"la ws\" is fundamentally flawe d. This is so beca use humans ar e volitional entities with mi nds to think, decide, and initiate independe nt action. Of c ourse, humans ma y relinquish their ability to think, decide, and a ct volitionally -- if they acc ept terr ocra t noises and scribbles a s \"la ws\" they must obey , defy -- or repe al.

I n our minds we make all kinds of maps and models of how we think the wor ld works. Our c oncepts (ba sic ideas) and wor ds constitute maps or models which re prese nt or ref lect (w e hope) aspec ts of the world. Our models and maps can be more or le ss useful, measur ed by the re sults we produce using the m. Our models and ma ps -- including our words - - ca n never do more than a pproxi mate the actua l world or the a ctual phenome na they seek to re prese nt. Our maps, models, and words (sy mbols) constitute incomplete abstra ctions -- c ondensed, simplified, and approximated. Ultimately , the ac tual territory defie s verba l description. Ultimately , the word c annot desc ribe the thing . The wor ld (terr itory ) has its form or na ture. Our descr iption of it (map) includes at be st incomplete details.

P reponderance of Me ans over Ends As far as I know (a GS qualification), Ha ns Vaihing er f irst enunciate d this principle in his book The Philosophy of As If . He sa id that our means tend to be come more important than our e nds. For e x ample, we want to bec ome happy . We fig ure if w e make lots of money we' ll be happy . Money become s the means to ac hieve the e nd of happine ss. Many of us then foc us on making money (mea ns), to the extent that we lose sig ht of bec oming happy (end) . The money become s more important than the ha ppiness; means preponde rate over e nds. I n GS a spec ific aspe ct of the more g ener al principle a bove, ca n be for mulated as: The preponde ranc e of the map over the terr itory ; or, reg arding the map as more important than the ter ritory . Making the word more important than the thing . Korzy bski called this \"I ntensional Evaluation -- \"F acts\" L ast.\" I f we eleva te our wor ds in importance a bove our experience of the wor ld, we eva luate intentionally . He c alled this orientation \" un-sane \" beca use its linguistic delusions can e ndang er our succe ss or survival. F or example, if we believe tha t we ca n achie ve g ood health by say ing, \" I cre ate that wha tever I eat is g ood for me,\" and continue w ith unhealthy habits, we be have intentionally or in an un-sa ne manner . Korzy bski claimed that ele vating words over fac ts causes muc h human misery , beca use it leads to dy sfunctional, un-sa ne, eva luating a nd behavior . To ac hieve more sane behavior s, we must look first to ex perie nce. K orzy bski called this \"E x tensional Evaluation -- \"F acts\" First.\" The ter m ext ensional re fer s to elevating experience above lang uag e. When we obse rve, se nse, and the n descr ibe, we e valuate e x tensionally . Korzy bski considere d this a sane wa y to make our e valuations of the wor ld. To look, observe , touch, fe el, test, sample, etc .; and then to desc ribe. Now, if y ou look back a t our two tribes, y ou' ll find that tribe 1 (the sane ones) pr actice extensional evaluation, while tribe 2 ( the un-sane ones) pr actice intensional evalua tion.

Multi-Valued Logic Korzy bski describe d GS as a non-A ristotelian sy stem. I n addition to other fundame ntal differ ence s, Aristotelian log ic has two va lues, while \" non-A\" logic has multiple values.

This multi -value d principle a pplies to many differ ent ar eas. K orzy bsky talks about the \"multi-ordinality \" of terms. Not eve ry one assig ns just one identical meaning to a particula r word.

Simi larly , we c an think in terms of multi-valued ca usality . I t may be naive to think that one spec ific thing simply cause s another. Most eve nts tend to have many cause s and many eff ects.

To test the above theory , I decide d to conver t the entire pa rt of this repor t, dealing with GS, into E-Prime. I t did indeed make me think much more dee ply . I experience d amazement and c onsiderable satisfac tion from the deg ree to which the sec tion on \"people have me aning s for wor ds\" improve d as a r esult of conve rsion into E-Prime -- a vast, unexpected improveme nt!

Rather than, \" I t is commonly acc epted that...,\" y ou want to know in more de tail just who acce pts it, the reliability of the a ssertion that they acc ept it, and possibly why or on wha t basis they acc ept it.

Consider such empty comments as: \" I t is clear tha t...\"; \" Business is business\" ; \"I t's just semantics\" - - the last ofte n used as a n analy sis stopper. You might pr oductively respond, \" OK.
