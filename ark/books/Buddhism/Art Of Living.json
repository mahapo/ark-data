Today we mainly see peop le making o f fering s to the Buddha statues and p raying for bless ings and fo r tune . In this way, Buddh ism ha s been wron gly changed into a r e ligion.

C h a p t e r T h r e e : T h e A r t o f L i v i ng / S e l ec t e d P a ss a g e s Our goal in studying Buddhism is to open up our wisdom; to attain this goa l, we cultivate pu rity of mind. In today ’ s soc i ety, our greatest obstacles are TV, radio, newspapers and magazines fi these all contain contents that can pollute our minds. I often persuade people not to read or listen to these things. When our hearts are free from these unneeded affli c tions, we can live each day in peace and happiness; thus, a l lowing ou r mind s to return to purity. W ith an undeluded mind, one will see matters of life clearer, more deeply and farther than others. This is because a settled and concentrated mind is a mind of wisdom. The key in cultivating the Buddha ’ s teachings is having a settled and concentrated mind. In pra c ticing the Pure Land method, purity of mind is of foremost i m portance. The Infinite Life Sutra teaches us to cultivate purity, equality and enlightenment. Being mindful of the Buddha is cultivating the above, for Buddha Amitabha is purity, equality, and enligh t enment. When we recite the Buddha ’ s name, we are reminded of these qual i ties. In China, Buddhism can be divided into ten schools. Aside from the two Small Vehicle schools, which have already d e clined, the eight remaining schools belong to the Great Vehicle. Two schools (Zen and Shing) enter the Buddha ’ s teachings through the method of flUnderstanding / Enlightenment. ̊ They seek the great enlightenment, to understand the heart/mind and uncover the self-nature. Usually, those of lesser capabilities to become enlightened on their own have much difficulty in reaching their goals through this method. Thus, to cultiv ate the Zen Sc hool requires a high level of wisdom, ability and a co n siderably pure mind. Without these, one would have to start"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE ART OF LIVING 7 learning from the basis of Buddha Shakyamuni ’ s teachings. The study of these teachings is to help establish proper unde r standing and viewpoints; thus, the method of flProper Views and Knowledge ̊ is used here to enter the Buddha ’ s teachings. There are four schools in this category (Tian Tai, Shian Shou, Fa Shiang and San Lwun). The practitioners of these schools study and follow the teachings of Buddha Shakyamuni to co r rect their erroneous views, thoughts, and actions. Most people are capable of learning this method, but it is a long journey, such as going to school. One must start from elementary school, then gradually advance grade by grade to junior high, high school, and college. In finishing one grade, one attains the benefit of that single grade. The final two schools are the Pure Land and the Esoteric. These stress the importance of cultiva t ing purity of mind; thus, their method of practicing the Bu d dha ’ s teachings is through purity. People of all capabilities, regardless of whether they are intelligent o r le ss able can pra c tice the Pure Land School. All can practice and succeed in cu l tivating Pure Land method. On the other hand, the Esoteric School requires a high level of purity of mind, making it very difficult to reach attai n men t. The difference between th e cultiva tion of pu rity in th e Pure Land School and the Esoteric School is that the Pure Land School teaches us to cultivate purity of mind away from poll u tion, while the Esoteric School teaches us to cultivate purity of mind in the midst of pollution. The latter involves a state of being immersed in pollution but not being contaminated; nat u ra lly, this s tate is too difficu lt for mo st people to a t ta in. True wisdom arises from purity of mind, thus, the wisdom spoken of in the Buddha ’ s teachings is not attained from rea d ing and studying books; the wisdom we attain from reading and studying is only worldly knowledge and not true wisdom. True wisdom is the function of our self-nature. Our self-nature is comple te with infin ite wisdom, virtue s and abilities ; qualities th at are present in everyone ’ s self-nature and we need to know how to bring them out."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"TH E AR T O F LIVING 8 flBuddha ̊ is Pu rity, Equa lit y, and Enligh tenmen t.

Fourth is Universal Worthy Bodhisattva of E-Mei Mountain, repr e senting true practice. These four great Bodhisattvas represent the core of cultivation. As beginners, we start learning from Earth Treasury, for the earth is the root of life of all living b e ings. Because the great earth nurtures all beings and is the treasury of all that is precious, the Buddha uses it to represent our flmind ground ̊ or flmind earth. ̊ Our true mind/original nature is complete with infinite wisdom, virtuous abilities and talents; we must know how to open this treasury in order to a t tain its b enefits. Earth Treasury Bodhisattva teaches us to be filial to our parents and respectful to our teachers, for in these practices lies the key to opening the tre asury of ou r se lf-na ture. The field of filial piety is vast. Our parents have shown us great kindness in bringing us up and in educating us, therefore, we should not only nurture their aging bodies, but we should also nurture their spiritual well-being and minds thus helping them to be happy; this is practicing fi l ial p iety. Regarding the practice of filial piety, we should strive to do our best in living up to our parent ’ s expectations. When they wish us to be good persons and to benefit society, we should do so; to act otherwise would be unfilial. For children going to school, it would be unfilial to do poorly in schoolwork, causing one ’ s parents to be worried and disappointed. It would be unfilial if one ’ s conduct was poor, or if one ’ s health was poor, or if one was disrespectful to one ’ s teachers or could not get along with others. After reaching adulthood and entering socie ty, it would be unfilial to b e rebe lliou s towards one ’ s boss or unable to c o operate with co-workers, causing one ’ s parents to worry. From these, we realize how vast the field of cultivating filial p i ety really is, and that the entire Buddhadharma is actually just teaching the Way of Filial Piety. In Buddhism, the perfection of filial piety is only completed upon reaching the Unsurpassed Enlightenment of Buddh a hood. Nowadays, humankind has been seriously polluted in heart, thoughts, views, spirit and body, thus leading to the appearance of many strange illne sses.

It seems as if one cannot be free from household chores for a single day, and many are greatly troubled by their duties. However, if we can learn to change our way of looking at things, we will be able to perform our chores with great joy. Much of the problem is that ordinary people are very much attached to the flself. ̊ They think, fl I am doing all this work; poor me , I am so tired; why should I do this for them? ̊ The more they th ink this way, the more afflic ted they be come.

Once we have performed our duties well, we become role models for homemakers all over the world and an example for all families to follow. Thus, not only can we help our neighbors, but extended, we can influence society, the country, and even the world in a positive way. From this we co me to s ee tha t in dus t ing, sweeping, washing, and cooking, a homemaker Bodhisattva is actually carrying out the great vow of helping all living beings. This is truly being a student of the Buddha. So, if we can co n template our duties as described above, we will be filled with p eace and happiness in our work. How then could anything tro u ble us? The most important factor in learning and cultivating the Buddha ’ s teachings is that one be able to practice them in ev e ryday life. If not, then studying the Buddha ’ s teachings will be meaningless. Understanding this, we would be able to practice the Six Principles Cultiva ted by B odhisattvas at our work and o f fice.

Ever y one in the so cie ty is interdep endent and inte r-re lated ; we can prac tice good deeds to repay them. How many people recognize the kindness shown by parents? Usually, people do not realize until they themselves become parents or lose their parents. We can show our gratitude through practicing filial piety by being responsible, conside r ate and compl i ant to our parents. To be a poor, content, and happy person is better than being one who is rich, worried, and a f flic ted with g reed.

Cultiva ting virtue is to k eep a kind hea rt, sp eak kind words and do kind acts to benefit others. Wise persons do not harbor feelings of gain or loss.

If our practice fails to follow these principles then we have missed the point. Take the Diamond Sutra for example. As it begins, the Buddha takes us into his daily life. This is unlike other Mahayana sutras in which he would release radiant light at the beginning of his talk. However, this talk is all about everyday life! Every a c tion the Buddha has taken has revealed his virtues and merits due to his commitment of practicing Buddhahood through infinite lifetimes.

The benefits begin the minute we start to correct our thoughts and a c tions. We would do well to live our lives with a clear mind and to be proper in thought and action, not being tempted by erroneous influences. If we are able to do this, then no matter which method we choose we will be true fo llowers o f the B uddha. As our daily thinking becomes clearer, our mind will become purer, enabling us to live happier, peaceful and fulfilling lives. When I heard of a suggestion made by the late Mr. Lian-Jui Xia to use the name Pure Land Buddhist Learning Center instead of the traditional name of temple, I thought it was appropriate for today ’ s society. Buddhism has always been forward thinking not backward. It has adap ted to ex is ting cu lture s and l o ca litie s."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE ART OF LIVING 31 When Buddhism first came to China, it took on aspects of the Chinese culture. The temples had a Chinese appearance, the monks and nuns clothing was in the Chin ese s tyle. If the temp les had followed Ind ian design, the Chinese would not have wanted to enter such a foreign looking place. The teachings were inte r preted in a way that enabled the Chinese peop le to merge t hem into their d aily live s, thus t hey w ere readily accepted. The Di a mond Sutra te lls u s tha t nothing is permanen t, while the Sura n gama Sutra explains that everything should accord with the minds of sentient beings. All this is to remind us to accord with local cond i tions. At a talk one time in M iami, the re were quite a few Bu d dhists who were westerners. I told them that Buddhism had not yet officially come to America. They asked why I had said that when Buddhism was very popular in America. I asked them, flHave you ever seen Buddhist statues with features that resemble a westerner? ̊ They briefly thought about it and realized that what I had said was true. When Buddhism spread to China, pictures and statues of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas adopted Chinese features. In Japan, they have Japanese features. The same applies to Tha i land, Tibet and so on. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas do not have only one fixed appearance, rather they appear in the form that is most acceptable and comfortable for the local people. Furthermore, Buddhism adapts to take on the aspects of the local culture. In America, a typical Buddhist temple needs to look like the White House and no t lik e a traditional Ch inese te m ple. When Americans see a Chinese temple, they would think of it as foreign and might not feel comfortable going in. However, if the buildings look like the White House, they would go in uni n vited! Do you not think that they would be happy to see Buddhas and Bodhisattvas with western fe a tures ? They certa inly would. We need to remember that Buddhism is an education. As it spreads through America, it will take on a more western appea r ance just as it did when Indian teachers brought it to China, where it took on a Chinese appearance.

Why do some Buddhists exclude the five pungent veget a ble s fro m the ir diet? Answer. So me Buddh ists who foll ow a strict diet do no t eat the five pungen t vege tables; on ion s, garlic, ch ives, g reen o nion s and lee ks. The Buddha said tha t the se ad versely a ff ect those who a re in the ea rly stages of cu ltiva tion. If ea ten coo ked, they pr o du ce ho rmon es. Eaten raw, they may aff ect the li ve r, lead ing o ne to bec ome irr itab le and less ab le to conce ntrate. P lease unde r stand that this only happen s if you ea t t hem in large qu antities. There is no prob lem if a mod erate amoun t is used for cook ing. The same app lies for alcoh ol and intox ican ts. Intox ica tion can be a fac tor in cau sing err oneou s behav ior. The Buddha warned peop le aga inst alcoho l or intox ica nts to g uide them in the av oidance of comm itting misdeeds due to intox icati on. Therefore, the p recep ts that the Buddha set forth rea lly depend upon the e n vironmen t an d the situation that we are in."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THE ART OF LIVING 35 Our society is different from that of Buddha Shakyamuni ’ s. If he were to re-appear in this world, I am sure the Buddha would encourage the use of garlic, simply because it can be used to cure some diseases, especially lung disease. Many years ago, I was teaching at the Eastern Buddhist Co l lege. During that period, we found out that a few of the students had lung diseases. Dr. Tang, who was one of the professors, su g gested that they use garlic for treatment. He told us of an event that had happened in China some time ago. A patient was told by his doctor that due to his end stage of TB, he only had three months to live. The patient ’ s family was also told to let him have anything he asked for, with one condition; that he lived apa rt from h is fa m ily. His fa mily, the refore, bu ilt a roo m for him to live in a veget a ble garden and deli v ered meals to him every day. In that garden, grew a large amount of garlic. Due to his is o lation and boredom, he tried the garlic raw and discovered that he enjoyed the taste of it. Soon the garlic became more of a snack for him. Three months later, h e was still aliv e, and mon ths after that, he was beco ming healthier and healthier. His family found it strange and thinking there had been a misdiagnosis took him back to the hospital. The doctor was astonished at what he saw and immediately gathered a group of specialists to investigate his patient ’ s case. Finally, they found out it was the garlic that cured the disease! From then on, many medicines for lung disease have been made with garlic. Regretfully, when Dr. Tang suggested that those st u dents use garlic for treatment, his suggestion was not accepted. The students did not want to violate the precepts even though their il l ness was contagious. Therefore, precepts have to be flexible and to consider environmental conditions. Nowadays, almost everything we eat, such as, meat, fish and even vegetables, contains either chemicals or preservatives, which are harmful to us. In addition, we are seeing more and more people with diseases that have not previously e x is ted."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"THE ART OF LIVING 36 Even the taste of meat is different now. Years ago, chicks and piglets were raised in the open, so they were happier and that a f fected the taste of the meat. Now animals are raised in a narrow space with no place to move. Do you think they are happy? I heard that in Taiwan, the piglets are injected with chemicals so they grow more quickly. Their life span is only six months and the chickens only live for six weeks! Even vegetables and grains are no exce p tion s to be ing co n ta mina ted. How could we not get sick? Therefore, garlic is good for us, although it is harmful to our eyes when taken in large quan tities. Q u e s ti on. The Buddha taught us not to kill, but what should we do about i n sects such as mosqu itoes and flies? A n s w e r . The Buddha not only taught us to protect all animals, but also plants. Even plants have lives and grow with dignity. Therefore, unless there is absolutely no space for us to walk around them, we should not step on them because that behavior is an insult and di s respec tfu l to th e plants. Normally, when a tree is as tall as human, there is a tree spirit. In ancient times, monk s often lived in moun tain hu ts. Three day s before they cut a tree to build the hu t, they would respectfully te ll of their intention and ask the tree spirit to move to a safe place. This method can be applied to insects. In order to keep our houses and environment clean and our family healthy, we can stand in front of a statue of the Buddha or Bodhisattva three days before our actions and ask the insects to move.
