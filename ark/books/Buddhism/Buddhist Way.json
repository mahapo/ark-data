Such rites, which origi - nated even long before the various major world religions became established, have been handed down by our forefathers, and in the passage of time, have gradually assumed the form of tradi - tional customary practices until the present day. We continue to practise many of these rites through ignorance and fear, not daring to change or discard them even with the acquisition of a modern education and sophisticated life-style. In particular many of the rites performed on sad occasions like death and funerals are shrouded in mystery and superstition, and very often incur a tremendous financial burden on bereaved families. is is one of the major reasons why many Buddhists are easily converted to other religions because it offers good ammunition for other religionists to hurl their criticisms and attacks on the Buddhists. It is imperative that the Buddhist community in this country should awaken to this situation and make courageous efforts to make reforms in the performance of their rites and rituals in consonance with correct Buddhist reli - gious principles. is book presents in a simple and understandable man - ner the various rites which could be performed by Buddhists on happy and sad occasions in their lives.

Having a baby and bring - ing him up is an adventure that can be embarked upon happily and with confidence. At the same time it means the beginning of a long period of sacrifice and responsibility for the parents. Even though human beings are far advanced on the evolution - ary ladder, their young normally take a long time to mature and become independent. Parents have the onerous duty of bear - ing the responsibility of caring for their children and nurturing them to become useful adults of the future. However over the centuries, societies have developed certain well-tested formulae to guide parents in this task of child rearing. In this connec - tion religion plays a central role in providing parents with a framework within which to train the young in ethics, behaviour and morality. In Buddhism, the Buddha has given very useful advice on the duties of parents towards their children and vice versa. e igalovada utra is perhaps the best known of these valuable injunctions. e Buddha related an incident of how he had once noticed a young man performing a simple ritual of bowing to the six directions ( north , south , east , west , zenith and nadir ). Upon being questioned as to the meaning and intent of"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"    his action, the young man replied that he did not know the sig - nificance of his performance but that he was merely following his late father’s advice. Characteristically, the Buddha did not condemn the young man for performing such a ritual, but gave it a useful meaning by a practical interpretation. He said that the act of paying respects to the six directions signifies honour - ing and fulfilling one’s duties and obligations to one’s parents, teachers, religious personalities, one’s wife, children and em - ployees. us, we see that the Buddha laid great emphasis on a person’s relationship with others, but more especially so be - tween parents and children. Parents must care for they children, by allowing them their independence when the time is right and by giving them their rightful inheritance in due course. On the other hand, children on their part are duty-bound to care for their parents by extending to them filial devotion. is is done out of mutual respect and gratitude towards them and not out of expectation of any reward in return. It is indicated here that there is a close link between religion and parent-children relationship. Parents should not fail to underscore the religious significance of the birth of a child. A family that develops its relationship along sensible established religious lines cannot go wrong. Parents are duty-bound to develop such a relationship based on their religious cultural heritage.

Many Buddhists ask whom they can turn to when they are confronted with insecurity. In such circumstances Buddhists can recall the Buddha to their mind and seek solace. ere is no doubt that the Buddhist concept of god is different from that in other religions but when they contemplate the supreme qualities of the Buddha, his great victories, and his calm and noble characteristics, their minds will be calmed and they will gain confidence. Even many other religionists say god is not a person, but a force which is personalized in the mind. When their minds are calmed and strengthened by focusing on this power, they are in a position to face disturbances to evaluate the problems and find the means to overcome them. Buddhists can overcome their problems in a similar manner by recalling the image of the Buddha. Naturally many of our problems are caused by the mind and mind alone is able to solve them through understanding and confidence. at is why the knowledge of the Dharma is important. When the mind is strengthened through inspiration and devotion towards the Buddha it can overcome the sense of helplessness and fear of evil spirits, of being left alone, and confidence is regained. us is what is meant by going for refuge to the Buddha.

In course of time the child will get used to performing Buddhist practices and will feel comfortable amidst the serene atmosphere in the temple surroundings. Of course children should also be brought to the temple for special blessing services on important occa - sions like their first day at school, examinations, birthdays and other happy events. When children get used to listening to the sutras, they acquire immense confidence in themselves because they know that through the beneficial influence of the sutras, they are being protected. ey therefore tend to perform better in whatever undertaking they set out to do, and as a result are less nervous, feel more secure and will no longer have the dread of being left utterly helpless."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"    Buddhist families should live in the light of the Buddha"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"    B E  C P An effective way to introduce religious lessons for the young on morality and ethics is by using pictures, illustrations, religious symbols and by giving interesting talks on Buddhist legends and stories. is method may appeal to many people, especially the young and it can help them to appreciate Buddhism much better. Certain stage performances or sketches depicting his - torical Buddhist legendary events can also help to create a good and lasting impression on the young minds. To lead children on the right path, parents themselves should first set the example and lead ideal lives. It is impossible to expect worthy children from unworthy parents. Apart from Kammic tendencies, children are influenced by the defects and virtues of parents too. Responsible parents should take precau - tion not to transmit negative traits to their children. e Buddha’s advice regarding traditions and customs was neither to accept nor to reject anything without first considering whether such practices are meaningful and useful. Less empha - sis is placed on these methods once a person has learned the Dhamma to lead a meaningful Buddhist life. e Buddha says that whatever methods we use to train the mind, our attitude should be like a man who used a raft to get across a river.

Because of ignorance, fear and superstition each group tends to accept the beliefs of others rather than study - ing them rationally and discarding them as being irrelevant to modern society. For example many Asian communities believe that they must not clip their finger nails after dark nor wash their hair on certain days of the week. Some people think that it is bad luck to see shaven headed religious men the first thing in the morning whilst others will not sweep their houses after dark. It is even believed to be bad to carry meat around at night for fear that it might attract evil spirits. Some parents advise their children to carry a piece of metal to protect themselves from ghosts. en there are those who believe that howling dogs and hooting owls at night could bring bad luck and that a twitching of the left eye is a bad omen.

Popular Buddhism has not been spared by the antics of these quacks and charlatans, some of whom even going to the extent of masquerading themselves as monks to make a fast dollar from their unsuspecting victims. But the Buddha has declared in no uncertain terms that many of our misfortunes are essentially created by the untrained impure minds and it is only through our own efforts and understanding that we will be able to overcome them. In this country particularly there are a great many such beliefs. is may be because the three major races have their own peculiar beliefs, and a great deal of interchange had taken place so much so that there had developed a tremendously varied set of beliefs which are uniquely Malaysian. e Buddhist cure for misfortune of any kind is as scien - tific as the methods of modern psychiatry.

Because of our ignorance of the non-existence of a permanent self, we believe in our ego and this belief gives rise to craving. We are filled with insatiable desires and fear of losing that which we possess. We fear that we will be harmed or that we will face ‘bad luck’. So what do we do? We turn instinctively to our animistic past and depend on special talismans and amulets to protect us. e Buddha has clearly stated that external objects are not strong enough to pro - tect those whose minds are weak and confused. Our only secu - rity is to take refuge in our knowledge of the truth and in our realization of the true nature of the self and other phenomena. Once we understand that there is no reality in a self that can be harmed, we become secure and confident. No harm can come to him who is unafraid, unselfish or undeluded. However, it does not mean that Buddhism condemns the use of certain religious objects like a pendant of the Buddha im - age to give us a sense of security.

We too can carry images of the Buddha or inscriptions of the sutras around with us to give us confidence. Many sutras end with the invocation:- “ By the power of this truth, may victory be mine” or “may happiness be mine ”. is shows that as Buddhists we do not believe in the animistic power of images or talismans, but that they are to be regarded as mere aids which could help us to gain confidence in ourselves.

Critics point out that followers of certain other religions do go from hos - pital to hospital comforting sick patients. Such concern for the sick is something which is indeed commendable. In Buddhist countries devotees invite monks to visit the sick and the monks are more than willing to render assistance in this respect. In fact learned monks who are very well versed in traditional medicine, are often consulted and they even render their voluntary services. Since many Buddhists are not well versed in their own religion to counteract the tactics of other religionists, such apathy only enable the followers of other religions to take advantage of the situation to convert them. Such other religionists have even gone to the extent of promising salvation by frightening their victims with the threat of hell and in this way have won converts!

Many ignorant people have taboos against death and do not like to attend funerals during certain periods think - ing that it will bring bad luck to themselves. Children must learn from a young age that death is a natural part of existence. ey must learn not to be unnaturally afraid at the sight of coffins and corpses. ey must know what is the sensible thing to do at a funeral.

As such, birth and death are taking place every moment. e phenomenon of death is merely a more dramatic ending of this continual proc - ess. But the end is not permanent.

So there is no need to fear death. In view of this, the Buddha did not prescribe any specific rites regarding the disposal of a corpse. e body of a dead person should be removed with dignity and be treated properly out of respect for the memory of what the deceased person had done when he was alive. His past action ( Karma ) will determine what his future life will be. We are grateful for whatever services the dead person had ren - dered to us in the past. Sorrow arises in our minds because someone we love has departed from our midst. When we gather around the body of a loved one, as friends and relatives we find solace in the company of others who share our common sorrow and who give us moral support in our hour of grief. e differ - ent cultural practices we perform are useful because they help us to minimise our sorrow.

Sometimes relatives object to this practice thinking that it is somewhat sacrilegious to cut up or mutilate a corpse. As far as Buddhists are concerned there should be no religious reason to object to this practice. In fact, if such a post mortem could help the living by providing members of the medical profession with more information which could enable them to cure diseases it should be considered an act of merit on the part of Buddhists. As has been said earlier the physical body is nothing more than a combination of elements which will disintegrate on death. So there is no reason to believe that the spirit of the dead person will be upset if the body is used for scientific purposes. We can be rest assured that doctors and medical aides have a high sense of responsibility and professional ethics and that they would handle a corpse with the utmost respect due to it, so relatives need not be unduly worried about this. ere are some who even pledge to donate their bodies after their death to hospitals for medical students to study anatomy.

A Buddhist funeral should accord - ingly be a solemn occasion and should be conducted as such. ere is a widespread superstition among some people that it is “bad luck” to bring a corpse into a home if a person has died elsewhere. We are bound to show our respect for the memory of the dead person to treat the body with proper respect by giving it a decent funeral. Whether the body is brought home or not depends on what is most convenient for the bereaved members of the family. In this connection we should also mention that there should be no fears or taboos regarding the handling of a dead person. Some people are afraid to touch a corpse thinking they will be faced with “bad luck”. If this were true doctors and nurses should be the most miserable people on earth! If we truly wish to honour the memory of our departed ones, we should bathe and dress the body and not leave it to some stranger from an undertaker’s firm to do it for us. Remember that superstition ignorance and irrational fear brings more “bad luck” than grati - tude, love and good taste. Contrary to popular belief, the noisy, elaborate and some - times showy or grand funeral processions costing thousands of dollars on unneccesary things and which are often regarded as normal ‘Buddhist practices’, are in fact not Buddhist practices at all.

When viewing such funeral rites people of other faiths often wonder whether what they are watching is a procession celebrating some happy festival or a solemn funeral. Quite often a loud music instead of solemn music, is per - formed during a funeral procession. One would therefore gain the impression that the ceremony is designed more to make an outward show of affluence rather than to express genuine sorrow and respect for the deceased. Although Buddhism does not ob - ject to perpetuating cultural practices, so long as they are not in conflict with the teachings of the Buddha, it is felt that wasteful, uneconomical and unnecessary practices which are not benefi - cial either to the departed or the living should be discouraged or discarded altogether. For example, the traditional practice of burning paper money, joss-paper and symbolic paper houses, designed purportedly for the benefit of a deceased person for use in the life hereafter, is definitely unBuddhistic. However, if it helps one psychologically to minimise one’s sorrow by making him think he is doing something beneficial for the departed, it is harmless, but nonetheless one should not go to extremes or believe it can help the deceased in any way.

However if the obituary notice specifically states “no flowers”, then this request should be strictly respected. Because relatives have different opinions on funeral rites there are many arguments about the proper rituals to be per - formed. People have often asked the following questions: 1. Should there be a burial or cremation? 2. If cremation, what does one do with the ashes? 3. What kind of coffin must we use? 4. Must we wear black or white mourning clothes? 5. What colour of candles must be used, red or white? 6. How many days must the body be kept before burial or cremation? 7. What is the limit of expenditure for a funeral? All these questions can simply be answered in this way: e funeral must be simple, with the least amount of fuss, but with dignity. Perhaps the most sensible thing to do would be for the immediate members of the family and close friends to have an informal discussion on the best way to conduct the funeral service in conformity with prevailing practice, with qui - et dignity and without incurring unnecessary expense.

It has to be remembered that as far as Buddhist rites are concerned there are no hard and fast rules to be strictly observed. In this as in all matters we must always try to follow the Buddha’s advice to maintain moderation and respectability in whatever we do, without causing harm to others. If we can use the occasion to contemplate with gratitude the good work done by the deceased during his life time, to remember that we ourselves will have to depart some day and that we should do whatever good we can for so long as we live, then our contribution would be meaning - ful and dignified. What is the proper attire for a funeral? In Buddhism we are advised to always dress decently and moderately. ere is no hard and fast rules as to what we should wear at a funeral, but good taste dictates that we should dress sombrely and discard ornaments in deference to the feelings of the bereaved family and out of respect for the memory of the deceased. A woman in mourning may perhaps wear her wedding or engagement ring.

We who live in a hot and humid climate should understand that decomposition takes place very fast and that it is unhygienic to keep a body for far too long. Besides, it would impose a great strain on the relatives of the deceased in having to bear with the proximity of the corpse for a period longer than is really neces - sary. Also certain mourners out of sheer emotional grief tend to kiss the body and touch it excessively. is is understandable given the strong emotional feelings that people have to bear, but it should not be overdone or encouraged. While one can - not dictate exactly as to how long a body should be kept, it is wise not to unnecessarily prolong the rites. As a general rule it seems most practical to allow a lapse of about a day or two for funeral arrangements to be made and for friends or relatives to be informed. On the day of the funeral, the services of Buddhist monks would again be called on to perform the necessary religious service at the home and at the cemetery. It has been the prac - tice amongst certain people to offer roasted pigs and chickens as symbolic offerings for the deceased. Such a practice is not encouraged in Buddhism because it involves the killing of inno - cent animals. To offer sacrificial offerings to the departed ones is definitely against the teachings of the compassionate Buddha and should be discarded.

Buddhism, being a free religion, is flex - ible on this issue. ere is no hard and fast rule, although in some Buddhist countries, cremation is the normal accepted practice. e choice of one method or another should be in accordance with the last wish of the deceased or be left to the discretion of the next-of-kin. In the modern concept however, cremation as a hygienic form of disposal of the body, should be encouraged. With the improvement in health standards and the so-called population explosion, usable land is becoming scarce and hence it is advis - able to resort to cremation and allow the use of valuable land for the living instead of crowding it with innumerable tomb - stones. Whether for burial or cremation, it has been observed that certain people for sentimental reasons, would like to put valuable personal belongings of the deceased into the coffin in the hope and belief that the departed one would in some way benefit by it. It is a fallacy to expect that burial or burning of such belongings would have any merit at all.

Upon death only two elements will remain, namely Solidity and Fluidity which, when reduced to ashes, has no spiritual significance.

In contrast to this there is another practice, namely that of ancestral worship whereby the living maintained contacts with the dead by observing ritualistic practices around the dead. is gave rise to the practice of preserving the ashes in urns or other receptacles to be revered — a practice which is still being car - ried on even to this day. Some people wish to enshrine the remains in a building while others bury them. Another method is to throw the ashes into the sea or a river. is is basically a Hindu custom where the belief is that the remains will ultimately be re-united with the original creative force. ere is no harm in adopting any of these methods but they must not be considered as being specifically Buddhist or which Buddhists must follow.
