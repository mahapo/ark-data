It is primarily because, this is the only original poem written in English on the Buddha, throughout the long history of Buddhism. This dis- tinction is quite necessary to be established, because there are translations of original Pali works into English and other languages. Some of these are outstanding instances of spiritual poetry. Sir Edwin Arnold, the Author of this epic poem, was ini- tially persuaded to compose this sacred work, as a result of his deep and abiding desire to aid in the better and more wholesome mutual understanding between East and West. His discovery and profound appreciation of the peren- nial philosophies of ancient India, could form a subject for a substantial research paper. In his early youth in Eng- land, Edwin Arnold felt the fi rst stirrings of the Muse. His adept command over poetic expression, won him the New- gate Prize at the University College, Oxford in 1852, for his poem “The Feast of the Belahazzar”. Sir Edwin Arnold"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 Edwin Arnold was born in Sussex, England on July 10, 1832. He received his primary education at Royal College, Rochester. Later on he studied at King’s College, London. During his days at this place lie won a scholarship that took him to Oxford. He was twenty-four when he came over to India to assume duties as Principal, Deccan College, Poona. From the fi rst, the host culture overwhelmed him with its nobility and variegated manifestations. With him, it was not merely the casual surprise that the initial meeting with a strange culture engenders in a new comer to a way of life and thought, different from one’s own. Eventually, his surprise evolved into enchantment, escalating progressively into last- ing admiration. To get to the heart of this ancient and exotic culture, Edwin Amold — the Indian Civil Servant — started exploring the age-old languages of India — Pali and Sanskrit mostly, to be able to experience the new culture from inside. He sought the help of Pandits (savants) who revealed to him the secret knowledge and eternal wisdom locked up within these eso- teric words. Doors, that usually remain closed for the rou- tine bureaucrat began to open wide mysteriously to Edwin Arnold. With befi tting awe and reverence, he approached the grand epics of India — Ramayana and Maha Bharata."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 When one delves deeply into the philosophic profundi- ties of India, one cannot help but discover the religious institutions of renunciation and asceticism, which form an essential part of the Indian spiritual system. From there, it is just a matter of course to the discovery of the Greatest Ascetic and the Renunciate par-excellence of India — Gotama the Buddha. His admiration quickly graduated into a self-imposed duty. He resolved that what he has discovered through his exploratory effort, of the core and the substance of the Indian Philosophic tradition should be communicated to his own people in their language. He worked assiduously. His “Light of Asia” according to him, was composed, “in the brief intervals of days without leisure.” Edwin Arnold’s “Light of Asia”, fi rst appeared in 1879 — when lie was 47. The book has had numerous reprints since then. Millions of readers, the world over, would have savoured the spiritual ecstasy of absorbing the lyrical word of Edwin Arnold on the life and the teachings of the Buddha. In its diction and rhythm, Edwin Arnold’s “Light of Asia”, resonates with echoes of the “Organ roll of Milton’s Music.” It Is quite evident that Edwin Arnold was profoundly"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 impressed by the poetic quality by John Milton’s great reli- gious epics. Reading Edwin Arnold’s “Light of Asia”, is a rich expe- rience in high poetry. His poetry swathes the character of Prince Siddhartha and later the Buddha, The Supremely En- lightened One in a scintillating mantle of spiritual heroism. The telling detail in “Light of Asia”, especially in such descriptions as the education of the Prince — displays an astounding and painstaking effort at pursuing the relevant research. Fully aware that the life of the Buddha can in no way be told in poetry with a perfectly objective mind, Edwin Arnold narrates his epic from the viewpoint of a Buddhist votary. Sir Edwin Arnold’s other works are overshadowed by his widespread reputation as the author of “Light of Asia”. Among his other works are: * The Book of Good Counsels (from the Sanskrit of “Hitopadesa”). * Indian Song of Songs (from Jayadeva’s Gita Govinda) 1875. * Song celestial Bhagavat Gita) 1885. * Indian Idylls (from Mahabharata 1883. * Pearls of the Faith."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 He also wrote a poem on Christ entitled “Light of the World”. Sir Edwin Arnold is also the Author of a work enti- tled “A History of the Administration of India, under Mar- quis of Dulhonsie.” In later years, on his return to England, Edwin Arnold became leader-writer for the “Daily Telegraph. Light of Asia was written during his Daily Telegraph days. Towards the end of his life Sir Edwin Arnold resided in Japan. His third wife was a Japanese lady. The two works “Seas and Lands” (1891) and “Japonica” 1892, record his impressions of Japanese life. The British Government honoured him by conferring the title K.C.I.E. on him in 1888. A writer, contributing a piece to the Sinhala weekly “Budusarana” in Sri Lanka, on February 12, 1996 states that Sir Edwin Arnold visited Sri Lanka, to study Buddhism. The article states that he learnt the Sinhala Language as well. This writer is of the view that Sir Edwin Arnold became a Buddhist. It is quite evident however, that Sir Edwin Arnold attempted to create an enthusiasm for a Buddhist revival in Sri Lanka and Japan. Sir Edwin Arnold passed away on March 14, 1904 at the age of 71. Generation after generation will remember and revere him for his “Light of Asia”. by Edwin Ariyadasa"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 Two and a half thousand years ago there lived in North India a prince, Siddhàrtha, who renounced his worldy wealth and a position and wandered the land in search of understanding and the secret of sorrow. After many expe- riences, as he sat one day in meditation, illumination came to him and he became the Buddha, the Enlightened One. Thereafter, through out his life, he taught the Law of Righteousness, the Middle Way. Sir Edwin Arnold has tendered in exquisite poetic form the story of the Buddha’s search, enlightenment, and teaching. First published in 1879, the book has become a classic and has been published in many editions and in many languages. Not only is it deeply philosophical in nature, but because of its poetic form and is narrative of the dramatic incidents in Siddhàrtha’s life, it is delightful and absorbing reading."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 Author’s Preface I n the following Poem I have sought, by the medium of an imaginary Buddhist votary, to depict the life and charac- ter and indicate the philosophy of that noble hero and re- former, Prince Gautama of India, the founder of Buddhism. A generation ago little or nothing was known in Europe of this great faith of Asia, which had nevertheless existed during twenty-four centuries, and at this day surpasses, in the number of its followers and the area of its prevalence, any other form of creed. Four hundred and seventy millions of our race live and die in the tenets of Gautama; and the spiritual dominions of this ancient teacher extend, at the present time, from Nepal and Ceylon, over the whole East- ern Peninsula, to China, Japan, Tibet, Central Asia, Sibe- ria, and even Swedish Lapland. India itself might fairly be included in this magnifi cent Empire of Belief; for though the profession of Buddhism has for the most characteristic habits and convictions of the Hindus are clearly due to the benign infl uence of Buddha’s precepts. More than a third of mankind, therefore, owe their moral and religious ideas to this illustrious prince, whose personality, though imper- fectly revealed in the existing sources of information, cannot but appear the highest, gentlest, holiest, and benefi cent, with one exception, in the history of Thought. Discordant in frequent particulars, and sorely overlaid by corruptions,"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 inventions, and misconceptions, the Buddhistical books yet agree in the one point of recording nothing — no single act or word — which mars the perfect purity and tenderness of this Indian teacher, who united the truest princely qualities with the intellect of a sage and the passionate devotion of martyr. Even M. Barthélémy St. Hilaire, totally misjudging, as he does, many points of Buddhism, is well cited by Pro- fessor Max Muller as saying of Prince Siddhàrtha, “ Sa vie n’a point de tache. Son constant héroãsme égale sa conviction; et si la théorie qu’il préconise est fausse, les exemples person- nels qu’il donne sont irréprochables. Il est le modèle achvé de toutes les vertus qu’il préche; son abnégation, sa charité, son inaltérable douceur ne se démentent point un seul instant.... Il prépare silencieusement sa doctrine par six années de retraite et de méditation; il la propage par la seule puissance de la parole et de la persuasion pendant plus d’ un demi-siècle, et quand il meurt entre les bras de ses disciples, c’est avec la sérénité d’un sage qui a pratiqué le bien toute sa vie, et qui est assuré d’avoir trouvé le vrai.” To Gautama has conse- quently been granted this stupendous conquest of human- ity; and — though he discountenanced ritual, and declared himself, even when on the threshold of Nirvana, to be only what all other men might become — the love and gratitude of Asia, disobeying his mandate, have given him fervent wor- ship. Forests of fl owers are daily laid upon his stainless shrines, and countless millions of lips daily repeat the for- mula “I take refuge in Buddha!”"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 The Buddha of this poem — if, as need not be doubted, he really existed — was born on the borders of Nepal about 620 BC., and died about 543 BC. at Kusinagara in Oudh. In point of age, therefore, most other creeds are youthful com- pared with this venerable religion, which has in it the eter- nity of a universal hope, the immortality of a boundless love, an indestructible element of faith in fi nal good, and the proudest assertion ever made of human freedom. The extravagances which disfi gure the record and practice of Buddhism are to be referred to that inevitable degradation which priesthoods always infl ict upon great ideas commit- ted to their charge. The power and sublimity of Gautama’s original doctrines should be estimated by their infl uence; not by their interpreters; nor by that innocent but lazy and ceremonious Church which has arisen on the foundations of the Buddhistic Brotherhood or “Sangha”. I have put my poem into a Buddhist’s mouth, because, to appreciate the spirit of Asiatic thoughts, they should be regarded from the Oriental point of view; and neither the miracles which consecrate this record, nor the philosophy which it embodied, could have been otherwise so naturally produced. The doctrine of Transmigration, so naturally and thoroughly accepted by the Hindus of Buddha’s time; that period when Jerusalem was being taken by Nebuchadnez- zar, when Nineveh was falling to the Medes, and Marseilles was founded by the Phocaeans. The exposition here offered of so antique a system is of necessity incomplete, and — in"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 obedience to the laws of poetic art — passes rapidly by many matters philosophically most important, as well as over the long ministry of Gautama. But my purpose has been obtained if any just conception be here conveyed of the lofty character of this noble prince, and of the general purport of his doctrines. As to these latter there has arisen prodigious controversy among the erudite, who will be aware that I have taken the imperfect Buddhistic citations much as they stand in Spence Hardy’s work, and have also modifi ed more than one passage in the received narratives. The views, how- ever, here indicated of “Nirvana,” “Dharma,” “Karma,” and the other chief features of Buddhism, are at least the fruits of considerable study, and also of a fi rm conviction that a third of mankind would never have been brought to believe in blank abstractions, or in Nothingness as the issue and crown of Being. Finally, in reverence to the illustrious Promulgator of this “ Light of Asia ”, and in homage to the many eminent scholars who have devoted noble labours to his memory, for which both repose and ability are wanting to me, I beg that the shortcomings of my too-hurried study may be forgiven. It has been composed in the brief intervals of days without lei- sure, but is inspired by an abiding desire to aid in the better mutual knowledge of East and West. The time may come, I hope, when this book and my “ Indian Song of Songs ,” and “ Indian Idylls ,” will preserve the memory of one who loved India and the Indian peoples.

So brought she forth her child Pangless — he having on his perfect form The marks, thirty and two, of blessed birth; Of which the great news to the Palace came.

One skinny hand Clutched a worn staff to prop his quavering limbs, And one was pressed upon the ridge of ribs Whence came in gasps the heavy painful breath. “Alms!” moaned he, “give, good people! for I die To-morrow or the next day!” then the cough Choked him, but still he stretched his palm, and stood Blinking, and groaning ’mid his spasms, “Alms!” Then those around had wrenched his feeble feet Aside, and thrust him from the road again, Saying, “The Prince! dost see? get to thy lair!” But that Siddhàrtha cried, “Let be! let be!"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"61 Channa! what thing is this who seems a man, Yet surely only seems, being so bowed, So miserable, so horrible, so sad? Are men born sometimes thus? What meaneth he Moaning ‘to-morrow or next day I die?’ Finds he no food that so his bones jut forth? What woe hath happened to this piteous one?” Then answer made the charioteer, “Sweet Prince! This is no other than an aged man. Some fourscore years ago his back was straight, His eye bright, and his body goodly: now The thievish years have sucked his sap away, Pillaged his strength and fi lched his will and wit; His lamp has lost its oil, the wick burns black; What life he keeps is one poor lingering spark Which fl ickers for the fi nish: such is age; Why should your Highness heed?” Then spake the Prince — “But shall this come to others, or to all, Or is it rare that one should be as he?” “Most noble,” answered Channa, “even as he, Will all these grow if they shall live so long.” “But,” quoth the Prince, “if I shall live as long Shall I be thus; and if Yas ‘ dhara Live fourscore years, is this old age for her, Jàlini, little Hasta, Gautami,"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"62 And Gunga, and the others?” “Yea, great Sir!” The charioteer replied. Then spake the Prince: “Turn back, and drive me to my house again! I have seen that I did not think to see.” Which pondering, to his beauteous Court returned Wistful Siddhàrtha, sad of mien and mood; Nor tasted he the white cakes nor the fruits Spread for the evening feast, nor once looked up While the best palace-dancers strove to charm: Nor spake — save one sad thing — when woefully Yas ‘ dhara sank to his feet and wept, Sighing, “Hath not my Lord comfort in me?” “Ah, Sweet!” he said, “such comfort that my soul Aches, thinking it must end for it will end, And we shall both grow old, Yas ‘ dhara! Loveless, unlovely, weak, and old, and bowed. Nay, though we locked up love and life with lips So close that night and day our breaths grew one Time would thrust in between to fi lch away My passion and thy grace, as black Night steals The rose-gleams from yon peak, which fade to grey And are not seen to fade. This have I found, And all my heart is darkened with its dread,"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"63 And all my heart is fi xed to think how Love Might save its sweetness from the slayer, Time, Who makes men old.” So through that night he sat Sleepless, uncomforted. And all that night The King Suddhodana dreamed troublous dreams. The fi rst fear of his vision was a fl ag Broad, glorious glistening with a golden sun, The mark of Indra; but a strong wind blew, Rending its folds devine, and dashing it Into the dust; where at a concourse came Of shadowy Ones, who took the spoiled silk up And bore it eastward from the city gates. The second fear was ten huge elephants, With silver tusks and feet that shook the earth, Trampling the southern road in mighty march; And he who sat upon the foremost beast Was the King’s son — the others followed him. The third fear of the vision was a car, Shining with blinding light, which four steeds drew, Snorting white smoke and champing fi ery foam; And in the car the Prince Siddhàrtha sat. The fourth fear was a wheel which turned and turned,"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"64 With nave of burning gold and jewelled spokes, And strange things written on the binding tire, Which seemed both fi re and music as it whirled. The fi fth fear was a mighty drum set down Midway between the city and the hills, On which the Prince beat with an iron mace, So that the sound pealed like a thunderstorm, Rolling around the sky and far away. The sixth fear was a tower, which rose and rose High o’er the city till its stately head Shone crowned with clouds and on the top the Prince Stood, scattering from both hands, this way and that, Gems of most lovely light, as if it rained Jacynths and rubies; and the whole world came, Striving to seize those treasures as they fell Towards the four quarters. But the seventh fear was A noise of wailing, and behold six men Who wept and gnashed their teeth, and laid their palms Upon their mouths, walking disconsolate. These seven fears made the vision of his sleep, But none of all his wisest dream-readers Could tell their meaning. Then the King was wroth, Saying, ‘There cometh evil to my house, And none of ye have wit to help me know"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"65 What the great gods portend sending me this.’ So in the city men went sorrowful Because the King had dreamed seven signs of fear Which none could read; but to the gate there came An aged man, in robe of deer-skin clad, By guise a hermit, known to none; he cried, “Bring me before the King, for I can read The vision of his sleep;” who when he heard The sevenfold mysteries of the midnight dream, Bowed reverent and said, “O Maharàj! I hail this favoured House, where shall arise A wider-reaching splendour than the sun’s! Lo! all these seven fears are seven joys, Whereof the fi rst, where thou didst see a fl ag — Broad, glorious, gilt with Indra’s badge — cast down And carried out, did signify the end Of old faiths and beginning of the new; For there is change with gods not less than men, And as the days pass kalpas pass at length. The ten great elephants that shook the earth The ten great gifts of wisdom signify, In strength whereof the Prince shall quit his state And shake the world with passage of the Truth. The fl ame-breathing horses of the car Are those four fearless virtues which shall bring"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"66 The son from doubt and gloom to gladsome light; The wheel that turned with nave of burning gold Was that most precious Wheel of perfect Law Which he shall turn in sight of all the world.

Such is the interpretation of the tower; But for those six men weeping with shut mouths, They are the six chief teachers whom thy son Shall, with bright truth and speech unanswerable, Convince of foolishness. O King! rejoice, The fortune of my Lord the Prince is more Than kingdoms, and his hermit-rags will be Beyond fi ne cloths of gold. This was thy dream! And in seven nights and days these things shall fall.” So spake the holy man, and lowly made The eight prostrations, touching thrice the ground; Then turned and passed; but when the King bade send A rich gift after him, the messengers"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"67 Brought word, “We came to where he entered in At Chandra’s temple, but within was none Save a grey owl which fl uttered from the shrine.” The gods come sometimes thus. But the sad King Marvelled, and gave command that new delights Be compassed to enthral Siddhàrtha’s heart Amid those dancers of his pleasure-house, Also he set at all the brazen doors A doubled guard. Yet who shall shut out Fate! For once again the spirit of the Prince Was moved to see this world beyond his gates, This life of man, so pleasant, if its waves Ran not to waste and woeful fi nishing In Time’s dry sands. “I pray you let me view Our city as it is,” such was his prayer To King Suddhodana. “Your Majesty In tender heed hath warned the folk before To put away ill things and common sights, And make their faces glad to gladden me, And all the causeways gay; yet have I learned This is not daily life, and if I stand"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68 Nearest, my father, to the realm and thee, Fain would I know the people and the streets, Their simple usual ways, and workday deeds, And lives which those men live who are not kings.

Therefore, I pray thee, let me go at will To-morrow, with my servants, through the streets.” And the King said, among his Ministers, “Belike this second fl ight may mend the fi rst. Note how the falcon starts at every sight New from his hood, but what a quite eye Cometh of freedom; let my son see all, And bid them bring me tidings of his mind.” Thus on the morrow, when the noon was come, The Prince and Channa passed beyond the gates, Which opened to the signet of the King; Yet knew not they who rolled the great doors back It was the King’s son in that merchant’s robe, And in the clerkly dress his charioteer.

What grief Springs of itself and springs not of Desire? Senses and things perceived mingle and light Passion’s quick spark of fi re: So fl ameth Trishna , lust and thirst of things.

So, where the grain should grow, Spreads the biràn-weed with its evil root And poisonous blossoms; hardly good seeds fi nd Soil where to fall and shoot; And drugged with poisonous drink the soul departs, And, fi erce with thirst to drink, Karma returns; Sense-struck again the sodden Self begins, And new deceits it earns.

Then Sorrow ends, for Life and Death have ceased; How should lamps fl icker when their oil is spent? The old sad count is clear, the new is clean; Thus hath a man content. The Fourth Truth is The Way . It openeth wide, Plain for all feet to tread, easy and near, The Noble Eightfold Path ; it goeth straight To peace and refuge. Hear!

Have good-will To all that lives, letting unkindness die And greed and wrath; so that your lives be made Like soft airs passing by. The Third is Right Discourse .
