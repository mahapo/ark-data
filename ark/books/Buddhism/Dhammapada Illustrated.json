Its sacred contents have unceasingly influenced human thought, hold- ing aloft the torch of knowledge to light the path of men in their quest for truth and inner solace. In the current global context, The Dhammapada has evolved into the stature of an outstanding treasure of the common human heritage, tran- scending man-made borders and boundaries and rising above limitations imposed by time. The Dhammapada , in short, is among the handful of gems of sacred literature esteemed by people all over the globe, irrespective of cleavages of creed, faith and variegated religious professions. The primary purpose of the present English rendering of The Dhammapada , under the title T h e Tr e a s u r y o f Tr u t h is to take the word of the Buddha further afield, in a verbal and visual idiom that will have greater appeal to the modern mind. The eternal wisdom embodied in the verses of The Dhamma- pada holds within it the potential to bring tranquility to men and women troubled by the stresses and conflicts of life as it is being lived by a good majority of the people in today’s world of disharmony and distress. In spite of the deeply felt need of the contemporary world, to yearn for peace, solace and tran- quility, the word of the Buddha has not generally been pre- sented in a frequency that throbs to the rhythm of the modern mind-set."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"xliv The rationale of the present translation, therefore, is to bring The Dhammapada closer to generations who are being brought up right round the globe on a staple fare of visual messages emanating in multiple colour, from the world’s vis- ual primary media – both of electronic and print categories. In consequence, T h e Tr e a s u r y o f Tr u t h has, as its most prominent core feature a series of 423 specially commissioned illustrations, at the rate of one per stanza in The Dhammapada. This veritable gallery of Dhammapada illustrations is the creation of artist P. Wi c k ra m a n a y a k a , a well-known Sri Lankan professional. He was assisted by artist K. Wi-Jayakeerthi . The illustrations bear witness to the wisdom encapsulated in the Chinese proverb, ‘One picture is worth ten thousand words’. An illustration occupies the left-hand side page of the book. On the opposing page the original story, out of which the verses stem, is recounted. To reinforce the impressions created by the illustration and the verbal narration, ample exegetical material is added. In the section entitled ‘Explana- tory Translation’, the Pàli stanzas are given in their prose- order. The Pàli words are explained and a translation of each verse is presented in an easily assimilable style. Over and above all these, there is a commentary. In this segment of the book, words, phrases, concepts and expres- sions that need further elucidation are accommodated. The structure of the total work is determined wholly and totally by our perception of the need to make the word of the Buddha lucidly and clearly available to all users of this translation of the Dhammapada. With this in mind, we have provided a caption for each illustration which sums up clearly and viv-"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"xlv idly the content of each verse, while providing a guide to the understanding of the significance of the illustration relating to the verse. On the illustration page we have a transliteration of the Pàli stanza in Roman characters. The diacritical marks indi- cate the proper pronunciation of the Pàli words in the stanza. Right in front of the transliteration we have a poetic English rendering of the significance of the Pàli verse. This English version has been produced by Buddhist Bhikkhu Ve n . Khantipalo and Sister Susanna . Together, all these elements make it a unique work, that will ensure the enlightened Dhammapada -understanding not only of the contemporary world, but also of generations to come. The over-riding and consistent measure of this noble publishing endeavour has invariably been the quality and quantum of understanding it will engender in the reader. Each segment of the work is calculated to bring about an esca- lation of the reader’s awareness of what the Buddha said. In effect, the total work strives to approach as close as is possible to the concept the Buddha originally communicated through these timeless stanzas. It may even sound cliché to aver that a monumental work of this scope and magnitude could be anything other than the result of sustained team-work.

Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Maha Nayaka Thero The Eternal Truth revealed by the Exalted Buddha, could be summed up under the four headings: Dukkha (unsatisfactoriness), its cause, the cessation of Dukkha and the way thereto. The Exalted Buddha expounded the Doctrine of these four Great Truths, illustrating and communicating it to suit the mentality of his hearers of wide ranging back- grounds. All his teachings have been grouped into three col- lections – or three Baskets ( Tripitakas ). The three Pitakas are Vinaya, Abhi dhamma and Sutta. The present work, Dhamma- pada, is the second book of the Minor Collection ( Khuddakà- gama ) of the Sutta Pitaka (The Basket of Discourses). It consists of 423 stanzas arranged in 26 Vaggas or Chapters. By reading Dhammapada, one could learn the funda- mentals of the Buddhist way of life. It leads its reader not only to a happy and useful life here and hereafter but also to the achievement of life’s purpose “ Summum Bonum ” the Goal Supreme. Mr. Albert J. Edmonds – author of one of the best English translations of Dhammapada says: “If ever an immor- tal classic was produced upon the continent of Asia – it is the Dhammapada”. In the western world, the Dhammapada was first translated into Latin by Prof. Fausball of Copenhagen. The first English translation was by Prof. Max Muller. Since then many English versions have appeared."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"lii Of all these translations, the present version entitled “Treasury of Truth” has several claims to uniqueness. It is in this version that all of the 423 stanzas have been illustrated. Each of the 423 stanzas has its own especially commissioned illustration. The author of this work – Ven. Weragoda Sarada Maha Thero, is widely known for his efforts to spread the word of the Buddha worldwide. Ven. Sarada – a Buddhist Bhikkhu of indefatigable zeal – has brought out 69 publica- tions on Buddhist themes, to his credit. His recent work “Life of the Buddha in Pictures” has acquired worldwide acclaim. The present work is a monumental publication. The structure of the Treasury of Truth, is highly impres- sive. Here, each stanza is transliterated in Roman characters. The prose order of Pali stanzas is given and the significance of the Pali words is conveyed. The original story – out of which a given stanza stems – is also narrated. Popular trans- lations, exegetical material and a commentary are provided to guide the user. I have the greatest pleasure in describing this work as a great contribution to the world literature of Buddhism and related issues. Not only the contemporary world but even generations to come will profit from this work. Ven.

Weragoda Sarada Maha Thero – Chief Incumbent of the Buddhist Mediation Centre, Singapore – who is the author of “The Treasury of Truth” translation of The Dhammapada. Objectively viewed, the current translation of the Dhamma pada, authored by Ven. W. Sarada Maha Thero, is way ahead of all the other renderings of this great work, for several very important reasons. “The Treasury of Truth”, marks the first-ever occasion when all of the 423 stanzas have been illustrated with pictures especially commissioned for this work. This series of illustrations will have particular appeal to the youthful readers of our day as they are keenly attuned to visual communication. Viewed this way, the present trans- lation of Dhammapada will invariably provide a wholesome sense of direction to those bewildered generations of our time, leading them in the path to higher moral and spiritual achievements. The present work lends itself readily to an in-depth study of this religious classic of mankind, to the great delight of both the scholar and the student."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"liv Ven. Weragoda Sarada Maha Thero – the individual behind this outstanding gift to the world of religion and cul- ture, is a remarkable person endowed with exceptional talents. Spreading the word of the Buddha abroad is his avowed life’s mission.

He has 68 Buddhist books to his credit, and he contin- ues to pursue his publication programme with ever accelerat- ing vigour, for the “greater happiness and the greater well- being of the masses” ( bahujanahitàya , bahujanasukhàya ). My earnest wish is the author of this work, Ven. W. Sarada Maha Thero, may be blessed with long life and sound health enabling him to spread the word of the Buddha far and wide.

On one occasion, Monk Cakkhupàla came to pay hom- age to the Buddha at the Jetavana Monastery. One night, while pacing up and down in meditation, the monk accidentally stepped on some insects. In the morning, some monks visiting the monk found the dead insects. They thought ill of the monk and reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha asked them whether they had seen the monk killing the insects. When they answered in the negative, the Buddha said, “Just as you had not seen him killing, so also he had not seen those living insects. Besides, as the monk had already attained ara- hatship he could have no intention of killing, so he was inno- cent.” On being asked why Cakkhupàla was blind although he was an arahat, the Buddha told the following story: Cakkhupàla was a physician in one of his past exist- ences. Once, he had deliberately made a woman patient blind. That woman had promised to become his slave, together with her children, if her eyes were completely cured. Fearing that she and her children would have to become slaves, she lied to the physician. She told him that her eyes were getting worse when, in fact, they were perfectly cured. The physician knew she was deceiving him, so in revenge, he gave her another ointment, which made her totally blind.

All that we experience begins with thought. Our words and deeds spring from thought. If we speak or act with evil thoughts, unpleasant circumstances and experiences inevita- bly result. Wherever we go, we create bad circumstances because we carry bad thoughts. We cannot shake off this suf- fering as long as we are tied to our evil thoughts. This is very much like the wheel of a cart following the hoofs of the ox yoked to the cart. The cart-wheel, along with the heavy load of the cart, keeps following the draught oxen. The animal is bound to this heavy load and cannot leave it. Commentary The first two verses in the Dhammapada reveal an important concept in Buddhism. When most religions hold it as an important part of"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"61 their dogma that the world was created by a supernatural being called ‘God’, Buddhism teaches that all that we experience (the ‘world’ as well as the ‘self’) is created by thought, or the cognitive process of sense perception and conception. This also proves that writers on Buddhism are mistaken in stating that the Buddha was silent concern- ing the beginning of the world. In the Rohitassa Sutta of the Aõguttara Nikàya , the Buddha states clearly that the world, the beginning of the world, the end of the world, and the way leading to the end of the world, are all in this fathom long body itself with its perceptions and conceptions. The word mano is commonly translated as ‘mind’. But the Buddha takes a phenomenalistic standpoint in the mind-matter controversy that had baffled philosophers throughout history. The duality – ‘mind’ and ‘body’ – is rejected by the Buddha. The Buddha explains in the Sabba Sutta of the Saüyutta Nikàya that all that we can talk about is ‘sense experience’, including thought or conception as the sixth sense. The terms nàma and råpa , commonly translated as ‘mind’ and ‘body’ are not two ‘entities’ that co-exist in relation to each other. They are only two ways of looking at the single ‘activity’ called ‘experience’. Nàma (naming) is ‘experience’ seen subjectively as ‘the mental process of identifying an object’ ( råpa kàye adhivàcana saüpassa ). Råpa (appearance) is ‘experience’ seen objectively as an ‘entity’ that is perceived and conceived through the mental process of identi- fication ( nàma kàye pathigha saüpassa ). Mano refers to ‘thought’ or the mental process of conceptualization, which integrates and makes meaning out of the different percepts brought in through the different senses. This meaningful total ‘experience’ is the dhammà , viewed sub- jectively as ‘identification of an entity’ ( nàma ) and objectively as ‘the entity identified’ ( råpa ). Dhammà which is this “meaningful totality of experience” is normally seen as pleasant or unpleasant circumstance ( loka dhamma )."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"2.

Maññakuõdali was a young Bràhmin, whose father, Adinnapubbaka, was very miserly and never gave anything in charity. Even the gold ornaments for his only son were made by himself to save payment for workmanship. When his son fell ill, no physician was consulted, until it was too late. When he realized that his son was dying, he had the youth carried outside on to the verandah, so that people com- ing to his house would not see his possessions. On that morning, the Buddha arising early from his deep meditation of compassion saw, in his Net of Knowledge, Maññakuõdali lying on the verandah. So when entering Sàvat- thi for alms-food with his disciples, the Buddha stood near the door of the Bràhmin Adinnapubbaka. The Buddha sent forth a ray of light to attract the attention of the youth, who was facing the interior of the house. The youth saw the Buddha; and as he was very weak he could only profess his faith mentally. But that was enough. When he passed away with his heart in devotion to the Buddha he was reborn in the Tàvatiüsa celestial world. From his celestial abode the young Maññakuõdali, see- ing his father mourning over him at the cemetery, appeared to the old man in the likeness of his old self. He told his father"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"64 about his rebirth in the Tàvatiüsa world and also urged him to approach and invite the Buddha to a meal. At the house of Adinnapubbaka the question of whether one could or could not be reborn in a celestial world simply by mentally profess- ing profound faith in the Buddha, without giving in charity or observing the moral precepts, was brought up. So the Buddha invited Maññakuõdali to appear in person; Maññakuõ- dali then appeared in his celestial ornaments and told them about his rebirth in the Tàvatiüsa realm. Only then, the lis- teners became convinced that the son of the Bràhmin Adin- napubbaka, by simply devoting his mind to the Buddha, had attained much glory.

Happiness will always follow him like his shadow that never leaves him. Commentary How we experience our circumstances depends on the way we inter- pret them. If we interpret them in the wrong way, we experience suf- fering. If we interpret them in the right way, we experience happiness. In other words, our happiness or unhappiness depends on the way we think. Thought also creates circumstances in a futuristic sense. If we harbour ill will and speak or act with ill will, people will begin to hate us. We will be punished by society and the law. After death, we will also be reborn in a realm of suffering. Here, ‘thought’ refers to kamma (action) and ‘experience’ refers to vipàka (consequences). The message finally conveyed by this pair of verses is: “Think wrong and suffer. Think right and be happy.” This pair of verses was spoken by the Buddha to show the inevitable consequence ( vipàka ) of good and evil thought ( kamma ). Man reaps what he has sown, both in the past and in the present. What he sows now, he reaps in the present and in the future. Man himself is responsible for his own happiness and misery. He creates his own hell and heaven. He is the architect of his own fate. What he makes he can unmake. Buddhism teaches the way to escape from suffering by understanding and using the law of cause and effect. Buddhism is very realistic and optimistic. Instead of blindly depending on unknown supernatu- ral powers, hoping for happiness, Buddhism finds the true way to happiness realistically."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"3.

Tissa, son of the Buddha’s maternal aunt, was at one time staying with the Buddha. He had become a monk only in his old age, but he posed as a senior monk and was very pleased when visiting monks asked his permission to do some service for him. On the other hand, he failed to perform the duties expected of junior monks; besides, he often quarrelled with the younger monks. Should anyone rebuke him on account of his behaviour, he would go complaining to the Buddha, weep- ing, very much dissatisfied and very upset. Once, the Teacher asked him, “Tissa, why have you come to me so sad and sorrowful with tears in your eyes, weeping?” The other monks had discussed among themselves, “If he goes alone, he may cause trouble.” So they too went along with him, paid obeisance to the Teacher, and sat down respectfully on one side. Tissa answered the Teacher’s question, “Venerable, these monks are abusing me.” The Teacher asked, “But where were you sitting?” “In the centre of the monastery in the Hall of State, Venerable.” “Did you see these monks when they came?” “Yes, Venerable I saw them.” “Did you rise and go to meet them?” “No, Venerable, I did not.” “Did you offer to take their monastic utensils?” “No, Venerable, I did not offer to take them.” “Tissa, do not act thus. You alone are to be blamed; ask their pardon.” “I will not ask their pardon, Venerable.”"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68 The monks said to the Teacher, “He is an obstinate monk, Venerable.” The Teacher replied, “Monks, this is not the first time he has proved obstinate; he was obstinate also in a previ- ous state of existence.” “We know all about his present obsti- nacy, Venerable; but what did he do in a previous state of existence?” “Well then, monks, listen,” said the Teacher. So saying, he told the following story. Once upon a time, when a certain king reigned at Benàres, an ascetic named Devala, who had resided for eight months in the Himàlaya country, desiring to reside near the city during the four months of the rains, for salt and vinegar returned from the Himàlayas. Seeing two boys at the gate of the city, he asked them, “Where do monks who come to this city spend the night?” “In the potter’s hall, Venerable.” So Devala went to the potter’s hall, stopped at the door, and said, “lf it is agreeable to you, Bhaggava, I would like to spend one night in your hall.” The potter turned over the hall to him, saying, “I have no work going on in the hall at night, and the hall is a large one; spend the night here as you please, Vener- able.” No sooner had Devala entered the hall and sat down than another ascetic named Nàrada, returning from the Himàlayas, asked the potter for a night’s lodging. The potter thought to himself, “The ascetic who arrived first may or may not be willing to spend the night with him; I will therefore relieve myself of responsibility.” So he said to the ascetic who had just arrived, “Venera- ble, if the ascetic who arrived first approves of it, spend the night at your pleasure.” So Nàrada approached Devala and said, “Teacher, if it is agreeable to you, I would like to spend one night here.” Devala replied, “The hall is a large one; there-"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"69 fore come in and spend the night on one side.” So Nàrada went in and sat down beside the ascetic who had gone in before him. Both exchanged friendly greetings. When it was bedtime, Nàrada noted carefully the place where Devala lay and the position of the door, and then lay down. But when Devala lay down, instead of lying down in his proper place, he lay down directly across the doorway. The result was that when Nàrada went out at night, he trod on Devala’s matted locks. Thereupon Devala cried out, “Who is treading on my locks?” Nàrada replied, “Teacher, it is I.” “False ascetic,” said Devala, “You come from the forest and tread on my locks.” “Teacher, I did not know that you were lying here; please pardon me.” Nàrada then went out, leaving Devala weeping as if his heart would break. Devala thought to him- self, “I will not let him tread on me when he comes in also.” So he turned around and lay down, placing his head where his feet had been before. When Nàrada came in, he thought to himself, “The first time I injured the teacher; this time I will go in past his feet.” The result was that, when Nàrada entered, he trod on Devala’s neck. Thereupon Devala cried out, “Who is that?” Nàrada replied, “It is I, teacher.” “False ascetic,” said Devala, “The first time you trod on my locks. This time you tread on my neck. I will curse you.” “Teacher, I am not to blame. I did not know that you were lying in this position. When I came in I thought to myself, ‘The first time I injured the teacher; this time I will go in past his feet.’ Please pardon me.” “False ascetic, I will curse you.” “Do not do so, teacher.” But Devala, paying no attention to what Nàrada said, cursed him all the same, saying, “May your head split into seven pieces at sunrise.”"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"4.

When the sun did not rise, the king had to intervene and ask Devala to apologise. Devala refused. Then said Nàrada to Devala, “Teacher, I will put forth my power of meditation and make the sun to rise. At the moment of sun- rise please keep a lump of clay on your head and submerge in water and rise in different places as you go your way.” As soon as the sun’s rays touched the lump of clay on his head, it divided into seven pieces. Thereupon Devala ducked in the water, and came up in a different place, and ran away. When the Buddha had given his instruction, he said, “Monks, at that time the king was ânanda, Devala was Tissa, and Nàrada was myself, when at that time he was obstinate.” The Buddha advised them not to keep thoughts of enmity, for this could be only appeased by thoughts of friendliness.

Living in human society, people often quarrel with one another. When such conflicts occur, people often keep think- ing about the wrongs done to them by others. When that hap- pens, their anger tends to grow. But in those who forgive and forget the wrongs done to them, anger quickly vanishes. They are then at peace. Commentary This pair of verses reveals the psychological principle that is basic to emotional control. Emotion is an excitement of the body that begins with a thought. A thought creates a mental picture which, if held onto, excites a corresponding emotion. It is only when this mental picture is discarded and paid no attention to, that the emotion subsides. The Buddha’s constant advice to His followers was not to retaliate but to practice patience at all times and places, even under provocation. The Buddha praises those who forebear the wrongs of others, even though they have the power to retaliate. In the Dhammapada itself there are many instances that show how the Buddha practiced patience, even when he was severely criticised, abused, and attacked. Patience is not a sign of weakness or defeatism but the unfailing strength of great men and women. The secret of patience is to change the mental picture or how you interpret a situation. An example is given in the Shàntivàdi Jàtaka, where the saint Shàntivàdi was the Buddha Gotama in his former life. The saint kept repeating the thought, “Long live the king may he be free from harm,” while his limbs were severed until death, by this cruel king who wanted to test his patience."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"5.

Once there lived a householder, whose wife was barren. Being unable to bear a child and afraid that she would be mistreated by her husband and her mother-in-law, she arranged for her husband to marry another woman. But on two occasions, as soon as she knew the second wife was preg- nant, the barren wife gave her food mixed with drugs causing her to have a miscarriage. On her third pregnancy, the preg- nant wife kept it to herself without informing the barren wife. But when the latter came to know about it, she again caused an abortion. Eventually the second wife died in childbirth. Before her death, the unfortunate woman was filled with hatred and vowed vengeance on the barren wife and her future offspring. Thus a feud started. Among their later existences the two were reborn as a hen and a female cat; a doe and a leopard; and finally as the daughter of a nobleman in Sàvatthi and a female evil spirit. One day she (Kàli Yakkhinã) was in pursuit of the nobleman’s daughter and her baby.

The Buddha told them about their past trouble as rival wives and how they had been harboring hatred towards each other. They were made to see that hatred could only cause more hatred, and that it could only cease through friendship, understanding, and goodwill. Both realised their mistake, and on the admonition of the Buddha, made their peace with each other. The Buddha then requested the woman to hand over her son to the evil spirit. Fearing for the safety of her son, she hesitated, but because of her devotion and confidence in the Buddha she did hand over her son. The child was warmly received by the evil spirit. After kissing and caressing the child tenderly like her own son, she handed back the child to his mother. As a result, there was no more hatred.

The monks of Kosambi had formed into two groups. One group followed the master of Vinaya and the other fol- lowed the teacher of the Dhamma. Once they were quarrel- ling among themselves over a minor Vinaya rule. Even the Buddha could not stop them from quarrelling; so he left them and spent the vassa, religious retreat in the monsoon season, all alone in Rakkhita Grove near Pàrileyyaka forest. There, the elephant Pàrileyya waited upon the Buddha. The lay disciples of Kosambi, on learning the reason for the departure of the Buddha, refused to make offerings to the remaining monks. This made them realize their mistake and reconciliation took place among themselves. Still, the lay dis- ciples would not treat them as respectfully as before, until they owned up their fault to the Buddha. But the Buddha was away and it was in the middle of the vassa; so the monks of Kosambi spent the vassa in misery and hardship. At the end of the vassa, the Venerable ânanda and many monks approached the Buddha and gave the message from Anàthapiõóika and other lay disciples imploring him to return.

Most of us are not willing to face the reality of impermanence and death. It is because we forget this fact that our lives are tran- sitory, that we quarrel with each other, as if we are going to live for ever. But, if we face the fact of death, our quarrels will come to an end. We will then realize the folly of fighting when we ourselves are doomed to die. Excited by emotions our thought being clouded, we cannot see the truth about life. When we see the truth, however, our thoughts become free of emotions. Commentary The essence of Buddhism is facing the reality of death and imperma- nence. Why we suffer is because we run away from reality, carried away by emotions. Emotions are in conflict with reality; therefore, they are bound to be thwarted by reality. Not only anger but all self- centred emotions come to an end when we face the reality of death. It is a realistic thought that ends all unhappiness. Those who do not face reality in this Buddhist way, continue to be frustrated and angry, and suffer in consequence."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"80 Generally, people are not aware that death will overtake them one day. They act unmindful of this universal truth. Both monks and laymen, unmindful of death and considering themselves as immor- tals, are often heedless in cultivating virtues. They engage themselves in strife and arguments and are often dejected, with their hopes and aspirations shattered. At times, they postpone their work with the hope of doing it on a grand scale in the future, and end up without being able to do anything. Therefore, it is only proper that one should daily reflect on death. Being mindful of death is central to the Buddhist way of under- standing the real nature of life. There are people in this world, people in various walks of life, who resent the very word ‘death’, let alone reflect on it. Infatuated by long life, good health, youth and prosperity, they completely forget the fact that they are subject to death. Immersed in the evanescent pleasures of the five-fold senses, they seek only material satisfaction in this world, completely disregarding a future life, and indulging in vice through the mind, body and speech. They regard this impermanent and evanescent life as permanent and ever- lasting. It is to arouse a sense of dissatisfaction in such blind and igno- rant people, to allay the pangs of sorrow caused by the separation of parents and children, and from wealth and property, to inculcate the doctrine of impermanence in all beings, and thereby convince them of the unsatisfaction of life, and direct them towards the attainment of everlasting peace, that the Buddha preached these words. A person who has not comprehended the doctrine of the Buddha is infatuated by long life and considers himself as immortal, even though he may see many deaths around him; he is infatuated by good health and considers himself free from disease even though he may see countless diseased persons around him; he is infatuated by youth even though he may see many aged persons and considers him- self as one who is not subjected to old age; he is infatuated by wealth and prosperity even though he may see countless persons rendered destitute through loss of wealth; and he never thinks for a moment, that he too, might be subjected to such a state."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"7.

For Cålakàla, Majjhima Kàla, and Mahàkàla were three householders who lived in Setavya, and they were brothers. Cålakàla and Mahàkàla, the oldest and youngest respectively, used to travel abroad with their cara- van of five hundred carts and bring home goods to sell, and Majjhima Kàla sold the goods they brought. Now on a certain occasion the two brothers, taking wares of various kinds in their five hundred carts, set out for Sàvatthi, and halting between Sàvatthi and Jetavana, unharnessed their carts. In the evening Mahàkàla saw Noble Disciples, residents of Sàvat- thi, with garlands and perfumes in their hands, going to hear the Law. “Where are they going?” he asked. Receiving the answer that they were going to hear the Law, he thought to himself, “I will go too.” So he addressed his youngest brother, “Dear brother, keep watch over the carts; I am going to hear the Law.” So saying, he went and paid obeisance to the Buddha and sat down in the outer circle of the congregation. On that day the Teacher preached the Law in orderly sequence with reference to Mahàkàla’s disposition of mind, and quoting the Sutta on the Aggregate of Suffering, and other Suttas, discoursed on the sinfulness and folly and con- tamination of sensual pleasures. Mahàkàla, after listening to"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"83 the discourse, became a monk under the Teacher. Cålakàla likewise became a monk. But the thought in Cålakàla’s mind was, “After a time I will return to the world and take my brother with me.” Somewhat later Mahàkàla made his full profession, and approaching the Teacher, asked him, “How many duties are there in this Religion?” The Teacher informed him that there were two. Said Mahàkàla, “Venerable, since I became a monk in old age, I shall not be able to fulfill the Duty of Study, but I can fulfill the Duty of Contemplation.” So he had the Teacher instruct him in the Practice of meditation in a cemetery, which leads to Arahatship. At the end of the first watch, when every- one else was asleep, he went to the cemetery; and at dawn, before anyone else had risen, he returned to the Monastery. Now a certain young woman of station was attacked by a disease, and the very moment the disease attacked her, she died, in the evening, without a sign of old age or weakness. In the evening her kinsfolk and friends brought her body to the burning-ground, with firewood, oil, and other requisites, and said to the keeper of the burning-ground, “Burn this body.” And paying the keeper the usual fee, they turned the body over to her and departed. When the keeper of the burning- ground removed the woman’s dress and beheld her beautiful golden-hued body, she straightway thought to herself, “This corpse is a suitable Subject of Meditation to show to His rever- ence.” So she went to the Venerable, paid obeisance to him, and said, “I have a remarkably good Subject of Meditation; pray look at it, Venerable.” “Very well,” said the Venerable. So he went and caused the dress which covered the corpse to be"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"84 removed, and surveyed the body from the soles of the feet to the tips of the hair. Then he said, “Throw this beautiful golden- hued body into the fire, and as soon as the tongues of fire have laid hold of it, please tell me.” So saying, he went to his own place and sat down. The keeper of the burning-ground did as she was told and went and informed the Venerable. The Venerable came and surveyed the body. Where the flames had touched the flesh, the colour of her body was like that of a mottled cow; the feet stuck out and hung down; the hands were curled back; the forehead was without skin. The Vener- able thought to himself, “This body, which but now caused those who looked thereon to forget the Sacred Word, has but now attained decay, has but now attained death.” And going to his night-quarters, he sat down, discerning clearly Decay and Death. Mahàkàla developed Spiritual Insight and attained Arahatship, together with the Supernatural Faculties. When Mahàkàla attained Arahatship, the Buddha, sur- rounded by the Congregation of Monks, travelling from place to place, arrived at Setavya and entered the Simsapà forest. Cålakàla’s wives, hearing that the Buddha had arrived, thought to themselves, “Now we shall recover our husband.” So they went and invited the Buddha. Now when a visit is expected from the Buddha, it is customary for a single monk to go in advance and give warning. When Cålakàla went home to prepare for alms-giving his wives tore off his robes. Mahàkàla’s eight wives also thought that they would get their husband to give up the robes. One day, they arranged an alms-giving for the Buddha and the Disciples and asked the Buddha to leave Mahàkàla behind to pronounce the formula"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"85 of thanksgiving after alms-giving. The Buddha left him at his former home and went away with the other disciples.

Yester- day Cålakàla came and that was the end of his monastic life. But today, a different monk came and nothing of the sort hap- pened.” The Buddha sent Mahàkàla back and continued on his way. Said the monks, “The monk Mahàkàla is virtuous and upright. Will they put an end to his monastic life?” Mahàkàla’s wives tried to make him a layman but he rose into the air through his psychic power as an Arahat and appeared before the Buddha as he was reciting these two verses. Monk Mahàkàla paid obeisance to the Buddha and the Buddha told the other monks that they were wrong about Arahat Mahàkàla to compare him with Monk Cålakàla.

As a result, they become attached to things and call them “this is mine” or “this is myself”. When these things to which they are attached change and are parted from them, they lament that what is “theirs” and what is “themselves” is break- ing up and dying. Those who look at the unpleasant side of life, the thorns in the roses, have their attachments weaken. When this hap- pens, the change and separation from attached objects do not bring about much sorrow or grief. Asubhànupassanà : does not mean the reflection on the pain- fulness of pain which produces hatred or aversion. That is called the cultivation of ‘the perception of repulsiveness’ ( pañhigha sa¤¤à ), which is also to be avoided. Its true meaning is the reflection on the bad side of sensual pleasure, which people often like to ignore, and in so doing, run into suffering, the very thing that they are trying to avoid. True optimism is not a one-sided view of life but an abil- ity to see a solution to the problems in life. This is the optimism of Buddhism. This pair of verses reveals the method of finding happiness in life, by giving up attachment to things of the world. The first step is to think realistically. Guarding the senses is learning to stop reacting to pleasant and unpleasant circumstances with desire and aversion. Exercising control in our eating habits and overcoming laziness are necessary to maintain the practice of focusing atten- tion on right things and thereby clearing the thoughts of emotional attachments."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"9.

For on a certain occasion the two Chief Disciples, each with a retinue of five hundred monks, took leave of the Buddha and went from Jetavana to Ràjagaha. The residents of Ràjag- aha united in twos and threes and in larger groups gave alms in accordance with the custom of giving alms to visi- tors. Now one day Venerable Sàriputta said, in making the Address of Thanksgiving, “Lay brethren, one man himself gives alms, but does not urge another to give; that man receives in future births the blessing of wealth, but not the blessing of a retinue. Another man urges his neighbour to give, but does not himself give; that man receives in future births the blessing of a retinue, but not the blessing of wealth. Another man neither himself gives alms nor urges others to give; in future births that man receives not so much as a bel- lyful of sour rice-gruel, but is forlorn and destitute. Yet another both himself gives alms and urges his neighbour to give; that man, in future births in a hundred states of exist- ence, in a thousand states of existence, in a hundred thou- sand states of existence, receives both the blessing of wealth and the blessing of a retinue.” Thus did Venerable Sàriputta preach the law."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"91 One person invited the Venerable to take a meal with him, saying, “Venerable, accept my hospitality for tomorrow.” For the alms-giving someone handed over a piece of cloth, worth one hundred thousand, to the organizers of the alms giving ceremony.

It so happened that there was no shortage of anything and the cloth was to be offered to one of the monks. Since the two Chief Disciples visited Ràjagaha only occasionally, the cloth was offered to Devadatta, who was a permanent resident of Ràjagaha. It came about this way. Some said, “Let us give it to the Venerable Sàriputta.” Others said, “The Venerable Sàriputta has a way of coming and going. But Devadatta is our constant companion, both on festival days and on ordinary days, and is ever ready like a water-pot. Let us give it to him.” After a long discussion it was decided by a majority of four to give the robe to Devadatta. So they gave the robe to Devadatta. Devadatta cut it in two, fashioned it, dyed it, put one part on as an undergarment and the other as an upper gar- ment, and wore it as he walked about. When they saw him wearing his new robe, they said, “This robe does not befit Devadatta, but does befit the Venerable Sàriputta. Devadatta is going about wearing under and upper garments which do not befit him.” Said the Buddha, “Monks, this is not the first time Devadatta has worn robes unbecoming to him; in a pre- vious state of existence also he wore robes which did not befit him.” So saying, he related the following."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"92 Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta ruled at Benàres, there dwelt at Benàres a certain elephant-hunter who made a living by killing elephants. Now in a certain forest several thousand elephants found pasture. One day, when they went to the forest, they saw some Private Buddhas. From that day, both going and coming, they fell down on their knees before the Private Buddha before proceeding on their way. One day the elephant-hunter saw their actions. Thought he, “I too ought to get a yellow robe immediately.” So he went to a pool used by a certain Private Buddha, and while the lat- ter was bathing and his robes lay on the bank, stole his robes. Then he went and sat down on the path by which the elephants came and went, with a spear in his hand and the robe drawn over his head. The elephants saw him, and taking him for a Private Buddha, paid obeisance to him, and then went their way. The elephant which came last of all he killed with a thrust of his spear. And taking the tusks and other parts which were of value and burying the rest of the dead animal in the ground, he departed. Later on the Future Buddha, who had been reborn as an elephant, became the leader of the elephants and the lord of the herd. At that time also the elephant-hunter was pursuing the same tactics as before. The Buddha observed the decline of his retinue and asked, “Where do these elephants go that this herd has become so small?” “That we do not know, mas- ter.” The Buddha thought to himself, “Wherever they go, they must not go without my permission.” Then the suspicion entered his mind, “The fellow who sits in a certain place with"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"93 a yellow robe drawn over his head must be causing the trou- ble; he will bear watching.” So the leader of the herd sent the other elephants on ahead and walking very slowly, brought up the rear himself. When the rest of the elephants had paid obeisance and passed on, the elephant-hunter saw the Buddha approach, where- upon he gathered his robe together and threw his spear. The Buddha fixed his attention as he approached, and stepped backwards to avoid the spear. “This is the man who killed my elephants,” thought the Buddha, and forthwith sprang for- wards to seize him. But the elephant-hunter jumped behind a tree and crouched down. Thought the Buddha, “I will encir- cle both the hunter and the tree with my trunk, seize the hunter, and dash him to the ground.” Just at that moment the hunter removed the yellow robe and allowed the elephant to see it. When the Great Being saw it, he thought to himself, “If I offend against this man, the reverence which thousands of Buddhas, Private Buddhas, and Arahats feel towards me will of necessity be lost.” Therefore he kept his patience. Then he asked the hunter, “Was it you that killed all these kinsmen of mine?” “Yes, master,” replied the hunter. “Why did you do so wicked a deed? You have put on robes which become those who are free from the passions, but which are unbecoming to you. In doing such a deed as this, you have committed a griev- ous sin.” So saying, he rebuked him again for the last time. “Unbecoming is the deed you have done,” said he.

The robe signifies the Sangha which is a part of the Holy Trinity of the Buddhist: Buddha , Dhamma and Sangha . When a person is ordained as a Buddhist monk, the person feels that he has risen above the mundane realm and become a holy person. This feeling is reinforced when laymen bow down before him. This new ‘self-image’ helps the newly ordained person to start a new life of holiness. The layman too gets inspiration by seeing and wor- shiping the wearer of the robe. This veneration of the robe, therefore, is an important part of the Buddhist practice. This is why a person contaminated by profanity is not worthy of the yellow cloth.

On the day appointed for the name of the children, they gave the name Upatissa to the son of the brahamin woman whose name was Sàri, because he was the son of the principal family in Upatissa village; to the other boy, because he was the son of the principal family in Kolita village, they gave the name Kolita. As they grew up, both boys attained the highest proficiency in all the arts and sciences. Whenever the youth Upatissa went to the river or the garden to enjoy himself, five hundred golden litters accompanied him; five hundred chari-"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"99 ots drawn by thoroughbreds accompanied the youth Kolita. The two youths had retinues of five hundred boys apiece. Now there is a festival celebrated every year in Ràjagaha which goes by the name of Mountain-top festival. A couch for the two youths was set up in one place, and the two youths sat together and witnessed the passing show. When there was occasion to laugh, they laughed; when there was occasion to weep, they wept; when it was time to give alms, they gave alms. In this way they witnessed the festivities for several days. But one day, when they had grown wiser, there was no laugh when they might have laughed, as on preceding days, there were no tears when they might have wept, and when their alms were sought they gave no alms. The following thought, we are told, occurred to the two youths, “Why should we look at this? Before a hundred years have passed, all these people will have gone hence and will no more be seen. It behoves us rather to seek the Way of Release.” And taking this thought to heart, they sat down. Then Kolita said to Upatissa, “Friend Upatissa, you do not appear to be pleased and delighted as on previous days. Nay rather, you are afflicted with melancholy. What is in your mind?” “Friend Kolita, I sit thinking, ‘There is no lasting satisfaction in look- ing upon these folk; this is all unprofitable; it behoves me rather to seek the Way of Release for myself’. But why are you melancholy?” Kolita said the same thing. When Upatissa dis- covered that Kolita’s thoughts were one with his own, he said, “Both of us have had a happy thought. It behoves us both to seek the Way of Release and to retire from the world together. Under what teacher shall we retire from the world?” Now at this time a wandering ascetic named Sanjaya"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"100 entered the city of Ràjagaha, accompanied by a large retinue of wandering ascetics. “We will retire from the world and become monks under Sanjaya,” said Upatissa and Kolita. So they dismissed five hundred retainers, saying to them, “Take the litters and the chariots and go,” and, together with the remaining five hundred, retired from the world and became monks under Sanjaya. From the day when these two youths retired from the world and became monks under Sanjaya, Sanjaya reached the pinnacle of gain and renown. In but a few days they had passed the bounds of Sanjaya’s teaching. Therefore they asked him, “Teacher, is this all the religious truth you know, or is there something more besides?” “This is all there is; you know all.” The questions Upatissa and Kolita asked, the others, too, were not able to answer; but every question the others asked, Upatissa and Kolita answered. In this manner they travelled over the Land of the Rose-apple; then they retraced their steps and returned to their own homes again. Before they separated, Upatissa said to Kolita, “Friend Kolita, whichever of us first attains the Deathless is to inform the other.” Having made this agreement, they separated. One day, the wandering ascetic Upatissa saw the Monk Assaji. Upatissa said to him, “Calm and serene, brother, are your organs of sense; clean and clear is the hue of your skin. For whose sake, brother, did you retire from the world? And who is your teacher? And whose doctrine do you profess?” “Brother, I am as yet a mere novice; its not long since I have been a monk; but recently did I approach Buddha’s doctrine and discipline.” Said the ascetic, I am Upatissa; say much or little according to your ability; I will understand the meaning"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"101 in a hundred ways or a thousand ways.” At what Monk Assaji said Upatissa received higher excellence. Upatissa next saw his friend Kolita and informed him that he had attained deathless. He pronounced the same stanza Assaji had pro- nounced. Kolita was established in the fruit of conversion. They decided to visit the Buddha. They thought they should ask their former instructor Sanjaya to join them. “You may go; I cannot come,” Sanjaya said, “In the past I have gone about as a teacher of the multitude. For me to become a pupil again would be absurd.” “Do not act thus, teacher,” Upatissa said. “Teacher, from the moment of the Buddha’s appearance in the world the populace has adored Him. Let’s also go there. What do you intend to do now?” Sanjaya replied, “Friends, which are more numerous in this world, the stupid or the wise?” “Teacher, the stupid are many, the wise are few.” Sanjaya said: “Well then, friends, let the wise men go to the wise Monk Gotama and let the stupid come to stupid me.” Upatissa and Kolita departed. About two hundred and fifty wandering ascetics of Sanjaya’s group also joined the two friends. Then Kolita and Upatissa saw the Buddha and became his chief disciples. Upatissa became Sàriputta, and Kolita became Moggallàna. They informed the Buddha how Sanjaya would not come to see the Buddha.

Our sense of values is what gives direction to our lives. The purity and richness of our lives depend on our sense of values.

Venerable Kàludàyi, knowing that it was the proper time for the Buddha to go to see his father, described the beauty of the journey and conducted the Buddha with his retinue of many Arahats to Kapilapura. And there, in the company of his kinsfolk, the Buddha, taking a shower of rain for his text, related the Vessantara Jàtaka. On the following day he entered the city for alms. By the recita- tion of the Stanza, “A man should exert himself and should not live the life of Heedlessness,” he established his father in the Fruit of Conversion; and by the recitation of the Stanza, “A man should live righteously,” he established Mahà Pajàpati in the Fruit of Conversion and his father in the Fruit of the Second Path. On the following day, while the ceremonies of Prince Nanda’s sprinkling, house-warming, and marriage were in progress, the Buddha entered the house for alms, placed his bowl in Prince Nanda’s hands, and wished him good luck. Then, rising from his seat, He departed without taking his bowl from the hands of the Prince. Out of reverence for the Buddha, Prince Nanda did not dare say, “Venerable, receive your bowl,” but thought within himself, “He will take his bowl at the head of the stairs.” But even when the Buddha reached the head of the stairs, He did not take his bowl. Thought Nanda, “He will take his bowl at the foot of the stairs.” But the Buddha did not take his bowl even there."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"106 Thought Nanda, “He will take his bowl in the palace court.” But the Buddha did not take his bowl even there. Prince Nanda desired greatly to return to his bride, and followed the Buddha much against his own will. But so great was his rev- erence for the Buddha that he did not dare say, “Receive your bowl,” but continued to follow the Buddha, thinking to him- self, “He will take his bowl here! He will take his bowl there! He will take his bowl there!” At that moment they brought word to his bride Jana- pada-Kalyàni belle-of-the-country, “My lady, the Exalted One (Buddha) has taken Prince Nanda away with him; it is his purpose to deprive you of him.” Thereupon Janapada-Kalyàni, with tears streaming down her face and hair half-combed, ran after Prince Nanda as fast as she could and said to him, “Noble sir, please return immediately.” Her words caused a quaver in Nanda’s heart; but the Buddha, without so much as taking his bowl, led him to the Monastery and said to him, “Nanda, would you like to become a monk?” So great was Prince Nanda’s reverence for the Buddha that he refrained from saying, “I do not wish to become a monk,” and said instead, “Yes, I should like to become a monk.” Said the Buddha, “Well then, make a monk of Nanda.” Thus it hap- pened that on the third day after the Buddha’s arrival at Kapi- lapura he caused Nanda to become a monk. While the Buddha was thus residing at Jetavana, Vener- able Nanda, becoming discontented, told his troubles to the monks, saying, “Brethren, I am dissatisfied. I am now living the religious life, but I cannot endure to live the Religious Life any longer.

Why cannot you endure to live the Religious Life any longer? Why do you intend to abandon the higher precepts and to return to the lower life, the life of a layman?” “Venerable, when I left my house, my noble wife Janapada- Kalyàni, with hair half-combed, took leave of me, saying, ‘Noble sir, please return immediately.’ Venerable, it is because I keep remembering her that I am dissatisfied with the reli- gious life I am now living; that I cannot endure to live the religious life any longer; that I intend to abandon the higher precepts and to return to the lower life, the life of a layman.” Then the Exalted One took Venerable Nanda by the arm, and by his power conducted him to the World of the Thirty-three. On the way the Buddha pointed out to Venerable Nanda in a certain burnt field, seated on a burnt stump, a greedy monkey which had lost her ears and nose and tail in a fire. When they reached the World of the Thirty-three, he pointed out five hundred pink-footed celestial nymphs who came to wait upon Sakka, king of the gods. And when the Buddha had shown Venerable Nanda these two sights, he asked him this question, “Nanda, which do you regard as being the more beautiful and fair to look upon and handsome, your noble wife Janapada-Kalyàni or these five hundred pink- footed celestial nymphs?” “ Ve ne rable,” r e pl ie d Na nd a, “a s fa r i n fe r ior a s t h i s g r e e dy monkey which has lost her ears and nose and tail is to Jana- pada-Kalyàni, even so far inferior, Venerable, is my noble wife"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"108 Janapada-Kalyàni to these five hundred pink-footed celestial nymphs.” “Cheer up, Nanda!” replied the Exalted One. “I guaran- tee that you will win these five hundred pink-footed celestial nymphs.” Said Venerable Nanda, “If, Venerable, the Buddha guarantees that I shall win these five hundred pink-footed celestial nymphs in that case, Reverend Sir, I shall take the greatest pleasure in living the exalted life of a religious man.” Now Venerable Nanda, although his fellow-monks despised him for striving to seek celestial nymphs, was nev- ertheless, living in solitude, withdrawn from the world, heed- ful, ardent, resolute, in no long time, even in this life, attained the supreme goal of the religious life. This did he know: “Birth is at an end, lived is the holy life, duty is done: I am no more for this world.” And there was yet another venerable elder numbered among the Arahats. In the course of the night Venerable Nanda approached the Buddha, and spoke as follows, “Venerable, I release the Buddha from the promise which he made when he guaran- teed that I should win five hundred pink-footed celestial nymphs.” The Buddha replied, “Nanda, I myself grasped your mind with my own mind.” The monks started saying, “On former days he used to say, ‘I am dissatisfied,’ but now says, ‘I am in no wise inclined to the life of a layman.’” And forthwith they went and reported the matter to the Buddha.

Commentary The terms ‘ citta ’ and ‘ mano ’ are loosely translated by writers on Buddhism as if they were synonymous and interchangeable. Both words are usually translated as ‘mind’. Buddhism does not recognize an entity called ‘mind’ or a ‘mind-body’ duality. Buddhism, however, recognizes the cognitive ( Mano ) and affective ( citta ) processes of psychophysical activity, which may be seen objectively as physical and subjectively as mental. The term ‘ citta ’ in these verses may also refer to the affective process which may be more appropriately termed ‘temperament’. The term ‘ bhàvanà ’ is also usually translated as ‘meditation’. But the term ‘ bhàvanà ’ is more meaningfully translated as ‘culture’. Bhàvanà is the culture and development of the cognitive and affective processes that lead to good behaviour and happiness."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"15.

So cruel and savage a being has never been seen before.” Said the Buddha, “Monks, he has not been killing pigs these seven days. Retribution in keeping with his past deeds has overtaken him. Even while he yet remained alive, the tor- ment of the realm of suffering rose up before him. By reason of this torment he crawled hither and thither in his house for seven days, grunting and squealing like a pig.

If that is the case, there is no benefit in leading a religious life, nor is there any opportunity to work for one’s emancipation. In this pair of verses, suffering and happiness in the next world are also indicated. Buddhists do not believe that this life on earth is the only life and that human beings are the only kind of being. Planes of existence are numerous and beings are innumerable. After death one may be born as a human being, in a subhuman state or in a celestial plane according to one’s actions.

He generously offered food and other requisites to the monks regularly and also on special occasions. He was, in fact, the leader of five hundred virtuous lay disciples of the Buddha who lived in Sàvatthi. Dhammika had seven sons and seven daughters and all of them, like their father, were virtuous and devoted to charity. When Dhammika was very ill and was on his death-bed he made a request to the Sangha to come to his bedside and recite the sacred texts. While the monks were reciting the Mahàsatipaññhana Sutta, six deco- rated chariots from six celestial worlds arrived to invite him to their respective worlds. Dhammika told them to wait for a while for fear of interrupting the recitation of the Sutta. The monks, thinking that they were being asked to stop, stopped and left the place. A little while later, Dhammika told his children about the six decorated chariots waiting for him. Then and there he decided to choose the chariot from the Tusita world and asked one of his children to throw a garland on to it.

Thus, the virtuous man rejoices in this world as well as in the next. When those monks reached the Monastery, the Buddha asked them, “Monks, did the lay disciple hear the Dhamma?” “Yes, Venerable. But in the midst of the recitation he cried out, ‘Wait! Wait!’ and stopped us. Then his sons and daughters began to weep, whereupon we departed.” “Monks, he was not talking to you.

And this he did because he became aware of the following, “If he shall remain a layman and not be received into the Order as a monk, inasmuch as he has been guilty of grievous crimes, it will be impossible for him to look forward with confidence to future existence; but if he shall become a monk, no mat- ter how grievous the crimes he has committed, it will be possible for him to look forward with confidence to future existence.” In the far future, according to this tradition, he will become a solitary Buddha ( Pacceka Buddha ) named Aññissara."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"18.

For at Sàvatthi lived two young men of noble family who were inseparable friends. On a certain occasion they went to the Monastery, heard the Teacher preach the Law, renounced the pleasures of the world, yielded the mind to the Religion of the Buddha, and became monks. When they had kept residence for five years with preceptors and teachers, they approached the Teacher and asked about the Duties in his Religion. After listening to a detailed description of the Duty of Meditation and of the Duty of Study, one of them said, “Venerable, since I became a monk in old age, I shall not be able to fulfill the Duty of Study, but I can fulfill the Duty of Meditation.” So he had the Teacher instruct him in the Duty of Meditation as far as Arahatship, and after striving and struggling attained Arahatship, together with the Supernatu- ral Faculties. But the other said, I will fulfill the Duty of Study,” acquired by degrees the Tipitaka , the Word of the Buddha, and wherever he went, preached the Law and intoned it. He went from place to place reciting the Law to five hundred monks, and was preceptor of eighteen large communities of monks. Now a company of monks, having obtained a Formula of Meditation from the Teacher, went to the place of residence of the older monk, and by faithful observance of his admoni- tions attained Arahatship. Thereupon, they paid obeisance to the Venerable and said, “We desire to see the Teacher.” Said"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"129 the Venerable, “Go, brethren, greet in my name the Buddha, and likewise greet the eighty Chief Venerables, and greet my fellow-elder, saying, ‘Our teacher greets you.’” So those monks went to the Monastery and greeted the Buddha and the Ven- erables, saying, “Venerable, our teacher greets you.” When they greeted their teacher’s fellow-elder, he replied, “Who is he?” Said the monks, “He is your fellow-monk, Venerable.” Said the younger monk, “But what have you learned from him? Of the Dãgha Nikàya and the other Nikàyas, have you learned a single Nikàya? Of the Three Pitakas, have you learned a single Pitaka?” And he thought to himself, “This monk does not know a single stanza containing four verses. As soon as he became a monk, he took rags from a dust-heap, entered the forest, and gathered a great many pupils about him. When he returns, it behoves me to ask him some ques- tion.” Now somewhat later the older monk came to see the Buddha, and leaving his bowl and robe with his fellow-elder, went and greeted the Buddha and the eighty Chief Venerables, afterwards returning to the place of residence of his fellow-elder. The younger monk showed him the customary attentions, pro- vided him with a seat of the same size as his own, and then sat down, thinking to himself, “I will ask him a question.” At that moment the Buddha thought to Himself, “Should this monk annoy this my son, he is likely to be reborn in Hell.” So out of compassion for him, pretending to be going the rounds of the monastery, He went to the place where the two monks were sitting and sat down on the Seat of the Buddha already prepared.

And when He had sat down, He asked the monk who had taken upon himself the Duty of Study a ques- tion on the First Trance. When the younger monk had answered this question correctly, the Teacher, beginning with the Second Trance, asked him questions about the Eight Attainments and about Form and the Formless World, all of which he answered correctly. Then the Teacher asked him a question about the Path of Conversion; he was unable to answer it. Thereupon, the Buddha asked the monk who was an Arahat, and the latter immediately gave the correct answer. “Well done, well done, monk!” said the Teacher, greatly pleased. The Teacher then asked questions about the remain- ing Paths in order. The monk who had taken upon himself the Duty of Study was unable to answer a single question, while the monk who had attained unto Arahatship answered every question He asked. On each of four occasions the Buddha bestowed applause on him. Hearing this, all the dei- ties, from the gods of earth to the gods of the World of Brahma, including Nàgas and Garudàs, shouted their applause. Hearing this applause, the pupils and fellow-residents of the younger monk were offended at the Buddha and said, “Why did the Buddha do this? He bestowed applause on each of four occasions on the old monk who knows nothing at all. But to our own teacher, who knows all the Sacred Word by heart and is at the head of five hundred monks, he gave no praise at all.” The Teacher asked them, “Monks, what is it you are talking about?” When they told Him, He said, “Monks, your own teacher is in my Religion like a man who tends cows for hire. But my son is like a master who enjoys the five products of the cow at his own good pleasure.”"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"131 Explanatory Translation (Verse 19) pamatto naro sahitaü bahuü bhàsamàno api ce takkaro na hoti paresaü gàvo ganayaü gopo iva sàma¤¤assa bhàgavà na hoti . pamatto : slothful; naro : person; sahitaü : the Buddha’s word; bahuü : extensively; bhàsamàno : recites; api : though; ce : yet; takkaro : behaving accordingly; na hoti : does not become; paresaü : of others; gàvo : cattle; ganayaü : protect- ing; gopo iva : cowherd like; sàma¤¤assa : the renounced life; bhàgavà na hoti : does not partake of.

The fulfillment of religious life is ensured only if the person organizes his life according to what has been said by the Buddha. The effort of the person who merely recites the word of the Buddha is as futile as the activity of the cowherd who takes the trouble to count others’ cattle while the dairy products are enjoyed by someone else – the owner.

There lived in the city of Bhaddàvati a treasurer named Bhaddavatiya, and he was a friend of the treasurer Ghosaka, although Ghosaka had never seen him. For the treasurer Ghosaka heard, from traders who came from the city of Bhad- dàvati, of the wealth and age of the treasurer Bhaddavatiya, and desiring to be friends with him, sent him a present. Thus, although neither had seen the other, they dwelt as friends. After a time, an intestinal disease broke out in the house of the treasurer Bhaddavatiya. When this disease breaks out, the first to die are flies; afterwards, in regular order, insects, mice, domestic fowls, swine, cattle, slaves both female and male, and last of all the members of the household. Only those that break down the wall and flee, save their lives. Now at that time the treasurer Bhaddavatiya and his wife and daugh- ter fled in this manner, and intending to seek the treasurer Ghosaka, set out on the road to Kosambi. While they were still on their way, their provisions for the journey gave out, and their bodies became exhausted from exposure to wind and sun, and from hunger and thirst. Reaching Kosambi with difficulty, they bathed in a pool of water in a pleasant place and then entered a certain rest house at the gate of the city. Then the treasurer said to his wife, “Wife, those who travel this way are not courteous even to a mother who has"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"137 borne a child.

We will send our daughter there, have her bring us food, remain right here for a day or two and refresh our bodies, and then we will go and see my friend.” “Very well, husband,” she replied, and they took up their residence right there in the rest house. On the following day, when meal-time was announced and the blind, the poor, and other unfortunate persons went to obtain food, the mother and father sent forth their daughter, saying, “Daughter, go bring us food.” So the daughter of a wealthy house, pride overcome with misfortune, hid her shame, took a bowl, and went to the poor folk to procure food. “How many portions will you have?” she was asked. “Three,” she replied. So they gave her three portions. She carried the food back to her parents, and the three sat down to eat together. The mother and daughter said to the treasurer, “Master, mis- fortune comes even to prominent families. Eat without regard- ing us and do not worry.” After a good deal of urging, they prevailed upon him to eat. But after he had eaten, he was unable to digest his food, and when the sun rose, he died.

A householder named Mittà, remembering that she had received food for three days, said to her, “Perish, vile woman. Today, at last, you have come to know the capacity of your belly.” This daughter of a respectable family, modest and timid, felt as though she had received a sword-thrust in her bosom, or as though salt water had been sprinkled on a sore. She immediately replied, “What do you mean, sir?” “The day before yesterday you took three portions, yesterday two, today you take but one. Today, then, you know the capacity of your belly.” “Sir, do not think that I took these for myself.” “Why then did you take them?” “Sir, the day before yesterday we were three, yesterday we were two, today I am left alone.” “How is that?” he inquired. She then told him the whole story from the beginning. As he listened to her story, he was unable to control his tears, but was overcome by the power of the grief that arose within him. Finally he said to her, “My dear girl, if this is the case, do not worry. Hitherto you have been the daughter of the treas- urer Bhaddavatiya, but from this day forth you shall be my very own daughter.” And he kissed her on the head, conducted her to his own house, and adopted her as his own oldest daughter. One day she heard loud and piercing screams in the refectory, whereupon she said to her foster-father, “Father, why do you not keep these people quiet when you dispense alms?” “It is impossible to do it, dear daughter.” “Father, it is quite pos- sible.” “How would you do it, dear daughter?” “Father, put a fence around the refectory and hang two gates through which"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"139 the people may pass in and out, allowing only sufficient space for one person to pass through at a time.

Now up to that time her name had been Sàmà, but through her con- struction of a fence she received, the name Sàmàvati. From that time on there was no more tumult in the refectory. Now the treasurer Ghosaka had long been accustomed to hear this noise in the refectory and rather liked to hear it; for it always made him think, “That is the noise in my refec- tory.” But after hearing no noise at all for two or three days, he asked the householder Mittà, who came one day to wait upon him, “Are alms being given to the blind, the poor, and other unfortunate persons?” “Yes sir.” “How then does it happen that for two or three days past I have not heard a sound?” I have arranged matters so that the people now received alms without making any noise.” “Why didn’t you do so before?” “I didn’t know how, sir.” “How did you happen to find a way just now?” “My daughter told me how to do it, sir.” “Have you a daughter whom I have never seen?” Then the householder told him the whole story of the treasurer Bhaddavatiya, begin- ning with the outbreak of the plague and ending with his adoption of the young girl as his own oldest daughter. Then said the treasurer to him, “If this is the case, why did you not tell me?

Accordingly on that day Sàmàvati also, accompa- nied by her five hundred women, went right through the palace court to bathe in the river. King Udena stood at his window and saw her. “Whose are those playful girls?” he inquired. “Nobody’s playful girls, your majesty.” “Then whose daughters are they?” “Your majesty, that is the daughter of the treasurer Bhaddavatiya, and her name is Sàmàvati.” Then the king conducted Sàmàvati and her retinue to the royal pal- ace and elevated her to the dignity of Queen Consort.

Màgandiya told the king that Sàmàvati and her maids had made holes in the walls of their living quarters and were being unfaithful to him. King Udena saw the holes in the walls, but when the matter was explained to him he did not get angry. Màgandiya kept on trying to make the king believe that Sàmàvati was trying to kill him.

Màgandiya, realising that none of her plots had materi- alised, made a final, infallible plan. She sent a message to her uncle with full instructions to go to Sàmàvati’s palace and burn down the building with all the women inside.

On arrival at the palace, all of them, including Màgan- diya, were seized and put to death in the palace courtyard.

Commentary Appamàda : this is an expression found in numerous contexts in the Teachings of the Buddha. Even in his last words this occurs. The exact significance of appamàda is “sanity” absence of madness which, according to Buddhism, is not a normal ( puthujjana ) state but a super- normal ( Ariya ) state. The Buddha meant by this term constant alert- ness and keen awareness of the process of experiencing. The trainees were advised to be constantly aware of the experience within to avoid involvement with existence ( bhava ). Therefore this alertness is a con- stant state of mind of the advanced trainee and an Awakened One. Amata : Nibbàna, the ultimate goal of Buddhists. As this positive term clearly indicates, Nibbàna is not annihilation or a state of nothingness as some are apt to believe. It is the permanent, immortal, supramun- dane state which cannot be expressed by mundane terms. Na mãyanti : do not die. This should not be understood to mean that they are immortal. No being is immortal, not even Buddhas or Arahants. The idea implied herein is that the heedful, who realize Nibbàna, are not reborn, and so do not die. The heedless are regarded as dead because they are not intent on doing good, and are subject to repeated births and deaths. Nibbàna : ni + vàna , lit., departure from craving. It is a supramundane state that can be attained in this life itself. It is also explained as extinction of passions, but not a state of nothingness. It is an eternal blissful state of relief that results from the complete eradication of the passions."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"24.

At one time, a plague epidemic broke out in the city of Ràjagaha. In the house of the city banker, the servants died on account of this disease; the banker and his wife were also attacked by the disease. When they were both infected with the disease they told their young son Kumbhaghosaka to leave them and flee from the house and to return only after a long time. Also, they told him that at such and such a place they had buried a treas- ure of great worth. The son left the city and stayed in a forest for twelve years and then came back to the city. By that time, he was quite a grown up youth and nobody in the city recognized him. He went to the place where the treasure was hidden and found it was intact. But he reasoned and realized that there was no one who could identify him and that if he were to unearth the buried treasure and make use of it people might think a young poor man had accidentally come upon buried treasure and they might report it to the king.

One morning, King Bimbisàra heard him. The king who was a keen judge of voices commented, “This is the voice of a man of great wealth.” A maid, hearing the king’s remark sent someone to investigate. He reported that the youth was only a hireling of the labourers. In spite of this report the king repeated the same remark on two subsequent days. Again, enquiries were made but with the same result. The maid thought that this was very strange, so she asked the king to give her permission to go and personally investigate. Dis- guised as ordinary folk, the maid and her daughter set out to the place of the laborers. Saying that they were travellers, they asked for shelter and were given accommodation in the house of Kumbhaghosaka just for one night. However, they man- aged to prolong their stay there. During that period, twice the king proclaimed that a certain ceremony must be performed in the locality of the laborers, and that every household must make contributions. Kumbhaghosaka had no ready cash for such an occasion. So he was forced to get some gold coins from his treasure. As these coins were handed over to the maid, she substituted them with her money and sent the coins to the king. After some time, she sent a message to the king asking him to send some men and summon Kumbhaghosaka to the court. Kum- bhaghosaka, reluctantly, went along with the men. The maid and her daughter also went to the palace, ahead of them. At the palace, the king told Kumbhaghosaka to speak out the truth and gave him assurance that he would not be harmed on this account.

The banker had two grandsons, named Mahàpanthaka and Cålapanthaka. Mahàpanthaka, being the elder, used to accompany his grandfather to listen to religious discourses. Later, Mahàpanthaka joined the Buddhist reli- gious order and soon after became an arahat. Cålapanthaka too followed his brother and became a monk, but could not even memorize one verse in four months. About that time, Jãvaka came to the monastery to invite the Buddha and the resident monks to his house for a meal. Mahàpanthaka, who was then in charge of assigning the monks to meal invitations, left out Cålapanthaka from the list. When Cålapanthaka learnt about this he felt very much frus- trated and decided that he would return to the life of a house- holder. Knowing his intention, the Buddha took him along and made him sit in front of the Gandhakuti hall. He then gave a clean white piece of cloth to Cålapanthaka and told him to sit there facing east and rub the piece of cloth with his hand. At the same time, he was to repeat the word “Rajoha- ranam”, which means “taking off impurity.” The Buddha then went to the residence of Jãvaka, accompanied by the monks. Meanwhile, Cålapanthaka went on rubbing the piece of cloth, all the time muttering the word “Rajoharanam”. Very soon, the cloth became soiled.

Only by remov- ing the dirt could one achieve one’s goal and attain arahatship”. Cålapanthaka got the message and attained arahatship. At the house of Jãvaka, they were about to offer water before serving food, as it was customary, but the Buddha cov- ered the bowl with his hand and asked if there were any monks left at the monastery. On being answered that there were none, the Buddha replied that there was one, and directed them to fetch Cålapanthaka from the monastery. When the messenger from the house of Jãvaka arrived at the monastery he found not only one monk, but a thousand identical monks. They had all been created by Cålapanthaka, who by now pos- sessed supernormal powers. The messenger was baffled and he turned back and reported the matter to Jãvaka. The mes- senger was sent to the monastery for the second time and was instructed to say that the Buddha summoned the monk by the name of Cålapanthaka. But when he delivered the mes- sage, a thousand voices responded, “I am Cålapanthaka.” Again baffled, he turned back for the second time. Then he was sent to the monastery, for the third time. This time, he was instructed to get hold of the monk who first said that he was Cålapanthaka. As soon as he got hold of that monk all the rest disappeared, and Cålapanthaka accompanied the messenger to the house of Jãvaka.

On a certain date there was a simpletons’ festival cele- brated in Sàvatthi, and on the occasion of this foolish holiday, folk used to smear their bodies with ashes and cow-dung and for a period of seven days go about uttering all manner of coarse talk. At this time people showed no respect for kinsfolk or friends or monks when they met them, but stood in the door- ways and insulted them with coarse talk. Those who could not endure the coarse talk would pay the holiday-makers a half or a quarter or a penny, according to their means, and the holiday- makers would take the money and depart from their houses. Now at this time there were in Sàvatthi five million Noble Disciples, and they sent word to the teacher, “Venerable, let the Buddha refrain for a period of seven days from enter- ing the city with the congregation of monks; let him instead remain at the monastery.” And, for a period of seven days the noble disciples caused food to be prepared for the congrega- tion of monks at the monastery and sent it to them, but did not themselves leave their houses.

We ourselves did not go out of the house.” The Buddha listened to what they said, and then replied, “In this manner unintelligent men conduct themselves.

Commentary bàlà : this is a categorization that occurs in most areas of Buddha’s teachings. The person referred to by this expression is generally thought of as an ignorant person, or as a foolish individual. But it does not mean that such a person is not adept in arts and crafts. What is meant is that the person so referred to is not sufficiently alert to reality – he is not capable of understanding the true nature of things. Such an individual’s behaviour is, at times, considered childish or immature, in terms of spiritual evolution. He is given to excessive self-indulgence and to the pursuit of sensual pleasures. He does not strive to become righteous, virtuous or to lead a life of good conduct. He does not know what is beneficial to him for this world and for the next. In modem psychological jargon, it means “an emotionally imma- ture person”. pamàdaü anuyu¤janti : The term “ pamàda ” literally means the “basic insanity” that all unenlightened people suffer from. It is being car- ried away by emotions and losing awareness of reality. It is lack of emotional control. It is the same thing as emotional immaturity. It may be also called “neurosis”. We translate it here as mindlessness or unmindfulness as opposed to mindfulness. seññhaü dhanaü iva : The expression concerns the mindful. They protect their mindfulness as one would protect a great treasure. Those people who are sensuous, think in terms of wealth as a means of enjoying worldly pleasures. Therefore, to them worldly wealth is the only treasure that matters. In the old commentaries, worldly treasures are considered to be seven in number. They are gold, silver, pearls, gems, lapis lazuli, conch and the shila gem. But to the truth-seekers the treasures are mindfulness and steadfastness. These ensure the means of obtaining the highest Fruits of Spiritual Realization."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"158 Explanatory Translation (Verse 27) pamàdaü mà anuyu¤jetha kàmaratisanthavaü mà ( anuyu¤jetha ) appamatto hi jhàyanto vipulaü sukhaü pappoti pamàdaü : heedlessness; mà : do not; anuyu¤jetha : indulge in; kàmaratisanthavaü : sensual pleasures; mà : avoid; appamatto hi : the mindful person; jhàyanto : meditatively engaged; vipulaü sukhaü : high-bliss; pappoti : reaches.

The stanza stresses the fact that such indulgence leads to the relaxa- tion of mindfulness and the flagging of enthusiasm for truth-seeking.

It is this “thirst”, desire, greed, craving, manifesting itself in various ways, that gives rise to all forms of suffering and the continuity of being ( bhava ). But it should not be taken as the first cause, for there is no first cause possible, according to Buddhism, because everything must have a cause. So “thirst” is not the first or the only condition for the arising of sorrow. But it is an essential condition for the arising of sorrow. The term “thirst” includes not only desire for, and attachment to, sense-pleasures, wealth and power, but also desire for, and attachment to, ideas and ideals, views, opinions, theories, conceptions and beliefs.

Great statesmen who try to settle international disputes and talk of war and peace only in economic and political terms touch the superficialities, and never go deep into the real root of the problem. As the Buddha told Raññapàla: “The world lacks and hankers, and is enslaved to ‘thirst’.” Kàmarati can also be described as the sensual urge. In modern lan- guage, it may be called “the impulsive urge.” The Buddha said, “What, O monk, is the origin of suffering? It is that craving which gives rise to ever fresh rebirth and, bound up with pleasure and lust, now here, now there, finds ever fresh delight.” The sensual urge is accompanied by the urge for existence or the urge for non-existence. Of this urge or Craving for Existence it is said: “No first beginning of the Craving for Existence can be perceived, O monks, before which it was not and after which it came to be. But it can be perceived that Craving for Existence has its specific condi- tion. I say, O monks, that also Craving for Existence has its conditions that feed it and are not without it. And what is it? ‘Ignorance’, one has to reply – Craving for Existences and Ignorance are called “the outstanding causes that lead to happy and unhappy destinies (courses of existence).” Kàmac- chanda means sensual desires or attachment to pleasurable sense-objects such as form, sound, odour, taste, and contact. This, too, is regarded as one of the fetters that bind one to Saüsàra. An average person is bound to get tempted by t hese alluri ng objects of sense. Lack of self- cont rol results i n t he inevitable arising of passions. This Hindrance is inhibited by One-point- edness, which is one of the five characteristics of Jhànas. it is attenuated on attaining Sakadàgàmi and is completely eradicated on attaining Anàgàmi. Subtle forms of attachment such as Råpa Ràga and Aråpa Ràga (Attach- ment to Realms of Form and Formless Realms) are eradicated only on attaining Arahatship. The following six conditions tend to the eradication of sense-desires. (i) perceiving the loathsomeness of the object, (ii) constant meditation on loathsomeness, (iii) sense-restraint, (iv) moderation in food, (v) good friendship, and (vi) profitable talk."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"161 Another comment is as follows: Dependent on feeling arises craving which, like ignorance, is the other most important factor in the “Dependent origination.” Attachment, thirst and clinging are some renderings for this Pàli term. This is an aspect of the 2nd Noble Truth – Craving is threefold – namely, craving for sensual pleas- ures, craving for sensual pleasures associated with the view of eternalism, i.e., enjoying pleasures thinking that they are imperishable, and craving for sensual pleasures with the view of nihilism i.e., enjoying pleasures thinking that everything perishes after death. The last is the materialistic standpoint. These are also interpreted as attachment to Realms of Form and Formless Realms respectively. Usually these two terms are rendered by craving for existence and non-existence. There are six kinds of crav- ing corresponding to the six sense objects such as form, sound and so on. They become twelve when they are treated as internal and external. They are reckoned as thirty-six when viewed as past, present and future. When multiplied by the foregoing three kinds of craving, they amount to one hundred and eight. It is natural for a worldling to develop a craving for the pleasures of sense. To overcome sense-desires is extremely difficult. The most powerful factors in the wheel of life are ignorance and craving, the two main causes of the Dependent Origination. Ignorance is shown as the past cause that conditions the present; and craving, the present cause that conditions the future. Dependent on craving is grasping which is intense craving. Craving is like groping in the dark to steal an object. Grasping corresponds to the actual stealing of the object. Grasping is caused by both attachment and error. It gives rise to the false notions, of “I” and “mine”. Grasping is four-fold – namely, Sensuality, False Views, Adherence to rites and ceremonies, and the Theory of a soul. mà pamàdaü anuyu¤jetha : this is an admonition to those who quest for truth.

Living beings pass from one existence to another and obtain a new conception in a mother’s womb without the knowledge of mother or father, and this knowledge cannot be fully understood.

Sorrow, or suffering, has been described by the Buddha as a universal truth. Birth is suffering, decay is suffering, disease is suffering, death is suffering, to be united with the unpleasant is suffering, to be separated from the pleasant is suffering, not to get what one desires is suffering. In brief, the five aggre- gates of attachment are suffering. The Buddha does not deny happiness in"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"165 life when he says there is suffering. On the contrary he admits different forms of happiness, both material and spiritual, for laymen as well as for monks. In the Buddha’s Teachings, there is a list of happinesses, such as the happiness of family life and the happiness of the life of a recluse, the hap- piness of sense pleasures and the happiness of renunciation, the happiness of attachment and the happiness of detachment, physical happiness and mental happiness etc. But all these are included in suffering. Even the very pure spiritual states of trance attained by the practice of higher meditation are included in suffering. The conception of suffering may be viewed from three aspects: (i) suffering as ordinary suffering, (ii) suffering as produced by change and (iii) suffering as conditioned states. All kinds of suffering in life like birth, old age, sickness, death, association with unpleasant persons and condi- tions, separation from beloved ones and pleasant conditions, not getting what one desires, grief, lamentation, distress – all such forms of physical and mental suffering, which are universally accepted as suffering or pain, are included in suffering as ordinary suffering. A happy feeling, a happy condition in life, is not permanent, not everlasting. It changes sooner or later. When it changes, it produces pain, suffering, unhappiness. This vicis- situde is included in suffering as suffering produced by change. It is easy to understand the two forms of suffering mentioned above. No one will dis- pute them. This aspect of the First Noble Truth is more popularly known because it is easy to understand. It is common experience in our daily life. But the third form of suffering as conditioned states is the most important philosophical aspect of the First Noble Truth, and it requires some analyti- cal explanation of what we consider as a ‘being’, as an ‘individual’ or as ‘I’. What we call a ‘being’, or an ‘individual’, or ‘I’, according to Buddhist phil- osophy, is only a combination of ever-changing physical and mental forces or energies, which may be divided into five groups or aggregates. dhãro bàle avekkhati : The sorrowless Arahants look compassionately with their Divine Eye upon the ignorant folk, who, being subject to repeated births, are not free from sorrow.

The other, a heedful monk, engaged in meditation, thus admonished his friend, “Brother, do not act thus. For a monk that is heedless stand ready four states of suffering, as if they were his own house.

When the two monks had completed residence, they went to the Buddha, paid obeisance to him, and sat down respectfully on one side. The Buddha exchanged friendly greetings with them and queried, “I trust that you have lived the life of heedfulness and that you have devoted yourselves earnestly to the practice of meditation. I trust that you have reached the goal of the Religious Life.” The heedless monk replied, “Venerable, how can this monk be said to be heedful? From the time he left you he has done nothing but lie and sleep.” “But you, monk?” “I Venerable, early in the morning brought firewood and prepared the charcoal-dish, and dur- ing the first watch I sat and warmed myself, but I did not spend my time sleeping.” Then said the Buddha to the sloth- ful monk, “You who have spent your time in heedlessness say, ‘I am heedful.’ You mistake heedlessness for heedfulness.

A youth of high station, born and reared in a certain market-town not far from Sàvatthi, retired from the world and became a monk in the religion of the Buddha. On making his full profession, he became known as Tissa of the Market- town, or Nigàma Tissa. He acquired the reputation of being frugal, content, pure, resolute. He always made his rounds for alms in the village where his relatives resided. Although, in the neighbouring city of Sàvatthi, Anàthapiõóika and other disciples were bestowing abundant offerings and Pasenadi Kosala was bestowing gifts beyond compare, he never went to Sàvatthi. One day the monks began to talk about him and said to the teacher, “This monk Nigàma Tissa, busy and active, lives in intimate association with his kinsfolk. Although Anàtha- piõóika and other disciples are bestowing abundant offerings and Pasenadi Kosala is bestowing gifts beyond compare, he never comes to Sàvatthi.” The Buddha had Nigàma Tissa summoned and asked him, “Monk, is the report true that you are doing thus and so?” “Venerable,” replied Tissa, “It is not true that I live in intimate association with my relatives.

For frugality is my disposition and my habit.” And in response to a request of the monks he related the following. Once upon a time several thousand parrots lived in a certain grove of fig-trees in the Himàlayan country on the bank of the Ganges. One of them, the king-parrot, when the fruits of the tree in which he lived had withered away, ate whatever he found remaining, whether shoot or leaf or bark, drank water from the Ganges, and being very happy and con- tented, remained where he was. In fact he was so very happy and contented that the abode of Sakka began to quake. Sakka, observing how happy and contented the parrot was, visited him and turned the whole forest into a green and flourishing place. The Buddha pointed out that even in the past birth he was contented and happy and that such a monk will never slip back from the vicinity of Nibbàna.

Were there not the unborn, ungrown, and unconditioned, there would be no escape for the born, grown, and conditioned, so there is escape for the born, grown, and conditioned.” “Here the four elements of solidity, fluidity, heat and motion have no place; the notions of length and breadth, the subtle and the gross, good and evil, name and form are altogether destroyed; neither this world nor the other, nor coming, going or standing, neither death nor birth, nor sense-objects are to be found.” Because Nibbàna is thus expressed in negative terms, there are many who have got a wrong notion that it is negative, and expresses self- annihilation. Nibbàna is definitely no annihilation of self, because there is no self to annihilate. If at all, it is the annihilation of the very process of being, of the conditional continuous in saüsàra , with the illusion or delusion of permanency and identity, with a staggering ego of I and mine. abhabbo parihànàya : not liable to suffer fall.

It is this citta that is either defiled or purified, and is the bitterest enemy and the greatest friend of oneself. This citta seems to be the equivalent of ‘soul’ in Western thought. In Buddhism, however, the ‘soul’ as a permanent entity is not recognized. Citta which takes its place refers to the emo- tional state of a person which is not an entity but a fluctuating activity like a flame. Sometimes emotions are excited and sometimes the citta is calm (emotions are absent). We might even translate it as the ‘tempera- ment’ or ‘temper’. Writers on Buddhism mistakenly call it ‘mind’ or ‘con- sciousness’. But what is meant is the ‘affective’ rather than the cognitive aspects of the mental process. When a person is fast asleep and is in a dreamless state, he experiences a kind of mental state which is more or less passive than active. It is similar to the mental state one experiences at the moment of conception and at the moment of death. The Buddhist philosophical term for this type of mental state is Bhavanga citta which means the mental state natural to one’s condition of existence. Arising and perishing every moment, it flows on like a stream not remaining the same for two consecutive moments. We do experience this type of mental state not only in a dreamless state but also in our waking state. In the course of our life we experience Bhavanga mental states more than any other type of mental state. Hence Bhavanga becomes the natural state of mind. Some scholars identify Bhavanga with sub-consciousness. Accord- ing to the Dictionary of Philosophy sub-consciousness is ‘a compartment of the mind alleged by certain psychologists and philosophers to exist below the threshold of consciousness.’ In the opinion of some Western psychologists, sub-consciousness and consciousness co-exist. But Bhavanga is not a sub-plane. It does not correspond to F. W. Myer’s subliminal consciousness either. Bhavanga is so called because it is the resting state of mind that is natural to an individual’s life-continuum. That is why life-continuum has been suggested as the English equivalent for Bhavanga . But a better translation could be ‘Resting mental state’."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"188 This Bhavanga state of mind which one always experiences as long as it is uninterrupted by external stimuli, vibrates for a thought- moment and passes away when a stimulus activates the senses. Sup- pose, for instance, the eye is stimulated. Then the Bhavanga stream of consciousness is arrested and sense-door consciousness (whose func- tion is to turn the attention towards the object) arises and passes away. Immediately after this, there arises a visual perception which sees the object, but yet knows no more about it. This sense operation is followed by a moment of the reception of the object so seen. Next arises the investigating thought-moment which momentarily examines the object so seen. This is followed by the determining thought-moment. On this depends the subsequent psychologically important stage Javana. It is at this stage that an action is judged, whether it be moral or immoral when discrimination is exercised and will play its part. Kamma is performed at this stage. If decided correctly, it becomes moral; if wrongly, immoral. Irre- spective of the desirability or the undesirability of the object presented to the mind, it is possible for one to make the Javana process moral or immoral. If, for instance, one meets an enemy, anger will arise automati- cally. A wise person might, on the contrary, with self-control, radiate a thought of love towards him. This is the reason why the Buddha stated: By self is evil done, By self is one defiled, By self is no evil done, By self is one purified. Both defilement and purity depend on oneself. No one is purified by another. It is an admitted fact that environment, circumstances, habitual tendencies and the like condition our thoughts. On such occasions will is subordinated.

An extraneous element may be a causative factor, but we ourselves are directly responsible for the actions that finally follow. It is extremely difficult to suggest a suitable rendering for Javana . A perception is suggested by some. Impulse is suggested as an alternative rendering, which seems to be less satisfactory than a percep- tion. Here, the Pàli term is retained. Javana , literally, means running. It is so called because, in the course of a thought-process, it runs consequently for seven thought- moments, or, at times of death, for five thought-moments with an identi- cal object. The mental states occurring in all these thought-moments are similar, but the potential force differs. This entire thought-process which takes place in an infinitesimal part of time ends with the registering consciousness lasting for two thought-moments. Thus one thought-process is completed at the expi- ration of seventeen thought-moments. This is the analysis of a thought process involved in the experience of an object, In the Buddhist system an essential element in the quest for higher spiritual achievement is the reflection upon the real nature of the mind – cittànupassanà . ‘ Cittànupassanà ’ means reflection of mind. The mind is so complex and subtle that even modern science has not been able to grasp its real nature. But the Buddha was able to comprehend the real nature of the mind by developing his own mind. Development of mind leads to concentration. The mind thus developed could be easily diverted to transcendental knowledge. However, such a state cannot be attained easily. The mind does not rest in one object, it always strays away. When one attempts to control the mind, it wriggles like a fish taken out of water. Therefore the controlling of the mind should be done with great effort. According to the Abhidhamma there are 121 types of the mind. In this meditation ( Cittànupassanà ) 16 aspects of the mind are described. They are: 1. Saràga , 2. Vitaràga , 3. Sadosa , 4. Vãtadosa , 5. Samoha , 6. Vãta- moha , 7. Saükhiñña , 8. Vikkhiñña , 9.

Once there lived in Sàvatthi a senior monk by the name of Saïgharakkhita. When his sister gave birth to a son, she named the child after the monk and he came to be known as Saïgharakkhita Bhàgineyya. The nephew Saïgharakkhita, in due course, was admitted into the Sangha. While the young monk was staying in a village monastery he was offered two sets of robes, and he intended to offer one to his uncle, monk Saïgharakkhita. At the end of the rainy season he went to his uncle to pay respect to him and offered the robe to the monk. But, the uncle declined to accept the robe, saying that he had enough. Although he repeated his request, the monk would not accept it. The young monk felt disheartened and thought that since his uncle was so unwilling to share the requisites with him, it would be better for him to leave the Saïgha and live the life of a layman. From that point, his mind wandered and a train of thoughts followed. He thought that after leaving the Sangha he would sell the robe and buy a she-goat; that the she-goat would breed quickly and soon he would make enough money to enable him to marry; his wife would give birth to a son. He would take his wife and child in a small cart to visit his"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"200 uncle at the monastery. On the way, he would say that he would carry the child; she would tell him to drive the cart and not to bother about the child. He would insist and grab the child from her; between them the child would fall on the cart-track and the wheel would pass over the child. He would get so furious with his wife that he would strike her with the goading- stick. At that time he was fanning the monk with a palmyrah fan and he absent-mindedly struck the head of the monk with the fan. The monk, knowing the thoughts of the young monk, said, “You were unable to beat your wife; why have you beaten an old monk?” Young Saïgharakkhita was very much sur- prised and embarrassed at the words of the old monk; he also became extremely frightened. So he fled. Young monks and novices of the monastery chased after him, caught him, and finally brought him to the presence of the Buddha. When told about the experience, the Buddha said that the mind has the ability to think of an object even though it might be far away, and that one should strive hard for libera- tion from the bondage of passion, ill will and ignorance. After the Buddha recited the stanza near the end of the discourse, the young monk attained sotàpatti fruition.

A certain youth of a respectable family, a herdsman, liv- ing at Sàvatthi, went into the forest to look for an ox that was lost. During midday, he saw the ox and released the herds, and being oppressed by hunger and thirst, he thought to him- self, “I can surely get something to eat from the noble monks.” So he entered the monastery, went to the monks, bowed to them, and stood respectfully on one side. Now at that time the food which remained over and above to the monks who had eaten lay in the vessel used for refuse. When the monks saw that youth, exhausted by hunger as he was, they said to him, “Here is food; take and eat it.” (When a Buddha is living in the world, there is always a plentiful supply of rice- porridge, together with various sauces). So the youth took and ate as much food as he needed drank water, washed his hands, and then bowed to the monks and asked them, “Venerable, did you go to some house by invitation today?” “No, lay disciple; monks always receive food in this way.” The youth thought to himself, “No matter how busy and active we may be, though we work continually both by night and by day, we never get rice-porridge so deliciously seasoned. But these monks, according to their own statement, eat it continually. Why should I remain a layman any longer? I will become a monk.” Accordingly he approached the monks and asked to be received into the Sangha. The monks said to"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"204 him, “Very well, lay disciple,” and received him into the Sangha. After making his full profession, he performed all the various major and minor duties; and in but a few days, sharing in the rich offerings which accrue in the Buddha’s Dispensation, he became fat and comfortable. Then he thought to himself, “Why should I live on food obtained by making the alms-round? I will become a layman once more.” So back he went and entered his house. After working in his house for only a few days, his body became thin and weak. Thereupon he said to himself, “Why should I endure this suffering any longer? I will become a monk.” So back he went and re-ordained. But after spending a few days as a monk, becoming discontented again, went back to lay-life. “Why should I live the life of a layman any longer? I will become a monk.” So saying, he went to the monks, bowed, and asked to be received into the Sangha. Because he had been with them, the monks received him into the Sangha once more. In this manner he entered the Sangha and left it again six times in succession. The monks said to themselves, “This man lives under the sway of his thoughts.” So they gave him the name Thought-Controlled, elder Cittahattha. As he was thus going back and forth, his wife became pregnant. The seventh time he returned from the forest with his farming implements he went to the house, put his imple- ments away, and entered his own room, saying to himself, “I will put on my yellow robe again.” Now his wife happened to be in bed and asleep at the time. Her undergarment had fallen off, saliva was flowing from her mouth, she was snoring, her mouth was wide open; she appeared to him like a swollen corpse. Grasping the thought, “All that is in this world is tran- sitory, is involved in suffering,” he said to himself, “To think"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"205 that because of her, all the time I have been a monk, I have been unable to continue steadfast in the monastic life!” Straightaway, taking his yellow robe, he ran out of the house, binding the robe about his belly as he ran. Now his mother-in-law lived in the same house with him. When she saw him departing in this way, she said to herself, “This renegade, who but this moment returned from the forest, is running from the house, binding his yellow robe about him as he runs, and is making for the monastery. What is the mean- ing of this?” Entering the house and seeing her daughter asleep, she knew at once, “It was because he saw her sleeping that he became disgusted, and went away.” So she shook her daughter and said to her, “Rise, your husband saw you asleep, became disgusted, and went away. He will not be your husband hence- forth.” “Begone, mother. What does it matter whether he has gone or not? He will be back again in but a few days.” As Cittahattha proceeded on his way, repeating the words, “All that is in this world is transitory, is involved in suffering,” he obtained the fruit of conversion ( sotàpatti phala ). Continuing his journey, he went to the monks, bowed to them, and asked to be received into the Sangha. “No,” said the monks, “we cannot receive you into the Sangha. Why should you become a monk? Your head is like a grindstone.” “Venerable, receive me into the Sangha just this once.” Because he had helped them, they received him into the Sangha. After a few days he attained ara- hatship, together with the supernatural faculties. Thereupon they said to him, “Brother Cittahattha, doubtless you alone will decide when it is time for you to go away again; you have remained here a long while this time.” “Venerables, when I was attached to the world, I went away; but now I have put away attachment to the world; I have no"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"206 longer any desire to go away.” The monks went to the Buddha and said, “Venerable, we said such and such to this monk, and he said such and such to us in reply.

The Arahats, however, having transcended all life – affirming and rebirth – producing actions, are said to be ‘beyond merit and demerit.’ The deeds of an Arahant : a perfect Saint, are neither good nor bad because he has gone beyond both good and evil. This does not mean that he is pas- sive. He is active but his activity is selfless and is directed to help others to tread the path he has trod himself. His deeds, ordinarily accepted as good, lack creative power as regards himself in producing Kammic effects. He is not however exempt from the effects of his past actions. He accumulates no fresh kammic activities. Whatever actions he does, as an Arahant, are termed “inoperative” ( kiriya ), and are not regarded as Kamma. They are ethically ineffective.

Five hundred monks from Sàvatthi, after obtaining a meditation topic from the Buddha, travelled for a distance of one hundred leagues away from Sàvatthi and came to a large forest grove, a suitable place for meditation practice. The guardian spirits of the trees dwelling in that forest thought that if those monks were staying in the forest, it would not be proper for them to live with their families. They descended from the trees, thinking that the monks would stop there only for one night. But the monks were still there at the end of a fortnight; then it occurred to them that the monks might be staying there till the end of the vassa. In that case, they and their families would have to be living on the ground for a long time. So, they decided to frighten away the monks, by making ghostly sounds and frightful apparitions. They showed up with bodies without heads, and with heads without bodies. The monks were very upset and left the place and returned to the Buddha, to whom they related everything. On hearing their account, the Buddha told them that this had happened because previously they went without any protection and that they should go back there armed with suitable protection. So saying, the Buddha taught them the protective discourse Metta Sutta at length (Loving-Kindness) beginning with the following stanza:"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"211 Karanãyamattha kusalena – yaü taü santaü padaü abhisamecca sakko ujå ca såjå ca – suvaco c ’ assa mudu anatimàni . “He who is skilled in (acquiring) what is good and beneficial, (mundane as well as supramundane), aspiring to attain perfect peace (Nibbàna) should act (thus): He should be efficient, upright, perfectly upright, compliant, gentle and free from conceit.” The monks were instructed to recite the sutta from the time they came to the outskirts of the forest grove and to enter the monastery reciting it. The monks returned to the forest grove and did as they were told. The guardian spirits of the trees receiving loving- kindness from the monks reciprocated by welcoming them and not harming them. There were no more ghostly sounds and frightening sights. Thus left in peace, the monks medi- tated on the body and came to realize its fragile and imper- manent nature. From the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha, by his supernormal power, learned about the progress of the monks and sent forth his radiance making them feel his presence.

Small boils appeared all over his body and these developed into big sores. When these sores burst, his upper and lower robes became sticky and stained with body fluids, and his body was stinking. For this reason, he was known as Påtigattatissa, Tissa the thera with a stinking body. Now the Buddha never failed to survey the world twice a day. At dawn he surveyed the world, looking from the rim of the world towards the perfumed chamber. Now at this time the Venerable Påtigatta Tissa appeared within the net of the Buddha’s sight.

Then he went, and taking his stand near Tissa, moistened his body with warm water and bathed him. At the end of his bath his upper garment was dry. The Buddha caused him to be clothed in his upper garment and washed thoroughly his under garment in hot water and laid in the sun to dry. As soon as the water had evaporated from his body, his under garment was dry. Thereupon Tissa put on his under garment and, with body refreshed and mind tran- quil, lay down on the bed.

At that moment, monk Mahàkaccàyana was adjusting his robes outside the city, as he was going into the city of Soreyya for alms-food. The youth Soreyya, seeing the youth- ful complexion of the monk, thought, “How I wish the monk were my wife, so that the complexion of my wife would be like his.” As the wish arose in him, his sex changed and he became a woman. Very much ashamed, he got down from the carriage and ran away, taking the road to Taxila. His compan- ions looked for him, but they could not find him. Soreyya, now a woman, offered her signet ring to some people going to Taxila, to allow her to go with them in their carriage. Upon arrival at Taxila, her companions told a young rich man of Taxila about the lady who came along with them. The young rich man, finding her to be very beautiful and of a suitable age for him, married her. As a result of this marriage two sons were born; there were also two sons from the previ- ous marriage of Soreyya as a man. One day, a rich man’s son from the city of Soreyya came to Taxila with a caravan of five hundred carts. Lady Soreyya, recognizing him to be an old friend, sent for him.

The man from the city of Soreyya then advised the Lady Soreyya to ask par- don from the monk. Monk Mahàkaccàyana was accordingly invited to the home of Soreyya and alms-food was offered to him. After the meal, the Lady Soreyya was brought to the presence of the monk, and the man from Soreyya told the monk that the lady was at one time the son of a rich man from Soreyya. He then explained to the monk how Soreyya was turned into a female on account of his wrongful thoughts towards the respected monk. Lady Soreyya then respectfully asked pardon of Monk Mahàkaccàyana. The monk then said, “Get up, I forgive you.” As soon as these words were spoken, the woman was changed back to a man. Soreyya then pondered how within a single existence and with a single body he had undergone change of sex and how sons were born to him. And feeling very weary and repulsive of all these things, he decided to leave the householder’s life and joined the sangha under the monk. After that, he was often asked, “Whom do you love more, the two sons you had as a man or the other two you had as a woman?” To those, he would answer that his love for those borne as a woman was greater.

The sensual world com- prises the hells, the animal kingdom, the ghost realm, the demon world, the human world and the six lower celestial worlds. In the form world there still exists the faculties of seeing and hearing, which, together with the other sense faculties, are temporarily suspended in the four Absorptions. In the formless world there is no corporeality whatsoever; only four aggregates ( khanda ) exist there. Though the term loka is not applied in the Suttas to those three worlds, but only the term bhava , ‘existence’, there is no doubt that the teaching about the three worlds belongs to the earliest, i.e., Sutta- period of the Buddhist scriptures as many relevant passages show. Yamaloka : the World of Yama. Yama is death – Yama is almost syn- onym ous with Màra. Màra : the Buddhist ‘Tempter’-figure.

He"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"230 appears in the texts both as a real person (as a deity) and as personifica- tion of evil and passions, of the worldly existence and of death. Later Pàli literature often speaks of a ‘five-fold Màra’: (i) Màra as a deity; (ii) the Màra of defilements; (iii) the Màra of the Aggregates; (iv) the Màra of Karma-formations; and (v) Màra as Death. Màra is equated with Death in most instances. ‘Death’, in ordinary usage, means ‘the disappear- ance of the vital faculty confined to a single life-time, and therewith of the psycho-physical life-process conventionally called ‘Man, Animal, Personality, Ego’ etc. Strictly speaking, however, death is the momentary arising dissolution and vanishing of each physical-mental combination. About this momentary nature of existence, it is said: In the absolute sense, beings have only a very short moment to live, life lasting as long as a single moment that consciousness lasts. Just as a cart-wheel, whether rolling or whether at a standstill, at all times is only resting on a single point of its periphery: even so the life of a living being lasts only for the duration of a single moment of con- sciousness. As soon as that moment ceases, the being also ceases. For it is said: ‘The being of the past moment of consciousness has lived, but does not live now, nor will it live in future. The being of the future moment has not yet lived, nor does it live now, but it will live in the future. The being of the present moment has not lived, it does live just now, but it will not live in the future.” In another sense, the coming to an end of the psycho-physical life process of the Arahat, or perfectly Holy One, at the moment of his passing away, may be called the final and ultimate death, as up to that moment the psycho-physical life-process was still going on. Death, in the ordinary sense, combined with old age, forms the twelfth link in the formula of Dependent Origination. Death, according to Buddhism, is the cessation of the psycho- physical life of any individual existence. It is the passing away of vital- ity, i.e., psychic and physical life, heat and consciousness. Death is not the complete annihilation of a being, for though a particular lifespan ends, the force which hitherto actuated it is not destroyed."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"231 Just as an electric light is the outward visible manifestation of invisible electric energy, so we are the outward manifestations of invisible karmic energy. The bulb may break, and the light may be extinguished, but the current remains and the light may be repro- duced in another bulb. In the same way, the karmic force remains undisturbed by the disintegration of the physical body, and the pass- ing away of the present consciousness leads to the arising of a fresh one in another birth. But nothing unchangeable or permanent ‘passes’ from the present to the future. In the foregoing case, the thought experienced before death being a moral one, the resultant re-birth-consciousness takes as its material an appropriate sperm and ovum cell of human parents. The rebirth-consciousness then lapses into the Bhavaïga state. The conti- nuity of the flux, at death, is unbroken in point of time, and there is no breach in the stream of consciousness. sadevakaü : the world of the celestial beings. They are referred to as the Radiant Ones. Heavenly Beings, deities; beings who live in happy worlds, and who, as a rule, are invisible to the human eye. They are subject however, just as all human and other beings, to repeated rebirth, old age and death, and thus not freed from the cycle of existence, and not freed from misery. There are many classes of heavenly beings. kusalo : in this context this expression refers to expertise. But, in Buddhist literature, Kusala is imbued with many significance. Kusala means ‘karmically wholesome’ or ‘profitable’, salutary, and morally good, (skilful). Connotations of the term, according to commentaries are: of good health, blameless, productive of favourable karma-result, skilful. It should be noted that commentary excludes the meaning ‘skilful’, when the term is applied to states of consciousness. In psycho- logical terms: ‘karmically wholesome’ are all those karmical volitions and the consciousness and mental factors associated therewith, which are accompanied by two or three wholesome Roots, i.e., by greedless- ness and hatelessness, and in some cases also by non-delusion. Such states of consciousness are regarded as ‘karmically wholesome’ as"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"232 they are causes of favourable karma results and contain the seeds of a happy destiny or rebirth. From this explanation, two facts should be noted: (i) it is volition that makes a state of consciousness, or an act, ‘good’ or ‘bad’; (ii) the moral criterion in Buddhism is the presence or absence of the three Wholesome or Moral Roots. The above explana- tions refer to mundane wholesome consciousness. Supermundane wholesome states, i.e., the four Paths of Sanctity, have as results only the corresponding four Fruitions; they do not constitute Karma, nor do they lead to rebirth, and this applies also to the good actions of an Arahat and his meditative states which are all karmically inoperative. Dhammapada : the commentary states that this term is applied to the thirty-seven Factors of Enlightenment. They are: (i) the Four Founda- tions of Mindfulness – namely, 1. contemplation of the body, 2. con- templation of the feelings, 3. contemplation of states of mind, and 4. contemplation of dhammas; (ii) the Four Supreme Efforts – namely, 1. the effort to prevent evil that has not arisen, 2. the effort to discard evil that has already arisen, 3. the effort to cultivate unarisen good, and 4. the effort to promote good that has already arisen; (iii) the Four Means of Accomplishment – namely, will, energy, thought, and wisdom; (iv) the Five Faculties – namely, confidence, energy, mindful- ness, concentration, and wisdom; (v) the Five Forces , having the same names as the Indriyas; (vi) the Seven Constituents of Enlightenment – namely, mindfulness, investigation of Reality, energy, joy, serenity, concentration, and equanimity; (vi) Eight-fold Path – namely, right views, right thoughts, right speech, right actions, right livelihood, right endeavour, right mindfulness and right concentration. yama loka : the realms of Yama. By the realms of Yama are meant the four woeful states – namely, hell, the animal kingdom, the peta realm, and the asura realm. Hell is not permanent according to Buddhism.

A monk obtained a meditation topic from the Buddha and entered the forest for the purpose of practising medita- tion. But when, after striving and struggling with might and main, he was unable to attain arahatship, he said to himself, “I will ask the Buddha to give me a meditation topic that better suits my needs.” With this thought in mind he set out to return to the Buddha. On the way he saw a mirage. He said to himself, “Even as this mirage, as seen in the season of the heat, appears sub- stantial to those that are far off, but vanishes on nearer approach, so also is this existence unsubstantial by reason of birth and decay.” Upon fixing his mind on the mirage, he meditated on the mirage. On his return, wearied with the journey, he bathed in the Aciravati River and seated himself in the shade of a tree on the river bank near a waterfall. As he sat there watching the white water bursting from the force of the water striking against the rocks, he said to himself, “Just as this existence produced and just so does it burst.” And this he took for his meditation topic.

To achieve that one must destroy Màra’s flower-arrows by which he tempts men and women. It is necessary that the truth-seeker should go beyond Màra’s region, to areas unseen by him. Màra knows only the realm of death. The truth seeker goes beyond that region to the ‘deathless’ (Nibbàna) – a domain Màra has never seen. Commentary pheõåpamaü : like froth.

In the latter case it is either a collective name for the four mental groups (feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness) or merely for feeling, perception and a few of the mental formations. Kàya has this same meaning in the stereotype description of the third absorption “and he feels joy in his mind or his mental constitution, and of the attainment of the eight deliverance; “having attained the eight deliverance in his mind, or his person”. Kàya is also the fifth sense-organ, the body- organ. marãci Dhammaü : the nature of a Mirage. Dhamma has many con- notations.

The Comment to Dham- mapada gives four applications of this term: quality, virtue, instruc- tion, text, soullessness, e.g. “all dhamma, phenomena, are impersonal etc.”. The traditional Comment has hetu (condition) instead of desanà . Thus, the analytical knowledge of the Law is explained as knowledge of the condition.

Not wishing to offend King Pasenadi, the Sàkyan princes replied that they would comply with his request, but instead of a Sàkyan princess they sent a very beautiful girl, born of King Mahànàma, by a slave woman.

Sense-desire is also one of the cankers and clingings. “There are five cords of sensuality; the visible objects, cogni- zable by eye-consciousness, that are desirable, cherished, pleasant, lovely, sensuous and alluring; the sounds... smells... tastes... bodily impressions cognizable by body-consciousness, that are desirable...” These two kinds of kàma are also called: kàma as a mental defilement, as the object-base of sensuality. Sense-desire is finally eliminated at the stage of the non-returner. The peril and misery of sense-desire are often described in the texts which often stress the fact that what fetters man to the world of the senses are not the sense- organs nor the sense-objects but desire."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"49.

In the village of Sakkara, near Ràjagaha, there lived a miserly rich man by the name of Kosiya, who was very reluc- tant to give away even the tiniest part of anything belonging to him. One day, to avoid sharing with others, the rich man and his wife were making pancakes in the uppermost story of their house, where no one would see them. Early in the morning, on that day, the Buddha through his supernormal power, saw the rich man and his wife in his vision, and knew that both of them would soon attain sotàpatti fruition. So he sent Mahà Moggallàna to the house of the rich man, with instructions to bring the couple to the Jetavana Monastery in time for the midday meal. By supernormal power, he reached Kosiya’s house in an instant and stood at the window. The rich man saw him and asked him to leave. He just stood there without saying anything. In the end, Kosiya said to his wife, “Make a very small pancake and give it to the monk.” So she took just a little amount of dough and put it in the pan, and the cake filled up the whole pan. Kosiya thought his wife must have put in too much, so he took just a pinch of dough and put it into the pan; his pancake also swelled into a big one. It so happened that however little dough they"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"247 put in, they were unable to make small pancakes. At last, Kosiya asked his wife to offer one from the basket to the monk. When she tried to take out one from the basket it would not come off because all the pancakes were sticking together and could not be separated. By this time Kosiya had lost all appetite for pancakes and offered the whole basket of pan- cakes to Mahà Moggallàna. The chief disciple then delivered a discourse on charity to the rich man and his wife. He also told the couple about how the Buddha was waiting with five hundred monks at the Jetavana Monastery in Sàvatthi, forty- five yojanas away from Ràjagaha. Mahà Moggallàna, by his supernormal power, then took both Kosiya and his wife together with their basket of pancakes, to the presence of the Buddha. There, they offered the pancakes to the Buddha and the five hundred monks. At the end of the meal, the Buddha delivered a discourse on charity, and both Kosiya and his wife attained sotàpatti fruition. The next evening, while the monks were talking in praise of Mahà Moggallàna, the Buddha came to them and said, “Monks, you should also dwell and act in the village like Mahà Moggallàna, receiving the offerings of the villag- ers without affecting their faith and generosity or their wealth.” Explanatory Translation (Verse 49) yathà api bhamaro pupphaü vaõõagandhaü aheñhayaü rasaü àdàya paleti evaü munã gàme care"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"248 yathà api : just as; bhamaro : the bee; pupphaü : flower; vaõõa- gandhaü : colour and the fragrance; aheñhayaü : without harming; rasaü : the nectar; àdàya : taking; paleti : makes bear fruit; evaü munã : this way the silent sage; gàme care : should go about in the village The bee extracts honey from flowers without damaging either the colour or the fragrance of the flower and in so doing helps the tree bear much fruit.

The bee, while extracting honey from flowers, pollinates them, without harming them in the least. While seeking alms, the silent sage is also doing a favour to the people spiritually. The merit that he earns through his practice is shared with the people who support his survival. The donors gain much merit which brings them happiness here and hereafter.

So she put the matter to the naked ascetic, saying, “Noble sir, I desire to go and hear the Buddha.” But as often as she made her request, the naked ascetic dissuaded her from going, saying, “Do not go.” The woman thought to herself, “Since this Naked Ascetic will not permit me to go to the monastery and hear the Dhamma, I will invite the Buddha to my own house and hear the dis- course right here.” Accordingly, when it was evening, she summoned her own son and sent him to the Buddha, saying to him, “Go, invite the Buddha to accept my hospitality for tomorrow.” The boy started out, but went first to the place of residence of the naked ascetic, greeted him, and sat down.

The neighbours smeared that house with cow-dung, decked it with the five kinds of flowers, including the Làjà flower, and prepared a seat of great price, that the Buddha might sit therein. The Buddha, very early in the morning, took the bowl and robe and went straight to the house of the great female lay disciple. When the Buddha had finished his meal, the female lay disciple listened to the Dhamma and applauded the Buddha, saying, ‘Well said! Well said!” The naked ascetic said to the lay disciple, “You are lost for applauding this man thus.” And he reviled both the female lay disciple and the Buddha in all manner of ways, and then ran off. The Buddha asked her, “Lay disciple, are you unable to fix your mind on my discourse?” “Good and Revered Sir,” she replied, “My mind is completely distraught by the insulting words of this naked ascetic.” Said the Buddha, “One should not consider the talk of such a heretic; one should regard only one’s own sins of commission and omission.” Explanatory Translation (Verse 50) paresaü vilomàni na , paresaü katàkataü na , attano eva katàni akatàni ca avekkheyya"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"252 paresaü : of others; vilomàni : fault-findings; na : do not (regard); paresaü : of others; katàkataü : things done and not done; na : do not regard; attano eva : only one’s own; katàni akatàni ca : omissions and commissions; avekkheyya : examine carefully (scrutinize) Do not find fault with others.

At Sàvatthi lived a lay disciple named Chattapàni, versed in the Tripitaka, enjoying the fruit of the second path. Early one morning, in observance of fasting, he went to pay his respects to the Buddha. For those who enjoy the fruition of the second path and those who are noble disciples, by reason of their previous undertaking, they do not take upon themselves the obliga- tions of fast-day. Such persons, solely by virtue of the Path, lead the holy life and eat but one meal a day. Therefore said the Buddha, “Great king, Ghañãkàra the potter eats but one meal a day, leads the holy life, is virtuous and upright.” Thus, as a matter of course, those who enjoy the fruition of the sec- ond path eat but one meal a day and lead the holy life. Chattapàni also, thus observing the fast, approached the Buddha, paid obeisance to him, and sat down and listened to the Dhamma. Now at this time King Pasenadi Kosala also came to pay his respects to the Buddha. When Chattapàni saw him coming, he reflected, “Shall I rise to meet him or not?” He came to the following conclusion, “Since I am seated in the presence of the Buddha, I am not called upon to rise on seeing the king of one of his provinces. Even if he becomes angry, I will not rise. For if I rise on seeing the king, the king will be honoured, and not the Buddha. Therefore I will not"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"255 rise.” Therefore Chattapàni did not rise. (Wise men never become angry when they see a man remain seated, instead of rising, in the presence of those of higher rank.) But when King Pasenadi saw that Chattapàni did not rise, his heart was filled with anger. However, he paid obei- sance to the Buddha and sat down respectfully on one side. The Buddha, observing that he was angry, said to him, “Great king, this lay disciple Chattapàni is a wise man, knows the Dhamma, is versed in the Tripitaka, is contented both in pros- perity and adversity.” Thus did the Buddha extol the lay dis- ciple’s good qualities. As the king listened to the Buddha’s praise of the lay disciple, his heart softened. Now one day after breakfast, as the king stood on the upper floor of his palace, he saw the lay disciple Chattapàni pass through the courtyard of the royal palace with a parasol in his hand and sandals on his feet. Straightaway he caused him to be summoned before him. Chattapàni laid aside his parasol and sandals, approached the king, paid obeisance to him, and took his stand respect- fully on one side. Said the king to Chattapàni, “Lay disciple, why did you lay aside your parasol and sandals?” “When I heard the words, ‘The king summons you,’ I laid aside my parasol and sandals before coming into his presence.” “Evi- dently, then, you have today learned that I am king.” “I always knew that you were king.” “If that be true, then why was it that the other day, when you were seated in the presence of the Buddha and saw me, did you not rise?” “Great king, as I was seated in the presence of the Buddha, to have risen on seeing a king of one of his provinces, I should have shown disrespect for the Buddha. Therefore did I not rise.” “Very well, let bygones be bygones.

Improper and proper alike are grave matters in this case, your majesty.” “Say not so. The other day, when you saw me, you saw fit not to rise. Do not add insult to injury.” “Your maj- esty, it is a censurable act for householders to go about per- forming the functions of monks. Send for someone who is a monk and ask him to recite the Dhamma.” The king dismissed him, saying, “Very well, sir, you may go.” Having so done, he sent a messenger to the Buddha with the following request, “Venerable, my consorts Mallikà and Vàsabhakhattiyà say, ‘We desire to master the Dhamma.’ Therefore come to my house regularly with five hundred monks and preach the Dhamma.” The Buddha sent the fol- lowing reply, “Great king, it is impossible for me to go regu- larly to any one place.” In that case, Venerable, send some monk.” The Buddha assigned the duty to the Venerable ânanda. And the Venerable came regularly and recited the Dhamma to those queens. Of the two queens, Mallikà learned thoroughly, rehearsed faithfully, and heeded her teacher’s instruction. But Vàsabhakhattiyà did not learn thoroughly, nor did she rehearse faithfully, nor was she able to master the instruction she received. One day the Buddha asked the Venerable ânanda, “ânanda, are your female lay disciples mastering the Law?” “Yes, Venerable.” “Which one learns thoroughly?” “Mallikà learns thoroughly, rehearses faithfully, and can understand thoroughly the instruction she receives.

But its sweet-smell comes only when it is practiced. sagandhakaü : sweet smelling. If a flower is colourful, beautiful to look at and has an alluring fragrance, it has fulfilled its duty as a flower.

The way of the Buddha is not a religion of mere faith. If it were, one has only to depend on external deities or saviours for one’s liberation. But in the instance of the Buddha’s word, the most essential thing is practice. The ‘beauty’ or the ‘sweet-smell’ of the Buddha word comes through practice. If a person merely speaks out the word of the Buddha but does not practice it – if he is an akubbato – he is like a bril- liant hued flower lacking fragrance.

Visàkhà was the daughter of a rich man of Bhaddiya, named Dhananjaya, and his wife Sumanàdevi, and the granddaughter of Meõdaka, one of the five extremely wealthy men of King Bimbisàra’s dominions. When Visàkhà was seven years old, the Buddha came to Bhaddiya. On that occasion, the rich man Meõdaka took Visàkhà and her five hundred companions with him to pay homage to the Buddha. After hearing the discourse given by the Buddha, Visàkhà, her grandfather and all her five hun- dred companions attained sotàpatti fruition. When Visàkhà came of age, she married Puõõavaóóhana, son of Migàra, a fairly rich man from Sàvatthi. One day, while Migàra was having his meal, a monk stopped for alms at his house; but Migàra completely ignored the monk. Visàkhà, seeing this, said to the monk. I am sorry, your reverence, my father-in-law only eats left-overs.” On hearing this, Migàra flew into a rage and told her to leave his house. But Visàkhà said she was not going away, and that she would send for the eight elderly rich men who were sent by her father to accompany her and to advise her. It was for them to decide whether she was guilty or not. When the elders came, Migàra told them the story. The elders decided that Visàkhà was not guilty. Visàkhà then said that she was one who had absolute and unshakable faith in the Teaching of the Buddha and so could not stay where the monks were not welcome;"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"262 and also, that if she was not given permission to invite the monks to the house to offer alms-food and make other offer- ings, she would leave the house. So permission was granted her to invite the Buddha and his monks to the house. The next day, the Buddha and his disciples were invited to the house of Visàkhà. When alms-food was about to be offered, she sent word to her father-in-law to join her in offer- ing food; but he did not come. When the meal was over, again, she sent a message, this time requesting her father-in-law to join her in hearing the discourse that would soon be given by the Buddha. Her father-in-law felt that he should not refuse for a second time. But his ascetic teachers, the Niganñhas, would not let him go, however, they conceded that he could listen from behind a curtain. After hearing the Buddha’s discourse Migàra attained sotàpatti fruition. He felt very thankful to the Buddha and also to his daughter-in-law. Being so thankful, he declared that henceforth Visàkhà would be like a mother to him, and Visàkhà came to be known as Migàramàtà. Visàkhà gave birth to ten sons and ten daughters, and ten sons and ten daughters each were born to everyone of her chil- dren and grand-children. Visàkhà possessed an immensely valuable gem-encrusted ornament given by her father as a wed- ding present. One day, Visàkhà went to the Jetavana Monastery with her entourage. On arrival at the Monastery, she found her bejewelled ornament too heavy. So, she took it off, wrapped it up in her shawl, and gave it to the maid to hold. The maid absent-mindedly left it at the Monastery. It was the custom for the Venerable ânanda to look after the things left by any one of the lay disciples. Visàkhà sent the maid back to the Monastery saying, “Go and look for the bejewelled ornament, but if the Venerable ânanda had already found it and kept it in a place do not bring it back; I donate the bejewelled ornament to the Ven-"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"263 erable ânanda.” But the Venerable ânanda did not accept her donation. So Visàkhà decided to sell it and donate the sale pro- ceeds. But there was no one who could afford to buy that orna- ment. So Visàkhà bought it back for nine billion and one lakh. With this money, she built a monastery on the eastern side of the city; this monastery came to be known as Pubbàràma.

The purpose of life is to make beautiful garlands out of these flowers that beautify the world. The best use of our temporal, mortal life is to do good deeds that bring happiness to everyone.

The story goes: Now one evening the Venerable ânanda arose from pro- found meditation and drew near to the place where sat the Buddha, and when he had drawn near, he addressed the Buddha as follows, “Venerable, there are these three substances whose perfume goes only with the wind and not against the wind. What are the three? The perfume of roots, the perfume of sandal, and the perfume of flowers. These are the three sub- stances whose perfume goes only with the wind and not against the wind.

Commentary On ânanda , a note : The two verses (54 & 55) were spoken by the Buddha in response to a"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"269 question put to him by Venerable ânanda. In the history of Buddhism, Venerable ânanda occupies a crucial place. Most of the discourses spo- ken by the Buddha were recorded by Venerable ânanda. It was he who recounted these discourses to the assembly of monks who gathered at the First Council to confi rm the word of the Buddha. The recurring phrase ‘ evaü me Sutaü .’ (Thus have I heard) which prefaces most of the discourses in the Buddhist scripture, is indicative of the fact that the discourse was recounted by Venerable ânanda, just as he had heard it when the Buddha fi rst spoke. Venerable ânanda was the personal attendant of the Buddha. The body of teaching that is presently characterized as Buddhism is largely the teachings gathered by Venerable ânanda as the constant companion of the Buddha. Venerable ânanda is, at times, referred to as the ‘Treas- urer of the Buddha Word’. How Venerable ânanda came to assume this exalted position has also been extensively recorded in Buddhist literature. The Buddha had no regular attendant during the fi rst twenty years of His ministry. There were several monks who used to attend on the Buddha and accompany Him on the rounds for alms carrying his extra robes and the bowl. The monks who served thus were Nàgasamàla, Nàgita, Upavàna, Sunakkhatta, Cunda, Sàgata, Ràdha, and Meghiya. One day, as the Buddha went on a long journey accompanied by the Venerable Nàgasamàla, and came up to a junction, the monk suggested to take one road, whereas the Buddha suggested the other. The monk did not accept the words of the Buddha, and was about to put the bowl and the robes of the Buddha on the ground before taking the road of his choice. The Buddha asked for the bowl and the robes before they were put on the ground, and took the other road. The monk who went along the road of his choice was robbed of his bowl and robes and was struck on the head by highway robbers. He came back to the Buddha with a bleeding head, to be reminded of his disobedience and consoled by the Buddha. On another day, as the Buddha was on his way to the village of Jantu in the company of the Venerable Meghiya, the latter chose to go to a mango grove and practice meditation, and handed over to the Buddha His bowl and the robes. The Buddha thrice advised him against taking that step, but he went his way. He returned to the Buddha and confessed how he failed in his meditation. When the Buddha came to Sàvatthi, and was in the Jetavana Monastery, he expressed to the assembly of monks His dissat-"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"270 isfaction with the conduct of these monks, and suggested to have a regular attendant as He was advancing in years. The Buddha was over fi fty-fi ve years in age at this time. The Venerable Sàriputta stood up immediately, saluted the Buddha, and volunteered to be the regular personal attendant of the Buddha. The Buddha declined his offer as his services as the foremost disciple of the Buddha was needed elsewhere. Other leading disciples too offered their services. However, they too were not accepted by the Buddha. Then the monks induced the Venerable ânanda, who was so far silent, to offer to serve as the personal attendant of the Buddha. However, he waited to be nominated by the Buddha Himself. The Buddha said: It is not necessary for ânanda to be induced by others. He will serve me on his own accord.” The Venerable ânanda agreed to serve the Buddha regularly, sub- ject to eight conditions. They were: (1) He should not be given the fi ne robes received by the Buddha; (2) He should not be given the delicious food received by the Buddha; (3) He should not be accommodated in the fragrant chamber of the Buddha; (4) He should not be asked to go with the Buddha to accept alms on invitations; (5) The Buddha would consent to invitations accepted by him; (6) Visitors from far off places who came to see the Buddha should be allowed in with him; (7) He should be allowed to consult the Buddha whenever he had any doubt for clarifi cation; and that (8) He should be told the discourses the Buddha preached in his absence. After the Buddha consented to these eight conditions, the Vener- able ânanda became the regular attendant of the Buddha. Thenceforth, he began to attend on the Buddha and serve hot and cold water and three kinds of dental tools. He used to massage the body of the Buddha, and be awakened the whole night, holding a wooden torch, so that he could be summoned by the Buddha at any time. He used to walk nine times round the fragrant chamber every night. He also did the sweeping and cleaning of the fragrant chamber himself. He served and followed the Buddha like His shadow until His passing away, However, the Venerable ânanda did not attain arahathood during the lifetime of the Buddha. He became an arahant a few weeks after the passing away of the Buddha, and was a key fi gure in the First Council of the fi ve hundred arahants who recited the teachings of the Buddha, at the invitation of the Venerable Mahà Kassapa, at Ràjagaha.

One day Venerable Kassapa arose from a meditation which had lasted seven days and started out with the inten- tion of making an unbroken round for alms in Ràjagaha. At the same time five hundred pink-footed nymphs who were the wives of Sakka, king of gods, roused themselves and pre- pared five hundred portions of alms, intending to give those alms to the Venerable. Taking their alms, they halted on the road and said to the Venerable, “Venerable, accept these alms; do us a favour.” The Venerable replied, “Go away, all of you. I intend to favour the poor.” Sakka himself desired to give alms to the Venerable. So he disguised himself as an old weaver worn out by old age, an old man with broken teeth, grey hair, and a bent and broken body. And transforming Wellborn the celestial nymph into just such an old woman, and creating by supernatural power a weavers’ lane, he sat spinning out thread. The Venerable went towards the city, thinking to himself, I will bestow favour on poor folk.” And seeing this street outside of the city, he looked all about and noticed those two persons. At that moment Sakka was spinning out the thread and Wellborn was feeding a shuttle.

Who can he be?” Perceiving that it was Sakka, he said, “You have done a grievous wrong in depriving poor folk of the opportunity to acquire merit. By bestowing alms on me today, any poor man whosoever might obtain the post of commander-in-chief or the post of treasurer.” Is there any man poorer than I, Venerable?” “How do you come to be poor, enjoying as you do the splendour in the world of the gods?” “Venerable, this is the explanation. Before the Buddha appeared in the world I performed works of merit. When the Buddha appeared in the world, three deities of equal rank were reborn who, by the performance of works of merit, possessed greater glory than I. When these deities say in my presence, ‘Let us make holiday,’ and take female slaves and go down into the street, I take to my heels and enter my house. The glory from their persons overpowers my person, but the glory from my person does not overpower their persons. Who, Venerable, is poorer than I?” “If this be true, henceforth do not attempt to deceive me by giving alms to me.” “Have I acquired merit, or have I not acquired merit, by giving alms to you through deception?” “You have acquired merit, brother.” “If th is be t rue, Venerable, it is my bou nden dut y to perform works of merit.” So saying, Sakka saluted the Venerable, and accom- panied by Sujàtà, circumbulated the Venerable."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"274 Explanatory Translation (Verse 56) yo ayaü tagara candanã ayaü gandho appamatto , sãlavataü yo ca gandho uttamo devesu vàti yo ayaü : whatever this; tagara candanã : fragrance associ- ated with lavender and sandal wood; ayaü : that (fra- grance); appamatto : is only a little; sãlavataü : of the virtu- ous; yo ca gandho : if there is a sweet smell; uttamo : that is supreme; devesu : in the midst of the devas or heavenly worlds; vàti : (it) spreads The fragrance of tagara and sandalwood is quite slight.

A second time and a third time, and unto six times, did he enter into a state of mental repose and fell away therefrom. As he entered into a state of mental repose for the seventh time, he thought to himself, “Six times I have fallen away from a state of mental repose. Doubtful is the future state of him who falls away from a state of mental repose. Now is the time for me to use the razor.” Accordingly, he took the razor with which he shaved his hair, and lay down on his bed, intending to end his life.

Such men, having attained penetration, win Arahatship. But if I try to prevent him from carrying out his intention, he will pay no attention to my words.

Thought he, “Where has his rebirth-consciousness fixed itself?” The Buddha pointed out to the monks the pillar of smoke and the mass of darkness and said to them, “Monks, that is Màra, the Evil One, searching for the consciousness of the goodly youth Godhika. Thinks he, ‘Where has the consciousness of the goodly youth Godhika fixed itself?’ But, monks, the con- sciousness of the goodly youth Godhika has not fixed itself. For, monks, the goodly youth Godhika has passed into Nib- bàna. Màra, being unable to find the place where the con- sciousness of the Venerable had fixed itself, approached the Buddha and asked him, “Where has Godhika gone?” Said the Buddha to Màra, “Godhika has uprooted crav- ing and has attained Nibbàna.” Then said the Buddha, “Evil One, what have you to do with the place where the conscious- ness of the goodly youth Godhika has fixed itself?

At Sàvatthi there once lived two friends, Sirigutta and Garahadinna. The former was a lay disciple of the Buddha, the latter an adherent of the Naked Ascetics, the Niganñhas. The naked ascetics used to say repeatedly to Garahadinna, “Go to your friend Sirigutta and say ‘Why do you visit the monk Gotama? What do you expect to get from him?’ Why not admonish him thus, that he may visit us and give us alms?” Garahadinna listened to what they said, went repeatedly to Sirigutta, and wherever he found him, standing or sitting, spoke thus to him, “Friend, of what use to you is the monk Gotama? What do you expect to get by visiting him? Should you not visit my own noble teachers instead and give alms to them?” Sirigutta listened to his friend’s talk and despite it kept silence for several days. One day, however, he lost his patience and said to Garahadinna, “Friend, you constantly come to me, and wherever you find me, standing or sitting, speak thus to me, ‘What do you expect to gain by visiting the monk Gotama? Visit my noble teachers instead and give alms to them.’ Now just answer me this question, ‘What do your noble teachers know?’” “Oh, sir, do not speak thus!

Not until today did I learn of the supernatural power of know- ledge possessed by your noble teachers. Go, sir, and invite your noble teachers in my name.” Garahadinna went to the naked ascetics, paid obeisance to them, and said, “My friend Sirigutta invites you for tomor- row.” “Did Sirigutta speak to you of himself?” “Yes, noble sirs.” They were pleased and delighted. Said they, “Our work is done. What gain will not accrue to us from the moment Sirigutta has complete faith in us?” Now Sirigutta’s place of residence was a large one, and in one place there was a long empty space between two houses. Here, therefore, he caused a long ditch to be dug, and this ditch he caused to be filled with dung and slime. Beyond the ditch, at both ends, he caused posts to be driven into the ground, and to these posts he caused ropes to be attached. He caused the seats to be so placed, with the front legs resting on the ground and the back legs resting on the ropes, that the instant the heretics sat down they would be tipped over back- wards and flung head first into the ditch. In order that no sign of a ditch might be visible, he had coverlets spread over the seats. He caused several large earthenware vessels to be washed clean, and their mouths to be covered with banana leaves and pieces of cloth. And these vessels, empty though they were, he caused to be placed behind the house, smeared on the outside with rice-porridge, lumps of boiled rice, ghee, palm sugar and cake-crumbs. Early in the morning Garahadinna went quickly to the house of Sirigutta and asked him, “Has food been prepared"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"282 for my noble teachers?” “Yes, friend, food has been prepared.” “But where is it?” In all these earthenware vessels is rice- porridge, in all these is boiled rice, in all these are ghee, palm sugar, cakes, and other kinds of food. Likewise have seats been prepared.” “Very well,” said Garahadinna, and went his way. As soon as Garahadinna had departed, five hundred naked ascetics arrived. Sirigutta came forth from the house, paid obeisance to the naked ascetics, and taking his stand before them, and raising his clasped hands in an attitude of reverent salutation, thought to himself, “So you know all about the past, the present, and the future! So at least your supporter tells me. If you really do know all this, do not enter my house. For even if you enter my house, there is no rice- porridge prepared for you, nor boiled rice, nor any other kind of food. If you do not know all this and still enter my house, I will cause you to be flung into a ditch filled with dung, and will then cause you to be beaten with sticks.” Having thus reflected, he gave the following order to his men, “When you observe that they are about to sit down, take your places in the rear and pull the coverlets which are spread over the seats out from under, lest the coverlets be smeared with filth.” As Sirigutta thought, the naked ascetics were unaware of what had been planned. They fell into the ditch and were disgraced. Garahadinna, planning to take revenge, invited the Buddha. The Buddha, accompanied by five hundred monks, went to the house of Garahadinna and stood before the door. Garahadinna came forth from the house, paid obeisance to the monks with the five rests, and taking his stand before them and raising his clasped hands in an attitude of reverent salutation, thought to himself, “So, Venerable, you know all"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"59. ...Evaü saïkàrabhåtesu andhabhåte puthujjane atirocati pa¤¤àya Sammàsambuddhasàvako.

Instead I will cause you to be flung into a charcoal-pit and will bring humiliation upon you.” But, contrary to his thought, a miracle happened. Lotus flowers as big as cart wheels sprang up, rending the charcoal- pit asunder. “What am I to do?” Garahadinna asked Sirigutta. “Did you not just now point out to me certain earthenware ves- sels and say, ‘All these vessels are filled with rice-porridge; all these are filled with boiled rice,’ and so forth?” “What I said was false, master. The vessels are empty.” “Never mind. Go look at the rice-porridge and other kinds of food in those ves- sels.” At that instant the vessels over which he spoke the word “rice-porridge” were filled with rice-porridge, the vessels over which he spoke the words “boiled rice” were filled with boiled rice, and so it happened likewise with the other vessels. When Garahadinna saw this miracle, he was filled with joy and happiness and his heart was filled with faith. With profound reverence he waited on the congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha. The meal over, Garahadinna, indicating that he wished the Buddha to speak the words of thanksgiving, took his bowl. Thus Garahadinna was con- verted into a faithful disciple of the Buddha.

Then, the king came to realize the wickedness of the deed and the severity of the punishment.

Its continuity is not welcomed by a Buddhist. The Buddhist goal is ‘immortality’ or ‘deathlessness’ which is the only possible reality, which is quite dis- tinct from ‘eternal life’.

While Venerable Kassapa was in residence at Pipphali Cave, he had two pupils learning under him. One of these performed his duties faithfully, but the other frequently shirked his duties and sought to take credit for work done by the other. For example, the faithful pupil would set out water for washing the face, and a tooth-stick. Knowing this, the faithless pupil would go to the Venerable and say, “Venerable, water for washing the face is set out, and a tooth-stick. Go wash your face.” When it was time to prepare water for bath- ing the feet and for the bath, he would pursue the same tac- tics.

Of course I thought there was water in the bathroom and went and told the Venerable so.” Disappointed, he took a water-jar and went to the bathing-place at the river. Venerable Kassapa thought, ‘All this time this young fel- low has been shirking from his duties and has sought to take credit for work really done by his brother-pupil.” On the fol- lowing day he refused to accompany the Venerable on his rounds. The Venerable therefore took his other pupil with him to a certain place. While he was away, the faithless pupil went to the house of a layman who was a supporter of the Venerable. The lay- man asked him, “Where is the monk?” The Venerable doesn’t feel well, and therefore remained at the Monastery.” “What then should he have, Venerable?” “Give him such and such food,” said the youth, pretending that the monk had told him to ask for it. Accordingly they prepared food such as he asked for, and gave it to him. He took the food, ate it on the way back, and returned to the Monastery.

There was once a very wealthy man named ânanda in Sàvatthi. Although he possessed eighty billion, he was very reluctant to give anything in charity. To his son, Målasiri, he used to say, “Don’t think the wealth we have now is very much. Do not give away anything from what you have, for you must make it grow. Otherwise, your wealth will dwindle.” This rich man had five pots of gold buried in his house and he died without revealing their location to his son. ânanda, the rich man, was reborn in a village of beggars, not far from Sàvatthi. From the time his mother was pregnant, the income of the beg- gars decreased; the villagers thought there must be a wicked and unlucky one amongst them. By dividing themselves up into groups and by the process of elimination, they came to the conclusion that the pregnant beggar woman must be the unfortunate one. Thus, she was driven out of the village. When her son was born, the son proved to be extremely ugly and repulsive. His hands and feet and eyes and ears and nose and mouth were not where they should have been. Ter- rible looking that he was, he looked like a mud spirit.

Now we can sup- port you no longer. In this city meals are provided for poor folk and travellers. Get your living by begging for alms in this town.” As he wandered about in Sàvatthi, he remembered his old house and his past existence. So he went into the house. When the sons of his son Målasiri saw him, they were fright- ened by his ugly looks and began to cry. The servants then beat him and threw him out of the house. The Buddha who was on his alms-round saw the inci- dent and asked Venerable ânanda to fetch Målasiri. When Målasiri came, the Buddha told him that the young beggar was his own father in his previous existence. But Målasiri could not believe it. So, the Buddha directed the beggar boy to show where he had buried his five pots of gold. Then only, Målasiri accepted the truth and from that time he became a devoted lay-disciple of the Buddha.

The story goes that these two men, who were lucky companions, accompanied a great throng to Jetavana to hear the Buddha. One of them listened to the Teaching, the other watched for a chance to steal something. The first, through listening to the Teaching ‘Entered the Stream’; the second found five coins tied to the belt of a certain man and stole the money. The thief had food cooked as usual in his house, but there was no cooking done in the house of his companion. His comrade the thief, and likewise the thief’s wife, ridiculed him, saying, “You are so excessively wise that you cannot obtain money enough to have regular meals cooked in your own house.” He who entered the stream thought to himself, “This man, just because he is a fool, does not think that he is a fool.” And going to Jetavana with his kinsfolk, he told the Buddha of the incident.

The implication of this stanza is that the true wisdom is found in the awareness of reality. If one is aware of one’s own foolishness, that awareness makes him wise. The basis of true wisdom is the right knowledge of things as they really are. Those who are foolish but are given to believe that they are wise are truly foolish because that basi- cally false awareness colours the totality of their thinking. bàlo : the foolish person. Foolishness is the result of confusion ( moha ) and unawareness ( avijjà ). Unawareness is the primary root of all evil and suffering in the world, veiling man’s mental eyes and preventing him from seeing his own true nature. It carries with it the delusion which tricks beings by making life appear to them as permanent, happy, personal and desirable. It prevents them from seeing that eve- rything in reality is impermanent, liable to suffering, void of ‘I’ and ‘Mine,’ and basically undesirable. Unawareness ( avijjà ) is defined as “not knowing the four Truths; namely, suffering, its origin, its cessa- tion, and the way to its cessation”. As avijjà is the foundation of all evil and suffering, it stands first in the formula of Dependent Origination. Avijjà should not be regarded as ‘the causeless cause of all things. It has a cause too. The cause of it is stated thus: ‘With the arising of àsava there is the arising of avijjà . The Buddha said, “No first beginning of avijjà can be per-"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"302 ceived, before which avijjà was not, and after which it came to be. But it can be perceived that avijjà has its specific condition.” As unawareness ( avijjà ) still exists, even in a very subtle way, until the attainment of Arahatship or perfection, it is counted as the last of the ten Fetters which bind beings to the cycle of rebirths. As the first two Roots of Evil, greed and hate are on their part rooted in unawareness and consequently all unwholesome states of mind are inseparably bound up with it, confusion ( moha ) is the most obstinate of the three Roots of Evil. Avijjà is one of the àsavas (influences) that motivate behaviour. It is often called an obscurant but does not appear together with the usual list of five obscurants . Unawareness ( avijjà ) of the truth of suffering, its cause, its end, and the way to its end, is the chief cause that sets the cycle of life ( saüsàra ) in motion. In other words, it is the not-knowingness of things as they truly are, or of oneself as one really is. It clouds all right understanding. “ Avijjà is the blinding obscurant that keeps us trapped in this cycle of rebirth” says the Buddha. When unawareness is destroyed and turned into awareness, the “chain of causation” is shattered as in the case of the Buddhas and Arahats. In the Itivuttaka the Buddha states “Those who have destroyed avijjà and have broken through the dense darkness of avijjà , will tour no more in saüsàra ."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"64.

Now one day some visiting monks saw him there, and thinking to themselves, “This must be the Buddha,” asked him some questions about the aggregates of being and other matters.

Commentary dabbã : the spoon. The Buddha has presented in this stanza a very vivid image of what is being said by him. Dabbã – the spoon, stirs dishes. In the course of its work the spoon comes into intimate contact with all forms of foodstuff. The spoon turns left and right, up and down, turning the food this way and that. The spoon continues to do this for all forms of dishes – sweet, sour, astringent, etc. The spoon goes on for ages until it decays. But the point made by the Buddha is that, after that, the spoon does not know the taste of food. This is a very apt image to show what happens to a foolish person who associ- ates with the wise over a lifetime. He does not derive even an iota of profit for all that association. Dhamma : the term Dhamma (meaning “experience”) takes on numer- ous meanings. The meaning which is foremost in popular Buddhism is ‘the Word of the Buddha’. The Buddha taught the world what he ‘experienced’. The process through which the world came to know about this ‘experience’ was the Word of the Buddha, which is called Buddhadhamma, which has been recounted extensively in Buddhist scriptures. Immediately on Enlightenment, he was absorbed in soli- tary meditation. At that time, the following thought occurred to him, “This ‘experience’, which I have realized, is indeed profound, difficult to perceive, difficult to comprehend, tranquil, exalted, not within the sphere of logic, subtle, and is to be understood by the wise. These beings are attached to material pleasures. This causally connected ‘Dependent Arising’ is a subject which is difficult to comprehend. And this Nibbàna – the cessation of the conditioned, the abandoning of all passions, the destruction of craving, the non-attachment, and the ces-"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"306 sation – is also a matter not easily comprehensible. If I were to teach this ‘experience’ (Dhamma), others would not understand me. That will be only weariness to me, that will be tiredness to me.” Then these wonderful verses unheard of before occurred to the Buddha: “With difficulty have I comprehended the Dhamma. There is no need to proclaim it now. This Dhamma is not easily understood by those who are dominated by lust and hatred. The lust-ridden masses, shrouded in darkness, do not see this Dhamma, which goes against the stream, which is not easy to understand, profound, difficult to perceive and subtle.” As the Buddha reflected thus, he was not disposed to expound the Dhamma. Thereupon Brahma Sahampati (believed by Bràhmins to be the creator of the world) read the thoughts of the Buddha, and, fearing that the world might perish through not hearing the dhamma, approached Him and invited Him to teach the Dhamma thus: “O Lord, may the Buddha expound the Dhamma! May the Buddha expound the Dhamma! There are beings with little dust in their eyes, who, not hearing the Dhamma, fall away. There will be those who understand the Dhamma.” Furthermore, he remarked, “In ancient times there arose in Magadha a Dhamma, impure, thought out by the corrupted. Open this door to the Deathless State. May they hear the Dhamma understood by the Stainless One! Just as one standing on the summit of a rocky mountain would behold the people around, even so may the All-Seeing, Wise One who has ascended this palace of Dhamma, may the Sorrowless One, look upon the people who are plunged in grief and are overcome by birth and decay! “Rise, O Hero, victor in battle, caravan leader, debt-free One, and go out into the World! May the Buddha teach the Dhamma! There will be those who will under- stand the Dhamma.” When the bràhmin said so, the Exalted One spoke to him thus: “The following thought, O Brahma, occurred to me – ‘This Dhamma which I have comprehended is not easily under- stood by those who are dominated by lust and hatred. The lust-ridden masses, shrouded in darkness, do not see this Dhamma, which goes"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"307 against the stream, which is abstruse, profound, difficult to perceive, and subtle’. As I reflected thus, my mind turned to inaction and to not teaching the Dhamma.” Brahma Sahampati appealed to the Buddha for the second time and He made the same reply. When he appealed to the Buddha for the third time, the Buddha, out of compassion for beings, surveyed the world with His Buddha-Vision. As he surveyed thus, He saw beings with little and much dust in their eyes, with keen and dull intellect, with good and bad characteristics, beings who are easy and beings who are difficult to teach, and few others who view evil with fear, and believe in a life beyond. As in the case of a blue, red or white lotus pond, some lotuses are born in the water, grow in the water, remain immersed in the water, and thrive plunged in the water; some are born in the water, grow in the water and remain on the sur- face of the water; some others are born in the water, grow in the water and emerging out of the water, stand uncontaminated by the water. Even so, as the Buddha surveyed the world with His Buddha-Vision, He saw beings with little and much dust in their eyes, with keen and dull intellect, with good and bad characteristics, beings who are easy and difficult to be taught, and few others who view evil with fear, and believe in a life beyond. Having seen this, he set out to preach his gospel, out of compassion for all suffering beings. Buddha’s doctrine was initiated this way.

But hear- ing the religious instruction of Venerable Tuõóila in the Tuõóila Jàtaka, they perceived the Dhamma very quickly and took upon themselves the five precepts.

Here vi¤¤àna implies intelligence. Cognition is one of the five aggregates; one of the four nutriments; the third link of the dependent origination; the fifth in a sixfold division of elements. Viewed as one of the five groups, it is inseparably linked with the three other mental groups (feeling, per- ception and formations) and furnishes the bare cognition of the object, while the other three contribute more specific functions. Its ethical and karmic character, and its greater or lesser degree of intensity and clarity, are chiefly determined by the mental formations associated with it. Just as the other groups of existence, consciousness is a flux and does not constitute an abiding mind-substance; nor is it a transmigrating entity or soul. The three characteristics, impermanence, suffering and not-self, are frequently applied to it in the texts. The Buddha often stressed that “apart from conditions, there is no arising of consciousness”: and all these statements about its nature hold good for the entire range of conscious- ness, be it past, future or presently arisen, gross or subtle, in one’s self or external, inferior or lofty, far or near. According to the six senses it divides into six kinds, viz. eye- (or visual) consciousness, etc. About the dependent arising of these six kinds of consciousness, “Conditioned through the eye, the visible object, light and attention, eye-consciousness arises. Conditioned through the ear, the audible object, the ear-passage and attention, ear-consciousness arises. Conditioned through the nose, the olfactory object, air and atten- tion, nose-consciousness arises. Conditioned through the tongue, the gustative object, humidity and attention, tongue-consciousness arises. Conditioned through the body, bodily impression, the earth-element and attention, body-consciousness arises. Conditioned through the sub- conscious mind, the mind-object, and attention, mind-consciousness arises.” The Abhidhamma literature distinguishes eighty-nine classes of consciousness, being either karmically wholesome, unwholesome or neutral, and belonging either to the sense-sphere, the fine-material or the immaterial sphere, or to supermundane consciousness."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"66.

A florist, named Sumana, had to supply King Bimbisàra of Ràjagaha with jasmine flowers every morning. One day, as he was going to the king’s palace he saw the Buddha, with a radiating halo of light-rays, coming into town for alms-food accompanied by many monks. Seeing the Buddha in his resplendent glory, the florist Sumana felt a strong desire to offer his flowers to the Buddha. Then and there, he decided that even if the king were to drive him out of the country or to kill him, he would not offer the flowers to the king for that day. Thus, he threw up the flowers to the sides, to the back and over and above the head of the Buddha. The flowers remained hanging in the air; those over the head formed a canopy of flowers and those at the back and the sides formed walls of flowers. These flowers followed the Buddha in this position as he moved on, and stopped when the Buddha stopped. As the Buddha proceeded, surrounded by walls of flowers, and a canopy of flowers, with the six-coloured rays radiating from his body, followed by a large entourage, thousands of people inside and outside of Ràjagaha came out of their houses to pay obeisance to the Buddha.

The king served the congregation of monks with choice food. At the conclusion of the meal the Buddha returned thanks, and surrounded as before by four sides of flowers and accompanied by a great multitude of people shouting in exultation, proceeded to the Monastery. The king accompanied the Buddha a little way and turned back. Then he sent for the florist and asked him, “What did you say when you honoured the Buddha?” The florist replied, “Your majesty, I surrendered my life to him and honoured him, saying, ‘The king may kill me or banish me from his kingdom.’” The king said, “You are a great man.” So saying, he presented him with eight elephants, eight horses, eight male slaves, eight female slaves, eight magnifi- cent sets of jewels, eight thousand pieces of money, eight women taken from the royal harem, adorned with all the adornments, and eight choice villages.

Once there was a young daughter of a rich man in Sàvat- thi. Because she was so beautiful, with looks so tender and sweet, like a blue lotus flower, she was called “Uppalavaõõà”, the blue lotus. The fame of her beauty spread far and wide and there were many suitors: princes, rich men and many others. Thereupon, the merchant, her father, thought to him- self, I shall not be able to satisfy the wishes of all, but I must find some way out of the difficulty.” Now she was in her last existence before attaining Nibbàna and therefore her father’s words were, to her, like oil a hundred times refined sprinkled on her head. Therefore she replied, “Dear father, I’ll become a nun.” So he prepared rich gifts in her honour, and conducted her to the community of nuns where she was admitted. One day, her turn came to unlock and lock the hall of compassion. After she had lighted the lamp and swept the hall, her attention was attracted to the flame of the lamp. She concentrated on the flame. Her attention on the element of fire, she entered into a state of trance. She attained arahat- ship. Some time later, she moved to the Dark Forest (Andha- vana) and lived in solitude.

Nanda had"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"326 fallen in love with Uppalavaõõà before she became a nun; his intention obviously was to take her by force.

Hardly had she seated herself on the bed when the youth crawled out from under the sofa and climbed on top. The nun cried out, “Fool, do not ruin me!” But the youth overcame her resistance, worked out his will over her, and went his way. As if unable to endure his wickedness, the great earth burst asunder, and he was swallowed up and reborn in the great Hell of Avãci. The nun told the other nuns what had happened, and the nuns told the monks, and the monks told the Buddha. Having heard this, the Buddha addressed the monks as fol- lows, “Monks, the simpleton, whoever he may be, whether monk or nun, or lay disciple male or female, who commits an act of sin, acts with as much joy and happiness, with as much pleasure and delight, as though he were eating honey or sugar or some other sweet-tasting substance.” Then he said, “Monks, they that have rid themselves of the corruptions, neither like the pleasures of love nor gratify their passions. For, even as a drop of water which has fallen upon a lotus-leaf does not cling thereto or remain thereon, but crawls over and falls off, precisely so love does not cling to the heart of one who has rid himself of the corruptions.

Jambuka was the son of a rich man in Sàvatthi. Due to his past evil deeds he was born with very peculiar habits. As a child, he wanted to sleep on the floor with no proper bed, and take his own excrement for food instead of rice. When he grew older, his parents sent him to the àjivakas , the naked ascetics. When those ascetics found out about his peculiar food habits they drove him away. In the nights he ate human excrement and in the day time stood still on one leg and kept his mouth open. He used to say that he kept his mouth open because he only lived on air and that he stood on one leg because it would otherwise be too heavy for the earth to bear him. “I never sit down, I never go to sleep,” he boasted and on account of this, he was known as Jambuka, a jackal. Many people believed him and some would come to him with offerings of choice food. Then Jambuka would refuse and say, “I do not take any food except air.” When pressed, he would take just a little of the food with the tip of a blade of grass and say, “Now go, this little food will give you enough merit.” In this way, Jambuka lived for fifty-five years, naked and taking only excreta. One day, the Buddha saw in his vision that Jambuka was due to attain arahatship within a short time. So, in the"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"330 evening, the Buddha went to where Jambuka was staying and asked for some place to spend the night. Jambuka pointed out to him a mountain-cave not far from the stone slab on which he himself was staying. During the first, second and third watches of the night, the Càtummahàràjikà devàs, Sakka and Mahàbrahma came to pay homage to the Buddha in turn. On all the three occasions, the forest was lit up and Jambuka saw the light three times. In the morning, he walked over to the Buddha and enquired about the lights. When told about the devàs, Sakka and Mahàbrahma coming to pay homage to the Buddha, Jambuka was very much impressed, and said to the Buddha, “You must, indeed, be a wonderful person for the devàs, Sakka and Mahàbrahma to come and pay homage to you. As for me, even though I have practiced austerely for fifty-five years, living only on air and standing only on one leg, none of the devàs, nor Sakka, nor Mahàbrahma has ever came to me.” To him, the Buddha replied “O Jambuka! You have been deceiving other people, but you cannot deceive me. I know that for fifty-five years you have been eating excrement and sleeping on the ground.” Hearing that, Jambuka was horrified and terror-stricken, and repented for having done evil and for having deceived other people. He went down on his knees and the Buddha gave him a piece of cloth to put on. The Buddha then pro- ceeded to deliver a discourse; at the end of which Jambuka attained arahatship and joined the Buddhist Sangha.

The ghost said, “In a former state of existence I took three mouthfuls of food meant for venerables. As a result of that misdeed, when I died, I suffered torment in the Avãci Hell and thereafter, because the result of my evil deed was not yet exhausted, I was reborn on Vulture Peak as a crow- ghost.

Once upon a time, there lived in Benares a cripple who was an adept at the art of slinging stones. He used to sit at the city-gate under a certain banyan-tree, sling stones, and cut the leaves of the tree. The boys of the city would say to him, “Make an elephant for us, make a horse for us;” and he would make every animal they asked him to. As a reward he received from them food both hard and soft. One day, as the king was on his way to the pleasure-garden, he came to this place. The boys left the cripple within the shoots of the banyan-tree and ran away. Now it was noon when the king stopped and went in among the roots of the tree, and his body was overspread with the chequered shade. “What does this mean?” said he, looking up. Seeing leaves cut in the forms of elephants and horses, he asked, “Whose work is this?” On being informed that it was the work of the cripple, he sent for him. Happy with the cripple’s serv- ice the king gave him the eight-fold gifts, and four fine large villages, north, east, south, and west of the city. Now a certain man, observing the worldly prosperity won by the cripple, thought to himself, “This man, born a cripple, has won great prosperity through this art. I also ought to learn this art.” He learnt it. Now at that time a solitary Buddha named Sunetta resided in a shelter of leaves and grass near the city.

The solitary Buddha suffered intense pain, was unable to continue his alms-round, and returning to his shelter of leaves through the air, passed into Nibbàna. The people said, “This wicked fellow says that he hit the Private Buddha. Catch him!” And straightaway they beat him and then and there killed him. He was reborn in the Avãci Hell. Until this great earth was elevated a league, during all that time he suffered torment.

A householder named Citta, residing in the city of Mac- chikàsanóa, observed the Venerable Mahànàma, one of the band of five, making his round for alms; and pleased with his deportment, took his bowl, invited him into his house, pro- vided him with food, and at the conclusion of the meal lis- tened to the law and obtained the fruit of conversion.

Very early in the morning the Venerable Sudhamma thought to himself, ‘What manner of food has the householder prepared for the chief disciples?

The Buddha, although he knew that the house- holder would pardon Sudhamma, thought, “This Venerable is stubborn in his pride; now let him go thirty leagues and come back.” And so, without telling him how he might gain pardon, he just dismissed him. The Venerable returned with pride humbled. The Buddha then gave the Venerable a companion and said to the Venerable, “Go with this companion and ask pardon of the householder.” Said the Buddha, “A religious person ought not to give way to pride or ill-will, thinking, ‘This residence is mine, this male lay disciple is mine, this female lay disciple is mine.’ For if he so did, ill-will and pride and the other depravities increase.” After listening to this admonition Venerable Sudhamma bowed to the Buddha, rose from his seat, circumambulated the Buddha, and then, accompanied by his companion-monk, went within sight of the lay disciple, atoned for his fault, and begged the disciple’s pardon.

Tissa was the son of a rich man from Sàvatthi. His father used to offer alms-food to the chief disciple Sàriputta in their house and so Tissa even as a child had met the chief disciple on many occasions. At the age of seven he became a novice under the chief disciple Sàriputta. While he was staying at the Jetavana Monastery, many of his friends and relatives came to see him, bringing presents and offerings. The novice monk found these visits to be very tiresome; so after taking a subject of meditation from the Buddha, he left for a forest monastery. Whenever a villager offered him anything, Tissa would just say ‘May you be happy, may you be liberated from the ills of life,’ (“ Sukhità hotha, dukkhà muccatha ”), and would go on his own way. While he stayed at the forest monastery, he ardently and diligently practiced meditation, and at the end of three months he attained arahatship. After the vassa (the rainy season), the Venerable Sàriputta, accompanied by the Venerable Mahà Moggallàna and other senior disciples, paid a visit to novice monk Tissa, with the permission of the Buddha.

But the Venerable Sàriputta insisted that Tissa should deliver a discourse on the Dhamma, and said to Tissa, “Tissa, talk to them about the Dhamma and show them how to gain happiness and how to be liberated from the ills of life.” Thus, in obedience to his teacher, Novice Monk Tissa went up the platform to deliver his discourse. He explained to the audience the meaning of the aggregates ( khandhàs ), sense bases and sense objects ( àyatanas ), elements of the perpetua- tion of the Teaching ( Bodhipakkhiya ), the path leading to ara- hatship and Nibbàna, etc. Finally he concluded, “And thus, those who attain arahatship are liberated from all the ills of life and have perfect peace; all the rest will still wander about in the round of rebirths. The Venerable Sàriputta praised Tissa for having expounded the Dhamma so well. Dawn was approaching when he finished his exposition, and all the villagers were very much impressed. Some of them were surprised that nov- ice monk Tissa knew the Dhamma so well, but formerly he had talked so little about the Dhamma to them; the others were happy and contented to find the novice monk to be so learned and felt that they were very lucky to have him amongst them."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"349 Explanatory Translation (Verse 75) làbhåpanisà a¤¤à hi nibbànagàminã a¤¤à hi evaü Buddhassa sàvako bhikkhu etaü abhi¤¤àya sakkàraü na abhinandeyya vivekaü anubråhaye làbhåpanisà : the strategy to earn worldly profit; a¤¤à hi : is one; nibbànagàminã : the path to liberation; a¤¤à hi : (is) cer- tainly yet another; evaü Buddhassa sàvako : thus Buddha’s disciple; bhikkhu : the monk; etaü : this matter; abhi¤¤àya : appreciating well; sakkàraü : undue adoration and offers of gifts; na abhinandeyya : should not entertain; vivekaü : tranquility; anubråhaye : should be pursued There is one way to worldly and material progress and profit.

Ràdha was a poor bràhmin who stayed in the monas- tery doing small services for the monks. For his services he was provided with food and clothing and other needs, but was not encouraged to join the Sangha, although he had a strong desire to become a monk. One day, early in the morning, when the Buddha sur- veyed the world with his supernormal power, he saw the poor bràhmin in his vision and knew that he was due for arahat- ship. So the Buddha went to the old man, and learned from him that the monks of the monastery did not want him to join the Sangha. The Buddha therefore called all the monks to him and asked them, “Is there any monk here who recollects any good turn done to him by this old man?” To this question, Venerable Sàriputta replied, “Venerable, I do recollect an instance when this old man offered me a spoonful of rice.” “If that be so,” the Buddha said, “shouldn’t you help your bene- factor to get liberated from the ills of life?” Then Venerable Sàriputta agreed to make the old man a monk and he was duly admitted to the Sangha.

Telling a person about what is likely to ensue, if one did either this or that, in the future, is referred to as “ anusàsanà ” (warning). ‘Reproach’ ( ovàda ) is made when one is physically present before the reproacher. But, if the two persons are not physically present together, and one’s com- munications are conveyed to the other, that is described as ‘warning’ ( anusàsanà ).

A person without these two salient qualities cannot be called a man of morals. Verbal and physical acts not tinged with love and compassion cannot be regarded as good and wholesome. Surely, one cannot kill, steal and so forth with thoughts of love and a good conscience, but it can be done only when one is driven by thoughts of cruelty, greed and ignorance. It is necessary to cultivate a certain measure of mental disci- pline, because the untamed mind always fi nds excuses to commit evil in word or deed. ‘When the thought is unguarded, bodily action also is unguarded; so are speech and mental action’. Conduct builds character. No one can bestow the gift of a good character on another. Each one has to build it up by thought, refl ec- tion, care, effort, mindfulness and introspection. Just as in the mastery of an art one has to labour hard, so to master the art of noble conduct on which a good and strong character depends, one must be diligent and on the alert. In the training of character the fi rst thing necessary is to prac- tice self control. If, instead, a man gives himself up to sense pleasures, his good social conduct and character will fall away – on this all teachers of religion and psychology agree. Those who are intoxicated with pleasures and are driven by the urge to enjoy themselves, cannot be properly educated until they have learned to admit their faults. Regarding high moral conduct the Buddha advised thus: “Evil can be abandoned. If it were not possible to give up evil, I would not say so. Since it can be done, I say unto you: ‘Give up evil.’” The Buddha continues, “Good can be cultivated. If it were not possible to cultivate good, I would not say so. Since it can be done, I say unto you: ‘Cultivate the good.’” This is the kind of guidance that a good advisor should provide to make a person abstain from unacceptable, immoral and anti-social ( asabbhà ) behaviour."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"78.

Bhaddiya was one of the monks staying at the Jetavana Monastery. Because of his short stature he was known as Lakunñaka (the dwarf) to other monks. Lakunñaka Bhaddiya was very good natured; even young monks would often tease him by pulling his nose or his ear, or by patting him on his head. Very often they would jokingly say, “Uncle, how are you? Are you happy or are you bored with your life here as a monk?” Lakunñaka Bhaddiya never retaliated in anger, or abused them; in fact, even in his heart he did not get angry with them. When told about the patience of Lakunñaka Bhaddiya, the Buddha said, “An arahat never loses his temper, he has no desire to speak harshly or to think ill of others. He is like a mountain of solid rock; as a solid rock is unshaken, so also, an arahat is unperturbed by scorn or by praise.” Explanatory Translation (Verse 81) yathà ekaghano selo vàtena na samãrati evaü paõóità nindà pasaüsàsu yathà : just like; ekaghano : a solid; selo : rock; vàtena : by the wind; na samãrati : is not shaken; evaü : in the same way; paõóità : the wise ones; nindà pasaüsàsu : both in praise and blame; na sami¤janti : remain unmoved"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"373 The wise remain unmoved and unruffl ed both by praise and humiliation.

His short stat- ure, from which the name Lakunñaka came, was the result of a past kamma. Arahat Lakunñaka Bhaddiya’s voice was deeply prized. In the Bhaddiya Sutta, the Buddha praised him saying that he, though hump- backed and unsightly, was highly gifted and his character was most lofty. Buddha declared that Lakunñaka Bhaddiya was pre-eminent in the Sangha, for his voice.

Kànamàtà was a devoted lay disciple of the Buddha. Her daughter Kàna was married to a man from another vil- lage. As Kàna had been on a visit to her mother for some time, her husband sent a message for her to come home. Her mother told her to wait for one more day as she wanted her to take some sweetmeats for her husband. The next day, Kànamàtà made some sweet-meats, but when four monks stood at her door for alms she offered some to them. The four monks told other monks about the sweetmeats from Kànamàtà’s house and they also came to stand at her door. Kànamàtà, as a devo- tee of the Buddha and his disciples, offered her sweetmeats to the monks as they came in, one after another.

The Buddha heard about Kàna and went to the house of Kànamàtà; there she offered him some rice gruel. After the meal, the Buddha sent for Kàna and asked her, “Did my monks take what was given them or what was not given them?” Kàna answered that the monks had taken only what was given them, and then added, “They were not in the wrong; only I was in the wrong.” Thus, she owned up her fault and she also paid homage to the Buddha. The Buddha then gave a discourse. At the end of the discourse, Kàna attained sotàpatti fruition. On the way back to the monastery, the Buddha met King Pasãnadi of Kosala. On being told about Kàna and her bitter attitude towards the monks, King Pasenadi asked the Buddha whether he had been able to teach her the dhamma and make her see the truth (dhamma). The Buddha replied, “Yes, I have taught her the dhamma, and I have also made her rich in her next existence.” Then the king promised the Buddha that he would make Kàna rich even in this existence.

At the request of a Bràhmin from Vera¤jà, the Buddha was, on one occasions, staying at Vera¤jà with a group of monks. While they were at Vera¤jà, the bràhmin failed to look after them. The people of Vera¤jà, who were then facing a famine, could offer very little to the monks when they went on their alms-round. In spite of all these hardships, the monks were not disheartened; they were quite contented with the small amount of shrivelled grain which the horse-traders offered them daily. At the end of the vassa (rainy season), after informing the bràh- min from Vera¤jà, the Buddha returned to the Jetavana Monas- tery, accompanied by the monks. The people of Sàvatthi wel- comed them back with choice food of all kinds. A group of people living with the monks, eating what- ever was left over by the monks, ate greedily like true glut- tons and went to sleep after their meals. On waking up, they were shouting, singing and dancing, thus making themselves a great nuisance. When the Buddha came in the evening to the congregation of monks, they reported to him about the behaviour of those unruly persons, and said, “These people living on the left-overs were quite decent and well-behaved when all of us were facing hardship and famine in Vera¤jà.

When the child was born, he again requested his wife to let him go; again, she pleaded with him to wait until the child could walk. Then Dhammika thought to himself, “It will be useless for me to ask my wife for her approval to join the Sangha; I shall work for my own liberation.” Having made a fi rm decision, he left his house to become a monk. He took a meditation topic from the Buddha and practiced meditation ardently and diligently and soon became an arahat.

The wife then thought, “Now that both my husband and my son have left the house, I had better leave it, too.” With this thought she left the house and became a nun; eventually, she too attained arahatship. At the congregation of the monks, the Buddha was told how Dhammika became a monk and attained arahatship, and how through him his son and his wife also attained arahatship. To them the Buddha said, “Monks, a wise man does not wish for wealth and prosperity by doing evil, whether it is for his own sake or for the sake of others.

Sometimes they were held in contempt, although there were solitary cases of their showing erudition in matters of philosophy, and so on. In his magnanimity, the Buddha treated women with consideration and civility, and pointed out to them, too, the path to peace, purity and sanctity. The Buddha established the order of nuns ( Bhikkhunã Sàsana ) for the fi rst time in history; for never before this had there been an order where women could lead a celibate life of renunciation. Women from all walks of life joined the order. The lives of quite a number of these noble nuns, their strenuous endeavours to win the goal of freedom, and their paeans of joy at deliverance of mind are graphically described in the ‘Psalms of the Sisters’ ( Therãgàthà ). While journeying from village to village, from town to town, instructing, enlightening and gladdening the many, the Buddha saw how superstitious folk, steeped in ignorance, slaughtered animals in worship of their gods. He spoke to them: Of life, which all can take but none can give, Life which all creatures love and strive to keep, Wonderful, dear and pleasant unto each, Even to the meanest... The Buddha never encouraged wrangling and animosity. Addressing the monks he once said: “I quarrel not with the world, monks, it is the world that quarrels with me. An exponent of the Dhamma quarrels not with anyone in the world.” To the Buddha the practice of the Dhamma is of great impor- tance.

As the Buddha has pointed out in many a sermon this is the only path which leads to the summit of the good life, which goes from lower to higher levels of the mental realm. It is a gradual training, a training in speech, deed and thought which brings about true wisdom culminat- ing in full enlightenment and the realization of Nibbàna. It is a path for all, irrespective of race, class or creed, a path to be cultivated every moment of our waking life. The one and only aim of the Buddha in pointing out this Teach- ing is stated in these words: “Enlightened is the Buddha, He teaches the Dhamma for enlightenment; tamed is the Buddha, He teaches the Dhamma for taming; calmed is the Buddha, He teaches the Dhamma for calming; crossed over has the Buddha, He teaches the Dhamma for crossing over; attained to Nibbàna has the Buddha, He teaches the Dhamma for attainment of Nibbàna .” This being the purpose for which the Buddha teaches the Dhamma, it is obvious that the aim of the listener or the follower of that path should also be the same, and not anything else. The aim, for instance, of a merciful and understanding physician should be to cure the patients that come to him for treatment, and the patient’s one and only aim, as we know, is to get himself cured as quickly as possible. That is the only aim of a sick person. We should also understand that though there is guidance, warn- ing and instruction, the actual practice of the Dhamma, the treading of the path, is left to us. We should proceed with undiminished vigour surmounting all obstacles and watching our steps along the right Path – the very path trodden and pointed out by the Buddhas of all ages. To explain the idea of crossing over, the Buddha used the simile of a raft: “Using the simile of a raft, monks, I teach the Dhamma designed for crossing over and not for retaining.” The Buddha, the compassionate Teacher, is no more, but he has left a legacy, the sublime Dhamma. The Dhamma is not an inven-"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"392 tion, but a discovery. It is an eternal law; it is everywhere with each man and woman, Buddhist or non-Buddhist, Eastern or Western. The Dhamma has no labels, it knows no limit of time, space or race. It is for all time. Each person who lives the Dhamma sees its light, sees and experiences it himself. It cannot be communicated to another, for it has to be self-realized. Kamma : action, correctly speaking denotes the wholesome and unwholesome volitions and their concomitant mental factors, caus- ing rebirth and shaping the destiny of beings. These karmical voli- tions become manifest as wholesome or unwholesome actions by body, speech and mind. Thus the Buddhist term kamma by no means signifi es the result of actions, and quite certainly not the fate of man, or perhaps even of whole nations (the so-called wholesale or mass- karma), which misconceptions have become widely spread in some parts of the world. Said the Buddha, “Volition, O Monks, is what I call action, for through volition one performs the action by body, speech or mind. There is Kamma , O Monks, that ripens in hell. Kamma that ripens in the animal world. Kamma that ripens in the world of men. Kamma that ripens in the heavenly world. Three-fold, however, is the fruit of kamma : ripening during the life-time, ripening in the next birth, ripening in later births. The three conditions or roots of unwholesome kamma (actions) are: Greed, Hatred, Delusion; those of wholesome kamma are: Unself- ishness, Hatelessness (goodwill), Non-delusion. “Greed is a condition for the arising of kamma , Hatred is a condi- tion for the arising of kamma , Delusion is a condition for the arising of kamma ”. “The unwholesome actions are of three kinds, conditioned by greed, or hate, or delusion.” “Killing, stealing, unlawful sexual intercourse, lying, slandering, rude speech, foolish babble, if practiced, carried on, and frequently cul- tivated, lead to rebirth in hell, or amongst the animals, or amongst the"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"393 ghosts.” “He who kills and is cruel goes either to hell or, if reborn as man, will be short-lived. He who torments others will be affl icted with disease. The angry one will look ugly, the envious one will be without infl uence, the stingy one will be poor, the stubborn one will be of low descent, the indolent one will be without knowledge. In the contrary case, man will be reborn in heaven or reborn as man, he will be long- lived, possessed of beauty, infl uence, noble descent and knowledge.” “Owners of their kamma are the beings, heirs of their kamma . The kamma is the womb from which they are born, their kamma is their friend, their refuge. Whatever kamma they perform, good or bad, thereof they will be the heirs.” Kilesa : defi lements – mind-defi ling, unwholesome qualities. “There are ten defi lements, thus called because they are themselves defi led, and because they defi le the mental factors associated with them. They are: (1) greed; (2) hate; (3) delusion; (4) conceit; (5) speculative views; (6) skeptical doubt; (7) mental torpor; (8) restlessness; (9) shameless- ness; (10) lack of moral dread or unconsciousness. Vipàka : karma-result – is any karmically (morally) neutral men- tal phenomenon (e.g., bodily agreeable or painful feeling, sense- consciousness etc.), which is the result of wholesome or unwholesome volitional action through body, speech or mind, done either in this or some previous life. Totally wrong is the belief that, according to Buddhism, everything is the result of previous action. Never, for exam- ple, is any karmically wholesome or unwholesome volitional action ( kamma ), the result of former action, being in reality itself kamma .

Fifty monks who had passed the rainy season in the kingdom of Kosala came to Jetavana at the close of the rainy season for the purpose of seeing the Buddha; and having paid obeisance to the Buddha, sat down respectfully on one side.

This is a summing up of the total process of refi ning the mind, so that it will be a fi t instrument to explore deathlessness. Of the defi lements that blemish the mind, the foremost are the fi ve-fold hindrances. Nãvarana : to hinder. In this context, what is meant is preventing behav- iour that is not conducive to the attainment of spiritual heights. Those factors that hinder or obstruct one’s progress along the path to liberation and higher states are described as nãvarana . There are fi ve kinds of these hindrances. They are: (1) sensual desires, (2) ill-will, (3) sloth and torpor, (4) restlessness and worry, and (5) doubts. (1) Sensual desires or attachment to pleasurable sense-objects such as form, sound, odour, taste, and contact. This is regarded as one of the Fetters, too, that bind one to saüsàra. An average person is bound to be tempted by alluring objects of sense. Lack of self-control results in the inevitable arising of passions. This hindrance is inhibited by one-pointedness, which is one of the fi ve charac- teristics of jhànas . It is attenuated on attaining sakadàgàmi and is completely eradicated on attaining anàgàmi . Subtle forms of attachment such as råpa ràga and aråpa ràga (attachment to realms of form and formless realms) are eradicated only on attaining arahatship. The following six conditions tend to the eradication of sense-desires. (i) perceiving the loathsomeness of the object, (ii) constant meditation on loathsomeness, (iii) sense-restraint, (iv) moderation in food, (v) good friend- ship, and (vi) profi table talk. (2) ill-will or aversion. A desirable object leads to attachment, while an undesirable one leads to aversion. These are the two great fi res that burn the whole world.

(i) perceiving the object with thoughts of goodwill, (ii) constant medita- tion on loving-kindness ( mettà ), (iii) thinking that kamma is one’s own, (iv) adherence to that view, (v) good friendship, and (vi) profi table talk. (3) Sloth is explained as a morbid state of the mind, and Middha as a morbid state of the mental states. A stolid mind is as ‘inert as a bat hang- ing to a tree, or as molasses cleaving to a stick, or as a lump of butter too stiff for spreading’. Sloth and torpor should not be understood as bodily drowsiness, because arahats, who have destroyed these two states, also experience bodily fatigue. These two promote mental inertness and are opposed to strenuous effort. They are inhibited by the jhàna factor and are eradicated on attaining arahatship. The following six conditions tend to the eradication of Sloth and Torpor: (i) refl ection on the object of moderation in food, (ii) changing of bodily postures, (iii) contemplation on the object of light; (iv) living in the open, (v) good friendship and (vi) profi table talk. (4) Mental restlessness or excitement of the mind. It is a mental state associated with all types of immoral consciousness. As a rule an evil is done with some excitement or restlessness. Worry is either repentance over the committed evil or over the unfulfi lled good. Repentance over one’s evil does not exempt one from its inevitable consequences. The best repentance is the will not to repeat that evil. Both these hindrances are inhibited by the jhàna factor, sukha or happiness. Restlessness is eradicated on attaining Arahatship, and worry is eradicated on attaining anàgàmi . The following six conditions tend to the eradication of these two states: (i) erudition or learning, (ii) questioning or discussion, (iii) understanding the nature of the vinaya discipline, (iv) asso- ciation with senior monks, (v) good friendship and (vi) profi table talk. 5) Doubt or indecision. That which is devoid of the remedy of wis- dom. It is also explained as vexation due to perplexed thinking. Here it is not used in the sense of doubt with regard to the Buddha etc., for even non-Buddhists inhibit vicikicchà and gain jhànas . As a fetter vicikicchà is that doubt about Buddha etc., but as a hindrance it denotes unsteadiness in one particular thing that is being done. The commentarial explanation of vicikicchà is the inability to decide anything defi nitely that it is so. In other words it is indecision. This state is inhibited by the jhàna factor – vicàra , sustained applica- tion. It is eradicated on attaining sotàpatti ."},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"401 The following six conditions tend to its eradication: (i) knowledge of the Dhamma and vinaya, (ii) discussion or questioning, (iii) understand- ing of the nature of the vinaya discipline, (iv) excessive confi dence, (v) good friendship, and (vi) profi table talk. [Another comment on Nibbàna obsta- cles to the mind, that blind our mental vision.] In the presence of them we cannot reach neighbourhood-concentration and full concentration, and are unable to discern clearly the truth. They are: sensuous desire, ill-will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and scruples, and skeptical doubt. In the similes, sensuous desire is compared with water mixed with manifold colours, ill-will with boiling water, sloth and torpor with water covered by mosses, restlessness and scruples with agitated water whipped by the wind, skeptical doubt with turbid and muddy water. Just as in such water one cannot perceive one’s own refl exion, so in the presence of these fi ve mental Hindrances, one cannot clearly discern one’s own benefi t, nor that of others, nor that of both. Regarding the temporary suspension of the fi ve hin- drances on entering the fi rst absorption, the Sutta text runs as follows: “He has cast away sensuous desire; he dwells with a heart free from sensuous desire; from desire he cleanses his heart. “He has cast away Ill-will; he dwells with a heart free from ill- will, cherishing love and compassion toward all living beings, he cleanses his heart from ill-will. “He has cast away sloth and torpor; he dwells free from sloth and torpor; loving the light, with watchful mind, with clear consciousness, he cleanses his mind from sloth and torpor. “He has cast away restlessness and scruples; dwelling with mind undisturbed, with heart full of peace, he cleanses his mind from restlessness and scruples. “He has cast away skeptical doubt; dwelling free from doubt, full of confi dence in the good, he cleanses his heart from doubt. “He has put aside these fi ve hindrances, and come to know these paralysing defi lements of the mind. And far from sensual impressions, far from unwholesome things, he enters into the fi rst absorption etc.” The overcoming of these fi ve hindrances by the absorptions is, as already pointed out, a merely temporary suspension, called ‘overcoming through repression’.

These are seven fac- tors that are conducive to enlightenment. They are described as bhojja¤ga . The truth-seekers attitude towards these seven factors of enlightenment is given below: The truth-seeker knows well – ‘I have the enlightenment factor of mindfulness’, or when it is not present – he knows well that is absent; he knows well how the arising of the non-arisen enlightenment factor of mindfulness comes to be and how the fulfi llment by meditation of the arisen enlightenment factor of mindfulness comes to be. When the enlightenment factor of ‘investigation of reality’ ( dhaümavicaya ) is present he knows well – ‘I have the enlightenment factor of investigation of reality’; when it is not present he knows well that it is absent; he knows well how the arising of the enlightenment factor of investigation of reality comes to be and how the fulfi llment by meditation of the arisen enlightenment fac- tor of investigation of reality comes to be. When the enlightenment factor of Energy ( viriya ) is present he knows well – ‘I have the enlightenment factor of energy’, or when it is not present, he knows well that it is absent; he knows well how the arising of the non-arisen enlightenment factor of energy comes to be. When the enlightenment factor of joy ( pãti ) is present he knows well – ‘I have the enlightenment factor of joy’ or when it is not present he knows well that it is absent; he knows well how the rising of the non-arising enlightenment factor of joy comes to be, and how the fulfi llment by meditation of the arisen enlightenment factor of joy comes to be. When the enlightenment factor of tranquility ( passaddhi ) is present he knows well – ‘I have the enlightenment factor of tranquility or when it is not present he knows well that it is absent; he knows well how the aris- ing of the non-arisen enlightenment factor of tranquility comes to be, and how the fulfi llment by meditation of the arisen enlightenment factor of tranquility comes to be. When the enlightenment factor of concentration ( samàdhi ) is present he knows well – ‘I have the enlightenment factor of concentration,’ or when it is not present he knows well that it is absent, he knows well how the aris- ing of the non-arisen enlightenment factor of concentration comes to be, and how the fulfi llment by meditation of the arisen enlightenment factor of concentration comes to be."},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"403 When the enlightenment factor of equanimity ( upekkhà ) is present he knows well – ‘I have the enlightenment factor of equanimity’, or when it is not present he knows well that it is absent; he knows well how the arising of the non-arisen enlightenment factor of equanimity comes to be, and how the fulfi llment by meditation of the arisen enlightenment factor of equanimity comes to be. Thus the truth-seeker lives contemplating the Dhammas, clinging to nothing in this world. Thus a disciple lives contemplating the dhammas with respect to the seven factors of enlightenment. Bojjha¤ga : ‘the seven factors of enlightenment’, are: mindfulness, investigation of the law, energy, rapture, tranquility, concentration, equa- nimity. “Because they lead to enlightenment therefore they are called fac- tors of enlightenment”. The seven factors are said to be the means of attaining the threefold wisdom. They may be attained by means of the four foundations of mind- fulness. The Buddha said: (1) “Whenever, O monks, the monk dwells contemplating the body ( kàya ), feeling ( vedanà ), mind ( citta ) and mind-objects ( dhamma ), strenuous, clearly-conscious, mindful, after subduing worldly greed and grief, at such a time his mindfulness is present and undisturbed; and whenever his mindfulness is present and undisturbed, at such a time he has gained and is developing the Factor of Enlightenment ‘Mindfulness’ ( sati-sambojjha¤ga ), and thus this factor of enlightenment reaches fullest perfection. (2) “Whenever, while dwelling with mindfulness, he wisely inves- tigates, examines and thinks over the law at such a time he has gained and is developing the factor of enlightenment ‘Investigation of the Law’ ( dhaüma-vicaya ). (3) “Whenever, while wisely investigating his energy is fi rm and unshaken at such a time he has gained and is developing the Factor of Enlightenment’ Energy’ ( viriya ). (4) “Whenever in him, while fi rm in energy, arises supersensu- ous rapture at such a time he has gained and is developing the factor of enlightenment ecstasy ( pãti ). (5) “Whenever, while enraptured in mind, his body and his mind become composed at such a time he has gained and is developing the Factor of Enlightenment tranquility ( passaddhi )."},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"404 (6) “Whenever, while being composed in his body and happy, his mind becomes concentrated at such a time he has gained and is developing the Factor of Enlightenment Concentration ( samàdhi ).

This expression is associated exclu- sively with the demise of the Buddha in Buddhist literature, although it can be used in the instance of any Arahat. It also refers to the attainment of full enlightenment. The Parinibbàna of the Buddha is described in detail in Buddhist Scripture. The following is a brief description of the Buddha’s last moment. The Buddha attained to the fi rst ecstasy ( jhàna ). Emerging from it, He attained in order to the second, third, and fourth ecstasies. Emerging from the fourth ecstasy, He attained to “The realm of the infi n- ity of space” ( àkàsàna¤càyatana ). Emerging from it He attained to ‘the realm of the infi nity of consciousness’ ( vi¤¤àna¤càyatana ). Emerging from it, He attained to the realm of nothingness’ ( àki¤ca¤¤àyatana ).

Emerging from it, He attained to ‘the cessation of perceptions and sensations’ ( Sa¤¤àvedayita-Nirodha ). Then the Buddha, emerging from ‘the cessation of perceptions and sensations’, attained to ‘the realm of neither perception nor non-perception.’ Emerging from it, He attained to ‘the realm of nothingness.’ Emerging from it, He attained to ‘the realm of the infi nity of consciousness.’ Emerging from it, He attained to ‘the realm of the infi nity of space.’ Emerging from it, He attained to the fourth ecstasy. Emerging from it, He attained to the third ecstasy. Emerging from it, He attained to the second ecstasy. Emerging from it, He attained to the third ecstasy. Emerging from it, He attained to the fourth ecstasy.

Now on a certain occasion Devadatta joined forces with Ajàtasattu, climbed Vulture Peak, and out of the wickedness of his heart, saying to himself, “I will kill the Buddha,” hurled down a rock. Two mountain crags caught the rock and splin- tered it; but one of the fl ying pieces struck the foot of the Buddha and caused blood to fl ow. The Buddha suffered intense pains and was removed by the monks to Maddakucchi. Desir- ing to go on to Jãvaka’s Mango-grove, the Buddha said to the monks, “Carry me thither.” So the monks took the Buddha and carried him to Jivaka’s Mango-grove. When Jãvaka heard the news, he immediately went to the Buddha and to heal the wound applied an ointment. Then he bound up the wound and said to the Buddha, “Venerable, I have a patient in the city. As soon as I have visited him, I will return. Let this dressing remain exactly as it is until I return.” So saying, Jãvaka went and treated his patient. But the gate was closed when he returned, and he was therefore unable to enter. Thereupon the following thought occurred to him, “I have committed a griev- ous fault. I applied an astringent to the foot of the Buddha and bound up his wound, just as I should have bound up the wound of any other man. It is now time to remove the bandage.

On a certain occasion, after keeping residence during the season of the rains at Ràjagaha, the Buddha made this announcement to the monks, “At the end of a fortnight I will go forth on a pilgrimage for alms.” But while the monks were scalding their bowls and dyeing their robes, the Venerable Mahàkassapa washed his robes. The monks were offended at this and said, ‘Why does the Venerable wash his robes? Within and without this city dwell a hundred and eighty million people. So many of these as are not the Venerable’s kinsfolk are his supporters; and so many as are not his supporters are his kinsfolk. All these people show honour and reverence to the Venerable by providing him with the four requisites. If he rejects all their good offi ces, where will he go? Even were he to go, he would not go farther than Màpamàda Cave.” (Màpamàda Cave, by the way, acquired its name in the fol- lowing way: Whenever the Buddha reached this cave, he would say to the monks who were to return, “Now you may return; be not heedless – mà pamajjittha .” Thus this cave came to be called Màpamàda Cave.)

The monks were offended at this and said, “Did you observe, brethren? Did we not just say, ‘Why is Mahàkassapa washing his robes? He will not accompany the Buddha.’ Eve- rything has happened just as we said it would.” When the Buddha heard the talk of the monks, he turned around, stood still, and said, “Monks, what is this you are saying?’ “We are talking about Venerable Mahàkassapa, Venerable,” replied the monks, and then repeated their conversation word for word. The Buddha listened to what they had to say and then replied, “Monks, you say, ‘Mahàkassapa is attached to his households and his requisites.’ As a matter of fact, he turned back because it was his desire to obey my command. For in a previous state of existence he made an earnest wish and became, like the moon, free from attachment.

When he had collected enough food he returned to the monastery, dried up the rice and hoarded it. Thus, there was no need for him to go on an alms-round every day; he then remained in jhàna (one-pointed) concentration for two or three days.

It is quite clear that they do not hoard worldly requisites and material things. They do not also accumulate fresh merit or sin. They do not accumulate new Kamma. Because of that they do not have a rebirth. An arahat may commit an act of virtue. He does not accumu- late new merit for that act. arahat : This stanza dwells on the special qualities of an arahat. Who, then, are the arahats? They are those who cultivate the path and reach the highest stage of realization ( arahatta ), the fi nal liberation from suffering. Victors like me are they, indeed, They who have won defi lements’ end."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"417 Arahats have given up all attachments, even the subtlest. Therefore, an arahat’s mind roams only on emptiness, objectlessness and total freedom of thought. The Buddha, however, also made clear to his disciples the dif- ference between himself and the arahats who were his disciples. They were declared by the Buddha to be his equals as far as the emancipa- tion from defi lements and ultimate deliverance are concerned: ‘The Buddha, O disciples, is an Arahat, a fully Enlightened One. It is He who proclaims a path not proclaimed before, He is the knower of a path, who understands a path, who is skilled in a path. And now His disciples are way-farers who follow in His footsteps. That is the distinction, the specifi c feature which distinguishes the Buddha, who is an Arahat; a Fully Enlightened One, from the disciple who is freed by insight.’ Sanskrit arhat ‘the Consummate One’, ‘The Worthy One’: are titles applied exclusively to the Buddha and the perfected disciples. As the books reveal, the fi rst application of the term to the Buddha was by himself. That was when the Buddha was journeying from Gayà to Bàrànasi to deliver his fi rst sermon to the fi ve ascetics. On the way, not far from Gayà, the Buddha was met by Upaka, an ascetic, who, struck by the serene appearance of the Master, inquired: ‘Who is thy teacher? Whose teaching do you profess?’ Replying in verse, the Buddha said: ‘I, verily, am the Arahat in the world, A teacher peerless am I...’ He used the word for the second time when addressing the fi ve ascet- ics thus: ‘I am an Arahat, a Tathàgata, fully enlightened.’ The word is applied only to those who have fully destroyed the taints. In this sense, the Buddha was the fi rst Arahat in the world as he himself revealed to Upaka."},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"93.

One day, the Venerable, whose robes were worn out, was seeking material on refuse-heaps and in other similar places. Now in the Venerable’s third previous existence he had a wife who had been reborn in the World of the Thirty- three as the goddess Jàlinã. When the goddess saw the Vener- able seeking cloths for robes, she resolved to aid him. So tak- ing three celestial cloths thirteen cubits long and four cubits wide, and thinking to herself, “If I display these cloths in this manner, the Venerable will not take them,” she went to a cer- tain refuse-heap in front of the heap where the Venerable was seeking cloths and laid them down in such a way that only the hems were visible. Taking the cloths with him, he went his way. On the day he was to make his robes, the Buddha, accompanied by his retinue of many monks, went to the monastery and sat down; likewise the eighty chief Venerables sat down there also. For the purpose of sewing the robes, Venerable Kassapa the Great sat at the foot, Venerable Sàriputta in the midst, and Venerable ânanda at the head. The company of monks spun out the thread, the Buddha threaded the needle, and Venerable Mog- gallàna went hither and thither supplying whatever else might be needed.

Sakka drew a circle about the place where they were making the robes; the earth was as if dyed with lac; there was a great heap of food both soft and hard remaining over and above to the monks who had eaten. The monks were offended, and said, “Why should such a quantity of food be provided for so few monks?” When they told The Buddha, he said, “But, monks, you do not think that this was brought by any orders of Anuruddha, do you?” “Yes, Venerable; we do.” “Monks, my son Anuruddha does not talk thus. They that have rid themselves of the corruptions do not spend their time talking about requisites; nay, these provisions were produced by the supernatural power of a goddess.” Explanatory Translation (Verse 93) yassa àsavà parikkhãõà àhàre ca anissito yassa su¤¤ato animitto ca vimokkho gocaro tassa padaü àkàse sakuntànaü iva durannayaü yassa : whose; àsavà : taints; parikkhãõà : exhausted (gone); àhàre ca : even in food; anissito : not attached; yassa : to whom; su¤¤ato : emptiness; animitto ca : and objectlessness; vimokkho gocaro : liberation are their field; tassa padaü : their path; àkàse : in the sky; sakuntànaü iva : like those of birds; durannayaü : cannot be seen"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"421 If one is totally rid of infl uences, internal or external, that motivate human behaviour, and is not attached even to food, that kind of individual focusses his mind on emptiness, objectlessness and freedom of thought. The path of such saints is diffi cult to be traced, like the path of birds fl ying through the sky. Commentary àsavà : Usually translated as cankers, fl uxes, fl uxions, taints, corrup- tions, intoxicants, biases. We translate this word (d + s ava = fl owing in) as infl uence that motivates behaviour. Four infl uences are listed in the Suttas: 1) tendency towards sensual desires ( kàmàsava ); 2) tendency towards existence ( bhavàsava ); 3) tendency towards beliefs ( diññhàsava ); and 4) tendency towards unawareness ( avijjàsava ). A list of three, omitting the tendency towards views is also found in the Suttas. The four-fold division also occurs under the name of ‘fl oods’ and ‘yokes’. Through the path of stream-entry, the infl uence of views is destroyed; through the path of non-returning, the infl uence of sense- desire; through the path of arahatship, the infl uence of existence and ignorance. Buddha shows how to overcome the infl uences namely through insight, sense-control, avoidance, wise use of the necessities of life. Khãnàsava , one whose infl uences are destroyed, or one who is infl uence-free, is a name for the arahat or Holy One. The state of arahat- ship is frequently called àsavakkhaya , ‘the destruction of the infl uences’. Suttas concluding with the attainment of arahatship by the listeners, often end with the words “During this utterance, the hearts of the monks were freed from the infl uences through clinging no more”. This term àsava could mean impulse, urge, compulsion, motive or infl uence. It is similar to the term tanhà commonly translated as craving. Tanh à is also of three kinds: thirst for sensual pleasure ( kàma tanhà ); thirst for existence ( bhava tanhà ); and thirst for non-existence ( vibhava tanhà )."},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"94.

For once upon a time, on the occasion of the terminal festival, the Buddha sat on the ground fl oor of the mansion of the Mother of Migàra, surrounded by a company of eminent lay disciples. At this time Venerable Kaccàyana resided in the Avanti country. Now this Venerable, although obliged to come from a great distance, regularly attended the preaching of the Dhamma. Therefore, when the Venerables sat down, they always left a seat for Venerable Kaccàyana. Sakka the king of gods drew near with his celestial reti- nue from the two Worlds of Gods, and honoured the Buddha with celestial perfumes and garlands. Not seeing Venerable Kaccàyana, he thought to himself, ‘Why is my noble Venerable nowhere seen? It would be well if he were to draw near.” At that very moment the Venerable drew near, and showed him- self sitting in his proper seat. When Sakka saw the Venerable, he grasped him fi rmly by the ankles and said, “It is indeed well that my noble Venerable has come; that my noble Vener- able should come, was the very thing I wished for.” So saying, he rubbed the Venerable’s feet with both hands, honoured him with perfumes and garlands, and having paid obeisance to him, stood respectfully on one side.

The Buddha is steady in four ways because he has ended his wanderings in saüsàra. These are the four ways in which he is steady on that account: (1) Bhagavà kàmogham tinno : The Buddha has crossed the fl ood of desires.

Due to these and many other reasons the Buddha is steady, stable ( tàdi ). A person’s stability is the emotional stability that comes from not reacting to what is seen, heard, smelt, tasted or touched.

Once upon a time, at the conclusion of the rains, Vener- able Sàriputta, desiring to go forth on an alms-pilgrimage, took leave of the Buddha, paid obeisance to him, and departed with his own retinue. Many other monks took leave of the Venerable. In dismissing the monks the Venera- ble mentioned the personal and family name of all of the monks who were known by personal and family names. A certain monk who was not known by a personal and family name said, “Oh, that the Venerable would greet me by a per- sonal and family name in dismissing me.” But in the great throng of monks the elder did not notice him. Thereupon the monk said to himself, “He does not greet me as he does the other monks,” and straightaway conceived a grudge against the Venerable. Besides that, the hem of the Venerable’s garment brushed against the monk, and this also served to intensify the hatred the monk felt towards the Venerable. So, as soon as he knew that the Venerable had passed beyond the entrance to the monastery, he approached the Buddha and said to him, “Ven- erable, Venerable Sàriputta, doubtless thinking to himself, ‘I am your chief disciple,’ struck me a blow that almost injured"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"428 my ear.

When the Buddha questioned him about the incident, the elder, instead of saying, “I did not strike that monk,” recited his own virtues. As the Venerable recited his own virtues, remorse per- vaded the whole body of the monk who had unjustly slan- dered him. And straightaway he fell at the feet of the Buddha, admitted that he was guilty of slander, and confessed his fault. The Buddha addressing the Venerable, said, “Sàriputta, pardon this deluded man, lest his head split into seven pieces.” Thereupon the Venerable crouched before the monk, and extending his clasped hands in an attitude of reverence, said to him, “Venerable, I freely pardon this venerable monk. Let this venerable monk also pardon me if I have in any way offended against him.” Thereupon the monks said, “Behold, brethren, the surpassing goodness of the Venerable! He cherishes neither anger nor hatred against this lying, slan- derous monk. Instead, he crouches before him, extends his hands in an attitude of reverence, and asks his pardon.” When the Buddha heard the talk of the monks, he said, “Monks, what are you talking about?” When they told him, he said, “Monks, it is impossible for Sàriputta and his like to cherish anger or hatred. Sàriputta’s mind is like the great earth, like a threshold, like a pool of still water.”"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"429 Explanatory Translation (Verse 95) subbato pañhavãsamo no virujjati indakhãlåpamo tàdi rahado iva apetakaddamo tàdino saüsàrà na bhavanti subbato : well conducted; pañhavãsamo like the earth; no viru- jjati : does not stand opposed to anyone; indakhãlåpamo : like a fortress tower; tàdi : stable; rahado iva : like the ocean; ape- takaddamo : devoid of mud; tàdino : stable one; saüsàrà : (for him) wandering in existence; na bhavanti : does not happen The noble Arahats never lose their temper whatsoever is done to them.

A certain youth of respectable family, residing at Kosambi, retired from the world and became a monk in the religion of the Buddha. After making his full profession, he was known as Venerable Kosambivàsã Tissa. After he had kept residence during the season of the rains at Kosambi, his supporter brought a set of three robes and offerings of ghee and palm sugar and laid them at his feet. “Venerable, if it be true that you have no novice to minister to your needs, my son will become your novice.” The Venerable graciously accepted the offer. The lay disciple brought his own son, but seven years old, to the Venerable, and committed him into the Venerable’s hands, saying, “Pray receive him into the Sangha, Venerable.” The Venerable moistened the boy’s hair, taught him how to meditate on the fi rst fi ve of the consistent parts of the body, and received him into the Sangha. The instant the razor touched his hair, he attained arahatship, together with the supernatural faculties. The Venerable, having received the youth into the Sangha, remained at Kosambi for a fortnight.

So assuming a cross-legged posture near the bed of his preceptor, the novice spent the night sit- ting up.

The novice, instead of saying, “Venerable, my eye has been blinded,” covered his eye with one hand and went out. More- over, when it was time for him to perform his duties as novice, he did not say, “My eye has been blinded,” nor did he remain seated, but covering his eye with one hand and taking a hand- broom in the other hand, he swept out the privy and the wash- room, after which, setting out water for washing the face, he swept out the Venerable’s cell. When he advanced to present the toothstick to the Ven- erable, the novice told him the whole story from the begin- ning. When the Venerable heard his story, he was deeply moved. The novice tried to comfort the Venerable but he would not be comforted. Overcome with remorse he took the novice to the Buddha. The Buddha asked him, “Monk, is eve- rything really well?” The Venerable replied, “All is well with me.

The Buddha, seeing that they possessed the requisite faculties for attaining arahatship, addressed Venerable Sàriputta as follows, “Sàriputta, do you believe that the quality of faith, when it has been developed and enlarged, is connected with the deathless and terminates in the deathless?” In this manner the Buddha questioned the Venerable with reference to the fi ve moral qualities.

Do you not believe in the virtues of the Buddhas and the rest?’ But as a matter of fact, Sàriputta walks not by the faith of others, for the reason that he has, in and by himself, attained states of mind to which the Paths and the Fruits lead, by the power of spiritual insight induced by ecstatic meditation.

Ariya-Puggala are those who have real- ized one of the eight stages of holiness, i.e., the four supermundane Paths ( magga ) and the four supermundane Fruitions ( phala ) of these paths. There are four pairs:– (1) the one realizing the path of stream- winning; (2) the one realizing the fruition of stream-winning; (3) the one realizing the path of once-return; (4) the one realizing the fruition of once-return; (5) the one realizing the path of non- return; (6) the one realizing the fruition of non-return; (7) the one realizing the path of holiness; (8) the one realizing the fruition of holiness. Summed up, there are four noble individuals: the stream- winner, the once-returner, the non-returner, the holy one. In some texts gotrabhå is listed as the ninth noble individual. According to the Abhi dhamma, supermundane path, or simply path ( magga ), is a designation of the moment of entering into one of the four stages of holiness – Nibbàna being the object – produced by intuitional insight into the impermanency, misery and impersonality of exist- ence, fl ashing forth and transforming one’s life and nature. By fruitions are meant those moments of consciousness, which fol- low immediately thereafter as the result of the path, and which in certain circumstances may repeat for innumerable times during life-time."},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"99.

We are told that a certain monk who lived by his alms-bowl, got a meditation topic from the Buddha and retired to a dilapidated pleasure garden for the purpose of meditation. Now a certain courtesan made an appointment with a man, saying, “I will go to such and such a place and you meet me there.” The woman kept the appointment, but the man did not. For some time she watched in vain the path by which she expected him to come. Finally, disappointed at his failure to keep his appointment, she strolled hither and thither and went into the pleasure gar- den. There she saw the monk sitting cross-legged. Looking this way and that, and seeing no one else about, she said to herself, “Here is a man; I will throw his thoughts into confusion.” So standing in front of the monk, she took down her undergar- ment several times and put it on again, unloosened her hair and bound it up again, and clapped her hands and laughed. The Venerable became excited; his whole body, in fact, was suf- fused with excitement. “What does this mean?” thought he. The Buddha considered within himself, “A monk obtained a meditation topic from me and went forth to per- form his meditations. How is he getting on?” Seeing that woman, and observing her evil conduct, and perceiving that her evil conduct was upsetting the Venerable, still remaining seated in his perfumed chamber he spoke as follows, “Monks, there is no delight where those abide who seek after their lusts.

Explanatory Translation (Verse 99) yattha jano na ramatã ramaõãyàni ara¤¤àni vãtaràgà ramissanti te kàmagavesino na yattha : those places; jano : the worldly masses; na ramatã : do not take delight in; ramaõãyàni ara¤¤àni : (such) attrac- tive forests; vãtaràgà : the passionless; ramissanti : take delight in; te : those places; kàmagavesino : pursuers of sensual pleasures; na : do not take delight in Those fascinating forests that do not capture the mind of the worldly masses and in which they do not take delight are attractive to the passionless ones. The Arahats take delight in the forests, because they are not pursuers of sensual pleasures. Commentary vitaràgo : the passionless one: the arahat. The arahat is essentially a pas- sionless one. An arahat, literally, a worthy one, is not subject to rebirth because he does not accumulate fresh Kammic activities. The seeds of his reproduction have all been destroyed. The arahat realizes that what was to be accomplished has been done, a heavy burden of sorrow has fi nally been relinquished, and all forms of craving and all shades of ignorance are totally annihilated. The happy pilgrim now stands on heights more than celestial, far removed from uncontrolled passions and the defi lements of the world, experiencing the unutterable bliss of Nibbàna. Rebirth can no longer affect him since no more reproductive seeds are formed by fresh kammic activities. An arahat is called an asekha , one who does not undergo training, as who has lived the holy life and has accomplished his object. The other saints from the sotàpatti stage to the arahat path stage are called sekhas because they still undergo training. Arahats could experience the Nibbànic bliss uninterruptedly for as long as they liked even in this life.

Tambadàñhika served the king as an executioner of thieves for fi fty-fi ve years. In old age he could no longer cut off a man’s head with a single blow. On the day he was retired from offi ce, he gave orders that sweet milk-porridge should be cooked for him. And taking with him old clothes and jas- mine fl owers and perfumes, he went to the river and bathed. Having so done, he put on the old clothes, decked himself with garlands, anointed his limbs, and went home and sat down. They set before him sweet milk-porridge made with fresh ghee and water for rinsing the hands. At that moment Venerable Sàriputta showed himself at the door of the former executioner’s house. When the man saw the Venerable, he paid obeisance to him. And escorting him into his house, he provided him with a seat, poured the sweet milk-porridge into his bowl, spread fresh ghee thereon, and standing beside him, began to fan him. After the meal, the monk taught him the Dhamma, but Tambadàñhika could not pay attention, because he was so agi- tated as he recollected his past life as an executioner.

Then the monk asked, “If that is so, would you be guilty or not?” Tambadàñhika then concluded that, as he was not responsible for the evil deeds, he was not guilty. He, therefore, calmed down, and requested the monk to continue his exposition. As he listened to the Dhamma w it h proper at te nt ion, he c a me ver y c lo s e to at t a i n i ng s ot àpat t i magga and reached as far as anuloma ¤àõa (adaption-to-truth- knowledge). After the discourse, Tambadàñhika accompanied Venerable Sàriputta for some distance and then returned home. On his way home a cow (actually a demon in the guise of a cow) gored him to death. When the Buddha came to the congregation of the monks in the evening, they informed him about the death of Tambadàñhika. When asked where Tambadàñhika was reborn, the Buddha told them that although Tambadàñhika had com- mitted evil deeds throughout his life, because he compre- hended the Dhamma after hearing it from Venerable Sàriputta and had already attained anuloma ¤àõa before he died, he was reborn in the Tusita deva world. The monks wondered how such an evil-doer could have such great benefi t after listening to the Dhamma just once. To them the Buddha said that the length of a discourse is of no consequence, for one single word of sense can produce much benefi t.

A group of merchants went out to sea in a boat; their boat was wrecked at sea and all, except one, died. The only survivor got hold of a plank and eventually came to land at the port of Suppàraka. As he was naked, he tied a piece of bark to his body, got hold of a bowl, and sat in a place where people could see him. Passers-by gave him rice and gruel; some thought that he was a holy man and paid respects to him.

I now realize that I have done a great wrong.

That was why the Buddha did not want to talk about the Dhamma immediately but wanted him to calm down to enable him to take in the Dhamma properly. Still, Bàhiya persistently pleaded. So, while standing on the road, the Buddha said to Bàhiya, “Bàhiya, when you see an object, be conscious of just the visible object; when you hear a sound, be conscious of just the sound; when you smell or taste or touch something, be conscious of just the smell, the taste or the touch; and when you think of anything, be conscious of just the mind-object.” After hearing the above discourse, Bàhiya attained ara- hatship and he asked permission from the Buddha to join the Sangha. The Buddha told him to get the robes, the bowl and other requisites of a monk. On his way to get them, he was gored to death by a cow which was, in fact, a female evil spirit in the likeness of a cow.

A rich merchant of Ràjagaha had an only daughter who was about sixteen years of age, and she was exceedingly beau- tiful and fair to see. Her mother and father lodged her on the topmost fl oor of a seven-storied palace in an apartment of royal splendour, and gave her only a single slave-woman to wait upon her. Now one day a young man of station was caught in the act of robbery. They bound his hands behind his back and led him to the place of execution, scourging him with lashes at every cross-road. The merchant’s daughter heard the shouts of the crowd, said to herself, “What is that?” looked down from the top of the palace, and saw him. Straightaway she fell in love with him. So great, in fact, was her longing for him that she took to her bed and refused to eat. Her mother asked her, “What does this mean, my dear daughter?” If I can have that young man who was caught in the act of committing robbery and who was led through the streets, life will be worth living; if not, life is not worth living; I shall die here and now.” The mother, unable to pacify her daughter, told the father; but the father likewise was unable to pacify his daughter. “What is to be done?” thought he.

She resolved to win favour of her husband; and from that time on, adorned with all her adornments, she prepared her husband’s meals with her own hand. After a few days the robber thought to himself, “When can I kill this woman, take her jewels and sell them, and so be able to take my meals in a certain tavern? This is the way!” He took to his bed and refused to eat. She came to him and asked, “Are you in pain?” “Not at all, wife.” “Then perhaps my mother and father are angry with you?” “They are not angry with me, wife.” “What is the matter, then?” “Wife, that day when I was bound and led through the streets, I saved my life by vowing and offer- ing to the deity that lives on Robbers’ Cliff; likewise it was through his supernatural power that I gained you for my wife. I was wondering how I could fulfi ll my vow of an offering to the deity.” “Husband, do not worry; I will see to the offering; tell me what is needed.” “Rich rice-porridge, fl avoured with honey; and the fi ve kinds of fl owers, including the làjà fl ower.” “Very well, husband, I will make ready the offering.” Having prepared the whole offering, she said to her husband, “Come, husband, let us go”. “Very well, wife; let your kinsmen remain behind; put on your costly garments and adorn yourself with your precious jewels, and we will go gaily, laughing and enjoying ourselves.” She did as she was told.

Take these jewels and spare my life.” She thought to herself, “Oh, what a wicked deed is this! However, wisdom was not made to be cooked and eaten, but rather to make men look before they leap. I shall fi nd a way of dealing with him.” And she said to him, “Husband, when they caught you in the act of committing robbery and led you through the streets, I told my mother and father, and they spent a thousand pieces of money in ransoming you, and they gave you a place in their house, and from that time on I have been your benefactress; today do me the favour of letting me pay obeisance to you.” “Very well, wife,” said he, granted her the favour of paying obeisance to him, and then took his stand near the edge of the cliff. She walked around him three times, keeping him on her right hand, and paid obeisance to him in the four places. Then she said to him, “Husband, this is the last time I shall see you. Henceforth you will see me no more, neither shall I see you any more.” And she embraced him both before and behind.

Commentary “ They are known by such names as Hà-hà , hå , citraratha , hansa , vishvàvasu , gomàya , tumburu and Nandi .” In the ancient text ‘ Va h ni Puràna ’, ( T h e A d o r a - tion of Fire) they are divided into eleven groups. All these gandhabbas are divided into two main groups: (1) màtarva gàndharva (those who are born in that state due to past merit in this age); (2) deva gàndharva (those born in that state due to merit in previous ages). attadantassa posassa : to the person who has conquered his own self. In Buddhist thought atta (soul or self) is mentioned at times for the conven- tional purpose of identifying a person. But, the concept of no soul or self- lessness ( anatta ) is a central principle of Buddhist thought. The following is a detailed commentary on this concept: apart from mind and matter, which constitute this so-called being, Buddhism does not assert the exist- ence of an immortal soul, or an eternal ego, which man has obtained in a mysterious way from an equally mysterious source. A soul which is eternal must necessarily remain always the same without any change whatever. If the soul which is supposed to be the essence of man is eternal, there could be neither a rise nor a fall. Nor could one explain why ‘different souls are so variously constituted at the outset.’ To justify the existence of endless felicity in an eternal heaven and unending torment in an eternal hell, it is absolutely necessary to postulate an immortal soul. “It should be said,” writes a philosopher, “that the old distinction between soul and body has evaporated, quite as much because ‘matter’ has lost its solidity as because mind has lost its spirituality. Psychology is just beginning to be scientifi c. In the present state of psychology belief in immortality can at any rate claim no support from science.”"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"467 According to the learned author of the Riddle of the Universe: “This theological proof that a personal creator has breathed an immortal soul (generally regarded as a portion of the divine soul) into man is a pure myth. The cosmological proof that the ‘moral order of the world’ demands the eternal duration of the human soul is a baseless dogma. The teleological proof that the ‘higher destiny’ of man involves the perfecting of his defective, earthly soul beyond the grave – rests on a false anthropism. The moral proof – that the defects and the unsatisfi ed desires of earthly existence must be fulfi lled by ‘compensative justice’ on the other side of eternity – is nothing more than a pious wish. The ethnological proof – that the belief in immortality, like the belief in God, is an innate truth, common to all humanity – is an error in fact. The ontological proof – that the soul, being a simple, immaterial, and indivisible entity cannot be involved in the corruption of death – is based on an entirely erroneous view of the psychic phenomena; it is a spiritualistic fallacy. All these and similar ‘proofs of athanatism’ are in a parlous condition; they are defi nitely annulled by the scientifi c criticism of the last few decades.” If nothing in the form of a spirit or soul passes from this life to the other, what is it that is reborn? In this question it is taken for granted that there is some thing to be re-born. A few centuries ago it was argued – “ Cogito, ergo sum ” (I think, therefore I am). True, but fi rst it has to be proved that there is an “I” to think. We say that the sun rises in the East and sets in the West, although we know that actu- ally it is not so. We have to admit that one cannot strike an identical place twice although to all appearance one has done so. Everything changes so soon. For no two moments are we identically the same. Buddhists agree with a philosopher when he says, “There is obvi- ously some reason in which I am the same person as I was yesterday, and, to take an even more obvious example, if I simultaneously see a man and hear him speaking, there is some sense in which I see and hear.” Brahma : These stanzas state that the self-conquest achieved by a person cannot be undone either by a gandhabba or Brahmas .

Deva : (lit. the Radiant Ones; related to Lat. deus ), Heavenly Beings, deities, celestials; are beings who live in happy worlds, and who, as a rule, are invisible to the human eye.

Commentary brahma : In several verses of this Chapter, references are made to Brahma. Besides the stories that have occasioned the pronouncing of several of these stanzas, too, have to do with those who practiced various rites and rituals, with the intention of attaining the Brahma world. What is the Buddhist attitude to the concept of Brahma and the Brahma worlds? In Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta (Buddha’s First Sermon – The Turning of the Wheel of Righteousness) reference is made to Brahma worlds. Hearing this, the Devas Càtummàhàràjikà, Tàvatiüsa, Yàma, Tusita, Nim- mànaratã, Paranimmitavasavattã, and the Brahmas of Brahma Pàrisajja, Brahma Purohita, Mahà Brahma, Parittàbha, Appamànasubha, âbhassara, Parittasubha, Appamànasubha, Subhakinna Vehapphala, Avãha, Atappa, Sudassa, Sudassã, and Akaniññha, also raised the same joyous cry. Thus at that very moment, at that very instant, this cry extended as far as the Brahma realm. These ten thousand world systems quaked, shook and trembled violently. Throughout Buddhist Literature, references are made to Brahma; but in the Buddhist system, one’s liberation is not sought through sacrifi ces to gods. Brahma world is considered the abode of the creator-god (Mahà Brahma). The idea that Brahma is the creator-god is sarcastically dismissed in Bhåridatta Jàtaka (The Birth Story). This Jàtaka Tale (Birth Story) enquires thus: “He who has eyes can see the sickening sight, Why does not Brahma set his creatures right?” Although there is a heavenly being called Mahà Brahma, who believes he is the creator, and whom the bràhmins believe is the creator, and is recognized in Buddhism, Buddhists do not believe that he is the creator of the world."},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"109.

Once, there were two hermits who lived together prac- ticing religious austerities for forty-eight years. Later, one of the two left the hermit life and got married. After a son was born, the family visited the old hermit and paid obeisance to him. To the parents the hermit said, “May you live long.” but he said nothing to the child. The parents were puzzled and asked the hermit the reason for his silence. The hermit told them that the child would live only seven more days and that he did not know how to prevent his death, but the Buddha might know how to do it. So the parents took the child to the Buddha; when they paid obeisance to the Buddha, he also said, “May you live long” to the parents only and not to the child. The Buddha also predicted the impending death of the child. To prevent his death, the parents were told to build a pavilion at the entrance to the house, and put the child on a couch in the pavilion. Then some monks were sent there to recite the parit- tàs (protective chants) for seven days. On the seventh day the Buddha himself came to that pavilion; the devas from all over the universe also came.

This time, the Buddha said “May you live long” to the child. When asked how long the child would live, the Buddha replied that he would live up to one hundred and twenty years. So the child was named âyuvaóóhana. When the child grew up, he went about the country with a company of fi ve hundred fellow devotees. One day, they came to the Jetavana Monastery, and the monks, recog- nizing him, asked the Buddha, “For beings is there any means of gaining longevity?” To this question the Buddha answered, “By respecting and honouring the elders and those who are wise and virtuous, one would gain not only longevity, but also beauty, happiness and strength.” Explanatory Translation (Verse 109) abhivàdana sãlissa niccaü vaóóhàpacàino àyu vaõõo sukhaü balaü cattàro dhammà vaóóhanti abhivàdana sãlissa : of those who are in the habit of hon- ouring and respecting; niccaü : constantly; vaóóhàpacàino : those who are developed and mature in mind; àyu : length of life; vanno : complexion; sukhaü : comfort; balaü : strength; cattàro dhammà : four things; vaóóhanti : increase"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"481 If a person is in the habit of constantly honouring and respect- ing those who are developed and mature, their lives improve in four ways.

Once a monk was not feeling happy with the life of a monk; at the same time he felt that it would be improper and humiliating for him to return to the life of a householder. So he thought it would be better to die. So thinking this, on one occasion, he put his hand into a pot where there was a snake but the snake did not bite him. This was because in a past existence the snake was a slave and the monk was his master. Because of this incident the monk was known as Venerable Sappadàsa. On another occasion, Venerable Sappadàsa took a razor to cut his throat; but as he placed the razor on his throat he refl ected on the purity of his morality practice throughout his life as a monk and his whole body was suffused with delightful satisfaction ( pãti ) and bliss ( sukha ). Then detaching himself from pãti , he directed his mind to the development of insight knowledge and soon attained arahatship, and he returned to the monastery. On arrival at the monastery, other monks asked him where he had been and why he took the knife along with him. When he told them about his intention to take his life, they asked him why he did not do so.

As the monk walks in meditation, he can attain arahatship even before his raised foot touches the ground.” Explanatory Translation (Verse 112) kusãto hãnavãriyo yo ca vassasataü jãve daëhaü viriyaü àrabhato ekàhaü jãvitaü seyyo kusãto : lazy; hãnavãryo : without initiative, lethargic; yo : an individual; ca : if; vassasataü : hundred years; jãve : were to live; daëhaü viriyaü : full of effort; àrabhato : who develops; ekàhaü jãvitaü : even one day’s life; seyyo : is noble A single day’s life of a wise person who is capable of strenu- ous effort, is nobler than even hundred years of life of an individual who is lazy, incapable of making an effort and is wanting in initiative.

It is defi ned as the persistent effort"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"493 to purify the mind. Firmly establishing himself in this virtue, the Bodhisatta develops viriya and makes it one of his prominent charac- teristics. The Viriya of a Bodhisatta is clearly depicted in the Mahàjanaka Jàtaka . Shipwrecked in the open sea for seven days he struggled on without once giving up hope until he was fi nally rescued. Failures he views as steps to success, opposition causes him to double his exertion, dangers increase his courage. Cutting his way through dif- fi culties, which impair the enthusiasm of the feeble, surmounting obstacles, which dishearten the ordinary, he looks straight towards his goal. Nor does he ever stop until his goal is reached. To Màra who advised the Bodhisatta to abandon his quest, he said, “Death, in battle with passions seems to me more honourable than a life of defeat.” Just as his wisdom is always directed to the service of others, so also is his fund of energy. Instead of confi ning it to the narrow course leading to the realization of personal ends, he directs it into the open channel of activities that tend to universal happiness. Ceaselessly and untiringly he works for others, expecting no remuneration in return or reward. He is ever ready to serve others to the best of his ability. In certain respects, Viriya plays an even greater part than Pa¤¤ à in the achievement of the goal. In one who treads the noble eight-fold path, right effort ( sammà vàyàma or viriya ) prevents the arising of evil states, removes those which have arisen, cultivates good states, and maintains and develops those good states which have already arisen. It serves as one of the seven factors of enlightenment ( viriya sambojjhanga ). It is one of the four means of accomplishment ( viriyid- dhipàda ). It is viriya that performs the function of the four modes of right endeavour ( sammappadhàna ). It is one of the fi ve powers ( viriya bala ) and one of the fi ve controlling faculties ( viriyindriya ). Viriya therefore may be regarded as an offi cer that performs nine functions. It is this persistent effort to develop the mind that serves as a powerful hand to achieve all ends."},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"113.

Patàcàrà was the daughter of a rich man from Sàvatthi. She was very beautiful and was guarded very strictly by her parents. But one day, she eloped with a young male attendant of the family and went to live in a village, as a poor man’s wife. In due course she became pregnant and as the time for confi ne- ment drew near, she asked permission from her husband to return to her parents in Sàvatthi, but her husband discouraged her. So, one day, while her husband was away, she set out for the home of her parents. He followed her and caught up with her on the way and pleaded with her to return with him; but she refused.

Saying to herself that her husband died on account of her, she continued on her way to her parents. Because it had rained incessantly the whole night, the Aciravati River was in spate; so it was not possible for her to cross the river carrying both her sons. Leaving the elder boy on this side of the river, she crossed the stream with her day-old son and left him on the other bank. She then came back for the elder boy. While she was still in the middle of the river, a large hawk hovered over the younger child taking it for a piece of meat. She shouted to frighten away the bird, but it was all in vain; the child was carried away by the hawk. Meanwhile, the elder boy heard his mother shouting from the middle of the stream and thought she was calling out to him to come to her. So he entered the stream to go to his mother, and was carried away by the strong current. Thus Patàcàrà lost her two sons as well as her husband. So she wept and lamented loudly, “A son is carried away by a hawk, another son is carried away by the current, my husband is also dead, bitten by a poisonous snake!” Then, she saw a man from Sàvatthi and she tearfully asked after her parents. The man replied that due to a violent storm in Sàvatthi the previous night, the house of her parents had fallen down and that both her parents, together with her three brothers, had died, and had been cremated on one funeral pyre. On hearing this tragic news, Patàcàrà went stark mad. She did not even notice that her clothes had fallen off from her and that she was half-naked.

The boy died when he was just a toddler and Kisàgotami was stricken with grief. Carrying the dead body of her son, she went about asking for medicine that would restore her son to life from everyone she happened to meet. People began to think that she had gone mad. But a wise man seeing her condition thought that he should be of some help to her. So, he said to her, “The Buddha is the person you should approach, he has the medicine you want; go to him.” Thus, she went to the Buddha and asked him to give her the medicine that would restore her dead son to life. The Buddha told her to get some mustard seeds from a house where there had been no death.

But all living beings are subject to an unchanging law, and it is this: The prince of death, like a raging torrent, sweeps away into the sea of ruin all living beings; with their longings still unfulfi lled. Gotami, you thought that you were the only one who had lost a son. As you have now realized, death comes to all beings; before their desires are fulfi lled death takes them away.” On hearing this, Kisàgotami fully realized the impermanence, unsatisfactori- ness and insubstantiality of the aggregates and attained sotàpatti fruition. Soon afterwards, Kisàgotami became a nun. One day, as she was lighting the lamps she saw the fl ames fl aring up and dying out, and suddenly she clearly perceived the arising and the perishing of beings. The Buddha, through supernor- mal power, saw her from his monastery, and sent forth his radiance and appeared to her in person.

There was once a bràhmin couple in Sàvatthi, who had only one outer garment between the two of them. Because of this they were also known as Ekasàñaka. As they had only one outer garment, both of them could not go out at the same time. So, the wife would go to listen to the discourse given by the Buddha during the day and the husband would go at night. One night, as the bràhmin listened to the Buddha, his whole body came to be suffused with delightful satisfaction and he felt a strong desire to offer the outer garment he was wearing to the Buddha. But he realized that if he were to give away the only outer garment he had, there would be none left for him and his wife. So he wavered and hesitated. Thus, the fi rst and the second watches of the night passed. Came the third watch and he said to himself, “If I am so miserly and hesitant, I will miss the opportunity of ending worldly suffer- ing. I shall now offer my outer garment to the Buddha.” So saying, he placed the piece of cloth at the feet of the Buddha and cried out “I have won” three times. King Pasenadi of Kosala, who was among the audience, heard those words and ordered a courtier to investigate.

Thus, he offered to the Buddha whatever was given him by the king, and each time the king doubled his reward. When fi nally the reward came up to thirty-two pieces of cloth, the bràhmin kept one piece for himself and another for his wife, and offered the remaining thirty pieces to the Buddha. Then, the king again commented that the bràhmin had truly performed a very diffi cult task and so must be rewarded fi ttingly. The king sent a messenger to the palace to bring two pieces of velvet cloth, each of which was worth one hundred thousand, and gave them to the bràhmin. The bràhmin made these two pieces of valuable cloth into two canopies and kept one in the perfumed chamber where the Buddha slept and the other in his own house above the place where a monk was regularly offered alms-food. When the king next went to the Jetavana Monastery to pay homage to the Buddha, he saw the velvet canopy and recognized it as the offering made by the bràhmin and he was very pleased.

One and all sought ordination and became arahats. Yet they forgot their mission. Finally he dispatched Kàludàyi, the most trusted follower.

Unwholesome are all those karmi- cal volitions and the consciousness and mental concomitants associ- ated therewith, which are accompanied either by greed ( lobha ) or hate ( dosa ) or merely delusion ( moha ); and all these phenomena are causes of un favourable Kamma results and contain the seeds of unhappy destiny or rebirth. akusala-sàdhàrana-cetasika : general unwholesome ( pàpa ) mental fac- tors associated with all unwholesome actions (volitions), are four: (1) lack of moral shame ( ahirika ); (2) lack of moral dread ( anottappa ); (3) restless- ness ( uddhacca ); (4) delusion ( moha ). måla : roots, also called hetu , are those conditions which through their presence determine the actual moral quality of a volitional state ( cetanà ), and the consciousness and mental factors associated therewith, in other words, the quality of kamma. There are six such roots, three kammic- ally wholesome and three unwholesome roots, viz.: greed, hate, delu- sion ( lobha , dosa , moha ) and greedlessness, hatelessness, undeludedness ( alobha , adosa , amoha ). Greed arises through unwise refl ection on an attractive object, hate through unwise refl ection on a repulsive object. Thus, greed ( lobha or ràga ) comprises all degrees of attractedness towards an object from the faintest trace of a longing thought up to grossest egoism, whilst hatred ( dosa ) comprises all degrees of repulsion from the faintest trace of ill-humour up to the highest pitch of hate and wrath. Those pàpa (unwholesome) actions – killing, stealing, unlawful sexual intercourse, lying, tale-bearing, harsh language, frivolous talk, covetousness, ill-will and wrong views – these things are either due to greed, or hate, or delusion. Enraptured with lust (greed), enraged with hate, blinded by delu- sion, overwhelmed, with mind ensnared, man aims at his own ruin, at others’ ruin, at the ruin of both, and he experiences mental pain and grief. And he follows evil ways in deeds, words and thought and he really knows neither his own welfare, nor the welfare of others, nor the welfare of both. These things make him blind and ignorant, hinder his knowledge, are painful, and do not lead him to peace."},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"118.

For a while Venerable Kassapa the Great was in residence at Pipphalã Cave, he entered into a state of trance, remaining therein for seven days. Arising from trance on the seventh day, he surveyed with supernatural vision the places where he wanted to go for alms. As he looked abroad, he beheld a cer- tai n woma n, t he keeper of a fi eld of rice-paddy, parching heads of rice which she had gathered. Thereupon he considered within himself, “Is she endowed with faith or is she not endowed with faith?” Straightaway becoming aware that she was endowed with faith, he refl ected, “Will she be able to render me assistance?” Straightaway he became aware of the following, “This noble young woman is wise and resourceful; she will render me assistance, and as the result of so doing will receive a rich reward.” So he put on his robes, took bowl in hand, and went and stood near the rice-fi eld. When this noble young woman saw the Venerable, her heart believed, and her body was suffused with the fi ve sorts of joy. “Wait a moment, Venerable,” said she. Taking some of the parched rice, she went quickly to him, poured the rice into the Venerable’s bowl, and then, saluting him with the fi ve rests, she made an earnest wish, saying, “Venerable, may I be a partaker of the Truth you have seen?” “So be it,” replied the Venerable, pro- nouncing the words of thanksgiving. Then that noble young"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"516 woman saluted the Venerable and set out to return, refl ecting upon the alms she had given to the Venerable. Now in a certain hole by the road skirting the fi eld of growing rice lurked a poisonous snake. He was not able to bite the Venerable’s leg, for it was covered with his yellow robe. But as that noble young woman reached that spot on her return, refl ecting upon the alms she had given to the Venerable, the snake wriggled out of his hole, bit her, and then and there caused her to fall prostrate on the ground. Dying with believ- ing heart, she was reborn in heaven. As a goddess she came down from time to time and attended to the upkeep of the Ven- erable’s place – cleaning the premises etc. When the Venerable saw what had been done, he concluded, “Some probationer or novice must have rendered me this service.” On the second day the goddess did the same thing again, and the Venerable again came to the same conclusion. But on the third day the Venerable heard the sound of her sweeping, and looking in through the keyhole, saw the radiant image of her body. And straightaway he asked, “Who is it that is sweeping?” “It is I, Venerable, your female disciple the goddess Làjà.” “I have no female disciple by that name.” “Venerable, when I was a young woman tending a rice-fi eld, I gave you parched rice; as I returned on my way, a snake bit me, and I died with believing heart and was reborn in the Heavenly World. Since it was through you that I received this glory, I said to myself, ‘I will perform the major and minor duties for you and so make my salvation sure.’ Therefore came I hither, Venerable.” “Was it you that swept this place for me yesterday and on the preceding days, setting out water for drinking?” “Yes, Venerable.” “Pray depart hence, goddess."},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"517 Never mind about the duties you have rendered, but henceforth come no more hither.” “Venerable, do not destroy me.

Anàthapiõóika, who spent fi fty-four billion of treasure in the religion of the Buddha on Jetavana Monastery alone, proceeded in state three times a day to wait upon the Buddha during the Buddha’s residence at Jetavana. Whenever he set out to go thither, he thought, “The probationers and novices will look at my hands and ask the question, ‘What has he brought with him as offerings?’” and therefore never went empty-handed. When he went there early in the morning he carried rice- porridge with him; after breakfast he carried ghee, fresh but- ter, and other medicaments; in the evening he carried with him perfumes, garlands, unguents, and garments. Now those who lived by trade had borrowed from him eighteen billion of treasure. Moreover eighteen billion of treasure belonging to his family, secretly buried at the bank of the river, had been swept into the great ocean at the time when the river burst its banks. The result was that he was gradually being reduced to a state of poverty. But in spite of this, he just gave alms to the Congregation of Monks as before, although he was unable to give choice food as before."},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"520 One day the Buddha asked him, “Are alms provided for us in the house of our householder?” Anàthapiõóika replied, “Yes, Venerable, but the food is nothing but bird-feed and sour gruel.” Then said the Buddha to him, “Householder, do not allow yourself to think, ‘It is nothing but coarse food that I give to the Buddha,’ and be not disturbed thereat. If the inten- tion be pure, it is impossible to give the Buddhas and others food that is really coarse.” When the Buddha and the Buddha’s disciples entered the house of Anàthapiõóika, the goddess who dwelt over the gate, unable to remain, by reason of the intensity of their goodness, thought to herself, “I will detach the householder from his allegiance, that they may no more enter this house.” Now although the goddess had longed to address the house- holder, she could not say a word to him in the heyday of his wealth and power. At this time, however, she thought to her- self, “The householder is now a poor man, and will therefore be disposed to give heed to my words.” Accordingly she went by night, entered the treasurer’s chamber of state, and stood poised in the air. When the treasurer saw her, he said, “Who is that?” “It is I, great treasurer, the goddess that resides over your fourth gate. I am come to give you admonition.” “Well then, say what you have to say.” “Great treasurer, without considering the future, you have dissipated your great wealth in the religion of the monk Gotama.

Leave my house instantly.” The goddess, unable to withstand the words of a noble disciple who had attained the fruit of conversion, left his house, taking her children with her. But after the goddess had left his house, she was unable to fi nd lodging elsewhere. Then she thought to herself, “I will ask the treasurer to pardon me and to allow me to resume my residence in this house.” Accordingly she approached the tutelary deity of the city, told him of her offense, and said to him, “Come now, conduct me to the treasurer, persuade him to pardon me, and persuade him to allow me to resume my residence in his house.” But the tutelary deity of the city replied, “You said something you had no business to say; it will be impossible for me to go with you to the treasurer’s residence.” Thus did the tutelary deity of the city refuse her request. Then she went to the Four Great Kings, but they like- wise refused her request. Then she approached Sakka king of gods, told him her story, and entreated him yet more earnestly. Said she, “Sire, I am unable to fi nd a place wherein to lodge myself, but wander about without protection, children in hand.

When other monks chided him for his irre- sponsible behaviour, he would retort, “I do not have the inten- tion to destroy those things; after all, very little damage has been done,” and so on and so forth and he continued to behave in the same way. When the Buddha came to know about this, he sent for the monk and said to him, “Monk, you should not behave in this way; you should not think lightly of an evil act, however small it may be; because, it will grow big if you do it habitually.” Explanatory Translation (Verse 121) taü maü na àgamissati pàpassa mà appama¤¤etha udabindu nipàtena api udakumbho pårati thokathokaü api àcinaü bàlo pàpassa pårati taü : that minor evil: maü : towards me; na àgamissati : will not bring evil results; pàpassa : about evil action; mà appama¤¤etha : do not underestimate; udabindu nipàtena api : only drop by drop; udakumbho : the water pot; pårati : gets filled; thokathokaü api : even little by little; àcinaü : accumulating; bàlo : the ignorant; pàpassa : by evil; pårati : gets filled"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"528 Some tend to believe that evil can be taken lightly.

Little by little the evil accumulates, until he is fi lled with it. Commentary Requisites of a Monk . This stanza was pronounced by the Buddha, about a monk who misuses the requisites of monastic life. The requi- sites of a monk are traditionally very simple. So far as a monk is con- cerned there are four requisites ( catu paccaya ) for progress on the path to purity and freedom. They are robes, food, a lodging and medicine. These are the bare necessities without which no human being can live. Basically they are also the fundamental needs of a layman. It was the Buddha’s custom to ask the monks on meeting them: “How is it with you; how are you faring? I trust you are well, and that you are not short of food.” There is the touching tale of a herdsman who, in looking for a lost ox, missed his midday meal. On his way back, fatigued and hun- gry, he went to the Buddha to listen to him preaching. The Blessed One, however, knowing that the man had not eaten all day, inquired from the people if he could fi rst be fed. The Buddha knew that it was profi t- less to preach to this man without fi rst satisfying his hunger. Although the Buddha did not focus mainly on material progress, he did not entirely ignore it. The Buddha was very outspoken with regard to certain aspects of material conditions and social welfare. It is an admitted fact that poverty is a contributory cause of crime. If people are deprived of the four requisites mentioned above, the bare necessities, or if these are scarce, especially food, people’s minds are not at rest. They cannot and do not think of moral behav- iour, or give a thought to righteous living. Necessity has no law, and they stoop to unjust and unrighteous ways of gaining a subsistence. Owing to lack of economic security, and of money, people are led to commit theft and other crimes. The Kåtadantasutta states how in order to raise the social and economic conditions of a country, the farmers"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"529 and traders should be given the necessary facilities to carry on their farming and business, and that people should be paid adequate wages. Thus when they have enough for their subsistence and are economi- cally secure, crime is lessened and peace and harmony prevail. In another discourse, the Buddha explains to Anàthapiõóika (the banker who donated to the Sangha the Jetavana Monastery), the four kinds of happiness a layman ought to enjoy. The fi rst is the satis- faction of ownership ( atthi-sukha ), or economic security, so that he has suffi cient means acquired lawfully by his own efforts; the second is the joy of consumption ( bogha-sukha ) or happiness gained by the judicious use of lawful wealth; the third is the happiness of freedom from debt ( anana-sukha ), the joy and satisfaction that comes with the thought, I owe nothing to anyone”; the fourth is the bliss of innocence ( anavajja- sukha ), which is the satisfaction derived from the thought, “I am blessed with blameless acts of body, speech and mind.” All these discussions and sermons in Buddhism go to show that the layman, as a member of society, should work hard to earn a liv- ing and strengthen his economic and social security, lest he becomes a burden to himself and others, but at the same time he should avoid wrong and unrighteous ways of living and not deviate from the path of self sacrifi ce, charity, self control, moderation, patience, detachment, meditation, etc. The Buddha’s instructions and advice on right livelihood are addressed both to the layman and to the members of the Sangha. He has clearly explained to his disciples that the monk’s life should be absolutely pure and free from fraud. The Master is indeed very emphatic on this matter, for he says: “Monks, whatsoever monks are cheats, stubborn, babblers, cunning, passionate, proud, uncalmed – such monks are no followers of mine. They have fallen away from this Dhamma-vinaya (Doctrine and Discipline), nor do they grow, increase and prosper in this Dhamma-vinaya . Further says the Master: “Monks, this holy life ( brahmacariyaü ) is lived neither to cheat people nor for scheming, nor for profi t and favour, nor for the sake of honour. It is not for gossiping, nor with the intention: ‘let people know me as so-and-so.’ But, monks, this holy life is lived for the sake of restraint, for abandon- ing, for dispassion, for cessation.”"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"122.

Once, a man from Sàvatthi, having heard a discourse given by the Buddha, was very much impressed, and decided to practice what was taught by the Buddha. The exhortation was to give in charity not only by oneself but also to get others to do so and that by so doing one would gain much merit and have a large number of followers in the next existence. So, that man invited the Buddha and all the resident monks in the Jeta- vana Monastery for alms-food the next day. Then he went round to each one of the houses and informed the residents that alms-food would be offered the next day to the Buddha and other ‘monks and so to contribute according to their wishes. The rich man Bilàlapàdaka seeing the man going round from house to house disapproved of his behaviour and felt a strong dislike for him and murmured to himself “O this wretched man! Why did he not invite as many monks as he could himself offer alms, instead of going round coaxing people!” So he asked the man to bring his bowl and into this bowl, he put only a little rice, only a little butter, only a little molass. These were taken away separately and not mixed with what others had given. The rich man could not understand why his things were kept separately, and he thought perhaps that man wanted others to know that a rich man like him had contributed very little and so put him to shame. Therefore, he sent a servant to fi nd out."},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"532 The promoter of charity put a little of everything that was given by the rich man into various pots of rice and curry and sweetmeats so that the rich man may gain much merit. His servant reported what he had seen; but Bilàlapàdaka did not get the meaning and was not sure of the intention of the promoter of charity. However, the next day he went to the place where alms-food was being offered. At the same time, he took a knife with him, intending to kill the chief promoter of charity, if he were to reveal in public just how little a rich man like him had contributed. But this promoter of charity said to the Buddha, “Vener- able, this charity is a joint offering of all; whether one has given much or little is of no account; each one of us has given in faith and generosity; so may all of us gain equal merit.” When he heard those words, Bilàlapàdaka realized that he had wronged the man and pondered that if he were not to own up his mistake and ask the promoter of charity to pardon him, he would be reborn in one of the four lower worlds ( apàyas ). So he said, “My friend, I have done you a great wrong by thinking ill of you; please forgive me.” The Buddha heard the rich man asking for pardon, and on enquiry found out the reason. So, the Buddha said, “My disciple, you should not think lightly of a good deed, however small it may be, for small deeds will become big if you do them habitually.

In the meantime, they heard that the merchant would soon be going out with fi ve hundred carts loaded with valuable merchandise. The mer- chant Mahàdhana also invited the monks who would like to go on the same journey to accompany him, and he promised to look to their needs on the way. So, fi ve hundred monks accom- panied him. The robbers got news of the trip and went ahead to lie in wait for the caravan of the merchant. But the merchant stopped at the outskirts of the forest where the robbers were waiting. The caravan was to move on after camping there for a few days. The robbers got the news of the impending depar- ture and made ready to loot the caravan; the merchant, in his turn, also got news of the movements of the bandits and he decided to return home. The bandits now heard that the mer- chant would go home; so they waited on the homeward way.

At Ràjagaha there was once a rich man’s daughter who had attained sotàpatti fruition as a young girl. One day, Kuk- kuña mitta, a hunter, came into town in a cart to sell venison. Seeing Kukkuñamitta the hunter, the rich young lady fell in love with him immediately; she followed him, married him and lived with him in a small village. As a result of that mar- riage, seven sons were born to them and in course of time, all the sons got married. One day, the Buddha surveyed the world early in the morning with his supernormal power and found that the hunter, his seven sons and their wives were due for attainment of sotàpatti fruition. So, the Buddha went to the place where the hunter had set his trap in the forest. He put his footprint close to the trap and seated himself under the shade of a bush, not far from the trap. When the hunter came, he saw no animal in the trap; he saw the footprint and surmised that someone must have come before him and let out the animal. So, when he saw the Buddha under the shade of the bush, he took him for the man who had freed the animal from his trap and fl ew into a rage.

When the hunter and his sons failed to return, the hunter’s wife followed them into the forest, with her seven daughters-in-law. Seeing her husband and all her sons with their arrows aimed at the Buddha, she raised both her hands and shouted, “Do not kill my father.” When her husband heard her words, he thought, “This must be my father-in-law”, and her sons thought, “This must be our grandfather” and thoughts of loving-kindness came into them. Then the lady said to them, “Put away your bows and arrows and pay obeisance to my father.” The Buddha realized that, by this time, the minds of the hunter and his sons had softened and so he willed that they should be able to move and to put away their bows and arrows. After putting away their bows and arrows, they paid obeisance to the Buddha and the Buddha expounded the Dhamma to them. In the end, the hunter, his seven sons and seven daughters-in- law, all fi fteen of them, attained sotàpatti fruition. Then the Buddha returned to the monastery and told Venerable ânanda and other monks about the hunter Kukkuñamitta and his family attaining sotàpatti fruition in the early part of the morning. The monks then asked the Buddha, “Venerable, is the wife of the hunter, who is a sotàpanna, also not guilty of taking life, if she has been getting things like nets, bows and arrows for her husband when he goes out hunting?” To this question the Buddha answered, “Monks, the sotàpannas do"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"541 not kill, they do not wish others to get killed.

He took that as a bad omen and grumbled to himself, “Since I have seen this wretched one, I don’t think I would get anything today,” and he went on his way. As expected by him, he did not get anything. On his way home also, he saw the same monk returning to the monastery, and the hunter became very angry. So he set his hounds on the monk. Swiftly, the monk climbed up a tree to a level just out of reach of the hounds. Then the hunter went to the foot of the tree and pricked the heels of the monk with the tip of his arrow. The monk was in great pain and was not able to hold his robes on; so the robes slipped off his body on to the hunter who was at the foot of the tree. The dogs seeing the yellow robe thought that the monk had fallen off the tree and pounced on the body, biting and pulling at it furiously. The monk, from his shelter in the tree, broke a dry branch and threw it at the dogs. Then the dogs discovered that they had been attacking their own master instead of the monk, and ran away into the forest. The monk came down from the tree and found that the hunter had died and felt sorry for him.

One day, while the gem polisher was handling meat, a messenger of King Pasenadi of Kosala arrived with a ruby, which was to be cut and polished and sent back to the king. The gem polisher took the ruby with his hand which was covered with blood, put it on a table and went into the house to wash his hands. The pet crane of the family, seeing the blood stained ruby and mistak- ing it for a piece of meat, picked it up and swallowed it in the presence of the Venerable. When the gem polisher returned, he found that the ruby was missing. He asked his wife and his son and they answered that they had not taken it. Then, he asked the Venerable who said that he did not take it. The gem polisher was not satisfi ed. As there was no one else in the house, the gem polisher concluded that it must be the Ven- erable who had taken the precious ruby: so he told his wife that he must torture the Venerable to get admission of theft. But his wife replied, “This Venerable had been our guide and teacher for the last twelve years, and we have never seen him doing anything evil; please do not accuse the Vener- able.

The gem polisher, who was by then in a great rage, kicked the crane with all his might and the bird died instantaneously. Then, the Venerable said, “Please see whether the crane is dead or not,” and the gem polisher replied, “You too shall die like this crane.” When the Venera- ble was sure the crane had died, he said, softly, “My disciple, the crane swallowed the ruby.” Hearing this, the gem polisher cut up the crane and found the ruby in the stomach. Then, the gem polisher realized his mistake and trembled with fear. He pleaded with the Venerable to pardon him and also to continue to come to his door for alms. The Venerable replied, “My disciple, it is not your fault, nor is it mine. This has happened on account of what has been done in our previous existences; it is just our debt in saüsàra; I feel no ill will towards you. As a matter of fact, this has happened because I have entered a house. From today, I would not enter any house; I would only stand at the door.” Soon after saying this, the Venerable expired as a result of his injuries. Later, the monks asked the Buddha where the various characters in the above episode were reborn, and the Buddha answered, “The crane was reborn as the son of the gem pol- isher; the gem polisher was reborn in Niraya (Hell); the wife of the gem polisher was reborn in one of the deva worlds; and the Venerable, who was already an arahat when he was living, attained Parinibbàna.”"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"548 Explanatory Translation (Verse 126) eke gabbhaü uppajjanti pàpakammino nirayaü sugatino saggaü yanti anàsavà parinibbanti eke : some; gabbhaü : in a womb; uppajjanti : get conceived; pàpakammino : evil doers; nirayaü : in hell (are born) sug- atino : those who have good ways; saggaü : heaven; yanti : reach; anàsavà : those who are free of taints and corrup- tions; parinibbanti : achieve total Nibbàna Some, after their death, receive conception in wombs.

The monks, seeing the dead crow, observed that only the Buddha would be able to explain for what evil deed this crow had to die in this manner. After taking alms-food, they went to the Buddha, to ask about the crow. Another group of monks were on their way to pay homage to the Buddha. When they were in the middle of the ocean, the boat could not be moved. So, lots were drawn to fi nd out who the unlucky one was. Three times the lot fell on the wife of the skipper. Then the skipper said sorrowfully, “Many people should not die on account of this unlucky woman; tie a pot of sand to her neck and throw her into the water.” The woman was thrown into the sea and the ship started to move. On arrival at their destination, the monks disembarked and continued on their way to the Buddha. They also intended to ask the Buddha due to what evil kamma the unfortunate woman was thrown overboard. A group of seven monks also went to pay homage to the Buddha. On the way, they enquired at a monastery and they were directed to a cave, and there they spent the night; but in the middle of the night, a large boulder slipped off from above and closed the entrance.

They also intended to ask the Buddha due to what previous evil deed they were thus shut up for seven days in a cave. The three groups of travelling monks went to the Buddha. Each group related to the Buddha what they had seen on their way and the Buddha answered their questions. The Buddha’s answer to the fi rst group: “Monks, once there was a farmer who had a very lazy and stubborn ox. The farmer, in anger, tied a straw rope round the neck of the ox and set fi re to it, and the ox died. On account of this evil deed, the farmer had suffered for a long time in Hell (Niraya) He had been burnt to death in the last seven existences.” The past actions brought on the present suffering. The Buddha’s answer to the second group: “Monks, once there was a woman who had a dog. Whatever she did and wherever she went the dog always followed her. As a result, some young boys would poke fun at her. She was very angry and felt so ashamed that she planned to kill the dog. She fi lled a pot with sand, tied it round the neck of the dog and threw it into the water; and the dog was drowned. On account of this evil deed, that woman had suffered for a long time and, in serving the remaining part of the effect, she had been thrown into the water to be drowned.” The Buddha’s answer to the third group: “Monks, once, seven cowherds saw an iguana going into a mound and, for fun, they closed all the outlets of the mound.

King Suppabuddha was the father of Devadatta and father-in-law of Prince Siddhattha who later became Gotama Buddha. King Suppabuddha was very antagonistic to the Buddha for two reasons. First, because as Prince Siddhattha he had left his wife Yasodharà, the daughter of King Sup- pabuddha, to renounce the world; and secondly, because his son Devadatta, who was admitted into the Order by Gotama Buddha, had come to regard the Buddha as his arch enemy. One day, knowing that the Buddha would be coming for alms- food, he got himself drunk and blocked the way. When the Buddha and the monks came, Suppabuddha refused to make way, and sent a message saying, I cannot give way to Samana Gotama, who is so much younger than me.” Finding the road blocked, the Buddha and the monks turned back. Suppabud- dha then sent someone to follow the Buddha secretly and fi nd out what the Buddha said, and to report to him. As the Buddha turned back, he said to ânanda, “ânanda, because King Suppabuddha refused to give way to me, on the seventh day from now he will be swallowed up by the earth, at the foot of the steps leading to the pinnacled hall of his palace.” The king’s spy heard these words and reported to the king.

Whether King Suppabuddha lives in a pinnacled tower, or up in the sky, or in an ocean or in a cave, my word cannot go wrong; King Suppabuddha will be swallowed up by the earth at the very place I have told you.” On the seventh day, about the time of the alms meal the royal horse got frightened for some unknown reason and started neighing loudly and kicking about furiously. Hearing frightening noises from his horse, the king felt that he must handle his pet horse and forgetting all precautions, he started towards the door. The door opened of its own accord, the steps which had been pulled down earlier were also there, his men forgot to stop him from going down. So the king went down the stairs and as soon as he stepped on the earth, it opened and swallowed him up and dragged him right down to Avãci Hell. Thus, no matter how hard he tried, the foolish king was unable to escape the effects of his evil kamma.

The Paticca-Samuppàda describes the process of rebirth in subtle technical terms and assigns death to one of the following four causes: 1) Exhaustion of the reproductive kammic energy ( kammakkhaya ). The Buddhist belief is that, as a rule, the thought, volition, or desire, which is extremely strong during lifetime, becomes predominant at the time of death and conditions the subsequent birth. In this last thought-process is present a special potentiality. When the potential energy of this reproductive ( janaka ). Kamma is exhausted, the organic activities of the material form in which is embodied the life-force, cease even before the end of the life-span in that particular place. This often happens in the case of beings who are born in states of misery ( apàya ) but it can also happen in other planes. 2) The expiration of the life-term ( àyukkhaya ), which varies in different planes. Natural deaths, due to old age, may be classed under this category. There are different planes of existence with varying age-limits. Irrespective of the kammic force that has yet to run, one must, however, succumb to death when the maximum age-limit is reached. If the reproductive kammic force is extremely powerful, the kammic energy rematerialises itself in the same plane or, as in the case of devas, in some higher realm. 3) The simultaneous exhaustion of the reproductive kammic energy and the expiration of the life-term ( ubhayakkhaya ). 4) The opposing action of a stronger kamma unexpectedly obstructing the fl ow of the reproductive kamma before the life- term expires ( upacchedaka-kamma ). Sudden untimely deaths of"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"561 persons and the deaths of children are due to this cause. A more powerful opposing force can check the path of a fl ying arrow and bring it down to the ground. So a very powerful kammic force of the past is capable of nullifying the potential energy of the last thought-process, and may thus destroy the psychic life of the being. The death of Venerable Devadatta, for instance, was due to a destructive kamma which he committed during his lifetime. The fi rst three are collectively called timely deaths ( kàla-marana ), and the fourth is known as untimely death ( akàlamarana ). An oil lamp, for instance, may get extinguished owing to any of the following four causes – namely, the exhaustion of the wick, the exhaustion of oil, simultaneous exhaustion of both wick and oil, or some extraneous cause like a gust of wind. So may death be due to any of the foregoing four causes. Very few people, indeed, are prepared to die. They want to live longer and longer, a delusion which contemporary research is mak- ing more possible to realize. The craving for more and more of this life is somewhat toned down, if one believes, as many do, that this is only one life of a series. Plenty more lives are available to those who crave for them and work begun in this one does not have to be fever- ishly rushed to a conclusion but may be taken up again in subsequent births. The actual pains of dying are, of course, various and not all people go through physical agonies. But there is distress of another sort; the frightful stresses which are set up in the mind of one whose body is dying – against his will. This is really the fi nal proof that the body does not belong to me, for if it did, I could do whatever I wanted with it; but at the time of death, although I desire continued life, it just goes and dies – and there is nothing to be done about it. If I go towards death unprepared, then, at the time when the body is dying, fearful insecurity will be experienced, the result of having wrongly identifi ed the body as myself."},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"130.

This is linked to the previous verse. After having exchanged blows over the incident at the Jetavana Monastery, the same t wo groups of monks quarrelled again over the same building. As the rule relating to physically hurting others had already been laid down by the Buddha, this particular rule was strictly observed by both groups. However, this time one of the two groups made threat- ening gestures to the other group, to the extent that the latter cried out in fright. The Buddha, after hearing about this threat- ening attitude of the monks, introduced the disciplinary rule preventing the making of threatening gestures to each other.

Here, the quality that is being inculcated is compassion. Disagreements and disputes arise due to lack of compassion. A universal compassion arises only when there is the perception of true reality. Compassion expresses itself through wholesome action. Compassion is not merely thinking compassionate thoughts. It has to show itself through compassionate action. Compassion is taking note of the sufferings of other beings in the world. It overcomes callous indifference to the plight of suffering beings, human or otherwise. Likewise, it must be refl ected in one’s life by a willingness to go out of one’s way to give aid where possible and to help those in distress. It has the advantage of reducing one’s selfi shness by understanding others’ sor- rows. It is Lord Buddha’s medicine for cruelty, for how can one harm oth- ers when one has seen how much they have to suffer already? It has also two enemies: the ‘near’ one is mere grief, while its ‘far’ enemy is cruelty. Mettà : compassion – loving-kindness. Mettà is the fi rst of the four sub- lime states. It means that which softens one’s heart, or the state of a true friend. It is defi ned as the sincere wish for the welfare and genuine hap- piness of all living beings without exception. It is also explained as the friendly disposition, for a genuine friend sincerely wishes for the welfare of his friend. “Just as a mother protects her only child even at the risk of her life, even so one should cultivate boundless loving-kindness towards all liv- ing beings” is the advice of the Buddha. It is not the passionate love of the mother towards her child that is stressed here but her sincere wish for the genuine welfare of her child. Mettà is neither carnal love nor personal affec- tion, for grief inevitably arises from both. Mettà is not mere neighbourli- ness, for it makes no distinction between neighbours and others. Mettà is not mere universal brotherhood, for it embraces all living beings includ- ing animals, our lesser brethren and sisters that need greater compassion as they are helpless. Mettà is not religious brotherhood either. Owing to the sad limitations of so-called religious brotherhood human heads have been severed without the least compunction, sincere outspoken men and women have been roasted and burnt alive; many atrocities have been per- petrated which baffl e description; cruel wars have been waged which mar the pages of world history. Even in this supposedly enlightened twentieth"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"565 century the followers of one religion hate or ruthlessly persecute and even kill those of other faiths merely because they cannot force them to think as they do or because they have a different label. If, on account of religious views, people of different faiths cannot meet on a common platform like brothers and sisters, then surely the missions of compassionate world teachers have pitifully failed. Sweet mettà transcends all these kinds of narrow brotherhood. It is limitless in scope and range. Barriers it has none. Discrimination it makes not. Mettà enables one to regard the whole world as one’s motherland and all as fellow-beings. Just as the sun sheds its rays on all without any distinction, even so sublime mettà bestows its sweet blessings equally on the pleasant and the unpleasant, on the rich and the poor, on the high and the low, on the vicious and the virtuous, on man and woman, and on human and animal. Such was the boundless mettà of the Buddha who worked for the welfare and happiness of those who loved Him as well as of those who hated Him and even attempted to harm and kill Him. The Buddha exercised mettà equally towards His own son Ràhula, His adversary Devadatta, His attendant ânanda, His admirers and His opponents. This loving-kindness should be extended in equal measure towards oneself as towards friend, foe and neutral alike. Suppose a bandit were to approach a person travelling through a forest with an intimate friend, a neutral person and an enemy, and suppose he were to demand that one of them be offered as a victim. If the traveller were to say that he himself should be taken, then he would have no mettà towards himself. If he were to say that anyone of the other three persons should be taken, then he would have no mettà towards them. Such is the characteristic of real mettà . In exercising this boundless loving-kindness oneself should not be ignored. This subtle point should not be misunderstood, for self-sacrifi ce is another sweet virtue and ego- lessness is yet another higher virtue. The culmination of this mettà is the identifi cation of oneself with all beings ( sabbattatà ), making no difference between oneself and others. The so-called I is lost in the whole. Separa- tism evaporates. Oneness is realized. There is no proper English equivalent for this graceful Pàli term mettà . Goodwill, loving-kindness, benevolence and universal love are suggested as the best renderings. The antithesis of mettà is anger, ill-will, hatred, or aversion. Mettà cannot co-exist with anger or vengeful conduct."},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"131. Sukhakàmàni bhåtàni yo daõóena vihiüsati attano sukhamesàno pecca so na labhate sukhaü.

On inquiry, to his indescrib- able joy, he understood that those arrangements were being made to entertain the Buddha on the following day.

His desire to visit the Buddha was so intense that he had a sleepless night and he arose at an unusual hour in the morning to start for the Sãtavana.

He thought of turning back. Then Sãvaka, a yakkha, himself invisible, encouraged him, saying: A hundred elephants and horses too, Ay, and a hundred chariots drawn by mules, A hundred thousand maidens, in their ears Bejewelled rings: – all are not worth The sixteenth fraction of a single stride.

Here the Buddha spent nineteen rainy seasons. This monastery where the Buddha spent the major part of His life was the place where He delivered many of His sermons. Several dis- courses, which were of particular interest to laymen, were delivered to Anàthapiõóika, although he refrained from asking any question from the Buddha, lest he should weary Him. Once, the Buddha, discoursing on generosity, reminded Anàthapiõóika that alms given to the Sangha together with the Buddha is very meritorious; but more meritorious than such alms is the build- ing of a monastery for the use of the Sangha; more meritorious than such monasteries is seeking refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha; more meritorious than seeking refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, is the observance of the fi ve precepts; more meritorious than such observance is meditation on loving-kindness ( mettà ) for a moment; and most meritorious of all is the development of Insight as to the fl eeting nature of things ( passanà ). On another occasion when the Buddha visited the house of Anàthapiõóika, he heard an unusual uproar inside the house and inquired what it was. “Lord, it is Sujàtà, my daughter-in-law, who lives with us. She is rich and has been brought here from a wealthy family.

Commenting on the four kinds of happiness a layman may enjoy, the Buddha declared: “There are these four kinds of happiness to be won by the householder who enjoys the pleasures of sense, from time to time and when occasion offers. They are: the happiness of ownership ( atthisukha ), the happiness of enjoyment ( bhog- asukha ), the happiness of debtlessness ( ananasukha ), and the happiness of innocence ( anavajjasukha ). “What is the happiness of ownership?” Herein a clansman has wealth acquired by energetic striving, amassed by strength of arm, won by sweat, lawful, and lawfully gotten. At the thought, wealth is mine, acquired by energetic striving, lawfully gotten, happiness comes to him, satisfaction comes to him. This is called the happiness of ownership. “What is the happiness of debtlessness?” Herein a clansman owes no debt, great or small, to anyone. At the thought, I owe no debt, great or small, to anyone, happiness comes to him, satisfaction comes to him. This is called the happiness of debtlessness. “What is the happiness of innocence? Herein the Aryan disciple is blessed with blameless action of body, blameless action of speech, blameless action of mind. At the thought, I am blessed with blameless action of body, speech and mind, happiness comes to him, satisfaction comes to him. This is called the happiness of innocence.” Winning the bliss of debtlessness a man May then recall the bliss of really having. When he enjoys the bliss of wealth, he sees ’Tis such by wisdom.

From the day Kunóadhàna became a monk a certain female form accompanied him. The Venerable himself never saw her, but everybody else saw her. Indeed, whenever the Venerable made an alms-round in a village, the inhabitants would fi rst give the Venerable a portion of alms saying, “Ven- erable, this is for you,” and then they would give the woman a second portion of alms, saying, “And this is for our female friend.” The story goes that in the dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa there were two companion-monks who were as inti- mately associated with each other as though they had issued from the womb of the same mother. And in the dispensation of the Buddha Dãghàyu, year by year and month by month as the monks met together for the purpose of keeping fast-day, those same two monks would come forth from their lodging and say to each other, “Let us go to the hall of discipline together.” Now at that time a certain goddess, reborn in the heav- enly world, seeing those two monks, thought, “These two monks are too much together; is there perhaps some way by which I can separate them?” No sooner had she thought this in her folly than one of the two monks said to his companion, “Brother, wait a moment; I must attend to the needs of nature.”"},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"576 As soon as she heard this, that goddess assumed the form of a woman and entered the thicket with the Venerable. When he came out, she followed close behind him, arranging with one hand her tuft of hair and with the other her undergarment. The Venerable himself could not see her, but when the monk who stood outside waiting for him turned and looked, he saw the woman come out, arranging her hair and her undergar- ment. As soon as the woman observed that the waiting monk had seen her, she disappeared. When the Venerable came up to the monk who was waiting for him, the latter said to him, “Brother, you have broken your vow of chastity.” “I have done no such thing, brother.” “Why, I just saw a young woman come out after you, doing this and that. Yet you say you have done nothing.” The Venerable acted as if he had been struck by a thunder- bolt. He said, “Brother, do not ruin me. I have done no such thing.” Said the monk, “What I saw, I saw with my own eyes. Do you expect me to believe you?” And forthwith he broke off the tip of his staff and departed. Moreover, when he sat down in the hall of concession, he said, “I will not keep the fast-day in his company.” The Venerable said to the monks, “Brethren, there is not a fl eck of dust even the size of an atom on my chastity.” But the monk repeated, “What I saw, I saw with my own eyes.” When the female spirit saw that the monk was unwilling to keep the fast-day with the Venerable, she thought to herself, “I have done a grievous wrong.” And straightaway she said to the monk, “Venerable, my noble elder has not really violated his vow of chastity. I did this merely to try him. Pray keep the fast-day with him as usual.” When the monk"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"577 saw the female spirit poised in the air, and heard her speak those words, he believed her, and kept the fast-day with the Venerable.

Now at the end of their allotted term of life, the Vener- ables were reborn according to their good pleasure. The female spirit was reborn in the Avãci Hell, and after suffering torment there for a period of an interval between two Buddhas, was reborn in Sàvatthi in the dispensation of the present Buddha as a man. When he had grown up he retired from the world and decided to become a monk, subsequently making it his full profession. From the day he retired from the world, a phantom in female form appeared and followed him. There- fore they gave him the name Kunóadhàna. When the monks observed that he was followed about by a woman, they said to Anàthapiõóika, “Treasurer, drive this unchaste monk out of your monastery, for by reason of him reproach will fall upon all of the other monks.” “But, Venerables, is the Buddha not at the monastery?” “He is, lay disciple.” ‘Well then, the Buddha alone will know.” The monks went and said the same thing to Visàkhà, and she gave them the same answer. The monks, getting no satisfaction from the two lay dis- ciples, reported the matter to the king, saying, “Great king, Kunóadhàna goes about accompanied by a woman, and has thus cast reproach upon all the rest of the monks.

When the Venerable observed that the king had come to his cell, he went up into the monastery again and sat down, but the king did not make obeisance to the Venerable. The king saw the woman no more. Although he looked inside the door and under the bed, still he did not see her. Finally he said to the monk, “Venerable, I saw a certain woman in this place; where is she?” “I see none, great king.” Then said the king, “I just saw her behind your back.” But the Venerable replied as before, “I see no woman, great king.” “Venerable, just step out here for a moment.” The monk came out and stood below, facing the monastery. Again that woman stood behind the Venerable. The king, seeing her, ascended once more to the upper fl oor. The Venerable observ- ing that the king had gone, sat down.

Her mother was Sumanà Devi, and her beloved grandfather was the rich man Mendaka. When she was only seven years old, the Buddha happened to visit her birth place, Bhaddiya, in the kingdom of Anga. Her grandfather, hear- ing of Buddha’s visit, said to her, “Dear girl, this is a happy day for you and a happy day for me. Summon the maidens who are your attendants, mount the chariots, and accompanied by your retinue of slave-maidens, go forth to welcome the Buddha.” Readily she agreed and, as advised, went up to the Buddha, saluted Him and sat respectfully at a side. The Buddha was pleased with her refi ned manners and he preached the Dhamma to her and others. Though young in age, she was comparatively far advanced from a moral standpoint. As such, immediately after hearing the Dhamma, she attained the fi rst stage of sainthood ( sotàpatti ) in her early age. Books state that even in the prime of her youth she possessed masculine strength and was gifted with all womanly charms. Her hair was like a peacock’s tail and when loosened it reached the hem of her skirt and then the ends of the hair curled and turned upwards. Her lips were of a bright red colour and were smooth and soft to the touch. Her teeth were white and were evenly set without inter-"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"585 stices and shone like a row of diamonds. Her skin, without the use of any cosmetic, was as smooth as a blue lotus-wreath and was of a golden colour. She retained her youthful appearance although she bore several children. Endowed with these fi ve kinds of feminine beauty – hair, fl esh, bone, skin and youth – young Visàkhà excelled both in worldly wisdom and spiritual insight. When she was about fi fteen or sixteen years old, on a certain festival day, she went on foot with her retinue in a holiday spirit to the river to bathe. Suddenly there arose an unexpected shower, and all but young Visàkhà ungraciously ran as fast as they could and entered a hall where there were some bràhmins who had come in search of a suit- able maiden possessed of the fi ve kinds of beauty for their young master. Cultured Visàkhà, without any particular haste, gracefully proceeded at her usual gait and entered the hall with garments and ornaments all wet. The inquisitive bràhmins criticized her for not quickening up her pace as others had done and thus escaping being drenched in the rain. Talented Visàkhà rose to the occasion and gave an extempore discourse on deportment according to her view. She said that she could have run even faster but she refrained from doing so purposely. Then she explained that it was not becoming for a king, adorned with all jewels, to gird up his loins and run in the palace-court. Likewise it is not becoming for a fully caparisoned state elephant to run; it should move about with the natural grace of an elephant. Monks also incur criticism when they run about like ordinary laymen. Likewise it is not a dignifi ed spectacle to see a woman running about like a man. The Bràhmins were pleased with her instructive talk and thought that she was an ideal wife for their master. Accordingly, arrangements were made to give her in marriage to their master, Punnavaddhàna, himself the son of a rich man named Migàra, who was not a follower of the Buddha. The marriage festival was conducted on an elaborate scale. On the wedding day, in addition to a large dowry and an exquisitely rich ornament ( mahàlatàpitandhàna ), her wise father gave her the following admonitions: (1) do not carry outside the indoor fi re; (2) do not take inside the outdoor fi re; (3) give only to those that give; (4) do not give to those that do not give; (5) give both to those that give and do not give; (6) sit happily; (7) eat happily; (8) sleep happily; (9) tend the fi re and (10) honour the household divinities. Books state that she had the good fortune to be the happy mother of ten fortunate sons and ten fortunate daughters. She died at the ripe age of one hundred and twenty."},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"136. Atha pàpàni kammàni karaü bàlo na bujjhati sehi kammehi dummedho aggidaóóho’va tappati.

Once upon a time Venerable Moggallàna was descend- ing from Vulture Peak with Venerable Lakkhana, when by Supernatural Vision he beheld a ghost twenty-fi ve leagues long in the form of a boa-constrictor. Flames of fi re proceeded from his head and descended on his extremities; fl ames of fi re proceeded from his extremities and descended on his head; fl ames of fi re proceeded from both sides of him and descended on his middle. When the Venerable beheld that ghost he smiled. When the Venerable Lakkhana asked him why he smiled, he replied, “Brother, it is not the proper time to answer that question; wait until we are in the presence of the Buddha, and then ask me.” When, therefore, Venerable Moggallàna had completed his round for alms in Ràjagaha, and had come into the pres- ence of the Buddha, Venerable Lakkhana repeated his ques- tion. Venerable Moggallàna replied as follows, “At that spot, brother, I saw a ghost, and his outward appearance was such and such. When I saw him, I thought to myself, ‘No such ghost as that did I ever see before.’ That is why I smiled.” Then said the Buddha, “Monks, my disciples indeed possess eyes and use them.” Continuing, he confi rmed the statement of the Venerable and added, “I saw that very ghost as I sat on the Throne of Enlightenment. However, the thought came into"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"588 my mind ‘If any refuse to believe my word, it may be to their detriment.’ Therefore I said nothing about it. But now that I have Moggallàna for my witness, I do say it.” When he had thus spoken, in response to a request of the monks, he explained what the ghost had done in a previous state of existence. The story goes that in the dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa, a treasurer named Sumangala spread the ground with bricks of gold for a space of twenty usabhas (fathoms), expended an equal amount of treasure in building a monas- tery, and an equal amount in giving a festival in honour of the opening of the monastery. One day, very early in the morning, as he was on his way to pay his respects to the Buddha, he saw hidden in a certain rest house at the gate of the city a certain thief, his feet spattered with mud, his robe drawn over his head. The treasurer said to himself, “This man with feet all spattered with mud must be some night- prowler in hiding.” “Never mind, I know how to get even with you,” thought the thief. And conceiving a grudge against the treasurer, he burned his fi eld seven times, cut off the feet of the cattle in his cattle-pen seven times, and burned his house seven times. But, in spite of all this, he was unable to satisfy his grudge against the treasurer. So he made friends with the treasurer’s page and asked him, “What is your master the treasurer especially fond of?” “There is nothing he thinks more of than the perfumed chamber,” replied the page. “Very well,” thought the thief, “I will burn up the perfumed cham- ber and thus satisfy my grudge.” Accordingly, when the"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"589 Buddha entered the city for alms he broke all the vessels used for drinking and eating and set fi re to the perfumed chamber. When the treasurer heard the cry, “The perfumed chamber is on fi re!” he immediately went there, but before he arrived at the perfumed chamber it had burned to the ground. The treasurer rebuilt the monastery and pardoned the thief for his crimes. The thief was reborn as the peta-ghost.

Once upon a time the heretics met together and said to each other, “Brethren, do you know the reason why the gifts and offerings to the Buddha have waxed great?” “No, we do not know; but do you know?” “Indeed we do know; it has all come about through one Venerable Moggallàna. For Venerable Moggallàna goes to heaven and asks the deities what deeds of merit they performed; and then he comes back to earth and says to men, ‘By doing this and that men receive such and such glory.’ Then he goes to hell and asks also those who have been reborn in hell what they did; and comes back to earth and says to men, ‘By doing this and that men experience such and such suffering.’ Men listen to what he says, and bring rich gifts and offerings. Now if we succeed in killing him, all these rich gifts and offerings will fall to us.” “That is a way indeed!” exclaimed all the heretics. So all the heretics with one accord formed the resolution, “We will kill him by hook or by crook.” Accordingly they roused their own supporters, procured a thousand pieces of money, and formed a plot to kill Venerable Moggallàna. Summoning some wandering thieves, they gave them the thousand pieces of"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"592 money and said to them, “Venerable Moggallàna lives at Black Rock. Go there and kill him.” The money attracted the thieves and they immediately agreed to do as they were asked. “Yes, indeed,” said the thieves; “we will kill the Venerable.” So they went and surrounded the Venerable’s place of abode. The Venerable, knowing that his place of abode was sur- rounded, slipped out through the keyhole and escaped. The thieves, not seeing the Venerable that day, came back on the following day, and again surrounded the Venerable’s place of abode. But the Venerable knew, and so he broke through the circular peak of the house and soared away into the air. Thus did the thieves attempt both in the fi rst month and in the sec- ond month to catch the Venerable, but without success. But when the third month came, the Venerable felt the compelling force of the evil deed he had himself committed in a previous state of existence, and made no attempt to get away. At last the thieves succeeded in catching the Venerable. When they had so done, they tore him limb from limb, and pounded his bones until they were as small as grains of rice. Then thinking to themselves, “He is dead,” they tossed his bones behind a certain clump of bushes and went their way. The Venerable thought to himself, “I will pay my respects to the Buddha before I pass into Nibbàna.” Accordingly he swathed himself with meditation as with a cloth, made him- self rigid, and soaring through the air, he proceeded to the Buddha, paid obeisance to the Buddha, and said to him, “Ven- erable, I am about to pass into Nibbàna.” “You are about to pass into Nibbàna, Moggallàna?” “Yes, Venerable.” “To what region of the earth are you going?” “To Black Rock, Venerable.” “Well then, Moggallàna, preach the Law to me before you go,"},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"593 for hereafter I shall have no such disciple as you to look upon.” “That will I do, Venerable,” replied Venerable Moggallàna. So fi rst paying obeisance to the Buddha, he rose into the air, per- formed all manner of miracles just as did the Venerable Sàriputta on the day when he passed into Nibbàna, preached the Dhamma, paid obeisance to the Buddha, and then went to Black Rock forest and passed into Nibbàna. Immediately the report spread all over South Asia. “Thieves have killed the Venerable.” Immediately King Ajàta- sattu sent out spies to search for the thieves. Now as those very thieves were drinking strong drink in a tavern, one of them struck the other on the back and felled him to the ground. Immediately the second thief reviled the fi rst, saying, “You scoundrel, why did you strike me on the back and fell me to the ground?” “Why, you vagabond of a thief, you were the fi rst to strike Venerable Moggallàna.” “You don’t know whether I struck him or not.” There was a babel of voices cry- ing out, “’Twas I struck him, ’Twas I struck him.” Those spies heard what the thieves said, captured all the thieves, and made their report to the king. The king caused the thieves to be brought into his presence and asked them, “Was it you that killed the Venerable?” “Yes, your majesty.” “Who, pray, put you up to it?” “The naked ascetics, your majesty,” The king had the fi ve hundred naked ascetics caught, placed them, together with the fi ve hundred thieves, waist-deep in pits which he had dug in the palace-court, caused their bodies to be covered over with bundles of straw, and then caused the bundles of straw to be lighted.

But as a matter of fact, the manner of death he met was in exact conformity with the deed he committed in a previous state of existence.” Thereupon the monks asked the Buddha, “But, venerable, what was the deed he committed in a previous state of exist- ence?” In reply the Buddha related his former deed in detail. The story goes that once upon a time in the distant past a certain youth of good family performed with his own hand all of the household duties, such as pounding rice and cook- ing, and took care of his mother and father also. One day his mother and father said to him, “Son, you are wearing yourself out by performing all of the work both in the house and in the forest. We will fetch you home a certain young woman to be your wife.” The son replied, “Dear mother and father, there is no necessity of your doing anything of the sort. So long as you both shall live I will wait upon you with my own hand.” In spite of the fact that he refused to listen to their suggestion, they repeated their request time and again, and fi nally brought him home a young woman to be his wife. For a few days only she waited upon his mother and father. After those few days had passed, she was unable even to bear the sight of them and said to her husband with a great show of indignation, “It is impossible for me to live any longer in the same house with your mother and father.” But he paid"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"596 no attention to what she said. So one day, when he was out of the house, she took bits of clay and bark and scum of rice- gruel and scattered them here and there about the house. When her husband returned and asked her what it meant, she said, “This is what your blind old parents have done; they go about littering up the entire house; it is impossible for me to live in the same place with them any longer.” Thus did she speak again and again. The result was that fi nally even a being so distinguished as he, a being who had fulfi lled the Perfection, broke with his mother and father. “Never mind,” said the husband, I shall fi nd some way of dealing with them properly.” So when he had given them food, he said to them, “Dear mother and father, in such and such a place live kinsfolk of yours who desire you to visit them; let us go thither.” And assisting them to enter a carriage, he set out with them. When he reached the depths of the for- est, he said to his father, “Dear father, hold these reins; the oxen know the track so well that they will go without guid- ance; this is a place where thieves lie in wait for travellers; I am going to descend from the carriage.” And giving the reins into the hands of his father, he descended from the carriage and made his way into the forest. As he did so, he began to make a noise, increasing the volume of the noise until it sounded as if a band of thieves were about to make an attack. When his mother and father heard the noise, they thought to themselves, “A band of thieves are about to attack us.” Therefore they said to their son, “Son, we are old people; save yourself, and pay no atten- tion to us.” But even as his mother and father cried out thus, the son, yelling the thieves’ yell, beat them and killed them"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"597 and threw their bodies into the forest. Having so done, he returned home. When the Buddha had related the foregoing story of Venerable Moggallàna’s misdeed in a previous state of exist- ence, he said, “Monks, by reason of the fact that Venerable Moggallàna committed so monstrous a sin, he suffered tor- ment for numberless hundreds of thousands of years in hell; and thereafter, because the fruit of his evil deed was not yet exhausted, in a hundred successive existences he was beaten and pounded to pieces in like manner and so met death. Therefore the manner of death which Venerable Moggallàna suffered was in exact conformity with his own misdeed in a previous state of existence. Likewise the fi ve hundred heretics who with the fi ve hundred thieves offended against my son who had committed no offense against them, suffered pre- cisely that form of death which they deserved.

If Sàriputta could be regarded as the Chief Disciple on the right of Buddha, Moggallàna was the Chief Disciple on His left. They were born on the same day and were associated with each other during many previous lives; so were they dur- ing the last life. It is one of the oldest recorded friendships in the world. Venerable Moggallàna was foremost in the noble Sangha in psychic power. Once a king of cobras called Nandopananda, also noted for psychic feats, was threatening the Buddha and some arahats. The Buddha was besieged with offers from various members of the noble sangha to subdue the snake king. At last Venerable Moggallàna’s turn came and the Buddha readily assented. He knew he was equal to the task The result was a psychic con- frontation with the Naga King who was worsted and he begged for peace. The Buddha was present throughout the encounter. This epic feat is commemorated in the seventh verse of the Jayaman- gala Gàthà which is recited at almost every Buddhist function. Whether in shaking the marble palace of Sakka, the heavenly ruler, with his great toe, or visiting hell, he was equally at ease. These visits enabled him to be a sort of an information bureau. He could graphically narrate, to dwellers of this earth, the fate of their erstwhile friends or relatives. How, by evil Kamma, some get an ignominious rebirth in hell, and others, by good Kamma, an auspicious rebirth in one of the six heavens. These ministra- tions brought great fame to the dispensation, much to the chagrin of other sects. His life is an example and a grim warning. Even a chief disciple, cap- able of such heroic feats, was not immune from the residue of evil kamma sown in the very remote past. It was a heinous crime. He had committed matricide and patricide under the most revolting circumstances. Many rebirths in hell could not adequately erase the evil effects of the dire deed. Long ago, to oblige his young wife, whose one obsession was to get rid of her parents-in-law, he took his aged parents to a forest, as if going on a journey, waylaid and clubbed them to death, amidst cries of the parents imploring the son to escape from the robbers, who they imagined were clubbing them. In the face of such cruelty, the love of his parents was most touching. In the last life of Moggallàna, he could not escape the relentless force of kamma. For, with an arahat’s parinibbàna , good or bad effects of kamma come to an end. He was trapped twice by robbers but he made"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"140.

But, on the third occasion, he saw with his divine eye, the futility of escape. He was mercilessly beaten, so much so that his body could be put even in a sack. But death must await his destiny. It is written that a chief disciple must not only predecease the Buddha, but also had to treat the Buddha before his death ( parinibbàna ), and perform miraculous feats and speak verses in farewell, and the Buddha had to enumerate his virtues in return. He was no exception. The curtain came down closing a celebrated career. The noble Sangha was bereft of the most dynamic fi gure. Chief Disciple Moggallàna’s life story is intimately linked with that of co-Chief Disciple Sàriputta. Not far from Ràjagaha, in the village Upatissa, also known as Nàlaka, there lived a very intelligent youth named Sàriputta. Since he belonged to the leading family of the village, he was also called Upatissa. Though nurtured in Bràhmanism, his broad outlook on life and matured wisdom compelled him to renounce his ancestral religion for the more tolerant and scientifi c teachings of the Buddha Gotama. His brothers and sisters fol- lowed his noble example. His father, Vanganta, apparently adhered to the Bràhmin faith. His mother, who was displeased with the son for having become a Buddhist, was converted to Buddhism by himself at the moment of his death. Upatissa was brought up in the lap of luxury. He found a very intimate friend in Kolita, also known as Moggallàna, with whom he was closely associated from a remote past. One day, as both of them were enjoy- ing a hill-top festival, they realized how vain, how transient, were all sen- sual pleasures. Instantly they decided to leave the world and seek the path of release. They wandered from place to place in quest of peace. The two young seekers went at fi rst to Sanjaya, who had a large fol- lowing, and sought ordination under him. Before long, they acquired the meager knowledge which their master imparted to them, but dissatisfi ed with his teachings, as they could not fi nd a remedy for that universal ail- ment with which humanity is assailed – they left him and wandered hither and thither in search of peace. They approached many a famous bràhmin and ascetic, but disappointment met them everywhere. Ultimately, they returned to their own village and agreed amongst themselves that, who- ever would fi rst discover the Path should inform the other. It was at that time that the Buddha dispatched His fi rst sixty disci- ples to proclaim the sublime Dhamma to the world. The Buddha Himself"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"603 proceeded towards Uruvela, and the Venerable Assajã, one of the fi rst fi ve disciples, went in the direction of Ràjagaha. The good kamma of the seekers now intervened, as if watching with sympathetic eyes their spiritual progress. For Upatissa, while wan- dering in the city of Ràjagaha, casually met an ascetic whose venerable appearance and saintly deportment at once arrested his attention. This ascetic’s eyes were lowly fi xed a yoke’s distance from him, and his calm face showed deep peace within him. With body well composed, robes neatly arranged, this venerable fi gure passed with measured steps from door to door, accepting the morsels of food which the charitable placed in his bowl. “Never before have I seen,” he thought to himself, “an ascetic like this. Surely, he must be one of those who have attained arahatship, or one who is practicing the path leading to arahatship. How if I were to approach him and question, ‘For whose sake, Sire, have you retired from the world? Who is your teacher? Whose doctrine do you profess?’” Upatissa, however, refrained from questioning him, as he thought he would thereby interfere with his silent begging tour. The Arahat Assajã, having obtained what little he needed, was seeking a suitable place to eat his meal. Upatissa seeing this, gladly availed himself of the opportunity to offer him his own stool and water from his own pot. Fulfi lling thus the pre- liminary duties of a pupil, he exchanged pleasant greetings with him, and reverently inquired, “Venerable, calm and serene are your organs of sense, clean and clear is the hue of your skin. For whose sake have you retired from the world? Who is your teacher? Whose doctrine do you profess?” The unassuming Arahat Assajã modestly replied, as is the characteristic of all great men, “I am still young in the sangha, brother, and I am not able to expound the Dhamma to you at length.” “I am Upatissa, Venerable. Say much or little according to your abil- ity, and it is left to me to understand it in a hundred or thousand ways.” “Say little or much,” Upatissa continued, “tell me just the substance. The substance only do I require. A mere jumble of words is of no avail.” The Venerable Assajã spoke a four line stanza, thus skillfully sum- ming up the profound philosophy of the Master, on the truth of the law of cause and effect.

So well did the Venerable Assajã guided him on his upward path that immediately on hearing the fi rst two lines, he attained the fi rst stage of sainthood, sotàpatti . The new convert Upatissa must have been, no doubt, destitute of words to thank to his heart’s content his Venerable teacher for introducing him to the sublime teachings of the Buddha. He expressed his deep indebtedness for his brilliant exposi- tion of the truth, and obtaining from him the necessary particulars with regard to the master, took his leave. Later, the devotion showed towards his teacher was such that since he heard the Dhamma from the Vener- able Assajã, in whatever quarter he heard that his teacher was residing, in that direction he would extend his clasped hands in an attitude of rever- ent obeisance and in that direction he would turn his head when he lay down to sleep. Now, in accordance with the agreement he returned to his compan- ion Kolita to convey the joyful tidings. Kolita, who was as enlightened as his friend, also attained the fi rst stage of Sainthood on hearing the whole stanza. Overwhelmed with joy at their successful search after peace, as in duty bound, they went to meet their teacher Sanjaya with the object of converting him to the new doctrine. Frustrated in their attempt Upatissa and Ko1ita, accompanied by many followers of Sanjaya who readily joined them, repaired to the Ve1uvana Monastery to visit their illustrious Teacher, the Buddha. In compliance with their request, the Buddha admitted both of them into the sangha by the mere utterance of the words – Etha Bhikkhave ! (Come, O Monks!). A fortnight later, the Venerable Sàriputta attained arahatship on hearing the Buddha expound the Ve d a n à Pariggaha Sutta to the wander- ing ascetic Dãghanakha .

Once there was a rich man in Sàvatthi. After the death of his wife, he decided to become a monk. But before he entered the sangha, he built a monastery, which included a kitchen and a store room. He also brought his own furniture, utensils and a large stock of rice, oil, butter and other provi- sions. Whatever dishes he wanted were cooked for him by his servants. Thus, even as a monk he was living in comfort, and because he had so many things with him, he was known as Bahåbhànóika. One day, other monks took him to the Buddha, and in his presence told the Buddha about the many things he had brought along with him to the monastery, and also how he was still leading the luxurious life of a rich man. So, the Buddha said to Bahåbhànóika, “My son, I have been teaching all of you to live an austere life; why have you brought so much property with you?” When reprimanded even this much, that monk lost his temper and said angrily, “Indeed, venerable! I will now live as you wish me to.” So say- ing, he cast off his upper robe. Seeing him thus, the Buddha said to him, “My son, in your last existence you were an evil spirit; even as an evil spirit you had a sense of shame and a sense of fear to do evil.

The Buddha denounces strict asceticism confi ned to such externals. The members of His celibate sangha follow the middle path, avoiding the extremes of self-mortifi cation and self-indulgence. Simplicity, humility, and poverty should be the chief characteristics of monks as much as clean- liness. Unwashed matted hair is regarded by the foolish as a mark of holiness. The non-cleaning of teeth and smearing the body with mud and fasting alone do not tend to purifi cation. The monks too fast daily between midday and the following dawn. Sleeping on the ground does not lead to purity. Monks only avoid luxurious and high couches. Rubbing the body with ashes is still practiced by some ascetics. Superfi cial observances and vows do not purify a person, no matter how long it is practiced. As long as the mind wavers between good and bad (and has not achieved integrity where the mind is set on being good without hesitation), purity of mind has not been achieved.

King Pasenadi was so pleased with him that he honoured the minister with the gift of the riches and glory of a ruler together with a dancing girl to entertain him for seven days. On the seventh day, riding the ornamented royal elephant, he went down to the riverside for a bath.

Please help me get over my sorrow; be my refuge, and let me have the peace of mind.” To him the Buddha replied, “Rest assured my son, you have come to One who could help you, One who could be a constant solace to you and who will be your refuge. The tears you have shed due to the death of this dancer throughout the round of rebirths is more than the waters of all the oceans.” The Buddha then instructed the minister in verse. The meaning of the verse is as follows: In the past there has been in you clinging ( upàdàna ) due to craving; get rid of it. In future, do not let such clinging occur in you. Do not also harbour any clinging in the present; by not having any cling- ing, craving and passion will be calmed in you and you will realize Nibbàna.” After hearing the verse, the minister attained arahat- ship. Then, realizing that his life span was at an end, he said to the Buddha, “Venerable! Let me now realize parinibbàna (great demise), for my time has come.” The Buddha consent- ing, Santati rose to a height of seven toddy-palms into the sky and there, while meditating on the element of fi re ( tejo kasina ), he passed away realizing parinibbàna.

Then, he stopped going to the tree. Other monks, noticing that Pilotikatissa had stopped going to the tree where he kept his old clothes and his plate, asked him, “Why don’t you go to your teacher any more?” To them, he answered, ‘When I had the need, I had to go to him; but there is no need for me to go to him now.” When the monks heard his reply, they took him to see the Buddha. When they came to his pres- ence they said, “Venerable! This monk claims that he has attained arahatship; he must be telling lies.” But the Buddha refuted them, and said, “Monks! Pilotikatissa is not telling lies, he speaks the truth. Though he had relationship with his teacher previously, now he has no relationship whatsoever with his teacher.

(3) A pupil should minister to a teacher by: (i) rising, (ii) attending on him, (iii) attentive hearing, (iv) personal service, and (v) respectfully receiving instructions. (4) Teachers thus ministered to by pupils should: (i) train them in the best discipline, (ii) make them receive that which is well held by them, (iii) teach them every suitable art and science, (iv) introduce them to their friends and associates, and (v) provide for their safety in every quarter. (5) A husband should minister to his wife by: (i) courtesy, (ii) not despising her, (iii) faithfulness, (iv) handing over authority to her, and (v) providing her with ornaments. (6) The wife, who is thus ministered to by her husband, should: (i) perform her duties in perfect order, (ii) be hospitable to the people around, (iii) be faithful, (iv) protect what he brings, and (v) be industrious and not lazy in discharging her duties."},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"619 (7) A noble scion should minister to his friends and associates by: (i) generosity, (ii) courteous speech, (iii) promoting their good, (iv) equality, and (v) truthfulness.

(9) A master should minister to servants and employees by: (i) assigning them work according to their strength, (ii) supplying them with food and wages, (iii) tending them in sickness, (iv) sharing with them extraordinary delicacies, and (v) relieving them at times. (10) The servants and employees, who are thus ministered to by their master, should: (i) rise before him, (ii) go to sleep after him, (iii) take only what is given, (iv) perform their duties satisfactorily, and (v) spread his good name and fame. (11) A noble scion should minister to ascetics and bràhmins by: (i) lovable deeds, (ii) lovable words, (iii) lovable thoughts, (iv) not closing the doors against them, and (v) supplying their material needs.

He considers it his duty to be a blessing to himself and others, and not a curse to any, whether man or animal. As life is precious to all and as no man has the right to take away the life of another, he extends his compassion and loving- kindness towards every living being, even to the tiniest creature that crawls at his feet, and refrains from killing or causing injury to any living creature. It is the animal instinct in man that prompts him mercilessly to kill the weak and feast on their fl esh. Whether to appease one’s appetite or as a pastime it is not justifi able to kill or cause a helpless animal to be killed by any method whether cruel or humane. And if it is wrong to kill an animal, what must be said of slaying human beings, however noble the motive may at fi rst sight appear. Furthermore, a Bodhisatta abstains from all forms of stealing, direct or indirect, and thus develops honesty, trustworthiness and uprightness. Abstaining from misconduct, which debases the exalted nature of man, he tries to be pure and chaste in his sex life. He avoids false speech, harsh language, slander, and frivolous talk and utters only words which are true, sweet, peaceable and helpful. He avoids intoxicating liquors which tend to mental distraction and confusion, and cultivates heedfulness and clarity of vision. A bodhisatta would adhere to these fi ve principles which tend to control deeds and words, whether against his own interests or not. On a proper occasion he will sacrifi ce not only possessions and wealth but life itself for the sake of his principles. It should not be understood that a Bodhisatta is perfect in his dealings in the course of his wan- derings in saüsàra. Being a worldling, he possesses his own failings and limitations. Certain jàtakas , like the Kànavera Jàtaka, depict him as a very desperate highway robber. This, however, is the exception rather than the rule.

Then the Buddha addressed the Venerable, saying, “Go, Sàriputta, give the novice his food.” The elder monk went and forced the door, whereupon the novice came out and paid his respects to the Venerable. “Eat the food I have brought you,” said the Ve n e r a bl e. Just then the Buddha approached and asked, “Monks, what is it that you are sitting here talking about now?” The monks replied, “Venerable, today the morning seemed very long, and the evening was tardy.

Once, there lived in Ràjagaha, a very beautiful courtesan by the name of Sirimà. Every day Sirimà offered alms-food to eight monks. One of these monks happened to mention to other monks how beautiful Sirimà was and also that she offered very delicious food to the monks every day. On hear- ing this, a young monk fell in love with Sirimà even without seeing her. The next day, the young monk went with the other monks to the house of Sirimà. Sirimà was not well on that day, but since she wanted to pay obeisance to the monks, she was carried to the presence of the monks. The young monk, seeing Sirimà, thought to himself, “Even though she is sick, she is very beautiful!” And he felt a strong desire for her. That very night, Sirimà died. King Bimbisàra went to the Buddha and reported to him that “Sirimà, the sister of Jãvaka, had died. The Buddha told King Bimbisàra to take the dead body to the cemetery and keep it there for three days without burying it, but to have it protected from crows and vultures. The king did as he was told. On the fourth day, the dead body of the beautiful Sirimà was no longer beautiful or desirable; it got bloated and maggots came out of the nine orifi ces.

The young monk, who was so desperately in love with Sirimà, did not know that Sirimà had died. When he learnt that the Buddha and the monks were going to see Sir- imà, he joined them. At the cemetery, the corpse of Sirimà was surrounded by the monks headed by the Buddha, and also by the king and his men. The Buddha, surrounded by the congregation of monks, stood on one side of the corpse; the congregation of nuns and the king’s retinue and the company of lay disciples, both male and female, stood on the other side of the corpse, each com- pany in its proper place. The Buddha then asked the king, “Great king, who is this woman?” “Venerable, it is Jãvaka’s sister Sirimà.” “Is this Sirimà?” “Yes, Venerable.” “Well! Send a drum through the town and make proclamation, ‘Those who will pay a thousand pieces of money for Sirimà may have her.’” Not a man said ‘hem’ or ‘hum’. The king brought down the price to a penny, then to a half-penny, then to a quarter of a penny, then to an eighth of a penny. At last he proclaimed to the beating of a drum, “They may have her for nothing.” Not a man said ‘hem’ or ‘hum’. Then said the king to the Buddha, “Venerable, no one will take her, even as a gift.” The Buddha replied, “Monks, you see the value of a woman in the eyes of the multitude. In this very city men used to pay a thousand pieces of money for the privilege of spending one night with this woman. Now there is no one who will take her as a gift.

The same thing happened on the next two days. Thus Nun Uttarà was without food for three successive days and she was feeling weak. On the fourth day, while she was on her alms-round, she met the Buddha on the road where it was narrow. Respect- fully, she paid obeisance to the Buddha and stepped back. While doing so, she accidentally stepped on her own robe and fell on the ground, injuring her head.

Commentary jãvitaü maraõantaü : life ends in death. The central purpose of this stanza is to drive home the fact of impermanence of life. Imperma- nence ( aniccà ) is the fi rst of three characteristics of existence ( tilakkhana ). It is from the fact of impermanence that, in most texts, the other two characteristics, suffering ( dukkha ) and not-self ( anattà ), are derived. Impermanence of things is the rising, passing and changing of things, or the disappearance of things that have become or arisen. The mean- ing is that these things never persist in the same way, but that they are vanishing and dissolving from moment to moment. Impermanence is a basic feature of all conditioned phenomena, be they material or mental, coarse or subtle, one’s own or external. All formations are impermanent. That the totality of existence is imper- manent is also often stated in terms of the fi ve aggregates, the twelve sense bases. Only Nibbàna which is unconditioned and not a forma- tion ( asankata ), is permanent. The insight leading to the fi rst stage of deliverance, stream-entry, is often expressed in terms of impermanence: “Whatever is subject to origination, is subject to cessation.” In his last exhortation, before his Parinibbàna, the Buddha reminded his monks of the impermanence"},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"637 of existence as a spur to earnest effort: “Behold now, monks, I exhort you. Formations are bound to vanish. Strive earnestly!” Without deep insight into the impermanence and unsubstantial- ity of all phenomena of existence there is no attainment of deliverance. Hence comprehension of impermanence gained by direct meditative experience, heads two lists of insight knowledge: (a) contemplation of impermanence is the fi rst of the eighteen chief kinds of insight; (b) the contemplation of arising and vanishing is the fi rst of nine kinds of knowledge which lead to the purifi cation by knowledge and vision of the path congress. Contemplation of impermanence leads to the conditionless deliverance. As herein the faculty of confi dence is outstanding, he who attains in that way the path of stream-entry, is called a faith-devotee and at the seven higher stages he is called faith- liberated. pabhaõguraü : the body is likely to disintegrate easily. påtisandeho : putrid matter oozes out of its nine orifi ces. aniccà : impermanence. Regarding impermanence, though we may see leaves on a tree, some young and unfolding, some mature, while others are sere and yellow, impermanence does not strike home in our hearts. Although our hair changes from black, to grey, to white over the years, we do not realize what is so obviously being preached by this change – impermanence. There is a vast difference between occasionally acquiescing in the mind or admitting with the tongue the truth of impermanence, and actually realizing it constantly in the heart. The trouble is that while intellectually we may accept imper- manence as valid truth, emotionally we do not admit it, specially in regard to I and mine. But whatever our unskillful emotions of greed may or may not admit, impermanence remains a truth, and the sooner we come to realize through insight that it is a truth, the hap- pier we shall be, because our mode of thought will thus be nearer to reality."},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":"149.

A great number of monks, after taking a subject of meditation from the Buddha, went into the woods. There, they practiced meditation ardently and diligently and soon attained deep mental absorption ( jhàna ) and they thought that they were free from sensual desires and, therefore, had attained arahatship. Actually, they were only over-estimating themselves. Then, they went to the Buddha, with the inten- tion of informing the Buddha about what they thought was their attainment of arahatship. When they arrived at the outer gate of the Monastery, the Buddha said to the Venerable ânanda, “Those monks will not benefi t much by coming to see me now; let them go to the cemetery fi rst and come to see me only afterwards.” The Ven- erable ânanda then delivered the message of the Buddha to those monks, and they refl ected, “The Buddha knows every- thing; he must have some reason in making us go to the cem- etery fi rst.” So they went to the cemetery. There, when they saw the putrid corpses they could look at them as just skeletons, and bones, but when they saw some fresh dead bodies they realized, with horror, that they still had some sensual desires awakening in them.

The only way to fi nd happiness is to learn to control the emotions and calm the mind, by changing the way we think. We have to become detached from things and independent emotionally. This is done by understanding that we do not own anything in the world, including what we call ourselves: the body, mind, and spirit."},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"150.

Princess Janapadakalyàni was the daughter-in-law of Gotami, the step-mother of Gotama the Buddha; because she was very beautiful she was also known as Råpanandà. She was married to Nanda, half brother of the Buddha. One day she pondered, “My elder brother who could have become a Universal Monarch has renounced the world to become a monk; he is now a Buddha. Ràhula, the son of my elder brother, and my own husband Prince Nanda have also become monks. My mother Gotami has also become a nun, and I am all alone here!” So saying, she went to the monastery of some nuns and became a nun herself. Thus, she had become a nun not out of faith but only in imitation of others and because she felt lonely. Råpanandà had heard from others that the Buddha often taught impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and insub- stantiality of the khandhas (component things). So she thought he would talk deprecatingly about her good looks if he should see her; and thus thinking, she kept away from the Buddha. But other nuns, coming back from the monastery, kept talking in praise of the Buddha; so, one day, she decided to accom- pany other nuns to the monastery."},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"644 The Buddha saw her and refl ected, “A thorn can only be taken out with a thorn; Råpanandà being very attached to her body and being very proud of her beauty, I must take the pride and attachment out of her through beauty.” So, with his supernormal power, he caused an image of a very beautiful lady of about sixteen years of age to be seated near him, fan- ning him. This young girl was visible only to Råpanandà and the Buddha. When Råpanandà saw the girl, she realized that compared to that girl, she herself was just like an old, ugly crow compared to a beautiful white swan. Råpanandà had a good look at the girl and she felt that she liked her very much. Then, she looked again and was surprised to fi nd that the girl had grown to the age of about twenty. Again and again, she looked at the fi gure beside the Buddha and every time she noticed that the girl had grown older and older. Thus, the girl turned into a grown-up lady, then into a middle-aged lady, and a very old lady, successively. Råpanandà also noticed that with the arising of a new image, the old image disappeared, and she came to realize that there was a continuous process of change and decay in the body. With the coming of this realization, her attachment to the body diminished. Mean- while, the fi gure near the Buddha had turned into an old, decrepit lady, who could no longer control her bodily func- tions, and was rolling in her own excreta. Finally, she died, her body got bloated, pus and maggots came out of the nine openings and crows and vultures were trying to snatch at the dead body.

Her pet dog came in; as she was bend- ing to wash her feet, the dog tried to have sex with her, and the queen appeared to be amused and somewhat pleased. The king saw this strange incident through the window from his bedroom. When the queen came in, he said angrily to the queen, “Oh, you wicked woman! What were you doing with that dog in the bathroom? Do not deny what I saw with my own eyes.” The queen replied that she was only washing her face, her hands and her feet, and so was doing nothing wrong. Then she continued, “But, that room is very strange. If any- one went into that room, to one looking from this window there would appear to be as two. If you do not believe me, O king, please go into that room and I will look through this window.” So, the king went into the bathroom.

As a result of this, when she died she was reborn in Niraya (hell). After her burial, the king intended to ask the Buddha where she was reborn. The Buddha wished to spare his feelings, and also did not want him to lose faith in the Dhamma. So he willed that this question should not be put to him and King Pasenadi forgot to ask the Buddha. However, after seven days in niraya, the queen was reborn in the Tusita deva world. On that day, the Buddha went to King Pasenadi’s palace for alms-food; he indicated that he wished to rest in the coach-shed where the royal car- riages were kept.

She was always thinking of doing good deeds, always thinking what to offer to the Buddha on the next day. Venerable! Now that she is gone, I, your humble disciple, hardly know what to do.” To him the Buddha said, “Look at these carriages of your father and your grandfather; these are all worn down and lying useless; so also is your body, which is subject to death and decay.

At dawn, on the very day of His Enlightenment, the Buddha spoke this paean of joy ( Udàna ) which vividly describes His transcendental moral victory and His inner spiritual experience. He was compelled to travel on this tour ( saüsàra ) and consequently to suf- fer, as He could not discover the architect that built this house and the self. In His fi nal birth, while engaged in solitary meditation, which He had highly developed, in the course of His wanderings, after a relentless search He discovered, by His own insight, the elusive archi- tect residing, not outside, but within the recesses of His own heart. It was the mental process of perception and conception ( sankhàra ) and the compulsive urge to exist ( bhava tanhà ) that was the creator, the architect, the builder, which is a mental process latent in all.

The discovery of the architect is the introspective awareness of the mental process, which stopped the process, attaining arahatship. In these verses it is alluded to as ‘the cessation of the urge’. The support of this self-created house is the urge. The structure is the mental construct ( sankhàra ). The shattering of the structure by becoming conscious of the process results in the complete demolition of the house. With the demolition of the house the mind attains the uncon- ditioned state, which is Nibbàna. Here, the Buddha admits his past wanderings in existence which entail suffering, a fact which evidently proves that rebirth, more than being a mere belief, is the very factual basis of the practice of Buddhism. It is the problem that the Buddha set out to solve for the benefi t of all mankind. tanhànaü khayaü ajjhagà : literally attained the cessation of the craving which is Nibbàna the deathless. Nibbàna is the summum bonum of Buddhism. The Jàtaka Commentary relates that the Bodhisatta, in his birth as the ascetic Sumedha, contemplated thus: “Even as, although Misery is, Yet Happiness is also found, So, though indeed Existence is, Non-existence should be sought. “Even as, although there may be Heat, Yet grateful Cold is also found, So, though the three-fold Fire exists, Likewise Nirvàna should be sought. “Even as, although there Evil is, That which is Good is also found, So, though ‘tis true that birth exists. That which is not birth should be sought.” The pàli word Nibbàna (Sanskrit – Nirvàna ) is composed of ‘ N ’ and ‘ Vàna ’. N is a negative particle. Vàna means motion. “It is called"},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"659 Nibbàna in that it is the absence ( Ni ) of that compulsive urge to move, which is the reaction of an organism to stimulation which is called Vàna .” As long as one is impelled by the urge, one accumulates fresh Kammic activities which must continue in one form or other the perpetual cycle of birth and death. When all forms of this urge are eradicated, reproductive kammic forces cease to operate, and one attains Nibbàna, stopping the cycle of birth and death. The Buddhist conception of deliverance is stopping the ever-recurring cycle of life and death. Nibbàna is also explained as the extinction of the fetters of lust ( lobha ), hatred ( dosa ), and delusion ( moha ). “The whole world is in fl ames,” says the Buddha. “By what fi re is it kindled? By the fi re of lust, hatred and delusion; by the fi re of birth, old age, death, sorrow, lam- entation, pain, grief and despair is it kindled.” Nibbàna, in one sense may be interpreted as the extinction of these fl ames. Nibbàna is noth- ing but the extinction of these fl ames. The extinction of the fl ames is not the means of attaining Nibbàna, it is the end itself. Some writers hesitate to say that Nibbàna is nothingness. They forget the all important concept of ‘nothingness’ ( su¤¤atà ) in Buddhism. They always crave for something even in Nibbàna. But unless we ‘desire nothing’ we cannot attain Nibbàna. If Nibbàna is nothingness, then it must be analogous to space ( âkàsa ). Both space and Nibbàna are eter- nal and unchanging. The former is eternal because it is the absence of matter. The latter is both spaceless and timeless. It is incorrect to say that space or Nibbàna ‘is not’. It may briefl y be said that space ‘is’ in relation to matter; and Nibbàna ‘is’ in relation to suffering. The Buddha, speaking of the different planes of existence, makes special reference to a ‘Realm of Nothingness’ ( âki¤ca¤¤àyatana ), which must be distinguished from Nibbàna. The realm of nothing- ness is not an absence but a perception of nothingness. In this image Buddha describes the self as a house built by a house-builder. The house-builder, identifi es in these verses in craving ( taõhà ). The reason for such an identifi cation is that in the system of Buddha’s right. The factor that brings about repeated birth in the cycle of existence in craving."},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"155.

And they said, “Live for a hundred years, master, treasurer’s son! With your help may we be ena- bled to eat and drink to our heart’s content!” Hearing the words, the youth asked the little page who followed him, “What are these men drinking?” “A certain drink, master.” “Does it taste good?” “Master, in this world of the living there is no kind of drink that can be compared with this.” “In that case,” said the youth, I must have some too.” So he caused the page to bring him fi rst a little and then a little more, and all this he drank. Now before long those knaves discovered that he had taken up the habit of drinking. Then they fl ocked around him. As time went on, the crowd that surrounded him increased in numbers. He would spend a hundred or two hundred pieces of money at a time on strong drink. It became a habit with him after a time, wherever he happened to be, to pile up a heap of coins and call out as he drank, “Take this coin and fetch me fl owers! Take this coin and fetch me perfumes!

All that belonged to him, he sold, and the proceeds he spent in riotous living. In old age he sold his house, the property of his family. And those to whom he sold his house took possession of it and straightaway put him out. Thereupon, taking his wife with him, he found lodging near the house-wall of other peo- ple’s houses. With a broken pot in his hand, he would go about begging alms. Finally he began to eat the left-overs of other people’s food. One day he stood at the door of a rest-house, receiving left-overs of food presented to him by novices and probation- ers. The Buddha saw him and smiled.

Once, Prince Bodhi built a magnifi cent palace for him- self. When the palace was fi nished he invited the Buddha for alms-food. For this special occasion, he had the building deco- rated and perfumed with four kinds of scents and incense. Also, a long length of cloth was spread on the fl oor, starting from the threshold to the interior of the room. Then, because he had no children, the prince made a solemn asseveration that if he were to have any children the Buddha should step on the cloth. When the Buddha came, Prince Bodhi respect- fully requested the Buddha three times to enter the room. But the Buddha, instead of moving, only looked at ânanda. ânanda understood him and so asked Prince Bodhi to remove the cloth from the door-step. Then only, the Buddha entered the palace. The prince then offered delicious and choice food to the Buddha. After the meal, the prince asked the Buddha why he did not step on the cloth. The Buddha in turn asked the prince whether he had not spread the cloth making a sol- emn asseveration that if he were to be blessed with a child, the Buddha would step on it; and the prince replied in the affi rmative.

The difference of Buddhism from other religious systems is quite essential and to be appreciated."},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"672 Rhys Davids asked the question: “What is meant by religion?” Its derivation is uncertain. Cicero, in one passage, derived it from re and lego , and held that its real meaning was the repetition of prayers and incantations. Another interpretation derives the word from re and logo , and makes its original sense that of attachment, of a continual binding (that is, no doubt to the deities). A third derivation connects the word with lex , and explains it as a law-abiding, scrupulously conscientious frame of mind. Buddhism is not strictly a religion in the sense in which that word is commonly understood, for it is not a system of faith and wor- ship, owing any allegiance to a supernatural deity. Buddhism does not demand blind faith from its adherents. Hence mere belief is dethroned and for it is substituted confi dence based on knowledge. It is possible for a Buddhist to entertain occasional doubts until he attains the fi rst stage of sainthood ( sotàpatti ) when all doubts about the Buddha, Dhamma, and the sangha are completely resolved. One becomes a genuine follower of the Buddha only after attaining this stage. The confi dence of a follower of the Buddha is like that of a patient in respect of a noted physician, or of a student regarding his teacher. Although a Buddhist seeks refuge in the Buddha as his incomparable guide and teacher who indicates the path of purity, he makes no servile surrender. A Buddhist does not think that he can gain purity merely by seeking refuge in the Buddha or by mere faith in Him. It is not within the power even of a Buddha to wash away the impurities of others. Strictly speaking, one can neither purify nor defi le another. The Buddha, as teacher, may be instrumental, but we ourselves are responsible for our purifi cation. A Buddhist is not a slave to a book or to any individual. Nor does he sacrifi ce his freedom of thought by becoming a follower of the Buddha. He is at full liberty to exercise his own free-will and develop his knowledge even to the extent of attaining Buddhahood, for all are potential Buddhas.

Upananda was a very eloquent preacher. He used to preach to others not to be greedy and to have only a few wants and would talk eloquently on the merits of content- ment and frugality ( appicchatà ) and austere practices ( dhåtàn- gas ). However, he did not practice what he taught and took for himself all the robes and other requisites that were given by others.

He asked them how many robes each monk usually received as donation for the vassa in their monastery and they told him that they usually received one robe each. So he did not stop there, but he left his slippers in that monastery. At the next monastery, he learned that the monks usually received two robes each for the vassa ; there he left his staff.

This exhortation does not in any way imply that the Buddha advocated selfi shness. On the contrary, the Buddha only places priorities right. First, look after your liberation. Then only should you look after the others. This is in keeping with the essence of the Buddha’s Dhamma – the Teaching of the Buddha. It only means that without overcoming your own selfi shness fi rst, you cannot help others to do so. Dhamma is, literally, that which supports; it is the truth within us, relying upon which and by practicing which, we can cross over the ocean of troubles and worries. Dhamma is also the formulations of the truth which we can practice if we are interested to do so. In Dhamma there is no creed and there are no dogmas. A Buddhist is free to question any part of the Buddha’s Dhamma, indeed, the Buddha has encour- aged him to do so. There is nothing which he is forbidden to question, no teaching about which he must just close his mind and blindly believe. This is because faith in a Buddhist sense is not a blind qual- ity but is combined with wisdom. Thus a person is attracted towards the dhamma because he has some wisdom to perceive a little truth in it, meanwhile accepting with faith those teachings as yet unproved by him. In practicing the Dhamma, he fi nds that it does in fact work – that it is practical, and so his confi dence grows. With the growth of his confi dence he is able to practice more deeply, and doing this he realizes more of the truth – so confi dence grows stronger. Thus faith and wisdom complement and strengthen each other with practice. In this case, as in many other Buddhist teachings, it is easy to see why Buddhist teaching is symbolized by a wheel, for this is a dynamic symbol. But one who has seen the Dhamma-truth in himself, being rid of all mental defi lements and troubles, an arahat, has no faith, he has something much better, adamantine wisdom."},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"159.

The Buddha’s benefi cent and suc- cessful ministry lasted forty-fi ve years. From His thirty-fi fth year, the year of His Enlightenment, till His death in His eightieth year, He served humanity both by his way of life and by precept. Throughout the year He wandered from place to place, at times alone, sometimes accompanied by His disciples, expounding the Dhamma to the peo- ple and liberating them from the bonds of saüsàra. During the rainy season ( vassàna ) from July to November, owing to incessant rains, He lived in retirement as was customary with all ascetics in His time. The Buddha’s emphasis was doing it oneself – being practical. He never limited his mission to sermonizing alone. He set an example of practice. Those with most understanding know that the attainment which the Buddha attained, is open to all who devote themselves to the earnest practice of His Teachings. That, in fact, every human mind has the possibility to fi nd beneath the ages-old accumulation of rub- bish, the jewel of wisdom. It is in this that one may fi nd the most secure refuge. The Buddha Himself said: “Go to no external refuge.” Thus the last Buddha to appear in this world was Gotama and He inspired His followers both monk and laity to become as He had become, to model their life and practice on His own since the latter has Supreme Enlight- enment as its basis. It was open to anyone, He declared, to observe the precepts, to attain the concentrations, to cut off the false ego-sense and to blossom forth in the splendour of enlightenment. The Buddhas do not set their followers on a lower level and themselves upon an unattainable peak of supremacy but encourage them in many skilful ways to attain what they have attained, as this is something practical, something for each wise man to experience for himself."},{"pageNumber":681,"pageContent":"160.

Once, a young married woman asked permission from her husband to become a nun. Through ignorance, she went to join some nuns who were the pupils of Devadatta. This young woman was pregnant before she became a nun, but she was not aware of the fact at that time. But in due course, the preg- nancy became obvious and the other nuns took her to their teacher Devadatta. Devadatta ordered her to go back to the household life. She then said to the other nuns, “I have not intended to become a nun under your teacher Devadatta; I have come here by mistake. Please take me to the Jetavana Monastery, take me to the Buddha.” Thus, she came to the Buddha. The Buddha knew that she was pregnant before she became a nun and was therefore innocent; but he was not going to handle the case. The Buddha sent for King Pasenadi of Kosala, Anàthapiõóika, the famous rich man, and Visàkhà, the famous donor of the Pubbàràma Monastery, and many other persons. He then told Elder Upàli to settle the case in public. Visàkhà took the young woman behind a curtain; she examined her and reported to Venerable Upàli that the woman was already pregnant when she became a nun. Vener- able Upàli then declared to the audience that the woman was quite innocent and therefore had not soiled her morality ( sãla )."},{"pageNumber":683,"pageContent":"683 In due course, a son was born to her.

When he came of age he was admitted to the Sangha; as a monk, he took a meditation topic from the Buddha and went to the forest. There, he practiced meditation ardently and diligently and within a short time attained arahatship. However, he continued to live in the forest for twelve more years. Thus his mother had not seen him for twelve years and she longed to see her son very much. One day, seeing him, the mother nun ran after her son weeping and calling out his name. Seeing his mother, Kumàra- kassapa thought that if he were to speak pleasantly to his mother she would still be attached to him and her future would be ruined. So for the sake of her future (realization of Nibbàna) he was deliberately stern and spoke harshly to her: “How is it, that you, a member of the sangha, could not even cut off this affection for a son?” The mother thought that her son was very cruel to her, and she asked him what he meant. Kumàrakassapa repeated what he had said before. On hear- ing his answer, the mother of Kumàrakassapa refl ected: “O yes, for twelve years I have shed tears for this son of mine. yet, he has spoken harshly to me. What is the use of my affection for him?” Then, the futility of her attachment to her son dawned upon her and then and there, she decided to cut off her attach- ment to her son.

On a certain fast-day, Mahàkàla, a lay disciple, went to the Jetavana Monastery. On that day, he kept the fast by observ- ing the eight moral precepts ( uposatha sãla ) and listened to the discourses on the Dhamma throughout the night.

One day, some monks were talking amongst themselves when the Buddha came in and asked the subject of their talk. They answered that they were talking about Devadatta and then continued as follows: “Venerable! Devadatta is, indeed, a man without morality; he is also very avaricious. He has tried to gain fame and fortune by getting the confi dence of Ajàta- sattu by unfair means. He has also tried to convince Ajàta- sattu that by getting rid of his father, he (Ajàtasattu) would immediately become a powerful king. Having been thus mis- led by Devadatta, Ajàtasattu killed his father, the noble king, Bimbisàra. Devadatta has even attempted three times to kill you, our most venerable teacher. Devadatta is, indeed, very wicked and incorrigible!” After listening to the monks, the Buddha told them that Devadatta had tried to kill him not only now but also in his previous existences. The Buddha then narrated the story of a deer-stalker. “Once, while King Brahmadatta was reigning in Bàrà- nasi, the future Buddha was born as a deer, and Devadatta was then a deer-stalker.

Since you have vio- lated the natural law of trees, I am now leaving you for another tree.’ “Seeing the deer turning away, the deer-stalker dropped his spear to the ground and said, ‘Yes, you can now move on; for today, I have been wrong in my calculations.’ The deer who was the Buddha-to-be replied ‘O hunter! You have truly miscalculated today, but your evil kamma will not make any mistake; it will certainly follow you.’ Thus, Devadatta had attempted to kill me not only now but also in the past, yet he had never succeeded.” Then the Buddha continued, “Monks!

On one occasion, while the Buddha was giving a dis- course in the Veluvana Monastery, Devadatta came to him and suggested that since the Buddha was getting old, the duties of the sangha should be entrusted to him (Devadatta); but the Buddha rejected his proposal and also rebuked him and called him a spittle swallower (Khelasika). From that time, Devadatta felt very bitter towards the Buddha. He even tried to kill the Buddha three times, but all his attempts failed. Later, Devadatta tried another tactic. This time, he came to the Buddha and proposed fi ve rules of discipline for the monks to observe throughout their lives. He proposed (i) that the monks should live in the forest; (ii) that they should live only on food received on alms-rounds; (iii) that they should wear robes made only from pieces of cloth collected from rub- bi sh heaps; (iv) t h at t hey shou ld r e side u nder t r e e s; a nd (v) t h at they should not take fi sh or meat. The Buddha did not have any objections to these rules and made no objections to those who were willing to observe them, but for various valid con- siderations, he was not prepared to impose these rules of discipline on the monks in general.

One day, the Buddha asked Devadatta if it was true that he was trying to create a schism in the order, and he admitted that it was so. The Buddha warned him that it was a very serious offence, but Devadatta paid no heed to his warning. After this, as he met Venerable ânanda on his alms-round in Ràjagaha, Devadatta said to Venerable ânanda, “ânanda, from today I will observe the sabbath ( Uposatha ), and perform the duties of the order sepa- rately independent of the Buddha and his order of monks.” On his return from the alms-round, Venerable ânanda reported to the Buddha what Devadatta had said. On hearing this, the Buddha refl ected, “Devadatta is committing a very serious offence; it will send him to Avãci Niraya . For a virtuous person, it is easy to do good deeds and diffi cult to do evil; but for an evil one, it is easy to do evil and diffi cult to do good deeds. Indeed, in life it is easy to do some- thing which is not benefi cial, but it is very diffi cult to do something which is good and benefi cial.” Then on the Uposatha day, Devadatta followed by fi ve hundred Vajjian monks, broke off from the order, and went to Gayàsãsa. How- ever, when the two chief disciples, Sàriputta and Moggallàna, went to see the monks who had followed Devadatta and talked to them they realized their mistakes and most of them returned with the two chief disciples to the Buddha.

Of these, purifi cation of knowledge and vision ( ¤ànadassàna- visuddhi ) is the knowledge associated with any of the four kinds of supermundane path-consciousness. “Immediately upon this adaptation-knowledge there arises the maturity-knowledge ( gotrabhå- ¤àna ) taking as object the unconditioned, the standstill of existence, the absence of becoming, cessation, Nibbàna, while at the same time transcending the rank ( gotta – gotra , lineage), designation and plane of the worldling ( puthujjana ), and entering the rank designation and plane of the noble ones ( ariya ), being the fi rst turning towards Nibbàna as object, the fi rst thinking of it, the fi rst concentration on it, and the condition for the path – forming the culmination of insight, and never as such coming back again. “As the immediate continuation following upon that maturity knowledge ( gotrabhå-¤àna ), there arises the fi rst path-consciousness (Stream-entrance) for ever destroying the fi rst three of the ten fetters of existence ( saüyojana ), and closing the entrance to the lower worlds.

When the Buddha declared that he would realize parinibbàna in four months’ time, many puthujjana monks were apprehensive and did not know what to do; so they kept close to the Buddha. Attadattha, however, did not go to the Buddha and, having resolved to attain arahatship during the lifetime of the Buddha, was striving hard in the meditation practice. Other monks, not understanding him, took him to the Buddha and said, “Venerable, this monk does not seem to love and revere you as we do; he only keeps to himself.” The Venerable then explained to them that he was striving hard to attain arahatship before the Buddha realized parinibbàna and that was the only reason why he had not come to the Buddha. The Buddha then said to the monks, “Monks, those who love and revere me should act like Attadattha. You are not paying me homage by just offering fl owers, perfumes and incense and by coming to see me; you pay me homage only by practicing the Dhamma I have taught you, i.e., the Lokuttara Dhamma.” At the end of the discourse, Venerable Attadattha attained arahatship.

Volumes have been written in reply to this quite natural and simple question; they have, more and more, only confused the issue rather than clarifi ed it. The only reasonable reply to give to the question is that it can never be answered completely and satisfactorily in words, because human language is too poor to express the real nature of the Absolute Truth or Ultimate Reality which is Nirvàõa . Language is created and used by masses of human beings to express things and ideas experienced by their sense organs and their mind. A supramundane experience like that of the Absolute Truth is not of such a category. Therefore there cannot be words to express that experience, just as the fi sh had no words in his vocabu- lary to express the nature of the solid land. The tortoise told his friend the fi sh that he (the tortoise) just returned to the lake after a walk on the land. ‘Of course’ the fi sh said, ‘You mean swimming.’ The tortoise"},{"pageNumber":708,"pageContent":"708 tried to explain that one couldn’t swim on the land, that it was solid, and that one walked on it. But the fi sh insisted that there could be nothing like it, that it must be liquid like his lake, with waves, and that one must be able to dive and swim there. Let us consider a few defi nitions and descriptions of Nirvàõa as found in the original Pàli texts: ‘It is the complete cessation of that very ‘thirst’ ( taõhà ), giving it up, renouncing it, emancipation from it, detachment from it.’ ‘Calming of all conditioned things, giving up of all defi lements, extinction of “thirst”, detachment, cessation, Nibbàõa .’ ‘O bhikkhus, what is the Absolute ( Asaükhata , Unconditioned)? It is, O bhikkhus, the extinction of desire ( ràgakkhayo ) the extinction of hatred ( dosakkhayo ), the extinction of illusion ( mohakkhayo ). This, O bhikkhus, is called the Absolute.’ ‘O Ràdha, the extinction of “thirst” ( Taõh a k k h a yo ) is Nibbàõa .’ ‘O bhikkhus, whatever there may be things conditioned or unconditioned, among them detachment ( viràga ) is the highest. That is to say, freedom from conceit, destruction of thirst, the uprooting of attachment, the cutting off of continuity, the extinction of “thirst” ( taõhà ), detachment, cessation, Nibbàõa .’ ‘Here the four elements of solidity, fl uidity, heat and motion have no place; the notions of length and breadth, the subtle and the gross, good and evil, name and form are altogether destroyed; neither this world nor the other, nor coming, going or standing, neither death nor birth, nor sense-objects are to be found.’ It is incorrect to think that Nirvàõa is the natural result of the extinction of craving. Nirvàõa is not the result of anything. If it would be a result, then it would be an effect produced by a cause. It would be saükhata ‘produced’ and ‘conditioned’. Nirvàõa is neither cause nor effect. It is beyond cause and effect. Truth is not a result nor an effect. It is not produced like a mystic, spiritual mental state, such as dhyàna or samàdhi ."},{"pageNumber":709,"pageContent":"Chapter 13 Loka Vagga World"},{"pageNumber":710,"pageContent":"167.

The granddaughter of Visàkhà was fi lter- ing some water for the young monk, and when she saw her own refl ection in the big water pot she smiled. Seeing her thus smiling, the young monk looked at her and he also smiled. When she saw the young monk looking at her and smiling at her, she lost her temper, and cried out angrily, “You, with a shaven head! Why are you smiling at me?” The young monk retorted, “You are a shaven head yourself: your mother and your father are also shaven heads!” Thus, they quarrelled, and the young girl went weeping to her grandmother. Visàkhà came and said to the young monk, “Please do not get angry with my grand-daughter. But, a monk does have his hair shaved, his fi nger nails and toe nails cut, and putting on a robe which is made up of cut pieces, he goes on alms-round with a bowl. What this young girl said was quite right.” The young monk replied, “It is true, but why should she abuse me on that account?” At this point, the elder monk returned: but both Visàkhà and the old monk failed to appease the young monk and the young girl who were quarrelling.

After all, he had his head shaven to enter my order, didn’t he?” Hearing these words, the young monk went down on his knees, paid obei- sance to the Buddha, and said, “Venerable! You alone under- stand me: neither my teacher nor the great donor of the mon- astery understands me.” The Buddha knew that the monk was then in a receptive mood and so he said, “To smile with sensual desire is not right and it is improper to have ignoble thoughts.” At the end of the discourse, the young monk attained sotàpatti fruition.

For a certain time the Buddha made his fi rst journey to the city of Kapila, and when he arrived there, his kinsmen came forth to meet him and to greet him. On that occasion, in order to break the overwhelming pride of his kinsfolk, he cre- ated by supernormal psychic power a cloister of jewels in mid- air, and in this cloister walked up and down preaching the Dhamma. The hearts of his kinsfolk were straightaway endowed with faith, and beginning with the great king Sud- dhodana, all did reverence to him. Thereupon there fell upon the assemblage of his kinsfolk a shower of rain, with reference to which there arose a discussion among the multitude. Said the Buddha, “Monks, this is not the fi rst time a shower of rain has fallen upon an assemblage of my kinsfolk: the same thing happened in a previous state of existence also.” So saying, he related the Vessantara Jàtaka. Having heard him preach the Dhamma, his kinsfolk departed, not even one extending an invitation to the Buddha. Likewise, the king, although the thought occurred to him, If my son does not come to my house, where will he go?”, went home without inviting him. When he reached the royal residence, however, he caused rice- gruel and other kinds of food to be prepared for twenty thou- sand monks, and likewise seats to be provided for them.

They brought word of this to the king. The king went quickly out of his residence, adjusting his cloak as he went, and prostrating himself before the Buddha, said, “Son, why do you mortify me? I am overwhelmed with shame to see you going from house to house receiving alms. In this very city where you used to go in a golden carriage it would be improper for you to go from house to house in a golden litter receiving alms. Why do you put me to shame?” “Great king, I am not putting you to shame: I am merely keeping up the tradition of my lineage.” “But, my dear son, is it a tradition of my lineage to gain a livelihood by going from house to house receiving alms?” “No, great king, that is not a tradition of your lineage.

Arrangements were made for Him to reside at the Park of Nigrodha, a Sàkya. The conceited elderly Sàkyas, thinking to them- selves, “He is our younger brother, our nephew, our grandson,” said to the young princes: “You do him obeisance: we will sit behind you.” As they sat without paying Him due reverence he subdued their pride by rising into the air and issued water and heat from his body. The king, seeing this wonderful phenomenon, saluted Him immediately, saying that it was his third salutation. He saluted Him for the fi rst time when he saw the infant prince’s feet rest on the head of ascetic Asita whom he wanted the child to revere. His second salutation took place at the ploughing festival when he saw the infant prince seated cross-legged on the couch, absorbed in meditation. All the Sàkyas were then compelled to pay Him due reverence. Thereupon the Buddha came down from the sky and sat on the seat prepared for him. The humbled relatives took their seats eager to listen to His Teachings. At this moment an unexpected shower of rain fell upon the Sàkya kinsfolk. The occurrence of this strange phenom- enon resulted in a discussion amongst themselves. Then the Buddha preached the Ve s s a nt a ra Jàtaka to show that a similar incident took place in the presence of His relatives in a previous birth.

Why do you put me to shame?” “I am not putting you to shame, O great king! I am following the custom of my lineage,” replied the Buddha, to the king’s astonishment. “But, dear son, is it the custom of my lineage to gain a livelihood by seek- ing alms? Surely ours is the warrior lineage of Mahàsammata, and not a single warrior has gone seeking alms.” “O great king, that is the custom of yo u r r oy a l l i n e ag e. But t h i s i s t h e c u s t o m of my Budd h a l i n e ag e.

The righteous live happily both in this world and in the next.” Hearing it, the king realized the Teach- ing and attained the fi rst stage of sainthood. Immediately after, he took the Buddha’s bowl and, conducting Him and His disciples to the palace, served them with choice food. At the close of the meal the Buddha again exhorted him thus: “Lead a righteous life, and not one that is corrupt. The righteous live happily both in this world and in the next.” Thereupon the king attained the second stage of sainthood ( sakadàgàmi ) and Pajàpati Gotami attained the fi rst stage of sainthood ( sotàpatti ). On a later occa- sion when it was related to the Buddha that the king refused to believe that his son had died owing to his severe austerities without achieving his goal, the Buddha preached the Dhammapàla Jàtaka to show that in a previous birth too he refused to believe that his son had died although he was shown a heap of bones. At this time he attained the third stage of sainthood ( anàgàmi ). On his death-bed, the king heard the Dhamma from the Buddha for the last time and attained arahatship. After experi- encing the bliss of emancipation for seven days, he passed away as a lay arahat when the Buddha was about forty years old.

Then a deity appeared in the guise of a bràhmin at the palace gate and said that he could interpret the king’s dreams. When received by the king and requested to interpret the dreams, he explained them thus: (1) Accord- ing to the fi rst dream: the prince will soon give up his present condition, and surrounded by innumerable devas, he will proceed from the city and become a recluse: (2) According to the second dream: the prince having left his home, will very soon attain enlightenment and ten pow- ers of the mind: (3) According to the third dream: the prince will, after attaining enlightenment, arrive at the four intrepidities: (4) According to the fourth dream: the prince will set the wheel of the good doctrine in motion for the good of gods and men: (5) According to the fi fth dream: after the prince becomes a Buddha and setting the wheel of the Dhamma in motion, the sound of his preaching will extend through the highest heavens: (6) According to the sixth dream: after enlightenment he will scatter the gems of the Dhamma for the sake of gods and men and the eight classes of creatures: (7) The seventh dream signifi ed the misery and distress of the six heretical teachers whom the prince will, after enlightenment, discomfi t and expose."},{"pageNumber":722,"pageContent":"170.

However, as soon as she began to dance and sing, at that moment, just as in the case of the entertainment woman belonging to Santati the king’s minister, sharp pains arose within her, and then and there she died. Prince Abhaya was overwhelmed with sorrow at the death of this woman. Immediately the thought came to him, “With the single exception of the Buddha, there is no one who can extinguish my sorrow.” So he approached the Buddha and said to him, “Venerable, please extinguish my sorrow.” The Buddha comforted him by saying, “Prince, in the round of existences without conceivable beginning, there is no counting the number of times this woman has died in this"},{"pageNumber":727,"pageContent":"727 manner, and no measuring the tears you have shed as you have wept over her.” Observing that the prince’s grief was assuaged by the lesson, he said, “Prince, do not grieve: only immature folk allow themselves to sink in the sea of grief.” Explanatory Translation (Verse 171) yattha bàlà visãdanti vijànataü saïgo natthi cittaü ràjarathåpamaü imaü lokaü etha passatha yattha : wherein: bàlà : the immature; visãdanti : sink and perish; vijànataü : to those who are aware of reality; saïgo : clinging; natthi . there is not; cittaü : (like a) well decked; ràjarathåpamaü : royal carriage; imaü lokaü : this world; etha : come; passatha : see The spiritually immature ones are fully engrossed in this world, the glamour of which is deceptively like the decoration of a royal carriage.

It is a Buddha that realizes this Dhamma, which ever lies hidden from the ignorant eyes of men, until the Buddha comes and compassionately reveals it to the world. “Whether the Buddhas appear or not, O monks, it remains a fact, an established principle, a natural law that all conditioned things are transient ( anicca ), sorrowful ( dukkha ) and that everything is soulless ( anatta ). This fact the Tathàgata realizes, understands and when He has realized and understood it, announces, teaches, proclaims, estab- lishes, discloses, analyses, and makes it clear, that all conditioned things are transient, sorrowful, and that everything is soulless.” In the text Majjhima Nikàya the Buddha says: “Only one thing does the Buddha teach: suffering and the cessation of suffering.” This is the doctrine of reality. Those who are fully capable of seeing this reality are described as vijànataü – ‘The true awareness of reality’. To be a seer of reality, effort and discipline are necessary.

At that time, Venerable Revata was also staying at the monastery: unlike Sammu¤janã, Ven- erable Revata spent most of his time in meditation or deep mental absorption. Seeing Venerable Revata’s behaviour, Ven- erable Sammu¤janã thought the other monk was just idling away his time. Thus, one day Sammu¤janã went to Venerable Revata and said to him, “You are being very lazy, living on the food offered out of faith and generosity: don’t you think you should sometimes sweep the fl oor or the compound or some other place?” To him, Venerable Revata replied, “Friend, a monk should not spend all his time sweeping. He should sweep early in the morning, then go out on the alms-round. After the meal, contemplating his body he should try to per- ceive the true nature of the aggregates, or else, recite the texts until nightfall. Then he can do the sweeping again if he so wishes.” Venerable Sammu¤janã strictly followed the advice given by Venerable Revata and soon attained arahatship. Other monks noticed some rubbish piling up in the compound and they asked Sammu¤janã why he was not sweeping as much as he used to, and he replied, “When I was not mindful, I was all the time sweeping: but now I am no longer unmindful.” When the monks heard his reply"},{"pageNumber":731,"pageContent":"731 they were skeptical: so they went to the Buddha and said, “Venerable!

Angulimàla was the son of the head-priest in the court of King Pasenadi of Kosala. His original name was Ahiüsaka. When he was of age, he was sent to Taxilà, the renowned uni- versity town. Ahiüsaka was intelligent and was also obedient to his teacher. So he was liked by the teacher and his wife: as a result, other pupils were jealous of him. So they went to the teacher and falsely reported that Ahiüsaka was having an affair with the teacher’s wife. At fi rst, the teacher did not believe them, but after being told a number of times he believed them: and so he vowed to have revenge on the boy. To kill the boy would refl ect badly on him: so he thought of a plan which was worse than murder. He told Ahiüsaka to kill one thousand men or women and in return he promised to give the boy priceless knowledge. The boy wanted to have this knowledge, but was very reluctant to take life. However, he agreed to do as he was told. Thus, he kept on killing people, and not to lose count, he threaded a fi nger each of everyone he killed and wore them like a garland round his neck. In this way, he was known as Angulimàla, and became the terror of the countryside. The king himself heard about the exploits of Angulimàla, and he made preparations to capture him. When Mantàni, the mother of Angulimàla, heard about the king’s intention, out of love to her son, she went into the forest in a"},{"pageNumber":735,"pageContent":"735 desperate bid to save her son. By this time, the chain round the neck of Angulimàla had nine hundred and ninety-nine fi ngers in it, just one fi nger short of one thousand. Early in the morning on that day, the Buddha saw Angulimàla in his vision, and refl ected that if he did not inter- vene, Angulimàla, who was on the look out for the last person to make up the one thousand, would see his mother and might kill her. In that case, Angulimàla would have to suffer in niraya endlessly. So out of compassion, the Buddha left for the forest where Angulimàla was. Angulimàla, after many sleepless days and nights, was very tired and near exhaustion. At the same time, he was very anxious to kill the last person to make up his full quota of one thousand and so complete his task. He made up his mind to kill the fi rst person he met. Suddenly, as he looked out he saw the Buddha and ran after him with his knife raised. But the Buddha could not be reached while he himself was completely exhausted. Then, looking at the Buddha, he cried out, “O monk, stop! Stop!” and the Buddha replied, I have stopped, only you have not stopped.” Angulimàla did not get the signifi cance of the words of the Buddha, so he asked, “O monk! Why do you say that you have stopped and I have not stopped?” The Buddha then said to him, I say that I have stopped, because I have given up killing all beings, I have given up ill- treating all beings, and because I have established myself in universal love, patience, and knowledge through refl ection. But, you have not given up killing or ill-treating others and you are not yet established in universal love and patience.

At the conclusion of an alms-giving ceremony in âëavi, the Buddha gave a discourse on the impermanence of the aggregates (khandhàs). The main points the Buddha stressed on that day may be expressed as follows: “My life is imper- manent: for me death only is permanent. I must certainly die: my life ends in death. Life is not permanent: death is perma- nent.” The Buddha also exhorted the audience to be always mindful and to strive to perceive the true nature of the aggre- gate. He also said, “As one who is armed with a stick or a spear is prepared to meet an enemy (e.g., a poisonous snake), so also, one who is ever mindful of death will face death mindfully. He would then leave this world for a good destina- tion (sugati). Many people did not take the above exhortation seriously, but a young girl of sixteen who was a weaver clearly understood the message. After giving the discourse, the Buddha returned to the Jetavana Monastery. After a lapse of three years, when the Buddha surveyed the world, he saw the young weaver in his vision, and knew that time was ripe for the girl to attain sotàpatti fruition.

Meanwhile, the Buddha knew that the young weaver would come to listen to his discourse: he also knew that the girl would die when she got to the weaving shed. Therefore, it was very important that she should listen to the Dhamma on her way to the weaving shed and not on her return. So, when the young weaver appeared on the fringe of the audience, the Buddha looked at her. When she saw him looking at her, she dropped her basket and respectfully approached the Buddha. Then, he put four questions to her and she answered all of them. Hearing her answers, the people thought that the young weaver was being very disrespectful. Then, the Buddha asked her to explain what she meant by her answers, and she explained. “Venerable! Since you know that I have come from my house, I interpreted that, by your fi rst question, you meant to ask me from what past existence I have come here. Hence my answer, ‘I do not know;’ the second question means, to what future existence I would be going from here; hence my answer, ‘I do not know;’ the third question means whether I do know that I would die one day; hence my answer, ‘Yes, I do know;’ the last question means whether I know when I would die; hence my answer, ‘I do not know.’” The Buddha was satis- fi ed with her explanation and he said to the audience, “Most of you might not understand clearly the meaning of the"},{"pageNumber":740,"pageContent":"74 0 answers given by the young weaver.

With eyes full of tears he went to the Buddha and asked the Buddha to admit him to the Sangha. So, he became a monk, and not long afterwards, attained arahatship.

When the Buddha had exchanged friendly greetings with them, he preached the Dhamma to them in a pleasing manner. After listening to the Dhamma all those monks attained arahatship.

The magical powers constitute one of the six kinds of higher spiritual powers ( abhi¤¤à ). One distinguishes many kinds of magical powers, e.g., the power of determination ( adhitthàna iddhi ): i.e., the power of becoming oneself manifold, i.e., the power of transformation ( vikåbbanà ): i.e., the power of adopting another form: i.e., the power of spir- itual creation ( manomayà ): i.e., the power of letting proceed from this body another mentally produced body: i.e., the power of penetrating knowledge ( ¤àna-vipphàra ): i.e., the power of inherent insight to remain unhurt in danger. The power of penetrating concentration ( samàdhivipphàra ), produc- ing the same result. Noble power ( ariyà-iddhi ) is the power of controlling one’s ideas in such a way that one may consider something not repulsive as repulsive and something repulsive as not repulsive, and remain all the time imperturb- able and full of equanimity. This training of mind is frequently mentioned in the suttas , but only once the name of ariyà iddhi is applied to it. iddhi-pàda : roads to power, (or success) are the four following qualities, for as guides, they indicate the road to power connected therewith: and because they form, by way of preparation the roads to the power constituting the fruition of the path, namely the concentration of intention ( chanda-samàdhi ) accompanied by effort of will ( padhàna-sankhàra-samannàgata ), concentration of energy ( viriya ), concentration of consciousness ( citta ), and concentration of investigation ( vimaüsa ) accompanied by effort of will.

Once the monk has thus developed and often practiced the four roads to power, he enjoys various magical powers – hears with the divine ear heavenly and human sounds – perceives with his mind the mind of other beings – remembers many a former existence – perceives with the Divine Eye beings passing away reappearing – attains, after the extinction of biases, deliverance of mind and deliverance through wisdom, free from biases. Whosoever, O monks, has missed the four roads to Power, he has missed the right path leading to the extinction of suffering: but whosoever, O monks, has reached the Four Roads to Power, he has reached the right path leading to the extinction of suffering. iddhiyà àkàse yanti : those with psychic powers ( arahats ) travel through the sky.

Thus, the king and his subjects kept on competing in giving alms. Finally, Queen Mallikà thought of a plan: to implement this plan, she asked the king to have a grand pavilion built. Next, she asked for fi ve hundred white umbrellas and fi ve hundred tame elephants: those fi ve hundred elephants were to hold the fi ve hundred white umbrellas over the fi ve hundred monks. In the mid- dle of the pavilion, they kept ten boats which were fi lled with perfumes and incense. There were also two hundred and fi fty princesses, who kept fanning the fi ve hundred monks. Since the subjects of the king had no princesses, nor white umbrellas, nor elephants, they could no longer com- pete with the king. When all preparations were made, alms- food was offered.

He also refl ected that such offerings could only be made by a king. He was very glad because the king would share the merit of his good deeds with all beings. In short, the minister Junha rejoiced with the king in his un rivalled charity. The minister Kàla, on the other hand, thought that the king was only squandering, by giving away fourteen billion in a single day, and that the monks would just go back to the monastery and sleep. After the meal, the Buddha looked over at the audience and knew how Kàla the minister was feeling. Then, he thought that if he were to deliver a lengthy discourse of appreciation, Kàla would get more dissatisfi ed, and in consequence would have to suffer more in his next existence. On seeing the king, the Buddha said, “Great King! You should rejoice that you have succeeded in making the offer- ing of the unrivalled charity ( asadisadàna ).

He repeated these verses to the bràhmin Màgandiya of the king- dom of Kurus. A bràhmin named Màgandiya, dwelling in the kingdom of the Kurus, had a daughter likewise named Màgandiya, who possessed surpassing beauty. Many men of wealth and social position, both bràhmins and khattiyas, desired to have her as wife and sent word to Màgandiya, say- ing, “Give us your daughter.” But he refused them all alike, saying, “You are not good enough for my daughter.” Now one day, as the Buddha surveyed the world at early dawn, he perceived that Màgandiya had entered the net of his knowledge. Now the bràhmin tended the fi re regularly every day outside the village; accordingly the Buddha took bowl and robe early in the morning and went to that very place. The bràhmin surveyed the majestic form of the Buddha and thought to himself, “There is no man in this world comparable to this man; this man is suitable for my daughter; I will give my daughter to this man.” So he said to the Buddha, “Venerable, I have a single daughter, and I have looked in vain to fi nd a man suitable to be her husband. I have not given her to any one. But you are suitable for her.

The Buddha, instead of remaining in the place mentioned by the bràhmin, moved away and stood in another place, leaving a footprint where he had stood before. The bràhmin’s wife, who accompanied him, asked him, “Where is this man?” The bràhmin replied, “I said to him, ‘Remain in this place.’” Looking around, the bràhmin saw the footprint and showed it to his wife, saying, “This is his foot- print.” Now the bràhmin’s wife was familiar with the verses relating to signs and immediately said to the bràhmin, “Bràh- min, this is no footprint of one who follows the fi ve lusts.” The bràhmin replied, “Wife, you always see a crocodile in a drop of water. When I said to that monk, ‘I will give you my daugh- ter,’ he accepted my proposal.” The bràhmin’s wife replied, “Bràhmin, you may say what you like, but this is the footprint only of one who is free from lust.” Then said the bràhmin to his wife, “Wife, do not rattle on thus; come with me in silence.” Advancing a little way, he saw the Buddha, whereupon he pointed to him and said, “There is the man!” And approach- ing the Buddha, he said, “Venerable, I will give you my daugh- ter to wife.” The Buddha, instead of saying, “I have no need of your daughter,” said, “Bràhmin, I have something to say to you; listen to me.” The bràhmin replied, “Say it; I will listen.” Thereupon the Buddha related to the bràhmin the story of his past life, beginning with the Great Retirement. The Buddha, having renounced the glory of dominion, mounted his horse Kanthaka, and with Channa for companionship, proceeded forth on the Great Retirement.

For six years the Buddha practiced austerities, and when, through his individual effort, he had attained omniscience at the foot of the Bodhi-tree (Goatherd’s Banyan-tree) experiencing the bliss of emancipa- t i o n .

Said the daughters of Màra again, “Many and various are the tastes of men. Some like maidens, others like women in the prime of life, others like women who have reached mid-life, while still others like women who have passed mid-life. We will tempt him in various forms.

Thereafter, he was known as Buddha Gotama, one of a long series of Buddhas that appeared in the past and will appear in the future. He was not born a Buddha, but became a Buddha by His own efforts through a process of voluntary evolution of consciousness. The Pàli term Buddha is derived from bodhi , to be awakened. As He fully experienced the four extraordinary realities and as He arose from the slumbers of unawareness, He underwent a complete transformation from a self-centred being to a literally, and in every sense, selfl ess non-being or non-person. He not only attained to that state but He also expounded the reality He experienced and enlightened others. He is called a Sammà Sambuddha – a harmoniously Awakened One – to distinguish Him from Pacceka (solitary) Buddhas who only experience the reality but are incapable of enlightening others. Before His Awakening, He was called a bodhisatta, which means one who is aspiring to attain Buddhahood.

Through worry over a minor offence he had committed during that time, he was reborn as a nàga . As a nàga , he waited for the appearance of a Buddha. Erakapatta had a very beautiful daughter, and he made use of her as a means of fi nding the Buddha. He made it known that whoever could answer her questions could claim her for a wife. Twice every month, Erakapatta made her dance in the open and sing out her questions. Many suitors came to answer her questions hoping to claim her, but no one could give the correct answer.

Having had the correct answers to the above, the nàga princess sang out questions regarding the fl oods ( oghas ) of sensual desire, of renewed existence, of false doctrine and of ignorance, and how they could be overcome. Uttara answered these questions as taught by the Buddha. When Erakapatta heard these answers he knew that a Buddha had appeared in this world. So he asked Uttara to take him to the Buddha. On seeing the Buddha, Erakapatta related to the Buddha how he had been a monk during the time of Kassapa Buddha, how he had accidentally caused a grass blade to be broken off while travelling in a boat, and how he had worried over that little offence for having failed to do the act of exoneration as pre- scribed, and fi nally how he was reborn as a nàga .

It is the patient endurance of suffering infl icted upon oneself by others, and the forbear- ance of others’ wrongs. A Bodhisatta practises patience to such an extent that he is not provoked even when his hands and feet are cut off. In the Khantivàdi Jàtaka, it appears that not only did the Bodhisatta cheerfully endure the tortures infl icted by the drunkard king, who mercilessly ordered his hands and feet, nose and ears to be cut off, but requited those injuries with a blessing. Lying on the ground, in a deep pool of His own blood, with mutilated limbs, the Bodhisatta said, “Long live the king, who cruelly cut my body thus.” Pure souls like mine such deeds as these with anger ne’er regard.” Of his forbearance it is said that whenever he is harmed he thinks of the aggressor – ‘This person is a fellow-being of mine. Intentionally or unintentionally I myself must have been the source of provocation, or it may be due to a past evil kamma of mine. As it is the outcome of my own action, why should I harbour ill-will towards him?’ It may be mentioned that a Bodhisatta is not irritated by any man’s shameless conduct either. Admonishing His disciples to practise forbearance, the Buddha said in the Kakacåpama Sutta – “Though robbers, who are highway men, should sever your limbs with a two-handled saw yet if you thereby defi le your mind, you would be no follower of my teaching. Thus should you train yourselves: Unsullied shall our hearts remain. No evil word shall escape our lips. Kind and compassionate with loving-heart, harbouring no ill-will shall we abide, enfolding even these bandits with thoughts of loving-kindness. And forth from them proceeding, we shall abide radiating the whole world with thoughts of loving-kindness, expansive, measureless, benevolent and unifi ed.” Practicing patience and tolerance, instead of seeing the ugliness in others, a bodhisatta tries to seek the good and beautiful in all. khantã : patience; forbearance.

It can only be developed easily if restlessness"},{"pageNumber":779,"pageContent":"779 and aversion have already been subdued in the mind, as is done by meditation practice. Impatience which has the tendency to make one rush around and thus miss many good chances, results from the inabil- ity to sit still and let things sort themselves out, which sometimes they may do without one’s meddling. The patient man has many a fruit fall into his lap which the go-getter misses. One of them is a quiet mind, for impatience churns the mind up and brings with it the familiar anxiety- diseases of the modern business world. Patience quietly endures – it is this quality which makes it so valuable in mental training and particu- larly in meditation. It is no good expecting instant enlightenment after fi ve minutes practice. Coffee may be instant but meditation is not and only harm will come of trying to hurry it up. For ages the rubbish has accumulated, an enormous pile of mental refuse and so when one comes along at fi rst with a very tiny teaspoon and starts removing it, how fast can one expect it to disappear? Patience is the answer and determined energy to go with it. The patient meditator really gets results of lasting value, the seeker after ‘quick methods’ or ‘sudden enlightenment’ is doomed by his own attitude to long disappointment. Indeed, it must soon become apparent to anyone investigating the Dhamma that these teachings are not for the impatient. A Buddhist views his present life as a little span perhaps of eighty years or so, and the last one so far of many such lives. Bearing this in mind, he deter- mines to do as much in this life for the attainment of Enlightenment as possible but he does not over-estimate his capabilities and just quietly and patiently gets on with living the Dhamma from day to day. Rushing into Enlightenment (or what one thinks it is) is not likely to get one very far, that is unless one is a very exceptional character who can take such treatment and most important, one is devoted to a very skilful master of meditation. With patience one will not bruise oneself but go carefully step by step along the may. We learn that the Bodhisatta was well aware of this and that he cultured his mind with this perfection so that it was not dis- turbed by any of the untoward occurrences common in this world.

Buddhist monks are advised to practice in the same way. sacitta pariyodapanaü : clearing one’s mind. In the Buddhist system, the higher perceptions result from the purifi cation of the mind. In consequence, mind-cultivation and meditation assumes an important place in the proper practice of Buddhism. The mental exercise known as meditation is found in all religious systems. Prayer is a form of dis- cursive meditation, and in Hinduism the reciting of slokàs and mantràs is employed to tranquillise the mind to a state of receptivity. In most of these systems the goal is identifi ed with the particular psychic results that ensue, such as the visions that come in the semi-trance state, or the sounds that are heard. This is not the case in the forms of meditation practiced in Buddhism. Comparatively little is known about the mind, its functions and its powers, and it is diffi cult for most people to distinguish between self-hypnosis, the development of mediumistic states, and the real process of mental clarifi cation and direct perception which is the object of Buddhist mental development called bhàvanà (translated as meditation). The fact that mystics of every religion have induced in themselves states wherein they see visions and hear voices that are in accordance with their own religious beliefs, indicates that their meditation has resulted only in bringing to the surface of the mind the concepts already embedded in the deeper strata of their minds due to cultural conditioning. The Christian sees and converses with the saints of whom he already knows, the Hindu visualises the gods of the Hindu pantheon, and so on. When Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the Bengali mystic, began to turn his thoughts towards Christianity, he saw visions of Jesus in his meditations, in place of his former eidetic images of the Hindu Avatàrs .

There is still another possibility latent in the practice of meditation: the development of mediumistic faculties by which the subject can actually see and hear beings on different planes of existence, the devalokas and the realm of the unhappy ghosts, for exam- ple. These worlds being nearest to our own are the more readily acces- sible, and this could be the true explanation of the psychic phenomena of western spiritualism.

They may arise due to errors in meditation, but not only are they not its goal, but they are hindrances which have to be overcome. The Christian who has seen Jesus, or the Hindu who has conversed with Bhagavan Krishna may be quite satisfi ed that he has fulfi lled the purpose of his religious life, but the Buddhist who sees a vision of the Buddha knows by that very fact that he has only succeeded in projecting a belief onto his own mental screen, for the Buddha after his Parinibbàna is, in his own words, no longer visible to anyone. There is an essential difference, then, between Buddhist medita- tion and that practiced in other systems. The Buddhist embarking on a course of meditation does well to recognise this difference and to estab- lish in his own mind a clear idea of what it is he is trying to do. The root-cause of rebirth and suffering is unawareness ( avijjà ) conjoined with thirst ( tanhà ). These two causes form a vicious circle; on the one hand, concepts produce emotions, and on the other hand, emo- tions produce concepts. The phenomenal world has no meaning beyond the meaning given to it by our own interpretation. When that interpretation is based on past biases we are subject to what is known as vipallàsa , or distortions, sa¤¤à-vipallàsa , distortion of perception, citta-vipallàsa , distortion of temper and diññhi-vipallàsa , distor- tion of concepts which cause us to regard that which is impermanent ( anicca ) as permanent; that which is painful ( dukkha ) as pleasurable, and that which is impersonal ( anatta ), as personal. Consequently, we place a false interpretation on all the sensory experiences we gain through"},{"pageNumber":783,"pageContent":"783 the six receptors of cognition, that is, the eye, ear, nose, tongue, sense of touch and mind ( cakkhu , sota , ghàna , jivhà , kàya and mano àyatana ). It is known that the phenomena we know through these channels of cogni- tion, do not really correspond to the physical world. This has confi rmed the Buddhist view. We are misguided by our own senses. Pursuing what we imagine to be desirable, an object of pleasure, we are in reality only following a shadow, trying to grasp a mirage. These phenomena are unstable, painful and impersonal. We ourselves, who chase the illu- sions, are also impermanent, subject to suffering and without any real personality; a shadow pursuing a shadow. The purpose of Buddhist meditation, therefore, is to gain a more than intellectual understanding of this truth, to liberate ourselves from the delusion and thereby put an end both to unawareness and thirst. If the meditation does not produce results which are observable in the character of a person, and the whole attitude to life, it is clear that there is something wrong either with the system of meditation or with the method of practice. It is not enough to see lights, to have visions or to experience ecstasy. These phenomena are too common to be impres- sive to the Buddhist who really understands the purpose of Buddhist meditation. In the Buddha’s great discourse on the practice of mindfulness, the Mahà-Satipaññhàna Sutta , both the object of meditation and the means of attaining it are clearly set forth. Attentiveness to the movements of the body, and the ever changing states of the mind, is to be cultivated, in order that their real nature is known. Instead of identifying these physical and mental phenomena with the false concept of self, we are to see them as they really are; as movements of a physical body, subject to physical laws of causality on the one hand, and as a successive series of sensations, emotional states and concepts, arising and passing away in response to external stimuli. They are to be viewed objectively, as though they were processes not associated with ourselves but as a series of impersonal phenomena. From what can selfi shness and egotism proceed if not from the concept of Self ( sakkàyadiññhi )? If the practice of any form of meditation leaves selfi shness or egotism unabated, it has not been successful. A tree"},{"pageNumber":784,"pageContent":"784 is judged by its fruits and a man by his actions; there is no other crite- rion. Particularly is this true in Buddhist psychology, because the man is his actions. In the truest sense it is only the continuity of kamma and Vipàka which can claim any persistent identity, not only through the dif- ferent phases of one’s life but also through the different lives in this cycle of birth and death called saüsàra . Attentiveness with regard to body and mind serves to break down the illusion of self, and, not only that, it also eliminates craving and attachment to external objects, so that ultimately, there is neither the self that craves, nor any object of craving. It is a long and arduous discipline, and one that can only be undertaken in retire- ment. A temporary course of this discipline can bear good results in that it establishes an attitude of mind which can be applied to some degree in the ordinary situations of life. Detachment and objectivity are invaluable aids to clear thinking. They enable a man to sum up a given situation without bias, personal or otherwise, and to act in that situation with courage and discretion. Another gift it bestows is that of concentra- tion – the ability to keep the mind on any subject. This is the great secret of success in any undertaking. The mind is hard to tame; it roams here and there restlessly as the wind, or like an untamed horse, but when it is fully under control, it is the most powerful instrument in the whole universe. In the fi rst place, he is without fear. Fear arises because we associ- ate mind and body ( nàma – råpa ) with self, consequently, any harm to either is considered to be harm done to oneself. But he who has broken down this illusion, by realising that the fi ve khandha process is merely the manifestation of cause and effect, does not fear death or misfortune. He remains alike in success and failure, unaffected by praise or blame. The only thing he fears is demeritorious action, because he knows that no thing or person in the world can harm him except himself, and as his detachment increases, he becomes less and less liable to demeritorious deeds. Unwholesome action comes of an unwholesome mind, and as the mind becomes purifi ed, healed of its disorders, negative kamma ceases to accumulate. He comes to have a horror of wrong action and to take greater and greater delight in those deeds which stem from alobha , adosa and amoha – generosity, benevolence and wisdom."},{"pageNumber":785,"pageContent":"186.

The story goes that after this monk had been admitted to the Sangha and had made his full profession, his preceptor sent him forth, saying, “Go to such and such a place and learn the Ordinances.” No sooner had the monk gone there than his father fell sick. Now the father desired greatly to see his son, but found no one able to summon him. When he was at the point of death, he began to chatter and prattle for love of his son. Putting a hundred pieces of money in the hands of his youngest son, he said to him, “Take this money and use it to buy a bowl and robe for my son.” In so saying, he died. When the young monk returned home, his youngest brother fl ung himself at his feet, and rolling on the ground, wept and said, “Venerable, your father was praising you when he died and placed in my hand a hundred pieces of gold. What shall I do with it?” The young monk refused to take the money, saying, “I have no need of this money.” After a time, however, he thought to himself, “What is the use of living if I am obliged to gain my living by going from house to house for alms?

The Buddha asked him, “Is the report true that you are discontented?” “Yes, Venerable,” he replied. Again the Buddha asked him, “Why have you acted thus? Have you any means of livelihood?” “Yes, venerable.” “How great is your wealth?” “A hundred gold pieces, venerable.” “Very well; just fetch a few potsherds hither; we will count them and fi nd out whether or not you have suffi cient means of livelihood.” The discon- tented monk brought the potsherds. Then the Buddha said to him, “Now then, set aside fi fty for food and drink, twenty- four for two bullocks, and an equal number for seed, for a two-bullock-plow, for a spade, and for a razor adze.” The result of the count proved that the hundred gold pieces would be insuffi cient.

Koõda¤¤a was the youngest and the cleverest of the eight bràhmins who were summoned by King Suddhodana to name the infant prince. The other four were the sons of those older bràhmins. All these fi ve retired to the forest as ascetics in anticipation of the Bodhisatta while he was endeavouring to attain Buddhahood. When he gave up his useless penances and severe austerities and began to nourish the body sparingly to regain his lost strength, these favourite followers, disappointed at his change of method, deserted him and went to Isipatana. Soon after their departure the Bodhisatta attained Buddhahood. The venerable Koõda¤¤a became the fi rst arahat and the most senior member of the Sangha. It was Assaji, one of the fi ve, who converted the great Sàriputta, the chief disciple of the Buddha. From then on the number of the brotherhood increased.

When He found that his mind was pliable and was ready to appreciate the deeper teaching He taught the Four Noble Truths. Yasa’s mother was the fi rst to notice the absence of her son and she reported this to her husband. The man immediately dispatched horsemen in four directions and he himself went towards Isipa- tana, following the imprint of the golden slippers. The Buddha saw him coming from afar and, by His psychic powers, willed that he should not be able to see his son. When he approached the Buddha and respectfully inquired whether He had seen his son Yasa, the Buddha answered, “Well, then, sit down here please. You will be able to see your son”. Pleased with the happy news, he sat down. The Buddha delivered a discourse to him, and he was so delighted that he exclaimed, “Excellent, O’ Lord, excellent! It is as if a man were to set upright that which was overturned, or were to hold a lamp amidst the darkness, so that those who have eyes may see!” Even so has the doc- trine been expounded in various ways by the Buddha. “I take refuge in the Buddha, the Doctrine and the Sangha. May Buddha receive me as a follower, who has taken refuge from this very day to life’s end!” He was the fi rst lay follower to seek refuge with the three-fold formula. On hearing the discourse delivered to his father, Yasa attained arahat- ship. Thereupon the Buddha withdrew His will-power so that Yasa’s father would be able to see his son. He beheld his son and invited the Buddha and His disciples for alms on the following day. The Buddha expressed His acceptance of the invitation by His silence.

Ven- erable Yasa had four distinguished friends named Vimala, Subhàhu, Puõõaji and Gavampati. When they heard that their noble friend shaved his hair and with a yellow robe, entered the homeless life, they approached Venerable Yasa and expressed their desire to follow. Venerable Yasa introduced them to the Buddha, and, on hearing the Dhamma, they also attained arahatship. Fifty more worthy friends of Venerable Yasa, who belonged to leading families of various districts, also receiving instructions from the Buddha, attained arahatship and entered the Sangha. Hardly two months had elapsed since His Enlightenment when the number of arahats gradually rose to sixty. All of them came from distinguished families and were worthy sons of worthy fathers. The Buddha, who long before succeeded in enlightening sixty disciples, decided to send them as messengers of Truth to teach His new Dhamma to all with- out any distinction. Before dispatching them in various directions He exhorted them as follows: “Freed am I, O’ Monks, from all bonds, whether divine or human. “You, too, O’ Monks, are freed from all bonds, whether divine or human. “Go forth, O’ Monks, for the good of the many, for the happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the good, benefi t, and happiness of gods and men.

It appears that Aggidatta was the house-priest of Mahà Kosala. When Mahà Kosala died, his son King Pasenadi Kosala, out of respect for Aggidatta since he had been his father’s house-priest, reappointed him to the same post. Whenever Aggidatta came to wait upon the king, the king would go forth to meet him and would provide him with a seat of equal dignity with himself and say to him, “Teacher, pray sit here.” After a time, however, Aggidatta thought to himself, “This king pays me very great deference, but it is impossible to remain in the good graces of kings for good and all. Life in a king’s household is very pleasant for one who is of equal age with the king. But I am an old man and therefore had best become a monk.” Accordingly Aggidatta asked per- mission of the king to become a monk, caused a drum to be beaten throughout the city, spent all of his wealth by way of alms in the course of a week, and retired from the world, becoming a monk of an heretical order.

So, whenever they were troubled by unlawful thoughts, whether lustful, malevolent, or cruel, they did as he had commanded them to do. In the course of time there arose a great heap of sand, and Ahic- chatta, king of the nàgas (dragons), took possession of it. The dwellers in Anga and Magadha and the dwellers in the king- dom of the Kurus, month by month, brought rich offerings in honour of those monks. Now Aggidatta admonished them as follows, “So surely as you seek refuge in a mountain, so surely as you seek refuge in a forest, so surely as you seek refuge in a grove, so surely as you seek refuge in a tree, even so surely will you obtain release from all suffering.” With this admoni- tion did Aggidatta admonish his disciples. At this time the future Buddha, after going forth on the great retirement, and after attaining complete enlightenment, took up his residence at Jetavana Monastery near Sàvatthi. Surveying the world at dawn he perceived that the bràhmin Aggidatta, together with his disciples, had entered the net of his knowledge. So he considered within himself, “Do all these living beings possess the faculties requisite for arahatship?” Perceiving that they possessed the requisite faculties, he said in the evening to Venerable Moggallàna, “Moggallàna, do you observe that the bràhmin Aggidatta is urging upon the multitude a course of action other than the right one? Go and"},{"pageNumber":796,"pageContent":"796 admonish them.” “Venerable, these monks are very numer- ous, and if I go alone, I fear that they will prove to be intracta- ble; but if you also go, they will be tractable.” “Moggallàna, I will also go, but you go ahead.” As the Venerable proceeded, he thought to himself, “These monks are both powerful and numerous. If I say a word to them when they are all gathered together, they will all rise against me in troops.” Therefore by his own super- natural power he caused great drops of rain to fall. When those great drops of rain fell, the monks arose, one after another, and each entered his own bower of leaves and grass. The Venerable went and stood at the door of Aggidatta’s leafy hut and called out, “Aggidatta!” When Agidatta heard the sound of the Venerable’s voice, he thought to himself, “There is no one in this world who is able to address me by name; who can it be that thus addresses me by name?” And in the stubbornness of pride, he replied, “Who is that?” “It is I, bràh- min.” “What have you to say?” “Show me a place here where I can spend this one night.” “There is no place for you to stay here; here is but a single hut of leaves and grass for a single monk.” “Aggidatta, men go to the abode of men, cattle to the abode of cattle, and monks to the abode of monks; do not so; give me a lodging.” “Are you a monk?” “Yes, I am a monk.” “If you are a monk, where is your alms vessel? What monastic utensils have you?” “I have utensils, but since it is inconven- ient to carry them about from place to place, I procure them within and then go my way.” “So you intend to procure them within and then go your way!” said Aggidatta angrily to the Venerable.

When the nàga -king saw him approaching, he thought to himself. “Yonder monk approaches hither. Doubtless he does not know that I am here. I will spit fi re at him and kill him.” The Vener- able thought to himself, “This nàga -king doubtless thinks, ‘I alone am able to spit smoke; others are not able to do this.’” So the Venerable spat fi re himself. Puffs of smoke arose from the bodies of both and ascended to the World of Brahma. The puffs of smoke gave the Venerable no trouble at all, but trou- bled the nàga -king sorely. The nàga -king, unable to stand the blasts of smoke, burst into fl ames. The Venerable applied him- self to meditation on the element of fi re and entered into a state of trance. Thereupon he burst into fl ames which ascended to the World of Brahma. His whole body looked as if it had been set on fi re with torches. The company of sages looked on and thought to themselves, “The nàga -king is burning the monk; the good monk has indeed lost his life by not listening to our words.” When the Venerable had over-mastered the nàga -king and made him quit his misdoing, he seated himself on the pile of sand. Thereupon the nàga -king surrounded the pile of sand with good things to eat, and creating a hood as large as the interior of a peak-house, held it over the Vener- able’s head."},{"pageNumber":799,"pageContent":"190.

At that moment, the Buddha drew near. The Venerable, seeing the Buddha, arose and saluted him. Said the sages to the Venerable, “Is this man greater than you?” The Venerable replied, “This is the Buddha; I am only his disciple.” The Buddha seated himself on the summit of the pile of sand. The company of sages said to each other, “If such is the supernatu- ral power of a mere disciple, what must the supernatural power of this man like?” And, extending their clasped hands in an attitude of reverent salutation, they bestowed praise on the Buddha. The Buddha said to Aggidatta, “Aggidatta, in giving admonition to your disciples and supporters, how do you admonish them?” Aggidatta replied, “I admonish them thus, ‘Seek refuge in this mountain, seek refuge in this forest, or grove, or tree. For he who seeks refuge in these obtains release from all suffering.’” The Buddha said, “No indeed, Aggidatta, he who seeks refuge in these does not obtain release from suffering. But he who seeks refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, he obtains release from the round of suffering.”"},{"pageNumber":801,"pageContent":"801 At the conclusion of the lesson all those sages attained arahatship, together with the superhuman faculties.

Now this was the day when all the dwellers in Anga and in Magadha and in the country of the Kurus were accus- tomed to come with rich offerings. When, therefore, they approached with their offerings, and saw that all those sages had become monks, they thought to themselves, “Is our bràh- min Aggidatta great, or is the monk Gotama great?” And because the Buddha had but just arrived, they concluded, “Aggidatta alone is great.” The Buddha surveyed their thoughts and said, “Aggidatta, destroy the doubt that exists in the minds of your disciples.” Aggidatta replied, “That is the very thing I desire to do.” So by superhuman power he rose seven times in the air, and descending to the ground, he saluted the Buddha and said, “Venerable, you are my Teacher and I am your disciple.” Thus did Aggidatta speak, declaring himself the disciple of the Buddha.

There is no effi cacy in praying to others or in depending on others. One might question why Buddhists should seek refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, and the Sangha, when the Buddha had explicitly advised His followers not to seek refuge in others. In seeking refuge in the Triple Gem, Buddhists only regard the Buddha as an instructor who merely shows the path of Deliverance, the Dhamma as the only way or means, the Sangha as the living examples of the way of life to be lived. Buddhists do not consider that they would gain their deliver- ance by merely reciting these words of commitment. One has to begin the practice of it. cattàri ariyasaccàni : the four extraordinary realities. Sacca is the Pàli term for reality, which means the reality that the Buddha awakened to, which is different from the ordinary and, therefore, is extraordinary. The Buddha enunciates a four-fold reality which provides foundation for His teaching, which is associated with the so-called existence or being. Whether the Buddhas arise or not, this reality remains and it is a Buddha who reveals it to the deluded world. It does not and cannot change with time, because it is available always. The Buddha was not indebted to anyone for his realization of it, as He Himself remarked in his discourse thus: “With regard to things unheard of before, there arose in me the eye, the knowledge, the gnosis, the insight and the light.” These words are very signifi cant because they testify to the originality of His experience. This reality, in Pàli, is termed ariya saccàni . They are so called because they were discovered by the Greatest Ariya, that is, one who has transcended the ordinary state and becomes extraordinary. The term ariya , usually translated noble, is here translated extraordinary, as opposed to the ordinary ( puthujjana ). We are making a distinction between ordinary or naive reality as seen by the common man on the street and the extraordinary reality experienced by the Buddha and his disciples."},{"pageNumber":807,"pageContent":"807 The fi rst part of the extraordinary reality deals with dukkha which, for need of a better English equivalent, is rendered suffering. As a feeling dukkha means pain. What is painful is, in short, the per- sonality which is an impossible burden that we constantly carry. We are unable to maintain it because it is unrealistic. Unhappiness results from the attempt to do the impossible. Average men are only surface-seers. An ariya sees things as they truly are. To an ariya life is suffering and he fi nds no real happiness in this world which deceives with illusory pleasures. Material happiness is merely the gratifi cation of some desire. All are subject to birth ( jàti ) and, consequently, to decay ( jarà ), disease ( vyàdhi ) and fi nally to death ( maraõa ). No one is exempt from these four phases of life. Life is not a static entity. It is a dynamic process of change. Self is a static concept that we try to maintain in a dynamic reality. This wish, when unfulfi lled, is suffering. While trying to maintain this self one meets unfavourables or one is sepa- rated from things or persons. At times, what one least expects or what one least desires, is thrust on oneself. Such unexpected, unpleasant circumstances become so intolerable and painful that weak people sometimes commit suicide as if such an act would solve the problem. The cause of this suffering is an emotional urge to ‘personalise’ what is experienced. The personality comes into being through this personalization. There are three kinds of urges. The fi rst is the urge to enjoy sensual pleasures ( kàmataõhà ). The second is the urge to exist or be ( bhavataõhà ). The third is the urge to stop existing ( vibhavataõhà ). According to the commentaries, the last two urges are connected with the belief in eternalism ( sassatadiññhi ) and the belief in annihilation- ism ( ucchedadiññhi ). Bhavataõhà may also be interpreted as attachment to realms of form and vibhavataõhà , as attachment to formless realms since råparàga and aråparàga are treated as two fetters ( samyojanas ).

The grossest forms of this urge for pleasure are attenuated on attaining sakadàgàmi , the second stage of sainthood, and it is com- pletely eradicated on attaining anàgàmi , the third stage of sainthood. The subtle forms of the urge for existence and non-existence are eradi- cated on attaining arahatship . The third aspect of the extraordinary reality is the complete ces- sation of suffering which is Nibbàna, the ultimate goal of Buddhists. It can be achieved in this life itself by the total eradication of all urges. This Nibbàna is to be realized ( sacchikàtabba ) by renouncing all attachment to the external world. This is the depersonalization of the aggregate of personalized phenomena ( pancupàdànakkhanda ) which comprise the personality or self. This third extraordinary reality has to be realized by devel- oping ( bhàvetabba ) the extraordinary eight-fold path ( ariyaññhaõgika magga ). This unique path is the only straight way to Nibbàna. This is the fourth extraordinary reality. ariya¤chaññhangikaü maggaü : the extraordinary eight-fold path. This unique way avoids the two extremes: self-mortifi cation that weakens one’s body and self-indulgence that retards one’s mind. It consists of the following eight factors: 1) Harmonious perspective ( Sammà Diññhi 2) Harmonious feeling ( Sammà Saükappa ) 3) Harmonious speech ( Sammà Vàcà ) 4) Harmonious action ( Sammà Kammanta ) 5) Harmonious living ( Sammà Ajãva ) 6) Harmonious practice ( Sammà Vàyàma ) 7) Harmonious introspection ( Sammà Sati ) 8) Harmonious equilibrium ( Sammà Samàdhi ) 1. Harmonious perspective is explained as the knowledge of the four extraordinary realities. In other words, it is the understanding"},{"pageNumber":810,"pageContent":"810 of oneself as one really is, because, as the Rohitassa Sutta states, these truths are concerned with the one-fathom long body of man. The key- note of Buddhism is this harmonious perspective which removes all confl icts within and without. 2. Clear vision leads to clear feeling. The second factor of the path is, therefore, Sammà Saükappa . The English renderings – right resolutions, right aspirations – do not convey the actual meaning of the Pàli term. Right feelings may be suggested as the nearest English equivalent. It is the emotional state or feelings that either defi les or purifi es a person. Feelings mould a person’s nature and control destiny. Evil feelings tend to debase one just as good feelings tend to elevate a per- son. Sometimes a single feeling can either destroy or save. Sammà Saükappa serves the double purpose of eliminating bad feelings and thoughts and developing good feelings. Right feelings, in this particular context, are three-fold. They consist of. (i) Nekkhamma – desire for renunciation of worldly pleasures, which is opposed to attachment, selfi shness, and self-possessiveness; (ii) Avyàpàda – feelings of loving-kindness, goodwill, or benev- olence, which are opposed to hatred, ill-will, or aversion, and (iii) Avihiüsà – feelings of harmlessness or compassion, which are opposed to cruelty and callousness. These evil and good feelings are latent in all. As long as we are ordinary people, bad feelings rise to the surface at unexpected moments in great strength. When they are totally eradicated on attaining arahatship, one’s stream of consciousness becomes pure. Harmonious feelings automatically lead to harmonious speech and action, which results in a harmonious life. These good feelings, however, have to be maintained only by constant practice in preventing and eliminating evil thoughts and the cultivation and maintenance of good thoughts. This leads to constant introspective awareness of the experience within. This results in the attainment of mental equilibrium. This undisturbed mind is aware of reality. This awareness maintains the peace that cannot be disturbed."},{"pageNumber":811,"pageContent":"193. Dullabho purisàja¤¤o na so sabbattha jàyati yattha so jàyati dhãro taü kulaü sukhamedhati.

One day, Venerable ânanda pondered thus: “Our Teacher has told us that thoroughbreds of elephants are born only among Chaddanta and Uposatha breeds, that thorough- breds of horses are born only among the Sindh breed, that thoroughbreds of cattle are born only among the Usabha breed.

The reference is to the birth of the Buddha. The Buddha is not born just anywhere. The would-be-sage was in heaven when he was invited by the deities and brahmas to be born on Earth as the Buddha. But the Buddha, before assenting to their wish, made what is called the fi ve great observations ( pa¤ca mahà-vilokana ). He observed, namely, the time, the continent, the country, the family, and the mother and her span of life. In the fi rst of these observations, he asked himself whether it was the right time or not. “It is not the right time when the length of men’s lives is more than a hundred thousand years. And why is it not the right time? For then the birth, ageing and dying of beings are not manifest, and there is no teaching of the Dhamma of Buddhas that is freed from the three characteristic marks, so that when they (Buddhas) are talking to these (people) about impermanence, anguish and no-self, they say, ‘What- ever is this they are talking about?’ and think it should neither be listened to nor believed. Consequently there is no penetration. This being so, it is a dispensation not leading out. Therefore, this is not the right time.” “Also, it is not the right time when men’s lives are less than a hundred years. And why is it not the right time? Then beings are abounding in defi lements; and an exhortation given to those who are abounding in defi lements makes no impression, but, like a mark drawn with a stick on the surface of the water, it immediately disappears. This, therefore, also is not the right time.” But when the length of men’s lives is between a hundred years and a hundred thousand years, then it is the right time. Now at that time men’s lives were a hundred years; accordingly, the Buddha observed that it was the right time for his birth."},{"pageNumber":814,"pageContent":"814 Next, he made the observation concerning the continent. Looking over the four continents with the surrounding islands, he refl ected, “In three of the continents the Buddhas are never born; only in Jambudãpa are they born.” Thus, he decided on the continent. Next, he made the observa- tion concerning the place. “The continent of Jambudãpa is large,” thought he, “being ten thousand leagues around. In which of its countries are the Buddhas born?” And, observing the region, he decided on the middle country in the city of Kapilavatthu. Then he made the observation concerning the family. “The Buddhas,” thought he, “are never born either in a vessa (merchant) family or in suddha (labourer) family. But they are born either in a khattiya (noble) fa m i ly or i n a bràhmin (pr ie st) fa m i ly wh ic hever i s t hen of t he h ig her repute in the world. At the present time the khattiya (noble) family is of the higher repute in the world. I will be born therein. The king named Suddhodana will be my father.” Thus, he decided on the family. Then he made the observation concerning the mother. “The mother of a Buddha,” thought he, “is never a wanton, nor a drunkard, but is one who had fulfi lled perfections through a hundred thousand cycles, and has kept the fi ve precepts unbroken from the day of her birth. Now this queen named Mahàmàyà is such a one. She shall be my mother. But, what shall be her span of life?” And he perceived that it was to be ten months and seven days. Having thus made the fi ve great observations, he kindly promised the devas what they requested, saying, “Venerables, you are right. The time has come for my Buddhahood.” Then, surrounded by the devas of the Tusita heaven, and dismissing all the other devas, he entered the Nandana Grove of the Tusita heaven, for in each of the heavens there is a Nandana Grove. And here, the devatàs said, “Attain in your next existence your high destiny,” and kept reminding him that he had already paved the way to it by his accumulated merit. Now it was while he was thus dwelling, surrounded by these deities, and continually reminded of his accumulated merit, that he died, and was conceived in the womb of queen Mahàmàyà. This event took place in the month of Esala (July, August), on the day of full-moon, early in the morning under the asterism ( nekata ) of Uttarasàlha."},{"pageNumber":815,"pageContent":"194.

Thus, they said, “To some people to have the riches and glory like that of a king is happiness, to some people sensual pleasure is happiness, but to others to have good rice cooked with meat is happi- ness.” While they were talking, the Buddha came in. After learning the subject of their talk, the Buddha said, “The pleas- ures that you have mentioned do not get you out of the round of rebirths.

In the traditional lore regarding the birth of Prince Siddhattha, who was later to become Buddha, there is an indication of the happiness he would bring to the world later as the Buddha. Now other mortals on issuing from the maternal womb are disagreeable; but not so the Bodhisatta. He issued from his moth- er’s womb like a preacher descending from his pulpit, or a man coming down stairs, stretching out both hands and feet without any impurities like a jewel thrown upon a vesture of Vàrànasi cloth. There are further details about this blissful event. Before the child touches the ground, he is received by four deities, and is presented to the mother, saying, “Be rejoiced, O’ Queen, you have given birth to a great being.” Four great kings received the child from the deities into a soft leopard skin, and from them the child was received by the retinue of the Queen into a silken robe. The child set his feet on earth, and faced the Easterly direction. A white canopy was raised over him. Innumerable universes appeared like one compound. Gods and men made offerings with fl owers and incense, etc., and said, “O Great Being, there is none to equal you here; whence any superior.” Looking on all sides the Buddha saw no equal of his, and took seven steps in the Northern direction. As the sev- enth step was taken, the Buddha declared, “I am the chief of the world. This is my last birth. There will be no more births for me.” For, this is the birth of the Buddha, the unique and marvellous being, who is born in the world out of compassion for the world, for the good, the benefi t and the happiness of gods and men. As the Buddha was born, a limitless super radiance surpassing that of the gods traversed through the entire universe. Myriads of gods in the heaven of Tàvatiüsa immensely rejoiced to hear of the birth of the future Buddha and engaged in much revelry and sport. At the time of the birth of the Buddha, there were also born Bhad- dhakaccànà (Yasodharà), the Ministers Channa and Kàludàyi, and Kanthaka, the horse. The Bodhi-tree and the four great treasures, too, arose at this time. Saïghassa sàmaggi : Sangha is the oldest, democratically constituted, historic celibate Order, founded by the Buddha.

One day Buddha departed from Sàvatthi, accompanied by a large company of monks and set out for Vàrànasi. On his way thither he came to a certain shrine near the village Todeyya. There the Buddha sat down, sent forth ânanda and bade him to summon a bràhmin who was tilling the soil nearby. When the bràhmin came, he omitted to pay reverence to the Buddha, but paid reverence only to the shrine. Having so done, he stood there before the Buddha. The Buddha said, “How do you regard this place, bràhmin?” The bràhmin replied, “This shrine has come down to us through genera- tions, and that is why I reverence it, Venerable Gotama.” Thereupon the Buddha praised him, saying, “In reverencing this place you have done well, bràhmin.” When the monks heard this, they entertained misgiv- ings and said, “For what reason did you bestow this praise?” So in order to dispel their doubts, the Buddha recited the Ghatãkàra Suttanta in the Majjhima Nikàya . Then by the super- human power, He created in the air a mountain of gold dou- ble the golden shrine of the Buddha Kassapa, a league in height.

At the conclusion of the lesson the bràhmin attained the fruit of conversion.

Why is the Buddha to be worshipped? His attainment of Enlightenment and his mission will elucidate it. The Buddha lived in Jambudãpa over 2,500 years ago, and was known as Siddhattha (in Sanskrit Sid- dhàrtha, the one whose purpose has been achieved). Gotama (in San- skrit Gautama) was his family name. His father, Suddhodana, ruled over the land of the Sàkyas at Kapilavatthu on the Nepalese frontier. Mahàmàyà, princess of the Koliyas, was Suddhodana’s queen. On the full-moon day of May – vasanta-tide, when in Jambudãpa the trees were laden with leaf, fl ower, and fruit – and man, bird and beast were in joyous mood, Queen Mahàmàyà was travelling in state from Kapi- lavatthu to Devadaha, her parental home, according to the custom of the times, to give birth to her child. But that was not to be, for halfway between the two cities, in the Lumbini Grove, under the shade of a fl owering Sal tree, she brought forth a son. Queen Mahàmàyà, the mother, passed away on the seventh day after the birth of her child, and the baby was nursed by his moth- er’s sister, Pajàpati Gotami. The child was nurtured till manhood, in refi nement, amidst an abundance of luxury. The father did not fail to give his son the education that a prince ought to receive. He became skilled in many a branch of knowledge, and in the arts of war and he easily excelled all others. Nevertheless, from his childhood, the prince was given to serious contemplation. When the prince grew up the father’s fervent wish was that his son should marry, bring up a family and be his worthy successor; but he feared that the prince would one day give up home for the homeless life of an ascetic."},{"pageNumber":822,"pageContent":"196. ...

The princess was of the same age as the prince. Lacking nothing of the material joys of life, he lived without knowing of sorrow. Yet all the efforts of the father to hold his son a prisoner to the senses and make him worldly-minded were of no avail. King Suddhodana’s endeavours to keep life’s miseries from his son’s inquiring eyes only heightened Prince Siddhattha’s curiosity and his resolute search for Truth and Enlightenment. With the advance of age and maturity, the prince began to glimpse the problems of the world. As it was said, he saw four visions: the fi rst was a man weakened with age, utterly helpless; the second was the sight of a man who was mere skin and bones, supremely unhappy and forlorn, smitten with some disease; the third was the sight of a band of lamenting kinsmen bearing on their shoulders the corpse of one beloved, for cremation. These woeful signs deeply moved him. The fourth vision, however, made a lasting impression. He saw a rec- luse, calm and serene, aloof and independent, and learnt that he was one who had abandoned his home to live a life of purity, to seek Truth and solve the riddle of life. Thoughts of renunciation fl ashed through the prince’s mind and in deep contemplation he turned homeward. The heart-throb of an agonized and ailing humanity found a respon- sive echo in his own heart. The more he came in contact with the world outside his palace walls, the more convinced he became that the world was lacking in true happiness. In the silence of that moonlit night (it was the full-moon of July) such thoughts as these arose in him: “Youth, the prince of life, ends in old age and man’s senses fail him when they are most needed. The healthy and hearty lose their vigour when disease suddenly creeps in. Finally, death comes, sudden perhaps and unexpected, and puts an end to this brief span of life. Surely, there must be an escape from this unsatisfactoriness, from ageing and death.” Thus the great intoxication of youth, of health, and of life left him. Having seen the vanity and the danger of the three intoxications, he was overcome by a powerful urge to seek and win the Deathless, to strive for deliverance from old"},{"pageNumber":824,"pageContent":"824 age, illness and misery to seek it for himself and for all beings that suffer. It was his deep compassion that led him to the quest ending in Enlightenment, in Buddhahood. It was compassion that now moved his heart towards the renunciation and opened for him the doors of the supreme cage of his home life. It was compassion that made his deter- mination unshakable even by the last parting glance at his beloved wife, asleep with their baby in her arms. Now at the age of twenty- nine, in the fl ower of youthful manhood, on the day his beautiful Yasodharà gave birth to his only son, Ràhula, who made the parting more sorrowful, he tore himself away. The prince, with a superhuman effort of will, renounced wife, child, father and the crown that held the promise of power and glory. In the guise of an indigent ascetic, he retreated into forest solitude, to seek the eternal verities of life, in quest of the supreme security from bondage – Nibbàna. Dedicating himself to the noble task of discovering a remedy for life’s universal ill, he sought guidance from two famous sages, Alàra Kàlàma and Uddaka Ràmaputta, hoping that they, being masters of meditation, would show him the way to deliverance. He practiced mental stillness and reached the highest meditative attainments possible thereby, but was not satisfi ed with anything short of enlightenment. Their range of knowledge, mystical experience, however, was insuffi cient to grant him what he earnestly sought. He, therefore, left them in search of the unknown truth. In his wanderings he fi nally reached Uruvela, by the river Nera¤jarà at Gayà. He was attracted by its quiet and dense groves and the clear waters of the river. Finding that this was a suit- able place to continue his quest for enlightenment, he decided to stay. Five other ascetics who admired his determined effort waited on him. They were Koõda¤¤a, Bhaddiya, Vappa, Mahànàma and Assaji. There was, and still is, a belief in Jambudãpa among many of her ascetics that purifi cation and fi nal deliverance from ills can be achieved by rigorous self-mortifi cation, and the ascetic Gotama decided to test the truth of it. And so there at Uruvela he began a determined struggle to subdue his body, in the hope that his mind, set free from the physical body, might be able to soar to the heights of lib- eration. Most zealous was he in these practices. He lived on leaves and roots, on a steadily reduced pittance of food, he wore rags, he slept"},{"pageNumber":825,"pageContent":"825 among corpses or on beds of thorns. He said, “Rigorous have I been in my ascetic discipline. Rigorous have I been beyond all others. Like wasted, withered reeds became all my limbs.” In such words as these, in later years, having attained to full enlightenment, did the Buddha give an awe-inspiring description of his early penances. Struggling thus, for six long years, he came nearly to death, but he found himself still away from his goal. The utter futility of self-mortifi cation became abundantly clear to him, by his own experience; his experiment with self mortifi cation, for enlightenment, had failed. But undiscouraged, his still active mind searched for new paths to the aspired-for goal. Then it happened that he remembered the peace of his meditation in childhood, under a rose-apple tree, and he confi dently felt: “This is the path to enlightenment.” He knew, however, that, with a body so utterly weakened as his, he could not follow that path with any chance of success. Thus he abandoned self-mortifi cation and extreme fasting and took normal food. His emaciated body recovered its former health and his exhausted vigour soon returned. Now his fi ve companions left him in their disappointment; for they thought that he had given up the effort, to live a life of abundance instead. Nevertheless with fi rm determination and complete faith in his own purity and strength, unaided by any teacher, accompanied by none, the Bodhisatta (as he was known before he attained enlighten- ment) resolved to make his fi nal search in complete solitude. Cross- legged he sat under a tree, which later became known as the Bodhi- tree, the Tree of Enlightenment or Tree of Wisdom, on the bank of Nera¤jarà River, at Gayà (now known as Buddha-Gayà) – at “a pleas- ant spot soothing to the senses and stimulating to the mind” making the fi nal effort with the infl exible resolution: “Though only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and my blood and fl esh dry up and wither away, yet will I never stir from this seat until I have attained full enlightenment ( sammà-sambodhi ).” So indefatigable in effort as he was, and so resolute to realize Truth and attain Full Enlightenment that he applied himself to the mindful in-and-out breathing ( àna + apàna sati ), the meditation he had developed in his childhood, and the Bodhi- satta entered upon and dwelt in the fi rst degree of meditative mental repose ( jhàna ; sanskrit, dhyàna )."},{"pageNumber":826,"pageContent":"Chapter 15 Sukha Vagga Happiness"},{"pageNumber":827,"pageContent":"197.

The story goes that the Sàkyas and the Koliyas caused the water of the River Rohinã to be confi ned by a single dam between the city of Kapilavatthu and the city of Koliya, and cultivated the fi elds on both sides of the river. Now in the month Jeññhamåla the crops began to fail, whereupon the labourers employed by the residents of both cities assembled. Said the residents of the city of Koliya, “If this water is diverted to both sides of the river, there will not be enough both for you and for us too. But our crops will ripen with a single watering. Therefore let us have the water.” The Sàkyas replied, “After you have fi lled your store- houses, we shall not have the heart to take gold and emeralds and pennies, and, baskets and sacks in our hands, go from house to house seeking favours at your hands. Our crops also will ripen with a single watering. Therefore let us have this water.” ‘We will not give it to you.” “Neither will we give it to you.” The talk waxed bitterly until fi nally one arose and struck another a blow. The other returned the blow and a general fi ght ensued, the combatants making matters worse by cast- ing aspersions on the origin of the two royal families."},{"pageNumber":829,"pageContent":"829 Said the labourers employed by the Koliyas, “You who live in the city of Kapilavatthu, take your children and go where you belong.

Are we likely to suffer harm from the elephants and horses and shields and weapons of destitute outcasts who have lived in the trees like animals?” Both parties of labourers went and reported the quarrel to the ministers who had charge of the work, and the ministers reported the matter to the royal households. There- upon the Sàkyas came forth armed for battle and cried out, “We will show what strength and power belong to those who have cohabited with their sisters.” Likewise the Koliyas came forth armed for battle and cried out, ‘We will show what strength and power belong to those who dwell in the trees.” As the Buddha surveyed the world at dawn and beheld his kinsmen, he thought to himself, “If I refrain from going to them, these men will destroy each other. It is clearly my duty to go to them.” Accordingly he fl ew through the air quite alone to the spot where his kinsmen were gathered together, and seated himself cross-legged in the air over the middle of the Rohinã River. When the Buddha’s kinsmen saw the Buddha, they threw away their weapons and did reverence to Him. Said the Buddha to His kinsmen, “What is all this quar- rel about, great king?” ‘We do not know, Venerable.” “Who then would be likely to know?” “The commander-in-chief of the army would be likely to know.” The commander-in-chief"},{"pageNumber":830,"pageContent":"830 of the army said, “The viceroy would be likely to know.” Thus the Buddha put the question fi rst to one and then to another, asking the slave-labourers last of all.

Then the Buddha addressed them and said, “Great kings, why do you act in this manner? Were I not here present today, you would set fl owing a river of blood. You have acted in a most unbecoming manner. You live in enmity, indulging in the fi ve kinds of hatred. I live free from hatred. You live affl icted with the sickness of the evil passions.

The Buddha was born Prince Siddhattha, the son of King Suddhodana, a Sàkya ruler. The Buddha’s (Prince Siddhattha’s) inti- mate relatives were closely linked with the Buddhist Sangha. Prince Siddhattha’s mother, Queen Mahàmàyà died within a few days of the Prince’s birth. Yasoddharà, Prince Siddhattha’s wife, was a cousin of his. Princess Yasoddharà, also known as Ràhulamàtà, Bimbà and Bhaddakaccànà, was the daughter of King Suppabuddha, who reigned over the Koliya race, and Pamità, sister of King Suddhodana. She was of the same age as Prince Siddhattha, whom she married at the age of sixteen. It was by exhibiting his military strength that he won her hand. She led an extremely happy and luxurious life. In her twenty- ninth year, on the very day she gave birth to her only son, Ràhula, her wise and contemplative husband, whom she loved with all her heart, resolved to renounce the world to seek deliverance from the ills of life. Without even bidding farewell to his faithful and charming wife, he left the palace at night, leaving young Yasoddharà to look after the child by herself. She awoke as usual to greet her beloved husband, but, to her surprise, she found him missing. When she realized that her ideal prince had left her and the new-born baby, she was overcome with indescribable grief. Her dearest possession was lost forever. The palace with all its allurements was now a dungeon; the whole world appeared to be blank. Her only consolation was her infant son. Though several Kshatriya princes sought her hand, she rejected all those pro- posals, and lived ever faithful to her beloved husband. Hearing that her husband was leading a hermit’s life, she removed all her jewellery and wore plain yellow garb. Throughout the six years during which the ascetic Gotama struggled for enlightenment Princess Yasoddharà watched His actions closely and did likewise. When the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu after His Enlightenment and was being entertained by the king in the palace on the following day all but the Princess Yasod- dharà came to pay their reverence to Him. She thought, “Certainly if"},{"pageNumber":835,"pageContent":"835 there is any virtue in me, the Buddha will come to my presence. Then will I reverence Him.” After the meal was over the Buddha handed over the bowl to the king, and, accompanied by His two chief disciples, entered the chamber of Yasoddharà, and sat on a seat prepared for Him, saying, “Let the king’s daughter reverence me as she likes. Say nothing.” Hearing of the Buddha’s visit, she bade the ladies in the court wear yellow garments. When the Buddha took His seat, Yasoddharà came swiftly to Him and clasping His ankles, placed her head on His feet and reverenced Him as she liked. Demonstrating her affection and respect thus, she sat down with due reverence. Then the king praised her virtues and, commenting on her love and loyalty, said, “Lord, when my daughter heard that you were wearing yellow robes, she also robed herself in yellow; when she heard that you were taking one meal a day, she also did the same; when she heard that you had given up lofty couches, she lay on a low couch; when she heard that you had given up garlands and scents, she also gave them up; when her relatives sent messages to say that they would maintain her, she did not even look at a single one. So virtuous was my daughter.” “Not only in this last birth, O’ king, but in a previous birth, too, she protected me and was devoted and faithful to me,” remarked the Buddha and cited the Candakinnara Jàtaka. Recalling this past asso- ciation with her, He consoled her and left the palace. After the death of King Suddhodana, when Pajàpatã Gotamã became a nun ( bhikkhunã ), Yasoddharà also entered the Sangha and attained arahatship. Amongst women disciples she was the chief of those who attained great supernormal powers ( mahà abhi¤¤à ). At the age of seventy-eight she passed away. Her name does not appear in the Therãgàthà but her interesting verses are found in the Apàdana . Ràhula was the only son of Prince Siddhattha and Princess Yasoddharà. He was born on the day when Prince Siddhattha decided to renounce the world. The happy news of the birth of his infant son was conveyed to him when he was in the park in a contemplative mood. Contrary to ordinary expectations, instead of rejoicing over the news, he exclaimed, “ Rahu jàto , bandhanam jàtam ” (Rahu is born, a fetter has"},{"pageNumber":836,"pageContent":"836 arisen!) Accordingly, the child was named Ràhula by King Suddhodana, his grandfather. Ràhula was brought up as a fatherless child by his mother and grandfather. When he was seven years old, the Buddha visited Kapila- vatthu for the fi rst time after His Enlightenment. On the seventh day after His arrival Princess Yasoddharà gaily dressed up young Ràhula and pointing to the Buddha, said, “Behold, son, that ascetic, looking like Brahma, surrounded by twenty thousand ascetics! He is your father, and He had great treasures. Since His renunciation we do not see them. Go up to him and ask for your inheritance, and say, “Father, I am the prince. After my consecration I will be a universal monarch. I am in need of wealth. Please give me wealth, for the son is the owner of what belongs to the father.” Innocent Ràhula came to the Buddha’s presence, and asking for his inheritance, as advised by his mother, very affectionately said, “O ascetic, even your shadow is pleasing to me.” After the meal, the Buddha left the palace and Ràhula followed Him, saying, “Give me my inherit- ance” and uttering much else that was becoming. Nobody attempted to stop him. Nor did the Buddha prevent him from following Him. Reach- ing the park the Buddha thought, “He desires his father’s wealth, but it goes with the world and is full of trouble. I shall give him the seven-fold noble wealth which I received at the foot of the Bodhi-tree, and make him an owner of a transcendental inheritance. He called Venerable Sàriputta and asked him to ordain little Ràhula. Ràhula, who was then only seven years of age, was admitted into the Sangha. King Suddhodana was deeply grieved to hear of the unexpected ordination of his beloved grandson. He approached the Buddha and, in humbly requesting Him not to ordain any one without the prior consent of the parents, said, “When the Buddha renounced the world it was a cause of great pain to me. It was so when Nanda renounced and espe- cially so in the case of Ràhula. The love of a father towards a son cuts through the skin, (the hide), the fl esh, the sinew, the bone and the mar- row. Grant the request that the Noble Ones may not confer ordination on a son without the permission of his parents.” The Buddha readily"},{"pageNumber":837,"pageContent":"837 granted the request, and made it a rule in the Vinaya. How a young boy of seven years could lead the religious life is almost inconceivable. But Sàmanera (novice) Ràhula, cultured, exceptionally obedient and well- disciplined as he was, was very eager to accept instruction from his superiors. It is stated that he would rise early in the morning and taking a handful of sand throw it up, saying, “Today, may I receive from my instructors as much counsel as these grains of sand.” One of the earliest discourses preached to him, immediately after his ordination, was the Ambalatthika-ràhulovàda Sutta in which He emphasized the importance of truthfulness. One day, the Buddha visited the Venerable Ràhula who, upon see- ing Him coming from afar, arranged a seat and supplied water for wash- ing the feet. The Buddha washed His feet and leaving a small quantity of water in the vessel, said, “Do you see, Ràhula, this small quantity of water left in the vessel?” “Yes, Lord.” “Similarly, Ràhula, insignifi cant, indeed, is the sàmanaship (monkhood) of those who are not ashamed of uttering deliberate lies.” Then the Buddha threw away that small quan- tity of water, and said, “Discarded, indeed, is the sàmanaship of those who are not ashamed of deliberate lying.” The Buddha turned the vessel upside down, and said, “Overturned, indeed is the sàmanaship of those who are not ashamed of uttering deliberate lies.” Finally the Buddha set the vessel upright and said, “Empty and void, indeed, is the sàmanaship of those who are not ashamed of delib- erate lying. I say of anyone who is not ashamed of uttering deliberate lies, that there is no evil that could not be done by him. Accordingly, Ràhula, thus should you train yourself. Not even in play will I tell a lie.” Emphasizing the importance of truthfulness with such homely illustrations, the Buddha explained to him the value of refl ection and the criterion of morality in such a way as a child could understand. “Ràhula, for what purpose is a mirror?” questioned the Buddha. “For the purpose of refl ecting, Lord.” “Similarly, Ràhula, after refl ecting and refl ecting should bodily action be done; after refl ecting should verbal action be done; after refl ecting should mental action be done.” “Whatever action you desire to do with the body, of that particular bodily action you should refl ect: ‘Now, this action that I desire to perform"},{"pageNumber":838,"pageContent":"838 with the body – would this, my bodily action be conducive to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to that of both myself and others?’ Then, unskillful is this bodily action, entailing suffering and producing pain.” “If, when refl ecting, you should realize: ‘Now, this bodily action of mine that I am desirous of performing, would be conducive to my own harm or to the harm of others, or to that of both myself and others.’ Then unskillful is this bodily action, entailing suffering and producing pain.

Such bodily action you should perform.” Exhort- ing the Sàmanera Ràhula to use refl ection during and after one’s actions, the Buddha said, “While you are doing an action with the body, of that particular action should you refl ect: ‘Now, is this action that I am doing with my body conducive to my own harm, or to the harm of others or to that of both myself and others?’ Then unskillful is this bodily action, entailing suffering and producing pain.” “If, when refl ecting, you realize: ‘Now, this action that I am doing with my body is conducive to my own harm, to the harm of others, and to that of both myself and others.’ Then unskillful is this bodily action, entailing suffering and producing pain.

Such a bodily action you should do again and again.” The Buddha said, “If, when refl ecting, you should realize: ‘Now, this action that I have done is unskillful.’ Such an action should be confessed, revealed, and made manifest to the Buddha, or to the learned, or to your brethren of the reli- gious life. Having confessed, you should acquire restraint in the future.

The many maid- ens went to the riverside to have a bath; after the bath they returned to the village fully dressed up, because it was a festi- val day. About the same time, the Buddha entered Pancasàla village for alms-food but none of the villagers offered him anything because they had been possessed by Màra. On his return the Buddha met Màra, who promptly asked him whether he had received much alms-food. The Buddha saw the hand of Màra in his failure to get any alms- food on that day and replied, “You wicked Màra! It was you who turned the villagers against me. Because they were pos- sessed by you they did not offer any alms-food to me. Am I not right?” Màra made no reply to that question, but he thought that it would be fun to entice the Buddha back to the village and get the villagers to insult the Buddha. So he sug- gested, “O Buddha, why don’t you go back to the village again? This time, you are sure to get some food.” Just then, the fi ve hundred village maidens arrived on the scene and paid obeisance to the Buddha.

In fi ghting against Ajàtasattu, the King of Kosala was defeated three times. Ajàtasattu was the son of King Bim- bisàra and Queen Vedehi, the sister of the King of Kosala. The King of Kosala was ashamed and very much depressed over his defeat. Thus his lamentation: “What a disgrace! I cannot even conquer this boy who still smells of mother’s milk. It is better that I should die.” Feeling depressed and very much ashamed, the king refused to take food, and kept to his bed.

This verse, which sums up the reality of victory and defeat was given by the Buddha, on the occasion of the defeat suf- fered by King Kosala, at the hand of King Ajàtasatta, his own nephew. King Pasenadi Kosala, the son of King Mahà Kosala, who reigned in the kingdom of Kosala with its capital at Sàvatthi, was another royal patron of the Buddha. He was a contemporary of the Buddha, and owing to his profi ciency in various arts, he had the good fortune to be made king by his father while he was alive. His conversion must probably have taken place during the very early part of the Buddha’s ministry. In the Samyutta Nikàya it is stated that once he approached the Buddha and questioning Him about His Enlightenment referred to Him as being young in years and young in ordination. The Buddha replied, “There are four objects, O’ Mahàràja, that should not be disregarded or despised. They are Khattiya (a warrior), a snake, fi re, and a mendicant monk. Then He delivered an interest- ing sermon on this subject to the King. At the close of the sermon the King expressed his great pleasure and instantly became a follower of the Buddha. Since then, till his death, he was deeply attached to the Buddha. It is said that on one occasion the king prostrated himself before Buddha and stroked His feet covering them with kisses. His chief queen, Mallikà, a very devout and wise lady, well versed in the Dhamma, was greatly responsible for his religious enthusiasm. Like a true friend, she had to act as his religious guide on several occasions. One day, the king dreamt sixteen unusual dreams and was greatly perturbed in mind, not knowing their true signifi cance. His bràhmin advisers interpreted them to be dreams portending evil"},{"pageNumber":845,"pageContent":"845 and instructed him to make an elaborate animal sacrifi ce to ward off the dangers resulting therefrom. As advised, he made all necessary arrangements for this inhuman sacrifi ce which would have resulted in the loss of thousands of helpless creatures. Queen Mallikà, hear- ing of this barbarous act about to be carried out, persuaded the king to get the dreams interpreted by the Buddha whose understand- ing infi nitely surpassed that of those worldly bràhmins. The king approached the Buddha and mentioned the object of his visit. Relat- ing the sixteen dreams he wished to know their signifi cance, and the Buddha explained their signifi cance fully to him. Unlike King Bimbisàra, King Kosala had the good fortune to hear several edifying and instructive discourses from the Buddha. In the Samyutta Nikàya there appears a special section called the Kosala Samyutta in which are recorded most of the discourses and talks given by the Buddha to the king. Once, while the king was seated in the company of the Buddha, he saw some ascetics with hairy bodies and long nails passing by, and rising from his seat respectfully saluted them calling out his name to them, “I am the king, your reverences, of the Kosala, Pasenadi.” When they had gone he came back to the Buddha and wished to know whether they were arahats or those who were striving for arahatship. The Buddha explained that it was diffi cult for ordinary laymen enjoy- ing material pleasures to judge whether others are arahats or not and made the following interesting observations: “It is by association ( sam- vàsena ) that one’s conduct ( sãla ) is to be understood, and that, too, after a long time and not in a short time, by one who is watchful and not by a heedless person, by an intelligent person and not by an unintel- ligent one.

Seeing the girl as she moved about the house helping with the offering of alms-food, the bridegroom was very much excited, and he could hardly attend to the needs of the Buddha and the other monks. The Buddha knew exactly how the young bridegroom was feeling and also that time was ripe for both the bride and the bride- groom to attain sotàpatti fruition. By his supernormal power, the Buddha willed that the bride would not be visible to the bridegroom. When the young man could no longer see the young woman, he could pay full attention to the Buddha, and his love and respect for the Buddha grew stronger in him. Then the Buddha said to the young man, “O young man, there is no fi re like the fi re of pas- sion; there is no evil like anger and hatred; there is no ill like the burden of the fi ve aggregates of existence ( khandhàs ); there is no bliss like Nibbàna.” At the end of the discourse, both the bride and bridegroom attained sotàpatti fruition.

The fact ought to be emphasized here that these fi ve groups, correctly speaking, merely form an abstract classifi cation by the Buddha, but that they as such, i.e., as just these fi ve complete groups, have no real existence, since only single representatives of these groups, mostly var- iable, can arise with any state of consciousness. For example, with one and the same unit of consciousness only one single kind of feeling, say joy or sorrow, can be associated, and never more than one. Similarly, two different perceptions cannot arise at the same moment. Also of the various kinds of sense-cognition or consciousness, only one of them can be present at a time, for example, seeing, hearing or inner con- sciousness. Of the fi fty mental formations, however, a smaller or larger number are always associated with every state of consciousness. Some writers on Buddhism who have not understood that the fi ve khandhàs are just classifi catory groupings, have conceived them as compact entities (heaps, bundles), while actually, as stated above, the Groups never exist as such, as they never occur in a simultaneous totality of all their constituents. Also, those single constituents of a group which are present in any given body-and-mind process, are of an evanescent nature, and so also their varying combinations.

It so happened that on that very day the man lost his oxen. So, he had to be looking for the oxen. Meanwhile, alms-food was being offered to the Buddha and his disciples in a house in the village of âlavi. After the meal, people got ready to listen to the Buddha’s discourse; but the Buddha waited for the young man. Finally, having found his oxen, the man came running to the house where the Buddha was.

(1) As the second link of the formula of dependent origination, ( pat- icca-samuppàda ), sankhàra has the active aspect, forming, and signi- fi es Kamma which is wholesome or unwholesome volitional activity ( cetanà ) of body ( kàya ), speech ( vacã ) or mind ( citta or mano ).

This three-fold division covers kammic activity in all spheres of existence: the meritorious kamma- formations extend to the sensuous and the fi ne- material sphere, the demeritorious ones only to the sensuous sphere, and the imperturbable only to the immaterial sphere. (2) The aforementioned three terms, kàya- , vacã- and citta (or mano ), are sometimes used in quite a different sense, namely as (a) bodily function as in-and-out-breathing; (b) verbal function as thought- conception and discursive thinking; and (c) mental function as feel- ing, perception. (3) It also denotes the fourth group of existence ( sankhàra-kkhan dha), and includes all mental formations whether they belong to kammi- cally forming consciousness or not. (4) It occurs further in the sense of anything formed ( sankhata ) and conditioned, and includes all things whatever in the world, all phenomena of existence. This meaning applies to the well-known passage “All formations are impermanent... subject to suffering” ( sabbe sankhàrà aniccà ... dukkhà ). In that context, however, sankhàrà is subordinate to the still wider and all-embracing term dhamma (thing); for dhamma includes also the unformed or unconditioned element ( asankhata-dhàtu ), i.e., Nibbàna (e.g., in sabbe dhammà anattà : all things are without a self). Sankhàrà also means ‘volitional effort’, e.g., in the formula of the Roads to Power ( iddhi-pàda ); in sasankhàrà- and asankhàra-parinibbàyi ( anàgàmã ); and in the Abhidhamma terms asankhàrika and sasankhàrika- citta , i.e., without effort – spontaneously, and with effort – prompted. Within the dependent origination, sankhàrà is neither subcon- scious nor a mere tendency, but is a fully conscious and active karmic volition. In the context of the fi ve groups of existence, a very few of the factors from the group of mental formations ( sankhàra-kkhandha ) are also present as concomitants of sub-consciousness, but are not restricted to it, nor are they mere tendencies."},{"pageNumber":854,"pageContent":"204. ârogyaparamà làbhà santuññhãparamaü dhanaü vissàsaparamà ¤àtã nibbàõaü paramaü sukhaü.

For at a certain period of his life King Pasenadi Kosala used to eat boiled rice cooked by the bucketful, and sauce and curry in proportion. One day after he had eaten his breakfast, unable to shake off the drowsiness occasioned by over-eating, he went to see the Buddha and paced back and forth before him with a very weary appearance. Overcome with a desire to sleep, but not daring to lie down and stretch himself out, he sat down on one side. Thereupon the Buddha said to him, “Did you come, great king, before you were well rested?” “Oh no, Venerable; but I always suffer greatly after eating a meal.” Then said the Buddha to him, “Great king, over-eating just brings such suffering.” So saying, the Buddha gave the fol- lowing stanza: “If a man gives way to indolence, eats too much, spends his time in sleep, and lies and rolls about like a great hog fed on grain, such a simpleton will endlessly be reborn.” After admonishing the king with this stanza, the Buddha continued, “Great king, one ought to observe moderation in eating, for in moderate eating there is comfort.” And admonishing him fur- ther, the Buddha gave the following stanza: “If a man be ever mindful, if he observe moderation in taking food, his sufferings will be but slight; he will grow old slowly, preserving his life.” The king was unable to memorize this stanza.

So both evening and morning, when the king ate his meal, his nephew would recite the stanza just as the king was about to take the last lump of boiled rice, and would fetch for his next meal just as many grains of fresh rice as there were grains of boiled rice in the lump of boiled rice which the king had thrown away. And every time the king heard that stanza recited, he gave away a thousand pieces of money in alms. The king con- tented himself with a pint-pot of boiled rice a day, never exceed- ing that amount. After a time he became cheerful and lean. One day the king went to pay his respects to the Buddha, and having saluted the Buddha, said to him, “Venerable, now I am happy. Once more I am able to follow the chase and to catch wild beasts and horses. I used to quarrel with my nephew. But recently, however, I gave my nephew my daughter, the Princess Vajirà, to wife.

But Venerable Tissa, having resolved that he would attain arahatship in the life-time of the Buddha did not go to him, but left for a secluded place to practice meditation. Other monks, not understanding his behaviour, took him to the Buddha and said, “Venerable! This monk does not seem to cherish and honour you; he only keeps to himself instead of coming to your presence.” Venerable Tissa then explained to them that he was striving hard to attain arahatship before the Buddha realized parinibbàna, and that was the only rea- son why he had not come to see the Buddha.

You pay homage to me only by practicing the lokuttara Dhamma such as insight meditation.” At the end of the discourse, Venerable Tissa attained sotàpatti fruition.

This stanza was pronounced on the declaration of his great demise by the Buddha. The Buddha’s pass- ing away – the great demise ( parinibbàna ) has been described in great detail in Buddhist literature. Venerable Subhadda, an arahat, was the last personal convert of the Buddha. The Venerable ânanda desired to know what they should do with the body of Buddha. The Buddha answered, “Do not engage yourself in honouring my remains. Be concerned about your own welfare, (i.e., arahatship). Be heedful, be strenuous, and be intent on your own good. There are wise warriors, wise bràhmins, wise householders who are fi rm believers in the Buddha. They will do honour to my remains.” At the conclusion of these talks Venerable ânanda went aside and stood weeping at the thought: ‘Alas! I am still a learner with work yet to do. But my leader will fi nally pass away. He who is my sympathiser.’ The Buddha, noticing his absence, summoned him to His presence and exhorted him thus: “Enough, O’ ânanda! Do not grieve, do not weep. Have I"},{"pageNumber":861,"pageContent":"861 not already told you that we have to separate and divide and sever ourselves from everything that is dear and pleasant to us?” “O’ ânanda, you have done much merit. Soon be freed from defi lements.” The Buddha then paid a tribute to Venerable ânanda, commenting on his salient virtues. After admonishing Venerable ânanda in vari- ous ways, the Buddha ordered him to enter Kusinara and inform the Mallas of his impending death. The Mallas were duly informed, and came weeping with their wives, young men, and maidens, to pay their last respects to the Buddha. Then the Buddha addressed ânanda and said, “It may be, ânanda, that you will say thus: ‘With- out the teacher is the sublime teaching! There is no teacher for us...’ Nay, ânanda, you should not think thus. Whatever doctrine and discipline have been taught and promulgated by me, ânanda, they will be your teacher when I am gone. Let the Sangha, O’ ânanda, if willing, abrogate the lesser and minor rules after my death.” Instead of using the imperative form the Buddha has used the subjunctive in this connection. Had it been His wish that the lesser rules should be abolished, He could have used the imperative. The Buddha fore- saw that Venerable Kassapa, presiding over the First Council, would, with the consent of the Sangha, not abrogate any rule – hence, His use of the subjunctive, states the commentator. As the Buddha has not clearly stated what these minor rules were and as the arahats could not come to any decision about them, they preferred not to alter any rule but to retain all intact. Again, the Buddha addressed the disciples and said, “If, O’ disciples, there be any doubt as to the Buddha, or the Dhamma, or the Sangha, or the Path, or the Method, question me, and repent not afterwards thinking, ‘We were face to face with the Teacher, yet we were not able to question the Buddha in His presence. When He spoke thus the disciples were silent. For the second and third time the Buddha addressed the disciples in the same way. And for the second and third time the disciples were"},{"pageNumber":862,"pageContent":"862 silent. Then the Buddha addressed the disciples and said, “Perhaps it may be out of respect for the Teacher that you do not question me. Let a friend, O disciples, intimate it to another.” Still the disciples were silent. Thereupon the Venerable ânanda spoke to the Buddha as follows: “Wonderful, Lord! Marvelous, Lord! Thus am I pleased with the company of disciples. There is not a single disciple who entertains a doubt or perplexity with regard to the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha, the Path and the Method.” “You speak out of faith, ânanda, with regard to this matter. There is knowledge in the Tathàgata, that in this company of disciples there is not a single disciple who enter- tains a doubt or perplexity with regard to the Doctrine, the Sangha, the Path and the Method. Of these fi ve hundred disciples, ânanda, he who is the last is a stream-winner, not subject to fall but certain and destined for enlightenment.” Lastly, the Buddha addressed the disciples and gave His fi nal exhortation: “Behold, O’ disciples, I exhort you. Subject to change are all component things. Strive on with diligence. ( vayadhammà samkhàrà appamàdena sampàdetha .) These were the last words of the Buddha. The Buddha attained to the fi rst ecstasy ( jhàna ). Emerging from it, He attained in order to the second, third, and fourth ecstasies. Emerging from the fourth ecstasy, He attained to the realm of the infi nity of space ( àkàsàna¤càyatana ). Then the Buddha, emerging from the cessation of perceptions and sensa- tions, attained to the realm of neither perception nor non-perception. Emerging from it He attained to the realm of nothingness. Emerg- ing from it, He attained to the realm of the infi nity of consciousness. Emerging from it, He attained to the realm of the infi nity of space. Emerging from it, He attained to the fourth ecstasy. Emerging from it, He attained to the third ecstasy. Emerging from it, He attained to the second ecstasy.

For when the Buddha’s aggregate of life was at an end and he was suffering from an attack of dysentery, Sakka king of deities became aware of it and thought to himself, “It is my duty to go to the Buddha and to minister to him in his sick- ness.” Accordingly he laid aside his own body, three-quarters of a league in height, approached the Buddha, saluted him, and with his own hands rubbed the Buddha’s feet. The Buddha said to him, “Who is that?” “It is I, Venerable, Sakka.” “Why did you come here?” “To minister to you in your sickness, Ven- erable.” “Sakka, to the gods the smell of men, even at a distance of a hundred leagues, is like that of carrion tied to the throat; depart hence, for I have monks who will wait upon me in my sickness.” “Venerable, at a distance of eighty-four thousand leagues I smelt the fragrance of your goodness, and therefore came I hither; I alone will minister to you in your sickness.” Sakka permitted no other so much as to touch him and the ves- sel which contained the excrement of the Buddha’s body; but he himself carried the vessel out on his own head. Moreover, he carried it out without the slightest contraction of the muscles of his mouth, acting as though he were bearing about a vessel fi lled with perfumes. Thus did Sakka minister to the Buddha.

It is not at all strange that Sakka king of gods should cherish warm affection for me. For because of me this Sakka king of gods laid aside the form of old Sakka, obtained the fruit of conversion, and took upon himself the form of young Sakka. For once, when he came to me terrifi ed with the fear of death, preceded by the celestial musician Pa¤casikha, and sat down in Indasàla Cave in the midst of the company of the gods, I dispelled his suffering by saying to him, “Vàsava, ask me whatever question you desire in your heart to ask; I will answer whatever question you ask me.” “Having dispelled his suffering, I preached the Dhamma to him. At the conclusion of the discourse fourteen billion of liv- ing beings obtained comprehension of the Dhamma, and Sakka himself, even as he sat there, obtained the fruit of con- version and became young Sakka. Thus I have been a mighty helper to him, and it is not at all strange that he should cher- ish warm affection for me.

The Buddha was an extraordinary being. Nevertheless He was mortal, subject to disease and decay as are all beings. He was conscious that He would pass away in His eightieth year. Modest as He was, He decided to breathe His last not in renowned cities like Sàvatthi or Ràjagaha, where His activities were centred, but in a distant and insignifi cant hamlet, like Kusinàrà. Here is a detailed account of the Passing Away of the Buddha. The Buddha, in the company of the Venerable ânanda, entered the stream Kakudha, drank its water, and bathed there. After cross- ing the stream, He entered the mango grove and spoke to the Vener- able Cunda. Addressing the Venerable ânanda, the Buddha said that Cunda should have no remorse that the Buddha fell ill after partak- ing of the meal offered by him. The Buddha came in the company of monks to the Sàla grove of the Mallas of Kusinàrà on the further side of the River Hirannavatã. There the Buddha spoke to the Venerable ânanda: “Prepare me a bed with its head to the North between the twin Sàla trees. I am tired, and I wish to lie down.” On the bed prepared there, the Buddha lay down with a stead- fast mind on His right side, in the pose of a lion, with one leg resting on the other. Now the twin Sàla trees were in full bloom out of sea- son, and the body of the Buddha was covered with the fl owers fallen out of reverence. Divine Mandàra fl owers were falling from above. Divine sandal wood powder was dropping from heaven. All these covered the Buddha’s body out of reverence. Divine music fi lled the atmosphere. The Buddha addressed ânanda: “O ânanda, all these fl owers, sandal wood powder and divine music are offerings to me in reverence. But no reverence can be made by these alone. If any monk or a nun or a male or female lay disciple were to live according to my teaching and follow my teaching, he pays me the proper respect; he does me the proper honour; and that is the highest offering to me, Therefore, ânanda, you should act according to my teaching and fol- low the doctrine, and it should be so taught.”"},{"pageNumber":871,"pageContent":"871 Now the Venerable Upavàna was standing before the Buddha, and was fanning Him. The Buddha did not like him standing there, and asked him to go to one side. The Venerable ânanda knew that the Venerable Upavàna was a long-standing attendant of the Buddha, and he could not understand why he was asked to go to one side. So he asked the Buddha why that monk was asked to go to one side. The Buddha explained that at that time all around the Sàla grove of the Mallas up to a distance of twelve leagues, there were heavenly beings standing, leaving no space even for a pin to drop, and that they were grumbling that they could not see the Buddha at His last moment as He was covered by a great monk. The Buddha said how the worldly gods were over-grieved at His passing away, but that the gods who were free from attachment and were mindful had consoled them- selves with the thought that all aggregates are impermanent. The Buddha addressed the Venerable ânanda again, and said: “There are these four places, ânanda, which a faithful follower should see with emotion. They are the place of birth of the Buddha, the place where the Buddha attained enlightenment, where the wheel of the doctrine was set in motion, and where the Buddha passed away. Those who may die while on their pilgrimage of these places, will be born in good states after death.” In answer to the Venerable ânanda, the Buddha said that the funeral rites for the Buddha should be as for a Universal Monarch, and that a Ståpa should be erected at a junction of four roads in honour of the Buddha. The Buddha also said that there are four persons in whose memory a Ståpa should be erected, and that they are the Buddha, a Pacceka Buddha, a disciple of the Buddha and a Universal Monarch. It was the wish of the Venerable ânanda that the Buddha should pass away not in a lesser and small town like Kusinàrà, but in a great city like Campà. Ràjagaha pointed out that Kusinàrà had been a great city with a long history, and requested the Venerable ânanda to inform the Malla princes of Kusinàrà of the imminent passing away of the Buddha. Accordingly, the Mallas were so informed at"},{"pageNumber":872,"pageContent":"872 their Town Hall. The Mallas came to the Sàla grove in great grief, and were presented to the Buddha in the fi rst watch of the night. Just at this time, a wandering ascetic by the name of Subhad- dha wanted to see the Buddha to get a certain point clarifi ed, but he was refused admission thrice by the Venerable ânanda. The Buddha overheard their conversation and entertained him. He wished to know whether the six religious teachers, such as Pårana Kassapa, were on the correct path. The Buddha said that only those who were on the eight-fold noble path shown by Him were on the correct road to emancipation. Subhaddha wished to be a disciple of the Buddha. Accordingly, he was admitted as the last disciple of the Buddha, and he became a sanctifi ed one. In giving further advice to the fraternity of monks, the Buddha said that in the future, the younger monks should not address their elders by their names or clan names or as friends, but as Venerable, or Reverend sir. The elder monks, however, could address the younger monks as friend or by clan name. The Buddha further said: “If any of you have any doubt or uncertainty whatsoever as to the Buddha, the teaching, the fraternity of monks, the path or the practice, you may seek clarifi cation now. Do not say later that you were facing the Buddha.” Although the Buddha spoke so thrice, no question was asked, and the Venerable ânanda assured the Master of their answering faith in Him. The Buddha said that even the last of those fi ve hundred monks had attained the path of Sotàpatti , and was certain of emancipation. Then the Buddha addressed His last words to the monks; “Now, O monks, I exhort you. All component things are subject to decay. Work for your salvation in earnest.” The Buddha entered into a number of stages of the mind, and after rising from the fourth stage of the trance, passed away. Imme- diately there arose a frightening and terrifying earthquake, and there burst forth thunders of heaven. As the Buddha passed away, the Venerable Anuruddha uttered forth: “The exhaling and the inhaling of the passionless Buddha of"},{"pageNumber":873,"pageContent":"873 steadfast mind have ceased, and He has passed away into the fi nal state of bliss. With an open mind He bore up the pain, and the release of His mind was like the extinction of a fl ame.” The Venerable ânanda observed: “The passing away of the Buddha is followed by terror with hair standing on ends.” Sahampati Brahma remarked: “Since this Teacher, the supreme individual in the world, endowed with all power and omniscience has passed away, it is natural for all beings in the world to cast away their lives.” Sakka uttered: “All component things are, indeed, impermanent. Everything is in the nature of rise and decay. Whatever that rise is subject to cessation, and blissful is their setting down.” There followed lamentations from worldly monks, but the Ven- erable Anuruddha exhorted them not to continue their lamentations. The Venerable Anuruddha and the Venerable ânanda spent the rest of that night in religious discussion. Then the Venerable Anurud- dha suggested that the sad news of the passing away of the Buddha should be conveyed to the Malla princes of Kusinàrà. Accordingly, the Venerable ânanda, accompanied by another monk, went to their assembly at the Town Hall, and conveyed the sad news to them. The Malla princes, as well as the other who heard the news, were over- come with grief, and were in great lamentation. The Mallàs collected all the fl owers and perfumes in their king- dom, and with all the music at their disposal went to see the body of the Buddha. For seven days, they paid their highest respects to the body of the Buddha. On the seventh day, eight leaders of the Mal- làs bathed themselves and being decked in clean garments, tried to raise the body to take it out through the southern gate for cremation. But, they were unable to move the body, and consulted the Venerable Anuruddha on the matter. The Venerable Anuruddha told them that it was the wish of the gods that the body of the Buddha be honoured by the gods as they like and be removed through the northern gate into the middle of the city and be taken out through the eastern gate to be cremated at the Makutabandhana Cetiya of the Mallàs. Then the matter was left to the wish of the deities."},{"pageNumber":874,"pageContent":"874 Now the entire city of Kusinàrà was strewn with divine Man- dàra fl owers up to knee deep uninterruptedly. After due respect was paid by both gods and the Mallàs with fl owers, perfumes and music, the body was taken to the Makutabandhana Cetiya of the Mallàs. In consultation with the Venerable ânanda, the Mallàs treated the body with all the honour due to a universal monarch. Four leaders of the Mallàs, dressed in new garments, tried to set fi re to the pyre, but they failed in their attempts. They consulted the Venerable Anuruddha on this point, and were told that until the Venerable Mahà Kassapa came and paid his respects to the body, no one could set fi re to the pyre. Now at this time, the Venerable Mahà Kassapa was proceeding from Pava towards Kusinàrà, in the company of fi ve hundred monks. On the way, he was resting at the foot of a tree by the side of the road. When he saw an ascetic with a Mandàrà fl ower in his hand coming from the direction of Kusinàrà. The Venerable asked him, “Friend, do you know our Teacher?” “Yes, my friend I know Him. He is the Ven- erable Gotama, who passed away seven days ago. I have taken this Mandàrà fl ower from the place of death.” When the worldly monks heard this sad news, they began to weep and lament, but the sanctifi ed ones among them consoled them- selves by observing that all aggregates are impermanent. One monk by the name of Subhadda, who had entered the order in his old age, expressed his feeling of relief at the passing away of the Buddha as they would no longer be bound by various rules of discipline, etc. The Venerable Kassapa gave an admonition to all the monks there, and proceeded towards Kusinàrà. The Venerable Mahà Kassapa reached the Makutabandhana Cetiya of the Mallàs, and went up to the funeral pyre of the Buddha. He adjusted his hands in reverence, went round the pyre three times. Then he uncovered the feet of the Buddha’s body, and worshipped them. The fi ve hundred monks who accompanied him, too, paid their last respects to the Buddha likewise.

But the Mallàs of Kusinàrà maintained that the Buddha passed away within their kingdom, and that they should give no part of the remains to anybody. The Bràhmin Dona settled the dispute by stating that it was not proper to quarrel over the remains of such a sacred personality who taught the world forbearance, and he measured the remains into eight portions, and gave each claimant one measure of the remains. He said for the empty measure, and erected a Ståpa in their respective kingdoms embodying the sacred relics of the Buddha. sappurisaü : the virtuous person. These verses extol the virtues of good people, the ariyas . The qualities and characteristics of virtuous ones are carefully discussed. The following view point establishes the nature of a sappurisa , a good person. To observe morality is like putting up a fence to protect the house against robbers. The social, economic, political and religious ideals are centred in ethics. The blood of life is love, and morality is its backbone. Without virtue life cannot stand, and without love life is dead. The development of life depends upon the development of virtue and the overfl ow of love rises when virtue rises. Since man is not perfect by nature, he has to train himself to be good. Thus morality becomes for everyone the most important aspect in life. Morality is not, for instance, a matter of clothing. The dress that is suitable for one climate, period or civilisation may be consid- ered indecent in another; it is entirely a question of custom, not in any way involving moral considerations, yet the conditions of convention are continually being confused with principles that are valid and unchanging."},{"pageNumber":876,"pageContent":"Chapter 16 Piya Vagga Affection"},{"pageNumber":877,"pageContent":"209.

The story goes that in a certain household at Sàvatthi there was an only son who was the darling and delight of his mother and father. One day some monks were invited to take a meal at the house, and when they had fi nished they recited the words of thanksgiving. As the youth listened to the words of the Dhamma he was seized with a desire to become a monk, and straightaway asked leave of his mother and father. They refused to permit him to do so. Thereupon the following thought occurred to him, ‘When my mother and father are not looking, I will leave the house and become a monk.” Now whenever the father left the house, he committed the son to the care of his mother, saying, “Pray keep him safe and sound;” and whenever the mother left the house, she committed the son to the care of the father. One day, after the father had left the house, the mother said to herself, “I will indeed keep my son safe and sound.” So she braced one foot against one of the door-posts and the other foot against the other door-post, and sitting thus on the ground, began to spin her thread. The youth thought to himself, “I will outwit her and escape.” So he said to his mother, “Dear mother, just"},{"pageNumber":879,"pageContent":"879 remove your foot a little; I wish to attend to nature’s needs.” She drew back her foot and he went out. He went to the mon- astery as fast as he could, and, approaching the monks, said, “Receive me into the Sangha, Venerables.” The monks com- plied with his request and admitted him to the Sangha. When his father returned to the house, he asked the mother, “Where is my son?” “Husband, he was here but a moment ago.” “Where can my son be?” thought the father, looking about. Seeing him nowhere, he came to the conclu- sion, “He must have gone to the monastery.” So the father went to the monastery and, seeing his son garbed in the robes of a monk, wept and lamented and said, “Dear son, why do you destroy me?” But after a moment he thought to himself, “Now that my son has become a monk, why should I live the life of a layman any longer?” So of his own accord, he also asked the monks to receive him into the Sangha, and then and there retired from the world and became a monk. The mother of the youth thought to herself, “Why are my son and my husband tarrying so long?” Looking all about, she suddenly thought, “Undoubtedly they have gone to the monastery and become monks.” So she went to the monastery and, seeing both her son and her husband wearing the robes of monks, thought to herself, “Since both my son and my hus- band have become monks, what further use have I for the house-life?” And, of her own accord, she went to the commu- nity of nuns and retired from the world.

The monks told the Buddha what was going on. The Buddha sent for them and asked them, “Is the report true that you are doing this and that?” They replied in the affi rmative. Then said the Buddha, “Why do you do so? This is not the proper way for monks and nuns to conduct themselves.” “But it is impossible for us to live apart.” “From the time of retirement from the world, such conduct is highly improper; it is painful both to be deprived of the sight of those who are dear, and to be obliged to look upon that which is not dear; for this reason, whether persons or material things be involved, one should take no account either of what is dear or of what is not dear.” Explanatory Translation (Verse 209) attànaü ayoge yu¤jaü yogasmiü ayojayaü ca atthaü hitvà piyaggàhi attànuyoginaü piheti attànaü : (where) one; ayoge : should not get engaged; yu¤jaü : who gets engaged; yogasmiü : where one should get engaged; ayojayaü : who does not engage; ca atthaü : what should be done; hitvà : neglecting; piyaggàhi : grasps only what appeals; attànuyoginaü : those who seek selfish ends; piheti : desire Being devoted to what is wrong, not being devoted to what is right, abandoning one’s welfare, one goes after pleasures of the senses.

As a feeling dukkha means that which is diffi cult to be endured ( du – diffi cult; kha – to endure). As an abstract truth dukkha is used in the sense of contemptible ( du ) and emptiness ( kha ). The world rests on suffering – hence, it is con- temptible. The world is devoid of any reality – hence, it is empty or void. Dukkha means contemptible void. Average men are only surface-seers. An ariya sees things as they truly are. To an ariya all life is suffering and he fi nds no real happiness in this world which deceived mankind with illusory pleasures. Material hap- piness is merely the gratifi cation of some desire. No sooner is the desired thing gained than it begins to be scorned. Insatiate are all desires. All are subject to birth ( jàti ), and consequently to decay ( jarà ), disease ( vyàdhi ), and fi nally to death ( marana ). No one is exempt from these four inevitable causes of suffering. Impeded wish is also suffering. We do not wish to be associated with things or persons we detest, nor do we wish to be separated from things or persons we love, Our cherished desires are not, however, always gratifi ed. What we least expect or what we least desire is often thrust on us. At times such unexpected unpleasant circumstances become so intolerable and painful that weak ignorant folk are compelled to commit suicide as if such an act would solve the problem. Real happiness is found within, and is not to be defi ned in terms of wealth, power, honours or conquests. If such worldly possessions are for- cibly or unjustly obtained, or are misdirected, or even viewed with attach- ment, they will be a source of pain and sorrow for the possessors. Ordinarily, the enjoyment of sensual pleasures is the highest and only happiness to an average person. There is no doubt a momentary hap- piness in the anticipation, gratifi cation, and recollection of such fl eeting material pleasures, but they are illusory and temporary. According to the Buddha non-attachment ( viràgatà ) or the transcending of material pleasures is a greater bliss. In brief, this composite body itself is a cause of suffering. This fi rst truth of suffering, which depends on this so-called being and various aspects of life, is to be carefully analyzed and examined. This examination leads to a proper understanding of oneself as one really is."},{"pageNumber":885,"pageContent":"885 Buddha has declared: Birth is dukkha . Birth means the whole process of life from conception to parturition. It is conception which is particularly meant here. Just to be caught up in a situation where one is tied down by bonds of craving to a solid, deteriorating, physical body – this is dukkha . By being lured into birth by craving or forced into it by kamma , one must expe- rience dukkha . Then the whole operation of birth is so painful that if it goes wrong in some way, as modern psychology has discovered, a deep mental scar, a kind of trauma, maybe left upon the infant’s mind. Lord Buddha, however, has declared from his own memories of infi nite births, that to be born is a terrifying experience, so much so that most people prefer to forget it. There is another sense in which birth is really dukkha , for, in Buddha’s Teachings, birth-and-death are different phases of existence from moment to moment. Just as in the body new cells are being produced to replace old ones which are worn out, so in the mind, new objects are being presented, examined and dying down. This constant fl ow goes on day and night, on and on, so that if it is examined carefully, (with insight), it will be seen to be an experiential disease giving no peace, ensuring no security, and resulting in no lasting satisfaction. In a moment of experience events arise, subsist and pass away but this is a meaning of birth-and-death only to be really understood with the aid of deep meditation and insight. Old age is dukkha . This is perhaps more obvious. Teeth fall out, one’s nice glossy hair becomes thin and white, the stomach refuses to digest one’s favourite food, joints ache and creak and muscles grow weak; more serious than these physical affl ictions are such manifestations as failing sight or diffi culty in hearing – pages might be covered with them all. Most terrible of all is the mind’s declining ability to understand or to react intelligently, the increasing grip of habits and prejudices, the disinclina- tion to look ahead (where death lies in wait) but to gaze back at the fondly remembered and increasingly falsifi ed past. Lastly, one might mention that softness of the mind which is politely called ‘second childhood’, and accurately called ‘senility’. Not all beings, not all people will be subject to all of these conditions, but growing old surely entails experiencing some of them, experience which can only be distasteful. Sickness is dukkha . Again, not all will be affected by diseases dur- ing life though it is certainly common enough.

One little gland or a few little cells going wrong somewhere, marching out of step, and how much misery can be caused! Most people, again, prefer not to think about this and so suffer the more when they are forced to face it. To be convinced of the commonness of ill- ness, one has only to look into hospitals, talk to doctors and nurses, or open a medical textbook. The diseases about which one can learn are enormous in number and fade off into all sorts of nasty conditions for which science has not yet been able to discover the causes. Mental diseases, brought on by a super-strong root of delusion variously mixed with greed and aversion, are also included here. In the First Sermon of the Buddha, the central concept is the notion of suffering. Said the Buddha: “The noble truth of suffering is this: Birth itself is suffering; old age is suffering; sickness is suffering; death is suf- fering, association with the unpleasant is suffering; separation from the beloved ones is suffering; non-acquisition of the desired objects is suffer- ing. In brief, all the fi ve aggregates of envelopment are suffering.” “The noble truth of the cause of suffering is this: It is this craving which causes rebirth, which is attended with enjoyment. It takes delight here and there, namely, in sensual desires, in existence and in destruction.” “The noble truth of the cessation of suffering is this: It is the complete avoidance, cessation, giving up, abandonment, release and detachment of that craving.” “The noble truth of the way to the cessation of this suffering is the noble Eight-fold Path consisting of proper vision and proper thought.” “This noble truth of suffering is a theory not heard of by me ear- lier, and in which arose my perception, insight, wisdom, knowledge and illumination. This noble truth of suffering, O monks, must be fully under- stood.” “This noble truth of the cause of suffering is a theory not heard of by me earlier, and in which arose my perception, insight, wisdom, knowledge and illumination. This cause of suffering, O monks, must in fact be given up; and it has been give up by me.” “This noble truth of the cessation of suffering is a theory not heard of by me earlier, and in which arose my perception, insight, wisdom, know- ledge and illumination. This noble truth, O monks, must indeed, be devel- oped; and it has been developed by me.”"},{"pageNumber":887,"pageContent":"212.

The story goes that this layman, on losing his son, was so overwhelmed with grief that he went every day to the burning-ground and wept, being unable to restrain his grief. As the Buddha surveyed the world at dawn, he saw that the layman had the faculties requisite for conversion. So when he came back from his alms-round, he took one attendant monk and went to the layman’s door. When the layman heard that the Buddha had come to his house, he thought to himself, “He must wish to exchange the usual compliments of health and civility with me.” So he invited the Buddha into his house, provided him with a seat in the house-court, and when the Buddha had taken his seat, approached him, saluted him, and sat down respectfully on one side. At once the Buddha asked him, “Layman, why are you sad?” “I have lost my son; therefore I am sad,” replied the lay- man. Said the Buddha, “Grieve not, layman. That which is called death is not confi ned to one place or to one person, but is common to all creatures who are born into this world. Not one of the elements of being is permanent.

On the contrary, they applied themselves dili- gently to meditation upon death, would not allow themselves to grieve, ate their food as usual, and attended to their wonted occupations. Therefore grieve not at the thought that your dear son is dead. For whether sorrow or fear arises, it arises solely because of one that is dear.” Explanatory Translation (Verse 212) piyato soko jàyatã piyato bhayaü jàyatã piyato vippamuttassa soko natthi bhayaü kuto piyato : because of endearment; soko : sorrow; jàyatã : is born; piyato : because of endearment; bhayaü : fear; jàyatã : arises; piyato vippamuttassa : to one free of endearment; soko natthi : there is no sorrow; bhayaü : fear; kuto : how can there be?

The whole day He was occu- pied with His religious activities, except when He was attending to His physical needs. He was methodical and systematic in the perform- ance of His daily duties. His inner life was one of meditation and was concerned with the experiencing of Nibbanic Bliss, while His outer life was one of selfl ess service for the moral upliftment of the world. Himself enlightened, He endeavoured His best to enlighten others and liberate them from the ills of life. His day was divided into fi ve parts, namely, (1) The forenoon session, (2) The afternoon session, (3) The fi rst watch, (4) The middle watch and (5) The last watch. Usually, early in the morning, He surveys the world with His divine eye to see whom he could help. If any person needs His spiritual assistance, uninvited He goes, often on foot, sometimes by air using His psychic powers, and converts that person to the right path. As a rule He goes in search of the vicious and the impure, but the pure and the virtu- ous come in search of Him. For instance, the Buddha went of His own accord to convert the robber and murderer Angulimàla and the wicked demon âlavaka, but pious young Visàkhà, generous million- aire Anàthapiõóika, and intellectual Sàriputta and Moggallàna came to Him for spiritual guidance. While rendering such spiritual service to whomsoever it is necessary, if He is not invited for alms-giving by a lay supporter at some particular place, He, before whom kings prostrated themselves, would go in quest of alms through alleys and streets, with bowl in hand, either alone or with His disciples. Standing silently at the door of each house, without uttering a word, He collects whatever food is offered and placed in the bowl and returns to the monastery. Even in His eightieth year when He was old and in indif- ferent health, He went on His rounds for alms in Vesàli. Before mid- day He fi nishes His meals. Immediately after lunch He daily delivers a short discourse to the people, establishes them in the Three Refuges and the Five Precepts and if any person is spiritually advanced, he is shown the path to sainthood. At times He grants ordination to them if they seek admission to the Sangha, and then retires to His chamber."},{"pageNumber":891,"pageContent":"213.

Commentary Visàkhà ’ s grief : The Buddha spoke this verse to pacify Visàkhà, the greatest female lay supporter of the Buddha in the early days of Bud- dhasàsana (The Dispensation of the Buddha). Visàkhà’s life is inti- mately interwoven with the early history of Buddhism. There is an incident in her life which reveals her dutiful kindness even towards animals. Hearing that her well-bred mare gave birth to a foal in the middle of the night, she immediately repaired to the stable with her female attendants bearing torches in their hands, and attended to all the mare’s needs with the greatest care and attention. As her father-in-law was a staunch follower of Niganñhanàta- putta, he invited a large number of naked ascetics to his house for alms. On their arrival Visàkhà was requested to come and render homage to these so-called arahats. She was delighted to hear the word arahat and hurried to the hall only to see naked ascetics devoid of all modesty. The sight was too unbearable for a refi ned lady like Visàkhà.

The naked ascetics took offence and found fault with the millionaire for having brought a female follower of the ascetic Gotama to his house. They asked him to expel her from the house immediately. The millionaire pacifi ed them. One day he sat on a costly seat and began to eat some sweet milk rice-porridge from a golden bowl. At that moment a monk entered the house for alms. Visàkhà was fanning her father-in-law and without informing him of his presence she moved aside so that he might see him. Although he saw him he continued eating as if he had not seen him. Visàkhà politely told the monk, “Pass on, Venerable, my father-in-law is eat- ing stale fare ( purànam ).” The ignorant millionaire misconstruing her words, was so provoked that he ordered the bowl to be removed and Visàkhà to be expelled from the house. Visàkhà was the favourite of all the inmates of the house, and so nobody dared to touch her. But Visàkhà, disciplined as she was, would not accept without protest such treatment even from her father-in-law. She politely said, “Father, this is no suffi cient reason why I should leave your house. I was not brought here by you like a slave girl from some ford. Daughters whose parents are alive do not leave like this. It is for this very reason that my father, when I set out to come here, summoned eight clansmen and entrusted me to them, saying, ‘If there be any fault in my daughter, investigate it.’ Send word to them and let them investigate my guilt or innocence.” The millionaire agreed to her reasonable proposal and summoning them, said, “At a time of festivity, while I was sitting and eating sweet milk rice-porridge from a golden bowl, this girl said that what I was eating was unclean. Convict her of this fault and expel her from the house.” Visàkhà proved her innocence stating, “That is not precisely what I said. When a certain Monk was standing at the door for alms, my father-in-law was eating sweet milk rice-porridge, ignoring him.

But the spiteful millionaire charged her again for having gone behind the house with male and female attendants in the middle watch of the night. When she explained that she actually did so in order to attend on a mare in travail, the clansmen remarked that their noble daughter had done an exemplary act which even a slave-girl would not do. She was thus acquitted of the second charge too. But the revengeful mil- lionaire would not rest until she was found guilty. Next time he found fault with her for no reason. He said that before her departure from home her father gave her ten admonitions. For instance, he said to her, “The indoor fi re is not to be taken out of doors. Is it really possible to live without giving fi re even to our neighbours on both sides of us?” questioned the millionaire. She availed herself of the opportunity to explain all the ten admonitions in detail to his entire satisfaction. The millionaire was silenced and he had no other charges to make. Having proved her innocence, self-respecting Visàkhà now desired to leave the house as she was ordered to do so in the fi rst place. The millionaire’s attitude towards Visàkhà was completely changed, and he was compelled to seek pardon from her daughter-in-law for what he had uttered through ignorance."},{"pageNumber":896,"pageContent":"214.

The Licchavis, whose capital was Vesàli – one of the greatest cities of India in the Buddha’s day – were a very proud dynasty. The following incident illustrates it. The Licchavis of Vesàli heard that the Buddha had come to Vesàli and was dwelling at the mango grove of Ambapàli. They got into a fl eet of valuable vehicles and proceeded towards the mango grove. Some of them were dark blue in complexion, and they were dressed in dark blue garments and decked in dark blue ornaments.

We have been beaten by this woman of the mango grove.” They, however, proceeded towards the mango grove, and the Buddha, seeing them at a distance, said to the fraternity of monks, “Those of you monks who have not seen gods of the Tàvatiüsa world may look at these Licchavi princes, and think of them as quite comparable to gods of the Tàvatiüsa.” The Licchavi princes got down from their vehicles, and walked up to the place where the Buddha was seated. They sat aside and listened to the admonition of the Buddha. Although they invited the Buddha and the fraternity of monks to alms next day, the Buddha said that He had already accepted an invitation to alms from Ambapàli.

Anitthigandha, we are told, passed from the World of Brahma and was reborn in Sàvatthi into a family possessed of great wealth. From the day of his birth he refused to go near a woman. When he reached manhood his mother and father said to him, “Son, we wish to arrange a marriage for you.” The youth replied, I have no use for a woman.” Time and again they asked him, and time and again he refused. Finally he caused fi ve hundred goldsmiths to make a solid image of beaten gold in the form of a woman of surpassing beauty and said to his parents, “If you will bring me such a maiden as that, I will do your bidding.” So saying, he pointed to the image of gold. So his mother and father summoned several noted Bràhmins and sent them forth, saying, “Our son pos- sesses great merit; there must certainly be a maiden who wrought works of merit with him. Take this image of gold with you, go abroad, and bring back with you a maiden of equal beauty.” “Agreed,” said the Bràhmins, and they trav- elled from place to place until they came to the city Sàgala in the kingdom of Madda. Now there lived in this city a certain maiden of about sixteen years of age, and she was exceedingly beautiful.

The mistress and master of the household exchanged friendly greetings with the Bràh- mins, and then caused their daughter to come down and stand on the lower fl oor of the palace beside the golden image. So great was the beauty of the maiden that the image no longer seemed beautiful. The Bràhmins gave them the image, took the maiden, and went to inform the mother and father of Anitthigandha Kumàra. Delighted at heart, they said to the Bràhmins, “Go fetch this maiden hither with all speed.” So saying, they were sent forth with rich offerings. When Anit- thigandha Kumàra heard the report he said, “Let them fetch the maiden hither with all speed.” The maiden entered a car- riage, but so delicate was she that as she was being conveyed along the road, the jolting of the carriage gave her cramps, and she died. When the death was reported to the youth, he exclaimed, “Alas, to think that I should have failed to meet so beautiful a woman!” Profound melancholy came over him, and he was overwhelmed with grief and pain. The Buddha, seeing that he was ripe for conversion, stopped at the door of his house on his round for alms. He was invited in for a meal by the youth’s parents.

Commentary Special Note : The story of Prince Anitthigandha has a remarkable similarity to the story of King Kusa. In this story though, unlike in the Kusa story, the prince is extremely handsome.

The story goes that this Bràhmin, who held false views, went one day to the bank of the river to clear his fi eld. The Buddha, seeing that he was ripe for conversion, went to him. The Bràhmin, although he saw the Buddha, paid him no mark of respect but remained silent. The Buddha was the fi rst to speak and said, “Bràhmin, what are you doing?” “Clearing my fi eld, Venerable.” The Buddha said no more and went on his way. On the following day, the Bràhmin went to plough his fi eld. The Buddha went to him and asked, “Bràhmin, what are you doing?” “Plowing my fi eld, Venerable.” The Buddha, hearing his reply, went on his way. On several days in succes- sion the Buddha went to the Bràhmin and asked the same question. Receiving the answers, “Venerable, I am planting my fi eld, I am weeding my fi eld, I am guarding my fi eld,” the Buddha went on his way. One day the Bràhmin said to the Buddha, “Venerable, you have been coming here ever since I cleared my fi eld. If my crop turns out well, I will divide it with you. I will not myself eat without giving to you. Hence- forth you shall be my partner.” As time went on, his crop fl ourished.

But a severe rainstorm raged that night and swept away his crops; the fi eld"},{"pageNumber":906,"pageContent":"906 looked as if it had been cut clean. The Buddha, however, knew from the very fi rst that his crop would not fl ourish. Early in the morning when the Bràhmin saw that the fi eld had been swept clean, he thought with deep grief, “The monk Gotama has visited this fi eld from the day when I fi rst cleared it, and I have said to him, ‘If this crop of mine turns out well, I will divide it with you. I will not myself eat without giving to you. Henceforth you shall be my partner.’ But the desire of my heart has not been fulfi lled.” And so he refused to eat and went to bed. Now the Buddha stopped at the door of his house. When the Bràhmin heard that the Buddha had arrived, he said, “Bring my partner in and give him a seat here.” His servants did so. When the Buddha had taken his seat, he asked, “What is the matter, Bràhmin?” “Venerable, you have visited me from the day when I fi rst cleared my fi eld, and I have said to you, ‘If my crop turns out well, I will divide it with you.’ But the desire of my heart has not been fulfi lled. Therefore, sorrow has come upon me, and my food no longer agrees with me.” Then the Buddha said to him, “But, Bràhmin, do you know what causes this sorrow that has come upon you?” “No, Venerable, that I do not know.

Craving is the chief root of suffering, and of the ever continuing cycle of rebirths. “What, O monk, is the origin of suf- fering? It is that craving which gives rise to fresh rebirth and, bound up with pleasure and lust, here and there, fi nds ever fresh delight. It is the sensual craving ( kàma-taõhà ), the craving for existence ( bhava- taõhà ), the craving for non-existence ( vibhava-taõhà ). Taõh à is the eighth link in the formula of the dependent origination ( paticca-samuppàda ). Corresponding to the six sense-objects, there are six kinds of craving: craving for visible objects, for sounds, odours, tastes, bod- ily impressions, mental impressions ( råpa-taõhà , sadda , gandha , rasa , phottabba , dhamma ). Corresponding to the three-fold existence, there are three kinds: craving for sensual existence ( kàma-taõhà ), for fi ne- material existence ( råpa ), for immaterial existence ( aråpa ). There are eighteen thought-channels of craving ( taõhà-vicarita ) induced internally, and eighteen induced externally; and as occurring in past, present and future, they total one hundred and eight. Accord- ing to the dependent origination, craving is conditioned by feeling. Of craving for existence ( bhava-taõhà ), it is said: “No fi rst beginning of the craving for existence can be perceived, O’ monks, before which it was not and after which it came to be. But it can be perceived that crav- ing for existence has its specifi c condition. I say, O’ monks, that also craving for existence has its condition that feeds it ( sàhàram ) and is not without it. And what is it? Ignorance, one has to reply.” Craving for existence and ignorance are called the outstanding causes that lead to happy and unhappy destinies (courses of existence)."},{"pageNumber":908,"pageContent":"217.

When they saw the Buddha, they saluted him and continued on their way without so much as saying to a single monk, “Have a cake.” When they had gone, the Buddha said to the monks, “Monks, would you not like to eat some cakes?” “Ven- erable, where are my cakes?” “Do you not see those youths passing by with baskets of cakes on their shoulders?” “Vener- able, such youths as they never give cakes to anybody.” “Monks, although these youths have not invited you or me to share their cakes, yet a monk, the owner of the cakes, follows in the rear. You must eat some cakes before you go on.” Now the Buddhas cherish no sentiments of ill-will or hatred towards any man; therefore the Buddha spoke thus. And hav- ing thus spoken, he went with the congregation of monks, and sat down at the foot of a certain tree in the shade. When the youths saw Venerable Mahà Kassapa follow- ing in the rear, they immediately took a liking to him. In fact, their bodies were pervaded with a thrill of pleasure at seeing him.

However, they turned around and went back to the elder, gave the elder the cakes, stood on one side watching him, and at the end of the repast, gave him water. The monks were offended and said, “These youths have shown favouritism in giving alms; they never asked either the Buddha or the chief elders to accept alms, but when they saw Venerable Mahà Kassapa, they took their baskets and went to offer him cakes.” The Buddha, hear- ing their words, said, “Monks, a monk like my son Mahà Kas- sapa is dear to deities and men alike; such a man they delight to honour with the four requisites.” Explanatory Translation (Verse 217) sãladassana sampannaü dhammaññhaü saccavàdinaü attano kamma kubbànaü taü jano piyaü kurute sãladassana sampannaü : endowed with discipline and insight; dhammaññhaü : well established in the dhamma; saccavàdinaü : truthful; attano : one’s own; kamma kub- bànaü : looking after activities; taü : that kind of being; jano : the masses; piyaü kurute : love (hold in affection) He is endowed with discipline and insight.

The Teachings of the Buddha rest fi rmly on the Four Noble Truths in which he has discovered as the eternal human condition. Truthfulness ( sacca ) is the seventh perfection. By sacca is here meant the fulfi llment of one’s promise. This is one of the salient characteristics of a Bodhisatta, for he is no breaker of his word. He acts as he speaks, he speaks as he acts ( yathàvàdi tathàkàri yathàkàri tathàvàdi ). According to the Hàrita Jàtaka a Bodhisatta, in the course of his life’s wanderings, never utters an untruth although at times he may violate the other four precepts. Truth he hides not, even to be polite. He makes truth his guide, and holds it his bounden duty to keep his word. He ponders well before he makes his promise, but once made the prom- ise is fulfi lled at any cost, even that of his life. In the Hiri Jàtaka the Bodhisatta advises: “Be thou in deed to every promise true, Refuse to promise what thou cannot do; Wise men on empty braggarts look askew.” Again, the Mahà Sutasoma Jàtaka recounts that to fulfi ll a prom- ise the Bodhisatta was prepared even to sacrifi ce his life. “Just as the morning star on high in balanced course doth ever keep, And through all seasons, times, and years, so likewise he in all wise speech swerves never from the path of truth.” A Bodhisatta is trustworthy, sincere and honest. What he thinks, he speaks. There is perfect harmony in his thoughts, words and deeds. He is consistent and straightforward in all his dealings. He is no hypo- crite since he strictly adheres to his high principles. There is no differ- ence between his inner self and his outward utterance. His private life accords with his public life. He does not use fl attery to win the hearts of others, does not exalt himself to win their admiration, does not hide his defects or vainly exhibit his virtues. The praiseworthy he praises without malice, the blameworthy he blames judiciously, not with contempt but out of compassion. (However, the truth he does not always utter.) Should such utterance not be conducive to the good and happiness of others, then he remains silent. If any truth seems benefi cial to others, he utters it, however detrimental to himself it may be.

He was all that his mother and father wished him to be, faithful, believing, a servitor of the Sangha. When he came of age, his mother and father desired that he should marry his maternal uncle’s daughter Revati, who lived in the house opposite. But Revati was an unbeliever and was not accustomed to giving alms, and therefore Nandiya did not wish to marry her. So Nandiya’s mother said to Revati, “Dear daughter, sweep the fl oor neatly and sweep in this house where the congregation of monks are to sit, prepare seats, set stands in their proper places, and when the monks arrive, take their bowls, invite them to sit down, and strain water for them with a straining-cup; when they have fi nished their meal, wash their bowls. If you will so do, you will win the favour of my son.” Revati did so. Nandiya’s mother said to her son, “Revati is now patient of admonition.” Nandiya then gave his consent, the day was set, and they were married. Said Nandiya to his wife, “If you will minister faithfully to the congregation of monks and to my mother and father, on this condition you will be privileged to dwell in this house; there- fore be heedful.” “Very well,” said Revati, promising to do so.

Nandiya, having come into great wealth on the death of his mother and father, established alms for the congregation of monks, and likewise established at the door of his house regular distribution of cooked food to poor folk and travellers. Somewhat later, after hearing the Buddha preach the Dhamma considering within himself the blessings which would accrue to him through the gift of a dwelling to the monks, he caused a quadruple hall, a four chambered hall to be erected and furnished at the Great Mon- astery of Isipatana. And having caused beds and couches to be spread, presented this dwelling to the congregation of monks presided over by the Buddha, giving alms, and pour- ing water of donation into the right hand of the Buddha. As the water of donation fell into the right hand of the Buddha, there arose in the world of the thirty-three a celestial mansion extending twelve leagues in all directions, a hundred leagues high, made of the seven kinds of jewels and fi lled with celes- tial nymphs. One day when Venerable Mahà Moggallàna went on a pilgrimage to the world of the deities, he stopped near this palace and asked some deities who approached him, “Through whose merit came into existence this celestial man- sion fi lled with a company of celestial nymphs?” Then those deities informed him who was lord of the mansion, saying, “Venerable, a householder’s son named Nandiya caused a monastery to be erected at Isipatana and gave it to the Buddha, and through his merit this celestial mansion came into exist-"},{"pageNumber":919,"pageContent":"919 ence.” Thereupon the company of celestial nymphs descended from that palace and said to the elder, “Venerable, we would be the slaves of Nandiya.

Sometimes, these ten moral actions are regarded as twelve by introducing sub-divisions to (7) and (10). Praising of others’ good actions ( pasamsà ) is added to rejoic- ing in others’ merit ( anumodanà ). Taking the Three Refuges ( sarana ) and mindfulness ( anussati ) are substituted for straightening of one’s views. Generosity yields wealth. Morality gives birth in noble families and in states of happiness. Meditation gives birth in realms of form and formless realms, and helps to gain higher knowledge and eman- cipation. Transference of merit acts as a cause to give in abundance in future births. Rejoicing in others’ merit is productive of joy wherever one is born. Both expounding and hearing the Dhamma are condu- cive to wisdom. Reverence is the cause of noble parentage. Service produces large retinue.

The Buddha indicated to Anàthapiõóika the various gradations of meritorious activities. Once, the Buddha, discoursing on generos- ity, reminded Anàthapiõóika that alms given to the Sangha together with the Buddha is very meritorious; but more meritorious than such alms is the building of a monastery for the use of the Sangha; more meritorious than such monasteries is seeking refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha; more meritorious than seeking refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha is the observance of fi ve precepts; more meritorious than such observance is meditation on loving-kindness ( Mettà ) for a moment; and most meritorious of all is the development of Insight as to the fl eeting nature of things ( vipassanà ). It is evident from this discourse that generosity is the fi rst stage on the way of Buddhist life. More important than generosity is the observance of at least the fi ve rules of regulated behaviour which tend to the disciplining of words and deeds. Still more important and more benefi cial is the cultivation of such ennobling virtues like loving-kindness which lead to self-development.

As explained by the Buddha, Rohini was, at one time, the chief queen of the king of Bàrànasi. It so happened that the king had a favourite dancer and the chief queen was very jealous of her. So the queen wanted to punish the dancer. Thus one day, she had her attendants put some itching powder in the dancer’s bed and blankets. Next, they called the dancer, and as though in jest, they threw some itching powder on her. The girl itched all over and was in great pain and discomfort. Thus itching unbearably, she ran to her room and her bed, which made her suffer even more. As a result of that evil deed Rohini had become a leper in this existence. The Buddha then exhorted the congregation not to act foolishly in anger and not to bear any ill will towards others. At the end of the discourse, many in the congregation attained sotàpatti fruition. Princess Rohini also attained sotàpatti fruition, and at the same time her skin disease disap- peared, and her complexion became fair, smooth and very attractive.

Of all emotions that affect a personality adversely, anger is the worst. Anger grows ten-fold if met with anger, but if met calmly it often ends quickly in a sense of shame which is stronger by contrast. It is the most illogical of all passions. At the moment of intense anger a man is no longer really human; he has become a destructive animal. Even anger at injustice done to others is not a state of mind which is conducive to a right solution. But in dealing with oneself, this mood of anger cannot outlast a calm analysis. Obviously, the two attitudes are antithetical, and at fi rst the anger, if already a habit, is likely to brush all else aside. But with practice, all things can be achieved, and we can look at ourselves and say, “Who is it that is annoyed? What is the cause of this anger? Anger soon subsides and often is forgotten in the interest of discovering the cause. Afterwards, conscious of having avoided the probably foolish action that would have followed if anger had taken its course, we are glad that we observed such self-control."},{"pageNumber":929,"pageContent":"222.

For after the Buddha had given permission to the con- gregation of monks to lodge outside the walls of the Monas- tery, and while the treasurer of Ràjagaha and others were busy providing such lodgings, a certain monk of âlavi decided to build himself a lodging, and seeing a tree which suited him, began to cut it down. Thereupon a certain spirit who had been reborn in that tree, and who had an infant child, appeared before the monk, carrying her child on her hips, and begged him not to cut down the tree, saying, “Master, do not cut down my home; it will be impossible for me to take my child and wander about without a home.” But the monk said, “I shall not be able to fi nd another tree like this,” and paid no further attention to what she said. The tree-spirit thought to herself, “If he but looks upon this child, he will desist,” and placed the child on a branch of the tree. The monk, however, had already swung his axe, was unable to check the force of his upraised axe, and cut off the arm of the child. Furious with anger, the tree-spirit raised both her hands and exclaimed, “I will strike him dead.” In an instant, however, the thought came to her, “This monk is a righteous man; if I kill him, I shall go to hell.

Besides, this monk has a master; I will therefore con- tent myself with reporting this matter to his master.” Lowering her upraised hands, she went weeping to the Buddha, and having saluted him, stood on one side. Said the Buddha, “What is the matter, tree-spirit?” The tree-spirit replied, “Venerable, your disciple did this and that to me. I was sorely tempted to kill him, but I thought this and that, refrained from killing him, and came here.” So saying, she told him the story in all its details. When the Buddha heard her story, he said to her, “Well done, well done, spirit! You have done well in holding in, like a swift-speeding chariot, your anger when it was thus aroused.” At the conclusion of the lesson the tree-spirit was estab- lished in the fruit of conversion; the assembled company also profi ted by it. But even after the tree-spirit had obtained the fruit of conversion, she stood weeping. The Buddha asked her, “What is the matter, tree-spirit?” “Venerable,” she replied, “my home has been destroyed; what am I to do now?” Said the Buddha, “Enough, tree-spirit; be not disturbed; I will give you a place of abode.” With these words he pointed out near the perfumed chamber of Jetavana a certain tree from which a tree-spirit had departed on the preceding day and said, “In such and such a place is a tree which stands by itself; enter therein.” Accordingly the tree-spirit entered that tree. Thence- forth, because the tree-spirit had received her place of abode as a gift from the Buddha, although spirits of great power approached that tree, they were unable to shake it. The Buddha used this occasion to enjoin upon the monks and lay down the observance of the precept regarding the injuring of plants and trees."},{"pageNumber":932,"pageContent":"932 Explanatory Translation (Verse 222) yo ve uppatitaü kodhaü bhantaü rathaü iva dhàraye taü ahaü sàrathiü bråmi itaro jano rasmiggàho yo : if a person; ve : certainly; uppatitaü kodhaü : arisen anger; bhantaü rathaü iva : like an uncontrolled chariot; dhàraye : restrains; taü : him; ahaü : I; sàrathiü bråmi : call a charioteer; itaro jano : the other (kind of charioteer); rasmiggàho : is a mere reins-holder That person who is capable of curbing sudden anger is like the expert charioteer who restrains a chariot rushing out of control.

Their tendency to become angry stems from a variety of sources. All men have suffered wrong treatment themselves, and all bear the scars. Many peo- ple have had their childhood marred and their characters warped. We are striving for health of mind ourselves from a similarly imperfect past. Health of mind will spread to others as readily as wrong thought. In any case, the Path can never be trodden to the goal until all such wrong atti- tudes of mind have been superseded, therefore, however often we fail, let us freely admit the failure and go on striving. Certain creatures cannot see in the day time whilst some others are blind at night. But a man driven to great heights of hatred does not observe anything, either by day or night. Buddha says: “Conquer anger by love, evil by good, the miserly by generosity and the liar by truth.” With whom and with what do you fi ght when you are angry. You fi ght with yourself, for you are the worst enemy of yourself. Mind is your best friend and worst foe.

Uttarà was the daughter of a farm labourer named Pu¤¤a and his wife. Pu¤¤a worked for a rich man named Sumana, in Ràjagaha. One day, Pu¤¤a and his wife offered alms-food to Venerable Sàriputta soon after his arising from sustained deep mental absorption ( nirodha samàpatti ), and as a result of that good deed they suddenly became very rich. Pu¤¤a came upon gold in the fi eld he was ploughing, and the king offi cially declared him a royal banker. On one occasion, the family of Pu¤¤a offered alms-food to the Buddha and the monks for seven days, and on the seventh day, after hearing the Buddha’s discourse, all the three members of the family attained sotàpatti fruition. Later, Uttarà, the daughter of Pu¤¤a, married the son of the rich man Sumana. That family being non-Buddhist, Uttarà did not feel happy in her husband’s home. So, she told her father, “My father, why have you put me in this cage? Here, I do not see any monk and I have no chance to offer anything to any monk.” Her father felt sorry for her and sent her fi fteen thousand in cash. With this money, after getting permission from her husband, Uttarà engaged a courtesan to look to the needs of her husband.

Being unable to control herself, Sirimà went into the kitchen and got a ladleful of boiling butter with the intention of pouring it over the head of Uttarà. Uttarà saw her coming, but she bore no ill will towards Sirimà. She refl ected that because Sirimà had stood in for her, she had been able to listen to the dhamma, make offerings of alms-food for fi fteen days, and perform other acts of charity. Thus she was quite thankful to Sirimà. Suddenly, she realized that Sirimà had come very close to her and was going to pour boiling-hot butter over her; so she made this asseveration: “If I bear any ill will towards Sirimà may this boiling-hot butter burn me; if I have no ill will towards her may it not burn me.” The boiling-hot butter did not harm her a bit. Sirimà then expressed her wish to see the Buddha. So it was arranged that Sirimà should offer alms-food to the Buddha and the monks on the following day at the house of Uttarà. After the meal, the Buddha was told everything that had happened between Sirimà and Uttarà.

Once, Venerable Mahà Moggallàna visited the deva world and found many devas living in luxurious mansions.

One of them was reborn in the deva world not because he gave away much wealth in charity or because he had listened to the Dhamma, but just because he always spoke the truth.

Krodha (anger) is the harshness that arises in some minds. The feeling of anger tends to fl uctuate, espe- cially as it escalates through a variety of stages. The process of desta- bilization of a human being that comes about with the onset of anger, escalates from an initial disturbance of mind until it climaxes in the disastrous use of weapons. This kind of anger may, at times, end with loss of life – either one’s own or someone else’s.

Commentary accutaü ñhànaü : the unchanging place. This is yet another defi nition of Nibbàna – the deathless. Everything changes – but this rule does not apply to Nibbàna. In contra-distinction to saüsàra , the phenomenal exist- ence, Nibbàna is eternal ( dhuva ), desirable ( subha ), and happy ( sukha ). According to Buddhism all things, mundane and supramundane, are classifi ed into two divisions, namely, those conditioned by causes ( samkhata ) and those not conditioned by any cause ( asamkhata ). “These three are the features of all conditioned things ( samkhatalakkhanàni ): aris- ing ( uppàda ), cessation ( vaya ), and change of state ( thitassa a¤¤ataññam ).” Arising or becoming is an essential characteristic of everything that is conditioned by a cause or causes. That which arises or becomes is subject to change and dissolution. Every conditioned thing is constantly becom- ing and is perpetually changing. The universal law of change applies to everything in the cosmos – both mental and physical – ranging from the minutest germ or tiniest particle to the highest being or the most massive object. Mind, though imperceptible, changes faster even than matter. Nibbàna, a supramundane state, realized by Buddhas and arahats, is declared to be not conditioned by any cause. Hence it is not subject to any becoming, change and dissolution. It is birthless ( ajàta ), decayless ( ajara ), and deathless ( amara ). Strictly speaking, Nibbàna is neither a cause nor an effect. Hence it is unique ( kevala ). Everything that has sprung from a cause must inevitably pass away, and as such, is undesirable ( asubha )."},{"pageNumber":944,"pageContent":"944 Life is man’s dearest possession, but when he is confronted with insuperable diffi culties and unbearable burdens, then that very life becomes an intolerable burden. Sometimes, he tries to seek relief by putting an end to his life as if suicide would solve all his individual prob- lems. Bodies are adorned and adored. But those charming, adorable and enticing forms, when disfi gured by time and disease, become extremely repulsive. Men desire to live peacefully and happily with their near ones, surrounded by amusements and pleasures, but, if by some misfortune, the wicked world runs counter to their ambitions and desires, the inevi- table sorrow is then almost indescribably sharp. The following beautiful parable aptly illustrates the fl eeting nature of life and its alluring pleasures. A man was forcing his way through a thick forest beset with thorns and stones. Suddenly, to his great consterna- tion, an elephant appeared and gave chase. He took to his heels through fear, and, seeing a well, he ran to hide in it. But to his horror, he saw a viper at the bottom of the well. However, lacking other means of escape, he jumped into the well, and clung to a thorny creeper that was growing in it. Looking up, he saw two mice, a white one and a black one, gnawing at the creeper. Over his face there was a beehive from which occasional drops of honey trickled. This man, foolishly unmindful of this precarious position, was greedily tasting the honey. A kind person volunteered to show him a path of escape. But the greedy man begged to be excused ’till he had enjoyed himself. The thorny path is saüsàra , the ocean of life. It is beset with dif- fi culties and obstacles to overcome, with opposition and unjust criticism, with attacks and insults to be borne. Such is the thorny path of life. The elephant here resembles death; the viper, old age; the creeper, birth; the two mice, night and day. The drops of honey correspond to the fl eeting sensual pleasures. The man represents the so-called being. The kind person represents the Buddha. The temporary material happiness is merely the gratifi cation of some desire. When the desired thing is gained, another desire arises. Insatiate are all desires. Sorrow is essential to life, and cannot be evaded. Nibbàna, being non-conditioned, is eternal, ( dhuva ), desirable ( subha ), and happy ( sukha ). The happiness of Nibbàna should be differentiated from ordinary worldly happiness. Nibbàna bliss grows neither stale nor monotonous. It is a form of happiness that never wearies, never fl uctuates. It arises by allaying passions ( våpasama ) unlike that temporary worldly happiness which results from the gratifi cation of some desire ( vedayita )."},{"pageNumber":945,"pageContent":"226.

Commentary The Buddha ’ s Routine : In the course of His long mission, the Buddha followed a routine with the intention of looking after the spiritual welfare of the many in the most supreme manner possible. He met a variety of persons such as kings, ministers, men of business, trad- ers and men and women who could be described as ordinary. He expounded the Dhamma according to the need and the capacity of those persons he met, as in the instance of Atula in these verses. How he spent his days is recounted in Buddhist literature at some length. During the fi rst twenty years of His ministry, the Buddha spent the rainy seasons at the following places: 1st — Isipatana in Benàres; 2nd — Veluvana in Ràjagaha; 3rd — Veluvana in Ràjagaha; 4th — Veluvana in Ràjagaha; 5th — Mahàvana in Vesàli, at the Great Hall; 6th — Mankula Pabbata; 7th — Tàvatimsa heaven; 8th — Bhesakàla Vana near Suüsumàra Giri in Bhagga District; 9th — Kosambi; 10th — Pàrileyyaka forest; 11th — Nàla, a bràhmin village; 12th — Veranjà;"},{"pageNumber":957,"pageContent":"230.

From the twenty-fi rst year of His ministry, the Buddha spent the rainy seasons ( vassa ) until His last year at the Jetavana Monastery and the Pubbàràma Monastery in Sàvatthi, due to the great virtues of Anàthapiõóika and Visàkhà, the respective donors of the two places. The last year was spent at Vesàli. When the Buddha spent the night at Jetavana the next morning He would, in the company of the fraternity of monks, enter the City of Sàvatthi from the southern gate for the alms-round and depart from the eastern gate. Then He would enter the Pubbàràma to spend the day. When the night was spent at the Pubbàràma, the Buddha would, next morning, enter the city through the eastern gate for His alms-round and depart from the southern gate to spend the day at the Jetavana Monastery. As for the Buddha, He had no fruitless pursuit, for such fruit- less pursuits, if any, were over with the attainment of enlightenment at the foot of the Bodhi-tree. So the day was divided by the Buddha into fi ve parts for His activities, namely, the morning, the afternoon, the fi rst watch of the night, the second watch of the night, and the last watch of the night. The Buddha rose early in the morning and attended to His bodily needs, such as washing His face. He waited in retirement until the time to go on the alms-round and when it was time to go out He would put on robes and belt and, taking the bowl, would set out from the monastery to a village or a suburb. Sometimes, the Buddha went alone and sometimes He was accompanied by monks. Some days the journey was ordinary."},{"pageNumber":959,"pageContent":"959 Thus, in front of the Buddha there were fragrant breezes and clouds came down as mist to stop the rising of dust, and sometimes to form canopies. The road was strewn with fl owers by the winds. Eleva- tions and depressions of the road were levelled up for the comfort of the feet of the Buddha. As the Buddha set his right foot in the city, six rays would emanated from His body, pervading the city and illuminating the mansions and other buildings. Elephants, horses, and birds sent forth sweet sounds. Melodious notes issue forth from musical instruments such as drums and fl utes, and from the ornaments of the people. By those signs the people come to know of the arrival of the Buddha, and they dressed themselves well, and came out on to the streets from their houses with fl owers and perfumes in hand. They gave their respect to the Buddha and asked for a certain number of monks – such as ten, twenty or a hundred – to be treated. They would take the bowl of the Buddha and conduct Him to a seat and offer alms. After the meal, the Buddha preached to them the doctrine according to the respective states of mind of the people. Some of them took refuge in the Triple Gem; some people observed the Five Pre- cepts; and others reached the different higher paths. Some entered the Sangha and attained sanctifi cation. Then the Buddha went back to the monastery and sat on the seat prepared for Him. Until the monks fi nished taking their meals, the Buddha would wait in the perfumed chamber. This was His daily routine for the morning. After entering the perfumed chamber, the Buddha would wash His feet and, standing on the stage at the gem-set staircase, would admonish the monks thus: “Monks, provide for your salvation ear- nestly. Rare is the birth of a Buddha in this world; rare is birth as a human being; rare is birth as an accomplished man; rare is ordination; and rare is the opportunity to learn the doctrine.” Some monks asked for meditation topics.

All the monks saluted"},{"pageNumber":960,"pageContent":"960 the Buddha and proceeded to their respective places of stay for the day and for the night. Some went to the forest. Some went to the feet of trees. Some went to mountains, and there are some who went to deva worlds. The Buddha remained in the perfumed chamber, and if He wished He would lie down for a while on His right side in the pose of a lion, conscious and mindful. After the body was relaxed He would get up and survey the world. The people who offered alms in the morning would outfi t themselves neatly, and come to the monastery with fl owers and perfumes. The Buddha would go to the preaching hall and preach a discourse to suit the time and the occasion. After the discourse was over, the audience would salute the Buddha and depart. Thus was the Buddha’s afternoon. When the teaching in the afternoon was over, if the Buddha wished to bathe, He would enter the bath room and wash His body with water supplied by an attendant. Then the attendant would pre- pare the seat of the Buddha in His study in the perfumed chamber. The Buddha would dress Himself in a red robe, and occupy the seat. There He would remain in silence for a moment, before the monks came to Him with their problems. Some of them asked questions; some asked for meditation topics; some wished to hear a discourse, and the Buddha would comply with their requests. Thus was spent the fi rst watch of the night. After the monks took leave of the Buddha in the middle watch of the night, the deities of the universes came to the Buddha and asked questions according to their needs, with some asking even questions of four lines. The Buddha spent the middle watch of the night answer- ing their questions and solving their riddles. The last watch of the night is divided into three. In the fi rst part, the Buddha relaxed by walking up and down. In the second part, He lay down in the perfumed chamber, conscious and mindful in the pose of a lion. In the last part of the last watch of the night the Buddha would sit up and survey the world with the awakened eye to see the individuals who had accomplished meritorious acts such as morality and charity during the times of the earlier Buddhas."},{"pageNumber":961,"pageContent":"231.

These stanzas were spo- ken by the Buddha to admonish a group of six monks whose behaviour was not in keeping with the discipline of monks. The Buddha asked them to guard themselves against misdeeds. The Buddhist system lays down strict rules to ensure that monks restrain themselves duly. If monks are to attain the higher stages of spiritual progress regu- lated behaviour is essential. These elementary principles of regulated behaviour are essential to one who treads the path to Nibbàna, chiefl y because they tend to control both deeds and words. Violation of them introduces obstacles that hinder moral progress on the path. Observ- ance of them means smooth and steady progress along the path.

A life of celibacy is rec- ommended, as one’s valuable energy thus conserved could then be utilised wholly for the intellectual and moral welfare of oneself and others. In such a life one is detached from additional worldly bonds that impede moral progress. Almost all spiritual teachers, it would appear, have nourished their bodies sparingly and have led a life of strict celibacy, simplicity, voluntary poverty, and self-control. While he progresses slowly and steadily, with regulated word and deed and sense-restraint, the kammic force of the striving aspirant compels him to renounce worldly pleasures and adopt the ascetic life. To him then, comes the idea that: A den of strife is household life, And fi lled with toil and need, But free and high as the open sky Is the life the homeless lead. Thus realizing the vanity of sensual pleasures, he voluntarily forsakes all earthly possessions, and donning the ascetic garb tries to lead a sagely life. It is not, however, the external appearance that makes a man holy but internal purifi cation and an exemplary life. Transforma- tion should come from within, not from without. It is not absolutely necessary to retire to solitude and lead the life of an ascetic to realize Nibbàna. The life of a monk no doubt expedites and facilitates spir- itual progress, but even as a layman sainthood may be attained. He who attains arahatship as a layman in the face of all temptations is certainly more praiseworthy than a monk who attains arahatship liv- ing amidst surrounds that are not distracting. Concerning a minister who attained arahatship while decked in his best apparel and seated on an elephant, the Buddha remarked: Even though a man be richly adorned, if he walks in peace, If he be quiet, subdued, certain and pure, And if he refrains from injuring any living being, That man is a Bràhmin, that man is a hermit, that man is a monk."},{"pageNumber":969,"pageContent":"969 There have been several such instances of laymen who realized Nib- bàna without renouncing the world. The most devout and generous lay-follower Anàthapiõóika was a sotàpanna , the Sàkya Mahànàma was a sakadàgàmi , the potter Ghatãkàra was an anàgàmi and King Sud- dhodana, the Buddha’s father, died as an arahat . A monk is expected to observe the four kinds of higher morality – namely: Pàtimokkha sãla — The Fundamental moral code, Indriyasamvara sãla — Morality pertaining to sense-restraint, âjãvapàrisuddhi sãla — Morality pertaining to purity of livelihood, Paccayasannissita sãla — Morality pertaining to the use of the necessaries of life. These four kinds of morality are collectively called sãla-visuddhi (purity of virtue), the fi rst of the seven stages of purity on the way to Nibbàna. When a person enters the order and receives his higher ordination ( upasampadà ), he is called a bhikkhu . There is no English equivalent that exactly conveys the meaning of this Pàli term bhikkhu . Mendicant monk may be suggested as the nearest translation, not in the sense of one who is begging but as one who lives on alms. There are no vows for a monk. Of his own accord he becomes a monk to lead a religious life. He is at liberty to leave the Sangha. A monk is bound to observe 227 rules laid out in the Vinaya, apart from several other minor ones. The four major rules which deal with perfect celibacy, stealing, murder, and false claims to higher spiritual powers, must be strictly observed. If he violates any one of them, he becomes defeated ( pàràjikà ) and automatically ceases to be a monk. If he wishes, he can re-enter the Sangha and remain as a sàmanera (novice). In the case of other rules which he violates, he has to make amends according to the gravity of the offence. Among the salient characteristics of a monk are purity, perfect celibacy, voluntary pov- erty, humility, simplicity, selfl ess service, self-control, patience, com- passion, and harmlessness."},{"pageNumber":970,"pageContent":"970 The life of a monk or, in other words, renunciation of worldly pleasures and ambitions, is only an effective means to attain Nibbàna, but is not an end in itself. Securing a fi rm footing on the ground of morality, the aspir- ant then embarks upon the higher practice of samàdhi , the control and culture of the mind, the second stage of the path of purity. Samàdhi is equilibrium of the mind. It is stillness of the mind or the resting of mental activity. According to Buddhism, there are forty meditation topics ( kammaññhàna ) which differ according to the temperaments of individuals. They are: (1) The ten expansions ( kasinas ), namely: (a) earth kasina , (b) water kasina , (c) fi re kasina , (d) air kasina , (e) blue kasina , (f) yellow kasina , (g) red kasina , (h) white kasina , (i) light kasina and (j) space kasina . (2) The ten disagreeables ( asubha ), namely ten corpses which are respectively: (a) bloated ( uddhumàtaka ), (b) discoloured ( vinãlaka ), (c) festering ( vipubbaka ), (d) dissected ( vicchiddaka ), (e) gnawed- to-pieces ( vikkhàyitaka ), (f) scattered-in-pieces ( vikkhittaka ), (g) mutilated and scattered-in-pieces ( hatavikkhittaka ), (h) bloody ( lohitaka ), (i) worm-infested ( pulavaka ), and (j) skeletal ( aññhika ). (3) The ten refl ections ( anussati ), namely, eight refl ections on: (a) the Buddha ( Buddhànussati ), (b) the Doctrine ( Dhammànussati ), (c) the Sangha ( Sanghànussati ), (d) virtue ( selànussati ), (e) liberality ( càgànussati ), (f) devas ( devàtànussati ), (g) peace ( upasamànussati ), (h) death ( maranànussati ), respectively, together with (i) mindfulness regarding the body ( kàyagatàsati ) and (j) mindfulness regarding respiration ( ànàpànasati ). (4) The four immeasurables or the four modes of divine conduct ( bràhmavihàra ), namely, loving-kindness ( mettà ), compassion ( karunà ), appreciative joy ( mudità ), and equanimity ( upekkhà ). (5) The one perception, i.e., the perception of the loathsomeness of material food ( àhàre patikkiålasa¤¤à )."},{"pageNumber":971,"pageContent":"971 (6) The one analysis, i.e., the analysis of the four elements ( catudhàtuvivatthàna ). (7) The four aråpa jhànas , namely, the realm of the infi nity of space ( akàsàna¤càyatana ), the realm of the infi nity of consciousness ( vi¤¤àna¤càyatana ), and the realm of neither perception nor non- perception ( n ’ eva sa¤¤à n ’ àsa¤¤àyatana ). According to the texts, the ten impurities and the mindfulness regard- ing the body such as the thirty-two parts are suitable for those of a lustful temperament, because they tend to create a disgust for the body which fascinates the senses. The four illimitables and the four coloured kasinas are suitable for those of a hateful temperament. The refl ections on the Buddha and so forth are suitable for those of a devout temperament. The refl ec- tions on death and peace, perception on the loathsomeness of material food, and analysis of the four elements are suitable for those of an intellectual temperament. The remaining objects, chiefl y refl ection on the Buddha, meditation on loving-kindness, mindfulness regarding the body and refl ection on death, are suitable for all, irrespective of temperament. There are six kinds of temperaments ( carita ). They are: (1) Lustful temperament ( ràgacarita ), (2) Hateful temperament ( dosacarita ), (3) Ignorant temperament ( mohacarita ), (4) Devout temperament ( saddhàcarita ), (5) Intellectual temperament ( buddhicarita ), and (6) Discursive temperament ( vitakkacarita ). Carita signifi es the intrinsic nature of a person which is revealed when one is in a normal state without being preoccupied with anything. The temperaments of people differ owing to the diversity of their actions or kamma . Habitual actions tend to form particular temperaments."},{"pageNumber":972,"pageContent":"972 Ràga or lust is predominant in some, and dosa or anger, hatred, ill-will, in others. Most people belong to these two categories. There are a few others who lack intelligence and are more or less ignorant ( mohacarita ). Akin to the ignorant are those whose minds oscillate – unable to focus their attention deliberately on one thing ( vitakkacarita ). By nature some are exceptionally devout ( saddhàcarita ), while others are exceptionally intelligent ( buddhicarita ). Combining these six with one another, we get sixty-three types. With the inclusion of speculative temperament ( diññhicarita ) there are sixty-four types. The subjects of meditation are variously adapted to these different temperaments and types of people. Before practicing Samàdhi, the qualifi ed aspirant should give careful consideration to the subject of meditation. In ancient days it was customary for pupils to seek the guidance of a competent teacher to choose a suitable subject according to their temperaments. But today, if no competent teacher is available the aspirant must exercise his own judgement and choose one he thinks most suited to his character. When the subject has been chosen, he should withdraw to a quiet place where there are the fewest distractions. The forest, a cave, or any lonely place is most desirable, for there one is least liable to interruption during the practice. It should be understood that solitude is within us all. If our minds are not settled, even a quiet forest would not be a congenial place. But if our minds are settled, even the heart of a busy town may be congenial. The atmosphere in which we live acts as an indirect aid to tranquillize our minds. Next to be decided by the aspirant is the most convenient time when he himself, and his surroundings, are in the best possible condition for the practice. Early in the morning, when the mind is fresh and active, or before bedtime, if one is not overtired, is generally the most appropri- ate time for meditation. But whatever the time selected it is advisable to keep to that particular hour daily, for our minds then become con- ditioned to the practice."},{"pageNumber":973,"pageContent":"973 The meditating posture, too, serves as a powerful aid to con- centration. Meditators generally sit cross-legged, with the body erect. They sit placing the right foot on the left thigh and the left foot on the right thigh. This is the full position. If this posture is diffi cult, as it certainly is to many, the half position may be adopted, that is, simply placing the right foot on the left thigh or the left foot on the right thigh. When this triangular position is assumed, the whole body is well balanced. The right hand should be placed on the left hand, the neck straightened so that the nose is in a perpendicular line with the navel, the tongue should rest on the upper palate. The belt should be loosened, and clothes neatly adjusted. Some prefer closed eyes so as to shut out all unnecessary light and external sights. Although there are certain advantages in closing the eyes, it is not always recommended as it tends to drowsiness. Then the mind gets out of control and wanders aimlessly, vagrant thoughts arise, the body loses its erectness, quite unconsciously the mouth opens itself, saliva dribbles, and the head nods. The Buddha usually sat with half closed eyes looking through the tip of the nose and not more than a distance of four feet away. Those who fi nd the cross-legged posture too diffi cult may sit comfortably in a chair or any other support, suffi ciently high to rest the feet on the ground. It is of no great importance what posture one adopts provided it is easy and relaxed. The aspirant who is striving to gain one-pointedness of the mind should endeavour to control any unwholesome thoughts at their very inception.

It is neither pessimism nor optimism but realism. It is neither absolutely this-worldly nor other-worldly. It is not extrovert but introvert. It is not theo-centric but ego-centric. It is a unique Path of Enlightenment.

At Sàvatthi, so we are told, lived a certain butcher. He would kill cows, select the choicest portions of their fl esh for his own table, cause the same to be cooked, and then sit down with son and wife and eat the same; the rest he sold for a price. For fi fty-fi ve years he kept up this practice of killing cows. During all this time, although the Buddha resided at a neigh- bouring monastery, on no occasion did he give the Buddha so much as a spoonful of rice-gruel or boiled rice by way of alms. If he had meat to eat, he never ate rice. One day while it was still light, after selling some beef, he gave his wife a piece of beef to cook for his supper, and then went to the pool to bathe. While he was absent, a friend of his came to the house and said to his wife, “Let me have a little of the beef which your husband has for sale; a guest has come to my house.” “We have no beef for sale. Your friend has sold all his beef and has gone to the pool to bathe.” “Do not refuse my request; if you have a piece of beef in the house, give it to me.” “There is not a piece of beef in the house, except a piece which your friend has set aside for his own supper, and as he will not eat unless he can have meat to eat, he will certainly not give you this piece of beef.” But he took the piece of beef and went off with it."},{"pageNumber":978,"pageContent":"978 After the butcher had bathed, he returned home. When his wife set before him rice which she had boiled for him, sea- soned with leaves of her own cooking, he said to her, “Where is the meat?” “Husband, there is none.” “Did I not give you meat to cook before I left the house?” “A friend of yours came to the house and said to me, ‘A guest has come to my house; let me have a little of the beef which you have for sale.’ I said to him, ‘There is not a piece of beef in the house, except a piece which your friend has set aside for his own supper, and he will not eat unless he can have meat to eat.’ But in spite of what I said to him, he took the piece of beef himself and went off with it.” “Unless I have meat to eat with it, I will not eat rice; take it away.” “What is to be done, husband? Pray eat the rice.” “That I will not.” Having caused his wife to remove the rice, he took a knife in his hand and left the house. Now an ox was tethered in the rear of his house. The man went up to the ox, thrust his hand into the mouth of the ox, jerked out his tongue, cut it off at the root with his knife, and returned to the house with it. Having had it cooked on a bed of coals, he placed it on the boiled rice and sat down to eat his supper. He fi rst ate a mouthful of rice, and then placed a piece of meat in his mouth. That very moment his own tongue was cleft in twain and fell out of his mouth into the dish of rice. That very moment he received retribution similar in kind to the sin which he had committed. With a stream of blood fl owing from his mouth, he entered the court of his house and crawled about on his hands and knees, bellowing just like an ox. At this time his son stood close by, watching his father. His mother said to him, “Son, behold this butcher crawling about the court of the house on his hands and knees, bellow- ing like an ox. This punishment is likely to fall upon your"},{"pageNumber":979,"pageContent":"979 own head. Pay no attention to me, but seek safety in fl ight.” The son, terrifi ed by the fear of death, bade farewell to his mother and fl ed. Having made good his escape, he went to Takkasilà. As for the cow-killer, after he had crawled about the court of the house for a time, bellowing like an ox, he died, and was reborn in the Avãci Hell. The ox also died. Having gone to Takkasilà, the butcher’s son became apprenticed to a goldsmith. One day his master, as he set out for the village, said to him, “You are to make such and such an ornament.” So saying, his master departed. The apprentice made the ornament according to the directions he received. When his master returned and looked at the ornament, he thought to himself, “No matter where this youth may go, he will be able to earn his living anywhere.” So when the appren- tice came of age, the goldsmith gave him his daughter in mar- riage. He increased with sons and daughters. When his sons came of age, they acquired the various arts and subsequently going to Sàvatthi to live, established households of their own, and became faithful followers of the Buddha. Their father remained in Takkasilà, spent his days without performing a single work of merit, and fi nally reached old age. His sons thought to themselves, “Our father is now an old man,” and sent for him to come and live with them. Then they thought to themselves, “Let us give alms on behalf of our father.” Accordingly they invited the congrega- tion of monks presided over by the Buddha to take a meal with them. On the following day they provided seats in their house for the congregation of Monks presided over by the Buddha, served them with food, showing them every atten- tion, and at the conclusion of the meal said to the Buddha, “Venerable, this food which we have presented to you is the"},{"pageNumber":980,"pageContent":"980 food whereby our father lives; render thanks therefore to our father.” The Buddha thereupon addressed him and said, “Lay disciple, you are an old man. Your body has ripened and is like a withered leaf. You have no good works to serve as pro- visions for the journey to the world beyond. Make for yourself a refuge. Be wise; be not a simpleton.” Thus spoke the Buddha, pronouncing the words of thanksgiving.

These stanzas have the death theme as their central focus. The need to be aware that life will end is embodied in these stanzas. The Buddha admonishes the aged person to be aware of the possibility of death and accommodate provision to end suffering. This, in effect, is an effort to make him alert and mindful to the ever present threat of death. In the Buddhist system of meditation, the aware- ness of death, and being mindful of it, form a crucial fi eld of meditation. A practical guide to this meditative contemplation of death is an essen- tial for all. This form of meditation is maraõànussati bhàvanà – meditation on being mindful of death. Maraõànussati means the constant refl ection on death. The form of meditation that one practises while refl ecting on death is called maraõànussati bhàvanà . Like the sun which moves on without a stop from sunrise to sunset, the life of all beings of this world, too, goes on from birth to death. There is no one who is immortal in this world. The life of a being is as impermanent as a drop of dew at the end of a blade of grass at dawn. It is as evanescent as a line drawn on water or a bubble on the surface of water. Life comes to an end with death dur- ing any of the states – childhood, youth or old age. Death is a legacy that all beings, be they humans, animals, dei- ties or brahmas, have acquired. It is the very nature of this world that whatever comes into existence should someday cease to be. This imper- manence, characterized by coming into being and cessation, is common to all animate and inanimate objects of the world. We should bear in mind the fact that trees, mountains, rivers, cit- ies, oceans, the sun and the moon, machinery and other equipment – all these are subject to change and decay. All beings of the world have to confront a three-fold fear someday or other, namely, old age ( jarà ), dis- ease ( vyàdhi ) and death ( maraõa ). It is not possible to ward off these fears by such factors as wealth, position, power or learning. Therefore, we cannot consider life as something satisfactory or comfortable."},{"pageNumber":985,"pageContent":"238.

Stainless, free from death and decay."},{"pageNumber":986,"pageContent":"986 A person who does not think of death cannot grasp the imperma- nent nature of life. The mind of such a person is susceptible to evil and dan- gerous thoughts such as enmity, revenge, avarice, selfi shness and excessive pride. The practice of maraõànussati bhàvanà is of immense help to ward off the above-mentioned evil thoughts and to cultivate such virtues as kind- ness, sympathetic joy, honesty, equality, non-violence and generosity. The Buddha has shown us that there are three divine messengers in society who teach us three important lessons. They are the old, the diseased and the dead. We meet these messengers frequently. When you see someone who is disabled through old age, refl ect on the fact that you yourself will be subject to such a state someday; when you see a sick person, think of the possibility of being diseased yourself, when you attend a funeral or when you see a dead body or hear of a death, refl ect on the fact that you too will die someday. By doing so you will neces- sarily begin to honour elders, help the poor and the affl icted and lead a virtuous life. Furthermore, it will help you to lead a life of comfort and solace by giving up the pride that arises out of wealth, position, power clan, learning and youth. By practicing the maraõànussati bhàvanà daily you could gradually get rid of the fear of death. Furthermore, you will not be struck with excessive grief even at the death of your parents, brothers, sisters or other loved ones. This fact becomes clear from the ancient stories of Mal- likà, Patàcàrà and Kisàgotamã or from the Jàtaka stories like the Uraga Jàtaka . Therefore, always consider the great benefi ts you would gain by the practice of maraõànussati meditation. Before you commence the practice of maraõànussati bhàvanà , you should clean yourself, make offerings of fl owers, etc., and seek refuge in the Triple Gem and observe the fi vefold precepts, as mentioned earlier in the case of the other types of meditation. Thereafter, be seated in a suitable posture in a place conducive to meditation. Now, you should commence the practice of meditation by refl ecting on the following facts again and again. (1) I am subject to old age, disease and death. Like me, all beings of the world are subject to old age disease and death. Now you can go into the second stage, by refl ecting on the following, again and again, from beginning to end:"},{"pageNumber":987,"pageContent":"987 (2) My life is impermanent. Death is certain.

(10) The life of all beings in this world is impermanent. Their death is certain. They are subject to old age, disease and death. When you practice this meditation for a long period, your body, words and mind will become pure. You will not be the cause of any harm to society. Your actions, words and thoughts will be for the benefi t of all. The life of a person who practises this meditation constantly will indeed be a happy one and he will be able to face death without any fear whatsoever. Furthermore, it will help him to obtain the comforts of gods and men in the next world and to attain Nibbàna in the end. To the average man, death is by no means a pleasant subject for talk or discussion. It is something dismal and oppressive – a veritable kill-joy, a fi t topic for a funeral house only. The average man, immersed as he is in the self, ever seeking after the pleasurable, ever pursuing that which excites and gratifi es the senses, refuses to pause and ponder seri- ously that these very objects of pleasure and gratifi cation will some day reach their end. If wise counsel does not prevail and urge the unthink-"},{"pageNumber":988,"pageContent":"988 ing, pleasure-seeking man, to consider seriously that death can knock at his door also, it is only the shock of a bereavement under his own roof, the sudden and untimely death of a parent, wife or child that will rouse him up from his delirious round of sense-gratifi cation and rudely awaken him to the hard facts of life. Then only will his eyes open, then only will he begin to ask himself why there is such a phenomenon as death. Why is it inevitable? Why are there these painful partings which rob life of its joys? To most of us, at some moment or another, the spectacle of death must have given rise to the deepest of thoughts and profoundest of questions. What is life worth, if able bodies that once performed great deeds now lie fl at and cold, senseless and lifeless? What is life worth, if eyes that once sparkled with joy, eyes that once beamed with love are now closed forever, bereft of movement, bereft of life? Thoughts such as these are not to be repressed. It is just these inquiring thoughts, if wisely pursued, that will ultimately unfold the potentialities inherent in the human mind to receive the highest truth. According to the Buddhist way of thinking, death, far from being a subject to be shunned and avoided, is the key that unlocks the seeming mystery of life. It is by understanding death that we understand life; for death is part of the process of life in the larger sense. In another sense, life and death are two ends of the same process, and if you understand one end of the process, you also understand the other end. Hence by understanding the purpose of death, we also understand the purpose of life. It is the contemplation of death, the intensive thought that it will someday come upon us, that softens the hardest of hearts, binds one to another with cords of love and compassion, and destroys the barriers of caste, creed and race among the peoples of this earth, all of whom are subject to the common destiny of death. Death is a great leveller. Pride of birth, pride of position, pride of wealth, pride of power must give way to the all-consuming thought of inevitable death. It is this levelling aspect of death that made the poet say: Sceptre and crown Must tumble down And in the dust be equal made With the poor crooked scythe and spade."},{"pageNumber":989,"pageContent":"989 It is the contemplation of death that helps to destroy the infatuation of sense-pleasure. It is the contemplation of death that destroys vanity. It is the contemplation of death that gives balance and a healthy sense of pro- portion to our highly overwrought minds with their misguided sense of values. It is the contemplation of death that gives strength and steadi- ness and direction to the erratic human mind, now wandering in one direction, now in another, without an aim, without a purpose. It is not for nothing that the Buddha has, in the very highest terms, commended to His disciples the practice of mindfulness regarding death. This is known as maraõànussati bhàvanà . One who wants to practice it must, at stated times, and also every now and then, revert to the thought maraõaü bhavissati ‘death will take place’. This contemplation of death is one of the classical meditation subjects treated in the visuddhi magga (path of purifi - cation) which states that in order to obtain the fullest results, one should practice this meditation in the correct way, that is, with mindfulness ( sati ), with a sense of urgency ( saüvega ) and with understanding ( màna ). For example, suppose a young disciple fails to realize keenly that death can come upon him at any moment, and regards it as something that will occur in old age in the distant future, his contemplation of death will be lacking strength and clarity, so much so that it will run on lines which are not conducive to success. How great and useful is the contemplation of death can be seen from the following benefi cial effects enumerated in the visuddhi magga – “The disciple who devotes himself to this contemplation of death is always vigilant, takes no delights in any form of existence, gives up hankering after life, censures evil doings, is free from craving as regards the requisites of life; his perception of impermanence becomes established, he realizes the painful and soulless nature of existence and at the moment of death he is devoid of fear, and remains mindful and self- possessed. Finally, if in this present life he fails to attain to Nibbàna, upon the dissolution of the body, he is bound for a happy destiny.” Thus, it will be seen that mindfulness of death not only purifi es and refi nes the mind, but also has the effect of robbing death of its fears and terrors, and helps one at that solemn moment when he is gasping for his last breath, to face that situation with fortitude and calm. He is never unnerved at the thought of death, but is always prepared for it. It is such a man that can truly exclaim, “O’ death, where is thy sting?”"},{"pageNumber":990,"pageContent":"239.

Now this place was thickly overgrown with grass. As one of the monks put on his robe, the skirt of the robe dragged through the grass and became wet with drops of dew. Thought the bràhmin, “The grass should be cleared away from this place.” So on the following day he took his mattock, went thither, cleared the place, and made it as clean and smooth as a threshing-fl oor. The day after, he went to that place again. As the monks put on their robes, he observed that the skirt of the robe of one of the monks dropped to the ground and dragged in the dust. Thought the bràhmin, “Sand should be sprinkled here.” So he brought sand and sprinkled it on the ground. Now one day, before breakfast, the heat was intense. On this occasion he noticed that as the monks put on their robes, sweat poured from their bodies. Thought the bràhmin, “Here I ought to cause a pavilion to be erected.” Accordingly he caused a pavilion to be erected. Again, one day early in the morning, it rained.

At the conclusion of the meal he took the Buddha’s bowl to permit him to pronounce the words of thanksgiving. “Ven- erable,” said he, “as I stood in this place when the monks were putting on their robes and watched them, I saw this and that, and I did this and that.” And beginning at the beginning, he told the Buddha the whole story.

The story goes that a certain youth of respectable family, who lived at Sàvatthi, retired from the world, became a monk, and made his full profession, becoming known as Venerable Tissa. Subsequently, while he was in residence at a monastery in the country, he received a coarse cloth eight cubits in length. Having completed residence, he celebrated the Terminal Fes- tival, and taking his cloth with him, went home and placed it in the hands of his sister. Thought his sister, “This robe-cloth is not suited to my brother.” So with a sharp knife she cut it into strips, pounded them in a mortar, whipped and beat and cleaned the shoddy, and, spinning fi ne yarn, had it woven into a robe-cloth. The Venerable procured thread and needles, and assembling some young monks and novices who were skilled makers of robes, went to his sister and said, “Give me that cloth; I will have a robe made out of it.” She took down a robe-cloth nine cubits in length and placed it in the hands of her youngest brother. He took it, spread it out, and said, “My robe-cloth was a coarse one, eight cubits long, but this is a fi ne one, nine cubits long. this is not mine; it is yours. I don’t want it. Give me the same one I gave you.” “Venerable, this cloth is yours; take it.” He refused to do so. Then his sister told him everything she had done and gave him the cloth again, saying, “Venerable, this one is yours; take it.” Finally, he took it, went to the monastery and set the"},{"pageNumber":996,"pageContent":"996 robe-makers to work. His sister prepared rice-gruel, boiled rice, and other provisions for the robe-makers, and on the day when the cloak was fi nished, gave them an extra allowance. Tissa looked at the robe and took a liking to it. Said he, “Tomor- row I will wear this robe as an upper garment.” So he folded it and laid it on the bamboo rack. During the night, unable to digest the food he had eaten, he died, and was reborn as a louse in that very robe. When the monks had performed the funeral rites over his body, they said, “Since there was no one to attend him in his sickness, this robe belongs to the congregation of monks; let us divide it among us.” Thereupon that louse screamed, “These monks are plundering my property!” And thus screaming, he ran this way and that. The Buddha, even as he sat in the Perfumed Chamber, heard that sound by Supernatural Audition, and said to Venerable ânanda, “ânanda, tell them to lay aside Tis- sa’s robe for seven days.” The Venerable caused this to be done. At the end of seven days that louse died and was reborn in the Abode of the Tusita gods. On the eighth day the Buddha issued the following order, “Let the monks now divide Tissa’s robe and take their several portions.” The monks did so and, amongst themselves, discussed as to why the Buddha had caused Tissa’s robes to be put aside for seven days. When the Buddha was told of their discussion, he said, “Monks, Tissa was reborn as a louse in his own robe.

At Sàvatthi, we are told, a multitude of noble disciples gave alms before breakfast, and after breakfast, taking ghee, oil, honey, molasses, garments, and other requisites, went to the monastery and lis- tened to the Dhamma. When they departed, after listening to the Dhamma, they praised the virtues of Venerables Sàriputta and Moggallàna. The Venerable Udàyi overheard their talk and said to them, “It is because you have heard only these Ven- erables preach the Dhamma that you talk as you do; I wonder what you would say if you were to hear me preach the Dhamma.” Those who heard his remark thought to themselves, “This must be some preacher of the Dhamma; we ought with- out fail to hear this Venerable also preach the Dhamma.” So one day they made the following request of the Venerable, “Venerable, today is the day when we are wont to go and listen to the Dhamma. After we have presented alms to the congre- gation of monks, be good enough, Venerable, to preach the Dhamma to us by day.” The Venerable accepted the invitation. When it was time for them to listen to the Dhamma, they went to the Venerable and said, “Venerable, preach the Dhamma to us.” So Venerable Udàyi sat down in the seat, took a painted fan in his hand, waved it back and forth, but not knowing a single word of the Dhamma, said, “I will intone the Sacred Word; let some one else preach the Dhamma.” So saying, he descended from the seat. The disciples caused someone else to preach the Dhamma, and again assisted him"},{"pageNumber":1000,"pageContent":"1000 to mount the seat to intone the Sacred Word. But again the second time, the Venerable, who knew no more about inton- ing than he did about preaching, said, “I will recite the Sacred Word at night; let some one else intone the Sacred Word now.” The disciples therefore caused another to intone the Sacred Word and at night brought the Venerable in again. But at night also he knew as little how to intone, and said, “I will recite at dawn; let some one else recite at night.” So saying, he descended from the seat. The disciples caused another to recite the sacred word at night and at dawn brought the Ven- erable in again. But once more he failed. Thereupon the multitude took up clods of earth, sticks, and other missiles, and threatened him, saying, “Simpleton, while we were talking about the virtues of Venerables Sàriputta and Moggallàna, you said this and that. Why don’t you say something now?” The Venerable took to fl ight, and the multitude ran after him. As he ran, he fell into a certain cesspool. The multitude talked over the incidents of the day, saying, “As Kàludàyi listened to our praise of the virtues of Venerables Sàriputta and Moggallàna, he became jealous, declared himself to be a preacher of the Dhamma, and when people rendered him honour and said to him, ‘We would hear the Dhamma,’ he sat down in the Seat of the Dhamma four times, although he knew not a single word suitable to recite. Then, when we said to him, ‘Yet you presented yourself as an equal to our noble Venerables Sàriputta and Moggallàna,’ and took up clods of earth, sticks, and other missiles, and threat- ened him, he ran away and fell into a cesspool.” The Buddha drew near and asked them, “Monks, what are you talking about now, as you sit here all gathered together?” When they told him, he said, “Monks, this is not"},{"pageNumber":1001,"pageContent":"1001 the fi rst time he has wallowed in a cesspool; he did the same thing in a previous state of existence also.” After relating this Jàtaka in detail, the Buddha said, “At that time the lion was the Venerable Sàriputta and the boar was Kàludàyi.” Having fi n- ished the lesson, the Buddha said, “Monks, Udàyi had learned only the merest fragment of the Dhamma, but he never repeated the Texts.

The story goes that this youth married a young woman of equal birth. From the day of her marriage his wife played the adulteress. Embarrassed by her adulteries, the youth had not the courage to meet people face to face. After a few days had passed, it became his duty to wait upon the Buddha. So he approached the Buddha, saluted him, and sat down on one side. “Disciple, why is it that you no longer let yourself be seen?” asked the Buddha. The youth told the Buddha the whole story.

One Indian writer, Hemacandra, looked down upon women as the torch lighting the way to hell – narakamàrgadvàrasya dãpikà . The Buddha did not humiliate women, but only regarded them as feeble by nature. He saw the innate good of both men and women and assigned to them their due places in His teaching. Sex is no barrier for purifi cation or service. Sometimes the Pàli term used to connote women is màtugàma which means ‘mother-folk’ or ‘society of mothers’. As a mother, a woman holds an honourable place in Buddhism. The mother is regarded as a conven- ient ladder to ascend to heaven, and a wife is regarded as the best friend ( paramà sakhà ) of the husband. Although at fi rst the Buddha refused to admit women into the Sangha on reasonable grounds, yet later He yielded to the entreaties of Ven- erable ânanda and His foster-mother, Mahà Pajàpatã Gotami, and founded the order of bhikkhunãs (nuns). It was the Buddha who thus founded the fi rst society for women with rules and regulations. Just as arahats Sàriputta and Moggallàna were made the two chief disciples in the Sangha, the oldest democratically constituted celibate Sangha, even so the arahats Khemà and Uppalavannà were made the two chief female disciples in the Order of the Nuns. Many other female disciples, too, were named by the Buddha Himself as amongst most distinguished and pious followers. Amongst the Vajjis, too, freedom to women was regarded as one of the causes that led to their prosperity. Before the advent of the Buddha women did not enjoy suffi cient freedom and were deprived of an opportunity to exhibit their innate spiritual capabilities and their mental gifts. In ancient India, as is still seen today, the birth of a daughter to a family was considered an unwelcome and cumbersome addition. On one occasion while the Buddha was conversing with King Kosala, a messenger came and informed the king that a daughter was born unto him. Hearing it, the king was naturally displeased. But the Buddha comforted and stimulated him, saying, “A woman child, O Lord of men, may prove even better offspring than a male. To women who were placed under various disabilities before the appearance of the Buddha, the establishment of the Order of Nuns was cer- tainly a blessing. In this Order queens, princesses, daughters of noble fami- lies, widows, bereaved mothers, helpless women, courtesans, all despite"},{"pageNumber":1007,"pageContent":"1007 their caste or rank met on a common footing, enjoyed perfect consolation and peace, and breathed that free atmosphere which was denied to those cloistered in cottages and palatial mansions. Many, who otherwise would have fallen into oblivion, distinguished themselves in various ways and gained their emancipation by seeking refuge in the Sangha. Khemà, the fi rst chief female disciple, was the beautiful consort of King Bimbisàra. She was at fi rst reluctant to see the Buddha as she heard that the Buddha used to refer to external beauty in disparaging terms. One day she paid a casual visit to the monastery merely to enjoy the scenery of the palace. Gradually she was attracted to the hall where the Buddha was preaching. The Buddha, who read her thoughts, created by His psychic powers a handsome young lady, standing aside fanning Him. Khemà admired her beauty. The Buddha made this created image change from youth to middle age and old age, till it fi nally fell on the ground with broken teeth, grey hair, and wrinkled skin. Then only did she realize the vanity of external beauty and the fl eeting nature of life. She thought, “Has such a body come to be wrecked like that? Then so will my body also.” The Buddha read her mind and said: They who are slaves to lust drift down the stream, Like to a spider gliding down the web He of himself wrought. But the released, Who all their bonds have snapped in twain, With thoughts elsewhere intent, forsake the world, And all delight in sense put far away. Khemà attained arahatship and with the king’s consent entered the Order. She was ranked foremost in insight amongst the nuns. Patàcàrà, who lost her two children, husband, parents and brother under very tragic circum- stances, was attracted to the Buddha’s presence by His willpower. Hearing the Buddha’s soothing words, she attained the fi rst stage of sainthood and entered the Sangha. One day, as she was washing her feet she noticed how fi rst the water trickled a little way and subsided, the second time it fl owed a little further and subsided, and the third time it fl owed still further and subsided. “Even so do mortals die,” she pondered, “either in childhood, or in middle age, or when old.” The Buddha read her thoughts and, projecting His image before her, taught her the Dhamma. She attained arahatship and"},{"pageNumber":1008,"pageContent":"1008 later became a source of consolation to many a bereaved mother. Dhammadinnà and Bhaddà Kàpilàni were two nuns who were honoured exponents of the Dhamma.

To one who entertains doubt with the question ‘Am I a woman in these matters, or am I a man, or what then am I?’ – the Evil One is fi t to talk.” Amongst the laity, too, there were many women who were distin- guished for their piety, generosity, devotion, learning and loving-kindness. Visàkhà, the chief benefactress of the Order, stands foremost amongst them all. Suppiyà was a very devout lady who, being unable to procure some fl esh from the market, cut a piece of fl esh from her thigh to prepare a soup for a sick monk. Nakulamàtà was a faithful wife who, by reciting her virtues, res- cued her husband from the jaws of death. Sàmàwati was a pious and lov- able queen who, without any ill-will, radiated loving-kindness towards her rival even when she was burnt to death through her machination. Queen Mallikà, on many occasions, counselled her husband, King Pasenadi. A maidservant, Khujjuttarà, secured many converts by teaching the Dhamma. Punabbasumàtà was so intent on hearing the Dhamma that she hushed her crying child thus: O silence, little Uttarà!

The story goes that one day this monk administered medical treatment, in return for which he received a portion of choice food. As he went out with this food, he met a Venerable on the road and said to him, “Venerable, here is some food which I received for administering medical treatment. Nowhere else will you receive food like this. Take it and eat it. Hence- forth, whenever I receive such food as this in return for admin- istering medical treatment, I will bring it to you.” The Venerable listened to what he said, but departed without saying a word.

It has been left over for this section as it is more appro- priate to consider it under practice. The Teachings of the Buddha are for everyone. No one has ever been excluded from becoming a Buddhist by sex, race or colour. It depends upon the individual Buddhist (and his circumstances) whether he remains a layman or becomes a monk (or nun). The benefi t which each class derives from the other is mutual: the laymen give robes, food, shelter and medicines to the monks and these are a monk’s supports for his life. The monks (and nuns) on their part, give something most precious to the laity: the Dhamma as they have studied, practiced and realized it. Thus lay Buddhists can easily fi nd advice and help in a monastery from one of the teachers there or perhaps from a son, uncle or some other relative who is practicing either permanently or for some time as a novice, monk or nun. And so, a balance is preserved, each group giving to the other something necessary for right livelihood. Monks and novices have sets of rules to guide them in their life and these, being voluntarily observed as ways of self-training, may be equally voluntarily relinquished, as when a monk becomes a nov- ice again or reverts to the state of a layman. In some countries, it is a common practice for laymen to spend some time as a novice or monk, (the latter ordination is only given to persons over the age of twenty years). Usually this is done when a school or college education is over, before taking up work, and for a period of three or four months from approximately July to October or November. This period, when monks must reside in their monastery, is known as the Rains Residence and is meant to be a period devoted to learning, the practice of meditation or some other intensifi ed spiritual activity. After this yearly Rains Residence is over, monks are free to go to other monasteries or into the forest as they wish. In the Buddhist Sangha, monks should not possess money and are to live their lives with few possessions. As monks, they must, of course, refrain from any sort of sexual intercourse, thus observing ‘chastity’. But they have not the rule to"},{"pageNumber":1014,"pageContent":"1014 observe unquestioning ‘obedience’ though they have obligations as disciples of a teacher and all good monks honour these strictly. When, after at least fi ve years, they have some learning and experience, knowing their rules well, they are free to wander here and there as they choose, seeking good teachers, or practicing by themselves. Mention should be made of the four most important precepts in the monk’s code, for breaking which he is expelled from the Sangha, never being able in this life to become a monk again. These four rules are: 1) Never to have any sexual relations; 2) Never deliberately to kill a man, or to order other persons to kill, either other human beings or themselves; 3) Never to take anything that does not belong to one with the intention of possessing it oneself, 4) Never to claim falsely any spiritual attainment, powers, or degree of enlightenment (he is excused if he is mad, conceited or not serious). A monk’s actual possessions are very few and any other objects around him should be regarded by him as on loan from the Sangha. He has only eight Requisites: an outer double-thick ‘cloak’ an upper- robe, an under-robe, a bowl to collect food, a needle and thread to repair his robes, a waistband for his under-robe, a razor, and a water- strainer to exclude small creatures from his drinking water so that neither they nor himself, are harmed. As to his duties, they are simple but not easy to perform. He should endeavour to have wide learning and deep understanding of all that his Teacher, the Enlightened One, has taught: he should practice the Teaching, observing Virtue, strengthening Collectedness and developing Wisdom; he will then realize the Buddha’s Teachings according to his practice of them; and fi nally, depending upon his abilities, he may teach accordingly by his own example, by preaching, by writing books, etc. When going for Refuge to the Sangha, one should not think of Refuge-going to the whole body of monks for though some of them are Noble, the true nobility experienced after the fi re of Supreme Wis- dom has burnt up the defi lements, a good number are still worldlings"},{"pageNumber":1015,"pageContent":"1015 practicing Dhamma. Among the laity too, there may be those who are Noble. The Noble monks and laity together form the Noble Sangha which, as it is made up of those who are freeing and have freed them- selves from the bondage of all worlds, is truly a secure Refuge. That lay people may at tai n t h is supermu nda ne Nobilit y should be suffi cient to prove that this Teaching is meant also for them, though to do this they must practice thoroughly. The Jewel of the Sangha has known many great teachers from the immediate disciples of Lord Buddha, such as the Venerables A¤¤à-Koõda¤¤a, Sàriputta, Moggallàna, Mahàkassapa, ânanda; and Venerable Nuns such as Mahàpajàpati, Khemà, Uppalavannà, Dhammadinnà, with laymen such as the benevolent Anàthapiõóika and famous laywomen as was Visàkhà and this great procession of Enlightened disciples still continues down the ages to the present day. Although one may go for Refuge to the exterior Noble Sangha, one should seek for the real Refuge within. This is the collection of Noble Qualities (such as the Powers of Faith, Energy, Mindfulness, Collectedness and Wisdom) which will lead one, balanced and cor- rectly cultured, also to become a member of the Noble Sangha. After describing Buddhist beliefs and their basis in the Triple Gem or Threefold Refuge, it is now time to outline what Buddhists practice in order to realize the Teachings of the Enlightened One, and so substantiate within their own experience the doctrines which ini- tially they believed. As a frame for the vast mass of teachings which would qualify to be considered here, an ancient threefold summary of the Teaching is used: virtue, collectedness and wisdom. Lord Buddha has concisely formulated them in a verse famous in all Buddhist lands: Never doing any kind of evil, (refers to virtue) The perfecting of profi table skill, (to collectedness) Purifying of one’s heart as well, (to wisdom) This is the Teaching of the Buddhas."},{"pageNumber":1016,"pageContent":"1016 These are known as the three trainings, but since the last one, Wis- dom, is both mundane and supermundane, four sections have been devised as comprising the range (though far from the full substance) of the Dhamma: mundane wisdom, virtue, collectedness and super- mundane wisdom. Special Note : There is a strange idea current in some places that Buddhism is only for monks. Nothing could be further from the truth. As we hope to show here, there is something for everyone to do, whether monks or laity. It is true that many of the Buddha’s dis- courses are addressed to monks but this does not preclude the use of their contents by the laity. How much Buddhist Teaching one applies to one’s life, while to some extent depending on environment: work, family, etc., in the case of lay people, does to a greater extent depend on one’s keenness and determination. The monk is in surroundings more conducive to the application of the Buddha’s Teachings, as he should have less distractions than do the laity. Even among monks, ability and interest naturally vary. The word ‘priest’ should never be used for a bhikkhu , the best translation being ‘monk’. Buddhist monks and nuns do not beg for their food nor are they beggars. A strict code of conduct regulates a monk’s round to collect food. He may not for instance, make any noise – cry out or sing – in order to attract people’s attention. He walks silently and in the case of meditating monks, with a mind concentrated on his subject of medita- tion, and accepts whatever people like to give him. Lord Buddha once gravely accepted the offering of a poor child who had nothing else to give except a handful of dust: the child had faith in the Great Teacher. From this, one learns that it is not what is given that is important, but rather, how a thing is given. The monk is to be content with whatever he is given, regarding the food or a medicine to keep the mind-body continuum going on."},{"pageNumber":1017,"pageContent":"246.

The following is an analysis of these fi ve. Among the items of right behaviour, the lowest are the pa¤casãla , the fi ve precepts for training, the ABC of Buddhist ethics. These are the basic principles for the lay follower. They are: (1) I undertake the training precept to abstain from killing anything that breathes; (2) I undertake the training precept to abstain from taking what is not given. (3) I undertake the training precept to abstain from sexual misconduct. (4) I undertake the training precept to abstain from speaking falsehood. (5) I undertake the training precept to abstain from liquor that causes intoxication and heedlessness. Sir Edwin Arnold, in The Light of Asia , states the fi ve Precepts in these words: Kill not – for pity’s sake – lest ye slay The meanest thing upon its ward way. Give freely and receive, but take from none By greed, or force, or fraud, what is his own. Bear not false witness, slander not nor lie; Truth is the speech of inward purity. Shun drugs and drinks, which work the wit abuse; Clear minds, clean bodies, need no Soma juice. Touch not thy neighbour’s wife, neither commit Sins of the fl esh unlawful and unfi t. These sãlas are to be kept and acted on in one’s daily life, they are not for mere recitation, for lip-service or for applying to others. He who knoweth the Precepts by heart, but faileth to practice them, Is like unto one who lighteth a lamp and then shutteth his eyes. Buddhism does not demand of the lay follower all that a member of the Sangha is expected to observe. But whether monk or layman, moral habits are essential to the upward path. One who becomes a Buddhist by taking"},{"pageNumber":1022,"pageContent":"1022 the three refuges is expected, at least, to observe the fi ve basic precepts which is the very starting point on the path. They are not restricted to a particular day or place, but are to be practiced throughout life everywhere, always. There is also the possibility of their being violated by all save those who have attained at least the fi rst stage of sanctity ( sotàpatti ). Nevertheless when a transgression occurs it is useless to repent for one’s weaknesses and shortcomings, for repentance will not do any good to or help oneself or others. It will only disturb one’s mind. Again, it may be observed that, according to Buddhism, wrongdoing is not regarded as a ‘sin’, for that word is foreign to the teaching of the Buddha. There is no such thing as ‘breaking the Buddha’s laws’, for he was not a law-giver or an arbitrator who punished the bad and rewarded the good deeds of beings, hence there is no repentance, sorrow or regret for ‘sin’. The doer of the deed is responsible for his actions; he suffers or enjoys the consequences, and it is his concern either to do good, or to be a transgressor. It must also be stated that all actions, good or ill, do not necessarily mature. One’s good kamma may suppress the evil kamma and vice versa. As the formula clearly shows, there are no laws or commandments. Voluntarily you promise to observe the training precepts, and there is no compulsion or coercion; you yourself are responsible for your actions. If you violate what you have undertaken to keep, it is very necessary then to make a fi rm determination not to repeat, but to correct your weakness, and try hard not to lapse again. A careful thinker ought to realize that the sole purpose of keeping these precepts is to train oneself, to control one’s impulses, evil inclinations and wrong acts, and thus pave the path to puri- fi cation and happiness, give security to society and promote cordiality. On close analysis we know that the observance of these precepts is the only way to lessen our lust (greed), hate and delusion, the root causes of all evil in society. For instance, the fi rst precept cannot be transgressed without entertaining thoughts of hate and cruelty, in the case of the third it is spe- cifi cally lust, the second and the fourth maybe due to both greed and hate, and the fi fth to greed, while delusion is behind all the fi ve precepts. It is important to note that to take intoxicating liquor causes delu- sion. It prevents clear thinking, lessens one’s power of reasoning and brings about negligence, infatuation and a host of other evils.

Says the Buddha: Give up this base of all evil Which leads to madness, To abuse of mind. Now one may argue that to drink in moderation is harmless, but there is a saying: First a man takes a drink, Then the drink takes a drink, Then the drink takes the man. And so it is always better to bear in mind the Buddha’s warning: “Be mind- ful, self-controlled and serene.” Let us shun drugs and drinks which blind one to both the truths of life and the path to deliverance. Remember that the third and fi fth precepts have an affi nity, they support each other and both bring enjoyment ( rasassàda ). Sometimes in the Pàli canon the fi fth precept is omitted thus including it in the third as in the case of the moral code mentioned in the eightfold path. Then there are the ten precepts, or items for training which are meant for the novices ( sàmaneras ). They are formed by adding fi ve to those already mentioned. Sãla : moral purity. The fi ve bhikkhus referred to in these verses, were prac- ticing a discipline leading to sãla – moral purity. Meditation as a means of mental purifi cation presupposes the pos- session of moral purity ( sãla-visuddhi ) which forms its essential foundation. The intrinsic value of morality in Buddhist teaching lies in the fact that it purges the mind of its inferior tendencies and leaves it clear for the produc- tion of the inward illumination of true knowledge. The mind, which in its ordinary, lowly condition is wayward and accustomed to submit to the demands of every worldly impulse and passion of the lower instincts, is with diffi culty controlled when the higher incentive makes its appearance for the fi rst time as a mere stranger of no authority. Since meditation is the means of transmuting the ordinary consciousness to the higher state, it is necessary that some previous training and discipline should be imposed"},{"pageNumber":1024,"pageContent":"248.

To this end the mind must fi rst be well equipped with such higher moral qualities as faith, mindfulness, energy, and wisdom, and must establish them in such a position that they cannot be crushed by their adversaries. In all the schemes of Buddhist training therefore we fi nd that training in morality ( sãla ) is an essential preliminary to further progress. Therefore the disciple should fi rst have completely perfected this preliminary training in Sãla, for it is the beginning of the higher religious culture. In the words of the Saü- yutta Nikàya : What is the beginning of higher states? Sãla of perfect purity. Sãla is of paramount importance in meditation because it is the antidote of remorse and mental waverings which are inimical to the con- centration of the mind. To this effect it has been said: ânanda, the benefi t and advantage of moral virtues is the absence of remorse. Furthermore, we read in the âkankeyya Sutta : Monk, should a monk desire to attain the jhànas which are sublime, superhuman, the higher states of consciousness, conducive to a happy life, let him fulfi l the moral virtues... should he desire tranquility... psychic powers... higher knowledge... complete cessation of the àsavas – let him fulfi l the moral virtues. Sãla , being thus a fundamental feature of Buddhism, implies all good qualities which are included in the category of its moral and ethical teachings. Strictly speaking it comprises fi rst the consciousness built up by abstinence from immoral conduct, and secondly, the thought associ- ated with the observance of the positive rules enacted for moral purity. Its two salient characteristics are: (1) samàdhàna , the fi rm establishing of mind and thoughts together in harmony, and (2) upadhàrana , the supporting and holding together of all good qualities. The two aspects of sãla , negative and positive, are very distinctly marked in every department of religious and ethical life. The negative aspect emphasises abstinence from sins (which are vàritta , prohibitions), and the positive aspect the necessity of accumulating good and fulfi lling one’s duty ( càritta ). Every formula laid down in connec- tion with the precepts has these two aspects. For instance, (i) he refrains from killing, lays aside the cudgel and the sword; (ii) full of kindness and compassion he lives for the welfare and happiness of all living things."},{"pageNumber":1026,"pageContent":"249.

It is said of the novice Tissa that he used to go about fi nding fault with the gifts of the householder Anàthapiõóika, and of the female lay disciple Visàkhà, and even of the multi- tude of noble disciples; he even went so far as to fi nd fault with the Gifts beyond Compare. Whenever he received cold food in their refectory, he would complain because it was cold; whenever he received hot food, he would complain because it was hot. Whenever they gave but a little, he would blame them, saying, “Why do they give so very little?” And whenever they gave abundant alms, he would also blame them, saying, I suppose they had no place in their house to put it;” or, “Surely they should give the monks only so much as they require to support life; so much gruel and boiled rice as this is absolutely wasted.” But with reference to his own kinsfolk, he would say, “Oh, the house of our kinsfolk is a veritable tavern for all the monks who come from all the four quarters!” Thus did he sing the praises of his kinsfolk. Now Tissa was in reality the son of a certain gatekeeper. While accompanying some carpenters on a journey through the country, he retired from the world on his arrival at Sàvat- thi and became a monk. When the monks observed that he was thus fi nding fault with the gifts and other good works of men, they thought to themselves, “Let us fi nd out the truth about him.” So they asked him, “Brother, where do your kins-"},{"pageNumber":1028,"pageContent":"1028 folk live?” “In such and such a village,” replied Tissa. The monks accordingly sent a few novices there to investigate. The novices went there and asked the villagers, who provided them with seats and food in the rest-house, “There is a novice named Tissa who came from this village and retired from the world; who are his kinsfolk?” Thought the villagers, “There is no youth who has left any gentleman’s household in this vil- lage and retired from the world; what are these novices say- ing?” So they said to the novices, “Venerables, we have heard of a certain gatekeeper’s son who travelled with a company of carpenters and retired from the world; without doubt he is the novice you refer to.” When the young monks learned that Tissa had no kinsfolk of consequence there, they returned to Sàvatthi and informed the monks what they had learned, say- ing, “Venerable, Tissa goes around chattering without suffi - cient cause.” The monks reported the matter to the Buddha. Said the Buddha, “Monks, this is not the fi rst time he has gone about uttering words of disparagement and empty boasting; in a previous state of existence also he was a brag- gart.” The Buddha continued, “Monks, if any man is annoyed because others give either little or much, or coarse or fi ne food, or because they give nothing to him when he has given to others, such a man will not attain Trance or Insight or the Paths and the Fruits.” So saying, the Buddha preached the Dhamma by pronouncing these stanzas.

Wrong concentration is present in unwhole- some states of consciousness, and hence is only possible in the sensu- ous, not in a higher sphere. Samàdhi , used alone, always stands in the Suttas for sammà-samàdhi , or right concentration. The four fundamentals of mindfulness (7th step): these are the objects of concentration. The four great efforts (6th step): these are the requisites for concentration. The practicing, developing and cultivating of these things: this is the development ( bhàvanà ) of concentration. Right concentration ( sammà-samàdhi ) has two degrees of development: (1) neighbourhood concentration’ ( upacàra-samàdhi ), which approaches the fi rst absorption without, however, attaining it; (2) attainment concentration ( appanà- samàdhi ), which is the concentration present in the four absorptions ( jhàna ). These absorptions are mental states beyond the reach of the fi ve-fold sense-activity, attainable only in solitude and by unremitting perseverance in the practice of concentration. In these states all activ- ity of the fi ve senses is suspended. No visual or audible impressions arise at such a time, no bodily feeling is felt. But, although all outer sense-impressions have ceased, yet the mind remains active, perfectly alert, fully awake. The attainment of these absorptions, however, is not a requisite for the realization of the four supermundane paths of holiness; and neither neighbourhood-concentration nor attainment-concentration, as such, possess the power of conferring entry to the four supermun- dane paths; hence, they really have no power to free one permanently from evil things. The realization of the four supermundane paths is possible only at the moment of deep insight ( vipassanà ) into the imper- manency ( aniccatà ).

This insight, again, is attainable only during neighbourhood-concentration, not during attainment-concentration. He who has realized one or other of the four supermundane paths without ever having attained the absorptions, is called sukka- vipassaka , or suddha-vipassanàyànika , i.e., one who has taken merely insight ( vipassanà ) as his vehicle. He, however, who after cultivating the absorptions, has reached one of the supermundane paths, is called Samatha-yànika , or one who has taken tranquility ( samatha ) as his vehicle ( yàna ). Mental tranquility is brought about by bhàvanà -meditation. Samatha bhàvanà , the development of mental tranquility with concen- tration, is accompanied by three benefi ts; it gives happiness in the present life, a favourable rebirth, and the freedom from mental defi le- ments which is a prerequisite for attainment of insight. In samatha the mind becomes like a still, clear pool completely free from disturbance and agitation, and ready to mirror on its surface the nature of things as they really are, the aspect of them which is hidden from ordinary knowledge by the restlessness of craving. It is the peace and fulfi ll- ment which is depicted on the features of the Buddha, investing His images with a signifi cance that impresses even those who have no knowledge of what it means. Such an image of the Buddha can itself be a very suitable object of meditation, and is, in fact, the one that most Buddhists instinctively use. The very sight of the tranquil Buddha image can calm and pacify a mind distraught with worldly hopes and fears.

Now in the case of the Buddhas, no such thought ever enters their mind as the following, “This man is a Khattiya, this man is a Brahman, this is a rich man, this is a poor man; I will preach the Dhamma to this man in such wise as to exalt him; I will not do so, however, in the case of this other man.” It matters not with reference to what subject the Buddhas preach the Dhamma. They place reverence for the Dhamma before all else, and preach the Dhamma as though they were bringing down the Celestial River from the sky. But though the Buddha preached the Dhamma in this wise to the fi ve men who sat about him, one of them was asleep while sitting, the second one was drawing lines with his fi n- gers on the ground, the third was trying to shake a tree, the fourth was looking up at the sky.

The one who was scratching the earth with his hand was an earthworm, the one who was shaking the tree was a monkey, the one who was gazing up at the sky was an astronomer and the one who was listening attentively to the Dhamma was a learned astrologer. In this connection, ânanda, you must remember that one must be attentive to be able to understand the Dhamma and that there are many people who cannot follow what is being said.” Venerable ânanda then asked the Buddha, “Venerable Sir! What are the things that prevent people from being able to take in the Dhamma?” And the Buddha replied. “ânanda, they are unable to do so by reason of lust, by reason of hatred, by reason of delusion. For there is no fi re like the fi re of lust, consuming living beings as it does, without leaving so much as ashes behind. To be sure, the world-confl agration which closes an epoch burns up the world without leaving anything behind, but this is a fi re which breaks out only on the appear- ance of the seven suns, and this fi re burns only at times and at seasons. But as for the fi re of lust, there is no time when the fi re of lust does not burn.

Th is is a shortcomi ng of most men. It is almost a by- product of worldly life. In day to day life, much unhappiness is caused by this habit. This habit arises partly due to the inclination of some to be talkative. When they talk without inhibition fault-fi nding, too, happens. “Much talking is a source of danger, Through silence misfortune is avoided, The talkative parrot in a cage is shut, While birds that cannot talk fl y freely.” (Tibetan Yoga) How often do we speak deliberately? How often do we know what we are going to say before words have come tumbling out of our mouths? And sometimes we can even surprise ourselves by what we have said as much as we may have surprised and shocked the person to whom we were talk- ing. And quite often we wish we had not said something after we have said it. But then it is too late, for words that have once come out can never be withdrawn, even though we may apologize for them and retract them. For they have been expressed and there they abide forever. The sound vibra- tions made by our vocal cords have become something in the world, part of the world. Some people believe that the same is true of thought; that a thought once made, whether good or bad, never disappears out of exist- ence again. This is a very serious idea when we remember how lightly we utter words in anger, dislike, contempt or unkindness, and these words are conditioned refl exes. An event occurs that annoys us and before we are aware of it certain angry words have tumbled out. And the next stage, of course, after noticing what we are saying is to notice what we are think- ing, for we must think before we speak, although generally the thought is so rapid as to merge itself with the words. The injunction we often hear from grown ups to “Think before you speak!” (although they seldom do so themselves) means to slow up the rate of our replies so that we know our"},{"pageNumber":1044,"pageContent":"1044 thought before we express it aloud; then we know what we are saying. If you can form the habit of noticing what you are saying, and if you think about it, you will soon be able to see what sort of remarks come out the most rapidly and the most violently – the ones that hurt other people the most. When you reason something out you have to think and therefore speak slowly, but when your emotions are aroused, when you feel anger or dislike or pity or sorrow or resentment, then your emotions (whose centre is the middle of the brain) send their direction to the tongue and rapid, violent words pour forth before you can stop them. Thoughts controlled mean words controlled, and words controlled mean actions controlled, for angry words are often followed by blows, and control of words and actions means that you cannot be provoked into a fi ght and perhaps into drawing a knife and doing someone serious injury. Indeed, it is quite good fun try- ing to see the effect you produce on someone by refusing to allow yourself to be provoked. They tend to get more and more infuriated because they are trying to anger you and just cannot do it. Then you can watch and see how silly people look when they are losing their tempers, and you will know how silly you would look when you lose yours. So remember, the tongue is really your servant and you are its master, and it should therefore say what you want it to say, and not run off on its own as it does so often. For unfortunately, with most of us, it’s our tongue that is master of us and we are its slaves, and we have to listen to what it speaks in our name, and we seem unable to stop it wagging. “One does not become a wise man just by talking a lot, neither is he versed in the doctrine because he speaks much.” (The Buddha) Sometimes it is very diffi cult to fi nd out the truth through arguments. One who possesses oratorical power could twist and hide the facts for his own sake, and could easily run down another’s point of view. Especially, heated arguments never bring any good results. One who wants to know the real facts must think quietly and discuss with others calmly and gently. The truth will never come out through heated arguments, or by hurting the feelings of others; because everybody tries to defend his own prestige even though he knows he is in the wrong."},{"pageNumber":1045,"pageContent":"254. âkàse padaü natthi samaõo natthi bàhire papa¤càbhiratà pajà nippapa¤cà Tathàgatà.

The story goes that in times long past, when Subhadda’s younger brother gave alms, nine times, of the fi rst-fruits of a certain crop, Subhadda himself had no desire to give alms and refused, but in the end did give alms. As a result of this, he failed to see the Buddha both in the First Period of Enlight- enment and in the Second. In the Last Period of Enlighten- ment, however, when the Buddha had come to the time of the Great Decease, he thought to himself, “I have entertained doubts on three points and have asked the old monks to resolve my doubts for me. But because I have looked upon the monk Gotama as a novice, I have never asked him. Now, how- ever, the time of his Great Decease has come, and if I do not ask him now, I may be sorry hereafter.” Accordingly, he approached the Buddha. Venerable ânanda sought to prevent him. But the Buddha gave him leave to approach, saying to the Venerable, “ânanda, do not keep Subhadda away; let him ask me his question.” Therefore, Subhadda entered within the curtain, seated himself at the foot of the bed, and asked the Buddha the following questions, “Sir monk, is there such a thing as a"},{"pageNumber":1047,"pageContent":"1047 path through the air?

Thereupon Subhadda, the wandering ascetic, went to Upavat- tana Sàla grove of the Mallàs where the Venerable ânanda was, and approaching him spoke as follows: “I have heard grown-up and elderly teachers and their teachers, the wandering ascetics, say that seldom, and very seldom, indeed, do exalted, fully enlightened arahats arise in this world.

The Buddha heard the conversation between the Venerable ânanda and Subhadda, and addressing ânanda, said: “Nay, ânanda, do not prevent Subhadda. Let Subhadda, O ânanda, behold the Accom- plished One. Whatsoever Subhadda will ask of me, all that will be with the desire for knowledge, and not to annoy me. And whatever I shall say in answer he will readily understand.” Thereupon the Venerable ânanda introduced Subhadda to the Buddha. Subhadda exchanged friendly greetings with the Buddha and sitting aside said, “There are these ascetics and priests, O Gotama, who are leaders of companies and congregations, who are heads of sects and are well-known, renowned religious teachers, esteemed as good men by the multitude, as, for instance, Påraõa Kassapa, Makkhalã Gosàla, Ajita Kesakambali, Pakudha Kaccàyana, Sa¤jaya Bellaññhiputta, Niganñha Nàthaputta – have they all, as they themselves claim, thoroughly under- stood the Truth or not, or have some of them understood, and some not?” “Let it be, O Subhadda! Trouble not yourself as to whether all or some have realized it or not. I shall teach the doctrine to you. Listen and bear it well in mind. I shall speak.” “So be it, Lord!” replied Subhadda. The Buddha spoke as follows: “In whatever Dispensation there exists not the Noble Eightfold Path, neither is the First Samana, nor the Second, nor the Third, nor the Fourth to be found therein. In whatever Dispensation, O Subhadda, there exists the Noble Eightfold Path, there also are to be found the First Samaõa, the Second Samaõa, the Third Samaõa, the Fourth Samaõa.

And I, Lord, seek refuge in the Buddha, the Doctrine, and the Sangha. May I receive the Lesser and the Higher Ordination in the presence of the Buddha!” “Whoever, Subhadda,” said the Buddha, “being already commit- ted to the other doctrines desires the Lesser and the Higher Ordination, remains on probation for four months. At the end of four months, the disciples approving, he is ordained and raised to the status of a monk. Nevertheless, on understanding, I make the individual exception.” Then said Subhadda, “If, Lord, those already committed to other doctrines, who desire the Lesser and the Higher Ordination in this Dis- pensation, remain on probation for four months, I too will remain on probation; and after the lapse of that period, the disciples approving, let me be received into the Sangha and raised to the status of a monk.” Thereupon the Buddha addressed ânanda and said, “Then, ânanda, you may ordain Subhadda.” “So be it, Lord!” replied ânanda.

And in no long time after his Higher Ordination, the Venerable Subhadda, living alone, remote from men, strenuous, energetic, and resolute, realized, in this life itself, by his own intuitive knowledge, the consummation of that incomparable Life of Holiness, and lived abiding in that state for the sake of which sons of noble families rightly leave the householder’s life for the homeless life.

On a certain day the monks made their alms-round in a settlement at the north gate of Sàvatthi, and returning from their pilgrimage to the monastery, passed through the center of the city. At that moment, a cloud came up, and the rain began to fall. Entering a hall of justice opposite, they saw lords of justice taking bribes and depriving lawful owners of their property.

The summary below includes only the canon in Pàli, the language spoken by the Buddha, the works of which are complete. Sanskrit canons are either fragmentary, existing only in Chinese and Tibetan translations and untranslated into English, or else are composed of much later works which, although they are often ascribed to Gotama the Buddha, can hardly be his words. The Pàli canon was codifi ed in the fi rst council after the Buddha’s passing ( parinibbàna ). A few items have been added at later dates. This canon was then transmitted by memorizers – monks who learned portions of the discourses by heart from their Teachers, and in turn transmitted the memorized text to their monk-pupils. This verbal transmission lasted for about four hundred years. Many bràhmins trained in the art of commit- ting texts to memory became monks and faithfully transmitted the canon in Pàli language until the time of the fourth council in Sri Lanka. Due to the disturbed conditions of those times, the senior monks decided to commit the whole canon to writing. They assembled for this purpose and wrote the Buddha’s word using the metal stylus to inscribe ola palm leaves. Since that time the canon has been copied using the same materials until printed editions began to appear at the end of the nineteenth century. The fi rst complete printed edition was published by order of King Ràma the Fifth (Chulalongkorn) using the Thai script. In the West, the Pàli Text Society was founded by T. W.

These are the three qualities extolled in this verse. The assiduous cultivation of these virtues will make a man a wise person, but not talkativeness. To discipline the mind in these qualities and to become a true wise man ( pandito ), one must practice mind training ( bhàvanà ). The most effec- tive system in this regard is the meditation on mettà . The word maitrã , or mettà , means loving-kindness. Accordingly, the form of meditation which helps one to acquire the ability to con- sider all beings in this world, including animals, as one’s friends is mettà bhàvanà . May all beings be happy, may all beings be healthy, may all beings be well – extension of such thoughts towards all beings whether they be relatives or non-relative, friends or enemies, humans or animals is mettà bhàvanà . Wishing happiness towards humans alone does not mean maitrã in the true sense of the word. True maitrã con- stitutes the wishing of happiness to the entire world including even the smallest of living things. The Buddha is the supreme example of maitrã in this world. He has shown maitrã equally to all beings of the world, irrespective of their being friends or enemies, humans or non- humans. Maitrã is a merit of highest order. It is one of the four sublime states ( brahma vihàra ). It is one of the perfections ( pàramità ) for the attainment of supreme enlightenment ( sammà sambodhi ). According to the discourse of khanda sutta no harm could be caused by serpents or wild animals if loving-kindness is extended towards them. The benefi ts of mettà bhàvanà are dealt with in the discourse of the mettànisamsa . Therein are given eleven benefi ts of practicing mettà bhàvanà . (1) Comfortable sleep. (2) Waking up comfortably. (3) Not having bad dreams. (4) Being loved by all humans."},{"pageNumber":1063,"pageContent":"1063 (5) Being loved by deities. (6) Protection by deities.

(11) The birth in the brahma world after death for one who has developed concentration and who was not able to attain arahatship in this life. It is very signifi cant that out of these eleven benefi ts ten could be obtained in this very life. This meditation is of immense use in order to lead a happy life. The greatest wealth a man could possess is men- tal peace. The absence of mental peace is mainly due to the presence of enmity in the mind. If this meditation is continued without inter- ruption one can achieve the four transcendental states. As human beings, we are by nature envious of others’ happiness and progress. Therefore, to attain real loving kindness is rather diffi cult. Human beings are inclined to be happy about the good fortune of their wives and children. This is not real mettà but desire posing as mettà . This is a doctrine opposed to mettà and this tendency should be discouraged. The real mettà is to wish others happiness without ever expect- ing even the smallest benefi t in return. One should not confuse Mettà with the desire to develop the interests of one’s own family. In addition, without actually having a feeling of good-will towards all living beings it is meaningless to wish others health, wealth and happiness. Mettà bhàvanà bestows benefi ts on the person who cultivates mettà as well as on the persons towards whom such feeling are directed. Both parties are benefi tted only by genuine mettà . Mettà should be cultivated thus: Màtà yathà niyaü puttaü âyusà ekaputtamanurakkhe Evampi sabbabhåtesu Mànasambhàvaye aparimànaü"},{"pageNumber":1064,"pageContent":"259.

He was known as Ekådàna, because he knew only one stanza of exultation ( udàna ) by heart: To the monk of lofty thoughts, heedful, training himself in the ways of silence, To such a monk, tranquil and ever mindful, sorrows come not. But the monk fully understood the meaning of the Dhamma as conveyed by the stanza. On each sabbath day, he would exhort others to listen to the Dhamma, and he himself would recite the one stanza he knew. Every time he had fi nished his recitation, the guardian spirits ( devàs ) of the forests praised him and applauded him resoundingly. On one fast-day, two learned elder monks, who were well-versed in the Tipitaka, accompanied by fi ve hundred monks came to his place. Ekådàna asked the two elder monks to preach the Dhamma. They enquired if there were many who wished to listen to the Dhamma in this out of the way place. Ekådàna answered in the affi rmative and also told them that even the guardian spirits of the forests usually came, and that they usually praised and applauded at the end of discourses. So, the two learned elders took turns to preach the Dhamma, but when their discourses ended, there was no applause from the"},{"pageNumber":1066,"pageContent":"1066 guardian spirits of the forests. The two learned theras were puzzled; they even doubted the words of Ekådàna. But Ekådàna insisted that the guardian spirits used to come and always applauded at the end of each discourse. The two elders then pressed Ekådàna to do the preaching himself. Ekådàna held the fan in front of him and recited the usual stanza. At the end of the recitation, the guardian spirits applauded as usual. The monks who had accompanied the two learned elders complained that the devas inhabiting the forests were very partial. They reported the matter to the Buddha on arrival at the Jetavana Monastery. To them the Buddha said, “Monks! I do not say that a monk who has learnt much and talks much of the Dhamma is “one who is versed in the Dhamma, (Dham- madhara).” One who has learnt very little and knows only one stanza of the Dhamma, but fully comprehends the Four Noble Truths, and is ever mindful is the one who is truly versed in the Dhamma.” Explanatory Translation (Verse 259) yàvatà bahu bhàsati , tàvatà dhammadharo na yo ca appaü api sutvàna kàyena dhammaü passati , so ve dhammadharo hoti so dhammaü nappamajjati . yàvatà : just because; bahu bhàsati : one speaks a lot; tàvatà : by that; dhammadharo na : one does not become an upholder of the dhamma; yo ca : if someone; appaü api : even a little of the dhamma; sutvàna : having heard; kàyena : by his body; dhammaü passati : practices the dhamma; so : he; ve : with- out any doubt; dhammadharo hoti : becomes an upholder of"},{"pageNumber":1067,"pageContent":"1067 dhamma; yo : if someone; dhammaü : in dhamma; nappamaj- jati : is diligent (he too is an upholder of dhamma) One does not become an upholder of the Law of Righteous- ness merely because one talks quite a lot.

The tendency to speak effusively can be counteracted by the silence of the mind. The means to achieve this is meditation.

Herein the disciple knows the greedy mind as greedy, and the mind which is not greedy as not greedy; knows the angry mind as angry, and the not angry mind as not angry; knows the deluded mind as deluded, and the undeluded mind as undeluded. He knows the cramped mind as cramped, and the scattered mind as scattered; knows the developed mind as developed, and the undeveloped mind as undeveloped; knows the surpassable mind as surpassable, and the unsurpassable mind as unsurpassable; knows the concentrated mind as concen- trated, and the unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated; knows the freed mind as freed, and the unfreed mind as unfreed. Thus he dwells i n contemplat ion of the mi nd, either with regard to his own person, or to other persons, or to both. He beholds how the mind arises; beholds how it passes away; beholds the arising and pass- ing away of the mind. ‘Mind is there’: this clear awareness is present in him, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness; and he lives independent, unattached to anything in the world.

Here, kàya refers to the fi ve Aggregates of matter, feeling, perception, mental states, and consciousness. The view that there exists an unchanging entity, a permanent soul, when there is a complex compound of psycho-physical aggregates, is termed sakkàya - diññhi .

Now, he is called a once-returner because he is born in the human realm only once should he not attain arahatship in that birth itself. It is interesting to note that the ariya saint, who has attained the second stage of sainthood, can only weaken these two power- ful fetters with which he is bound from a beginningless past. At times, though to a slight extent, he may harbour thoughts of lust and anger. It is by attaining the third stage of sainthood, that of the anàgàmi (never-returner), that he completely eradicates those two fet- ters. Thereafter, he neither returns to this world nor is he born in the celestial realms, since he has rooted out the desire for sensual grati- fi cation. After death, he is reborn in the pure abodes ( suddhàvàsa ), an environment reserved for anàgàmis . There, he attains arahatship and lives till the end of his life.

Throughout his life, Buddha taught and guided people in spiritual matters – and even in worldly matters at times. He did not only preach, but also lived according to what he preached. The Buddha was the embodiment of the virtues that he preached. During his successful and eventful ministry of forty-fi ve years, he translated all his words into action. At no time did he ever express any human frailty or any base passion. Yet the Buddha’s moral code is the most perfect which the world has ever known. For more than twenty-fi ve centuries, millions of people have found inspiration and solace in his Teaching. His Teaching still beck- ons the weary pilgrim to the security and peace of Nibbàna. To Buddha, religion was not a bargain but a way to enlighten- ment. He did not want followers with blind faith; he wanted followers who could think freely and wisely. There was never an occasion when the Buddha expressed any unfriendliness towards a single person. Not even to his opponents and worst enemies did the Buddha express any unfriendliness. There were a few prejudiced minds who turned against the Buddha and tried to kill him; yet the Buddha never treated them as enemies. The Buddha once said, “As an elephant in the battle fi eld endures the arrows that are shot into him, so will I endure the abuse and unfriendly expres- sion of other people.” In the annals of history, no man is recorded as having so con- secrated himself to the welfare of all living beings as did the Buddha.

After attaining Nibbàna, the Buddha left a deathless message that is still living with us in the world today. Today we are confronted by the tenable threat to world peace. At no time in the history of the world was His message more needed than it is now. The Buddha was born to dispel the darkness of ignorance and to show the world how to get rid of suffering and disease, decay and death and the worries and miseries of living beings. No amount of talk and discussion not directed towards right understanding will lead to deliverance. This was the principle that guided the Buddha’s Ministry. The Buddha was not concerned with some meta-physical problems which only confuse man and upset his mental equilib- rium. Their solution surely will not free mankind from misery and ill. That was why the Buddha hesitated to answer such questions, and at times refrained from explaining those which were often wrongly formulated. The Buddha was a practical Teacher. His sole aim was to explain in all its detail the problem of dukkha , suffering, the universal fact of life, to make people feel its full force, and to convince them of it.

Similar offers were made by the chief of the suburbs of Ràjagaha, and by King Bimbisàra himself But Anàthapiõóika did not accept any such offers. At the end of the alms-giving, Anàthapiõóika invited the Buddha to Sàvatthi with the fraternity of monks for residence. “Well Gone Ones take delight in lonely spots,” said the Buddha. “I know that, Venerable,” asserted Anàthapiõóika. The Buddha deliv- ered an admonition to Anàthapiõóika, and left the place. After fi nish- ing his work at Ràjagaha Anàthapiõóika left for Sàvatthi. He was a person with many friends and associates, and he used to give good counsel to others. On the way, he told the people, “Friends, lay out parks, build monasteries and offer alms.

Among the four groups of the disciples of the Buddha, bhikkhu (monks), bhikkhunã (nuns), upàsaka (male lay disciples), and upàsikà (female lay disciples) – the Sangha or Order of monks are most closely associated with the Buddha. The duty of the Buddhist monk is to learn the Teachings of the Buddha and to give guidance and advice in accordance with these Teachings. He is also required to perform the religious duties and ceremonies. His duty is not limited to preserving the Buddha’s Word; his duty is also to introduce the Teachings of the Buddha throughout the world. It is not easy to introduce the Buddha’s Teaching in any part of the world without obtaining the proper guid- ance and assistance from monks. Buddhist monks are not regarded as priests since they do not act as mediator between deity and man. They can only show the way for those who want to fi nd their own salvation. To approach the Buddha,"},{"pageNumber":1087,"pageContent":"1087 no mediator is required. There is no need for the special intervention of a priest or any selected person. From the very beginning of the establishment of the Sangha, two different groups of monks were formed: grantha dhura and vidar- shanà dhura . Grantha dhura are the monks who associate with the pub- lic. They offer their religious services to society. Educated young men who become monks usually join this group. Vidarshana dhura are the monks who keep away from the busy society and devote their time to meditation. Most elderly men who become monks usually join this group. The monks who associate with the public should not neglect their meditation. They should try to devote at least a few minutes a day for meditation. Those who devote their time only to medita- tion should give others necessary instruction how to meditate. Both groups of monks are equally important. In certain Buddhist countries, some monks set aside certain periods of time for meditation; then they return to serve the society. Buddhist monks live a very simple life. Their attitude towards life is fi lled with tolerance and contentment. In the monasteries where monks live, there is an atmosphere of peace, tranquillity and serenity. There is a look of peace and calm on the smiling faces of many of the monks. Their faces often refl ect a dignity, a gentleness, an air of detach- ment and freedom from the commitments of the householder. Kind- ness, truthfulness, and devotion towards religion are their duties. In many Buddhist countries, monks render service not only in the religious fi eld but also in social, educational, cultural and health activities. In fact, monasteries in Buddhist countries are traditionally centres of social service. If the Buddha had not introduced the Sangha, the Teaching of the Buddha would have disappeared long ago from this world. The tradition of Buddhist councils, which have ensured the perpetuation of the Word of the Buddha, was initiated by monks. Several Councils were held to draw up the canonical texts and the creed of Buddhism in their pure form.

But he that weighs well all the aggregates of being and acts accordingly, he is a monk indeed.” Explanatory Translation (Verse 266) yàvatà pare bhikkhate tena bhikkhu na hoti ; vissaü dhammaü samàdàya tàvatà bhikhu na hoti yàvatà : because (someone); pare : from others; bhikkhate : begs; tena : by that; bhikkhu na hoti : (he) does not become a monk; vissaü dhammaü : repulsive belief; samàdàya : embracing; tàvatà : to that extent; bhikkhu na hoti : does not become a monk No one becomes a monk merely because he begs from others."},{"pageNumber":1090,"pageContent":"1090 An individual, though begging, does not become a monk if he embraces vicious and repulsive beliefs.

Commentary The Buddha ’ s encounters with bràhmins : In the course of his earthly mission the Buddha encountered mostly aggressive bràhmins, who confronted him. One of these is the nameless bràhmin who occa- sioned the present verses. Although he was not signifi cant enough to have his name known, some other bràhmins He had to deal with were remarkably well-known. Some of them were: Soõadanóa : The Buddha, accompanied by a group of many monks, arrived in the city of Campà, in the Kingdom of Anga, and was staying on the bank of the pond Gaggarà. At that time, the bràh- min Soõadanóa was living in Campà, enjoying the area donated to him by King Bimbisàra.

Soõadanóa told his attendant to inform the people that he himself wished to join them and see the Buddha. About fi ve hundred bràhmins who had come to Campà heard of the wish of Soõadanóa to see the Buddha, and went and told him that it was beneath his dignity to go and see the Buddha, and that the proper thing was for the Buddha to come and see Soõadanóa. When these bràhmins reminded Soõadanóa of his birth, qualities and attainments, he spared no pains in describing to them the high birth, the supreme virtues, and the attainments of the Buddha in detail. Finally, Soõadanóa succeeded in convincing them of the greatness of the Buddha, and went in their company to see the Buddha. Soõadanóa entered into conversation with the Buddha, and was able to listen to a long exposition of the doctrine. Being fully satisfi ed with the teaching of the Buddha, he took refuge in the Triple Gem, and offered himself as a life-long devotee of the Buddha. After inviting the Buddha and the monks to meals, he offered them alms the next day at his residence. Kåñadanta . When the Buddha was travelling in Magadha in the company of about fi ve hundred monks. He came to the bràhmin vil- lage of Khànumàtà and was staying at its mango grove. At this time, the bràhmin Kåñadanta was living in this village donated to him by King Bimbisàra. He also had made preparations for an animal sacri- fi ce on a large scale, and cattle, calves, goats and lambs, numbering seven hundred in each group, were tethered for sacrifi ce. The people of the village were going in large numbers to the mango grove to see the Buddha, and were seen by Kåñadanta. When he heard of the purpose of their visit, he also intimated to them his wish to join them. However, the hundreds of bràhmins who had come to take part in the sacrifi ce tried to dissuade him from going to see the Buddha, and referred to his status and attainments in lofty terms.

Pokkharasàti . When the Buddha was travelling in the kingdom of Kosala, in the company of about fi ve hundred monks, He came to the bràhmin village of Icchànaïgala, and began to spend the time in Icchànaïgala Grove. At this time, the bràhmin Pokkharasàti was liv- ing in the city of Ukkaññhà, and was enjoying its proceeds. This city had been donated to him by Pasenadi, the King of Kosala. Pokkharasàti had a learned pupil called Ambaññha under him, and he asked his pupil to go and see the Buddha at the grove and ascertain whether the Buddha had the greatness attributed to Him by the people. The pupil asked the teacher how he could ascertain whether the Buddha had the greatness attributed to Him. He advised his pupil to look for the thirty-two marks of a great person in the Buddha, for such a person, according to their teaching, is destined to be a Universal Monarch if he remains a layman, and a fully enlight- ened Sanctifi ed One if he renounces the world. Ambaññha took leave of his teacher, and went by chariot, in the company of a large number of young men, to the grove in which the Buddha dwelt. When he knocked at the door of the chamber of the Buddha, as he was told by the monks who were outside, the Buddha opened the door. Ambaññha entered the chamber with his followers, and his followers sat down. He kept standing and walking while talk- ing to the Buddha. The Buddha asked him whether that was the way he used to talk to his teachers and elders. He said that it was different with them, but with shaven-headed dark monks, he was used to talk in that man- ner. The Buddha remarked that he was ill-educated and undisciplined. Ambaññha then found fault with the Sàkyans, and referred to them in"},{"pageNumber":1094,"pageContent":"1094 disparaging terms. The Buddha pointed out to him that he descended from a servant girl of the Sàkyans, and he admitted the fact. After listening to a long discourse of the Buddha and satisfy- ing himself that He had the thirty-two great marks, Ambaññha took leave of the Buddha, and went to his teacher Pokkharasàti, He told Pokkharasàti that the Buddha was endowed with the thirty-two marks of a great man and that he had a long conversation with Him. When Pokkharasàti heard how his pupil had spoken to the Buddha, he lost his temper, and kicked him in anger. Pokkharasàti forthwith went to the Buddha, apologized to Him for the shortcomings of his pupil, and listened to the doctrine of the Buddha. He realized the doctrine and took refuge in the Triple Gem, and offered himself as a life-long devotee of the Buddha. Jànussoni . Jànussoni was a learned bràhmin who lived in the bràhmin village of Manasàkata in the kingdom of Kosala. When the Buddha was residing at the Jetavana Monastery in Sàvatthi, Jànussoni was travelling at noon through the city of Sàvatthi in a chariot drawn by all-white mares. On the way he met the wandering ascetic Pilotika, and asked him where he was coming from. He said that he was com- ing from meeting the Venerable Gotama. “What do you think of the Venerable Gotama? Is He highly learned? Is He very erudite?” asked Jànussoni. “Who am I to fathom the wisdom and estimate the erudition of the Venerable Gotama? It is only another person like the monk Gotama who is capable of measur- ing and estimating his wisdom and erudition.” “You are speaking very highly of the monk Gotama,” remarked Jànussoni. “Who am I to speak highly of the monk Gotama? He is praised by the praiseworthy. He is the greatest among all deities and men,” said Pilotika. Jànussoni asked, “How did you come to be so pleased with the monk Gotama?” Pilotika explained the greatness of the Buddha, making use of the simile of the feet of the elephant. After listening to Pilotika, Jànussoni hastened to see the Buddha, and met Him. He also told the Buddha everything that Pilotika said about the Buddha, using the simile of the feet of the elephant. The Buddha"},{"pageNumber":1095,"pageContent":"1095 completed the discourse of the simile, and preached the Cålahatthi- padopama Sutta in full. At the end of the discourse, Jànussoni praised the Buddha and became a life-long disciple of the Buddha. On another occasion, the Buddha preached to him the Bhayab- herava Sutta, where He explained the theory of cause and effect, and said that His doctrine is a middle way teaching which avoids both materialism and nihilism. Sela and Keniya . When the Buddha was travelling with one thousand two hundred and fi fty monks in the region of Anguttaràpa, He came to the suburb of âpana. The matted-haired ascetic Keniya who had heard much about the greatness of the Buddha went to see the Him. After he listened to the admonition of the Buddha, he was highly pleased with Him, and invited Him to alms with the fraternity of monks. The Buddha, however, did not accept the invitation, as the fraternity of monks was large and Keniya was a follower of the bràhmins. When Keniya pleaded for the third time and made his request, the Buddha accepted his invitation in silence. Keniya went to his hermitage and with the help of his friends and relations made all preparations for the great feast in honour of the Buddha. The building of the pavilion was undertaken by Keniya himself. When these preparations were in progress a highly educated bràhmin called Sela, who was a teacher of three hundred pupils and a follower of Keniya, came to this spot and inquired what all those preparations were for, and heard that they were for the Buddha who was dwelling in their suburb, âpana. When Sela saw the personality of the Buddha endowed with the thirty-two marks of a great being, he was highly satisfi ed, and praised the personality of the Buddha in a number of verses. After the Buddha replied to him, he begged for ordination, and with his following entered the order and received higher ordination. In due course, they became sanctifi ed ones. The next day, Keniya entertained the Buddha and the fraternity of monks with a great feast at his hermitage, at the end of which the Buddha gave over the merits to him in two verses."},{"pageNumber":1096,"pageContent":"268.

The story goes that whenever the heretics took a meal in a given place, they would say to their hosts, “May tranquillity be your portion, may happiness be your portion, may your years increase. In such and such a place there is mud, in such and such a place there are thorns; to such a place you should not go.” After this manner would they express their thanks and good wishes, and only after having so done, would they depart. But in the fi rst period of enlightenment, before the saying of thanksgivings had been enjoined, the monks would depart from the refectory with never a word of thanksgiving to their hosts. At this the people were offended and said, “We hear words of thanksgiving and good wishes from the here- tics, but the reverend monks depart in utter silence.” The monks reported this matter to the Buddha. Said the Buddha, “Monks, henceforth in refectories and other such places render thanks according to your good pleas- ure and speak pleasantly to your hosts as you sit beside them.” Thus did the Buddha enjoin upon them the saying of thanks- givings, and they did according to his command. When the people heard the words of thanksgiving, they put forth the greater efforts, invited the monks to take meals in their houses, and went about bestowing abundant offerings upon them.

Commentary Heretics : On many occasions, the hermits spread adverse rumours about the Buddha and His Teachings. These stanzas, too, were occasioned by such an attempt by the heretics to mar the reputation of the Buddha. Some attempts by heretics to sully the character of the Buddha took a gruesome guise. Here are some such attempts. When, at one time, the Buddha was dwelling at the Jãtavana Mon- astery, the heretics were greatly worried about their own future. For the Buddha and the fraternity of monks were highly respected, honoured, looked after and obeyed by the people, and they were provided with meals, robes, seats, medicines and other requisites. On the other hand, the heretics were not so respected, honoured, looked after and listened to, and they did not receive meals, robes, seats, medicines and other requisites. As the heretics were unable to face this situation, they went to a female wandering ascetic, who was known as Sundarã (beauty) due to her bodily beauty. She was young in age, and bad in character. It was the plan of the heretics that they would attack the character and reputation of the Buddha and the monks through this female ascetic. They asked her, “Sister, can you do some favour for your relations?” “What do you want me to do? There is nothing I will not do for you. I am prepared even to sacrifi ce my life for the sake of my relations,” assured the female ascetic.

Accordingly, she decked herself well and began to go to the Jetavana at the time when people were returning from the Mon- astery after listening to the discourses of the Buddha.

She would actually spend the night in a hermitage of the heretics, and early in the morning would come to the city passing the Jetavana Monastery. When people asked her where she was coming from, she said that she was returning home after spending the night in the Fragrant Chamber of the Buddha. The heretics, one day, got this female ascetic killed and buried in a hole in the ditch of the Jãtavana Monastery by some hirelings, and went and complained to King Pasenadi that Sundarã was missing. “Where do you suspect her to be?” asked the King. “In the Jetavana Monastery,” they replied promptly. The king gave them permission to search where they wished. Find- ing the body near the Jetavana Monastery, they carried it to the palace. Then they said to the king, “O’ King, the followers of the Buddha have killed this Paribbàjikà and have thrown away her body in the rubbish heap near the Jetavana Monastery to cover up the misdeed of their Teacher.” To them, the king replied, “In that case, you may go around the town and proclaim the fact.” So they went around the town carrying the dead body of Sundarã, shouting, “Look at what the followers of the Buddha have done; see how they have tried to cover up the misdeed of Gotama!” The procession then returned to the palace. The king next ordered his men to further investigate the murder of Sundarã. On investigation, they found out that Sundarã had died at the hands of some drunkards. So they were brought to the king. When ques- tioned, the drunkards disclosed that they were hired by the ascetics to kill Sundarã and put her body near the Jetavana Monastery. The king then sent for the non-Buddhist ascetics, and they fi nally confessed their role in the murder of Sundarã. The king then ordered them to go round the town and confess their guilt to the people. So they went round the town saying, ‘We are the ones who killed Sundarã. We have falsely accused the disciples of Gotama just to bring dis- grace on Gotama. The disciples of Gotama are innocent, only we are guilty of the crime.” As a result of this episode, respect for the Buddha was very much enhanced, to his glory."},{"pageNumber":1102,"pageContent":"270.

This was Asoka’s digvijaya or war of military con- quest. It was only after the completion of this digvijaya of Asoka that, stricken by remorse at the terrible magnitude of the human slaughter involved, he embarked on a policy of Dharmavijaya or conquest by righteousness, imbued with the high ideals of love and compas- sion taught by the Buddha’s Dhamma. Thereafter he was known as Dharmàsoka. Having turned to the path of righteousness, after embracing Buddhism, Asoka set about spreading the faith both in his empire and in far-fl ung lands abroad.

The story goes that some of these monks considered thus within themselves. “We have acquired virtue; we have taken upon ourselves the pure practices; we are exceedingly learned; we dwell in places of abode that are solitary and remote; we have developed the supernatural powers by ecstatic meditation. For us it would be no hard matter to attain arahatship; indeed, we could attain arahatship any day we wished.” Likewise those of the monks who had attained the fruit of the third path, considered thus within themselves, “For us it would be no hard matter now to attain arahatship.” One day all of them approached the Buddha, saluted him, and seated themselves respectfully to one side. The Buddha asked them, “But, monks, have you brought your religious duties to consummation?” The monks replied, “Venerable, we have attained such and such degrees of sanc- tity.

Commentary nekkhammasukhaü : the joy of renunciation. To attain higher reaches of the joy of spiritual life, nekkhamma (renunciation) is essential. On one occasion, the Buddha was residing at the Deer Park in Isipatana, near Vàrànasi. Thereupon the Buddha addressed the group of fi ve monks as follows: There are these two extremes ( antà ), O’ monks, which should be avoided by one who has renounced ( pabbajitena ): (1) Indulgence in sensual pleasures – this is base, vulgar, worldly, ignoble and profi tless and, (2) Addiction to self-mortifi cation – this is painful, ignoble and profi tless. Abandoning both these extremes the Buddha has comprehended the middle path ( majjhimà pañipadà ) which promotes sight ( cakkhu ) and knowledge ( ¤àna ), and which tends to peace ( våpasamàya ), higher wis- dom ( abhi¤¤àya ), enlightenment ( sambodhàya ), and Nibbàna. What, O’ monks, is that middle path the Buddha has compre- hended which promotes sight and knowledge, and which tends to peace, higher wisdom, enlightenment, and Nibbàna? The very noble eight-fold path – namely, right understanding ( sammàdiññhi ), right thoughts ( sammà saükappa ), right speech ( sammà vàcà ), right action ( sammà - kammanta ), right livelihood ( sammà àjãva ), right effort ( sammà vàyàma ), right mindfulness ( sammàsati ), and right concentration ( sammà samàdhi ), – This, O’ monks, is the Middle path which the Tathàgata has comprehended."},{"pageNumber":1109,"pageContent":"272. ...phusàmi nekkhammasukhaü aputhujjanasevitaü bhikkhu vissàsamàpàdi appatto àsavakkhayaü.

When this doctrine was being expounded there arose in the Venerable Koõda¤¤a the dustless, stainless, truth-seeing eye ( Dhammacakkhu ) and he saw that “whatever is subject to origination all that is subject to cessation.” When the Buddha expounded the discourse of the Dhamma- cakka, the earth-bound deities exclaimed, “This excellent Dhamma- cakka which could not be expounded by any ascetic, priest, deity, Màra or bràhma in this world has been expounded by the Buddha at the Deer Park in Isipatana, near Vàrànasi."},{"pageNumber":1113,"pageContent":"Chapter 20 Magga Vagga The Pat h"},{"pageNumber":1114,"pageContent":"273.

The story goes that once upon a time the Buddha, after journeying through the country, returned to Sàvatthi and seated himself in the hall of Dhamma. When he had taken his seat, these fi ve hundred monks began to talk about the paths over which they had travelled, saying, “The path to such and such a village is smooth; to such and such a village, rough; to such and such a village, covered with pebbles; to such and such a village, without a pebble. After this manner did they discuss the paths over which they had travelled. The Buddha, perceiving that they were ripe for arahatship, went to the hall of Dhamma, and seating himself in the seat already prepared for him asked, “Monks, what is the present subject of discus- sion as you sit here together?” When they told him, he said, “Monks, this is a path foreign to our interests; one who is a monk should address himself to the noble path, for only by so doing can he obtain release from all sufferings.” Explanatory Translation (Verse 273) maggànaü aññhangiko seññho saccànaü caturo padà dhammànaü viràgo seññho dipadànaü ca cakkhumà maggànaü : of the paths; aññhangiko maggo : the eight-fold"},{"pageNumber":1116,"pageContent":"1116 (path is); seññho : is greatest; saccànaü : of truths; caturo padà : four noble truths (are the greatest); dhammànaü : of the states of being; viràgo : detachment-Nibbàna; dipadànaü : of the two-footed; cakkhumà : one who possesses eyes (the Buddha) is the greatest Of all paths, the eight-fold path is the greatest.

(1) Sãlavisuddhi – purity of morals – The person with an impure character has always a fear that others will fi nd fault with him or bring shame on him or take revenge on him. Similarly, his own conscience troubles him, saying that he has done something wrong. The mind of the non-virtuous person is debilitated by such thoughts. The person whose mind is thus debilitated will not gain any results if he turns to meditation. Like a tree which is planted on infertile soil, his mind will not be able to attain wisdom by concentration. Therefore, a yogàvacara , if he wishes to concentrate and reach an exalted state or attain the correct path by meditation, must fi rst of all prepare the way for meditation, just as a farmer prepares the land for cultivation. If he is a layman he must act according to the ways of a layman. If he is a monk he must act according to the ways of a monk. The layman if he wishes to be virtuous must at the minimum observe the fi ve precepts. Virtue will arise when all defi lements are eradicated. Therefore, he must try his best to purify himself by leading a virtuous life instead of feeling that he is unable to lead a virtuous life and giving up meditation.

The knowledge of nàma råpa which we gather from books is insuffi cient for us to eradicate our defi lements and attain the path leading to salvation and enlightenment. Knowledge from books is knowledge at second-hand which has not been experienced, as it has not been realized by the individual himself. It is not self-realization. To attain the correct path we require more than a knowledge from books; we require a clear philosophy which we can comprehend for ourselves. This philosophy can be realized only by meditation and meditation alone. Just as a person sharpens his knife before he begins to cut anything hard, in order to understand the nature of nàma råpa the yogàvacara must fi rst of all prepare his mind. When his mind is free from hindrances, he attains citta visuddhi . To purify our minds we must increase our powers of concentration. The nature of the mind is not to concentrate for a long time on one object but to wander from object to object. The person who is travelling at a very fast speed is unable to comprehend any one thing he sees on the side of the road as his mind, which has not attained concentration and wanders from object to object, cannot comprehend the true nature of things. When, by insight meditation, we are concentrating on the real nature of mind and matter, if the mind does not abide for a long time on this, it will begin to wander from object to object very fast. Such a mind will not be able to grasp the ultimate reality. If he is unable to do so, the wisdom of insight meditation would not arise in him quickly. Therefore, if he wishes to develop insight wisdom quickly, he must concentrate and prepare his mind for such a venture. After diligent practice a person will attain the ability to keep his mind concentrated on one object for a long time. This ability of mind concentration is attained by mental discipline ( samàdhi ). Without allowing in the intervening period anything else to enter his mind, if he is able to keep his mind concentrated on one object for a long time he is in a state of trance.

Therefore, there is no harm if those who do not like to develop concentration can develop pure insight wisdom. Of those who develop insight wisdom after concentration there are some who attain this insight wisdom while they are in a trance. Still others develop concentration up to a certain point and when they have reached the fi rst stage of concentration they are able to attain to insight wisdom. Others develop concentration and insight wisdom at the same time and meditate making use of both these factors at the same time. Of these systems, to achieve insight wisdom after attaining a state of trance does not suit the present day. If one does so it may happen that for a long time one may not be able to achieve insight wisdom. It is our opinion that at fi rst a person must develop his concentration and thereafter adopt the method of developing both concentration and insight wisdom. This seems to be the best system which can be followed. (3) Diññhivisuddhi – Purity of views – To purify one’s mind by meditating on the Buddha or by undertaking any other system of meditation one must commence with diññhi visuddhi bhàvanà . What is âtma diññhi dråsti ? âtma diññhi dråsti means not considering mind and matter as mind and matter, myself as myself, mother as mother, father as father, brother as brother, sister as sister, an enemy as an enemy, a friend as a friend, and considering other varied individuals as beings in the same character and treating them and accepting them as such. This is âtma dråsti . Sakkàyadiññhi is another name for it. ( sakkàya - diññhi , means belief in a soul or self). Insight wisdom means considering the nature of mind and matter as mind and matter itself and not as oneself or as father, mother or any other being. This insight wisdom which is free from àtma dråsti is called diññhi visuddhi . The brief explanation of diññhi visuddhi is purity of wisdom."},{"pageNumber":1123,"pageContent":"276.

The yogàvacara will have to spend a very long time to acquire this diññhivisuddhi – pure wisdom. He must master correctly the diññhivisuddhi . If the yogàvacara tries to go forward without correctly mastering the diññhivisuddhi his meditation practice will be confused. This should be mastered in the manner in which the doctrine of mind and matter can be seen as myself, mother or father or any other individual just as we peel the bark of a banana tree and thus make our wisdom into separate sections. This meditation has to be developed till we get rid of the ideas which we formerly entertained in our minds as mine, my father, my brother, my son, my wife – i.e., the conception of considering them as beings and individuals and until we can see and analyse them as I am not I, and my father is not my father, and consider them as just constituents of matter and mind. According to Buddhist philosophy there is no permanent, unchanging spirit or entity which we can consider as self or soul or ego in contra- distinction to matter, and consciousness or vi¤¤àna should not be considered as spirit as opposed to matter. It should be particularly emphasised, because a wrong conception that consciousness is a sort of self which continues as a permanent substance throughout life has persisted throughout the ages. The Buddha has explained it further by an example. The nature of a fi re is described by the material on account of which it burns. If it burns on account of straw it is called a straw fi re. So consciousness is described according to the condition through which it arises. The Buddha has described in unequivocal terms that conscious- ness is dependent on matter, sensation, perception and mental concep- tions and that it cannot subsist independently of them. Consciousness exists with matter as its means ( råpàyaü ), matter as its object ( råpàram- maõa ), matter as its support – ( råpapatiññhitaü ) and seeking happiness it may grow, increase and develop. Consciousness may exist having sensation as its means or mental conception as its support, and seek-"},{"pageNumber":1125,"pageContent":"1125 ing happiness it may grow, increase and develop. If a man says “I shall show the coming, the going, the disap- pearance, the arising, the growth, the increase or the development, or consciousness apart from matter, sensation, perception and mental conception,” he would be speaking of something that does not exist. In brief, the fi ve aggregates ( Pa¤cakkhandha ) can be described thus. What we can describe as a being or an individual or I, is only a con- venient name or a label given to the combination of these fi ve groups. They are all impermanent and subject to constant change. Whatever is impermanent is sorrow, The true meaning of the Buddha’s words is, briefl y, this: The fi ve aggregates of attachment are equal to sorrow. For two consecutive moments they are not the same. Therefore, A is not equal to A. They are a fl ux or stream of momentary arising or dis- appearing. “O’ Brahmaõa, it is just like a mountain river fl owing far and swift taking everything along with it. There is no moment, no instant or second when it ceases to fl ow, but it continues to fl ow. Similarly, is human life like a mountain river.” In these words the Buddha explained to Raññhapàla that the world is in continuous fl ux and is impermanent. As one thing disappears it conditions the appearance of the next in a series of cause and effect. There is no unchanging substance within them. There is nothing behind them that can be described as a permanent self, or soul. It will be agreed by every one that neither matter nor sensation nor perception, nor any of these mental activities nor consciousness can be really called “I”. But these independent fi ve physical and mental aggregates are working together in combination as a physio-psychological machine to give the idea of “I”. But this is an erroneous idea, a mental conception which is nothing but one of those fi fty-two mental conceptions of the fourth aggregate, which is the idea of self. These fi ve aggregates taken together are popularly called suf- fering itself. There is no other being or myself standing behind these fi ve aggregates who experiences dukkha ."},{"pageNumber":1126,"pageContent":"1126 Kammassa Kàrakà natthi – vipàkassaca vedako Suddhadhammà pavattanti – evetaü sammadassanaü (4) Kaõkhàvitàraõa visuddhi – purity of the conquest of doubts – To obtain the supramundane state, doubt is a great hindrance.

In the Buddhist system, there are three char- acteristics of existence – anicca , dukkha and anatta . Impermanence implies that all forms of existences end up in decay and death. With the exception of Nibbàna, this applies to all phenomena. Whoever constantly keeps in mind the fact that he would someday be subjected to death and that death is inevitable, would be eager to fulfi l his duties to his fellow men before death, and this would certainly make him heedful in respect of this world and the next. It has been said, therefore, that a “monk who is engaged in the thought of death is ever heedful ( Maraõasati-manuyutto bhikkhu satatam appamatto hoti ). There are, however, extremists who say that refl ection on death is an unnecessary thought that tends to retard the progress of a per- son. This is not so. For, thus has Visnusarman said in the Pancatantra : Samcintya tamugradandam mrtyum manusyasya vicaksanasya Varsambusikta iva carmabandhah Sarvaprayatnah Sithili bhavanti. (All the endeavours of a wise man who constantly thinks of death that causes severe punishment, are bound to become easy and fl exible like leather bags moistened with rain water.)"},{"pageNumber":1133,"pageContent":"1133 It must be noted, however, that Buddhism never advocated dejection and neglect of one’s duties by pondering over death. On the contrary, what is taught in Buddhism is the fulfi llment of one’s duties and obligations in the best possible manner even on the eve of death. The Buddha had expressed His categorical disapproval of the post- ponement of one’s duties: thus says the Buddha: Ajjeva kiccam àtappaü Ko ja¤¤a Màraõaü suve... (Today itself, one should strive for the accomplishment of one’s tasks; for, who knows whether death would strike tomorrow... ) The Uraga Jàtaka recounts how a father, when his only son lay dead, bitten by a serpent, sent news of the incident to the inmates of the house and without awaiting their arrival, continued to plough his fi eld; he was a person who regularly practiced meditation on death. By thus refl ecting on the inevitability of death, one becomes increasingly active in the performance of one’s duties; one also develops a sense of fearlessness towards death. Furthermore, such a person takes care not to commit the slightest sin that is likely to cause suffering in the next world; he also becomes a free person who has forsaken all bonds and attachments to his beloved ones and other objects. Both monks and laymen, unmindful of death and consider- ing themselves as immortals, are often heedless in cultivating vir- tues. They engage themselves in strife and arguments and are often dejected, with their hopes and aspirations shattered. At times, they postpone their work with the hope of doing it on a grand scale in the future, and end up without being able to do anything. There- fore, it is only proper that one should daily refl ect on death. Out of the four-fold topics of meditation prescribed for Buddhists as suitable to be practiced everywhere ( sabbattha kammaññhàna ), refl ec- tion on death comes as the fourth ( Buddhànussati mettà ca – asubhaü Maraõassati ). “ Ekadhammo bhikkave bhàvito bahulãkato ekanta nibbidàya viràgàya nirodhàya upasamàya abhi¤¤àya sambodhàya nibbàõàya saüvattati ; katamo"},{"pageNumber":1134,"pageContent":"1134 ekadhammo maraõassati .” There is, O’ monks, one Dhamma which when meditated on and practiced constantly, leads to detachment from the world of becoming, freedom from all defi lements, emancipa- tion from worldly sorrows, acquisition of higher knowledge, realiza- tion of the four noble truths, and attainment of Nibbàna. What is this one Dhamma? It is the constant refl ection on death. The loftiness and signifi cance of refl ection on death is clearly conveyed by this doctri- nal passage. dukkha : suffering. This is the second of the three characteristics of existence. The four noble truths, too, pivot around suffering ( dukkha ). The Buddha’s Teaching regarding the four noble truths deals with the knowledge of suffering, the cause of suffering, the cessation, and the way to the cessation of suffering. The truth regarding suf- fering tells us that all beings are subject to birth, decay, disease and death. In brief, the fi ve aggregates ( skandhàs ): physical phenomena ( råpa ); feelings of sensation ( vedanà ); perception ( sa¤¤à ); volitional activities ( samkhàra ); consciousness ( vi¤¤àna ); all constitute suffering. This is the truth regarding suffering, and the right understanding of it is sammàdiññhi . This Sammàdiññhi is basically essential for the under- standing of the real nature of the world. Of the four noble truths, the understanding of suffering is of cardinal importance. Thus this is considered fi rst.

What a being enjoys as hap- piness is really suffering, which springs from this craving or attachment. Man pursues many pleasures, seeking happiness like the deer deluded by a mirage because of this craving or attachment. To be emancipated from Saüsàra or the cycle of birth and rebirth one must understand the truth regarding craving. This craving assumes three forms: (1) Kàma taõhà (attachment to sensual pleasures); (2) Bhava taõhà (attachment to existence); (3) Vibhava taõhà (attachment to non-existence)."},{"pageNumber":1135,"pageContent":"1135 Kàma taõhà arises out of sakkàyadiññhi or the idea that there exists an unchanging entity or a permanent soul – that there is such an entity as ‘I’. A person who is under such a delusion always strives to pander to his fi ve senses. It is because of kàma taõhà that happiness is regarded as enjoyment through the fi ve senses. This is a delusion. As kàma taõhà increases, suffering arises. Thus kàma taõhà is a cause of suffering. Bhava taõhà is the craving that arises in a being for termination of life. This craving arises in a being who believes in the existence of a soul ( sassatadiññhi ). Vibhava taõhà is the craving that arises in a being for the enjoy- ment of sensual pleasures as an end in itself. This craving arises because of the non-belief in an after-life ( ucchedadiññhi ). The Lokàyata theory of Càrvàka and Ajita Kesakambala belongs to this category. In the Brahmajàla Sutta of the Buddhist canon seven types of ucchedavàda are expounded. The person who develops right understanding, the fi rst con- stituent of the noble eight-fold path, realizes that this craving is the cause of suffering. The second of the four noble truths deals with the cause of this craving or suffering. Right understanding gives the knowledge of how to end suffering. The Third noble Truth deals with the cessation of suffering. This cessation of suffering is brought about by eradicating the three kinds of craving ( taõhakkhaya ) which give rise to suffering. This is Nibbàna. Right understanding gives us the knowledge of the path to the cessation of suffering. The fourth noble truth deals with the cessation of suffering ( dukkhanirodhagàmini patipadàgnàna ). The path to the cessa- tion of suffering is the noble eight-fold path. This is the middle path. It is, therefore, impossible to eradicate the three forms of craving which give rise to suffering without following the middle path. Anatta : no-soul concept. This is the third of the three charac- teristics of existence as the Buddha expounded. The idea of a lack of a soul, or a permanent and abiding self, or an àtman that is eternal is extremely diffi cult for most individuals to understand. The sum total of the doctrine of change taught in Buddhism is that all component things that have conditioned existence are a proc-"},{"pageNumber":1136,"pageContent":"1136 ess and not a group of abiding entities, but the changes occur in such rapid succession that people regard mind and body as static entities. They do not see their arising and their breaking up, but regard them unitarily, see them as a lump ( ghàna sa¤¤à ) or whole. Those ascetics and bràhmins who conceive a self in diverse ways conceive it as either the fi ve aggregates of clinging, or as any one of them. “Herein the untaught worldling... considers body as the Self, Self as possessed of body as included in the self, self as included in the body... similarly as to feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness... Thus this is the wrong view. The I am notion is not abandoned... It is very hard, indeed, for people who are accustomed continu- ally to think of their own mind and body and the external world with mental projections as wholes, as inseparable units, to get rid of the false appearance of ‘wholeness’. So long as man fails to see things as processes, as movements, he will never understand the anatta (no-Soul) doctrine of the Buddha. That is why people impertinently and impatiently put the question: “If there is no persisting entity, no unchanging principle, like self or soul ( àtman ), what is it that experi- ences the results of deeds here and hereafter?” Another view of the three characteristics of existence are the characteristics of impermanence ( anicca ), suffering ( dukkha ) and not- self ( anatta ). These three characteristics are always present in or are connected with existence, and they refl ect the real nature of existence. They help us to deal with existence. What we learn to develop as a result of understanding the three characteristics is renunciation. Once we understand that existence is universally characterised by imper- manence, suffering and not-self, we eliminate our attachment to existence. Once we eliminate our attachment to existence, we gain the threshold of Nibbàna. This is the purpose served by the understand- ing of the three characteristics. It removes attachment by removing delusions, the misunderstanding that existence is permanent, is pleas- ant and has something to do with the self. This is why understanding the three characteristics is central to wisdom."},{"pageNumber":1137,"pageContent":"280.

Monk Tissa who stayed behind did not try hard and therefore achieved nothing.

So he resolved to practice meditation throughout the night. As he was walking in meditation on that night, he slipped and broke a thigh bone. Other monks hearing his cry went to help him.

He who believes in kamma, does not condemn even the most corrupt, for they have their chance to reform themselves at any moment.

A Buddhist who is fully convinced of the law of kamma does not pray to another to be saved but confi dently relies on himself for his emancipation. Instead of making any self-surrender, or propitiating any supernatural agency, he would rely on his own will-power and work incessantly for the weal and happiness of all. The belief in kamma, “validates his effort and kindles his enthusiasm” because it teaches individual responsibility. To an ordinary Buddhist kamma serves as a deterrent, while to an intellectual it serves as an incentive to do good. This law of kamma explains the problem of suffering, the mystery of the so-called fate and predestination of some religions, and above all the inequality of mankind. We are the architects of our own fate. We are our own creators. We are our own destroyers. We build our own heavens. We build our own hells. What we think, speak and do, become our own.

The Buddha knew his weakness and wanted him to mend his ways and to put him on the right path. So, whenever Poñhila came to pay obeisance, the Buddha would address him as ‘Useless Poñhila’. When Poñhila heard these remarks, he pon- dered over those words of the Buddha and came to realize that the Buddha had made those unkind remarks because he, Poñhila, had not made any serious effort to practice medita- tion and had not achieved any of the maggàs or even any level of mental absorption ( jhàna ). Thus, without telling anyone Venerable Poñhila left for a monastery at a place twenty yojanas (leagues) away from the Jetavana monastery. At that monastery there were thirty monks. First, he went to the most senior monk and humbly requested him to be his mentor; but the elder, wishing to humble him, asked him to go to the next senior monk, who in his turn sent him on to the next.

Medita- tion ( bhàvanà ) is a process of refi ning wholesome faculties, mental mostly. Mental Development (lit. calling into existence, producing) is what in English generally but rather vaguely, is called medita- tion. One has to distinguish two kinds – development of tranquillity ( samatha-bhàvanà ), i.e., concentration ( samàdhi ), and development of insight ( vipassanà-bhàvanà ), i.e., wisdom ( pa¤¤à ). These two important terms, tranquility and insight ( samatha- vipassanà ), are very often met with and explained in the Sutta, as well as in the Abhidhamma. Tranquility ( samatha ) is the concentrated, unshaken, peaceful and, therefore, undefi led state of mind, whilst insight ( vipassanà ) is the intuitive insight into the impermanency, misery and impersonal- ity ( anicca , dukkha , anatta ) of all bodily and mental phenomena of exist- ence, included in the fi ve groups of existence, namely corporeality, feeling, perception, mental formations and consciousness. Tranquility, or concentration of mind, according to Sankhepa- vanõanà (comment to Abhidhammattha-Sangaha ), bestows a three-fold blessing: favourable rebirth, a present happy life, and purity of mind which is the condition of Insight. Concentration ( samàdhi ) is the indispensable foundation and precondition of Insight by purifying the mind from the fi ve mental defi lements or hindrances ( nãvaraõa ) whilst insight ( vipassanà ) produces the four supermundane stages of holiness and deliverance of mind. The Buddha, therefore, says: “May you develop mental concentration, O’ monks; for whoso is mentally concentrated sees things according to reality”.

Intimate friends, one of another, they banded themselves together for the performance of good works. Hearing the Buddha preach the Dhamma, they said to themselves, “We are old men; why should we remain laymen any longer?” Accordingly, they asked the Buddha to admit them to the Sangha, and retiring from the world, adopted the monastic life. Now, by reason of their advanced years, they were unable to learn the Dhamma by heart, and, therefore, built a hermit- age of leaves and grass on the outskirts of the monastery, and lived there together. On their alms-round they generally went to the houses of their sons and wives and there took their meals. Now one of the old monks had a former wife named Madhurapàcikà, and she was a good friend to them all. There- fore, they all used to take the food they received to her house, and sit down there and eat it, and Madhurapàcikà would give them of her store of sauces and curries.

In came the Buddha and asked, “Monks, what are you discussing now, as you sit here all gathered together?” When they told him, he said, “Monks, this is not the fi rst time they have so conducted themselves; the same thing happened in a previous state of existence also. In a previous state of exist- ence they were all reborn as crows. As she was walking along the shore of the sea, a wave of the sea picked her up and fl ung her into the sea, and there she perished, whereupon they all wept and lamented. ‘We will pull her out again,’ said they, and forthwith set to work with their beaks to bale out the great ocean; fi nally were wearied of their task.” After the Buddha had related this Kàka Jàtaka in detail, he addressed the monks as follows, “Monks, in as much as you have incurred this suffering because of the forest of lust, hatred, and delusion, it behooves you to cut down this forest; by so doing you will obtain release from suffering.” Explanatory Translation (Verse 283) bhikkhavo vanaü chindatha mà rukkhaü vanato bhayaü jàyati vana¤ca vanatha¤ca chetvà nibbanà hotha"},{"pageNumber":1151,"pageContent":"1151 bhikkhavo : O’ monks; vanaü : the forest (of blemishes); chindatha : cut down; mà rukkhaü : (do) not (cut down) the tree; vanato : from the forest (of defilements); bhayaü : fear; jàyati : arises; vana¤ca : the forest; vanatha¤ca : and the undergrowth too; chetvà : having cut down; nibbanà hotha : achieve Deathlessness (forestlessness) O’ Monks, cut down the forests of defi lements.

The opening Discourses of Anguttara Nikàya states: Monks, I know not of any other single form by which a man’s heart is attracted as it is by that of a woman. Monks, a woman’s form fi lls a man’s mind. Monks, I know not of any other single sound... I know not of any other single smell... I know not of any other single fl avour... I know not of any other single touch... by which a man’s heart is attracted as it is by that of a woman. A woman’s sound, smell, fl avour, and touch fi ll a man’s mind. Monks, I know not of any other single form, sound, smell, fl a- vour and touch by which a woman’s heart is attracted as it is by the form, sound, smell, fl avour and touch of a man. Monks, a woman’s mind is fi lled with these things.” Here is a sermon on sex explained in unmistakable language, the truth of which no sane man dare deny. Sex is described by the Buddha as the strongest impulse in man. If one becomes a slave to this impulse even the most powerful man turns into a weakling; even the sage may fall from the higher to a lower level. The sexual urge, especially in youth, is a fi re that needs careful handling. If one is not thoughtful and restrained, it can cause untold harm. There is no fi re like lust. Passions do not die out: they burn out. Since the Buddha was a practical philosopher he did not expect his lay followers to lead ascetic lives. Indeed, he called them enjoyers of sense pleasures ( gihã kàmabhogã ). Being well aware of man’s instincts and impulses, his appetites and urges, the Master did not prohibit sexual relations for the laity as he had done for monks. But he warned"},{"pageNumber":1154,"pageContent":"1154 man against wrong ways of gratifying the sexual appetite. He went a step further and recommended the observation of the eight precepts with special emphasis on the third one for the laity during fast-days of retreat ( uposatha ) or as the occasion demanded. If a person makes up his mind to live an unmarried life he should make a real effort to be chaste in body, speech and thought. If he is not strong enough to remain single, he may marry, but he should refrain from such sexual relations as are wrong and harmful. As the Buddha explains in the Discourse on downfall: If a person is addicted to women (given to a life of debauchery), is a drunkard, a gambler, and squanders all his earnings – this is a cause of his downfall. Not satisfi ed with one’s own wives, if one has been with whores and the wives of others – this is a cause of one’s downfall. Being past one’s youth, to take as wife a girl in her teens, and to be unable to sleep for jealousy – this is a cause of one’s downfall. The Buddha has analysed the evil results of adultery in these words: Four misfortunes befall a man who is unmindful of right conduct and commits sexual misconduct with another man’s wife: acquisition of demerit, disturbed sleep, reproach, and suffering in niraya . Thus, there is the acquisition of demerit, and there is rebirth in the evil apàya realms. The enjoyment of a scared man with a scared woman is short- lived, and the king also metes out severe punishment.

The merchant in this story was not mindful of the fact of death. There are in this world people in various walks of life who resent the very word death, let alone refl ect on it. Infatuated by long life, good health, youth and prosperity, they completely forget the fact that they are subject to death. Immersed in the evanescent pleasures of the fi ve-fold senses, they seek only after material progress in this world, completely dis- regarding a future life, and indulging in vice through the mind, body and speech, They regard this impermanent and evanescent life as permanent and everlasting. It is to arouse a sense of dissatisfaction in such blind and ignorant people, to allay the pangs of sorrow caused by the separation of animate objects, like parents and children, and inanimate objects, like wealth and property, to inculcate the doctrine of impermanence in all beings, and thereby convince them of the unsatisfactoriness of life, and direct them towards the attainment of everlasting peace, that the Buddha preached these words. A person who has not comprehended the doctrine of the Buddha is infatuated by long life and considers himself as immortal, even though he may see many deaths around him; he is infatuated by good health and considers himself free from disease even though he may see countless diseased persons around him; he is infatuated by youth even though he may see many aged persons and considers himself as one who is not subject to old age; he is infatuated by wealth and prosperity even though he may see countless persons rendered destitute through loss of wealth; and he never thinks for a moment, that he too, might be subjected to such a state."},{"pageNumber":1163,"pageContent":"287.

Commentary Kisàgotami was foremost among the female Mahà arahats of the noble Sangha, for the ability to wear rough robes. We fi rst come across her during the dispensation of Padumuttara Buddha. She saw her like and immediately resolved to follow her in her footsteps. She gave alms, and practiced meditation. She was born in deva realms. She was born in this dispensation in a rich family. She duly married. But peo- ple took no notice of her. She was lean and hence she was called Kisà. Hence, her own name Gotamã was linked with Kisà and was known as Kisàgotami. When a son was born to her she became popular. As soon as the child came to an endurable age he died. The prop on which she was leaning was suddenly removed. Attachment made her blind. She could not believe he was dead. So, with the dead child in her arms she roamed for a medicine for his recovery. She was laughed and scorned at. She was agitated beyond measure. She was nearly going mad. One day, a good samaritan pointed the way to Jetavanàràma, where the Buddha was residing. When she went, the Buddha was discoursing to the monks and she stood at the end of the hall and entreated the Lord for the medicine that she had hitherto sought in vain. The Buddha saw her future. The Buddha saw that she was a stranger to death. So the Buddha asked her to bring some mustard seed. She felt that her child would recover soon and was about to set forth for the mustard. “But tarry a little,” the Buddha added, “that mustard seed must be brought from a house, meaning clan, that has not tasted death.”"},{"pageNumber":1166,"pageContent":"1166 However, she thought it was simple enough.

The truth gradu- ally dawned on her about the universality of death. The force of death overwhelmed her. She saw that the Buddha wanted to teach her the great lesson. She hurriedly took the corpse to the cemetery and kept it there remarking that he was not the only child to die. Her practice of meditation in the past came to her rescue. It was not diffi cult for her to realize that nothing endures forever. It was so in all planes of life, including the brahma world. Only an arahat passes away completely, never to be born again or to die again. She glimpsed that bliss. She returned a sadder and wiser woman. She no longer sought the medi- cine. She yearned for the higher prescription that would cure her once and for all. She begged of the great physician to minister to her mind’s disease. The Buddha’s diagnosis was incomparable. The Buddha preached. There were four powerful currents ( ogà ) that would hurl mortals to and fro in the ocean of saüsàra . The four currents are: (1) carnal pleasures ( kàma ); (2) clinging to existence ( bhava ); (3) attachment to various wrong beliefs ( diññhi ); (4) ignorance ( avijjà ).

There is no creature that is not subjected to death, nor is there any existing thing that is capable of abiding in the same condition. All beings are subjected to death, and all compounds are subjected to dissolution. But sages of old, when they lost a son, said, ‘That which is subjected to destruction is destroyed... and grieved not.” ‘And here- upon, at the man’s request He related a story of the past. Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Vàràõasã, the Bodhisatta was born in a bràhmin household, in a village outside the gates of Vàràõasã, and reared a family. He supported them by fi eld labour. He had two children, a son and a daughter. When the son was grown up, the father brought a wife home for him, from a family of equal rank with his own. Thus, with a female slave they composed a household of six; the Bodhisatta and his wife, the son and daughter, the daughter-in-law and female slave. They lived happily and affec- tionately together. The Bodhisatta thus admonished the other fi ve; “According as ye have received, give alms, observe holy days, keep the moral law, dwell on the thought of death, be mindful of your mortal state. For in the case of beings like ourselves, death is certain, life is uncertain: all existing things are transitory and subjected to decay. Therefore, take heed of your ways, day and night.” They readily accepted His Teaching and dwelt earnestly on the thought of death. Now one day, the Bodhisatta went with his son to plough his fi eld when the youth was bitten by a snake and fell down dead. The Bodhisatta, on seeing him fall, left his oxen and came to him, and fi nding that he was dead, he took him up and laid him at the foot of a certain tree, and covering him up with a cloak, he neither wept nor lamented. He said, “That which is subjected to dissolution is dissolved, and that which is subjected to death is dead. All compound existences are transitory and liable to death.” And recognizing the transitory"},{"pageNumber":1174,"pageContent":"1174 nature of things, he went on with his ploughing. Seeing a neighbour pass close by the fi eld, he asked, “Friend, are you going home?” And on his answering, “Yes,” he said, “Please then go to our house and say to the mistress, ‘You are not today as formerly to bring food for two, but to bring it for one only. And hitherto, the female slave alone has brought the food, but today all four of you are to put on clean gar- ments, and to come with perfumes and fl owers in your hands’” “All right,” he said, and went and spoke these very words to the bràhmin’s wife. She asked, “By whom, Sir, was this message given?” “By the bràhmin, lady,” he replied. She understood that her son was dead. But she did not so much as tremble. Thus showing perfect self-control, and wearing white garments and with perfumes and fl owers in her hand, she bade them bring food, and accompanied the other members of the family to the fi eld. But not one of them either shed a tear or made lamentation. The Bodhisatta still sitting in the shade where the youth lay, ate his food. And when his meal was fi nished, they all took up fi re-wood and lifting the body on to the funeral pile, they made offerings of perfumes and fl owers, and then set fi re to it. But not a single tear was shed by any one. All were dwelling on the thought of death. Such was the effi cacy of their virtue that the throne of Sakka manifested signs of heat. Sakka said, ‘Who, I wonder, is anxious to bring me down from my throne?” And on refl ection, he discovered that the heat was due to the force of virtue existing in these people, and being highly pleased he said, “I must go to them and utter a loud cry of exultation like the roaring of a lion, and immediately after- wards fi ll their dwelling place with the seven treasures.” And going there in haste he stood by the side of the funeral pyre and said, “What are you doing?” ‘We are burning the body of a man, my Lord.” “It is no man that you are burning,” he said, “I think you are roasting the fl esh of some beast that you have slain.” “Not so, my Lord,” they said. “It is merely the body of a man that we are burning.” Then he said, “It must have been some enemy.” The Bodhisatta said, “It is our own true son, and no enemy.” “Then he could not have been dear as a son to you.”"},{"pageNumber":1175,"pageContent":"1175 “He was very dear, my Lord.” “Then why do you not weep?” Then the Bodhisatta, to explain the reason why he did not weep, spoke the fi rst stanza: Man quits his mortal frame, when joy in life is past, E’en as a snake is wont, its worn out slough to cast; No friend’s lament can touch the ashes of the dead: Why should I grieve: He fares the way he had to tread. Sakka, on hearing the words of the Bodhisatta, asked the bràhmin’s wife, “How, lady, did the dead man stand to you?” “I sheltered him ten months in my womb, and suckled him at my breast, and directed the movements of his hands and feet, and he was my grown up son, my Lord.” “Granted, lady, that a father from the nature of a man may not weep, a mother’s heart surely is tender. Why then do you not weep?” And to explain why she did not weep, she spoke a couple of stanzas: Uncalled he hither came, unbidden soon to go; Even as he came, he went. What cause is here for woe? No friend’s lament can touch the ashes of the dead: Why should I grieve? He fares the way he had to tread.

This was followed by an epidemic of diseases, and as people could hardly cope with the disposal of the corpses there was a lot of stench in the air. This stench attracted the ogres. The people of Vesàli were facing the dangers of destruction by famine, disease and also by the ogres. In their grief and sorrow they tried to look for a refuge. They thought of going for help from various sources but fi nally, they decided to invite the Buddha.

Thus, the feud con- tinued for fi ve hundred existences of the two beings. At the time of the Buddha one of them was born as a woman and the other a female spirit. On one occasion, the woman was returning from the house of her parents to her own house near Sàvatthi. Her hus- band and her young son were also with her. While they were resting near a pond at the roadside, her husband went to have a bath in the pond. At that moment the woman saw the female spirit and recognized her as her old enemy. Taking her child she fl ed from the female spirit straight to the Jetavana Monastery where the Buddha was expounding the Dhamma and put her child at the feet of the Buddha. The female spirit who was in hot pursuit of the woman also came to the door of the monastery, but the guardian spirit of the gate did not permit her to enter. The Buddha, seeing her, sent the Venerable ânanda to bring the female spirit to his presence. When the female spirit arrived, the"},{"pageNumber":1183,"pageContent":"1183 Buddha reprimanded both the woman and the female spirit for the long chain of feuding between them. He also added, “If you two had not come to me today, your feud would have continued endlessly. Enmity cannot be appeased by enmity; it can only be appeased by loving-kindness.” He who seeks his own happiness by infl icting pain on others, being entangled by bonds of enmity, cannot be free from enmity. At the end of the discourse, the female spirit took refuge in the three gems, viz., the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and the woman attained sotàpatti fruition.

On the other hand, the cemetery meditations ( sãvathikà ) mentioned in the fi rst satipaññhàna are nearly the same as the ten contemplations of loathsomeness ( asubha-bhàvanà ) whereas elsewhere the contemplation on the thirty-two parts of the body is called the refl ection on impurity ( pañikkåla-sa¤¤à ).

It is the contempla- tion on the body,” the reference is to all exercises mentioned in the fi rst satipaññhàna .

Now, just as one repeats the exercise in words, one should do it also in mind. The repeating in mind forms the condition for the penetration of the char- acteristic marks. He who thus has examined the parts of the body as to colour, shape, region, locality and limits, and considers them one by one, and not too hurriedly, as something loathsome, to such a one, while contemplating the body, all these things at the same time are appearing distinctly clear. But also when keeping one’s attention fi xed outwardly such as to the bodies of other beings, and when all the parts appear distinctly, then all men and animals moving about lose the appearance of living beings and appear like heaps of many different things. And it looks as if those foods and drinks, being taken by them, were being inserted into this heap. Now, while again one is conceiving the idea ‘disgusting!’ – omitting in due course sev- eral parts – gradually the attainment-concentration ( appanà-samàdhi , i.e., the concentration of the jhàna ) will be reached.

So, they entreated the Buddha to make it clear to them and the Buddha explained the meaning to them. In the above statement, the Buddha was referring to an arahat, who had eradicated craving, conceit, wrong beliefs, and attachment to sense bases and sense objects. The Buddha had made the statement by means of metaphors. Thus, the terms mother and father are used to indicate craving and conceit respectively. The eternity-belief ( sassatadiññhi ) and annihilation- belief ( ucchedadiññhi ) are likened to two kings, attachment is liked to a revenue offi cer and the sense bases and sense objects (the ajjhatta and bahiddha àyatanas ) are likened to a kingdom."},{"pageNumber":1193,"pageContent":"1193 Explanatory Translation (Verse 294) màtaraü pitaraü dve ca khattiye ràjàno hantvà sànucaraü raññhaü hantvà bràhmano anãgho yàti màtaraü : the mother (craving); pitaraü : father (egotism); dve ca khattiye ràjàno : the two warrior kings also; hantvà : having assassinated; sànucaraü : along with their subordinate; raññhaü : the kingdom; hantvà : having destroyed; bràhmano : the saint (who has got rid of blemishes); anãgho yàti : goes without any trepidation The bràhmin kills the mother – craving; kills the father – ego- tism, self-esteem; kills the two warrior kings.

Commentary These two verses indicate the variety of wrong views that have to be destroyed by a seeker who is bent on achieving the highest fruits of spiritual life. These views come within the category of diññhi . The word means view, belief, speculative opinion, insight. If not qualifi ed by sammà (right), it mostly refers to wrong and evil view or opinion, and only in a few instances to right view, under- standing or insight (e.g. diññhi-ppatta , diññhi visuddhi , purifi cation of insight; diññhi-sampanna , possessed of insight). Wrong or evil views ( diññhi or micchà-diññhi ) are declared as utterly rejectable for being a source of wrong and evil aspirations and conduct, and liable at times to lead man to the deepest abysses of depravity. So stated the Buddha said: No other thing than evil views do I know, O’ monks whereby to such an extent the unwholesome things not yet arisen arise, and the unwholesome things already arisen are brought to growth and fullness. No other thing than evil views do I know, whereby to such an extent the wholesome things not yet arisen are hindered in their arising, and the wholesome things already arisen disappear. No other thing than evil views do I know, whereby to such an extent human being at the dissolution of the body, at death are"},{"pageNumber":1196,"pageContent":"1196 passing to a way of suffering, into a world of woe, into hell. Whatever a man fi lled with evil views performs or undertakes, or whatever he possesses of will, aspiration, longing and tendencies, all these things lead him to an undesirable, unpleasant and disagreeable state, to woe and suffering. From the Abhidhamma it may be inferred that evil views, whenever they arise, are associated with greed. Numerous speculative opinions and theories, which at all times have infl uenced and still are infl uencing mankind, are quoted in the Sutta texts. Amongst them, however, the wrong view which every- where, and at all times, has most misled and deluded mankind is the personality-belief, the ego-illusion. This personality-belief ( sakkàya- diññhi ), or ego-illusion ( atta-diññhi ), is of two kinds: eternity-belief and annihilation-belief. Eternity-belief ( sassata-diññhi ) is the belief in the existence of a persisting ego-entity, soul or personality as being, more or less, identi- cal with those physical and mental processes, and which therefore, at the dissolution at death, will come to be annihilated. Now, the Buddha neither teaches a personality which will con- tinue after death, nor does he teach a personality which will be anni- hilated at death, but he shows us that personality, ego, individual, and so on are nothing but mere conventional designations ( vohàra-vacana ) and that in the ultimate sense ( pamattha-sacca ) there is only this self- consuming process of physical and mental phenomena which con- tinually arise and again disappear immediately. The Buddha is free from any theory ( diññhigata ), for the Buddha has seen what corporeality is, and how it arises and passes away. He has seen what feeling... perception... mental formations... conscious- ness are, and how they arise and pass away. Therefore I say that the Buddha has won complete deliverance through the extinction, fading away, disappearance, rejection and casting out of all imaginings and conjectures, of all inclination to the vain-glory based on ego."},{"pageNumber":1197,"pageContent":"1197 The rejection of speculative views and theories is a prominent feature in a chapter of the Sutta-Nipàta , the Aññhaka-vagga . The so-called evil views with fi xed destiny ( niyata-micchàdiññhi ) constituting the last of the ten unwholesome courses of action ( kammapatha ,) are the following three: ( 1) the fatalistic view of the uncausedness of existence ( ahetuka-diññhi ). This was taught by Makkhali-Gosàla, a contemporary of the Buddha who denied every cause for the corruptness and purity of beings, and asserted that everything is minutely predestined by fate. (2) the view of the ineffi cacy of action ( akiriya-diññhi ). This was taught by Påraõa-Kassapa, another contemporary of the Buddha, who denied every kammical effect of good and bad actions. To him who kills, steals, robs and so on, nothing bad will happen. As for generosity, self-restraint and truthfulness and so on, no reward is to be expected. (3) Nihilism ( natthika-diññhi ). This was taught by Ajita-Kesakaübali, a third contemporary of the Buddha, who asserted that any belief in good action and its reward, is a mere delusion, that after death no further life would follow, that man at death would become dissolved into the elements. Frequently mentioned are also the ten antinomies ( antagàhikà micchà- diññhi ): fi nite is the world or infi nite is the world... body and soul are identical or body and soul are different. In the Brahmajàla Sutta sixty-two false views are classifi ed and described, comprising all conceivable wrong views and speculations about man and the world. Wrong views ( diññhi ) are one of the proclivities ( anusaya ), can- kers ( àsava ), clingings ( upàdàna ), one of the three modes of perversions ( vipallàsa ).

Once, in Ràjagaha, a wood cutter went into the woods with his son to cut some fi rewood. On their return home in the evening, they stopped near a cemetery to have their meal. They also took off the yoke from the two oxen to enable them to graze nearby; but the two oxen went away without being noticed by them.

So one of them remained near the boy, guarding him from all dangers; the other went to the king’s palace and brought the food tray of King Bimbisàra. The two evil spirits then fed the boy as if he were their own son. At the palace, the evil spirit left a writ- ten message concerning the royal food tray; and this message was visible only to the king. In the morning, the king’s men discovered that the royal food tray was missing and they were very upset and very much frightened. The king found the message left by the evil spirit and directed his men where to look for it. The king’s men found the royal food tray among the fi rewood in the cart. They also found the boy who was still sleeping underneath the cart. When questioned, the boy answered that his parents came to feed him in the night and that he went to sleep con- tentedly and without fear after taking his food. The boy knew only that much and nothing more. The king sent for the par- ents of the boy, and took the boy and his parents to the Buddha. The king, by that time, had heard that the boy was always mindful of the unique qualities of the Buddha and also that he had cried out “ Namo Buddhassa ” when the evil spirit pulled at his leg in the night. The king asked the Buddha, “Is mindfulness of the unique qualities of the Buddha the only dhamma that gives one protection against evil and danger, or is mindfulness of the unique qualities of the Dhamma equally potent and pow- erful?” To him, the Buddha replied, “O king, my disciple!

The word anussati means refl ection. Therefore buddhànussati bhàvanà means the meditation practiced while refl ecting on the virtues of the Buddha. The Buddha has infi nite virtues. But these are incorporated in nine main virtues. They are called the ninefold virtues of the Buddha enumerated as Itipiso bhagavà ... Buddhànussati bhàvanà has to be prac- ticed while refl ecting on these virtues. It is diffi cult to meditate while refl ecting on all the virtues of the Buddha at the same time. Therefore, it is much easier to refl ect on one out of many such virtues. Later one could practice medita- tion, refl ecting on all the virtues. One could start with the fi rst virtue, namely arahat , and proceed in the following manner: Firstly, one should clean oneself and worship the Triple Gem with offerings of fl owers and then seek the three-fold refuge and observe the fi ve precepts. Thereafter, seated in a convenient posture before a statue of the Buddha, one should strive to create the image of the Buddha in one’s own mind by looking at it with love and adora- tion. Then closing the eyes and placing the right hand on the left, one should think thus while being cognizant of the fact that the Buddha is present in one’s mind.

The meditation could be considered as the most diffi cult in the satipaññhàna meditation series. There are fi ve main parts of dhammànupassanà bhàvanà , such as: (1) Vivarana pariggaha , (2) khandha pariggaha , (3) àyatana pariggaha , (4) bojjhanga pariggaha , and (5) sacca pariggaha . Nivàrana pariggaha : There are fi ve hindrances that obstruct the path to Nibbàna. They are called Nivàrana . They are: (1) kàmacchanda , (2) vyàpàda , (3) thãnamiddha , (4) uddhacca kukkucca , and (5) vicikicchà . kàmacchanda : means sense desire. This arises as a result of consider- ing objects as satisfactory. One should refl ect on kàmacchanda in the following fi ve ways: (1) when a sense-desire ( kàmacchanda ), arises in one’s mind to be aware of its presence; (2) when there is no sense-desire in one’s mind to be aware of its absence; (3) to be aware of the way in which a sense-desire not hitherto arisen in one’s mind would come into being; (4) to be aware of the way in which a sense-desire arisen in one’s mind would cease to be; (5) to be aware of the way in which a sense-desire which ceased to exist in one’s mind would not come into existence again. vyàpàda : This means ill-will. It distorts the mind and blocks the path to Nibbàna. One should refl ect on vyàpàda in the following fi ve ways:"},{"pageNumber":1210,"pageContent":"1210 (1) when there arises ill-will ( Vyàpàda ) in one’s mind, to be aware of its presence; (2) when there is no ill-will in one’s mind, to be aware of its absence; (3) to be aware of the way in which ill-will not hitherto arisen in one’s mind would come into being; (4) to be aware of the way in which ill-will arisen in one’s mind would cease to be; (5) to be aware of the way in which ill-will which ceased to exist in one’s mind would not come into existence again. thãnamiddha : This means sloth in mind and body. This should also be refl ected on, in the fi ve ways described earlier as in the case of kàmacchanda and vyàpàda . uddhacca kukkucca : This means restlessness and worry that arises in the mind. This mental agitation prevents calmness and is a hindrance to the path to Nibbàna. This also should be refl ected on, in the fi ve ways already referred to. vicikicchà : This means skeptical doubt that arises over the following 8 factors regarding the doctrine, namely: (1) doubt regarding the Buddha; (2) doubt regarding the Dhamma; (3) doubt regarding the Sangha; (4) doubt regarding the precepts ( sikkhà ); (5) doubt regarding one’s previous birth; (6) doubt regarding one’s next birth; (7) doubt regarding one’s previous birth and the next birth; (8) doubt regarding the doctrine of dependent origination ( paticca samuppàda )."},{"pageNumber":1211,"pageContent":"1211 This also should be refl ected on, in the fi ve ways referred to earlier. The refl ection on the fi vefold hindrances ( nãvarana ) taken separately is called nãvarana pariggaha . khandha pariggaha : A being is composed of fi ve aggregates of cling- ing. This is the group that grasps life which is based in: (1) the aggregate of matter ( råpa upàdànakkhandha ); (2) the aggregate of sensation or feelings ( vedanà upàdàna-kkhandha ); (3) the aggregate of perceptions ( sa¤¤à upàdànakkhandha ); (4) the aggregate of mental formations ( samkhàra upàdàna kkhandha ); (5) the aggregate of consciousness ( vi¤¤àna upàdànakkhandha ). One should refl ect on matter ( råpa ) in the following way: Matter is of worldly nature. Matter has come into existence in this manner. Matter will cease to be in this manner. The same procedure should be adopted in refl ecting on the other aggregates of clinging as well. The aim of this meditation is to get rid of any attachment towards these aggregates and to realize their impermanent nature. àyatana pariggaha : âyatana means sense-bases. They are twelve in number and are divided into two parts – external and internal. The six internal sense-bases ( adhyàtma àyatana ) are: (1) eye – chakkàyatana , (2) ear – sotàyatana , (3) nose – ghànàyatana , (4) tongue – jivhàyatana , (5) body – kàyàyatana , and (6) mind – manà- yatana . The six external sense-bases ( bàhiràyatana ) are: (1) form – råpàyatana , (2) sound – saddàyatana , (3) smell – gandhà yatana , (4) taste – rasàyatana , (5) contact – poññhabbàyatana , and (6) mental objects – dhammàyatana . Taking each of these sense-base one should refl ect on them in the fol- lowing fi ve ways:"},{"pageNumber":1212,"pageContent":"1212 (1) knowing what it is, (2) knowing how it has come into being, (3) knowing how a sense-base not arisen hitherto comes into being, (4) knowing how a sense-base that has come into being ceases to be, and (5) knowing how a sense-base which has ceased to be does not come into being again. Once this meditation is practiced with regard to oneself, it could be extended to others as well. bojjhanga pariggaha : Bojjhanga , or factors of enlightenment, means the conditions that a person striving for enlightenment should follow. They are seven in number: (1) sati sambojjhanga , (2) dhamma vicaya sambojjhanga , (3) viriya sambojjhanga , (4) pãti sambojjhanga , (5) pas- saddhi sambojjhanga , (6) samàdhi sambojjhanga , (7) upekkhà sambojjhanga . These seven conditions beginning with sati are stages that gradually arise in a person striving for enlightenment and are related to one another. Therefore, it is diffi cult to describe them separately. The person who strives for enlightenment acts being mindful of all his thoughts and activities of the body. Such mindfulness is called sati here. With such mindfulness he distinguishes between right and wrong and examines them with wisdom. Such critical examination is called dhammavicaya . This factor of enlightenment connected with wisdom develops in a person striving for enlightenment. The effort of such a person in order to cultivate right ( dhamma ) having got rid of wrong ( adhamma ) is here called viriya . The viriya sambojjhanga develops in a person, who strives thus. The happiness that arises in one’s mind by the establishment and the development of right ( dhamma ) is called pãti sambojjhanga . The calmness that arises in the mind and the body by the development of happiness devoid of sense-desires is called passaddhi . The passaddhi sambojjhanga develops in a person who fol- lows this procedure. Concentrating the mind on a good ( kusala ) object based on this calmness constitutes the samàdhi sambojjhanga . With the development of concentration one realizes the futility of sensations and develops a sense of equanimity ( upekkhà ) being unaffected by happiness and sorrow. This is called upekkhà sambojjhanga ."},{"pageNumber":1213,"pageContent":"301. Suppabuddhaü pabujjhanti sadà Gotamasàvakà yesaü divà ca ratto ca bhàvanàya rato mano.

By refl ecting in this manner it would be possible to develop the seven- fold factors which assist one to attain Nibbàna. sacca pariggaha : This means the realization of facts regarding the four noble truths, namely: (1) dukkha , (2) samudaya , (3) nirodha , and (4) magga . dukkha : The truth of suffering: according to the Buddha’s Teaching the entire world, which is in a state of fl ux, is full of suffering. The Buddha has shown the path to end that suffering. There are twelve ways in which this suffering could be explained. (1) Birth is suffering ( jàti ); (2) Old age is suffering ( jarà ); (3) Death is suffering ( maraõa ); (4) Sorrow is suffering ( soka ); (5) Lamentation is suffering ( parideva ); (6) Physical pain is suffering ( dukkha ); (7) Mental pain is suffering ( domanassa );"},{"pageNumber":1215,"pageContent":"1215 (8) Laborious exertion is suffering ( upàyàsa ); (9) Association with unpleasant persons and conditions is suffering ( appiyehisampayoga ); (10) Separation from beloved ones and pleasant conditions is suffering ( piyehivippayoga ); (11) Not getting what one desires is suffering ( yampiccam nalabhati tampi dukkaü ); (12) In short, the fi ve aggregates of attachment are suffering ( samkhittena pa¤cupàdànakkhandhà dukkhà ). The conception of suffering may also be viewed from seven aspects, as: (1) suffering arising from physical pain (dukkha), (2) suffering arising from change ( viparinàmadukkha ), (3) suffering arising from the coming into being and cessation of conditional states ( samkhatadukkha ), (4) suffering arising from physical and mental ailments but whose cause of arising is concealed ( pañicchannadukkha ), (5) suffering arising from various trials and tribulations and whose causes of arising are evident ( appañicchanna dukkha ), (6) suffering arising from all the types other than dukkha-dukkha ( pariyàyadukkha ), and (7) physical and men- tal suffering called dukkha-dukkha ( nippariyàya dukkha ). Thus one should refl ect on suffering in various ways, consider- ing the fact that it is a state conditioned by cause and effect. In this way one should strive to realize the true nature of suffering. Samudaya : The truth of arising of suffering: by this is meant crav- ing which is the root cause of all suffering. It is primarily threefold: (1) kàma (attachment for worldly objects), (2) bhava (attachment for continuity and becoming), and (3) vibhava (attachment with the idea that there is no continuity and becoming). This craving is further clas- sifi ed in relation to the various sense-objects: (1) råpa taõhà (craving for form), (2) sadda taõhà (craving for sound), (3) gandha taõhà (craving for smell), (4) rasa taõhà (craving for taste),"},{"pageNumber":1216,"pageContent":"1216 (5) poññhabba taõhà (craving for contact), and (6) dhamma taõhà (craving for mental objects). Nirodha : Truth of the cessation of suffering: this means the supreme state of Nibbàna resulting from the elimination of all defi lements. It is two-fold, namely: (1) attaining Nibbàna and continuing to live ( sopadisesa nirvàna ), and (2) attaining Nibbàna at death ( nirupàdisesa Nirvàna ). Magga : The noble eight-fold path, which is the only way to attain Nirvàna, is meant by magga which comprises: (1) right understanding ( sammàdiññhi ); (2) right thought ( sammàsankappa ); (3) right speech ( sammàvàcà ); (4) right action ( sammàkammanta ); (5) right livelihood ( sammà àjãva ); (6) right effort ( sammàvàyàmà ); (7) right mindfulness ( sammàsati ); (8) right concentration ( sammà samàdhi ). Each of these factors should be taken separately and refl ected on and one should strive to practice them thoughtfully in everyday life. One should be mindful of one’s thoughts and strive to get rid of evil thoughts and foster right thoughts ( sammà saõkappa ) by practicing right understanding ( Sammàdiññhi ). Consequently one should be able to restrain one’s body, speech and mind and through right concentra- tion ( sammà samàdhi ) be able to focus the mind towards the attainment of Nibbàna.

The practice of this meditation diligently will enable one to tread the path to Nibbàna. According to the visuddhimagga and other important Buddhist texts it is imperative for one who practises this meditation to associate with a learned and noble teacher. This is extremely important because in the absence of such a teacher a person desirous of practicing this meditation could be misled. By practicing the various sections of the satipaññhàna meditation as part of the daily routine, one would also be able to control and adjust one’s life in a successful manner and thereby lead a household life of peace and contentment. ahimsàya rato : Takes delight in non-violence, positively takes delight in cultivating loving-kindness. A very special characteristic of the Teaching of the Buddha is the central position given in it to the need to be kind to all beings. Loving-kindness, mettà , the practice of which ensures non-violence, has been extensively dwelt upon by the Buddha. In his exhortation to Ràhula, the Buddha said: Cultivate, Ràhula, the meditation on loving-kindness; for by cultivating loving-kindness ill-will is banished. Cultivate, Ràhula, the meditation on compassion; for by cultivating compassion harm and cruelty are banished. From this it is clear that mettà and karunà are diametrically opposed to ill-will and cruelty respectively. Ill-will or hate, like sense desire (lust), is also caused by the sense faculties meeting sense objects. When a man’s eye comes in contact with a visible object, which to his way of thinking is unpleasant and undesirable, then repugnance arises if he does not exercise systematic wise attention. It is the same with ear and sound, nose and smell, tongue and taste, body and contact, mind and mental objects. Even agreeable things, both animate and inanimate, which fi ll man with great pleasure can cause aversion and ill-will. A person, for instance, may woo another whom he loves and entertain thoughts of sensual affection, but if"},{"pageNumber":1218,"pageContent":"1218 the loved one fails to show the same affection or behaves quite con- trary to expectation, confl icts and resentment arise. If he then fails to exercise systematic attention, if he is not prudent, he may behave foolishly, and his behaviour may lead to disaster, even to murder or suicide. Such is the danger of these passions that they will have to be tamed by mettà . mettà : is a popular term among Buddhists, yet no English word conveys its exact meaning. Friendliness, benevolence, good-will, uni- versal love, loving-kindness are the favourite renderings. Mettà is the wish for the welfare and happiness of all beings, making no restric- tions whatsoever. It has the characteristic of a benevolent friend. Its direct enemy is ill-will (hatred) while the indirect or masked enemy is carnal love or selfi sh affectionate desire ( pema , Skt. pema ) which is quite different from mettà . Carnal love when disguised as mettà can do much harm to oneself and others. One has to be on one’s guard against this masked enemy. Very often people entertain thoughts of sensual affection, and mistaking it for real mettà think that they are cultivating mettà , and do not know that they are on the wrong track. If one were dispassionately to scrutinize such thoughts one would realize that they are tinged with sensuous attachment. If the feeling of love is the direct result of attachment and clinging, then it really is not mettà . Carnal love or pema is a kind of longing capable of producing much distress, sorrow and lamentation. This fact is clearly explained by the Buddha in the discourses, and fi ve verses of chapter sixteen on affection in the Dhammapada emphasize it thus: From what is beloved grief arises, From what is beloved arises fear. For him who is free from what he loves There is no grief and so no fear. From affection, grief arises... From attachment, grief arises..."},{"pageNumber":1219,"pageContent":"1219 From lust grief arises... From craving grief arises... As is well known, to love someone means to develop an attachment to the loved one, and when the latter is equally fond of you a bond is created, but when you are separated or when the dear one’s affection towards you wanes, you become miserable and may even behave fool- ishly. In his formulation of the noble truth of suffering, the Buddha says: Association with the unloved is suffering, separation from the loved is suffering, not to get what one wants is suffering... Mettà , however, is a very pure sublime state of the human, like quicksilver it cannot attach itself to anything. It is a calm, non-assertive super- solvent among virtues. It is diffi cult to love a person dispassionately, without any kind of clinging, without any idea of self, me and mine; for in man the notion of ‘I’ is dominant, and to love without making any distinc- tion between this and that, without setting barriers between persons, to regard all as sisters and brothers with a boundless heart, may appear to be almost impossible, but those who try even a little will be rewarded; it is worth while. Through continuous effort and determi- nation one reaches the destination by stages. A practiser of mettà should be on his guard against callous folk who are egocentric. It often happens that when a person is gentle and sincere others try to exploit his good qualities for their own ends. This should not be encouraged. If one allows the self-centred to make unfair use of one’s mettà , kindliness and tolerance, that tends to inten- sify rather than allay the evils and sufferings of society."},{"pageNumber":1220,"pageContent":"302.

On the night of the full moon day of Kattika, the people of Vesàli celebrated the festival of the constellations ( nakkhatta ) on a grand scale. The whole city was lit up, and there was much merry-making with singing, dancing, etc. As he looked towards the city, standing alone in the monastery, the monk felt lonely and dissatisfi ed with his lot. Softly, he murmured to himself, “There can be no one whose lot is worse than m i ne.” At t h at i n st a nt, t he spi r it g ua rd i ng t he wood s appea red to him, and said, “Those beings in niraya envy the lot of the beings in the deva world; so also, people envy the lot of those who live alone in the woods.” Hearing those words, the monk realized the truth of those words and he regretted that he had thought so little of the lot of a monk. Early in the morning the next day, the monk went to the Buddha and reported the matter to him. In reply, the Buddha told him about the hardships in the life of all beings.

Commentary saüsàra : round of rebirth, lit. perpetual wandering. Saüsàra is a name by which is designated the sea of life, ever restlessly heaving up and down, the symbol of this continuous process of ever and again being born, grow- ing old, suffering and dying. More precisely put, saüsàra is the unbroken chain of the fi ve-fold khanda- combinations, which, constantly changing from moment to moment, follow continuously one upon the other through inconceivable periods of time. Of this saüsàra , a single lifetime constitutes only a tiny and fl eeting fraction; hence to be able to comprehend the fi rst noble truth of universal suffering, one must let one’s gaze rest upon the saüsàra , upon this frightful chain of rebirths, and not merely upon one single lifetime, which of course, may sometimes be less painful. The Buddha said: O’ monks, this cycle of continuity ( saüsàra ) is without a visible end, and the fi rst beginning of beings wandering and running around, enveloped in ignorance ( avijjà ) and bound down by the fetters of thirst (desire, taõhà ) is not to be perceived....

Anàthapiõóika and Ugga, the rich man from Ugga, studied under the same teacher when they were both young. Ugga had a son while Anàthapiõóika had a daughter. When their children came of age, Ugga asked for the consent of Anàthapiõóika to the marriage of their two children.

The Buddha was accom- panied by a multitude of monks on this trip; they all came through the air in decorated fl oats created by the order of Sakka, king of the devas. Seeing the Buddha in his splendour and glory, the parents-in-law of Cålasubhaddà were very much impressed and they paid homage to the Buddha.

All alone, he would sleep or lie down, or stand, or walk. Other monks thought ill of Ekavihàri and told the Buddha about him. But the Buddha did not blame him.

This stanza was spoken by the Buddha to extol the virtues of a monk who took delight in forest- dwelling. The special qualities of the forest for a monk in meditation are given this way. According to the explanation given in the vinaya , a forest embraces all that which lies outside a village and its precincts. The Abhidhamma states that the forest commences when one passes the village-outpost. But, in regard to ascetic practices, as we learn from the Suttanta explanation, a forest-dwelling is said to be at least fi ve hundred bow-lengths distant from the village boundary. The following are the advantages of living in the forest: a monk who lives in a forest can easily acquire concentration not yet acquired, or develop that which has already been attained. Moreover, his teacher is pleased with him, just as the Buddha said: I am pleased with the forest-life of the monk, Nàgita. The mind of him who lives in a forest-dwelling is not distracted by undesirable objects. As he is sustained by the necessary qualifi cation of moral purity he is not overcome, when living in the forest, by the terrors which are expe- rienced by those who are impure in word, deed and thought; this is stated in the Bhayabherava Sutta : Putting away all craving for life, he enjoys the blissful happiness of calm and solitude. In the words of the visuddhi-magga : Secluded, detached, delighting in solitude, The monk by his forest-life endears himself unto the Buddha. Living alone in the forest he obtains that bliss, Which even the gods with Indra do not taste. Wearing but paüsukåla as his armour to the forest battlefi eld armed with other ascetic vows, He, before long, shall conquer Màra and his army. So the wise should delight in the forest-life."},{"pageNumber":1234,"pageContent":"Chapter 22 Niraya Vagga Hell"},{"pageNumber":1235,"pageContent":"306.

As the number of people who revered the Buddha increased, the non-Buddhist ascetics found that the number of their followers was dwindling. Therefore, they became very jealous of the Buddha; they were also afraid that things would get worse if they did not do something to damage the reputation of the Buddha. So, they sent for Sundarã and said to her, “Sundarã, you are a very beautiful and clever young lady. We want you to put Samana Gotama to shame, by mak- ing it appear to others that you are having sexual dealings with him. By so doing, his image will be impaired, his follow- ing will decrease and many would come to us. Make the best use of your looks and be crafty. Sundarã understood what was expected of her. Thus, late in the evening, she went in the direction of the Jetavana Monastery. When she was asked where she was going, she answered, “I am going to visit Samana Gotama; I live with him in the perfumed chamber of the Jetavana Monastery.” After saying this, she proceeded to the place of the non- Buddhist ascetics.

The king gave them permission to search where they wished. Finding the body near the Jetavana Monastery, they carried it to the palace. Then they said to the king, “O king, the followers of Gotama have killed this Paribbàjikà and have thrown away her body in the rubbish heap near the Jetavana Monastery to cover up the misdeed of their teacher.” To them the king replied, “In that case, you may go round the town and proclaim the fact.” So they went round the town carrying the dead body of Sun- darã, shouting, “Look what the followers of Gotama have done! See how they have tried to cover up the misdeed of Gotama!” The procession then returned to the palace. The monks living in the Jetavana Monastery told the Buddha what those ascetics were doing to damage his reputation and impair his image. But the Buddha only said, “My sons, you just tell them this,” and then spoke in verse as follows: Explanatory Translation (Verse 306) abhåtavàdã nirayaü upeti pi ca yo katvà na karomi iti ca àha nihãnakammà te ubho manujà àpi pecca parattha samà bhavanti"},{"pageNumber":1238,"pageContent":"1238 abhåtavàdã : he who utters lies; api yo katvà : and he having committed sins; na karomãti : will say I did not commit; àha : if he says this; nirayaü upeti : (he) will go to hell; nihãnakammà : of depraved acts; te ubho àpi manujà : both these types of person; pecca : having departed this world; parattha : in the next world; samà bhavanti : become similar One who tells lies about others goes to hell ( niraya ); one who has done evil and says “I did not do it”, also goes to hell.

On investigation, they found out that Sundarã had died at the hands of some drunkards. So they were brought to the king. When questioned, the drunk- ards disclosed that they were hired by the ascetics to kill Sundarã and put her body near the Jetavana Monastery. The king then sent for the non-Buddhist ascetics, and they fi nally confessed their role in the murder of Sundarã. The king then ordered them to go round the town and confess their guilt to the people. So they went round the town say- ing, “We are the ones who killed Sundarã.

Since that time he had heaped up much merit and fi nally he was born a bràhmin by the name of Lakkhana. His circle was Uruwela Kàsyapa and his two brothers Gayà and Nadã. With their con- version, he, too, later became an arahat. He was a friend and companion to Mahà Moggallàna. In the course of their travels, they came across a non-human spirit on the top of Vulture’s Peak (Gijjakåta) who was in one of the four states of woe, viz., pretha (ghost realm). The others are hell, animal and demon states. He had the shape of a crow and was emitting fl ames. On being questioned about the reason for his suffering he said that once upon a time he was born as a bird in the family of the robin. During the dispensation of Kassapa Buddha, while people were offering alms to monks, this bird suddenly fl ew in that direction and snatched three mouthfuls of rice and fl ew away. It was the result of that action. On another occasion, on the same spot, while the same pair was going, Mahà Moggallàna only saw a serpent with its immense length enveloped in fl ames, with a human face and a mouth like that of a pig. Venerable Mahà Moggallàna smiled but put off giving the reason of the smile till they met the Buddha. Venerable Lakkhana waited for the opportunity and then asked. The Venerable Moggallàna explained that while sympathising with suffering of that being, yet it was with a sigh of relief that he smiled, because for him such states of suffering were no longer possible. The Buddha concurred, and said that He, too, after Enlightenment at Gayà, saw the same serpent but did not wish to say anything as there would be skeptics. What a Buddha discloses, it would be a lapse for anyone not to believe. Besides, a Buddha’s utterance is well- timed. This applies to scientifi c developments about which the Buddha was silent.

Commentary vassa : This verse was spoken by the Buddha with reference to a group of monks who spent the vassa (the rainy season) on the bank of the Vaggumudà River. In ancient times, as today, three regular seasons prevailed in India, namely, vassàna (rainy) hemanta (winter) and gimhàna (hot). The vassàna or rainy season starts in Asàtha and extends up to Assayuga , that is approximately from the middle of July to the middle of November. During the vassàna period, due to torrential rains, rivers and streams usu- ally get fl ooded, roads get inundated, communications get interrupted and peo- ple as a rule are confi ned to their homes and villages and live on what provisions they have collected during the previous seasons. During this time the ascetics fi nd it diffi cult to engage in their preaching tours, wandering from place to place. An infi nite variety of vegetable and animal life also appears to such an extent that people could not move about without unconsciously destroying them. Accord- ingly, all ascetics including the disciples of the Buddha, used to suspend their itinerant activities and live in retirement in solitary places. As a rule the Buddha and His disciples were invited to spend their rainy seasons either in a monastery or in a secluded park. Sometimes, however, they used to retire to forests. During these rainy seasons people fl ocked to the Buddha to hear the Dhamma and thus availed themselves of His presence in their vicinity to their best advantage."},{"pageNumber":1245,"pageContent":"309.

Khema was also the nephew of the renowned Anàthapiõóika. Khema, in addition to being rich, was also very good looking and women were very much attracted to him. They could hardly resist him and naturally fell prey to him. Khema committed adultery without compunction.

The Buddhist theory of action is embodied primarily in the Buddha’s teachings on kamma. Kamma is an impersonal, natural law that operates in accordance with our actions. It is a law in itself and does not have any lawgiver. Kamma operates in its own fi eld without the intervention of an exter- nal, independent, ruling agent. Kamma can be explained in many different ‘languages.’ Kamma can be put in the simple language of the child: Do good and good will come to you, now and in the future. Do bad and bad will come to you, now and in the future. In the language of the harvest, kamma can be explained in this way: If you sow good seeds, you will reap a good harvest. If you sow bad seeds, you will reap a bad harvest. In the language of science, kamma is called the law of cause and effect. Another name for this is the law of moral causation. Moral causation works in the moral realm just as the law of action and reac- tion works in the physical realm. In the Dhammapada, kamma is explained in this manner: The mind is the chief (forerunner) of all good states. If you speak or act with a good mind, then happiness follows you just as the wheel fol- lows the hoof of the ox. Kamma is simply action. Within animate organisms there is a power or force which is given different names such as instinctive ten- dencies, consciousness, etc. This innate propensity forces every con- scious being to move. He moves mentally or physically, His motion is action. The repetition of actions is habit and habit becomes his charac- ter. In Buddhism, this process is called kamma. In its ultimate sense, kamma means both good and bad, men- tal action or volition. “Kamma is volition,” says the Buddha. Thus"},{"pageNumber":1256,"pageContent":"312.

It is our own doings reacting on ourselves The pain and happiness man experiences are the results of his own deeds, words, and thoughts reacting on themselves. Our deeds, words and thoughts produce our prosperity and failure, our happiness and misery. Kamma is an impersonal, natural law that operates strictly in accordance with our actions. It is a law in itself and does not have any law-giver. Kamma operates in its own fi eld without the inter- vention of an external, independent ruling agency. Since there is no hidden agent directing or administrating rewards and punishments, Buddhists do not rely on prayer to infl uence any supernatural forces. According to the Buddha, kamma is neither predestination nor some sort of determinism imposed on us by some mysterious unknown powers or forces to which we must helplessly submit ourselves. Buddhists believe that man reaps what he has sown; we are the result of what we were, and we will be the result of what we are. In other words, man is not absolutely what he was and he will not absolutely be what he is. This simply means that kamma is not complete determinism: The Buddha pointed out that if everything is determined, then there could be no free will and moral or spiritual life could not be possible. We would merely be the slaves of our past. On the other hand, if everything is undetermined, then there can be no cultivation of moral and spiritual growth. Therefore the Buddha accepted neither strict determinism nor strict indeterminism. These misinterpretations or irrational views on kamma are stated in the Anguttara Nikàya which suggests that the wise will inves- tigate and abandon the following: (1) there are some who believe that everything is a result of acts in previous lives; (2) there are others who believe that all is the result of creation by a Supreme Ruler; (3) there are others again who believe that everything arises without reason or cause.

Yet another misconception of kamma is that it operates only for certain people or for people in certain faiths. But the fate of a man in his next life does not in the least depend on what brand of religion he chooses. Whatever be his religion man’s fate depends entirely on his deeds by body, speech and thoughts. It does not matter what religious label he gives himself, he is sure to be in a happy world in his next life so long as he does good deeds and lives a cultured life without harm- ing others. He is sure to be born to lead a wretched life if he commits evil and harbours wicked thoughts in his mind. Therefore, Buddhists do not preach that they are the only blessed people who can go to heaven after their death. Whatever his faith, man alone determines his own position both in this life and in the next. The teaching of kamma does not indicate a postmortem justice. The Buddha, who had no ulterior, selfi sh motive, did not teach this law of kamma to protect the rich and to comfort the poor by promising illusory happiness in an after life. Buddhists believe that kamma explains the inequalities that exist among mankind. These inequalities are due not only to heredi- tary factors, environment, and nature, but also to kamma or the results of our own actions. Since kamma is an invisible force, we cannot see it working with our physical eyes. To understand how kamma works, we can compare it to seeds: The results of kamma are stored in the sub conscious mind in the same way as the leaves, fl owers, fruits and trunk of a tree are stored in its seed. Under favourable conditions, the fruits of kamma will be produced just as with moisture and light, the leaves and trunk of a tree will sprout from its tiny seed. The working of kamma can also be compared to a bank account: A person who is virtuous, charitable and benevolent in his present life"},{"pageNumber":1260,"pageContent":"1260 is like a person who is adding to his good kamma. But he must replace what he takes or else one day his account will be exhausted and he will be bankrupt. Then whom will he be able to blame for his miser- able state? He can blame neither others nor fate. He alone is responsi- ble. Thus a good Buddhist cannot be an escapist. He has to face life as it is and not run away from it. The kammic force cannot be controlled by inactivity. Vigorous activity for good is indispensable for ones own happiness. Escapism is the resort of the weak; but an escapist cannot escape the effects of the kammic law. To understand the law of kamma is to realise that we ourselves are responsible for our own happiness and our own misery. We are the architects of our kamma. Buddhists believe that man has every possibility to mould his own kamma and thereby infl uence the direc- tion of his life. Man is not a complete prisoner of his own actions; he is not a slave of his kamma. Nor is man a mere machine that automati- cally releases instinctual forces that enslave him. Nor is man a mere product of nature. Man has within himself the strength and the abil- ity to control his kamma. He is mightier than his kamma and so the law of kamma can be made to serve man. Man does not have to give up his hope, effort, and intelligence in order to surrender himself to his kammic force. To offset the reaction of the bad kamma that he has done previously, a man has to do meritorious deeds and to purify his mind rather than by praying, worshipping, or performing religious rites. Man must use the material with which he is endowed to pro- mote his ideal. The cards in the game of life are given to us. We do not select them. They are traced to our past kamma; but we can call as we please, lead what suit we will and, as we play, we can gain and lose. The radical transformations in the characters of Angulimàla and Asoka illustrate man’s potential to gain control over himself. Angulimàla was a highway robber who caused the deaths of"},{"pageNumber":1261,"pageContent":"1261 many men. Can we judge him by his external actions? For within his lifetime, he became an arahat and thus erased all his past misdeeds. Asoka, the Indian emperor, killed thousands and thousands to fi ght his war and to expand his empire. Yet after winning the battle, he completely reformed himself and changed his career to such an extent that today, ‘Amidst the tens of thousands of names of mon- archs that crowd the columns of history, their majesties and royal highnesses and the like, the name of Asoka shines and shines almost alone, as a star.’ Although Buddhists believe that man can eventually con- trol his kammic force, they do not believe that everything is due to kamma. They do not ignore the role played by other forces of nature. According to Buddhism, there are fi ve orders or processes or natural laws ( niyamas ) which operate in the physical and men- tal worlds: (1) the physical laws ( utu niyàma ) relating to seasonal changes etc., (2) the biological laws ( bãja niyàma ) related to order of germs and seeds, (3) the kammic law ( kamma niyàma ) relating to moral causation or the order of act and result, (4) spiritual phenom- ena ( Dhamma niyàma ) relating to electric forces, movement of tides, etc., and (5) psychological laws ( citta niyàma ) which govern the proc- esses of consciousness. Kamma is considered only as one of the fi ve natural laws that account for the diversity in this world. Kamma is often infl uenced by external circumstances: Benefi - cent and malefi cent forces act to counter and to support this self- operating law. These other forces that either aid or hinder kamma are: Birth, time or conditions, beauty, and effort. A favourable birth ( gati sampatti ) or an unfavourable birth ( vipatti ) can develop or hinder the fruition of kamma. For instance, if a person is born to a noble family or in a state of happiness, his for- tunate birth will provide an easy opportunity for his good kamma to operate. An unintelligent person who, by some good kamma, is born"},{"pageNumber":1262,"pageContent":"1262 in a royal family will, on account of his noble parentage, be honoured by the people. If the same person were to have a less fortunate birth, he would not be similarly treated. Beauty ( upadi sampatti ) and ugliness ( upadi vipatti ) are two other factors that hinder or favour the working of kamma. If by some good kamma, a person obtains a good birth, but is born deformed by some bad kamma, then he will not be able to fully enjoy the benefi cial results of his good kamma. Even a legitimate heir to a throne may not perhaps be raised to that high position if he happens to be physically or mentally deformed. Beauty, on the other hand, will be an asset to the possessor. A good looking son of poor parents may attract the attention of others and may be able to distinguish himself through their infl uence. Also, we can fi nd cases of people from poor, obscure family backgrounds who rise into fame and popularity as fi lm actors or actresses or beauty queens. Time and occasion are other factors that infl uence the work- ing of kamma. In the time of famine or during the time of war, all people without exception are forced to suffer the same fate. Here the un favourable conditions open up possibilities for evil kamma to oper- ate. The favourable conditions, on the other hand, will prevent the operation of bad kamma. Effort is perhaps the most important of all the factors that effect the working of kamma. Without effort, both worldly and spiritual progress is impossible. If a person makes no effort to cure himself of a disease or to save himself from his diffi culties or to strive with diligence for his progress, then his evil kamma will fi nd a suitable opportunity to produce its due effects. However, if he endeavours to surmount his diffi culties, his good kamma will come to help him. When shipwrecked in the deep sea, the Bodhisatta Mahà Janaka made an effort to save himself, while the others prayed to the gods and left their fate in the hands of these gods.

She stood in the midst of the crowd for all to see how she had been mistreated. So the Buddha said, “Do no evil, thinking that people will not know about it.

The result of action ( kamma ) is described as vipàka . The following is a brief note on kamma and vipàka : Kamma is action, and vipàka , fruit or result, is its reaction. Just as every object is accompanied by a shadow, even so every volitional activity is inevitably accompanied by its due effect. Like potential seed is kamma. Fruit, arising from the tree, is the vipàka , effect or result. As kamma may be good or bad, so may vipàka , fruit, be good or bad. As kamma is mental, so vipàka too is mental; it is experienced as happiness or bliss, unhappiness or misery, according to the nature of the kamma seed. ânisaüsa are the concomitants advantageous to material conditions, such as prosperity, health and longevity. The other concomitant of vipàka are disadvantageous, and are known as àdãnava (evil consequences). They appear as poverty, ugli- ness, disease, short life span and the like. By kamma is meant the moral and immoral types of mundane consciousness ( kusala akusala lokiya citta ), and by vipàka , the resultant types of mundane consciousness ( lokiya vipàkacitta )."},{"pageNumber":1266,"pageContent":"315.

Commentary In this verse the Buddha’s advice is to guard one’s mind just as rulers would guard a border town. The guarding of the mind comes within the fi eld of mind concentration – bhàvanà – meditation, the central purpose of which is perpetual alertness of mind. The Buddhist theory of meditation aims at the practice of right concentration ( sammà-samàdhi ), the culmination of the noble eightfold path which is expounded for the fi rst time in the Buddha’s inaugu- ral sermon, known as ‘ Dhammacakkappavattana ’, the ‘Turning of the Wheel of the Doctrine.’ The noble eight-fold path as the method of self-enlightenment, which is the goal of Buddhist doctrine, is called majjhimà pañipadà , the middle path. It is so called because it tends to moderation, avoiding the two extremes: On the one hand, of indul- gence in sense pleasures, and on the other, of adherence to the prac- tices of self-mortifi cation. Hence the practice of this method is a median between the two extremes, avoiding all excess. Excess in any direction must be avoided"},{"pageNumber":1269,"pageContent":"1269 as it is dangerous. Buddhist meditation, therefore, cannot be practiced by the worldly man, who is unwilling to reduce his worldly desires, nor is it possible for one who is a fanatic in ascetic practices. In order to observe moderation it is necessary to have strength on the one side, and thoughtfulness on the other. So we fi nd in the formula of the path that right concentration is well supported by the two principles of right effort and right mindfulness. Of these, right effort promotes the ability to rise in one who is prone to sink into sensual pleasure; while right mindfulness becomes a safeguard against falling into extremes of asceticism. Right concentration is not possible without that moral purity which purges one of impure deeds, words and thoughts, and therefore it presupposes right speech, right action and right livelihood. These are the three principles of sãla or moral purity, which is necessarily the preparatory ground to meditation. The training in these principles is the most fundamental aspect of Buddhism and forms the vital factor in contemplative life. Hence, fi rst of all, one must school himself in moral purity in accordance with the rules of the middle path, in order to attain full and immediate results of meditation in an ascending scale of progress. The disciple who conforms himself to these ideals will acquire self-confi dence, inward purity, absence of external fear, and thereby mental serenity, factors which are imperative for ultimate success in meditation."},{"pageNumber":1270,"pageContent":"316.

It appears from the contact of these references that Ajàtasatru, the king of Magadha, met a number of these teachers and asked them each separately to state in clear and unambiguous terms the result of their ascetic practices. All of them were well known in the country as founders of religious schools with a large following. Their names and the special doctrines they held are briefl y stated in the text. It is possible, however, that the information supplied is prejudiced as it emanates from their opponents; in fact, the mis-statements they make are partly due to design and partly to ignorance. All the same, it is interesting to study their views in order to understand correctly as well as to appreciate the views of the founder of Buddhism. Of these six thinkers, Nigaõñha Nàtaputta, who is none other than Mahàvãra, the founder, or according to the Jaina tradition, the last prophet of the present world cycle, seems to have been slightly older than the Buddha. He preached ethical doctrines without apparently knowing that similar ideas had been held by an incom- parably senior ascetic, Pàrsva. The latter is now acknowledged to be Mahàvãra’s predecessor and is believed to have lived two hundred and fi fty years before Mahàvãra. Pàrsva’s ethical code consisted of four rules, whereas that of Mahàvãra consisted of fi ve. Of these, the fi rst three, viz., not to kill living things, not to take articles of use unless they are given, and not to tell a lie, are common to the schools of both Pàrsva and Mahàvãra. The fourth rule in Pàrsva’s teaching, that of aparigraha , not to have any worldly possessions including a wife, was split up into two by Mahàvãra to make up his code of fi ve. Not to take a wife, or to lead a celibate life, which is the fourth rule in Mahàvãra’s code, and not to have worldly possessions except"},{"pageNumber":1275,"pageContent":"1275 clothes, which is the fi fth rule in Mahàvãra’s code, seem to constitute jointly the fourth rule of Pàrsva. The main difference in the practical or external aspects of Pàrsva’s and Mahàvãra’s code of conduct thus seems to have been that while Pàrsva and his followers were acelakàs or naked, Mahàvãra and his followers wore white garments, but refused to have any other paraphernalia. In other words, the Jaina faith as preached by Mahàvãra is the same as Pàrsva’s, but some- what more modern. It was natural therefore that these two schools should have become one as they actually did some two hundred and fi fty years after the death of Pàrsva, when the disciples of Pàrsva and those of Mahàvãra met at Sràvasti and brought about the union. Later, the Jainas explained this fusion of schools differently by add- ing twenty-two prophets to precede Pàrsva, thereby making Pàrsva the twenty-third and Mahàvãra the twenty-fourth of their prophets. It would, however, be quite correct to hold that Pàrsva and Mahàvãra independently evolved a philosophy and a religious system which had identical tenets. In the Sàma¤¤aphala-sutta Niganñha Nàtaputta is mentioned as having held the doctrine of four-fold restraint: restraint from the use of cold water as it contains life, and from sinful activities such as kill- ing and sexual intercourse. He was free from all sins and had purifi ed himself. In the Udumbarika-sãhanàda-sutta the restraints ascribed to him are different, but identical with the four vows of Pàrsva. According to Jaina sources, however Jainism is not a purely ethical system, but also a philosophy based on the doctrine of many possibilities, known as anekànta or syàdvàda . The doctrine looks at two aspects of everything, the eternal and the non-eternal. The soul undergoes migration according to good or bad deeds. As Jainism regards the existence of jãva (life) in everything, it enjoins such behav- iour as does not cause injury to any jãva .

To achieve this one must resort to or acquire right knowledge, faith and conduct. Buddhist sources, for instance the Aïguttara , and the seventy-four sutta of the ekanipàta , ridicule the Jaina doctrine, particularly its idea of overcoming sin, its restraint on movements and its insistence on certain types of clothing. The next important contemporary of the Buddha was Makkhali Gosàla. He belonged to the sect of the acelakàs or naked ones, and, as the fi rst part of his name indicates, carried a staff of bamboo ( maskarin ). It is said that he was, for some time, a disciple of Mahàvãra, but later broke away from him. Afterwards, he probably founded an independent school known as the âjãvika school. Later writers men- tion two predecessors, Nanda Vaccha and Kisa Saükicca, thus giving this school three prophets. This sect is now extinct, but seems to have enjoyed popularity and even royal patronage. The doctrine advocated by Gosàla is styled saüsàra-visuddhi or the doctrine of attaining purity only by passing through all kind of existence. Gosàla did not believe that there was any special cause for either the misery of human beings or for their deliverance. He did not believe in human effort, and held that all creatures were helpless against destiny. He maintained that all creatures, whether wise or foolish, were destined to pass through saüsàra and that their misery would come to an end at the completion of the cycle. No human effort would reduce or lengthen this period. Like a ball of thread, saüsàra had a fi xed term through which every being must pass. The remaining four teachers, who are mentioned as contem- poraries of the Buddha, did not leave their mark on posterity as did Mahàvãra and, to a lesser degree, Gosàla."},{"pageNumber":1277,"pageContent":"318.

The disciples of the Titthãs did not want their children to mix with the children of the followers of the Buddha. They often told their children, “Do not go to the Jetavana Monas- tery, do not pay obeisance to the monks of the Sàkyan clan.” On one occasion, while the Titthã boys were playing with a Buddhist boy near the entrance to the Jetavana Monastery, they felt very thirsty. As the children of the disciples of Titthãs had been told by their parents not to enter a Buddhist monas- tery, they asked the Buddhist boy to go to the monastery and bring some water for them. The young Buddhist boy went to pay obeisance to the Buddha after he had a drink of water, and told the Buddha about his friends who were forbidden by their parents to enter a Buddhist monastery. The Buddha then told the boy to tell the non-Buddhist boys to come and have water at the monastery. When those boys came, the Buddha gave them a discourse to suit their various dispositions. As a result, those boys became established in faith in the Three Gems i.e., the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha.

Some of these systems were led by people who were antagonistic to the Buddha. The incident that gave rise to these verses shows how non-Buddhist parents tried to pre- vent their children from entering Jetavana Monastery. Another note on religious leaders who were the contemporaries of the Buddha. There are frequent references in Buddhist literature to some six senior contemporaries of the Buddha, for instance, in the Dãgha- Nikàya (the Sàma¤¤aphala-Sutta and its counterpart in Sanskrit). It appears from the context of these references that Ajàtasattu, the king of Magadha, met a number of these teachers and asked them each separately to state in clear and unambiguous terms the result of their ascetic practices. All of them were well known in the country as founders of religious schools with a large following. Their names and the special doctrines they held are briefl y stated in the text. It is possible, however, that the information supplied is prejudiced as it emanates from their opponents; in fact, the mis-statements they make are partly due to design and partly to ignorance. All the same, it is interesting to study their views in order to understand correctly as well as to appreciate the views of the founder of Buddhism."},{"pageNumber":1281,"pageContent":"319.

Among them there were six religious teachers who were well known in several kingdoms of North India, and who had considerable followings. These six teachers were, Pårana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosàla, Ajita Kesakambali, Pakudha Kaccàyana, Samjaya Bellaññhiputta and Niganñha Nàthaputta. Besides these six teachers, there were other teachers such as Nanda Vaccha and Kisa Samkicca. Of these six thinkers, Nigaõñha Nàthaputta, who is none other than Mahàvãra, the founder, or according to the Jaina tradition, the last prophet of the present world cycle, seems to have been slightly older than the Buddha. He preached ethical doctrines without apparently knowing that similar ideas had been held by an incom- parably senior ascetic, Pàrsva. The latter is now acknowledged to be Mahàvãra’s predecessor and is believed to have lived two hundred and fi fty years before Mahàvãra. Pàrsva’s ethical code consisted of four rules, whereas that of Mahàvãra consisted of fi ve. Of these, the fi rst three, viz., not to kill living things, not to take articles of use unless they are given, and not to tell a lie, are common to the schools of both Pàrsva and Mahàvãra. The fourth rule in Pàrsva’s teaching, that of aparigraha, not to have any worldly possessions including a wife, was split up into two by Mahàvãra to make up his code of fi ve. Not to take a wife or to lead a celibate life, which is the fourth rule in Mahàvãra’s code, and not to have worldly possessions except clothes, which is the fi fth rule in Mahàvãra’s code, seem to constitute jointly the fourth rule of Pàrsva. The main difference in the practical or external aspects of Pàrsva’s and Mahàvãra’s code of conduct thus seems to have been that while Pàrsva and his followers were acela- kas or naked, Mahàvãra and his followers wore white garments, but refused to have any other paraphernalia. In other words, the Jaina"},{"pageNumber":1283,"pageContent":"1283 faith as preached by Mahàvãra is the same as Pàrsva’s, but somewhat more modern. It was natural therefore that these two schools should have become one as they actually did some two hundred fi fty years after the death of Pàrsva, when the disciples of Pàrsva and those of Mahàvãra met at Sràvasti and brought about the union. Later, the Jainas explained this fusion of schools differently by adding twenty-two prophets to precede Pàrsva, thereby making Pàrsva the twenty-third and Mahàvãra the twenty-fourth of their prophets. It would, however, be quite correct to hold that Pàrsva and Mahàvãra independently evolved a philosophy and a religious system which had identical tenets. In the Sàma¤¤aphala-sutta Nigaõñha Nàthaputta is mentioned as having held the doctrine of four-fold restraint; restraint from the use of cold water as it contains life, and from sinful activities such as kill- ing and sexual intercourse. He was free from all sins and had purifi ed himself. In the Udumbarika-sãhanàda-sutta the restraints ascribed to him are different, but identical with the four vows of Pàrsva. The next important contemporary of the Buddha was Makkhali Gosàla. He belonged to the sect of the Acelakas or Naked Ones, and, as the fi rst part of his name indicates, carried a staff of bamboo (maskarin). It is said that he was for some time a disciple of Mahàvãra, but later broke away from him. Afterwards, he probably founded an independent school known as the âjãvika school. Later writers men- tion two predecessors, Nanda Vaccha and Kisa Samkicca, thus giving this school three prophets. This sect is now extinct, but seems to have enjoyed popularity and even royal patronage. The doctrine advocated by Gosàla is styled saüsàra-visuddhi or the doctrine of attaining purity only by passing through all kinds of existence. Gosàla did not believe that there was any special cause for either the misery of human beings or for their deliverance. He did not believe in human effort, and held that all creatures were helpless against destiny. He maintained that all creatures, whether wise or foolish, were destined to pass through"},{"pageNumber":1284,"pageContent":"1284 saüsàra , and that their misery would come to an end at the completion of the cycle. No human effort would reduce or lengthen this period. Like a ball of thread, saüsàra had a fi xed term, through which every being must pass. Makkhali Gosàla was born in a cattle shed (Gosàla). One day he was following his master with a pot of oil on his head on a muddy ground, and was told (Mà Khali) ‘Do not fall’, but he slipped and fell down. In fear he took to his heels, but the master held him by his cloth. However, leaving the cloth in the hands of the master, he ran away, and in the village enjoyed the same reception as Pårana Kassapa. The remaining four teachers, who are mentioned as contem- poraries of the Buddha, did not leave their mark on posterity as did Mahàvãra and, to a lesser degree, Gosàla. Pårana Kassapa’s clan name was Kassapa, and he was called Pårana (one who completes) as he completed the list of one hundred slaves in a house, with his birth. As he was ill-treated in that house, he escaped from there only to be robbed of his clothes by thieves. As he did not know how to cover himself with anything else, such as grass or reeds, he entered a village without any clothing on. People who saw him thought that he was a sanctifi ed ascetic, who had no attachment to anything and began to offer him food, and look after him. Though he received garments later, he did not want them, as the people honoured him for his non-attachment to clothes. Such was the beginning of his asceticism, and he in due course had a following of fi ve hundred ascetics. Ajitha Kesakambali was so known as he used to wear a gar- ment made of human hair which was cool in the cold season, and warm in the hot season, and which smelt foul and was uncomfortable to the body. Pakudha Kaccàyana always avoided cold water. When he crossed a river or a stream, he considered his precepts violated, and would put up a ståpa of sand to restore his precepts."},{"pageNumber":1285,"pageContent":"1285 Saüjaya Bellaññhiputta was the son of Bellaññha. Niganñha Nàthaputta was the son of Nàtha, and claimed to have no attachment to anything, and never wore any garments. Long before the enlightenment of the Buddha, these six teach- ers had been travelling in various kingdoms and preaching their reli- gious tenets. They had established themselves as recognized religious teachers, and were well known among the people. When they arrived at Sàvatthi, in the course of their wanderings, their followers went and told King Pasenadi of the arrival in their city of these teachers and that they were enlightened. The king said: “You yourselves may invite and bring them to the palace.” The people went and informed them that the King invited them to meals at the palace. However, they showed no interest in accepting the invi- tation. As the people requested them repeatedly to come to the palace, they consented, out of courtesy to their followers, and went to the palace together. The King offered them seats, but they did not sit on expensive seats, and sat on benches and on the fl oor. The King, knowing from their conduct that they could have no substance in their minds, offered them no food, but asked at once whether they were enlightened ones. They knew that if they professed to be enlightened, the King would question them as to their enlightenment, and on their failure to satisfy him he would infl ict bodily injury on them. Therefore, in their own interest, they confessed that they were not enlightened. The King sent them out of the palace. As they were coming out of the palace, their followers asked: “Did the King ask questions, and did he treat you well?” They said: “The King asked us whether we are enlightened, but as the King would be unable to understand what we say as enlightened ones, and would be displeased towards us, out of sheer sympathy for him, we said that we are not enlightened.

Once, the father of Màgaõóiyà, being very much impressed by the personality and looks of the Buddha, had offered his very beautiful daughter in marriage to Gotama Buddha. But the Buddha refused his offer and said that he did not like to touch such a thing which was full of fi lth and excreta, even with his feet. On hearing this remark both Màgaõóiyà’s father and mother, discerning the truth of the remark, attained anàgàmi fruition.

The Buddha was the greatest fi gure in human history, perfect, infallible, blameless and spotless. At the foot of the Bodhi-tree He conquered all evil and attained the highest stage of sanctity. He put an end to all suf- ferings with His attainment of Nibbàna. He was the world honoured one so worthy of homage in all respects. His teaching contains no mys- teries or secrets and is like an open book for all to come and see. (2) sammà-saübuddho : The Buddha was designated as Sammà- Saübuddho because He comprehended the existence of the world in its proper perspective and He discovered the four noble truths through His own comprehension. Born a prince, He renounced the world and strove for six long years seeking enlightenment. During this period, He approached all the renowned teachers of the day and tried all the methods His teachers could teach Him. Having achieved the attain- ment even equivalent to that of His teachers. He still could not fi nd the elusive goal of enlightenment. Finally, through His research and rational understanding and treading a middle path, thus departing from the traditional way of legendary religious beliefs and practices, He found the fi nal solution to the universal problems of unsatisfac- toriness, confl ict and disappointments ( dukkha ). He discovered the law of dependent origination – the law of cause and effect which He assessed as the reality of the world, thereby becoming the supreme Enlightened One. (3) vijjà - carana saüpanno : This term vijjà - carana saüpanno , meant that the Buddha was endowed with perfect clear vision and exem- plary good conduct. It has two signifi cant aspects as indicated in the"},{"pageNumber":1294,"pageContent":"1294 three-fold knowledge and eight-fold wisdom, The three-fold know- ledge is listed as follows: ( a) Firstly, the Buddha could recall His past birth and trace back His previous existences as well as those of others. (b) Secondly, apart from being able to recount the past He had the unique foresight of being able to see into the future and visualise the whole universe at any single moment. (c) Thirdly, He had that deep penetrating knowledge pertaining to arahathood. On the eightfold wisdom, the Buddha was listed as having the unique gift of insight, the power of performing supernormal feats, a divine ear, the power of reading other’s thoughts, various physical powers, ability to recollect past births, a divine eye, and exquisite knowledge pertaining to a life of serene holiness. With regard to the word carana or good conduct, this aspect is divided into fi fteen different categories or types of virtues which were fully imbued in the Buddha. These additional virtues are clas- sifi ed as restraint in deed and word, restraint in the absorption of sense effects, moderation in the consumption of food, avoidance of excessive sleep, maintenance of crystal clear vision in faith, realisa- tion of shame in committing evil, realisation of fear in committing evil, thirst for knowledge, energy, mindfulness and understanding – the four trends pertaining to the material sphere. Pa¤¤ à and karunà are refl ected as wisdom and compassion, both of which are the basic twin virtues of the Buddha. Pa¤¤ à endowed him with wisdom whilst karunà bestowed him with compassion to be of service to mankind. He realised through his wisdom what is good and what is not good for all beings and through His compassion He led His followers away from evil and misery. The great virtues of the Buddha enabled Him to show in His dispensation the highest degree of brotherhood and the sterling qualities to be found in all beings."},{"pageNumber":1295,"pageContent":"1295 (4) sugato : The Buddha was also designated as sugato , which means that His path is good, the destination is excellent and the words and methods used to show the path are harmless and blameless. The Buddha’s path to the attainment of bliss is correct and pure, straight, direct and certain. His words are sublime and infallible. Many well-known histori- ans and great scientists have commented that the only religious teach- ing which has remained unchallenged by science and free-thinkers is the Buddha’s Word. (5) lokavidå : The term lokavidå is applied to the Buddha as the one with exquisite knowledge of the world. The Buddha had experienced, known and penetrated into all aspects of worldly life, physical as well as spiritual. He was the fi rst to make the observation that there were thousands of world systems in the universe. He was the fi rst to declare that the world was nothing but conceptual. In His words, it is regarded as pointless to speculate on the origin and the end of the world or universe. He taught that the origin of the world, its cessation and the path to the cessation thereof is to be found within the fathom long body – the human being with its perceptions and consciousness. (6) anuttaro purisa - damma - sàrathã : Anuttaro means matchless and unsurpassed. Purisa - damma refers to individuals to whom the gift of the Dhamma is to be endowed whereas sàratã means a leader. These three terms taken together imply an incomparable leader capable of bringing wayward men to the path of righteousness. Amongst those who were persuaded to follow the path of the Dhamma and to shun evil were notoriously evil men like Angulimàla, âlawaka and Nàlà- giri; robbers, cannibals and recalcitrants such as Saccaka. All of them were brought into the fold of the Dhamma, and some even attained sainthood within their life-time.

Buddho means that the Buddha, being omniscient, possessed the extraordinary power of being able to convince others of His great dis- covery through His exquisite art of teaching others His Dhamma. His techniques were unsurpassed by any other Buddha. The term Buddho has its secondary meaning translated as awakened, since the ordinary state of man is perpetually in a state of stupor. The Buddha was the fi rst to be awakened and to shake off this state of stupor. Subsequently He convinced others to be awake and to steer clear from the stage of lethargic samsaric sleep or stupor.

Commentary This stanza typifi es the Buddha’s attitude towards his pupils and towards the world at large. He insisted that each person must strive for his own salvation. The Buddha disapproved of those who professed to have secret doctrines, saying: Secrecy is the hallmark of false doctrine. Addressing the Venerable ânanda, his personal attendant, the Buddha said, “I have taught the Dhamma , ânanda, without making any distinction between exoteric and esoteric doctrine, for in respect of the truth, ânanda, the Buddha has no such thing as the closed fi st of a teacher, who hides some essential knowledge from the pupil. He declared the Dhamma freely and equally to all. He kept nothing back, and never wished to extract from his disciples blind and submissive faith in him and his teaching. He insisted on dis- criminative examination and intelligent enquiry. In no uncertain terms did he urge critical investigation when he addressed the inquiring Kàlàmas in a discourse that has been rightly called ‘the fi rst charter of free thought.’” To take anything on trust is not in the spirit of Buddhism, so we fi nd this dialogue between the Buddha and his disciples: — If, now, knowing this and preserving this, would you say: ‘We honour our Master and through respect for him we respect what he teaches?’ — No. Venerable. — That which you affi rm, O’ disciples, is it not only that which you yourselves have recognized, seen and grasped? — Yes, Venerable. And in conformity with this thoroughly correct attitude of true enquiry, it is said, in a Buddhist treatise on logic: ‘As the wise test gold by burning, by cutting it and rubbing it (on a touchstone), so are you to accept my words after examining them and not merely out of regard for me.’ Buddhism is free from compulsion and coercion and does not demand of the follower blind faith. At the very outset the skeptic will be pleased to hear of its call for investigation. Buddhism, from beginning to end, is open to all those who have eyes to see and mind to understand."},{"pageNumber":1300,"pageContent":"324.

Later, his wife died. His sons came to him and looked after him very well; in fact, they were very loving and affectionate to him. In course of time, somehow they coaxed him to give them the remaining four lakhs. Thus, he was left practically penniless. First, he went to stay with his eldest son. After a few days, the daughter-in-law said to him, “Did you give any extra hundred or thousand to your eldest son? Don’t you know the way to the houses of your other sons? Hearing this, the old bràhmin got very angry and he left the eldest son’s house for the house of his second son. The same thing happened in the houses of all his sons. Thus, the old man became helpless; then, taking a staff and a bowl he went to the Buddha for pro- tection and advice. At the monastery, the bràhmin told the Buddha how his sons had treated him and asked for his help. Then the Buddha gave him some verses to memorize and instructed him to recite them wherever there was a large gathering of people.

At this, the sons became frightened and knelt down at the feet of their father and asked for pardon. They also prom- ised that starting from that day they would look after their father properly and would respect, love and honour him. Then, they took their father to their houses; they also warned their wives to look after their father well or else they would be beaten to death. Each of the sons gave a length of cloth and sent every day a food-tray. The bràhmin became healthier than before and soon put on some weight. He realized that he had been showered with these benefi ts on account of the Buddha. So, he went to the Buddha and humbly requested him to accept two food-trays out of the four he was receiving every day from his sons. Then he instructed his sons to send two food-trays to the Buddha. One day, the eldest son invited the Buddha to his house for alms-food. After the meal, the Buddha gave a discourse on the benefi ts to be gained by looking after one’s parents. Then he related to them the story of the elephant called Dhanapàla, who looked after his parents. Dhanapàla when captured pined for the parents who were left in the forest.

One day, King Pasenadi of Kosala went to the monas- tery to pay homage to the Buddha soon after having a heavy meal. The king was in the habit of taking one-quarter basket- ful (half a bushel of) cooked rice and meat curry. While he was in the presence of the Buddha, the king felt so drowsy that he kept on nodding and could hardly keep himself awake. Then he said to the Buddha, “Venerable!

Commentary This stanza was occasioned by the sleepiness displayed by King Pasenadi of Kosala, when he met the Buddha after a heavy meal. King Pasenadi Kosala, the son of King Mahà Kosala, who reigned in the kingdom of Kosala with its capital at Sàvatthi, was another royal patron of the Buddha. He was a contemporary of the Buddha, and owing to his profi ciency in various arts, he had the good fortune to be made king by his father while he was alive. His conversion must probably have taken place during the very early part of the Buddha’s ministry. In the Saüyutta Nikàya it is stated that once he approached the Buddha and questioning Him about His perfect Enlightenment referred to Him as being young in years and young in ordination. The Buddha replied – ‘There are four objects, O mahàràja, that should not be disregarded or despised. They are a khattiya (a warrior prince), a snake, fi re, and a monk. Then He delivered an interesting sermon on this subject to the king. At the close of the sermon the king expressed his great pleasure and instantly became a follower of the Buddha. Since then till his death he was deeply attached to the Buddha. It is said that on one occasion the king prostrated himself before the Buddha and stroked His feet covering them with kisses. His chief queen, Mallikà, a very devout and wise lady, well versed in the Dhamma, was greatly responsible for his religious enthusiasm. Like a true friend, she had to act as his religious guide on several occasions. One day the king dreamt sixteen unusual dreams and was"},{"pageNumber":1307,"pageContent":"1307 greatly perturbed in mind, not knowing their true signifi cance. His bràhmin advisers interpreted them to be dreams portending evil and instructed him to make an elaborate animal sacrifi ce to ward them off. As advised he made all necessary arrangements for this inhuman sacrifi ce which would have resulted in the loss of thousands of help- less creatures. Queen Mallikà, hearing of this barbarous act about to be perpetrated, persuaded the king to get the dreams interpreted by the Buddha whose understanding infi nitely surpassed that of those worldly bràhmins. The king approached the Buddha and mentioned the object of his visit. He related the sixteen dreams and the Buddha explained their signifi cance fully to him. Unlike King Bimbisàra, King Pasenadi had the good fortune to hear several edifying and instructive discourses from the Buddha. In the Saüyutta Nikàya there appears a special section called the Kosala Saüyutta in which is recorded most of the discourses and talks given by the Buddha to the king. Once while the king was seated in the company of the Buddha, he saw some ascetics with hairy bodies and long nails passing by, and rising from his seat respectfully saluted them calling out his name to them: ‘I am the king, your reverences, Pasenadi of the Kosala.’ When they had gone he came back to the Buddha and wished to know whether they were arahats or those who were striving for arahatship. The Buddha explained that it was diffi cult for ordinary laymen enjoy- ing material pleasures to judge whether others are arahats or not and made the following interesting observations: ‘It is by association ( saüvàsena ) that one’s conduct ( sãla ) is to be understood, and that, too, after a long time and not in a short time, by one who is watchful and not by a heedless person, by an intelligent person and not by an unintelligent one. It is by converse ( saüvohàrena ) that one’s purity ( soceyyaü ) is to be understood. It is in time of trouble that one’s fortitude is to be understood. It is by discussion that one’s wisdom is to be understood, and that, too, after a long time and not in a short time, by one who is watchful and not by a heedless person, by an intelligent person and not by an unintelligent one.’"},{"pageNumber":1308,"pageContent":"326.

One day, Sàmanera Sànu was urged by older monks to go up on the dais and recite parts of the Pàli texts. When he had fi nished his recitation he solemnly called out, “May the merits gained by me today for reciting these sacred texts be shared by my mother and my father.” At that time, the devàs and a female evil spirit who had been the mother of the young sàmanera in a previous existence were listening to his recita- tion. When they heard his words, the evil spirit was elated and promptly cried out, “My dear son, how happy I am to share your merit; you have done well, my son. Well done! Well done! ( Sàdhu ! Sàdhu !).” On account of Sàmanera Sànu, the evil spirit came to be very much respected and was given precedence in their assemblies by the devàs and other evil spirits. As the sàmanera grew older, he wanted to return to the life of a lay man; he went home and asked for his clothes from his mother. His mother did not want him to leave the order and tried to dissuade him from leaving it, but he was quite fi rm in his decision. So, his mother promised to give him the clothes after his meal.

Then the evil spirit spoke out, “This sàmanera wants to leave the religious Sangha and return to the life of a lay man; if he does so he will not be able to escape from suffering.” After saying those words, the evil spirit left the body of the boy and he became normal again. Finding his mother in tears and the neighbours crowd- ing around him, he asked what had happened. His mother told him everything that had happened to him and also explained to him that to return to lay life after leaving it was very foolish; in fact, even though living he would be like a dead person. The sàmanera then came to realize his mistake. Taking the three robes from his mother, he went back to the monastery and was soon admitted again as a monk. When told about Sàmanera Sànu, the Buddha wishing to teach him about the restraint of mind said, “My son, one who does not restrain the mind which wanders about cannot fi nd happiness. So, control your mind as a mahout controls an elephant.” At the end of the discourse, Venerable Sànu compre- hended the four noble truths and later attained arahatship.

When King Pasenadi of Kosala was told about it, he sent an elephant trainer to help the elephant get out of the mire. The elephant trainer went to the site where the elephant was.

In this stanza the successful effort made by the mired elephant to pull itself out of the mud was made the occasion to instruct the monks, that they themselves should make an effort to pull themselves out of the mire of moral defi lements. There are other instances of the Buddha utilizing an incident to teach people the truth. The following is one such: A monk was suffering from diarrhoea, and being unable to get up was lying in his own excreta. The Buddha entered his residence in the company of Venerable ânanda, and asked, ‘What is your ailment, monk?” “Venerable, I am suffering from diarrhoea,” replied the monk, “Is there nobody to attend on you” “No, Venerable.” “Why don’t the fellow monks attend on you?” “As I do not attend on other monks, they, too, do not attend on me,” said the monk. The Buddha asked Venerable ânanda to go and bring water. The Buddha poured water on the sick monk, and Venerable ânanda washed him. The Buddha took him by the head, and Venerable ânanda held him by his feet, and they placed him on a bed.

The story occurs in the Ya m a k a Vag ga beginning with the words, ‘The others do not understand.’ For there it is said: It became known all over the Land of the Rose-apple that the Buddha was residing in Protected Forest, attended by a noble elephant. From the city of Sàvatthi, Anàthapiõóika, Visàkhà, the eminent female lay disciple, and other such great personages sent the following message to the Venerable ânanda, “Venerable, obtain for us the privilege of seeing the Buddha.” Likewise fi ve hundred monks residing abroad approached the Venerable ânanda at the conclusion of the rainy season and made the following request, “It is a long time, ânanda, since we have heard a discourse on the Dhamma from the lips of the Buddha. We should like, brother ânanda, if you please, to have the privilege of hearing a dis- course on the Dhamma from the lips of the Buddha.” So Venerable ânanda took those monks with him and went to Protected Forest.

When the elephant Pàrileyyaka saw the Venerable, he took his staff and rushed forward. The Buddha looked around and said to the elephant, “Come back, Pàrileyyaka; do not drive him away. He is a servitor of the Buddha.” The elephant immediately threw away his staff, and requested the privilege of taking the Venerable’s bowl and robe. Venerable ânanda. refused. The elephant thought to himself, “If he is versed in the rules of etiquette, he will refrain from placing his own monastic requisites on the stone slab where the Buddha is accustomed to sit.” Venerable ânanda placed his bowl and robe on the ground. (For those who are versed in the rules of etiquette never place their own monastic requisites on the seat or bed of their spiritual superiors.) After saluting the Buddha, he seated himself on one side. The Buddha asked him, “Did you come alone?” The Venerable informed him that he had come with fi ve hundred monks. “But where are they?” asked the Buddha. “I did not know how you would feel about it, and therefore I left them outside and came in alone.” “Tell them to come in.” The Ven- erable did so. The Buddha exchanged friendly greetings with the monks. Then the monks said to the Buddha, “Venerable, the Exalted One is a delicate Buddha, a delicate prince. You must have endured much hardship, standing and sitting here alone as you have during these three months. For of course you had no one to perform the major and minor duties for you, no one to offer you water for rinsing the mouth or to per- form any of the other duties for you.” The Buddha replied, “Monks, the elephant Pàrileyyaka performed all of these offi ces for me.

That monk was learned, scholarly, versed in the discourses and the discipline, and was well accomplished in knowledge and conduct. He went to his friends and well wishers in the order, and explained to them what took place, and convinced them of his innocence. These monks went to see the monks who pronounced the expulsion order against their friend, and entered into an argument with them, but the matter did not end happily. The monks got divided into two camps, and the matter reached the ears of the Buddha. The Buddha remarked that dissension had arisen in the fraternity of monks, and went up to the monks who pro- nounced the expulsion order. He explained to them the folly of their act as it would lead to dissension among the fraternity of monks. Next, the Buddha went to the followers of the other group, and disapproved of their conduct as that, too, could lead to unexpected dissension among the monks. After the admonition of the Buddha, the monks who pro- nounced the expulsion order continued to conduct their disciplinary rites within the precincts of the monastery, whereas the other faction began to conduct their rites outside the limits of the monastery. When the attention of the Buddha was drawn to this situation, He found nothing wrong with it. However, the matter did not end there. The monks of Kosambi were divided into two camps, and they kept on quarrelling among themselves in the village, in the alms-hall, and wherever they met.

Referring to the forbearance and mildness of the kings them- selves, the Buddha exhorted the monks to sink their differences and be patient since they were already leading the lives of monks. However a spokesman of one faction of the quarrelsome monks said that the Buddha should keep out of their disputes and leave them alone.

Tradition has it that at this time kings oppressed the subjects over whom they ruled. As the Buddha saw men pun- ished and persecuted under the rule of these wicked kings, he was moved to compassion. And he considered thus within himself, “Is it not possible to exercise sovereignty without killing or causing to kill, without conquering or causing to conquer, without sorrow or causing sorrow, with justice and righteousness?” Now Màra the Evil One perceived within himself the thought that was passing through the mind of the Buddha, and thought thus, “The monk Gotama is considering within himself. ‘Is it not possible to exercise sovereignty?’ It must be that he now desires to exercise sovereignty. And this thing which is called sovereignty is an occasion of heedless- ness. If he does exercise sovereignty, I may be able to catch him off his guard. I will therefore go and arouse his ambi- tion.” Accordingly Màra encouraged the Buddha to exercise sovereignty; let the happy one exercise sovereignty, without killing or causing to kill, without conquering or causing to conquer, without sorrow or causing sorrow, with justice and righteousness.

Thus you shall rule justly and righteously.” Then said the Buddha: The whole of a mountain of gold, even of fi ne gold, is not enough for one. Knowing this, a man should walk justly. How can a man who has seen whence arises suffering devote himself to the pleasures of sense? Let the man who has come to know that substratum of being which is called attachment in the world, train himself to subdue this alone. With these Stanzas did the Buddha arouse and alarm Màra the evil one. Then he said to him, “I will admonish you yet again, evil one. I have nothing in common with you.

Commentary In these stanzas the Buddha places an emphasis on Sahàyas (friends and associates) and stresses the need to consider motherhood, father- hood, monkhood and arahathood as blessings. The Buddha reminded young householder Sigàla, who was in the habit of worshipping the six directions, that there is yet another group of six directions he should worship. These six are made of a one’s family members and social and religious persons to whom honour is due. So the story goes this way. A young man named Sigàla used to worship the six cardinal points of the heavens – east, south, west, north, nadir and zenith – in obeying and observing the last advice given him by his dying father. The Buddha told the young man that in the ‘noble discipline’ ( ariyassa vinaye ) of his teaching the six directions were different. According to his ‘noble discipline’ the six directions were:– east: parents; south: teachers; west: wife and children; north: friends, relatives and neigh- bours; nadir: servants, workers and employees; zenith: religious men. “One should worship these six directions” said the Buddha. Here the word worship ( namasseyya ) is very signifi cant, for one wor- ships something sacred, something worthy of honour and respect. These six family and social groups mentioned above are treated in Buddhism as sacred, worthy of respect and worship. But how is one to worship them? The Buddha says that one could worship them only by performing one’s duties towards them. These duties are explained in his discourse to Sigàla."},{"pageNumber":1331,"pageContent":"333.

The Buddha says: “Parents are called bràhma” ( brahmàti màtàpitaro ). The term brahma denotes the highest and most sacred conception in Indian thought, and in it the Buddha includes parents. So in good Buddhist families at the present time children literally worship their parents everyday, morning and evening. They have to perform certain duties towards their parents according to the noble discipline: they should look after their parents in their old age; should do whatever they have to do on their behalf; should maintain the honour of the family and continue the family tradition; should protect the wealth earned by their parents; and perform their funeral rites after their death. Parents, in their turn, have certain responsibilities towards their children: they should keep their children away from evil courses; should engage them in good and profi table activities; should give them a good education; should marry them into good families; and should hand over the property to them in due course. Second: The relation between teacher and pupil should respect and be obedient to his teacher; should attend to his needs of any; should study earnestly. And the teacher, in his turn, should train and shape his pupil properly; should teach him well; should introduce him to his friends; and should try to procure him security or employ- ment when his education is over. Third: The relation between husband and wife: love between husband and wife is considered almost religious or sacred. It is called Sadàra - Brahmacariya ‘sacred family life’. Here, too, the signifi cance of the term Brahma should be noted: the highest respect is given to this relationship. Wives and husbands should be faithful, respectful and devoted to each other, and they have certain duties towards each other: the husband should always honour his wife and never be wanting in respect to her; he should love her and be faithful to her; should secure her position and comfort; and should please her by presenting her with clothing and jewellery.

The wife, in her turn, should supervise and look after household affairs; should entertain guests, visitors, friends, relatives and employees; should love and be faithful to her husband; should protect his earnings; should be clever and energetic in all activities. Fourth: The relation between friends, relatives and neighbours: they should be hospitable and charitable to one another; should speak pleasantly and agreeably; should work for each other’s welfare; should be on equal terms with one another; should not quarrel among them- selves; should help each other in need; and should not forsake each other in diffi culty. Fifth: The relation between master and servant: the master or the employer has several obligations towards his servant or his Employee: work should be assigned according to ability and capacity; adequate wages should be paid; medical needs should be provided; occasional donations or bonuses should be granted. The servant or employee, in his turn, should be diligent and not lazy; honest and obedient and not cheat his master; he should be earnest in his work. Sixth: The relation between the religious (lit. recluses and bràh- manas) and the laity: lay people should look after the material needs of the religious with love and respect; the religious with a loving heart should impart knowledge and learning to the laity, and lead them along the good path away from evil. Matteyyatà : This means attention and good conduct towards moth- ers – towards womankind. The Buddha has a unique place in world’s religions, as a spiritual leader who was keenly concerned with pro- viding privileges to women. Women’s position in Buddhism is unique. The Buddha gave women full freedom to participate in a religious life. The Buddha was the fi rst religious teacher who had given this religious freedom to women. Before the Buddha, women’s duty had been restricted to the kitchen; women were not even allowed to enter any temple or to recite"},{"pageNumber":1334,"pageContent":"1334 anything religious. During the Buddha’s time, women’s position in society was very low. The Buddha was criticized very strongly by the prevailing establishment when he gave this freedom to women. His move to allow women to enter the holy order was extremely radical for the times. Yet the Buddha allowed women to prove themselves and to show that they too had the capacity like men to attain the high- est position is the religious way of living by attaining Arahanthood. Every woman in the world must be grateful to the Buddha for show- ing them the real religious way of living and for giving such freedom to them for the fi rst time in world history. A good illustration of the prevailing attitude towards women during the Buddha’s time is found in these words of Màra: “No woman, with the two-fi nger wisdom which is hers, could ever hope to reach those heights which are attained only by the sages.” Undoubtedly the Buddha was vehement in contradicting such attitudes. The nun to whom Màra addressed these words, gave the following reply: “When one’s mind is well concentrated and wisdom never fails, does the fact of being a woman make any difference?” King Kosala was very much disappointed when he heard that his Queen had given birth to a baby girl. He had expected a boy. To console the sad King, the Buddha said: “A female child, O Lord of men, may prove Even a better offspring than a male. For she may grow up wise and virtuous. Her husband’s mother reverencing, true wife. The boy that she may bear may do great deeds. And rule great realms, yes, such a son. Of noble wife becomes his country’s guide.” On one such occasion, he admitted that man is not always the only wise one; woman is also wise."},{"pageNumber":1335,"pageContent":"Chapter 24 Taõhà Vagga Craving"},{"pageNumber":1336,"pageContent":"334.

The Bandits & The Story of the Present: The Fishermen, and The Fish with Stinking Breath (Verses 334 – 337) The story goes that in times long past, when Buddha Kassapa passed into Nibbàna, two brothers of a respectable family retired from the world and became monks under their disci- ples. The name of the older brother was Sodhana, and that of the younger was Red Kapila. Likewise their mother Sàdhinã and their younger sister Tàpanà retired from the world and became nuns. After the t wo brothers had become monks, they performed regularly and faithfully the major and minor duties to their teachers and their preceptors. One day they asked the following question, “Venerable, how many burdens are there in this religion?” and received the following answer, “There are two burdens: the burden of study and the burden of meditation.” Thereupon the older brother said, “I will fulfi l the burden of meditation,” and for fi ve years stayed with his teacher and his preceptor. Obtaining a meditation topic lead- ing to arahatship, he entered the forest, and after striving and struggling with might and main, attained arahatship. Said the younger brother, “I am young yet; when I am old, I will fulfi l the burden of meditation.” Accordingly he assumed the burden of study and learned by heart the three Pitakas . By his knowledge of the texts, he gained a great fol- lowing, and through his following, rich offerings. Drunk with the intoxication of great learning, and overcome with craving"},{"pageNumber":1338,"pageContent":"1338 for gain, he was led by overweening pride of knowledge to pronounce a thing said by others, even when it was right, to be wrong; even when wrong, to be right; even when it was innocent, to be sinful; even when sinful, to be innocent. The kindly monks used to say to him, “Brother Kapila, do not speak thus:” and would admonish him, quoting to him the doctrine and the discipline. But Kapila would reply, “What do you know, empty-fi sts?” and would go about snubbing and disparaging others. The monks reported the matter to his brother, Venerable Sodhana. Sodhana went to him and said, “Brother Kapila, for men such as you, right conduct is the life of religion; therefore you should not abandon right conduct, reject that which is right and proper and speak as you do.” Thus did Sodhana admonish his brother Kapila. But the latter paid no attention to what he said. However, Sodhana admonished him two or three times, but seeing that he paid no attention to his words, left him, saying, “Well, brother, you will become notorious for your doings.” And from that time on, the rest of the kindly monks would have nothing to do with him. Thus did the monk Kapila adopt an evil mode of con- duct and go about with companions confi rmed like himself in an evil mode of conduct. One day he said to himself, “I will recite the Pàtimokkha in the hall of discipline.” So taking a fan and seating himself in the seat of the Dhamma, he recited the Pàtimokkha, asking the usual question, “Brethren, are there, among the monks who are here gathered together, any who have anything to confess?” The monks thought, “What is the use of giving this fellow an answer?” Observing that the monks all remained silent, he said, “Brethren, there is no doctrine or discipline; what difference does it make whether"},{"pageNumber":1339,"pageContent":"1339 you hear the Pàtimokkha or not?” So saying, he arose from the seat. Thus did he retard the teaching of the word of Buddha Kassapa. Venerable Sodhana attained Nibbàna in that very state of existence. As for Kapila, at the end of his allotted term of life, he was reborn in the great hell of avãci . Kapila’s mother and sister followed his example, reviled and abused the kindly monks, and were reborn in that same Hell. Now at that time there were fi ve hundred men who made a living by plundering villages. One day the men of the coun- tryside pursued them, whereupon they fl ed and entered the forest. Seeing no refuge there, and meeting a certain forest her- mit, they saluted him and said to him, “Venerable, be our ref- uge.” The Venerable replied, “For you there is no refuge like the precepts of morality. Do you take upon yourselves, all of you, the fi ve precepts.” “Very well,” agreed the bandits, and took upon themselves the fi ve precepts. Then the Venerable admon- ished them, saying, “Now that you have taken upon yourselves the Precepts, not even for the sake of saving your lives, may you transgress the moral law, or entertain evil thoughts.” “Very well,” said the former bandits, giving their promise. When the men of the countryside reached that place, they searched everywhere, and discovering the bandits, deprived all those bandits of life. So the bandits died and were reborn in the world of the gods; the leader of the bandits became the leading deity of the group. After passing through the round of existences forward and backward in the world of the gods for the period of an interval between two Buddhas, they were reborn in the dispensation of the present Buddha in a village of fi shermen consisting of fi ve hundred house- holds near the gate of the city of Sàvatthi."},{"pageNumber":1340,"pageContent":"335.

The leader of the fi shermen thought to himself, “Were not some other boys born in this village today?” Causing a search to be made, he learned that the companions had been reborn in the same place. “These will be the companions of my son,” thought he, and sent food to them all for their sustenance. They all became playfellows and friends, and in the course of time grew to manhood. The oldest of the fi shermen’s sons won fame and glory and became the leading man of the group. Kapila was tormented in hell during the period of an interval between two Buddhas, and through the fruit of his evil deeds which still remained, was reborn at this time in the Aciravatã River as a fi sh. His skin was of a golden hue, but he had stinking breath. Now one day those companions said to themselves, “Let us snare some fi sh.” So taking a net, they threw it into the river. It so happened that this fi sh fell into their net. When the resi- dents of the village of fi shermen saw the fi sh, they made merry and said, “The fi rst time our sons snared fi sh, they caught a goldfi sh; now the king will give us abundant wealth.” The companions tossed the fi sh into a boat and went to the king. When the king saw the fi sh, he asked, “What is that?” “A fi sh, your majesty,” replied the companions. When the king saw it was a goldfi sh, he thought to himself, “The Buddha will know the reason why this fi sh has a golden hue.” So ordering the fi sh to be carried for him, he went to the Buddha.

But he was overcome with desire of gain, and would abuse and revile those who would not take him at his word. Thus did he retard the religion of Buddha Kassapa, was therefore reborn in the avãci hell, and because the fruit of his evil deed has not yet been exhausted, has just been reborn as a fi sh. Now since for a long time he preached the word of the Buddha and recited the praises of the Buddha, for this cause he has received a golden hue. But because he reviled and abused the monks, for this cause he has come to have stinking breath. I will let him speak for himself, great king.” “Venerable, by all means let him speak for himself.” So the Buddha asked the fi sh, “Are you Kapila?” “Yes, Venerable, I am Kapila.” “Where have you come from?” “From the Great Hell of Avãci, Venerable.” “What became of your older brother Sodhana?” “He passed into Nibbàna, Venerable.” “But what became of your mother Sàdhinã?” “She was reborn in Hell, Venerable.” “And what became of your younger sister Tàpanà?” “She was reborn in hell, Venerable.” “Where shall you go now?” “Into the great hell of avãci , Venerable.” So saying, the fi sh, overcome with remorse, struck his head against the boat, died then and there, and was reborn in hell.

Ten saüyojanas , or defi lements, are: (1) holding to the opinion of enduring substantiality ( sakkàyadiññhi ), (2) (skeptical) doubt ( vicikicchà ) , (3) clinging to precept and practices ( sãlabbataparàmàsa ), (4) passion for sensual desires, ( kàmaràga ), (5) ill-will ( vyàpàda ), (6) passion for the fi ne-material (realm) ( råparàga ), (7) passion for the formless (realm) ( aråparàga ), (8) self-estimation ( màna ), (9) agitation ( uddhaccaü ), and (10) ignorance ( avijjà ). They are of two modes: (i) pertaining to the upper part and (ii) per- taining to the lower part. They are called fetters because they bind beings in saüsàra in the sense that they cause rebirth there again and again. The fi ve, beginning with holding to the opinion of enduring substantiality, and so on, are called those pertaining to the lower part, because they are the cause for birth in the eleven realms of sensuality that are called lower (realms), and fi ve, beginning with passion for the fi ne-material (realm), and so on, are called those pertaining to the upper part because they are the cause for birth in the fi ne-material realm and the formless realm, which are called upper.

Rebirth : This story is replete with several layers of rebirth. Some of the rebirths referred to took place even after the days of the Buddha. In some instances the rebirths take place in Sri Lanka. The concepts of the origin of life and of rebirth have been interpreted in various ways by scholars. Here is one point of view: Rebirth, which Buddhists do not regard as a mere theory but as a fact verifi able by evidence, forms a fundamental tenet of Buddhism, though its goal, Nibbàna, is attainable in this life itself. The Bodhisatta Ideal and the correlative doctrine of freedom to attain utter perfection are based on this doctrine of rebirth. Documents record that this belief in rebirth is viewed as trans- migration or reincarnation, in many great poems by Shelley, Tennyson and Wordsworth, and writings of many ordinary people in the East as well as in the West. The Buddhist doctrine of rebirth should be differentiated from the theory of transmigration and reincarnation of other systems, because Buddhism denies the existence of a transmigrating perma- nent soul, created by a god, or emanating from a paramàtma (divine essence). It is kamma that conditions rebirth. Past kamma conditions the present birth; and present kamma, in combination with past kamma, conditions the future. The present is the offspring of the past, and becomes, in turn, the parent of the future. The reality of the present needs no proof as it is self-evident. That of the past is based on memory and report, and that of the future on forethought and inference. If we postulate a past, a present and a future life, then we are at once faced with the problem – What is the ultimate origin of life? One school, in attempting to solve the problem, postulates a fi rst cause, whether as a cosmic force or as an almighty being. Another"},{"pageNumber":1365,"pageContent":"1365 school denies a fi rst cause, for in common experience, the cause ever becomes the effect and the effect becomes the cause. In a circle of cause and effect a fi rst cause is inconceivable. According to the former, life has had a beginning; according to the latter, it is beginningless. In the opinion of some the conception of a fi rst cause is like saying a triangle is round. One might argue that life must have had a beginning in the infi nite past and that beginning is the fi rst cause, the creator. In that case there is no reason why some may not make the same demand about a postulated creator. With respect to this alleged fi rst cause men have held widely different views. In interpreting this fi rst cause, many names have been used. Hindu traces the origin of life to a mystical paramàtma from which emanate all àtmàs or souls that transmigrate from existence to existence until they are fi nally reabsorbed in Paramàtma. One might question whether these reabsorbed àtmàs have further transmigration. “Whoever,” as Schopenhaeur says, “regards himself as having come out of nothing must also think that he will again become noth- ing; for that an eternity has passed before he was, and then a second eternity had begun, through which he will never cease to be, is a monstrous thought. “Moreover, i f bi rt h is t he absolute beg i n n i ng, t hen deat h must be the absolute end; and the assumption that man is made out of nothing, leads necessarily to the assumption that death is his absolute end.” “According to the theological principles,” argues Spencer Lewis, “man is created arbitrarily and without his desire, and at the moment of creation is either blessed or unfortunate, noble or depraved, from the fi rst step in the process of his physical creation to the moment of his last breath, regardless of his individual desires, hopes, ambi- tions, struggles or devoted prayers. Such is theological fatalism. In “Despair”, a poem of his old age, Lord Tennyson, referring to theist theology, said:"},{"pageNumber":1366,"pageContent":"1366 “I make peace and create evil. What I should call on that infi nite love that has served us so well? Infi nite cruelty rather that made everlasting hell. Made us, foreknew us, foredoomed us, and does what he will with his own. Better our dead brute mother who never has heard us groan.” “The doctrine that all men are sinners and have the essential sin of Adam is a challenge to justice, mercy, love and omnipotent fairness”. Huxley said: “If we are to assume that anybody has designedly set this wonderful universe going, it is perfectly clear to me that he is no more entirely benevolent and just, in any intelligible sense of the words, than that he is malevolent and unjust”. According to Einstein: “If this being is omnipotent, then every occurrence, including every human action, every human thought, and every human feeling and aspiration is also his work; how is it pos- sible to think of holding men responsible for their deeds and thoughts before such an almighty being? In giving out punishments and rewards, He would to a certain extent be passing judgment on himself. How can this be combined with the goodness and righteousness ascribed to him?” According to Charles Bradlaugh: “The existence of evil is a terrible stumbling block to the theist. Pain, misery, crime, poverty confront the advocate of eternal goodness, and challenge with un answerable potency his declaration of Deity as all-good, all-wise, and all-powerful.” Commenting on human suffering and creator, Prof. J.B.S. Haldane writes: “Either suffering is needed to perfect human character, or God is not Almighty. The former theory is disproved by the fact that some people who have suffered very little but have been fortunate in their ancestry and education have very fi ne characters. The objection to the second is that it is only in connection with the universe as a whole"},{"pageNumber":1367,"pageContent":"1367 that there is any intellectual gap to be fi lled by the postulation of a deity. And a creator could presumably create whatever he or it wanted.” Dogmatic writers of old authoritatively declared that the crea- tor created man after his own image. Some modern thinkers state, on the contrary, that man created his creator after his own image. With the growth of civilization man’s conception of God grows more and more refi ned. There is at present a tendency to substitute this personal creator by an impersonal god. Voltaire states that the conception of a creator is the noblest creation of man. It is however impossible to conceive of such an omnipotent, omnipresent being, an epitome of everything that is good – either in or outside the universe. Modern science endeavours to tackle the problem with its lim- ited systematized knowledge. According to the scientifi c standpoint, we are the direct products of the sperm and ovum cells provided by our parents. But science does not give a satisfactory explanation with regard to the development of the mind, which is infi nitely more important than the machinery of man’s material body. Scientists, while asserting “ Omne vivum ex vivo ” “all life from life” maintain that mind and life evolved from the lifeless. Now from the scientifi c standpoint we are absolutely parent- born. Thus our lives are necessarily preceded by those of our parents and so on. In this way life is preceded by life until one goes back to the fi rst protoplasm or colloid. As regards the origin of this fi rst pro- toplasm or colloid, however, scientists plead ignorance. What is the attitude of Buddhism with regard to the origin of life? At the outset it should be stated that the Buddha does not attempt to solve all the ethical and philosophical problems that perplex man- kind. Nor does He deal with speculations and theories that tend nei- ther to edifi cation nor to enlightenment. Nor does He demand blind faith from His adherents. He is chiefl y concerned with one practical and specifi c problem – that of suffering and its destruction; all side issues are completely ignored."},{"pageNumber":1368,"pageContent":"1368 “It is as if a person were pierced by an arrow thickly smeared with poison, and his friends and relatives were to procure a surgeon, and then he were to say. ‘I will not lead the holy life under the Buddha until He elucidated to me whether the world is eternal or not eternal, whether the world is fi nite or infi nite...’ That person would die before these questions had ever been elucidated by the Buddha. “If it be the belief that the world is eternal, will there be the observance of the holy life? In such a case – No! If it be the belief that the world is not eternal, will there be the observance of the holy life? In that case also – No! But, whether the belief be that the world is eter- nal or that it is not eternal, there is birth, there is old age, there is death, the extinction of which in this life itself I make known.” “Màlunkyaputta, I have not revealed whether the world is eter- nal or not eternal, whether the world is fi nite or infi nite. Why have I not revealed these? Because these are not profi table, do not concern the bases of holiness, are not conducive to aversion, to passionlessness, to cessation, to tranquility, to intuitive wisdom, to enlightenment or to Nibbàna. Therefore I have not revealed these.” According to Buddhism, we are born from the matrix of action ( kammayoni ). Parents merely provide us with a material layer. Therefore being precedes being. At the moment of conception, it is kamma that conditions the initial con- sciousness that vitalizes the fœtus. It is this invisible kammic energy, generated from the past birth, that produces mental phenomena and the phenomena of life in an already extant physical phenomena, to complete the trio that constitutes man. Dealing with the conception of beings, the Buddha states: “Where three are found in combination, there a germ of life is planted. If mother and father come together, but it is not the mother’s fertile period, and the being-to-be-born ( gandhabba ) is not present, then no germ of life is planted. if mother and father come together, and it is the mother’s fertile period, but the being-to-be-born is not present then again no germ of life is planted. If mother and father come together and it is the mother’s fertile period, and the being-to-be-born is present,"},{"pageNumber":1369,"pageContent":"1369 then by the conjunction of these three, a germ of life is there planted.” Here gandhabba ( =gantabba ) does not mean ‘a class of devas, said to preside over the process of conception’, but refers to a suitable being ready to be born in that particular womb. This term is used only in this particular connection, and must not be mistaken for a permanent soul. For a being to be born here, somewhere this being must die. The birth of a being, which strictly means the arising of the aggregates ( khandhànaü pàtubhàvo ), or psycho-physical phenomena in this present life, corresponds to the death of a being in a past life; just as, in conventional terms, the rising of the sun in one place means the setting of the same sun in another place. This enigmatic statement may be better understood by imagining life as a wave and not as a straight line. Birth and death are only two phases of the same process. Birth precedes death, and death, on the other hand, precedes birth. This constant succession of birth and death in connection with each individual life-fl ux constitutes what is technically known as saüsàra – recurrent wandering. What is the ultimate origin of life? The Buddha positively declares: Without cognizable beginnings this saüsàra , the earliest point of beings who, obstructed by ignorance and fettered by craving, wander and fare on, is not to be perceived. This life-stream fl ows ad infi nitum , as long as it is fed with the muddy waters of ignorance and craving. When these two are completely cut off, then only does the life-stream cease to fl ow, rebirth ends, as in the case of Buddhas and arahats. A fi rst beginning of this life-stream cannot be determined, as a stage cannot be perceived when this life force was not fraught with ignorance and craving. It should be understood that the Buddha has here referred merely to the beginning of the life-stream of living beings. Rebirth : But the four mental aggregates, viz, consciousness and the three other groups of mental factors forming nàma or the unit of con- sciousness, go on uninterruptedly arising and disappearing as before, but not in the same setting, because that setting is no more. They have"},{"pageNumber":1370,"pageContent":"1370 to fi nd immediately a fresh physical base as it were, with which to function – a fresh material layer appropriate and suitable for all the aggregates to function in harmony. The kammic law of affi nity does this work, and immediately a resetting of the aggregates takes place and we call this rebirth. But it must be understood that in accordance with Buddhist belief, there is no transmigration of a soul or any substance from one body to another. According to Buddhist philosophy what really happens, is that the last javana or active thought process of the dying man releases cer- tain forces which vary in accordance with the purity of the fi ve javana thought moments in that series. (Five, instead of the normal seven javana thought-moments). These forces are called kamma vega or kammic energy which attracts itself to a material layer produced by parents in the mother’s womb. The material aggregates in this germinal compound must possess such characteristics as are suitable for the reception of that particular type of kammic energy. Attraction in this manner of various types of physical aggregated produced by parents occurs through the operation of death and gives a favourable rebirth to the dying man. An unwholesome thought gives an unfavourable rebirth. In brief, the combination of the fi ve aggregates is called birth. Existence of these aggregates as a bundle is called life. Dissolution of these things is called death. And recombination of these aggre- gates is called rebirth. However, it is not easy for an ordinary man to understand how these so-called aggregates recombine. Proper under- standing of the nature of elements, mental and kammic energies and cooperation of cosmic energies is important in this respect. To some, this simple and natural occurrence – death, means the mingling of the fi ve elements with the same fi ve elements and thereafter nothing remains. To some, it means transmigration of the soul from one body to another; and to others, it means indefi nite suspension of the soul; in other words, waiting for the day of judgment. To Buddhists, death is nothing but the temporary end of this temporary phenomenon. It is not the complete annihilation of this so-called being."},{"pageNumber":1371,"pageContent":"344.

As a pupil of the Venerable Mahàkassapa, this monk had achieved the four mental absorptions ( jhànas ). But one day, as he went for alms-food to his uncle’s house, he saw a woman and felt a great desire to have her. Then he left the Sangha. As a layman, he was a failure as he did not work hard. So, his uncle drove him out of the house, and sub- sequently he became mixed up with some thieves. All of them were caught by the authorities and were taken to the cemetery to be executed. The Venerable Mahàkassapa saw his pupil as he was being led out and said to him, “My pupil, keep your mind steadfastly on a subject of meditation.” As instructed, he concentrated and let himself be established in deep mental absorption. At the cemetery, while the executioners were making preparations to kill him, the ex-monk was very much composed and showed no signs of fear or anxiety. The execu- tioners and the onlookers were awe-struck and very much impressed by the man’s courage and composure and they reported about him to the king and also to the Buddha. The king gave orders to release the man. The Buddha on hearing about the matter sent his radiance and appeared to the thief as if in person whereupon He gave the stanza.

The king ordered them to be bound with fetters, ropes, and chains. Now thirty country monks, desiring to see the Buddha, came and saw the Buddha, saluted him and took their leave. On the following day, as they went about Sàvatthi for alms, they came to the prison-house and saw those criminals. Returning from their alms-round, they approached the Buddha at eventide and said to him, “Venerable, today, as we were mak- ing our alms-rounds, we saw many criminals in the prison- house. They were bound with fetters, ropes, and chains, and were experiencing much suffering. They cannot break these fet- ters and escape. Is there any bond stronger than these bonds?” In reply to their question, the Buddha said, “Monks, what do these bonds amount to? Consider the bond of the evil pas- sions, the bond which is called craving, the bond of attachment for wealth, crops, sons, and wives. This is a bond a hundredfold, nay, a thousandfold stronger than these bonds which you have seen. But strong as it is, and hard to break, wise men of old broke it, and going to the Himàlaya country, retired from the world.” So saying, he related the following: 4a.

His mother, in spite of his protests, brought him a certain daughter of respectable family to wife. After a time his mother died. In the course of time his wife conceived a child in her womb. Not knowing that she had conceived a child, the husband said to the wife, “Dear wife, make your living by working for hire; I intend to become a monk.” Thereupon the wife said to the husband, “I have conceived a child in my womb. Wait until I give birth to the child and you see him, and then become a monk.” “Very well,” said the husband, promising to do so. When the wife had given birth to her child, the husband took leave of her, saying, “Dear wife, you have given birth to your child in safety; now I shall become a monk.” But the wife replied, “Just wait until your son has been weaned from the breast.” While the husband waited, the wife conceived a second child. The husband thought to himself, “If I do as she wishes me to, I shall never get away; I will run away and become a monk without so much as saying a word to her about it.” So without saying so much as a word to his wife about his plans, he rose up in the night and fl ed away. The city guards caught him. But he persuaded them to release him, saying to them, “Masters, I have a mother to support; release me.” After tarrying in a certain place he went to the Himàlaya country and adopted the life of an anchorite. Having developed the supernatural faculties and the higher attainments, he dwelt there, diverting himself with the diversion of the trances.

Special emphasis was laid on the two terms antà which means end or extreme and pabbajita which means one who has renounced the world. One extreme, in the Buddha’s own words, was the constant attach- ment to sensual pleasures ( kàmasukhallikànuyoga ). The Buddha described this extreme as base, vulgar, worldly, ignoble, and profi tless. This should not be misunderstood to mean that the Buddha expects all His followers to give up material pleasures and retire to a forest without enjoying this life. The Buddha was not so narrow- minded. Whatever the deluded sensualist may feel about it, to the dispas- sionate thinker the enjoyment of sensual pleasure is distinctly short- lived, never completely satisfying, and results in unpleasant reactions. Speaking of worldly happiness, the Buddha says that the acquisition of wealth and the enjoyment of possessions are the source of pleasure for a layman. An understanding recluse would not however seek delight in the pursuit of these fl eeting pleasures. To the surprise of the average man he might shun them. What constitutes pleasure to the former is a source of alarm to the latter to whom renunciation alone is pleasure."},{"pageNumber":1380,"pageContent":"347.

But she had heard that the Buddha always talked dis- paragingly about beauty and she therefore tried to avoid see- ing the Buddha. The king understood her attitude towards the Buddha; he also knew how proud she was of her beauty. So the king ordered his minstrels to sing in praise of the Veluvana monastery, about its pleasant and peaceful atmosphere, etc. Hearing them, Queen Khemà became interested and decided to set out for the Veluvana Monastery. When Queen Khemà arrived at the monastery, the Buddha was expounding the Dhamma to an audience. By his supernormal power, the Buddha made a very beautiful young lady appear, sitting not far from him, and fanning him. When Queen Khemà came to the audience hall, she alone saw the beautiful young lady. Comparing the exquisite beauty of the young lady to that of her own, Khemà realized that her beauty was much inferior to that of the young lady. As she looked again at the young lady her beauty began to fade gradually. In the end, she saw before her eyes an old decrepit being, which again changed into a corpse, her stinking body being attacked by maggots.

Once, a wandering theatrical troupe consisting of fi ve hundred dancers and some acrobats, came to Ràjagaha and performed in the grounds of the palace of King Bimbisàra for seven days. There, a young dancer who was the daughter of an acrobat, sang and danced on top of a long bamboo pole. Uggasena, the young son of a rich man, fell desperately in love with this dancer and his parents could not stop him from marrying her. He married the young dancer and followed the troupe. As he was not a dancer nor an acrobat, he was not of much use to the party. So, as the party moved from place to place, he had to carry boxes, to drive the carts, etc. In course of time, a son was born to Uggasãna and his wife, the dancer. To this child, the dancer would often sing a song which ran thus “O you, son of the man who keeps watch over the carts; the man who carries boxes and bundles! O you, son of the ignorant one who can do nothing!” Uggasena heard the song; he knew that his wife was referring to him and he was very much hurt and depressed. So he went to his father- in-law, the acrobat, and requested him to teach him acrobatics. After a year’s training, Uggasena became a skilful acrobat.

So he entered Ràjagaha and willed that the audience should turn their attention to him instead of applauding Uggasena for his acrobatic feats. When Uggasena saw that he was being neglected and ignored, he just sat on top of the pole, feeling very discontented and depressed.

There a young woman saw him, and no sooner saw him than fell in love with him. “Venerable,” said she, “should you again require water, pray come right here; go nowhere else.” After that, whenever he failed to obtain drinking water, he went to her house and never went anywhere else. And she would take his bowl and give him water for drinking. As time went on, she gave him rice-gruel also. Again one day she pro- vided a seat for him right there and gave him boiled rice. And seating herself near him, she started up a conversation, say- ing, “Venerable, it is very lonely indeed in this house; we never see so much as a traveler.” After listening to her talk for a few days, the young monk became discontented.

For in a previous state of existence, she had for- saken Dhanuggaha, the wisest man in all India, and conceiv- ing a passion for a certain bandit on the spur of the moment, slew her husband.” The monks asked the Buddha to make the matter clear, and in compliance with their request, he related the following: 7a. Story of the Past: Young Archer the Wise In times past there lived a certain wise man named Young Archer the Wise, Culla Dhanuggaha. He acquired the arts and crafts at Takkasilà under a world-renowned teacher. His teacher was so pleased with the progress he made that he gave him his daughter in marriage. Young Archer the Wise took his wife and set out for Benàres. At the entrance to the forest he slew fi fty bandits with fi fty arrows. When his arrows were all gone, he seized the leader of the bandits and hurled him to the ground. “Wife, bring me my sword!” cried he. But the moment his wife saw that bandit, she conceived a passion for him, and placed the hilt of the sword in the hand of the bandit. The bandit straightway slew Young Archer the Wise.

When the woman discovered that the bandit had left her, she said, “Bràhmin, you have taken all my ornaments and crossed to the other side. Return speedily, quickly; now take me too to the other side.” The bandit replied, “Woman, you have bartered a hus- band whom you have long known for me, a husband whom you know not; you have bartered a husband tried and true for a husband whom you have not tried. Woman, you may barter me for another man. Therefore I will go far from hence.” [In order to put the woman to shame, Sakka goes to the river accompanied by his charioteer and his musician. Sàkka takes the form of a jackal, the charioteer that of a fi sh, and the musician that of a bird. The jackal takes a piece of meat in his mouth and stands in front of the woman. The fi sh leaps out of the water, and the jackal springs forward to catch the fi sh, dropping the piece of meat. The bird seizes the piece of meat and fl ies up into the air. The fi sh disappears in the water. Thus the jackal loses both fi sh and fl esh. The woman laughs loudly. [The jackal says:] Who is this that laughs loud in the cassia thicket?

When the Buddha had related at length this Culla Dhanug- gaha Jàtaka, found in the fi fth Nipàta, he said, “At that time you were Young Archer the Wise, the woman was this maiden here, and the king of the gods who came in the form of a jackal and put her to shame, was I myself.

When Gotama Buddha, with the fi ne array of Mahà arahats, visited the home town of Kapilavatthu for the fi rst time, Yasodharà, the mother of Ràhula, who was only seven years old, pointing out the Buddha to him, repeated a set of nine verses ( Narasãha gàthà ) so called as they gave a description of the king of men from foot to head while the last verse gave a graphic picture of Buddha among His disciples like the resplend- ent moon in the starry universe. Each Buddhist child had to learn these verses by memory. Yasodharà was also known as Bimbà Devi, so called due to her rosy complexion. After her ordination, she was known a Bhadda Kaccànà. The mother requested the child to ask for his inheritance from his father. The moment they met the young Ràhula was drawn towards the Buddha exclaiming, “Oh, how sweet is thy shade!” Ràhula, who was clamouring for his inheritance, followed the Buddha all the way to the temple while the Buddha remained silent.

This led to an interesting sequel. King Suddhodana was grief stricken to learn that his grandson had been ordained. He hastened towards Buddha and laid bare his sorrow.

Every morning it was a cus- tom of his to throw up a handful of sand and wish that he would get as ample admonition as those grains of sand. The Buddha preached to him that he should not tell a lie even for fun. The sermon is called Ambalatthika Ràhulovàda Sutta . The Buddha compared a liar to an empty vessel. Once on begging rounds, Ràhula, who was then eighteen years old, was with the Buddha and was soon comparing himself with the Buddha and was fascinated by their similarity. The Blessed One promptly checked him by preaching the Mahà Ràhulovàda Sutta . Vàda here means advice. There was a touching story of Ràhula spending one whole night at the lavatory used by the Buddha, being pressed for space. This was due to the Blessed One promulgating a rule. It would appear that the laity had a habit of overstay- ing in the temple for days to hear religious discourses. Besides, some came from far away places. Most of these people disport themselves in various repulsive ways while asleep. It was not proper that monks should sleep in their midst. It is interesting to note that, in answer to a knock at the door of the lavatory by the Buddha, Ràhula exclaimed, “I Ràhula” instead of simply saying the meaningless “It is I” which many would say. The Buddha forthwith summoned the monks headed by Sàriputta to narrate the episode."},{"pageNumber":1400,"pageContent":"140 0 The Buddha thereupon, relaxed the rule so that it operated only after the third day. This became the ruling topic of conversation of the monks. Venerable Ràhula, the son of the Buddha, was so modest and unassuming when he could be otherwise. Buddha, having heard this, narrated a small story called Tipalatthamiga Jàtaka of the past to show that Ràhula’s character was so even in the remote past. “Once upon a time in Vàràõasã when Magada was the king and the Bodhisatta was a leader of a herd of deer. This leader had a young nephew and, at the request of his mother, the leader undertook to teach him the arts and crafts by which they could outwit their enemies. One day, the young deer was trapped. So he fainted and feigned to be dead. His stomach got puffed up and he kept his breathing under control so much so that even the crows and fl ies were hovering about the body. The hunter, taking the deer to be dead, released the deer for making a meal of it on the spot. A fi re was kindled. The young deer at once got up and took to his heels.” The Theragàtha contains four verses said to have been spoken by Ràhula. Buddha, addressing the monks, said that among his great arahats, Venerable Ràhula was pre-eminent for the observance of the precepts. Ràhula was a great arahat foremost for the observance of precepts. The details of his life more or less coincide with those of the life of the Mahà arahat called Raññhapàla. Born into wealthy families and though little was known of their previous lives, on coming of age like Sumedha of old, they gave up their wealth. Both felt that it was foolish to amass wealth. They distributed the wealth among the poor to become hermits. At this time two hermits enjoying psychic power came, one from the kingdom of the Nàga, whose king was called Pathavindara, and the other from the heavenly realm of the thirty-three deities ( tàvatiüsa ). Each hermit had a pupil. The hermits not only gave their blessing but also extolled the virtues of their respective abodes. On death, each hermit was born in the region from which each hailed. One was therefore, born in Pathavindara as king of Nàgas and the other as Sakka in the heavenly abode. Pathavindara and Sàkka decided to be born together on Earth, as a Buddha was appearing on Earth, and the two were Ràhula and Raññhapàla."},{"pageNumber":1401,"pageContent":"353.

On one occasion, at a meeting of the devas in the Tàvatiüsa realm, four questions were raised, but the devas failed to get the correct answers. Eventually, Sakka took these devas to the Buddha at the Jetavana Monastery. After explaining their diffi - culty, Sakka presented the following four questions: ( 1) Among gifts, which is the best? (2) Among tastes, which is the best? (3) Among delights, which is the best? (4) Why is the eradication of craving said to be the most excellent? To these questions, the Buddha replied, “O’ Sakka, the Dhamma is the noblest of all gifts, the best of all tastes and the best of all delights. Eradication of craving leads to the attainment of arahatship and is, therefore, the greatest of all conquests.” At the end of the discourse, Sakka said to the Buddha, “Venerable, if the gift of the Dhamma excels all gifts why are we not invited to share the merit whenever gifts of the Dhamma are made?

On one occa- sion, King Pasenadi of Kosala came to pay homage to the Buddha. He explained to the Buddha that he was late because earlier that day a rich man had died in Sàvatthi without leav- ing any heirs, and so he had to confi scate all that man’s prop- erty. Then, he proceeded to relate about the man who, although very rich, was very stingy. While he lived, he did not give away anything in charity. He was reluctant to spend his money even on himself and, therefore, ate very sparingly and wore only cheap, coarse clothes. On hearing this the Buddha told the king and the audience about the man in a past exist- ence. In that existence also he was a rich man. One day, when a paccekabuddha (recluse Buddha) came and stood for alms at his house, he told his wife to offer some- thing to the paccekabuddha . His wife thought it was very rarely that her husband gave her permission to give anything to anybody. So, she fi lled up the alms-bowl with some choice food. The rich man again met the paccekabuddha on his way home and he had a look at the alms-bowl. Seeing that his wife had offered a substantial amount of good food, he thought, “Oh, this monk would only have a good sleep after a good meal. It would have been better if my servants were given such good food; at least, they would have given me better service.” In other words, he regretted that he had asked his"},{"pageNumber":1409,"pageContent":"1409 wife to offer food to the paccekabuddha . This same man had a brother who also was a rich man. His brother had an only son.

Because the man had offered alms-food to the pacceka- buddha , he became a rich man in his present life; because he regretted having offered food to the paccekabuddha , he had no wish to spend anything even on himself. Because he had killed his own nephew for the sake of his brother’s wealth he had to suffer in hell for seven existences. His bad kamma having come to an end he was born into the human world but here also he had not gained any good kamma. The king then remarked, “Venerable!

This was the good deed which he performed in a previous state of existence. Although Ankura had for ten thousand years set up a row of fi re-places twelve leagues long and had given abundant alms, Indaka received a greater reward; therefore spoke Indaka thus. When he had thus spoken, the Buddha said, “Ankura, one should use dis- crimination in giving alms. Under such circumstances almsgiving, like seed sown on good soil, yields abundant fruit. But you have not so done; therefore your gifts have yielded no great fruit.” And to make this matter clear, he said, “Alms should always be given with discrimination. Alms so given yield abundant fruit.” The giving of alms with discrimination is extolled by the happy one. Alms given to living beings here in the world who are worthy of offerings, yield abundant fruit, like seeds sown on good ground. Having thus spoken, He expounded the Dhamma.

The minds of those who know this conditioned state Are delivered by destroying that to which becoming leads: They realize the Dhamma’s essence and in stillness Delighting, steadfast they abandon all becoming.

One attains arahatship, that is deliverance even while alive, by rooting out lust, hate and delusion. As stated above, this is known as the Nibbàna element with a basis remaining ( saupàdisesa nibbànadhàtu ). The arahat’s fi ve aggregates or the remaining bases are conditioned by the lust, hate and delusion of his infi nite past. As he still lives his aggregates function, he, therefore, experiences the pleasant as well as painful feelings that his sense faculties entertain through contact with sense objects. But, since he is freed from attachment, discrimination and the idea of selfhood, he is not moved by these feelings. Now, when an arahat passes away, his aggregates, his remain- ing bases, cease to function; they break up at death; his feelings are no more, and because of his eradication of lust, hate and delusion, he is not reborn, and naturally, there is then no more entertaining of feelings; and, therefore, is it said: His feelings will become cool ( sãtibhavissanti ). The idea is expressed in the Udàna thus: The body broke up, perception ceased, All feelings cooled, all formations stilled, Consciousness disappeared.

His mind is unshaken by contact with worldly contingencies; he is sorrowless, taintless and secure ( asokaü , virajaü , khemaü ). Thus, Nibbàna is a ‘state’ realizable in this very life ( diññhadhamma- nibbàna ). The thinker, the inquiring mind, will not fi nd it diffi cult to understand this state, which can be postulated only of the arahat and not of any other being, either in this world or in the realms of heavenly enjoyment. Though the sentient being experiences the unsatisfactory nature of life, and knows, at fi rst hand, what suffering is, what defi lements are, and what it is to crave, he does not know what the total extirpation of defi lements is, because he has never experienced it. Should he do so, he will know, through self-realization, what it is to be without defi lements, what Nibbàna or reality is, what true happiness is. The arahat speaks of Nibbàna with experience, and not by hearsay, but the arahat can never, by his realization, make others understand Nibbàna. One who has slaked his thirst knows the release he has gained, but he cannot explain this release to another. However much he may talk of it, others will not experience it; for it is self-experience, self-realization. Realiza- tion is personal to each individual.

These four stanzas extol the virtues of dàna , generosity. Dàna is the fi rst pàramã . It confers upon the giver double blessing of inhibiting immoral thoughts of selfi shness, while developing pure thoughts of selfl essness: It blesseth him that gives, him that takes. A Bodhisatta is not concerned as to whether the recipient is truly in need or not, for his one object in practicing generosity, as he does, is to eliminate craving that lies dormant within himself. The joy of serv- ice, its attendant happiness, and the alleviation of suffering are other blessings of generosity. In extending his love with supernormal generosity, he makes no distinction between one being and another, but he uses judicious dis- crimination in this generosity. If, for instance, a drunkard were to seek his help, and, if he were convinced that the drunkard would misuse his gift, the Bodhisatta, without hesitation, would refuse it, for such misplaced generosity would not constitute a pàramã . Should anyone seek his help for a worthy purpose, then instead of assuming a forced air of dignity or making false pretensions, he would simply express his deep obligation for the opportunity afforded, and willingly and humbly render every possible aid. Yet he would never set it down to his own credit as a favour conferred upon another, nor would he ever regard the man as his debtor for the service ren- dered. He is interested only in the good act, but in nothing else spring- ing from it.

Now we should like to have you tell us which one of us is guarding the door that is the most diffi cult to guard.” The Buddha carefully avoided placing any one of the monks in a position inferior to that of his fellows and said in reply, “Monks, all of these doors are diffi cult to guard. But this is not the fi rst time you have failed to control yourselves in these fi ve particulars.

From great peril, I came steadfast. Having recited this stanza, the Buddha summarized the Jàtaka as follows: “At that time you were the fi ve men who, when the great being went forth to take the kingdom of Tak- kasilà, stood round about him with weapons in your hands, guarding the road. But when, as you journeyed by the way, the female evil spirits tempted you with objects pleasing to the senses of sight and sound and smell and taste and touch, then you threw off all restraint, then you disregarded the admonitions of the wise man, then you yielded to the seduc- tions of the female evil spirits; and they devoured you, and you were utterly destroyed.

Commentary In these verses, the Buddha admonishes the monks to be disciplined by guarding all ‘doors of perception’. The only means of achieving this aim is meditation ( bhàvanà ). Meditation by means of mind development is called bhàvanà . Unlike other technical terms, bhàvanà is used to denote only the practi- cal methods of mental training. It embraces in its vast connotation the whole system, together with the practices that have been developed from it. When the term bhàvanà occurs in the Scriptures, it generally indicates the practice or cultivation of meditation and the verb bhàveti is used to denote the act, ‘to practice’, or ‘to cultivate’: Mettaü , Ràhula , bhàvanaü , bhàvehi . Ràhula, practice the meditation upon friendliness. Asubhàya cittaü bhàvehi . Cultivate the mind by the meditation upon impurities. Unlike jhàyati , (which is only used to indicate thinking upon a men- tal object, or holding a mental image taken from an external object), bhàveti is used of any form of mental development: Kusalaü cittaü bhàveti , he cultivates or increases moral consciousness; “ Jhànaü bhàveti , Saüàdhiü bhàveti , Vipassanaü bhàveti , maggaü bhàveti ,” “he practises jhàna , samàdhi vipassanà or the path.” The term bhàvanà is to be found compounded with words implying the subjects of meditation, as, jhàna-bhàvanà , samàdhi-bhàvanà , metta-bhàvanà , and so on, in order to distinguish the different kinds of meditation."},{"pageNumber":1431,"pageContent":"14 31 Buddhaghosa Thera defi ned the verb bhàveti as a derivation from the root bhu – to be or to become and compares it with janeti (begets), uppàdeti (produces or causes to rise), vaóóheti (increases or develops). He quotes passages from the Scriptures to show that bhàveti is used in the sense of producing, ( uppàdana ) and increasing ( vaddhana ). Bhàvanà has a meaning that is stronger and more active than that of the English word meditation. The word has various renderings, such as producing, acquiring, mastering, developing, cultivating, refl ection and meditation. Here, we shall use the word in the sense of practice and cultivation, translations which bring out more clearly than the word ‘meditation’ its connection with the root to be or to become. It is true that in bhàvanà there is a certain thought process, simi- lar to that involved in mental prayer, and also the repetition of some particular words or phrases i n different practices, such as be happy, be happy in the practice of mettà ; or earth, earth, (in Kasiõa practice), as in verbal prayer. But bhàvanà is more than that. It is thinking in a special manner, to edify something in oneself, something which is always good. The essential thing, therefore, in bhàvanà is its productive fac- tor, that which produces or manifests the essential quality or truth that is contained in the object of thought, within one’s character. For example, when one practises mettà bhàvanà , one not only thinks upon friendliness but also makes it come into being, and grow stronger and stronger in his mind, so as to eradicate thoughts of enmity, mal- ice, aversion and the like; and fi nally, the aspirant becomes friendly towards all living things. In this sense, it is becoming. In conclusion, let it be said that the word bhàvanà means the accumulation of all good qualities within oneself, to become apt and fi t for the attainment of Nibbàna. Moreover, bhàvanà is the popular, current expression for meditation as a part of religious life in the Theravàda school."},{"pageNumber":1432,"pageContent":"362.

One day they went to the Aciravatã River, and after bathing, stood on the bank basking themselves in the rays of the sun, engaged in pleasant conversation. At that moment two geese came fl ying through the air. Thereupon one of the young monks, picking up a pebble, said, “I am going to hit one of these young geese in the eye.” “You can’t do it,” said the other. “You just wait,” said the fi rst; “I will hit the eye on this side of him, and then I will hit the eye on the other side of him.” “You can’t do that, either,” said the second. “Well then, see for yourself,” said the fi rst, and taking a second pebble, threw it after the goose. The goose, hearing the stone whiz through the air, turned his head and looked back. Then the second monk picked up a round stone and threw it in such a way that it hit the eye on the far side and came out of the eye on the near side.

Commentary samàhito : a mind that is tranquil: a mind that has attained samàdhi – tranquility through total concentration. The word samàdhi is best rendered by concentration. More- over, it is one of the original terms used by the Buddha himself, for it occurs in His fi rst Sermon. It is used in the sense of sammà-samàdhi , right concentration. Samàdhi from the root saüàdhà , to put together, to concentrate, refers to a certain state of mind. In a technical sense it signifi es both the state of mind and the method designed to induce that state. In the dialogue between the sister Dhammadinnà and the devotee Visàkhà, Samàdhi is discussed both as a state of mind and a method of mental training. Visàkhà asked, “What is Samàdhi ?” The sister replied, “ Samàdhi is cittassa ekaggatà (literally, one- pointedness of mind).” “What induces it?” “The four applications of mind- fulness ( Satipaññhàna ), induce it.” “What are its requisites?” “The four supreme efforts ( sammappadhàna ) are its requisites.” “What is the culture ( Bhàvanà ) of it?” “Cultivation and increase of those self- same principles – mindfulness and supreme effort, are the culture of it.” In this discussion samàdhi , as a mental state, is defi ned as cit- tassa ekaggatà , and this appears to be the fi rst defi nition of it in the Suttas.

Now after Kokàlika had been reborn in the lotus hell, the monks in the hall of truth began a discussion of the occur- rence, saying, “Alas, the monk Kokàlika went to perdition because he failed to hold his tongue! For even as he reviled the two chief disciples, the earth opened and swallowed him up.” At that moment the Buddha approached and asked. “Monks, what subject are you discussing now as you sit here all gathered together?” When they told him, he said, “Monks, this is not the fi rst time Kokàlika has gone to perdition because of failure to hold his tongue; the same thing happened to him in a former state of existence also.” The monks immediately desired to hear all about the matter. In compliance with their requests, to make the matter clear, the Buddha related the fol- lowing. Once upon a time a tortoise dwelt in a certain lake in the Himàlaya country. One day two young geese, wandering about in search of food, struck up an acquaintance with him, and in a short time all became fi rm friends. One day the geese said to the tortoise, “Friend tortoise, we live in the Himàlaya country on Mount Cittakåña in a golden cave, and it is a most delightful place to live in. Wouldn’t you like to go there with us?” “Masters,” replied the tortoise, “how am I to get there?” Said the geese, “If you can keep your mouth shut, we will"},{"pageNumber":1438,"pageContent":"14 38 carry you.” The tortoise replied, “I will keep my mouth shut, friends. Take me with you, and let’s be off.” “Very well,” said the geese. So the geese made the tortoise grip with his teeth the middle of a stick, and then, taking the two ends of the stick in their bills, fl ew up into the air. Some village boys, seeing a tortoise carried along in this fashion by geese, immediately cried out, “See those two geese carrying a tortoise on a stick!” Thought the tortoise, “You vagabonds, what business is it of yours if my friends are car- rying me with them?” And he opened his mouth, intending to say what was in his mind. Now the geese were fl ying very swiftly, and by this time they had reached a point directly over the royal palace in Vàràõasi city. So when the tortoise let go of the stick, he fell to the ground right in the middle of the palace court, and the moment he struck the ground, split into two pieces. Having related this Bahubhàõi Jàtaka, found in the sec- ond book, the Buddha said, “Monks, a monk should control his tongue, should live tranquilly, should not allow himself to become puffed up, and should free his heart from the evil passions.” Explanatory Translation (Verse 363) mukhasa¤¤ato mantabhànã anuddhato yo bhikkhu atthaü dhamma¤ca dãpeti tassa bhàsitaü madhuraü mukhasa¤¤ato : disciplined in mouth; mantabhànã : speaking in moderation; anuddhato : not proud; yo bhikkhu :"},{"pageNumber":1439,"pageContent":"14 39 a monk; atthaü : the significance; dhamma : the teaching; dãpeti : it demonstrates; tassa : his; bhàsitaü : utterance; madhuraü : sweet The monk who controls his mouth (speech) who speaks wisely with his mind composed, who explains the meaning of the text of the Dhamma – sweet are the words of that monk.

The Buddha pointed out fi ve disad- vantages and dangers in unguarded, undisciplined speech. One who is not disciplined in speech is (i) given to lying; (ii) tending to slander, (iii) tending to be harsh and idle in speech; and (iv) born in evil states after death. There are four virtues of right speech. They are: (1) one abstains from lying. Such a person is sincere, upright and dependable; (2) the person who practises right speech does not slander or bear tales. The person who avoids these forms of evil speech contributes towards social harmony; (3) those who practise right speech refrain from using harsh words. This way, they give happiness to people and avoid the possibility of creating mental pain which is likely if harsh words are used and (4) it enables the practitioner to avoid frivolous unprofi table words.

Contentment with whatever you receive is described as appicchatà and paccaya santosa . Appicchatà – having only a few wishes (contentedness) – is one of the indispensable virtues of the monk. The four noble usages of a monk are: contentedness (of the monk) with any robe, contentedness with"},{"pageNumber":1449,"pageContent":"14 49 any alms food, contentedness with any dwelling, and delight in medita- tion and detachment. “Now, the monk is contented with any robe, with any alms food, with any dwelling, fi nds pleasure and enjoyment in mental training and detachment. But neither is he haughty on that account, nor does he look down upon others. Now, of a monk who herein is fi t and indefatigable, who remains clearly conscious and mindful, of such a monk it is said that he is fi rmly established in the ancient, Noble Usages known as the most lofty ones.” The Bhikkhu Order : The Order of bhikkhus (the Buddhahood) started with the fi ve-fold monks to whom the Buddha preached his fi rst sermon. From that time the Sangha grew after the admission of Yasa to the Sangha. In Vàràõasã there was a millionaire’s son, named Yasa, who led a luxurious life. Realizing the vanities of worldly life, he stole away from home, saying “Distressed am I, oppressed am I”, and went in the direction of Isipatana where the Buddha was temporarily residing after having ena- bled the fi ve monks to attain arahantship. Thereupon the Buddha said – “Here there is no distress, O Yasa! Here there is no oppression, O Yasa! Come hither, Yasa! Take a seat. I shall expound the Dhamma to you.” The distressed Yasa was pleased to hear the encouraging words of the Buddha. Removing his golden sandals, he approached the Buddha, respectfully saluted Him and sat on one side. The Buddha expounded the doctrine to him, and he attained the fi rst stage of sainthood ( sotàpatti ). At fi rst the Buddha spoke to him on generosity ( dàna ), morality ( sãla ), celestial states ( sagga ), the evils of sensual pleasure ( kàmàdãnava ), the bless- ings of renunciation ( nekkhammànisaüsa ). When He found that his mind was pliable and was ready to appreciate the deeper teachings He taught the four noble truths. Yasa’s mother was the fi rst to notice the absence of her son and she reported the matter to her husband. The millionaire immediately dispatched horsemen in four directions and he himself went towards Isi- patana, following the imprint of the golden slippers. The Buddha saw him coming from afar and, by His psychic powers, willed that he should not be able to see his son. The millionaire approached the Buddha and respect- fully inquired whether He saw his son Yasa. ‘Well then, sir, down here please. You would be able to see your son,” said the Buddha. Pleased with the happy news, he sat down. The"},{"pageNumber":1450,"pageContent":"1450 Buddha delivered a discourse to him, and he was so delighted that he exclaimed. “Excellent! It is as if a man were to set upright that which was over- turned, or were to reveal that which was hidden, or were to point out the way to one who had gone astray, or were to hold a lamp amidst the dark- ness, so that those who have eyes may see! Even so has the doctrine been expounded in various ways by the Buddha.” “I take refuge in the Buddha, the Doctrine and the Sangha. May the Buddha receive me as a follower, who has taken refuge from this very day to life’s end!” He was the fi rst lay follower to seek refuge with the threefold formula. The hearing the discourse delivered to his father, Yasa attained arahantship. Thereupon the Buddha withdrew His will-power so that Yasa’s father might be able to see his son. The millionaire beheld his son and invited the Buddha and His disciples for alms on the following day. The Buddha expressed His acceptance of the invitation by His silence. After the departure of the rich man Yasa begged the Buddha to grant him the lesser and the higher ordination. “Come, O monks! What I taught is the Doctrine. Lead the holy life to make a complete end of suffer- ing.” With these words the Buddha conferred on him the higher ordination. With the Venerable Yasa the number of arahants increased to six. As invited, the Buddha visited the rich man’s house with his six disciples. Venerable Yasa’s mother and his former wife heard the doctrine expounded by the Buddha and, having attained the fi rst stage of sainthood, became His fi rst two lay female followers.” Venerable Yasa had four distinguished friends named Vimala, Subàhu, Punnaji, and Gavampati. When they heard that their noble friend had shaved his hair and beard and, donning the yellow robe, entered the homeless life, they approached Venerable Yasa and expressed their desire to follow his example. Venerable Yasa introduced them to the Buddha, and on hearing the Dhamma, they also attained arahantship. Fifty more worthy friends of Venerable Yasa, who belonged to leading families of various districts, also receiving instructions from the Buddha, attained arahantship and entered the holy Sangha. Hardly two months had elapsed since His Enlightenment when the number of arahants gradually rose to sixty. All of them came from distinguished families and were worthy sons of worthy fathers."},{"pageNumber":1451,"pageContent":"367.

Seeing his gesture, the bràhmin’s wife could not control herself and she burst out laughing. At that instant, the bràhmin turned round and saw the Buddha. At once he knew what his wife had done, and cried out, ‘Wife, I am ruined. When our Venerable Teacher stood at the door you should have informed me. By failing to do so you have embarrassed me greatly.” Then, taking up his plate of rice, he approached the Buddha and apologetically requested, “Venerable!

I am very sorry indeed that I have to offer you partly consumed food.” To him the Buddha replied, “O bràhmin!

The Buddha knew that both the bràhmin and his wife had already learned something about mind and body ( nàma-råpa ), so he answered, “O bràhmin! One who is not attached to mind and body is called a monk.” At the conclu- sion of the discourse, both the bràhmin and his wife attained the third stage of sainthood.

The Venerable kept saying, “Soõa, it is a dif- fi cult matter to eat alone and lodge alone and live a life of chastity,” and twice turned him away. But Soõa was determined to become a monk, and on asking the Venerable the third time, succeeded in obtaining admission to the Sangha. On account of the scarcity of monks in the South, he spent three years in that country, and then made his full profession as a member of the Sangha.

On reaching Jetavana, he saluted the Buddha, who greeted him in a friendly manner and permitted him to lodge in the perfumed chamber alone with himself. Soõa spent the greater part of the night in the open air, and then, entering the perfumed chamber, spent the rest of the night on the couch assigned to him for his own use. When the dawn came, he intoned by command of the Buddha all of the sixteen octads. When he had completed his recitation of the text, the Buddha thanked him and applauded him, saying, “Well done, well done, monk!” Hearing the applause bestowed upon him by the Buddha, the deities, beginning with deities of the earth, nàgas and the supaõõas, and extending to the world of brahmà, gave one shout of applause. At that moment also the deity resident in the house of the eminent female lay disciple who was the mother of the Venerable Soõa in Kuràraghàra city, at a distance of a hundred and twenty leagues from the Jetavana, gave a loud shout of applause. The female lay disciple said to the deity, “Who is this that gives applause?” The deity replied, “It is I, sister.” “Who are you?” “I am the deity resident in your house.” “You have never before bestowed applause upon me; why do you do so today?” “I am not bestowing applause upon you.” “Then upon whom are you bestowing applause?” “Upon your son Venerable Kåñikaõõa Soõa.” “What has my son done?” “Today, your son, residing alone with the Buddha in the perfumed chamber, recited the Dhamma to the Buddha.

Then the fol- lowing thought occurred to her, “If my son has been able, residing alone with the Buddha in the perfumed chamber, to recite the Dhamma to him, he will be able to recite the Dhamma to me also. When my son returns, I will arrange for a hearing of the Dhamma and will listen to his preaching of the Dhamma.” When the Buddha bestowed applause upon Venerable Soõa, the Venerable thought to himself, “Now is the time for me to announce the message which my preceptor gave me.” Accordingly Venerable Soõa asked the Buddha for fi ve boons, asking fi rst for full admission to the Sangha community of fi ve monks in the borderlands, of whom one was a monk versed in the Vinaya. For a few days longer he resided with the Buddha, and then, thinking to himself, “I will now go see my preceptor,” took leave of the Buddha, departed from the Jetavana Monastery, and in due course arrived at the abode of his preceptor. On the following day Venerable Kaccàna took Venerable Soõa with him and set out on his round for alms, going to the door of the house of the female lay disciple who was the mother of Soõa.

Close to the trench, great iron pickets had been sunk in the ground in unbroken succession. Such were the precautionary measures against thieves taken by this female lay disciple. By reason of the defenses without the house and the presence of the lay disciple within, those thieves had been unable to fi nd any way of getting in. But on that particular day, observing that she had left the house, they dug a tunnel under the leaden trench and the iron pickets, and thus suc- ceeded in getting into the house. Having effected an entrance into the house, they sent the ringleader to watch the mistress of the house, saying to him, “If she hears that we have entered the house, and turns and sets out in the direction of the house, strike her with your sword and kill her.” The ringleader went and stood beside her.

If you come back here once more, I shall deal with you according to your deserts. Go back home again.” So saying, she sent her back. When the leader of the thieves heard these words of the female lay disciple, he said to himself, “If we steal the prop- erty of such a woman as this, Indra’s thunderbolt will fall and break our heads.” So he went to the thieves and said, “Hurry and put back the wealth of the female lay disciple where it was before.” So the thieves fi lled again the room where the copper coins were kept with the copper coins, and the gold and silver rooms with the gold and silver coins.

Then said the thieves to the female lay disciple, “My lady, if you pardon us, obtain for us the privilege of entering the Sangha under your son.” The female lay disciple saluted her son and said “Dear son, these thieves are so pleased with my good qualities and with your recitation of the Dhamma, that they desire to be admitted to the Sangha; admit them to the Sangha.” “Very well,” replied the Venerable. So he caused the skirts of the undergarments they wore to be cut off, had their garments dyed with red clay, admitted them to the Sangha, and estab- lished them in the Precepts.

Commentary mettàvihàri : In the Buddhist system considerable emphasis is placed on living with loving-kindness which is mettàvihàri . Mettà , unbounded benevolence or friendliness, in itself emphasizes the positive nature of the self-sacrifi ce and devoted service of the aspir- ant, which is not confi ned to any one part or portion of existence, but is extended over the whole universe to include all beings, from the highest to the lowest, and from the greatest to the most minute form of life. Mettà , as exemplifi ed in the Buddha and in his followers and expounded in the scriptures, is not an evanescent exhibition of emotion, but a sustained and habitual mental attitude of service, goodwill and friendship, which fi nds expression in deed, word and thought. There are numerous passages which can be collated to testify to the vital importance attached to this divine state in the Buddha’s Teaching. The exercise of mettà , which, psychologically speaking, is a moral attribute, tends to the cultivation of the emotional sentiment of goodwill, rather than meditation itself. The disciple should, however, practice mettà in conjunction with other forms of meditation; for it is indispensable to one who seeks to purify his mind from anger and malice. Moreover, he will fi nd that it is an essential support in the exercise of meditation, bringing immediate success and providing the means of protection from external hindrances with which he may have to contend. In the Mahà Ràhulovàda Sutta we read of the Buddha advising his son, the Venerable Ràhula, to practice mettà on the ground that when it is cultivated, anger will disappear. In the Meghiya Sutta it is recommended to the Venerable Meghiya, who failed to achieve success in meditation at fi rst, owing to the persistent arising of evil thoughts. He afterwards attained Arahatship, having expelled and excluded evil thoughts with the aid of the mettà he had developed."},{"pageNumber":1477,"pageContent":"147 7 Several methods of practicing mettà , as an independent form of meditation, are expounded in the canon in various connexions. In the treatment of this subject we should give more especial consideration to four methods that appear in the Sutta Piñaka . Of these four, the formula of the four-fold Brahmavihàra exercise which occurs most frequently in the Nãkàyas and which may be found in the Te v ijj a Sutta , deals principally with the method of ‘Disàpharana’. This consists in suffusing the whole world with the thought of mettà , expanded in all directions, and is associated with the jhàna stages. We quote this formula here, together with its Pàli version, in order to show its distinctive character: So mettàsahagatena cetasà ekaü disaü pharitvà viharati. Tathà dutiyaü, tathà catutthaü, iti uddhaü adho, tiriyaü, sabbadhi, sabbattatàya, sabbàvantaü lokaü mettàsahagatena cetasà, vipulena, mahaggatena, appamàõena, averena, abyàpajjena pharitvà viharati. Literally rendered thus: He abides suffusing one quarter with (his) mind associated with friendliness. Likewise, the second, the third, and the fourth; thus above, below, around, everywhere, all as himself, the whole wide world, he abides suffusing with mind associated with friendliness, abundant, grown great, immeasurable, free from enmity, free from ill-will. This formula is discussed by Buddhaghosa Thera in his Visuddhimagga , where he distinguishes it as vikubbanà , a term which also occurs in connec- tion with the iddhividha as vikubbanà-iddhi , where it means exercising psy- chic power of various forms. It implies the establishment of an immense sphere of benevolent thought, which is increased to the appaõà or the jhàna stage. Hence, this formula indicates the habitual mental attitude of him who has attained to jhàna by the practice of mettà and we fi nd it repeated with the substitution, one by one, of the other altruistic emotions of karuõà , mudità and upekkhà ."},{"pageNumber":1478,"pageContent":"1478 Being the statement of the special mode of living to be adopted by the religious aspirant, this formula emphatically expresses his mental attitude in relation to the external world, especially in the jhàna state. Furthermore, it describes the outlook of the man who neither tortures himself nor infl icts injury upon others, but lives satisfi ed, tranquil, and cool, enjoying the happiness of serenity, himself a brahma ( brahma bhåtena attanà ). The special context of the formula corresponds to the Upàli Sutta where it is stated that those who have attained jhàna and psychic powers, but have not yet cultivated mettà , can destroy others by the mere disturbance of their minds through anger. It is said that in ancient days, the forests named Daõóaka, Kàliïga, Mejjha, and Màtaïga, became forests because of the anger of certain ancient sages ( pubbakà isayo ). But the disciple of the Buddha, as the formula says, abides suf- fusing the entire universe with his boundless love of mettà , free from all anger and malice. The well-known Metta Sutta , or Karaõãya Metta Sutta , sets forth the manner in which mettà should be practiced, both as means of self- protection and as a kammaññhàna . It is there emphasized as an essential duty of the disciple who follows this system of religious training, seeking happiness and peace. This Sutta is one of the most important discourses selected for reciting during religious services and chanting at the Paritta ceremony, which is usually held on auspicious occasions, or in cases of affl iction, epidemic, or individual sickness. It has a special importance for the disciple of meditation. In the Yogà v a c a ra ’ s Manual , we read that the Metta Sutta i s to be re c ite d in its Pàli form, as part of the invocation that should precede all exercises in meditation. The text of this Sutta is supposed to be so arranged that the words themselves have a certain sonorous power, to which importance is attached, and it is always chanted with a special intonation. But the main purpose of the Sutta is to expound the practice of mettà and to formulate a defi nite system of contemplative exercise. Moreover, it is a more special expansion of the method of suffusing mettà and corresponds to that shown in the formula of the Te v ijj a Sutta . Furthermore, it is in this Metta Sutta that mettà is compared to motherly love and named especially as a brahma- vihàra . The practice of this meditation alone leads to emancipation from re-birth, as emphasized in the saying, ‘So, shall he never come back again to re-birth.’"},{"pageNumber":1479,"pageContent":"1479 The other special application of mettà is found in the Khandha Paritta , where it is given as a safeguard against harm from snakes. This states that a certain monk of Sàvatthi died as the result of receiving a snake-bite. A number of monks brought the news to the Buddha, who is reported to have said, “The monk had not practiced metta towards the four families of snakes. There are four families ( kula ) of snakes, namely, viråpakkha , eràpatha , chabyàputta and kaõhàgotamaka . Had he practiced mettà towards these four kinds of snakes, he would not have died of snake-bite. I advise you, monks, to suffuse them with friendly thoughts (lit. mind – mettena cittena pharituü ) for your own safeguard and protection.” The actual method of suffusing is given here in verses, and is to be extended gradually, proceeding from the four families of snakes, thus: May I have friendliness with the viråpakkhas , May I have friendliness with the chabyàputtas , With the eràpathas may I friendliness have, With the kaõhàgotamakas may I have friendliness. The suffusion is then gradually extended, advancing in stages, and includ- ing different kinds of creatures; the footless, those that have two feet, the quadrupeds and the many-footed. Thereafter, the disciple’s aspiration follows thus: Let not the footless do me harm, Nor those that have two feet; Let not the quadrupeds do me harm, Nor those with many feet. He then continues, developing suffusion immeasurable: Sabbe sattà sabbe pàõà Sabbe bhåtà ca kevalà – Sabbe bhadràni passantu; Mà ka¤ci pàpamàgamà. May all beings, all living things, All that are born, and everyone, May all see happiness, And may no harm befall."},{"pageNumber":1480,"pageContent":"148 0 This stanza contains some of the actual words (such as sabbe sattà , sabbe pànà , sabbe bhåtà and so on) that occur in the formula for meditation, as given in later works. Then follows the invocation: Infi nite is the virtue of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha; Finite are creeping things, such as snakes, scorpions, centipedes, spiders, house lizards, rats and mice. I have done my warding, my protection. Let all creatures turn away in peace. Reverence to the Buddha, reverence to the seven fully Enlightened Ones. This sutta has a very long and fi rmly established tradition. It occurs in the Khandha-Vatta Jàtaka where the Bodhisatta advised his followers to observe this paritta (which is given in the same form) as a protection against ser- pents; for they were living in a spot in the Himàlayan valley where such poisonous creatures were abundant. Observing this advice, the ascetics are said to have long lived unharmed, during the period that the Bodhisatta himself, who was practicing the brahma-vihàras , was bound to the brahma world. In relating this story of his past experience the Buddha advised the monks to observe the same paritta . This meditational exercise is given in the Khuddaka-Vatta-Khandhaka of the Cullavagga as a rule of discipline and duty, and the special name Khandha Paritta is probably adopted from this connection. Of these two parittas , the method expounded in the Metta Sutta corresponds to the practice as followed in the jhàna stage, as does also the formula found in the Te v ijj a Sutta ; while the other seems to be a more primitive form of suffusion. Both, however, contain the anodhiso , the unlim- ited, and the odhiso , the limited forms of suffusion, which are explained in the Pañisambhidà-magga , as will be seen below. Both methods, the unlimited and the limited, combine with that of disàpharaõa , suffusing through all the directions or quarters given in the formula of the four-fold exercise. They may differ in the letter, but the spirit is the same everywhere. A more widely extended suffusion of mettà , which corresponds to these formulae, is mentioned in the Mettàkathà of the Patisambhidà-magga , where we fi nd a detailed description of several methods, arranged in"},{"pageNumber":1481,"pageContent":"1481 numerical order; they are combined severally with the Bodhipakkhiya prin- ciples of the fi ve indriyas , the fi ve balas , the seven bojjhaõgas and the eight- fold path. First, the Mettànisaüsa is quoted, a discourse that occurs in the Aõguttara Nikàya and sets forth eleven advantages of Mettà-bhàvanà . Then the following methods of suffusing mettà are enumerated: there are three methods, namely: (1) Anodhiso Pharanà – suffusing without a limit; (2) odhiso Pharanà – suffusing with a limit, and (3) Disà Pharanà – suffusing through the directions or quarters. (1) The Anodhiso method is sub-divided into fi ve, each section forming a separate meditation formula. They are: (i) sabbe sattà – all beings; (ii) sabbe pàõà – all living things; (iii) sabbe bhåtà – all creatures; (iv) Sabbe puggalà – all persons or individuals and (v) sabbe attabhàva pariyàpannà – all that have come to individual  existence. Each of these fi ve is linked with the four copulas of aspiration: (a) averà hontu – let [them] be free from enmity; (b) abyàpajjà hontu – let [them] be free from ill-will; (c) anighà hontu – let [them] be rid of ill and (d) sukhã attànaü pariharantu – let [them] keep themselves happy. In the case of the abovementioned the full formula should be repeated, thus: Let all beings be free from enmity; be free from ill-will; be rid of ill or suffering; and let them keep themselves happy. Likewise: Let all living things, all creatures, all individuals, and all that are existing (each successively), be free from enmity, hatred, ill, and let them keep themselves happy. In following this method the aspirant includes all beings in his thoughts of loving-kindness and pervades them with it, without limita- tion – touching all without localization as the commentary says. Hence, it is anodhiso pharanà , suffusing without a limit or boundary."},{"pageNumber":1482,"pageContent":"1482 (2) There are seven forms of odhiso pharanà , or the limited method: (i) sabbe itthiyo – all females; (ii) Sabbe Purisà – all males; (iii) Sabbe ariyà – all worthy ones, or those who have attained perfection; (iv) sabbe anariyà – all unworthy ones, or those who are imperfect; (v) sabbe devà – all gods; (vi) sabbe manussà – all human beings; (vii) sabbe vinipàtikà – all those in unhappy states. Each of these should be linked with the four aspirations and repeated separately or collectively during the period of meditation. In employing this method the aspirant suffuses mettà , while dividing beings into groups according to their nature and condition. The meditation is, therefore, called odhiso pharanà or suffusing within a limit or portion. (3) There are ten modes of suffusing mettà through the quarters and the intermediate quarters, starting from the East. They comprise the eight points of the compass: the four cardinal points, the four intermediate points, and above and below. The formulas are: Let all beings in the East be free from enmity, hatred, ill, and let them keep themselves happy. In like manner: Let all beings in the West, the North, the South, the North-east, the South-west, the North-west, the South-East, above and below, be free from enmity, etc. In these three methods of suffusing mettà there are twenty-two (fi ve, seven and ten) formulas; and each, according to the commentary, refers to the mettà that leads to the appaõà or jhàna state. Of the fi ve anodhiso pharanàs , ‘Let all beings be free from enmity’ is one Appaõà; ‘Be free from ill-will’ is another; ‘Be rid of ill’ is another; ‘Let them keep themselves happy’ is the fourth."},{"pageNumber":1483,"pageContent":"1483 Thus, in the method of unlimited suffusion, there are twenty appaõàs , that is, four in each of the fi ve formulas. In the same way, four appaõàs in each of the seven formulas give a total of twenty-eight belonging to the method of limited suffusion. The fi ve (i to v) formulas of the odhiso method have also been combined with the ten directions, thus: Let all beings in the East be free from enmity... and so forth. In this way, there are two hundred appaõàs , twenty in each quarter. In like manner, the seven (i to vii) formulas, being combined with the ten directions as: Let all women in the East... and so on give a total of two hundred and eighty appaõàs , that is, twenty-eight in each quarter. There are, thus, four hundred and eighty appaõàs . In all, there are fi ve hun- dred and twenty-eight appaõàs (twenty, twenty-eight, two hundred and two hundred and eighty), mentioned in the Patisambhidà-magga . The commentary states that the other three vihàras , karuõà , mudità and upekkhà , are also employed with the same method of suffusing; and the disciple who practises them by means of any one of these appaõà states, enjoys the eleven blessings spoken of in the following Mettànisaüsa Sutta passage: Monks, from the practice of mettà-cetovimutti or mind-release through friendliness, cultivated, increased, made a vehicle ( yànikatà ), made a basis ( vatthukatà ), persisted in, made familiar, well set forth, eleven blessings are to be expected. What are the eleven? Happy he sleeps; happy he awakes; he dreams no bad dreams; he is dear to men; dear to non-human beings; Devàs guard him; fi re, poison, or sword come not near him; quickly his mind becomes concentrated; his complexion becomes clear; he dies with his mind free from confusion; if he realizes no further attainment, he goes to the bràhma-world."},{"pageNumber":1484,"pageContent":"377.

While thus engaged, they saw jasmine fl owers which had blossomed that very morning, drop- ping in the evening from the stem. Thereupon they thought to themselves, “We will obtain release from lust, hatred, and delusion, before you obtain release from your stems,” and applied themselves to meditation with renewed vigor. The Buddha behold those monks and said, “Monks, even as a fl ower is released from its stem, even so should a monk strive to obtain release from the pain of birth and rebirth.” And even as he sat within the per- fumed chamber, he sent forth a light and pronounced the following stanza, “Monks! As the withered fl ower is shed from the plant, so also should a monk strive to free himself from worldly suffering.” At the conclusion of the lesson, all those monks were established in arahatship.

Commentary This verse relates to a group of monks who meditated upon jasmine fl owers falling to the ground – their stems detaching from the vine. In several instances, meditators achieved higher knowledge by concen- trating on some object. The main purpose of the Buddha’s system of mind-training is to purify the mind from all defi lements and corrup- tions, in order to cultivate its intrinsic pliability so that perfect know- ledge may be attained, which is the means of transcending the states of woe and sorrow. Furthermore, the mental training specifi ed in Buddhism is training in higher thought, in lofty ideals and concentration of the mind upon some principle of a moral and virtuous character. The mind which is wholly given to a single perception of a salutary kind, becomes purely radiant and illuminated in its original state ( pabhassaraüidaü ). In the very beginning, therefore, it is essential to focus the attention upon an object ( àrammaõa ) entirely dissociated from the passions, in order to draw a pure mental picture. This picture the meditator retains as his ideal, and trains his mind to concentrate upon it. The mind becomes pure or impure, not through its own nature, but through the arising of pure and impure thoughts. The object for securing the preliminary attention must, therefore, be associated with"},{"pageNumber":1487,"pageContent":"1487 purity, virtue and truth. Moreover, the object or the ideal selected for meditation must be such as to produce some psychological effect which is suited to the particular disposition of the meditator. The scriptures record that the Buddha realized the diverse mental dispositions and innate tendencies of those who looked to him for deliverance, and recommended them various methods; and these methods have been ever increasingly developed as it became neces- sary to extend the opportunity of training in this system to a greater variety of mental types. These methods were later modifi ed, enlarged and grouped together in different ways forming different schemes of meditation, according to their psychological effect and value in inducing higher states of consciousness, and also with regard to their suitability for various individual characters. They are found in the Nikàyas , in the Abhidhamma and the commentaries, besides other works dealing with meditation, in the form in which they have been practiced and main- tained in the Theravàda school."},{"pageNumber":1488,"pageContent":"378.

Having done that, he utters thrice his lion’s roar. Having thrice spoken his lion’s roar, he sallies forth in search of prey. Now, monks, whatever animals hear the sound of the roaring of the lion, king of beasts, for the most part, they are afraid; they fall to quaking and trembling. Those that dwell in holes seek them; water- dwellers make for the water; forest-dwellers enter the forest; birds mount into the air.

One day a monk saw him going along, clad only in a ragged loin-cloth, with his plough on his shoulder. Said the monk to the ploughman, “If this is the way you make your living, why shouldn’t you become a monk?” “Venerable, who would make a monk of a man that gets his living as I do?” “If you will consent to become a monk, I will make a monk of you.” “Very well, Ven- erable; if you will make a monk of me, I will become a monk.” So that Venerable took him to Jetavana, bathed him with his own hands, and causing him to stand within the enclosure, made a monk of him.

After living for some time on the rich gifts and offerings which are bestowed upon the Buddhas, Venerable Plough- man became discontented.

And in this manner, whenever he became discontented, he would go to the foot of the tree and admonish himself. The monks observed that he went repeatedly to the foot of the tree. So they asked him, “Brother Na¤galakula, why do you go there?” “Venerables, I go there to visit my teacher.” After a few days he attained arahatship. Then the monks made sport of him and said, “Brother Na¤galakula, it appears that you no longer make use of the path by which you used to travel back and forth. Doubtless you go no more to visit your teacher.” “Precisely so, Venerables; when I was of the world, I used to go back and forth; but now that I have severed con- nection with the world, I no longer do so.” When the monks heard this, they reported the matter to the Buddha, saying, “This monk tells what is not true, utters falsehood.” The Buddha said, “Monks, what he says is quite true.

Venerable Vakkali, we are told, was reborn at Sàvatthi in the household of a brahman. One day, after he had reached manhood, he saw the Buddha enter the city for alms. Having surveyed the Buddha’s beauty of person, not satisfi ed with the sight of the beauty of his person, be said to himself, “I will obtain the privilege of looking thus at all times upon the Buddha.” He therefore retired from the world and became a monk under the Buddha. He always stood where he could see the possessor of the ten forces, and abandoning the recitation of the sacred word and the practice of meditation, he spent his whole time gazing upon the Buddha. The Buddha waited for his knowledge to ripen and said not a word. One day the Buddha perceived within himself, “Now his knowledge has ripened;” so he said to him, “Vakkali, what shall it profi t you to look upon this mass of corruption which is called my body? Whosoever, Vakkali, beholds the Dhamma, he beholds me.” Thus did the Buddha admonish Venerable Vakkali. But in spite of the Buddha’s admonition, Vakkali could not let the Buddha get out of his sight or leave his presence.

I will throw myself headlong from the top of a mountain.” And with this thought in mind, he climbed to the top of Mount Vulture Peak. The Buddha, perceiving that he was depressed and weary of the world, thought to himself, “If this monk receives no comfort nor consolation from me, he will destroy his pre- dispositions to the attainment of the paths and the fruits.” Accordingly he sent forth a radiant image of himself and dis- played himself before the gaze of the monk. The moment the monk saw the Buddha, the weight of sorrow which oppressed him vanished, Then the Buddha, as though fi lling the dry bed of a lake with a torrent of water, caused intense joy and satis- faction to spring up within the monk. Venerable Vakkali thought, “I have seen the Possessor of the Ten Forces, and he speaks to me, saying, ‘Come!’” Straightway he experienced profound joy. “How pray shall I go?” thought he. And standing there on the summit of the mountain, though he saw no path, he sprang into the air face to face with the Possessor of the Ten Forces, on hearing the fi rst words of the stanza.

Commentary This verse is related to a very young novice monk who was capable of performing miracles. These miracles are an outcome of concentrated meditation. Meditation as a means of self-development is a positive, dynamic force which leads to self-enlightenment, and not a mere negative escape from the uncertainties of life. It is, in fact, the superlative means of awakening the spiritual tendencies of man, so that he obtains two advantages: absolute freedom from vicious tendencies, and the super- normal power of spiritual wisdom. With the steady increase of concentration during Samàdhi meditation the mind becomes free from lower impulses and sensory emotions, and thus, by overcoming hindrances, achieves negative goodness.

The Venerable saluted the Buddha and said, “Venerable, as today I gazed upon the radiance of all these bodies, the radiance of your body alone satisfi ed me; for your body far outshone the radiance of all these other bodies.” Said the Buddha to the Venerable, “ânanda, the sun shines by day, the moon by night, the king when he is adorned, the arahat when he has left human associations behind and is absorbed in trance.

In His day, religious systems were many and varied. Of the contemporary religious sects, one of the most intriguing was the system created by Nighanñhanàthaputta. The life-story of Nighanñhanàthaputta is very similar to that of the Buddha. Although these two great Teachers were contemporaries, wandering and preaching in the same region, nowhere is it recorded that they met each other. Nighanñhanàthaputta preached in the Ardha Màgadhi language while the Buddha did so in Suddha Màgadhi (pure Màgadhi ). In later times among the Jain there was a division into two sects: (1) Svetàmbara Jaina (the white-clad sect) and (2) Dãghàmbara Jaina (the nude sect). Nighanñhanàthaputta was not a believer in creation ( anishvaravàdi ). Never referring to the theory of Ishñhàpurthi (creator) as given in the Vàdas, he was a fi rm believer in kamma and its consequences. Regarding this doctrine, there is recorded in the Sàma¤¤aphala Sutta , in the Buddhist canon, the Cetanà Saüvara , and similarly in the Upàli Sutta there is mentioned the Tr i d a n ó a .

As in Buddhism with its concept of cetanà (will or volition). Jainism believed in kamma and its consequences. The people, to a very great extent, accepted this teaching. The Buddha had to lay down the Sikkhàpada ( Vinaya rules) because of the infl uence of Jainism. More specifi cally, the Vinaya rules regarding the rainy season were laid down by the Buddha owing to Jainism. From this it is evi- dent that during that period Jainism was highly esteemed socially. According to the Jaina teaching even plants had a soul. Those who wear even a thread show an attachment to worldly comforts. All ani- mate and inanimate things possess a soul. Hence, owing to this belief Jains cover their mouth with a piece of cloth even when they go on a journey. The soul, according to Jainism, is of three kinds: (1) nityasiddhàñmaya (this is similar to the paramàñma of the Hindus); (2) muktàtmaya (this is similar to the âsava of the Buddhists); (3) baddhàtmaya (this is similar to the kamma of the Buddhists). This baddhàtmaya is said to pervade the cells of an individual’s body as long as the soul is steeped in kamma. One cannot secure release from saüsàra . It is only by self-mortifi cation that one can rid oneself of kamma. This teaching is not at all in accord with Buddhism, which explains kamma in a very different way.

The story goes that once upon a time several men gath- ered together at a certain place and rehearsed the noble qualities of the Venerable, saying, “Oh, our noble master is endowed with patience to such a degree that even when men abuse him and strike him, he never gets the least bit angry!” Thereupon a certain bràhmin who held false views asked, “Who is this that never gets angry?” “Our Venerable.” “It must be that nobody ever provoked him to anger.” “That is not the case, bràhmin.” “Well then, I will provoke him to anger.” “Provoke him to anger if you can!” “Trust me!” said the bràh- min; “I know just what to do to him.” Just then the Venerable entered the city for alms. When the bràhmin saw him, he stepped up behind him and struck him a tremendous blow with his fi st in the back. “What was that?” said the Venerable, and without so much as turning around to took, continued on his way. The fi re of remorse sprang up within every part of the bràhmin’s body. “Oh, how noble are the qualities with which the Venerable is endowed!” exclaimed the bràhmin. And prostrating himself at the Ven- erable’s feet, he said, “Pardon me, Venerable.” “What do you mean?” asked the Venerable. “I wanted to try your patience and struck you.” “Very well, I pardon you.” “If, Venerable, you"},{"pageNumber":1532,"pageContent":"1532 are willing to pardon me, hereafter sit and receive your food only in my house.” So saying, the bràhmin took the Venera- ble’s bowl, the Venerable yielding it willingly, and conducting him to his house, served him with food.

As the Venerable rose from his seat to go, he placed his bowl in the hand of the bràhmin. When the bystanders saw the bràhmin going out with the Venerable, they said, “Venerable, order this bràhmin who has taken your bowl to turn back.” “What do you mean, lay disci- ples?” “That bràhmin struck you and we are going to do for him after his deserts.” “What do you mean? Did he strike you or me?” “You, Venerable.” “If he struck me, he begged my pardon; go your way.” So saying, he dismissed the bystanders, and permitting the bràhmin to turn back, the Venerable went back again to the monastery. The monks were highly offended. ‘What sort of thing is this!” they exclaimed; “a bràhmin struck the Venerable Sàriputta a blow, and the Venerable straightaway went back to the house of the very bràhmin who struck him and accepted food at his hands! From the moment he struck the Venerable, for whom will he any longer have any respect?” He will go about pounding everybody right and left.” At that moment the Buddha drew near. “Monks,” said He, “what is the subject that engages your attention now as you sit here all gathered together?” “This was the subject we were discussing.” Said"},{"pageNumber":1533,"pageContent":"1533 the Buddha, “Monks, no bràhmin ever strikes another bràh- min; it must have been a householder-bràhmin who struck a monk-bràhmin; for when a man attains the fruit of the third path, all anger is utterly destroyed in him.” Explanatory Translation (Verse 389) bràhmaõassa na pahareyya bràhmaõo assa na mu¤cetha bràhmaõassa hantàraü dhã yassa mu¤cati tato dhã bràhmaõassa : a bràhmaõa; na pahareyya : do not attack; assa : towards the one who attacks him; na mu¤cetha : should not have hatred; bràhmaõassa hantàraü dhã : I condemn him who attacks a bràhmin; yassa mu¤cati : he who gets angry; tato dhã : the more I condemn No one should strike a bràhmaõa – the pure saint.

Commentary hiüsamàno nivattati : intent to harm ceases. These stanzas are prima- rily concerned with the need to be compassionate, even to those who adopt an aggressive attitude to one. In the Buddhist system four noble virtues are advocated to counter aggressive behaviour. These four vir- tues are described as Brahma Vihàra . This could be rendered as Sublime Attitudes. These four attitudes are loving-kindness ( mettà ), compassion ( karunà ), appreciative joy ( mudità ) and equanimity ( upekkhà ). All these four virtues curb aggressive, unfriendly behaviour and on the positive side promote non-violence, affection, kindness, compassion and sym- pathy. Of these four, loving-kindness ( mettà ) is fi rst. The second virtue that sublimates man is compassion ( karunà ). It is defi ned as that which makes the hearts of the good quiver when others are subject to suffering, or that which dissipates the sufferings of others. Its chief characteristic is the wish to remove the woes of others. The hearts of compassionate persons are even softer than fl ow- ers. They do not and cannot rest satisfi ed until they relieve the suffer- ings of others. At times, they even go to the extent of sacrifi cing their lives so as to alleviate the sufferings of others. The story of the Vyàghri Jàtaka where the Bodhisatta sacrifi ced his life to save a starving tigress and her cubs may be cited as an example. It is compassion that compels one to serve others with altruistic motives. A truly compassionate person lives not for himself but for"},{"pageNumber":1536,"pageContent":"1536 others. He seeks opportunities to serve others expecting nothing in return, not even gratitude. Many amidst us deserve our compassion. The poor and the needy, the sick and the helpless, the lonely and the destitute, the ignorant and the vicious, the impure and the undisciplined are some that demand the compassion of kind-hearted, noble-minded men and women, to whatever religion or to whatever race they belong. Some countries are materially rich but spiritually poor, while some others spiritually rich but materially poor. Both of these pathetic conditions have to be taken into consideration by the materially rich and the spiritually rich. It is the paramount duty of the wealthy to come to the succor of the poor, who unfortunately lack most of the necessities of life. Surely those who have in abundance can give to the poor and the needy their surplus without inconveniencing themselves. Once, a young student removed the door curtain in his house and gave it to a poor person telling his good mother that the door does not feel the cold but the poor certainly do. Such a kind-hearted attitude in young men and women is highly commendable. It is gratifying to note that some wealthy countries have formed themselves into various philanthropic bodies to help under-developed countries, especially in Jambudãpa, in every possible way. Charitable organizations have also been established in all countries by men, women and students to give every possible assist- ance to the poor and the needy. Religious bodies also perform their respective duties in this connection in their own humble way. Homes for the aged, orphanages and other similar charitable institutions are needed in under-developed countries. As the materially rich should have compassion on the materi- ally poor and try to elevate them, it is the duty of the spiritually rich, too, to have compassion on the spiritually poor and sublimate them, though they may be materially rich. Wealth alone cannot give genu- ine happiness. Peace of mind can be gained not by material treasures"},{"pageNumber":1537,"pageContent":"1537 but by spiritual treasures. Many in this world are badly in need of substantial spiritual food, which is not easily obtained, as the spiritu- ally poor far exceed the materially poor numerically, as they are found both amongst the rich and the poor. There are causes for these two kinds of diseases. Compassion- ate men and women must try to remove the causes if they wish to produce an effective cure. Effective measures have been employed by various nations to prevent and cure diseases not only of mankind but also of animals. The Buddha set a noble example by attending on the sick Him- self and exhorting His disciples with the memorable words: “He who ministers unto the sick ministers unto me.” Some selfl ess doctors render free services towards the alleviation of suffering. Some expend their whole time and energy in ministering to the poor patients even at the risk of their lives. Hospitals and free dispensaries have become a blessing to humanity but more are needed so that the poor may benefi t by them. In under-developed countries the poor suffer through lack of medical facilities. The sick have to be carried for miles with great inconvenience to the nearest hospital or dispensary for medical treatment. Sometimes, they die on the way. Pregnant mothers suffer most. Hospitals, dispensaries, maternity homes, etc., are essential needs in backward village areas. The lowly and the destitute deserve the compassion of wealthy men and women. Sometimes, servants and workers are not well paid, well fed or well clothed and, more often than not, they are ill-treated. Justice is not meted out to them. They are neglected and are powerless as there is nobody to plead for them. Glaring cases of inhuman cruelty receive publicity in some exceptional cases. Many such cases are not known. These unfortunate ones have no other alternative but to suffer meekly even as the Earth suffers in silence. The Buddha’s advocacy of com- passion has tremendous validity in our own times."},{"pageNumber":1538,"pageContent":"391.

And going to the Buddha, they reported the matter to him. The Buddha listened to what they had to say and then replied, “I myself conferred the eight cardinal precepts on Mahàpajàpatã Gotamã.

Commentary Mahàpajàpatã Gotamã : The present stanza was occasioned by a discus- sion that pivoted round Nun Mahàpajàpatã Gotamã. Mahàpajàpatã Gotamã was the youngest sister of King Suppabuddha. Her elder sister was Queen Màha Màyà. Both were married to King Suddhodana. She had a daugh- ter named Nandà and a son named Nanda. Later, both of them entered the Sangha. When Mahà Màyà died she adopted her sister’s son, Prince Siddhattha, entrusting her own son Nanda to the charge of nurses. Her family name was Gotami, and she was named Mahàpajàpatã because soothsayers predicted that she would be the head of a large following. When the Buddha visited the palace and preached the Dhammapàla Jàtaka to His father she attained the fi rst stage of sainthood. After the death of King Suddhodana, as both Princes Siddhàrtha and Nanda had renounced the world, she also decided to enter the noble Sangha and lead the Holy Life. When the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu to settle a dispute between the Sàkyas and Koliyas with regard to the irrigation of channels from the river Rohini, and was residing at the Nigrodha park, Mahàpajàpatã Gotamã approached the Buddha and, begging Him to grant permission for women to enter the Sangha, pleaded thus: “It would be well, Lord, if women should be allowed to renounce their homes and enter the home-"},{"pageNumber":1541,"pageContent":"1541 less state under the doctrine and discipline proclaimed by the Buddha.” Without stating His reasons, the Buddha straightaway refused, saying: “Enough, O’ Gotamã, let it not please you that women should be allowed to do so.” For the second and third time, Mahàpajàpatã Gotamã repeated her request, and the Buddha gave the same reply. Later, the Buddha, having stayed at Kapilavatthu as long as He liked, journeyed to Vesàli, and arriv- ing there in due course, resided at the Mahàvana in the Kåñàgàra Hall. Resolute Pajàpati Gotamã, without being discouraged by her disap- pointment, got her hair cut off, donned yellow garments, and surrounded by a great number of Sàkya ladies, walked from Kapilavatthu to Vesàli, a distance of about 150 miles, experiencing many a hardship. With swollen feet, her body covered with dust, she arrived at Vesàli and stood outside the porch of the Pinnacled Hall. Venerable ânanda found her weeping and, learning the cause of her grief, approached the Buddha and said, “Behold, Lord, Mahàpajàpatã Gotamã is standing outside the porch, with swollen feet, body covered with dust, and sad. Please permit women to renounce home and enter the homeless state under the doctrine and dis- cipline proclaimed by the Buddha. It were well, Lord, if women should be allowed to renounce their homes and enter the homeless state.” “Enough, ânanda, let it not please you that women should be allowed to do so!” was the Buddha’s reply. For the second and third time, he interceded on their behalf, but the Buddha would not yield. So Venerable ânanda made a different approach and respectfully questioned the Buddha: “Are women, lord, capable of realizing the state of a stream-winner ( sotàpanna ), once-returner ( sakadàgàmi ) never-returner ( anàgàmi ) and an arahat, when they have gone forth from home to the homeless state under the doctrine and discipline proclaimed by the Buddha?” The Buddha replied that they were capable of realizing saint- ship. Encouraged by this favourable reply, Venerable ânanda appealed again, saying, “If then, Venerable, they are capable of attaining saintship, since Mahàpajàpatã Gotamã had been of great service to the Buddha, when as aunt and nurse she nourished Him and gave Him milk, and on the death of His mother suckled the Buddha at her own breast, it were well, Lord, that women should be given permission to renounce the world and enter the homeless state under the doctrine and discipline proclaimed by the Buddha.” “If, ânanda, Mahàpajàpatã Gotamã accepts the eight chief rules, let that be reckoned to her as the form of her ordination,” said the Buddha, fi nally yielding to the entreaties of Venerable ânanda."},{"pageNumber":1542,"pageContent":"392.

The fact is that he fi rst heard the Dhamma from the lips of Venerable Assajã, and that from the day when he attained the fruit of conversion, he has rever- enced his own teacher.

He had the unique distinc- tion of being the fi rst arahat to show the way to Upatissa the bràhmin afterwards to become the chief disciple as Venerable Sàriputta.

It simply means that the Buddha not only showed how a being came into existence but also how that existence could cease forever. If there is a craving there must be a ceasing thereof. To Upatissa it was like opening a door to a familiar room. Before the second line was quoted the truth fl ashed before his vision and he entered the stream of saintship. Soon, Upa- tissa became the chief disciple. His was a rare intellect only second to the Buddha’s. It was said that actuated by the noble quality of gratitude ever afterwards the chief disciple slept wherever possible with his head turned towards the direction of the place where Venerable Assajã, his teacher, was said to be sojourning.

Commentary na jaccà hoti Bràhmàno : one does not become a bràhmaõa merely by birth. This statement represents the Buddha’s revolutionary philosophy which disturbed the bràhmin-dominated upper crust of Indian society. The bràhmins of the day considered themselves the chosen of Brahma, and that by birth they deserved veneration by all others. Buddha dealt a blow to this entrenched concept. Society at that time was divided into four sections called varõas . It is clear that the Teachings of this great teacher denounced this varõa or caste system. Indian society of that time especially benefi tted from the doc- trines of the Buddha because it was the fi rst time that the rigid system of casteism was denounced. It would appear that the people of India, steeped in ignorance, received great consolation from this new doctrine of the Buddha. Owing to this important fact the great transcendental doctrine of the Buddha began to spread throughout all India. There is a great store of varied information contained in the Buddhist literature of the Tripitaka concerning the complex society of Jambudãpa during the 6th Century B.C., when the Buddha lived and when many philosophies were expounded. Founders of different religions and philosophies preached diverse ways of salvation to be followed by human beings. The intelligentsia engaged themselves in the search to discover which of these proclaimed the truth. The Buddhist system of thought provides an ethical realism in which the nature of the traditional social structure could be critically examined. Prior to the Buddha high spiritual pursuits were allowed only to privileged groups. But the Buddha opened the path of Enlightenment to all who had the potential to achieve spiritual liberation. Since this was an assault on the entrenched system, many a bràh- min was provoked into entering into arguments with the Buddha about who a real bràhmin was.

This bràhmin, so the story goes, used to climb a certain kakudha tree that grew close to the gate of the city of Vesàli, grasp a branch with his two feet, and swing himself from the branch, head downwards. And hanging thus, he would cry out, “Give me a hundred kapilas! Give me pennies! Give me a slave-woman! If you don’t give me what I ask for, I will let myself drop from this tree and kill myself and make this city as though it had never been a city!” As the Buddha, accompanied by the congregation of monks, entered the city, the monks saw this Bràhmin hang- ing from the tree, and when they departed from the city, still they saw him hanging there, just as he hung when they entered the city. The residents of the city thought to them- selves, “This fellow has been hanging thus from this tree ever since early morning; should he fall, he is likely to make this city as though it had never been a city.” And because of fear that their city might be destroyed, they complied with all of his demands and gave him all that he asked for. “We have given you all that you asked for,” said they.

Said the Buddha, “Monks, this is not the fi rst time this Bràhmin has been a trickster and a thief; he was a trickster and a thief in a previous state of existence also. But while in his present state of existence he deceives the simple-minded, in his previous state of existence he failed to confound the wise.” Complying with a request of the monks, the Buddha related the following story of the past about the false ascetic and the king of the lizards. Once upon a time a certain ascetic lodged near a certain village of farmers, and this ascetic was a hypocrite. Now there was a certain family that used to look after his needs: by day, of the food, whether hard or soft, they always gave a portion to the ascetic just as they did to their own children; and in the evening they would set aside a portion of the food prepared for their supper, and give it to him on the following day. Now not far from his leaf-hut, in a certain anthill, dwelt the king of the lizards, and it was the custom of the king of the lizards from time to time to call upon the ascetic and pay his respects to him. But on that particular day this ascetic said to himself, “I will kill that lizard,” and concealing a stick in a fold of his garments, he lay down quite near that ant-hill and pretended to be asleep.

The king of the lizards crawled into the ant-hill, and poking his head out and looking around, said to the ascetic, “All this time I vainly imagined you to be an ascetic, but when just now you threw your stick at me, desiring to kill me, at that moment you ceased to be an ascetic. What is the use of matted locks to a man like you, who utterly lacks wisdom? What is the use of your skin, all furnished with claws?

These rules are described as dhutaõga . Dhutaõga – means of shaking off (the defi lements), means of purifi cation, ascetic, or aus- tere practices. These are strict observances recommended by the Buddha to monks, as a help to cultivate contentedness, renunciation, energy and the like.

The monk training himself in morality should take upon himself the means of purifi cation, in order to gain those virtues through which the purity of morality will become accomplished, to wit: fewness of needs, contented- ness, austerity, detachment, energy, moderation, etc. The thirteen dhutaõgas consist in the vows of: (1) wearing patched-up robes; (2) wearing only three robes; (3) going for alms; (4) not omitting any house whilst going for alms; (5) eating at one sitting; (6) eating only from the alms bowl; (7) refusing all further food; (8) living in the forest; (9) living under the tree; (10) living in the open air; (11) living in the cemetery; (12) bei ng sat isfi ed with whatever dwelling; (13) sleeping in sitting position (and never lying down).

He asked for the empty measure and erected a Ståpa over it.

In teaching and for wisdom he was second only to the Buddha. Often he was prevailed upon to preach whenever the Blessed One required rest. Once, a bràhmin gave him a severe blow to test his capacity for patience. He was unmoved. Then the bràhmin asked for forgiveness which was readily given. Thereafter the bràhmin wished him to partake the midday meal, which offer was also readily accepted. Could such conduct be equalled save by the Blessed One Himself? His attitude to a seven-year-old sàmanera is most touching. It speaks volumes for his modesty. Once he was going about with a corner of his under-garment trailing contrary to Vinaya rules. The sàmanera pointed this out to him. He promptly thanked him in salu- tation and put the matter right. He had a special regard for Ràhula and his mother Ràhulamàtà. When the latter was suffering from fl atulence, he was responsible for getting a particular mango juice to serve as a medicine. When she was suffering from some stomach ail- ment he obtained from king Pasenadi some rice mixed with ghee and fl avoured with red fi sh to serve as a cure. When Anàthapiõóika the treasurer lay dying, he visited him with ânanda and preached to him the sermon called Anàthapinóiko- vàda Sutta . He was named after his mother, Sàri the Brahamin lady. It was written that the two Chief Disciples should predecease the Buddha. Following custom Sàriputta went to his mother’s residence at Nàlagà- maka (Nalanda) after paying obeisance to the Buddha. It was on this occasion he is said to have remarked that his mortal eyes would never behold the august feet of his Master again. Samsaric existence was over. At the sick bed, his brother Cunda Samanuddesa attended on him.

The story has been related at length in the Commen- tary on the Stanza beginning with the words, ‘As sweet as honey thinks a fool an evil deed.’ For it is there said: Some time later, the throng in the hall of truth began the following discussion: “To be sure those that have rid themselves of the Depravities gratify their passions. Why should they not? For they are not Kolapa-trees or ant-hills, but are living creatures with bodies of moist fl esh. Therefore they also like the pleasures of love.” At that moment the Buddha drew near. “Monks,” He inquired, “what is the subject that engages your attention now as you sit here all gathered together?” “Such and such,” was the reply. Said the Buddha, “No, monks, they that have rid themselves of the depravities neither like the pleasures of love nor gratify their passions. For even as a drop of water which has fallen upon a lotus-leaf does not cling thereto or remain thereon, but rolls over and falls off, even as a grain of mustard-seed does not cling to the point of a needle or remain thereon, but rolls over and falls off, precisely so two-fold love clings not to the heart of one that has rid himself of the depravities or remains there.” And join- ing the connection, He preached the Dhamma with a stanza.

When she came of age, proposals for marriage came from all quar- ters and the harassed father did not wish to offend any suitor by a refusal. To the father, ordination in the noble Sangha was the only solution. The daughter, true to her destiny, agreed. Upon being ordained she was kept in charge of the convocation room where the nuns assembled for the confession of lapses. She had to tend the lamps. She observed that the light was sustained by the wick and the oil. Sometimes, the light goes out by going short of either or by a gust of wind. So life was due to kammic force. This kept her thinking till she became an arahat. She remembered her former lives. It was while living alone in a forest, a young shepherd named Nanda, a kinsman of hers, got infatuated with her and committed a sexual offence as soon as she returned from a round of alms. Coming from the noon day glare to the dark cave where her abode was, she could not see and hence, she was taken by surprise despite her protests. He committed the dire deed and was immediately born in the hell ( niraya ) when the earth yawned and swallowed the foolish young man. He was, however, dead before the yawning of the earth. It was after this incident the Blessed One prohibited the female dis- ciples of the noble Sangha from living in isolation in the forest. Not long afterwards, the Buddha, addressing the monks, declared Uppala Vaõõà Mahà Theri was foremost for psychic power as Venerable Mahà Moggallàna was among the Mahà arahats."},{"pageNumber":1576,"pageContent":"402.

That day the Buddha, on His round for alms, came to the same road, and saw Puõõa with a pot in her hand. She offered the Buddha her rice cake which the Buddha readily accepted. She was wonder- ing whether the Buddha would throw it away and take His meal in a palace or a millionaire’s house. But the Buddha sat there itself by the roadside on a mat laid by the Venerable ânanda, and partook of the rice cake for His breakfast. The Buddha explained to her that the monks were awake at night on their religious duties, and preached to her the doctrine. At the end of the preaching, Puõõa realized the fruit of sotàpatti .

Commentary The story of Khemà : Khemà was born in a princely family at Sàgala by the name of Khemà. The colour of her complexion was that of gold. She was beautiful. She married King Bimbisàra of Kosala. She was reluctant, however, to visit the Buddha, for fear that the Blessed One would moralise on the fl eeting nature of beauty. Every time she visited the temple she dodged the Buddha. One day the king got his men to take her willy-nilly to the Buddha. On her arrival, the Buddha created a phantom of unsurpassing beauty to attend on Him. Khemà was struck by her beauty. While she was thus engaged she felt that beauty could only beguile. The Buddha made the fi gure to go through youth middle age, old age and thereafter to extreme old age devoid of every- thing worthwhile. Beauty thus gave way to hideousness. It was a graphic picture. Khemà understood the meaning and felt what was in store for her. Anicca , dukkha and anatta : in other words, transiency and sorrow – without any lasting entity called a soul. To a mind thus prepared the Buddha preached. The seeds fell on good ground. She entered the stream of sainthood ( sotàpanna ). The Buddha illustrated His sermon by bringing before her mind the lesson of the spider and the web. As soon as a fl y strikes a web, the spider by the motion thus generated takes it as a signal and attacks and devours the fl y. T h i s g o e s on. The spider becomes wedded to the web. So are human beings wedded to passion and lust. Her mind saw all. She became an arahat. She asked permission from the king for her ordination. The king, himself a budding saint, readily consented. One day god Màra, in the guise of a young man, tempted Khemà. The man met with a rebuff. His discomfi ture was com- plete. He took to fl ight. One night Khemà thought of visiting the Buddha. But the Buddha was with Sakka, king of the deities. Rather than disturb the Buddha, Khemà wheeled round in the air and disappeared. Sakka, on seeing the vision, was soon enlightened on the matter by the Buddha.

Monk Tissa, after taking a subject of meditation, went to a mountainside. There he found a cave which suited him and he spent the three months of the rainy season in that cave. He went to the village for alms-food every morning. In the village, there was a certain elderly woman who regularly offered him alms-food. In the cave there also lived a guardian spirit. As Tissa was one whose practice of morality was pure, she found it diffi cult to remain in the same cave, as he was a noble monk. At the same time, she did not have the courage to ask him to leave the place. So she thought of a plan that would enable her to fi nd fault with the monk and thus cause him to leave the cave. The spirit decided to possess the youngest son of the woman to whose house Tissa usually went for his alms-food. She caused the boy to behave in a peculiar way, turning his head backwards, and rolling his wide open eyes. When the woman saw what had happened, she screamed and the spirit said, “I have possessed your son. Let your monk wash his feet with water and sprinkle that water on the head of your son. Only then will I release your son.” The next day, when the monk came to her house for alms-food, she did what was demanded by the spirit and the boy was left in peace.

When Tissa returned, she revealed herself and said, “I am the spirit guarding this cave, O’ you exorcist, don’t enter this cave.” The monk knew that he had lived a virtuous life from the day he had become a monk, so he replied that he had not broken the precept of abstaining from practicing exorcism or witchcraft. Then she accused Tissa of having treated the young boy possessed by a spirit at the house of the elderly woman. But the monk refl ected that he had not practiced exorcism and realised that even the spirit could fi nd no fault with him. That gave him a delightful satisfaction and happi- ness; he attained arahathood while standing at the entrance to the cave. Since Tissa had now become an arahat, he told the spirit that she had wrongly accused a monk like him, whose virtue was pure and spotless, and also advised her not to cause fur- ther disturbances. Tissa continued to stay in the cave till the end of the vassa , and then he returned to the Jetavana Monas- tery. When he told the other monks about his encounter with the spirit, they asked him whether he had been angry with the spirit when he was forbidden to enter the cave. He answered in the negative. The other monks asked the Buddha, “Venerable Tissa claims he has no more anger. Is it true?” The Buddha replied, “Monks, Tissa is speaking the truth. He has indeed become an arahat; he is no longer attached to anyone; he has no reason to get angry with anyone.” Explanatory Translation (Verse 404) gahaññhehi anàgàrehi ca åbhayaü asaüsaññhaü ànokasàriü appicchaü taü ahaü bràhmanaü bråmi"},{"pageNumber":1586,"pageContent":"1586 gahaññhehi : with laymen; anàgàrehi : with those who have renounced the world; ca åbhayaü : with both these groups of people; asaüsaññhaü : establishing no contact; ànokasàriü : not given to ways of craving; appicchaü : contented with little; taü : him; ahaü : I; bràhmanaü bråmi : call a bràhamaõa.

It appears that this monk, upon receiving a meditation topic from the Buddha, retired to the forest, applied himself diligently to the practice of meditation, and attained arahatship.

Then said the bràhmin’s wife to her husband, “These Venera- bles do not wish to eat; go to the bràhmin’s pale and bring back with you a single old bràhmin.” Sakka, disguising him- self as an old bràhmin worn out by old age, went to the bràh- min’s pale and sat down in the most conspicuous seat of the bràhmins. When the bràhmin saw him, he thought to himself, “Now my wife will be delighted,” and saying, “Come, let us go home,” he took him and went back home with him. When the bràhmin’s wife saw him, her heart was fi lled with delight. She took the rugs and mats which were spread over two seats, spread them over one, and said to him, “Noble Sir, sit here.” When Sakka entered the house, he saluted the four novices with the fi ve rests, and fi nding a place for himself at the edge of the seats where the novices were sitting, sat down cross- legged on the ground. When the bràhmin’s wife saw him, she said to the bràhmin, “To be sure you have brought a bràhmin, you have brought back with you one old enough to be your father. He is going about saluting novices young enough to be his grandsons. What use have we for him?

Then the bràh- min’s wife said to her husband, “Come, bràhmin, you take hold of one arm and I will take hold of the other.” So the bràh- min and his wife both took hold of his two arms, belabored him about the back, and dragged him through the door out of the house.

Commentary The story of the two brother monks : Mahà Panthaka (Big Road) and Culla Panthaka (Small Road). Cullapanthaka was associated with his elder brother who is called Mahà Panthaka. As both were born on the road they were called Panthaka. Culla Panthaka was distinguished from all the mahà arahats by the power to form any number of corpo- real fi gures by psychic power and also by his ability to practice mystic meditation in the world of form. They were the offspring of a daughter of a treasurer entering into a clandestine marriage with a servant of her father’s household. This explains the birth of the fi rst child while the expectant mother was on the way to meet her parents with her paramour. They both returned home as the child was born on the road. This was repeated in the case of the second child too. The elder child desired to enter the noble Sangha. He got the younger brother to follow him. But the younger brother paid no heed to reciting. Venerable brother though a mahà arahat having to play the teacher to his younger brother nearly ended badly. Culla Panthaka was asked to memorise a verse of four lines but he was unable to do so for four months with the result the elder brother felt that he was of no use to the dispensation.

He gave him a piece of linen of spotless white and asked him to stroke it facing the sun saying that noth- ing is so clean that doesn’t turn impure. The words were Rajoharanam. In due course, perspiration from the palm of his hand made the cloth exceedingly dirty. The universality of change ( anicca ) which is the key note of the doctrine of Buddhism was grasped. So Culla Panthaka became an arahat. At the same time, the latent power was manifested. He got the psychic power to create any number of corporeal fi gures which was soon put to a practical test. The almsgiving came to pass. Buddha promptly put His hand over the bowl, when food was offered. The reason was that Culla Panthaka, who was left out, should participate. So an attendant was sent to the temple, that was close by, to fetch him. He was amazed to see in the temple over a thousand monks all look- ing alike. So it was duly reported to Jãvaka who redirected him to say that Culla Panthaka was expected. On the second visit the wonder grew. For as soon as the name of Culla Panthaka was mentioned all the monks began saying “I am Culla Panthaka”. In the meanwhile the alms-giving was held up by the rapidly developing situation. So the attendant was asked by Jãvaka as directed by the Buddha to go again and this time to catch hold of the robe of the fi rst monk nearest to him saying that the Buddha wants Culla Panthaka. When this was done, the temple appeared deserted except for the monk whose robe he was holding. So the younger brother took his due place in the almsgiving.

It seems that this elder monk was in the habit of accost- ing both laymen and monks with the epithet commonly applied only to outcasts. “Come, vile fellow!

Commentary Story of Piliõdavaccha : Piliõdavaccha was born a bràhmin at Sràvasti. Having listened to a sermon of the Buddha he was instantly converted. He sought ordination. He had a habit of addressing all and sundry both in the Sangha and in the Laity by the term vasala signifying a person of low caste. He had acquired this habit during fi ve hundred lives when he was born a bràhmin, for bràhmins regarded all others as below them. Piliõda- vaccha could not get rid of this lapse by force of habit. It is said habit is second nature. In a person who had got rid of all defi lements, still the habit acquired during a long period persisted. The Buddha was the sole exception.

Knowing not who Venerable Piliõdavaccha was, he was taking a wagon load of tippili for sale, having a sample of specimen tippili in a basket. When he met one morning the Mahà arahat at the gate of Jetàwanàrama proceeding on a journey, as usual, mahà arahat addressed the seller as vasala and inquired what the basket contained. The seller was dumb founded. He retorted by saying excreta of mice. “Be it so”, said the Mahà arahat and went on his way. There was a striking similarity between long pepper and excreta of mice and the seller to his horror discovered that the specimen and then the wagon in turn consisted no longer of long pepper but excreta of mice. The deities saw to it that the goods were turned into excreta of mice, even though it caused distress to the trader. The trader’s stock had sunk to zero. The poor man’s grief knew no bounds. In despera- tion he sought the Thera to give vent to his anger for he felt convinced that he was the cause. He met a well meaning person who questioned him. On hearing the story, he explained to the trader that Venerable Piliõdavaccha was a Mahà arahat and the remedy lay in his own hands. He was asked to meet the Mahà Thera again in the same way as in the fateful morning and when addressed, in the usual way, to be careful to reply simply that they were tippili. Then the Venerable Piliõdavaccha would say, “Be it so”. Then you would discover the true nature of your goods. The seller did so and was glad to retrieve his fortune, for instantly the goods of the trader were in the original state by the same process.

Commentary bràhmins : The Enlightened One and His disciples had extensive encounters with bràhmins of various types. The story that gives rise to the present stanza is such an encounter. But, there are more profound philosophic encounters between the Buddha and the bràhmins. Here is one such: Bràhmanic orthodoxy intolerantly insisted on believing and accepting their tradition and authority as the only truth without question. Once a group of learned and well-known bràhmins went to see the Buddha and had a long discussion with him. One of the group, a bràhmin youth of sixteen years of age, named Kàpañhika, considered by them all to be an exceptionally brilliant mind, put a question to the Buddha: “Venerable Gotama, there are the ancient holy scriptures of the bràhmins handed down along the line by unbroken oral tradition of texts. With regard to them, bràhmins come to the"},{"pageNumber":1605,"pageContent":"1605 absolute conclusion: ‘This alone is Truth, and everything else is false’. Now, what does the Buddha say about this?” The Buddha inquired: “Among bràhmins is there any one single bràhmin who claims that he personally knows and sees that ‘This alone is truth, and everything else is false.’ ?” The young man was frank, and said, “No.” “Then, is there any one single teacher, or a teacher of teachers of bràhmins back to the seventh generation, or even any one of those original authors of those scriptures, who claims that he knows and he sees: ‘This alone is truth, and everything else is false’?” “No.” “Then, it is like a line of blind men, each holding on to the pre- ceding one; the fi rst one does not see, the middle one also does not see, the last one also does not see. Thus, it seems to me that the state of the bràhmins is like that of a line of blind men.” Then the Buddha gave advice of extreme importance to the group of bràhmins: “It is not proper for a wise man who maintains (lit. protects) truth to come to the conclusion: ‘This alone is truth, and everything else is false.’” Asked by the young bràhmin to explain the idea of maintain- ing or protecting truth, the Buddha said: “A man has a faith. If he says ‘This is my faith,’ so far he maintains truth. But by that he cannot proceed to the absolute conclusion: ‘This alone is truth, and every- thing else is false.’ In other words, a man may believe what he likes, and he may say ‘I believe this’. So far he respects truth. But because of his belief or faith, he should not say that what he believes is alone the truth, and everything else is false.”"},{"pageNumber":1606,"pageContent":"410. âsà yassa na vijjanti asmiü loke paramhi ca niràsayaü visaüyuttaü tamahaü bråmi bràhmaõaü.

But even after the Venerable had celebrated the terminal festival, not all of the requisites had as yet arrived. So when he set out to go to the Buddha he said to the monks, “When the people bring the requisites for the young monks and novices, pray take them and send them on; should they not bring them, be good enough to send me word.” So saying, he went to the Buddha. The monks immediately began to discuss the matter, saying, “Judging by what Venerable Sàriputta said today, Craving still persists within him. For when he went back, he said to the monks with reference to the requisites for residence given to his own fellow residents, ‘Pray send them on; other- wise be good enough to send me word.’” Just then the Buddha drew near. “Monks,” said he, “what is the subject that engages your attention now as you sit here all gathered together?” “Such and such,” was the reply.

It is this thirst, desire, greed, craving, manifesting itself in vari- ous ways, that gives rise to all forms of suffering and the continuity of beings. But it should not be taken as the fi rst cause, for there is no fi rst cause possible as, according to Buddhism, everything is relative and inter-dependent. Even this thirst, taõhà , which is considered as the cause or origin of dukkha , depends for its arising ( samudaya ) on some- thing else, which is sensation ( vedanà ), and sensation arises depending on contact ( phassa ), and so on and so forth, goes on the circle which is known as conditioned genesis ( pañicca-samuppàda ), which we will discuss later."},{"pageNumber":1609,"pageContent":"1609 So taõhà , thirst, is not the fi rst or the only cause of the arising of dukkha . But it is the most palpable and immediate cause, the princi- pal thing and the all-pervading thing.

Within the necessarily limited space of our discussion, it will be suffi cient if we remember that this thirst has, as its centre, the false idea of self arising out of ignorance. Here the term thirst includes not only desire for, and attach- ment to, sense-pleasures, wealth and power, but also desire for, and attachment to, ideas and ideals, views, opinions, theories, conceptions and beliefs ( dhamma-taõhà ). According to the Buddha’s analysis, all the troubles and strife in the world, from little personal quarrels in families to great wars between nations and countries, arise out of this selfi sh thirst. From this point of view, all economic, political and social problems are rooted in this selfi sh thirst. Great statesmen who try to settle international disputes and talk of war and peace only in economic and political terms touch the superfi cialities, and never go deep into the real root of the problem.

Once, a king of cobras called Nandopananda, also noted for psychic feats, was threatening all beings of the Himàlayas that should happen to pass that way. The Buddha was besieged with offers from various members of the noble Sangha to subdue the snake king. At last, Venerable Mahà Moggallàna’s turn came and the Buddha readily assented. He knew the monk was equal to the task. The result was a Himàlayan encounter when the nàga king, having been worsted in the combat, sued for peace. The Buddha was present throughout and cautioned Moggallàna. The epic feat was succinctly commemorated in the seventh verse of the Jayamangala Gàtha which is recited at almost every Buddhist occasion. Whether in shaking the marble palace of Sakka the heavenly ruler, by his great toe or visiting hell, he was equally at ease. These vis- its enabled him to collect all sorts of information. He could graphically narrate to dwellers of this Earth the fate of their erstwhile friends or rela- tives; how, by evil kamma, some get an ignominious re-birth in hell and others, by good kamma, an auspicious re-birth in one of the six heavens. These ministrations brought great kudos to the Dispensation, much to the chagrin of other sects. His life is an example and a grim warning. Even a chief disciple, capable of such heroic feats, was not immune from the residue of evil kamma, though sown in the very remote past. In the last life of Moggallàna, he could not escape the relentless force of k a m ma. For, wit h a n ara hat ’s parinirvàna , good or bad effects of kamma come to an end. He was trapped twice by robbers but he made good his escape. But on the third occasion, he saw, with his divine eye, the futility of escape. He was mercilessly beaten so much so that his body could be put even in a sack. But death must await his destiny.

A son was born in the household of a wealthy householder in Ràjagaha. From the circle of his navel proceeded forth a light like that of the moon’s disk, and therefore they gave him the name Moonlight, Candàbha. The bràhmans thought to themselves, “If we take him with us, we can make the whole world our prey.” Accordingly they seated him in a carriage and took him about with them. And to everyone they met they said, “Whosoever shall stroke the body of this Bràhman with his hand, such-and-such power and glory shall he receive.” People would give a hun- dred pieces of money, or a thousand pieces of money, and thus receive the privilege of stroking the body of the Bràhman with their hand. Travelling thus from place to place, they fi nally came to Sàvatthi and took lodgings between the city and the monastery. Now at Sàvatthi fi ve billion of noble disciples gave alms before breakfast; and after breakfast, bearing in their hands perfumes, garlands, garments, and medicaments, went to hear the Dhamma. When the Bràhmans saw them, they asked them, “Where are you going?” “To the Buddha to hear the Dhamma.” “Come! What will you gain by going there? There is no super- natural power like the supernatural power possessed by our Bràhman Moonlight: they that but stroke his body, receive such and such power and glory; come have a look at him.”"},{"pageNumber":1618,"pageContent":"1618 “What does the supernatural power of your Bràhman amount to?

Finally, the Bràhmans said, “Let us go to the monastery and fi nd out whether it is our Moonlight or your Teacher that possesses the greater supernatural power.” And taking him with them, they set out for the monastery. The Buddha, even as Moonlight approached Him, caused the special radiance to disappear. The result was that when Moonlight stood in the presence of the Buddha, he resembled nothing so much as a crow in a basket of charcoal. The bràhmans took him to one side, and immediately the brightness reappeared, bright as ever. Again they brought him into the presence of the Buddha, and straightaway the brightness disappeared, just as it had the fi rst time. When Moonlight went for the third time into the presence of the Buddha and observed that the brightness disappeared, he thought to himself, “Without a doubt this man knows a charm by which he can make this brightness disappear.” So he asked the Buddha, “Is it not a fact that you know a charm by which you can make this brightness of mine disappear?” “Yes, I know such a charm.” ‘Well then, impart it to me.” “It cannot be imparted to one who has not retired from the world.” Thereupon Moonlight said to his fellow bràhmans, “As soon as I learn this charm, I shall be the foremost man in all the Land of the Rose-apple. You remain right here and I will retire from the world and in but a few days learn this charm.” So he asked the Buddha to admit him to the Sangha, retired from the world, and subsequently was admitted to full mem-"},{"pageNumber":1619,"pageContent":"1619 bership in the Sangha. The Buddha taught him a formula of meditation which consists of the thirty-two constituent parts of the body. “What is this?” asked Candàbha. “This is some- thing which you must repeat as a preliminary to acquiring this charm,” replied the Buddha. From time to time the bràhmans came to him and asked, “Have you learned the charm yet?” “Not yet, but I am learning it.” In but a few days he attained arahatship. When the bràh- mans came and asked him again, he made answer, “Depart ye! Now have I reached the state of one who will never return.” The monks reported the matter to the Buddha, saying, “Ven- erable, this bràhman says what is not true, utters falsehood.” Said the Buddha, “Monks, worldly joy has been extinguished for my son; he speaks the truth.” Explanatory Translation (Verse 413) candaü iva vimalaü suddhaü vippasannaü anàvilaü nandãbhavaparikkhãnaü tam ahaü bràhmaõaü bråmi candaü iva : like the moon; vimalaü : free of blemishes; suddhaü : pure; vippassannaü : exceptionally tranquil; anàvilaü : unagitated; nandãbhavaparikkhãnaü : who has given up the craving that takes delight in the cycle of existence; taü : him; ahaü : I; bràhmaõaü bråmi : describe as the bràhmaõa He is like moon at the full – spotless and free of blemishes.

He practiced the art of giving or dàna pàrami to the utmost limit. He became in due course the prince of receivers. Something notable in his career happened when he was born long ago in the dispensation of Vipassi Buddha. It was at this time the king and his people were vying with each other in the art of giving. There was a festival of giving alms to the Buddha and the Sangha. It was a matter of healthy and pleasant rivalry. When the turn of the people came, they ran short of milk and honey. This food would pave the way for success in the alms giving. They kept a man to watch at the city gates with suffi cient money. He came across a young man carrying what they needed. Buyer was anxious to buy. But the seller was not so enthusiastic. The result was bargaining with a vengeance. In the East bargaining is compared to barge-poling on the river. Bidding rose from a gold coin. The seller, on learning of the almsgiving, wanted to partake of the merit. On hearing that there was no impediment he further inquired whether there was any one among them who could offer one thousand gold coins. On hearing there wasn’t any, he said that the pot of curd and honey were even worth two thousand coins and that if permitted he was willing to give it free. The offer was accepted. We are told that by the power of the Buddha, the curd and honey were found suffi cient. On this occasion it was his aspiration that one day he would be the head of the recipients. Thereafter, he took his conception in the womb of Suppàvàsa, a daughter of the king of Koliya. Many were the windfalls that came to the lot of the family. The land became pro- ductive and the fi elds returned a record harvest. Whatever was given the receiver was amply satisfi ed. But both mother and son were not immune from demeritori- ous actions ( akusala kamma ) of the past. Had it been a lesser child the result would have been tragic. Faith ( saddhà ) worked marvels. In the Buddha, people had a sure guide and Kalyàna Mitta . Suppàvàsa naturally thought that she was at death’s door. For, at the end of the seventh year, she suffered terrible agony. She then implored her husband to invite The Buddha and the noble Sangha for an alms-giving. Upon being invited, the Blessed One saw that both mother and son would be saved. He accordingly gave His blessing and at that moment the child was born. Great was the rejoicing. The husband who left his gloomy home returned amidst scenes of mirth and joy. Hence the name of Sãvali was given to the son. Seven days alms- giving to the Buddha and the noble Sangha followed. Sãvali was thus a precocious lad. After seven days – he was nearly seven years old – at the parting of the fi rst lock of hair, he entered the fi rst stream of saintship and at the parting of the last lock, he had become a full-fl edged arahat. It was well known in the noble Sangha that Venerable Sãvali was foremost among recipients."},{"pageNumber":1624,"pageContent":"415.

At Sàvatthi, we are told, in a great household possessing forty billion of treasure, was reborn a certain youth of station named Ocean-of-Beauty, Sun- darasamudda Kumàra. One day after breakfast, seeing a great company of people with perfumes and garlands in their hands, going to Jetavana to hear the Dhamma, he asked, “Where are you going?” “To listen to the Buddha preach the Dhamma,” they replied. “I will go too,” said he, and accompanying them, sat down in the outer circle of the congregation. The Buddha’s discourse made him eager to retire from the world. Therefore, as the congregation departed he asked the Buddha to admit him to the Sangha. The Buddha said, “The Buddhas admit no one to the Sangha who has not fi rst obtained permission of his mother and father.” Having obtained their permission, he retired from the world and was admitted to the Sangha by the Buddha. Subsequently, he made his full profession as a mem- ber of the Sangha. Then he thought to himself. “What is the use of my living here?” So departing from Jetavana, he went to Ràjagaha and spent his time going his alms-rounds. Now one day there was a festival at Sàvatthi, and on that day Ocean-of-Beauty’s mother and father saw their son’s friends diverting themselves amid great splendor and mag- nifi cence.

He has left Sàvatthi and gone to Ràjagaha.” “Suppose I were to succeed in making him return to the world; what would you do for me?” “We would make you the mistress of all the wealth of this house- hold.” “Very well, give me my expenses.” Taking the amount of her expenses, she surrounded her- self with a large retinue and went to Ràjagaha. Taking note of the street in which the Venerable was accustomed to make his alms-round, she obtained a house in this street and took up her abode therein. And early in the morning she prepared choice food, and when the Venerable entered the street for alms, she gave him alms. After a few days had passed, she said to him, “Venerable, sit down here and eat your meal.” So saying, she offered to take his bowl, and the Venerable yielded his bowl willingly. Then she served him with choice food, and having so done, said to him, “Venerable, right here is the most delightful spot to which you could come on your round for alms.” For a few days she enticed him to sit on the veranda, and there provided him with choice food. That woman employed the devices of a woman, all the graces of a woman. The monk thought, “Alas, I have committed a grievous sin! I did not consider what I was doing.” And he was deeply moved.

But seeing his own refl ection and that of his retinue in the jeweled walls, he concluded, “The householder has armed himself for battle and has come forth with his host.” Therefore he did not dare approach the palace.

When, therefore, the Yakkha Yamakoli, who stood guard over the fi rst gate, saw Ajatàsattu Kumàra, he called out, “Where are you going?” And straightaway, putting Ajàtasattu Kumàra and his retinue to rout, he pursued them in all directions. The king sought refuge in the very same monastery as that to which the treasurer had gone.

This spiritual effort is referred to on padhàna : effort. The four right efforts ( saüma-ppadhàna ), forming the sixth stage of the eight-fold path ( saümà- vàyàma ) are: (1) the effort to Avoid ( saüvara-padhàna ), (2) to overcome ( pahàna ), (3) to develop ( bhàvanà ), (4) to maintain ( anurakkhaõa ): (i) the effort to avoid unwholesome ( akusala ) states, such as evil thoughts etc., (ii) to overcome unwholesome states, (iii) to develop wholesome ( kusala ) states, such as the seven elements of enlightenment ( bojjhaõga ), (iv) to maintain the wholesome states. The monk rouses his will to avoid the arising of evil, unwhole- some things not yet arisen... to overcome them... to develop wholesome things not yet arisen... to maintain them, and not to let them disap- pear, but to bring them to growth, to maturity and to the full perfec- tion of development. And he makes effort, stirs up his energy, exerts his mind and strives. (1) What now, O’ monks, is the effort is avoid? Perceiving a form, or a sound, or an odour, or a taste, or a bodily or mental impression, the monk neither adheres to the whole, nor to its parts. And he strives to ward off that through which evil and unwholesome things might arise, such as greed and sorrow, if he remained with unguarded senses; and he watches over his senses, restrains his senses.

The monk develops the factors to enlightenment, bent on solitude, on detachment, on extinction, and ending in deliverance, namely, mindfulness ( sati ) investigation of the Dhamma ( Dhammavicaya ), concentration ( samàdhi ) effort ( viriya ), joy ( pãti ), repose ( passaddhi ), equanimity ( upekkhà ). This is called the effort to develop. (4) What now is the effort to maintain?

Upadhi means: substratum of existence. In the commentaries there are enumerated four kinds: The fi ve groups ( khandha ), sensuous desire ( kàma ), mental defi lements ( kilesa ), kamma. In the Sutta, it occurs frequently and with reference to Nibbàna, in the phrase “the abandoning of all substrata” ( sabb ’ åpadhi-pañinissaggo ). The detachment from upadhi subtraction of existence brings about vivekavà which means detachment, seclusion, is according to Niddesa, of three kinds: (1) bodily detachment ( kàya-viveka ), i.e. abiding in solitude free from alluring sensuous objects; (2) mental detachment ( citta-viveka ), such as the inner detachment from sensuous things; (3) detachment from the substrata of existence ( upadhi-viveka ). vãraü : hero. Here, this word is used in the spiritual sense to denote a person who possesses spiritual virility.

They represent, therefore, the aspect of fi rmness of the spiritual faculties. The Power (1) becomes manifest in the four qualities of the streamwinner ( sotàpannassa angàni ), (2) in the four right efforts ( padhàna ), (3) in the four foundations of mindfulness ( satipaññàna ), (4) in the four absorptions ( jhàna ), and (5) in the full comprehension of the four noble truths ( sacca )."},{"pageNumber":1639,"pageContent":"1639 419.

He would rap on their skulls and say, “This is the skull of a man who has been reborn in hell; this man has been reborn as an animal; this man has been reborn as a ghost; this is the skull of a man who has been reborn in the world of men.” The bràhmans thought to themselves, “We can use this man to prey upon the world.” So clothing him in two red robes, they took him about the country with them, saying to everyone they met, “This bràhman Vangãsa can tell by rap- ping on the skulls of dead men in which of the states of exist- ence they have been reborn; ask him to tell you in which of the states of existence your own kinsmen have been reborn.” People would give him ten pieces of money or twenty or a hundred according to their several means, and would ask him in which of the states of existence their kinsmen had been reborn. After travelling from place to place, they fi nally reached Sàvatthi and took up their abode near the Jetavana. After breakfast they saw throngs of people going with perfumes, garlands, and the like in their hands to hear the Dhamma. “Where are you going?” they asked. “To the monastery to hear the Dhamma,” was the reply. ‘What will you gain by going there?” asked the bràhmans; “there is nobody like our fellow bràhman Vangãsa.

Just ask him in which of the states of existence your own kinsmen have been reborn.” “What does Vangãsa know!” replied the disciples, “there is no one like our Teacher, who is the Buddha.” But the bràhmans retorted, “There is no one like Vangãsa,” and the dispute waxed hot. Finally the disciples said, “Come now, let us go fi nd out which of the two knows the more, your Vangãsa or our Teacher.” So taking the bràh- mans with them, they went to the Monastery. The Buddha, knowing that they were on their way, pro- cured and placed in a row fi ve skulls, one each of men who had been reborn in the four states of existence: hell, the ani- mal world, the world of men, and the world of the deities; and one skull belonging to a man who had attained arahatship. When they arrived, He asked Vangãsa, “Are you the man of whom it is said that by rapping on the skulls of dead men you can tell in which of the states of existence they have been reborn?” “Yes,” said Vangãsa. “Then whose is this skull?” Vangãsa rapped on the skull and said, “This is the skull of a man who has been reborn in Hell.” “Good! good!” exclaimed the Buddha, applauding him. Then the Buddha asked him about the next three skulls, and Vangãsa answered without making a mistake. The Buddha applauded him for each answer he gave and fi nally showed him the fi fth skull. “Whose skull is this?” he asked. Vangãsa rapped on the fi fth skull as he had on the others, but confessed that he did not know in which of the states of existence the man had been reborn. Then said the Buddha, “Vangãsa, don’t you know?” “No,” replied Vangãsa, “I don’t know.” “I know,” the Buddha said. Thereupon, Vangãsa asked him, “Teach me this charm.” “I can- not teach it to one who is not a monk.” Thought the bràhman to himself, “If I only knew this charm, I should be the foremost"},{"pageNumber":1642,"pageContent":"1642 man in all Jambudãpa.” Accordingly, he dismissed his fellow bràhmans, saying, “Remain right here for a few days; I intend to become a monk.” And he became a monk in the name of the Buddha, was admitted a full member of the Sangha, and was thereafter known as Venerable Vangãsa. They gave him as his meditation topic the thirty-two constituent parts of the body and said to him, “Repeat the preliminary words of the formula.” He followed their instruc- tions and repeated the preliminary words of the formula. From time to time, the bràhmans would ask him, “Have you learned the formula?” and the Venerable would answer, “Just wait a little! I am learning it.” In but a few days he attained arahatship. When the bràhmans asked him again, he replied, “Brethren, I am now unable to learn it.” When the monks heard his reply, they said to the Buddha, “Venerable, this monk utters what is not true and is guilty of falsehood.” The Buddha replied, “Monks, say not so.

Thereupon he thought to himself, “I must now turn over all of my property to Dham- madinnà.” Now it had previously been his custom on return- ing home, in case he saw Dhammadinnà looking out of the window, to smile pleasantly at her. But on this particular day, although she was standing at the window, he passed by with- out so much as looking at her. “What can this mean?” thought she. “Never mind, when it is mealtime, I shall fi nd out.” So when meal-time came, she offered him the usual portion of boiled rice. Now on previous days it had been his custom to say, “Come, let us eat together.” But on this particular day he ate in silence, uttering not a word. “He must be angry about something,” thought Dhammadinnà. After the meal Visàkhà settled himself in a comfortable place, and summoning Dhammadinnà to his side, said to her, “Dhammadinnà, all the wealth that is in this house is yours. Take it!” Thought Dhammadinnà, “Persons who are angry do not offer their property and say, ‘Take it!’ What can this mean?” After a time, however, she said to her husband, “But, husband, what about you?” “From this day forth, I shall engage no more in worldly affairs.” ‘Who will accept the saliva you have rejected? In that case permit me also to become a nun.” “Very well, dear wife,” replied Visàkhà, giving her the desired permission.

Thereupon she thought to herself, “Now, by reason of me, my kinsfolk will perform works of merit.” Accordingly she returned once more to Ràjagaha. When the lay disciple Visàkhà heard that she had returned, he thought to himself, ‘What can be her reason for returning?” And going to the nuns’ convent and seeing the nun, his former wife, he saluted her and seated himself respectfully on one side. Thought he, “It would be highly improper for me to say to her, ‘noble sister, pray are you discontented?’ I will therefore ask her this ques- tion.” So he asked her a question about the path of conversion, and she immediately answered it correctly. Continuing this line of questioning, the lay disciple asked about the remain- ing paths also. He did not stop, however, at this point, but continuing his questions, asked her about arahatship. ‘Won- derful, brother Visàkhà!” exclaimed Dhammadinnà. “But if you desire to know about arahatship, you should approach the Buddha and ask him this question.” Visàkhà saluted the nun his former wife, and rising from his seat and going to the Buddha, told the Buddha about their talk and conversation. Said the Buddha, “What my daughter Dhammadinnà said was well said. In answering this question I also should answer it as follows.” Then he gave the stanza.

Strange did he appear to his wife. She inquired for the reasons. Then he confessed that his mind had undergone a transformation to something “rich and strange” Dhammadinnà promptly asked for permission to go to Buddha. Visàka could not but consent. She was sent in a golden palanquin. She was ordained as a nun. She felt that if she were to be unsuccessful in the life of Bhikkhunã then her purpose of joining the noble Sangha was in vain. She repaired to a solitary place and strove with might and main to obtain the fruit of arahatship. Her past resolution with good kamma had the desired effect. She became an arahat. As such she visited the home town of Ràjagaha so that she could be of service to her fellow creatures who knew her. The erstwhile husband did not understand. He thought that her mission was a failure and that she was returning empty handed. The husband plied her with questions and she deftly answered them. Finally he asked her about Nibbàna. Here he was out of his depth. He was not so advanced. He was at sea with her answers. So she referred him to the Buddha who not only concurred but also extolled Dhammadinnà for her learning the lesser Vedalla Sutta in the Majjhima Nikàya.

His career offers a con- trast. He was born to a counsellor, called Bhaggawa, to the king of Kosala. According to custom the child was sent to the university of Taxila where he had a distinguished career. His name was converted to Ahiüsaka (harming none) partly because he hailed from a family whose shield was untarnished by crime, and partly because of the child’s character. He excelled in study and in sports. Soon, he incurred the jealousy and hostility of his colleagues who plotted against him. But he was very strong due to his ministrations in a former birth to a Pacceka Buddha. His enemies could not prevail against him. He was a favourite of the vice chancellor of the university. Soon, he incurred hostility due to the whispering campaigns of his enemies. They spoke of his illicit love to his wife. But he, too, being a clever and learned man, bided his time to compass his death. When the leave-taking took place, he asked for the usual tribute due from a student to a teacher in the shape of an extraordinary request. He asked for one thousand right thumbs of human-beings. Ahiüsaka was taken aback and promptly refused so sanguinary a request. But the end was adamant. In the event of refusal a curse would be on him. Again and again he pleaded in vain for another tribute. There was no escape from the rigid ancient custom as the tribute was in lieu of past tuition fees. So Ahiüsaka demurred – consented in order to preserve the learning, for a refusal would act as a blight. Having"},{"pageNumber":1653,"pageContent":"1653 armed himself, he repaired to the forest called Jàlita in the Kosala kingdom. He killed all and sundry who ventured into his domain. But the thumbs could not be preserved. Either the wild animals ate them, or they became rotten. He therefore got a garland made and was wearing it. Hence he was called ‘Anguli Màla’ He had 999 thumbs and was anxious to secure one more to close this bloody chapter. His teacher thought Anguli Màla would never survive the campaign. He would assuredly be slain in the process, or taken captive by the king. It was a fateful morning. The king, on receiving complaints from the people was setting out to capture the bandit, dead or alive. His mother Mantàni was anxious about the fate of her son. She implored her husband to warn the son of the impending danger. But he would have none of it. So the mother’s love urged her to plunge into the forest, alone crying out that the son must pay heed to the family tradition by giving up kill- ing and that the king’s army was on the march to capture him. It was very likely that the bandit might not spare his own mother, for he was desperate. The all-compassionate Buddha saw his impending doom. He knew that he was destined to be an arahat in this very life. He saw the possibilities of redemption. So He planted Himself, despite warnings from the passers by, between the robber and his mother. Here the rob- ber saw that the perfect thumb of the Buddha would be a fi tting fi nale to the series of bloody thumbs. So Anguli Màla hurried towards the Buddha as was his custom with his sword up lifted. The Buddha was going at a measured pace, but with all his speed Anguli Màla was not able to catch up the Buddha. This was willed by the Buddha. It was a psychic feat of the Buddha. Anguli Màla had come to the end of his tether by running so fast and so long.

He, too, must also"},{"pageNumber":1654,"pageContent":"1654 stop. The word ‘stop’ galvanised him. To a potential arahat it has a wealth of meaning. It was closely related to saüsàra – this ceaseless round of births and deaths. He asked the meaning of the word which he had temporarily lost sight of. When he was running the Buddha must have moved, so thought Anguli Màla. Could it be that the Buddha was guilty of a falsehood. So Anguli Màla requested the Buddha to unfold the meaning of stopping. This was the opening the Buddha sought and the Buddha preached with precision and unerring skill. Anguli Màla fl ung the garland and weapons aside. He begged for ordination. At the end of the sermon he became an arahat by the application of ‘ ehi bhikkhu ’ for- mula of the Buddha. With Anguli Màla the arahat the Buddha went back to the temple. It was the custom of the king to visit the Buddha on the eve of a hazardous campaign. The Buddha inquired the cause of the armed expedition. The king explained. The Buddha told the king that Anguli Màla was in the temple. Hearing the very name mentioned the king was trembling. So fearsome was the report of Angulimàla. The Buddha hastened to explain that Anguli Màla in the temple was a far different being from the bloody bandit he was; Anguli Màla would not now even harm an ant. Though an arahat, the name stuck. One day on his rounds, Venerable Anguli Màla heard the birth pangs of an expectant mother in labour. Other Màha arahats must have heard the cries. But none of them was moved to the extent of Venerable Anguli Màla. He approached the Buddha and confessed his concern at such suffering and begged the Buddha to allay the anguish. The Buddha asked him to meditate upon the power of truth – inasmuch as Anguli Màla was entirely devoid since birth of cruelty, so by virtue of that truth, the suffering may be assuaged.

He got this shawl thoroughly cleaned. He honoured the relics by planting the same as a banner on a long bamboo, by the side of the dàgoba . An evil spirit chief called Abhisaümathaka had the shawl secretly planted on the top of the dàgoba. When he saw what had happened, his joy knew no bounds. By reason of this merit, he never failed to have a following, wherever he was born. He was always a leader. He was born many times as Sakka, king of deities, or as a pow- erful king (chakravarthiràja). Thereafter, he was born in this dispensa- tion, in a bràhmin’s family. He was named Upavàna. He, too, became well-versed in Vedic lore. He was an attendant of the Buddha before Venerable ânanda took up the task. Upon the Buddha falling ill, Upavàna went to a lay supporter, or dàyaka , and extolled the virtue of the Buddha. He procured from him warm water and suitable medicine and rendered medical aid to cure the Buddha. Thereafter, he applied himself to the monk’s life so incessantly that in no time he became an arahat. There was a notable incident in connection with the passing away of the Blessed One. While he was standing by the couch, fan- ning, the Buddha requested him to leave. All present were struck by the remark. The elder ânanda, who was as usual the spokesman, inquired as to the reason. The Buddha told ânanda how hundreds and thousands of the invisible world, powerful devàs and evil spirits, were hunting for every inch, and often pin-points, of available space to have a last look at the Buddha. It is no secret that, unlike in the case of worldings who were transparent to the gaze of devàs and all, arahats were not. Therefore, Venerable Upavàna had to allow them a way to see. He was one of the eighty arahats of the noble Sangha."},{"pageNumber":1659,"pageContent":"1659 About the Author Venerable Weragoda Sàrada Mahà Thero, the author of Treasury of Truth (Illustrated Dhammapada) was born in Sri Lanka in 1941.
