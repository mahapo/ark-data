This advice shows us that the Buddha’s Dhamma and Disci- pline cannot be separated from Nature. Nature teaches us lessons about the impersonal nature of existence – about birth, life and death. It is therefore timely that Venerable Sujiva, a very well- loved and respected Theravadin monk in Malaysia, now offers us an opportunity to learn from his insights into Nature, among other things, in his latest book Wind in the Forest . The present book is a unique col- lection of poems, write-ups, illustrations and photos. In Venerable Sujiva’s sincere and heart-felt writings, readers will find many touching incidents related by him in his many years of teaching. They will also come to understand him, his compassion and loving-kind- ness, as well as the Dhamma, by simply flowing with his pen.

Their goals have been progressively realised and over the years the society has generated interest in Vipassana Meditation through its practice and publications. On behalf of the bwc , I wish to express our heartfelt gratitude to our spiritual advisor, Rev. Sujiva, who has been instrumental in guiding and motivating us in this noble practice. It is therefore apt that the bwc publish this book by our spiritual advisor, entitled The Wind in the Forest, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the society. I take this opportunity to thank the founding mem- bers, past and present committee members and the meditation guides for their untiring efforts in carrying the activities of the society. At the same time, a great Sadhu! to all members and well-wishers for supporting the society from the spiritual and financial aspects. May the bwc grow in wisdom and strength.

The other difference is an emphasis on our natural environment. I do hope our Malaysian Buddhists can be more aware and concerned about our greens. It had and will play an important role in spirituality. However, the book did not come about for that purpose. I happened to find myself moving in that direction for, as in the past, the forest and the monk go hand in hand. As for the wind, it’s the Dhamma. When the yogi con- templates on the body and mind as mere processes, they can be perceived just like ‘winds’ — sometimes turbulent, at other times cool and blissful, but never- theless ungraspable and void. The poem whose title the book bears is actually about such a situation. The yogi or monk meditates where he strives to lose him- self in Nature.

Not in the way some people talk to themselves. It’s more of a communication, but not like what the mediums do during seances. When you develop keen awareness while working with and among plants, you can sense their unique characteristics, not just their external mor- phology but qualities which seem to tell you about the nature of life, the ways of the world and so forth. It enlivens and inspires my spirit- ual life as well as contributing to good health. Everyone should learn the ancient language Nature speaks.

The old have but memories of things long gone. The young live on bright hopes yet to be fulfilled. Even the present is fleeting, too fast to catch. What peo- ple perceive when they say “now” is already the immediate past. Therefore when we say we live in the present, we are using the word “present” as a convenient tool of communication. What we really mean to say is to be with reality. If we can do that perfectly, we can be considered enlightened.

Suddenly I was once again A little mousedeer With tiny feet, Timid and gentle, Soft and hidden, Fearful of humans with little wit, Cruel in means, Running free through the lush undergrowth, Fleeing fast between the shifting shadows, Following the lead of the stream side trails Infested with leeches, littered full with leaves, Deep in the jungle Home of the king of the beasts. 3 December 1994 Camp Matang , Sarawak \u0001 Do you know that the mousedeer is actually not a deer? It’s more closely related to the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23 camel. It is a loveable, small creature, less than a foot high. Often featured in the Malay folk- lore, it plays the role of a hero which outwits predators such as the tiger and crocodile. His- torically, it was responsible for the naming of the state of Malacca, when the state’s founder saw it warding off a tiger while he was resting under a Malacca tree. Having just been chased out from his homeland, the incident must have served as an inspiration to him as did the spi- der to Shakespeare’s King Edward. Personally, I have come across the mousedeer a few times when I lived near the forest. They really looked gentle and vulnerable and so, an object of affection. Unfortunately, they are often hunted as food. A friend tells me that one of the ways to trap them is to capitalise on their unique love of dancing. It seems that if you tap a pair of sticks in a certain rhythm when the animal happens to be around, it cannot help dancing. All you have to do is to make it dance until it is dead tired. He seems genuine in his claim because he reports an incident in which he was personally involved. There was this mousedeer dancing uncontrollably to the taps of sticks. My friend was supposed to shoot it down with his rifle. He could see the creature dancing with tears in its eyes. It obviously knows about this dance of Death! My friend didn’t have the heart to do it. The musician was furious. We now know that even such a wise hero of the jungle has its weakness."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24 Lady Beware!

The inex- perienced usually look for something and usu- ally it is based on lust. But for those involved, it is the most wonderful thing that can possibly happen. Usually I would sympathise with the young man for not being able to become a monk. In this case I sympathise with the female. That’s because the male is the more emotional one and therefore less reasonable. He’s also quite immature and is also more likely to be attrac- ted to another. But who knows, it may just work out.

If you imagine a landscape without trees, you will end up with a desert or the sea. How miserable! Trees have played an important part in Budd- hism. The Buddha was born, lived, preached and died under trees. Each Buddha has his own Enlightenment ( Bodhi ) tree and that will be the one beneath which he sought shelter and eventually gained enlightenment. Our present Buddha Gotama was enlightened under the species of Ficus Religiosa. He himself chose it to represent him when he was not around. Since then Buddhists have shown a special reverence for that tree or its offspring. Strangely enough, people who meditate under it find that they get good results. Faith works wonders. In the past year, planting trees has become one of my passions. They are true friends of Man. They give us food, shelter, medicine and much joy and beauty in life. I have also encouraged"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31 my friends to adopt a tree, spread cremated ashes under a tree and to plant thousands of trees. And I tell you, it is indeed a joy to see them grow tall, above our heads. How tall is a tall tree? Just in case you have wrong idea s , trees are considered short if they fall below 30ft, medium if they are between 30ft and 100ft, and tall if they exceed 100ft. The Borneo Camphor tree can reach a height of 200ft. That’s about four times the height of a normal rubber tree. I planted quite a fair number of them in the her- mitage. The tallest tree we have at present is the Batai (Albizia falcata). It is also the fastest growing tree at the hermitage but extremely brittle. It must be over 50ft by now. We planted it from a seed. The tree does not always last and usually become a victim of lightning. I hope ours lasts, because it’s the only one we have. At present, we have over 190 species of trees at the hermitage and many more if you include the unidentified ones.

Which turns his head around And sends his mind spinning. That too I assure you Is not ecstasy.

Some psychiatrists and psy- chologists are specialised in this field. They know what to say and do. I have read an inter- esting book called “Final Gifts” by Maggie Cal- lanan and Patricia Kelley which gives you a good idea of what to do. As monks, we have often been involved in such situations although that is not really our work. But what is it in life that we are all not involved in? There are many things which I can think of that we should not be involved in! First of all, all the evil and wicked things. I’ll leave you to think about the rest. As for death and dying, it is something very much concerned with spirit- ual life, even though it may not be yours. So, there was this man who was suffering from kidney failure and it looked like his days were numbered. An old lady friend of his believed it was so, because she said, “I have worked in hospitals before and I know. With people who are about to die, their ear lobes shrink. His had shrunk, but I did not tell his children....”"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34 Somebody then checked this out for me and confirmed that it was true. Anyway, I didn’t deny his last request and so I went. The rest you have already read. It may have done him a world of good. Generally, what we have to do is to remove fear, keep him calm and keep his mind in a pure state. Concentra- tion will give the mind strength and hope, but people don’t think of such things until only the last minute when it’s too late. But then, it is also better late than never.

And unless such dreams are fulfilled Or at least still kept alive Can there still be hope for mankind And the world.

A typical feature of this type of forest is the presence of Dipterocarps of which this region is their place of origin. It has the highest number of genera and species (Borneo – 13 genera & 276 species, Peninsular – 14 genera & 68 species). The fam- ily’s distinctive characteristic is its fruit that looks like a shuttlecock. When I was holding a retreat at camp Matang which is at the edge of the Kubah forest reserve, I noticed that the Dipterocarps that formed much of the canopy were bursting into flower. The different colours covered their entire crowns. The sight was breathtaking! It reminded me of a verse in the Ratana Sutta: Just as a fully blossomed woodland tree In the early heat of the warm summer months Such are the excellent teachings he taught Leading to Nibbana , the supreme goal"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"37 In the Buddha is this precious jewel So by this truth may there be well being . Incidentally, one Dipterocarp played an impor- tant role in Buddhism. This is the Shorea Robusta, known commonly as the Sal. The Bodhisatta had his last birth under it. The Buddha’s mahaparinibbana was also under Sal trees. Unfortunately, this species of Shorea is not found locally. I wonder what part our local types of Dipterocarps played during the Buddha’s time. Surely, many species similar to those we have here must have been found in the forest hermitages in Thailand and Burma.

But, there are priorities and trees are not all indispensable. Do you know that there is a precept which specifies that bhikkhus cannot damage or have someone damage plant life? There was a bhikkhu who unintentionally did it, and was later reborn in a woeful state. The morale is, if one did so, do not be filled with remorse over it. One way is to plant more trees to replace the one you removed. And make sure it grows healthily! It takes so long to grow one, but it just takes min- utes to fell it. A Different Pilgrimage A pilgrimage to the past rightly begins With a visit to my invalid mother Who no longer speaks, faculties failing fast Is a pilgrimage to change Another awakening from illusion. A pilgrimage to Nature quietly begins With a visit to the birds in their sanctuary, So distant, quite alien, To what most people are familiar with, Is a pilgrimage to life forgotten, Another renewal of zest for contemplation.

I awake to see a lighthouse before me A beacon of hope for sailors and ships, In a sea of their own making, born of their innate yearnings, Just then the still wilderness which has caught time In its thick meshed tangle of mangrove stilts Throws me into tides of rise and fall, Are these oscillations the regular thrusts of the heron’s wings That my heart rides into the forests and rivers Created by the consciousness? My beacon, my light, that mindfulness Will tell me where to go, It has travelled before along such terrain, It will be my guide. We rode along in a rickety boat In the dark, dark night.

The most important one would be to visit the most inspiring and spiritual places, or if you like the metaphysical word, objects. In this case, it is best done in an intensive meditation practice. I have just begun, on this date, something I have always wanted to do for sometime but kept postponing because of too much work. I decided to go around looking at places and Nature in Malaysia, to help me think about life and whether or not there was anything I’d like to change.

More rightly therefore, it is a time to search within myself what I want to do for the next few years. Nature will help me do it, not a lot of people with wise ideas... Every place, well, almost every place, has a symbol or landmark. In Kuala Selangor, there is the lighthouse. I remember I visited it back in my school days. After that we went there again during my varsity days. This time I looked at it differently. Although I am not an ardent follower of the Chinese “I Ching” which places considerable stress on signs, I have begun to be aware of such things. Rather than predict the future conditions, I read its signifi- cance. Is this what my life is about? To be a light- house? It’s really no fun standing out there in the cold rain. Sure, it’s a noble job but there can be no end to this. Or is it that I have to be sure of my own Lighthouse? Who doesn’t need to? That Lighthouse is the Dhamma itself, and the Light is the light of Wisdom, which is devel- oped from the light of mindfulness.

From the simpler lives that they live, they may actually be happier, in certain ways, than a lot of stress-ridden humans! If only humans made much better use of their potentials. As for the fire flies, called kelip-kelip in Malay, these are silly. All those blips go on and off in unison, so what? It’s great if you have not seen fireflies before, and there are many who haven’t. I can also see some couples making full use of the dark situation. As for me, I liked it only when it started raining and saw the dis- tant light from the jetty. It gave me an idea of how a fisherman might feel when he returns late at night and sees the light in his hut still burning.

For us, the temperature was a bit too cold for comfort. Warmth was the answer, and it came with blankets and fire by the hearth. When the world is cold, what can you do to warm it up? Loving-kindness and compassion can do the job. The other thing is the energy fired up by a noble aim, such as, the striving for the ultimate goal of liberation. Why has man become so cold? I asked myself. A heightened perception of non-self does dampen loving-kindness somewhat. The sharp- ened perception of human defilements and their suffering also seem to decrease it and instead, one opts for compassion. But it is a distant, detached kind of compassion. You don’t find much solace from people any more. So you go to the trees, the rivers and the sky. It’s happier by oneself than with confused crankies.

I finally came across it when I was in the Cameron Highlands. Despite the size, it had only a few seeds, which I planted in two special containers. I was only away for a day when some creature, an oversized gecko I sus- pect, devoured them. The conditions were not yet quite right. We do need a fair amount of conditions to make a dream come true.

Rose-apple trees too take time to mature, and I think, at least five years. But they produce delightfully fragrant fruits, belonging to the Myrtle family. They are not too sweet and when compared to other tropical fruits, are clean (unlike the messy Durians and Chempedak). India, also called Jambudipa, is actually named after it – The Land of Rose-Apples. The Bodhisatta was meditating under it while his father was engaged in the ploughing festival. Some past Buddha had also been enlightened under it.

The Dream of West Lake At Hangzhou Barren trees with twisted trunks greet us, The West Lake too, darkened by the night Is not different from any other shore, But in the light I beheld Where lovers’ dreams come true. Even in this season With her head shorn of her willowy braids, Her limbs stripped naked of her peach blossoms pink, There’s still much magic In this three dimensional silk screen lake woven by the finest fibres of sensual creations – a net if you’re unaware, a net that keeps you entrapped in mundane sufferings. 3 March 1995 Hangzhou , China A little boat rows by silently Across the flat face of a speechless lake, No water ripples, only peace flowing, The morning mist had spread all over A dreamy atmosphere for admiring visitors."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"61 I do not see the slim maiden spinning her flowered umbrella Sitting on the boat, smiling; I do not hear lute strings strummed Under the willow tree by her lover entranced; Neither do I have time to listen to The poet sings his song to welcome spring; Come my heart, this world you see here Finer than the finest silk screen Is but a dream. The boat moors at the banks; Peddlers crowd in to sell beads and other wares; The distant pavilion is still sleeping Even though dawn had come calling; The farther shore of trees is whistling happily to itself Indifferent to our intrusion. But I do not see lovers walking hand in hand, I do not hear birds chirping or bees buzzing, I do not have time to pen my poem then, But I will, when I return home With West Lake in my chest. Come dear heart, did you remember what I said? That silk screen dream has vanished forever. Is it then, any different from the other illusions? Spring has come, but not the flowers. 16 March 1995 Kuching , Sarawak , Malaysia \u0001 The change of plans to stay in Hangzhou was an extra bonus. I had not been there before."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"62 Besides, there is the famed West Lake that I’ve heard so much about. I’ve seen it in photo- graphs but it does not make enough sense for all that praise. We were allowed only half an hour to visit the Lake in the morning before we headed for our destination, Huang Shan. I think we spent much less time than that. Being there is different. You find yourself in very fine surroundings. You don’t feel the quietness and coolness by looking at pic- tures. Then there is that three dimensional spa- tial effect. The quiet movement of the boats and most of all, there seems to be a subtle hint of romance intermingled with a carefree attitude in the air. The lines that make up the picture are very fine and the colours subtle. Even though we came at a time when the trees were still stark naked, it was still beautiful. The only snag is that this type of beauty is purely sensual. The pleasures I can assume will be connected with craving although it may be of the finer variety. Harmless though it may be, it is the beginning and the final stages of the stronger passions which cause Man his immense suffering. And I say beginning, because it often starts that way, seemingly harmless and extremely pleasant. It is soft, fine, attractive and finally intoxicating. Once addicted, it becomes that passionate obsession. Have you fallen in love before? Don’t you think that what I say is true?"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"63 I also say final stages because before the pas- sion ends through your practice of detachment, it subsides into a fine state. It then becomes undetectable and you feel good. Complacency hides it altogether and it will not be long before it grows again. That is why I say it is a fine and beautifully woven net, like a silk screen. This is a good lesson for those who intend to reach beyond the realm of the senses, towards the fine material sphere (Rupavacara) of the Jhanas, and what more the unconditioned Nib- bana. We cannot afford to underestimate the power of the finer aspects of these sensual pleasures, although we have to deal with the grosser forms with appreciable success first. One point to bear in mind is to really know and appreciate the joys, happiness and harmless- ness of the peaceful pure mind. The Poet of Huang Shan 1.

From the base of our hotel, it took us 20 minutes to reach the cable car station and another 8 min- utes to the peaks. Looking below at the deep valleys, I could see the steps curling uphill steeply like a necklace. The climbers were like specks of tiny flowers gradually moving upwards. The whole scene was quite breathtaking, like a Chinese painting come alive; like entering into the heaven of the Taoist immortals. It’s indeed strange, because with the practice, the mind is no longer intoxicated with these scenes although the curiosity is still there. I must remember the proverb – Curiosity kills the Cat. This is also the first time I walked on ice, melt- ing ice. We saw people selling grass slippers. It seems it helps in the walking. It didn’t help me very much, in fact, the Reeboks do better with- out them. Quite a few people came round to support me, including some locals for a fee. I think they make things worse.

However, one thing is certain, I never did see so much snow before, all around us sparkling. It’s also strange how quickly one takes it for granted. The guide tells us that there are four things unique to Huang Shan – the curious pines, the grotesque rocks, the sea of clouds and the hot springs. I have tried to personify them into the Huang Shan hermit. There must have been many hermits living here in the past and there is a remnant of a temple now converted into something else. Of the three places of poets, this is the more spiritual one because of its clean natural surroundings. Now, Huang Shan is a park and it’s worth visit- ing. Two nights and two days are insufficient. It’s too vast a place to get a real feel of it in such a short time. 3.

This is one thing I’m trying to find out. Cer- tainly, not the command of a language. Many exponents of a language are not poets. By the time I came here, I had come to the conclusion that heightened sensitivity together with the outpouring of emotions aroused is one factor, and then there is the desire to express one’s feelings. Of these two factors, the former is the heart of the poet. Maybe that’s why love poems are often the more well-written ones. The com- mand of the language is the tool for expression. Still without this, there won’t be any written down. In the Dhamma, the depth of the teaching and its universal application make the verses dis- tinctive. This is truly so when one considers that the concentration and penetration of a cultivated mind is indeed a sharp and sensitive instru- ment. The feelings that come with it are also not lacking. The paeans of joy (Udana) and verses of the Elders (Thera/Theri Gatha) are examples of these.

How things can be other than our expectations! The flowers have not yet bloomed and the sea of clouds comes only after a thunderstorm, which is unique to summer. However, the present season offers us very clear views and more solitude due to a low number of visitors. A Poet’s send off The sun sets gold over the Yangzi Our boat will leave this evening The river is China With its long and turbulent history, I leave you my friend, After a brief acquaintance.

Peace comes with such understanding. As I watch the city lights of Sha Shi retreat, As the foam thrusts us forward towards the gorges, I think of all those I have met and left And I have come to accept one fact, That truly, A short acquaintance with a sweet parting Is far better than A long episode with a bitter conclusion. Man will come and man will go But what will he carry with him In his heart when he departs? The sun has set The night covers the Yangzi with inky darkness I see not your homeland now, Only the chilly winds blow.

When he took us to the Yellow Crane Tower, he recited and tried to translate some poems conceived there by some ancient Chinese Masters. Li Bai, according to him, wrote eight poems on a single visit. Because he had an interest in this field, I promised to write him one. Before I went on board at Sha Shi, (we were originally to board at Wuhan but the water level was too low) he asked it of me again. I roughly wrote this there and polished it up when I returned. The Song of the Gorges Between steep cliffs Passed by chilly winds I journey along your cruel waters Not knowing how it ends Never to know its head. Here the Great Earth divides Here the misty river meets the sky Here I cruise through your Evil Gates Here too I’ll hear your battle cry."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"74 The gorges are countless variations Poetic expressions An interplay of 3 distinct elements In the history of Man’s struggle. The fickle, temperamental sky, indifferent to feelings, The harsh, hard land, bleak and never giving in, The ferocious river, cruel, dangerous and untameable, Crashing head on Onto the man of steel Heart numb to pain Innards fired with determination To survive or win. His mark often devastating At times awe inspiring Is pathetic and meagre here Merely a few little houses Clinging precariously to the steep slopes Linked by pathways like single line scratches With narrow bridges spanning chasms. I see them stubbornly hammering the boulders I see them braving the waters on tiny vessels I see them inching narrow paths Carrying heavy loads This land is cruel and hard Every plot that can be tilled has been planted Still it’s desolate for miles, Bare rocky landscape With the indomitable river cutting through it. In this misty weather The gorges are mere perpendicular lines drawn over blue tones"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"75 With the indomitable river crashing into it. How can such a place be also a land of beauty? The gorges are charged with emotions There are echoes of the dead and drowned calling incessantly, The groans of their sufferings threaten to swallow the ship, The cries of your murderers bite into our livers, Many have died in vain in your waters, Many others surrendered their fate to obscurity. And yet you cry: March on, Strive on, Fight to the very end, Never will there be such a victory! Better to die than to live in disgrace of defeat, Follow me, break open the gates of hell! You have a right to be free, the will to be happy, Sail on, Push on, Never will there be a more glorious victory! The Song of the gorges is a battle cry Thrown into eternity from idealism, ambition and adventure, Thundering as the river with drums to the sky Or screaming in cold, bleak desperation of winter ice. Are you trying to tell me there’s beauty in adventure Even if it be a battle that’ll cost a thousand lives? Even if it be a war that’ll shed floods of tears As the waters that inundate the lands And fill this raging long river? I know only of a struggle that’s worth all those troubles, The struggle within to extricate all thorns of the heart Let it be then that I’ll think of you in that respect"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"76 Though your culture here, as I understand it Is as bare of such struggle as the meagre dwellings man has made Along your precipitous cliffs. 9 March 1995 On the Yangzi off Feng Du , Sichuan , China \u0001 In the days before the advent of aeroplanes or even motor vehicles, the river route to the inac- cessible interior was often resorted to, although dangerous. Then, I can imagine, the gorges were a pass of great emotions. It is here that we see the gateways that link different worlds. The journey obviously took time and risks, and so it was not always attempted. When one passes through, one leaves a whole world behind and meets an uncertain new world. The awesome scenario, sandwiched on both sides by tower- ing, cold and hard cliffs, accentuated the feel- ings further. Here, history tells us, is also the scene of many battles. Relics from the “Three Kingdoms Period” remind us of this. Even in this century where China is ravaged by wars, the Yangzi gorges had played a significant role. And yet in the silence, when one looks at all there is around one, it’s all quite majestic. Looking from my cabin, each scene that passes by is a work of art framed by the glass window. One thing, however, is inescapable – the land is harsh and bleak. At present, the weather con- dition is still pretty cold."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"77 We made stops at certain places each day. One amusing event happened at Feng Du. The city lies outside the three gorges nearer to Cong- qing. Ancient stories passed down tell us that ghostly haunts are common here. I have also read somewhere that it was a centre for necro- mancy (but is it still such a centre, after the cultural revolution?). When we arrived, we met with many cripples (not met elsewhere) lining the walk from the wharf. Our guide greeted us with, “Welcome to Ghost City.” When asked about the ghosts in the area, she replied in the affirmative, and added that at night, you see a lot of people who are actually ghosts. “In front of people’s houses there is a pot of water for people to put money in. If it is ghost’s money, it will float. Otherwise it will sink.” I wonder at that point if she’s trying to enter- tain us or insulting our intelligence. Well, she’s certainly not laughing. Then we were brought by bus to what I call a large scale, third-class Disneyland Haunted House. I take my hat off to them because they have really spent some money and effort to make it good, but it’s just... sloppy. Inciden- tally, it’s not a display of statues of ghosts. Rather, it portrays various scenes of the differ-"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"78 ent levels of hell. Maybe they should rename it Hell City instead. Just before we left the place I came across a group of elderly men spending their time lei- surely near our bus. One of them told us that we had come to the wrong place. The real Ghost City is up on the other hill. “See those cable car lines? It takes you there. They have taken you to the wrong place, a newly built facade!” After shaking his head and looking at our astonished faces, he continued, “You take the steps up here, that’s the way to the Real Ghost City of the Tang Dynasty. Peo- ple who died all ended up there.” That made me even more astonished. And as if to rub it in deeper, he asked, “Do you believe in it? Do you believe in it?” Just then a plump woman started pulling my robes from behind. She started asking, “What religion do you believe in? Are you a monk?” Then, to prove the point, I took off my woollen cap to show my shaven head, triumphantly saying:"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"79 “See, I’m a monk.” The old man was not at all convinced, and so he said almost immediately: “Real monks burn holes in their heads.” At this point, Mr. Kuan who had been listening with interest, could take it no longer. He just shouted back with his usual “high volume.” “Burnt holes in the head don’t make a monk. It’s the heart that counts!” Once back in the bus, our friends started com- plaining to the guide, claiming that they had been taken for a ride. “You should have taken us to the Real Ghost City!” The reply was that we had all been complaining of being exhausted after the difficult climb up the White King’s City yesterday, and so it was decided for us that we would be spared any more ordeals. The cable car by the way, leads only up to a third of the climb. As I suspected, it is a temple with castings of scenes of Hell. Well, if it’s really a Ghost City, I don’t think anyone of us would want to step in there. This clearly shows one thing – that the Chinese will capitalise on anything, including ghosts and hell. If you don’t believe me, then I ask you: “why are they selling Hell Bank Notes at the shops?”"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"80 Just before we left, I asked our (ghost) guide again, “Are there really ghosts in this place?” She gave us one really disgusted look and replied: “ No ! ̈ Congqing This is one drab and dirty city The trees are black The streets – the dustiest. Dark tunnels lead you round and round To nowhere else Except around and within The Dustbin of Yangzi. You say you love this land of yours But I say otherwise with no disrespect, That if I were ever given the choice I’ll never step back in here again. This is one overcrowded city Its population far exceeding All we have in all of ours. You say your ladies are the fairest in the land I see only a sea of ugly faces. Only the laughs of children glow warmth and cherry Before any flowers burst forth in season.

Then you took us to where fossils are kept Of dinosaurs unearthed, now displayed In a museum I dare say is the coldest place on earth Most of us who ventured in, came out sick. But I admit the pandas were just great And the racoons the cutest things I’ve seen. But sad to say, they were the only specimens we saw Quite caged up when they should be free, Outnumbered by crude man-made animal figurines. O Congqing! There’s no poetry here, Tomorrow I’ll leave you with no love lost. Send me off safe and sound back home To Guangzhou first, on your disreputable airline, That’s the only request of you I plead. 10 March 1995 Congqing , Sichuan , China \u0001 The poem, I am ashamed to say, is quite unfair. There must be many nice things here. But the first impression of the pollution is strong and hard to forget. The guide did give us a very well-planned tour of the city. She speaks fairly good English and conducted things efficiently. The city seems to have everything from a zoo, to museums to an airport. Here we were again brought to a hospital."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82 As anticipated, we were led to be convinced of the medicines’ miraculous cure for suffering. Unlike the fiasco at Guangzhou, the spokes- woman, a lady doctor-professor displayed superior skill in salesmanship. She spoke in a clear voice with eyes wide open, and soon, confidence saturated the whole atmosphere: “This is Doctor... (so sorry, I forgot his name) he is an exponent in Qi Gong.” Taking hold of two wires and a test pen in her hand, she proved it to us, “Look, these are two live wires with 200 volts each. The doctor will demonstrate his powers.” No sooner had she completed the introduction than the good doctor who went into a horse- riding stance, started grunting and puffing like a first-class Gong Fu master. Well, I thought, this is a treat – the first time I’ve seen a doctor in his uniform performing his martial arts skill at a hospital! When he held on to the live wires, one in each hand, she tested him with a test pen to prove that his body was electrified. (I should have tested the type of shoes he was wearing). “So, if there is anyone who wants a massage that will cure him of manifold ills, the doctor will see to that. The price is 100 Renminbi.”"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"83 I like her, she goes straight to the point. I’m sure she could see that we were impressed, but she didn’t stop there. Next, she turned to a quiet young lady, also in a doctor’s uniform and said, “This is also another Qi Gong expert. Do not underestimate her powers. She specialises in face massage that will definitely make you look younger. Now, we will demonstrate. Will a vol- unteer step out?” After much persuasion, Bee Hua’s mother became the guinea pig. And do you know what happened next? After the massage, everyone started praising her for her new found youth. With all that teasing, her face was beaming with smiles. It’s hard to tell if it was the Qi Gong or not, but definitely, she and everyone else were happy about it. Another thing, however, is also definite – she didn’t look any younger. Again, the professor stresses her point, “If there is anyone who wishes to have her service...” Before you know it, many of us had been swept off our feet by her salesmanship. Mr. Kuan, who although refusing any involvement earlier, was the first to step out. Then there was Lee"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"84 Lee Kim and Jee Kong, the latter being only too pleased because he was sick on the boat. As she turned to more and more Qi Gong medi- cal experts, of which the hospital here seemed to have an inexhaustible supply, fear must have shown in our faces, because it looked like she wouldn’t rest until all of us were subjected to the mercy of her people. The guide must have felt it and quickly inter- rupted, “You don’t have to if you don’t want to.” That professor became quite surprised and annoyed by the treachery of her Congqing com- rade, and so started protesting in an incoher- ent manner. After that, I used my usual trick of looking for the toilet. This is the common Chinese attribute again – overdoing things. Our super saleswoman was overselling her goods. One must know one’s limits or else the whole scene starts to stink. Moderation is still the best policy. And is it worth that 100 Renminbi? Mr. Kuan does not think so. The moment he got on the bus, he started protesting. “I tell you this, it is all nonsense. They just massage and rub you all over like a stupid fool."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"85 I feel the same after that. And you,” he said, looking angrily at our own guide from Malaysia, “why do you bring us to such places?” Mr. Goh shot back, “Somebody requested!” Lee Lee Kim and Jee Kong seemed quite pleased about it when they returned. Especially Jee Kong who said he felt better. But one unex- pected thing happened. They could not sleep the following night no matter how tired they were. The massage must have done something to their nervous systems. It was therefore a relief to arrive at the best place around – the Holiday Inn Hotel. But then, that’s not Cong- qing. That’s some place imported from far away. Death on Wheels Motorcyclists, Death on wheels racing on highways, Swerving between cars, Frightening drivers and pedestrians.

Stress levels ought to have risen proportionately. The rise in the number of yogis cannot be expected to follow suit as time becomes scarcer. There is, however, something that is keeping up with the times – The Divine Messengers, namely Birth, Sickness, Old Age and Death. We may think of Death coming dressed as the Grim Reaper, or in the case of the Chinese, as the pair of Mr. Black and Mr. White, with the oft-quoted “Once you’ve seen me, your fortune has arrived.” Death reminders, if you are observant enough, are always around.

Elections Even the trees have been dragged Into the fray of political affiliations Forced to voice the views of others With words pasted onto their silent trunks For candidates they know nothing of Whether or not they will help their brothers in Nature To survive and flourish Or send them into extinction To be together with the lot of dinosaurs. In going to vote as a monk, I feel guilty; Although as a citizen, it is solemn responsibility. Sheepishly I put a finger into the affairs of man today, Then ran back wondering how another in robes Could run for a seat in the parliament. After that I’m exhausted as well as disgusted, Retreated into a far away oil palm estate, In a quiet free state I looked back at how the world And the rest of day pass by peacefully!

At times, this was because I was abroad in Myanmar or Thai- land, while at other times, I was busy in another state. There was once, I recall, I was teaching in East Malaysia when the elections were taking place. Then, when I was looking for a toilet halfway during a journey, I came across an election booth. Quickly, they came towards me to call me to the polling booth. I don’t think they were disappointed when they found out that I had different intentions. I, on the other hand, was amused. Don’t they think that a monk would not be included in the electoral roll in a remoter part of Sabah? This time around, I made it a point to vote. I felt a bit odd because a monk should be removed from such worldly affairs.

Such was the case when I was called out to conduct a night service for the father of a deceased friend who died some years ago. Since my friend’s death, I have rarely met his relatives, whom I used to meet when I went to his house in Sedili while he was alive. When I met them again, his brothers were still as friendly and they spoke of their deceased brother as if he was really around. They dreamt of him visiting their then-ailing father. All the environment and feelings made his presence so strongly felt that even I thought he was around in spirit. But memories are just memories; mere impres- sions from the past imprinted in the mental processes, and empty like all conditioned phe- nomena.

Do I remem- ber it because of fond attachment? I don’t think so. There are other factors involved. The depth of the impression depended on the strength of the impact (of contact); the feelings that arise also depended on it and the train of thoughts that followed. I had known this friend for a period of 10 years, and we did many fine things together. I suppose that left quite a bit of left- over impressions in the memory. So when they emerged, I had to note mindfully . The Station of Life The station of life is here Where man leaves this world Discarding his broken cart Here too where he enters Out of his mother’s womb In another shape. I too first met the world here And after that I came again Many times To stations of life such as this Where meeting is pleasure, Parting usually pain.

Some say it’s a house of suffering ( Rumah Sakit – in Malay) but others prefer to call it a place of healing. In a way, it is also like a station where people come into (i.e. born) and leave (i.e. die) this world. By the time I wrote this down the little girl is probably dead. Such a brief span of life, of less than a decade and she is gone. Why did she come in the first place? For many people who do not know the Dhamma, it is difficult to accept.

A clear case of what can happen to you when you lack mindfulness. The venue of that accident is a Chinese temple in Malacca by the name of Miao Yin Si, literally meaning monastery of wondrous sounds. It has been known to house spinsters who have devoted all their lives to vegetarianism and reciting the name of omitofo , or Amitabha Buddha, in the hope of rebirth in the Maha- yanist’s Pure Land. The shrine proper, an elon- gated octagon, was completed in 1967. But another photograph dates the movement back to 1958. I was told that there used to be between 40 and 50 inmates at one time but now there are only four left, including a younger caretaker. There would have been five inmates, but for one who died five weeks ago. When I arrived, another was away and so there were only three. Actually, about 10 years ago, I came here to hold a four-day meditation retreat. Little has changed since then. This time I was staying for a longer period and so had more time to observe these old maids."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"106 All I can say after a week of study is that they are quite pathetic. It’s not that they do not have enough to eat. Besides, they also have a roof over their heads. It’s the meaninglessness of their existence that is glaring. The only one with spirit in her is our “Evening Horror”. One day while talking to her, I discov- ered that she actually knew my grandparents. Of grandma, she described her correctly as the lady with white hair who got along very well with the nurses and sisters. “Evening Horror” was herself a seamstress there at that time. “...And that old man, he gets upset whenever his wife gives birth to a girl instead of a boy! We all laughed at him for that,” she added. A small world indeed. As for the others, I cannot say much. There’s one inmate who often moves up and down the veranda, and besides having the support of a walking stick, she also hangs on to a mop. She is the one who does not eat in the kitchen like the others. One day I happened to see her opening her room’s door, and oh my goodness! I saw what was better not seen. ...oh, what a clutter of tin cans and other things we call rubbish! Then there is the one with waxy eyes and a dis- tant, vacant look. She moves about slowly and greets us once in a while. Of her, the caretaker warned, “Do not underestimate her, she can be violent.”"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"107 It’s only when the drum thunders for the evening prayers that the strength of what was to be their faith comes back to life. But the old ladies are too old to engage in the daily chant- ing. It’s “Evening Horror” who usually hits the drum. “That I can do; all I have to do is to chant omitofo when I bang the drum,” she said. That night I saw her sitting down – gasp- ing and panting – after a session. Well, theirs is a world where the light is fast dimming. There was an air of sadness about it as I saw one of them tending to the ancestral tablets of those gone before them. Maybe they are resigned to the fact that life has nothing more to offer, and that they think they may be better off joining their deceased inmates. This is despite whatever grievances they may have harboured before. One day, while venturing into a room, there arose a strong stench of decaying flesh. Maybe some of them are still around. Just maybe. Wouldn’t it be much better if they were to learn Insight Meditation or any form of meditation seriously so that even their last breath may be nobly observed? I did try to tell “Evening Hor- ror” a bit about it and even showed her some simple techniques in walking meditation, and she seemed respectful. But I think what I did was simply insufficient to hit the message home."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"108 2. Youth and Old Age During the meditation retreat, especially the nightly talks, I noticed a number of young peo- ple. Their youthful faces and behaviour seemed completely out of place here. They were like flower buds cast onto rotten trash. And yet, to think that the old ladies in this temple were once like that, is something worth reflecting. Now reflecting on myself, time seems to really fly as age advances. A year is already nearing the end and I have hardly noticed what has happened. So many things that I have wanted to do, I seem to keep postponing them. Soon, I’ll have to shuffle and drag my feet along, just like them and look so horrible that you might well call me “Venerable Horror.” But at least I think that my faith in the practice will remain as thunderous as those drum beats until I die. As for the young people, I certainly hope that they will make full use of their youth- ful strength while they can. All the while, when I was observing these old folks, one verse kept coming back to mind. There was an occasion when the Venerable Ananda saw the Buddha seated, warming his back in the sun. Thereupon, he commented on the ageing state of the Buddha’s body, “...It’s a wonder that the Exalted One’s skin is no longer clear and translucent and how all his limbs are slack and wrinkled, his body bent forward and"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"109 a change is to be seen in his sense faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue and body!” The Buddha replied, “So it is Ananda. Old age is by nature inherent in youth, sickness in health and death in life...” Finally the Buddha uttered two verses on old age: “ Shame on you , contemptible old age ! Age that makes colour fade , The pleasing image of man By age is trampled down . Although one should live a hundred years , All end up in Death , Nothing can avoid it , It tramples over everything .” It would indeed be appropriate that these verses be put up in the old folks’ homes to arouse the sense of urgency in young people who visit them.

In silence and calmness, you may be surprised how many issues previously considered inextri- cably entangled can be so easily resolved. It was on such a walk, though not alone, that I discussed with some friends what poem one can come up with in such a situation. The above poem was what came to mind. I do not think I had resolved anything at that time, simply because there wasn’t anything I could think of. As for: “florets that benumb the lips”, I was referring to a herb that grows wild by the road- sides. Mr. Kwan picked one up to let me taste. A bite at the flower and the lips and tongue went numb.

No, it’s not true that all people cannot be changed for the better through meditation. From experience, a great many have undergone much psychological improvement, although for many others, it may take a bit of time. Anger, the grossest of defilements, should be the first to go, followed by greed and then delusion. But to be rid of them completely, it will need much more time for most people. Patience is then the name of the game. It depends on the progress of meditation, which then depends on two factors – the potential already built up in one’s past lives and the degree of defilements present. The first is a matter of human resource, the other is a matter of human failings. After that, it is the right method, the effort made and the time to practise. What about faith? That comes under human resource. Generally, with observation, it"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"142 is not difficult to judge the extent of each factor.

In oil palm estates, they are welcomed as they act as a bio- logical control for the rat population. Some- times the estate workers would build little huts for them to breed in.

But they sometimes perch on a branch of the fig tree outside my window. I was told that they make strange noises too difficult to describe. After hearing them, I would classify them as screeches. They also hoot, although the manager swears that the Barn Owls don’t. So maybe it was another type of owl. However, I’m sure Barn Owls are not the only species found here. There’s a larger type that heaves and groans like an asthmatic patient. Just by the sound of it, one may think it’s a ghost breathing down your neck. From afar, I can see that it is quite large, with many dark stripes. When I tried to look closer at it, it also moved a bit as if trying to get a better view of me.

I also noticed that they sometimes perched on the branch just outside the window and peeped in curiously. In the second case, I was rubbing some oint- ment on a sprained shoulder.

That monk gives up the cycle of existence as the snake sheds its old, decayed skin.” Botanists will, however, say that figs do have flowers. They are neatly hidden in the structure which will become the fruit. They come under the plant family of Moraceae, which has a wide range of growth forms and habitats. One form is that of the strangling fig. This usu- ally grows as a fair to large-sized tree which"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"151 has many roots that grow from its trunk and branches. Its unique habit is that it may start its life cycle on the branches of some tall forest tree, then wrap its masses of roots over the host-tree, finally strangling it to death. The host trunk would then become its trunk and later rot away, leaving a mass of roots with a hollow central column. The Bodhi tree, under which the Buddha was enlightened, and the Banyan tree, under which the Bodhisatta took his meal, belonged to this type. It has also played an important part in the religious culture of India. Even in our coun- try, it is taken to be the abode of spirits, and so it is not unusual to find someone worshipping at its foot. The two trees described in the poems also come under this category. The first one is obviously a Ficus Benjamina. It must be around 30-40 feet high. The second one, I think (if I have not identified it wrongly) is a Ficus Caulocarpa. This one must be around 80ft – as high as it is wide. Hence, the comparison of this tree’s char- acteristic with a physical attribute of the Buddha – the Blessed One’s height was also equal to the width between his two out- stretched arms. We were told that when the trees are in their fruiting season, many wild birds will flock here to feast on its fruits.

As usual, they have not spared any of the original vegetation and what is left now are some miserable fruit trees planted far apart, hemmed in by “lalang” grasses. In afternoons such as these, the blaz- ing sun beats down harshly to make life more than miserable, and if you are sick, you can expect the worst. Near the door we could hear the moans and groans of an old lady in pain, “Aiyah... Aiyooh...” “Is this what sorrow is?” I asked my friend again. My friend, Animmitta, has in the past month or so, been helping to ferry a certain Dr. Lim (who"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"162 doesn’t, for some reason, believe in driving himself) to see patients, usually cases written off and sent home to wait for their inevitable exit from this existence. Dr. Lim graduated from Taiwan and has a teaching hospital there. Seeing the unstable situation in that country, he had decided to return to his homeland – Kuching, Sarawak. Here, he was appalled by the poor state of medical services and as a result, set upon himself to improve it. He has ideas of roping in teams of doctors from Taiwan and setting up a private hospital in Kuching itself. So far, the progress has been favourable. Let’s hope he succeeds. It so happened that on this day, I was around when they were called on to attend to a case of an old lady in her eighties. The hospital quotes her as suffering from: TB (?), Malignancy – none. With her lungs filled with liquid, they sent her home saying there’s nothing more they could do for her; go home and... Since then, the doctor had taken upon himself to attend to what he called a hopeful case. After giving her the drips, medications and so forth, she had recovered to the point where she could sit up, talk and be quite happy. That was three days ago and now, they are calling for help. As for what happened next, the poem more or less narrates it."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"163 As I watched her gasping, memories of my crit- ical time back in Lahad Datu flooded back. There, I was gasping like she did. Even as I decided to let go and die, it wouldn’t. Instead, excruciating pains pounded onto the brains. At those moments, a second was like a million years. But then, even if those around under- stood, what could they do? Well, being around definitely helps... even if you can’t do anything to relieve the physical pain; you can relieve mental agony. Dr. Lim, I noticed, was in his element. These things, he says, he has done a thousand times. You can see him moving around doing his part plus the nurses’ part (if they were there) confi- dently. At moments such as these, the doctor is the captain of the ship. Such is the worthiness of knowledge and experience. Without him, you can imagine the confusion. It was surprising how quickly the change of events took place. One moment she seemed well, the next moment things took a plunge. This was the first time I saw someone giving another the CPR (cardio pulmonary resuscitation). This was also the first time I sat there fanning someone at the moment of her death.

After awhile, I stopped when I thought it was as much as I could do. O yes, Sorrow has not yet left the house. Life goes on. As for the visions, they are mental images that flashed in and out. Being sceptical about such things, I usually ignore them. But this time it was interesting and came about in a way beyond my expectations. So, I recorded them in the poetry to add interest.

Sometimes newcomers arrive in disappoint- ment, wondering if either one of these could be the hermitage they have heard about. The first one is inhabited by a family with the surname “Tham,” who own their land which was origi- nally, and is to some extent still covered by rubber trees from which they earn their income. The one most familiar to us is Ah Kow. “Kow,” I learnt means “9”, unlike some people calling their children “Kow”, meaning “dog” in Chinese, with the belief that it can divert evil spirits from taking away their son in youth. The “Tham” family members are what you can call very earthy people. They live off the land and are also often covered by earth. Even their children would run bare-footed very naturally and freely over rocks and stones. From what I learnt, the family had two mothers.

So, when I was nicer to them, she and her son would come more often and sit longer. Secondly, she would always bring along with her a large company of mosquitoes.

Even if we had not been extremely close, at least our relationship was congenial. We should at least be grateful that they allowed us free passage through their land all these years. A nice thing was that every time we passed by their doorway, they would wave and smile, a fine greeting before and after the hermitage. Just this morning while passing by their house again, we were told that she had died in the mid- dle of the night. It seems that she had not been well for the past two months. Now that she is gone and the sound of death-ceremonies echoed into my room, I thought I felt a bit sad. Had she had more faith, she would have gained much.

I had just arrived the night before in Kuala Lumpur to hold a retreat and so was available to contact the right people to con- duct the final rites according to Buddhist ritu- als, which was simple, neat, practical as well as meaningful. As to this ceremony, I must thank the Sri Lankan monks, especially Ven. Sara- nankara of Sentul temple, and Ven. Vijita of Brickfields temple who came for chanting. Ven. Mahinda also gave an inspiring Dhamma talk to my family although I was not there at that time. I must also thank Mrs. Tan Teik Beng who so efficiently contacted the relevant people. Finally also to all the Buddhist friends who found the time to be supportive at this solemn occasion. She died just before 3.00pm on Sunday, 7th January. She had been rendered invalid for the last two years by Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. The doctor said she probably died of old age. My sister-in-law who had been attend- ing to her said she had difficulty in eating and was not well in the last few hours. Other than that, there were no obvious signs.

I can remember vividly the little square window of the furnace. The flames leapt up licking hun- grily at the gold-painted coffin. A dramatic end- ing to a body of someone who had lived 79 years on earth. An end to a tale of tales which I have been part of. Just think of the thoughts, emo- tions, and all the play in her world that stretched from Singapore, Southern China and finally, Malaysia. Surely this song of the final flames is a deserving conclusion. The bones we collected the following day were of an unusually pretty rich pink colour.

But burdened by a lot of worldly responsibilities or missionary undertak- ings, one cannot help but think of the nobler task of striving.

What I knew was what little I remembered about the things I had learned in school. Even when the proposed trip to Blue Mountains was planned, I did not do any research into it. After all, I thought, it will be a one-off affair. My main rea- son for going there was: I wanted to know what it is like to teach westerners. The least I could do was to try my best to earn my keep. Other than that, all else is superfluous. I was in for a pleasant surprise. What struck me most about the trip was how little I knew about Australia, and from what I found out, I liked it. The obvious question that follows will be, why? Firstly, space. Australia is a big country or more correctly, a continent. The population is relatively small and so we can find a lot of land and space. This is evident in its cities. For instance, the actual city centre of Sydney is not that big as compared to some Asian cities like Bangkok or New Delhi. Yes, it is modern, clean and beautiful, but not that big. What is big are the sprawling suburbs. Here everyone, well, almost everyone can afford a house with a com- pound if he makes some effort. The result is miles and miles of suburban quarters.

I met this couple back in Kota Tinggi and Kuala Lumpur many years ago. Since then, I only knew that they had migrated to Australia. What a pleasant surprise it was to see old friends again. But this was only the beginning. In the course of time, I discovered many other old friends who had migrated here. Blue Mountains Insight Meditation Centre cer- tainly did not look at all impressive in the lousy print-out published in a newsletter which Don- ald had sent me earlier. This was another pleasant surprise. It is actually a very quiet, cosy and beautiful place. The only thing is that it may be a bit small for a large crowd of yogis. About 20 would still be fine, but more than that would be crowded. The weather during the first two days was rainy and cold. I had the heater on for many hours of the day. But when the sun finally came out, I had begun to marvel at the beauty of the place. If this is what English gardens are about, then they are pretty things. The garden of the centre was sufficient to entertain me for some time. First of all, there’s a huge cypress tree, the largest I have seen so"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"214 far. Then there are the hazelnuts, walnuts, apples, and so forth. Being interested in botany since my varsity days, you can imagine the thrill. I had read or seen pictures of these, but now they are an experience. Then there are the natives. To see more of these, one does not have to go far. A short 5-minute walk will take you to a catchment area where there stretches, for many square kilometres, the Australian bush. In fact, a large part of the Blue Mountains is a national park. For the weeks that followed, it provided me with feast after feast of botanical pleasure. During my stay, I got acquainted with Ian of Katoomba. They told me that in matters of plants (with their botanical names included), he was the one I would have to speak to. I was not disappointed. Besides trees, he also has great affinity with wildlife. It seems that when- ever he goes for a bush trek, he is sure to come across wildlife. On one occasion, sure enough, we encountered a Lyre Bird. Ian told me that a large percentage of the plants in Australia came from three families – Myrtaceae, Proteaceae and Mimosaceae. What intrigued me most were the Eucalypts. It seemed to me that they made up most of the trees that covered the Blue Mountains. I was also informed that there are somewhere between 600-700 species in the Mountains. I"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"215 bought a book on them and it tells you quite a bit with lots of pretty photographs. In the field, however, they all looked quite the same. Well, the bark can be white and peeled, stringy, rough, etc, but did that make up over 600 types? Of course, the flower and fruit structure of these Eucalyptus can also be unique, but you get to see them only when they are in bloom. I guess knowledge of their distribution is crucial to identification. I have learnt to love Eucalypts, although not right from the start. To begin with, I thought them rather eerie-looking. Ribbons of bark would peel and hang untidily all over the place. The exposed trunks are often white and ghostly-looking. The leaves dangle down, often quite scanty. But just wait till you see a large specimen towering over a hundred or more feet high and you will also be impressed. Then you will find that you have begun to recognise some of them although they may at first look very much alike. Finally I have come to think of the Eucalypts as the basic plant element of Aus- tralia itself. The best of all species is, of course, Eucalyptus Regnans, the king of them. We saw them during the trip with Wendy. They even labelled the tallest one in the state of Victoria – 275ft, if not for a storm that knocked off part of the canopy, it would have been 305ft. Being among them one can feel so much peace and calm. Nature is calming, healing and this is what many of us must learn."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"216 There’s one thing about the people here – they are very concerned about Nature conservation. Here they are trying to get rid of what was introduced and replace them with the natives. So you get some people who are obsessed with chopping down pines which tend to prevent the natives from establishing themselves. Once I saw an old lady frantically pulling out the Spanish broom, a lovely plant with yellow blooms that have invaded the country and pushed the natives out. On looking around, I saw the whole place infested with these. I also wonder how much of it she can get rid of. Most people I have met also know how to appreciate wildlife, and speak proudly of what is unique to their country – kangaroos, koala bears and so forth. In the wild, I have come across the koala bear in Lismore and the Lyre Bird in the Blue Mountains. The Kookaburra can be found inhabiting places where people feed them, and I have seen them in Sydney itself. At Blackwoods, we can actually feed them off our hands. When men do not harm animals, they will actually come in close con- tact with men. In Malaysia, they usually keep their distance. Once I tried to build a bird- feeder, and all that came were ants. I have also been asked about animals in Malaysia, I answered: “Oh yes, we have tigers, elephants, wild boars, cobras, pythons, etc.” Secretly, I thought to myself that we do not consider it fortunate to have seen some of these in the wild, for we may not survive to narrate it. So"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"217 when a westerner comes around and says he wishes to visit our jungles, we think he is crazy. In Australia, they will take you there even if you don’t ask. Bush walking is not just a pastime here, it has become a culture. I have not been to all parts of Australia, but the Blue Mountains is a great place to do bush walking. The area is big and there are many trails. We were taken to a few, such as to the Mini Ha Ha Falls, the Canyon walk, and a short distance of the Wentworth Falls trail. The land- scape and vegetation are all quite similar; there are panoramic lookouts into the grand canyons of the southern hemisphere, dramatic water- falls, rugged cliffs, tall trees, unique vegetation and so forth. Most of all, the walk was invigor- ating after being cooped up indoors during the cold days. The invitation I received from Australia required me to hold a 10-day retreat besides some public talks, including one at the Bud- dhist Library concerning death and the dying process. The retreat allowed me to have an idea of how these westerners take to meditation and whether or not I am able to communicate with them. As the participants were “sieved” to some extent, all of them were very reasonable and diligent yogis. But there are some characteris- tics that are different from our Malaysian yogis, not that they were unexpected. The first is that"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"218 they are individualistic. They keep to them- selves their own private lives and are not in the habit of washing dirty linen in public as some of our people tend to do. But I am surprised that quite a number of them have anger kept within themselves. They are not without dis- tress. It seemed to me that it is unacceptable to show anger, even the slightest bit and so, to a great extent it seemed suppressed. This had led me to teach Metta (loving-kindness) meditation and it not only worked, it was also very well received. Again, concerning the individualistic character of the people here, I found myself giving the talks as a form of guided meditation. In this way I felt I was talking to them, and they seemed to like it. There is also a need to give thorough theoretical information whenever necessary. Most of these people are highly liter- ate and so intellectual satisfaction was needed to arouse faith. I gave a few talks to this effect, such as “concept and reality”, “concentration and insight”, and I wondered if they under- stood what I had meant to say. Obviously they did and they progressed in their meditation. So it seemed to me that the content of the talk and their command of English played important parts in the retreat, more than these factors did in Malaysia. Back home here, many are not very literate, and often emotional counselling during interviews is required before the actual practice comes into play."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"219 So as I see it, I like teaching in Australia, only because the number of yogis is much less. But this is fine, as it allows more time for more thorough interviews, prepare talks, exercise and do my own meditation. Byron Bay and Lismore The mere mention of Byron Bay brought excite- ment to Australians I met. When I asked, why, a lady just replied, “Well, because it is Byron.” Another said it was because it is warm. Byron Bay is obviously loved because of the sea. Surf- ing is a favourite sport there, and hang gliding is also popular. All in all, it’s a place to have sports, fun and relaxation. We were invited there to give some talks and hold a one-day retreat. The area, it seems, was and still is the centre of Hippyism. It was these people that sought after philosophies and ways of life that the West has now grown accustomed to. As a result, it was also they who took up Buddhism. When we arrived, we stayed at Lismore, a short distance from the resort-bay, at the home of Malcolm Huxley. When we arrived, Nissy, another active Buddhist member in the area, picked us up at the airport with a limousine, used for funeral purposes! She, we soon got to know, is a funeral director in Lismore. A number of interesting things also happened to us here, just to quote a few..."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"220 1. When I was about to give a talk at the Byron Bay community centre, I nearly laughed aloud. Before me sat what looked to me like a circus performance group in fancy dress. They were in all sorts of outfits and hairstyles. I had to con- tain myself a lot! A couple of these types of peo- ple actually came to attend the one-day retreat. They were very nice and reasonable people. Never judge a person by the looks! 2. Another incident was more surprising than hilarious. At the beach one morning, a man came up, shook my hand and said, “I believe in what you are doing.” He also added that he had seen me on television and in Time maga- zine. Just as I was wondering what that was about, I came to find out that he thought I was the Dalai Lama! I do not look like him and I certainly do not have his compassion and so I was thoroughly confused. I only added that we come from the same Buddhist family, so as not to disappoint him. It seemed that Tibetan Bud- dhism has made a great impact in the West. Very often I have been asked, “Are you from Nepal? Tibet?” When I said that I was from Malaysia, they seemed unable to relate. There is however one more interesting episode that happened in the Blue Mountains. On a visit to the Jenolan Caves, the guide there com- mented on the purity of the underground river and that it was their source of drinking water. When I asked if there was any danger posed to health, especially with the high content of cal-"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"221 cium from the limestone, she merely replied with a big “NO.” “There are people who have been drinking it for years and nothing wrong has happened to them. In fact, it may do you some good, such as, make your hair grow,” she said. At this point, she actually reached out to stroke my head. I ducked in time! 3. After seeing people surfing and hang-gliding for the first time in my life, it occurred to me that Australians will have their own similes and examples to draw from to explain points in the Dhamma. Usually, I will use struggling, sailing and flying to illustrate the three levels of concentration. The first is the struggle for con- centration. When one can effortlessly keep the mind to the object, the flow of the concentrated mind will then be like sailing. When one really goes higher, the mind uplifts itself (or really sinks in), then it is like flying. In Australia, the examples will instead have to be bush walking, surfing and hang-gliding. In New Zealand it will be trekking, sailing and bungee jumping! 4. One day, and I think it was the final day in Lismore, we had a very rare opportunity, taking into account the Australian conditions, to visit the morgue. When we were there, one of Mal- colm’s patients (or late patient) whom he had counselled, met with an accident and died. His body was in the morgue and Nissy asked if we would like to come along to see it. To show us around the place was the manager, Mr. David, who said he liked his job. He sure sounded like"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"222 he did. And not only that, he spoke well and was experienced. He showed us all the works. “This is the bag we bring them in from the hospital... This is the compound we use to embalm the body... This is the iron suction rod we use to suck up dirty fluids and gas from the abdomen... This is the liquid we use to disinfect the body... here, try it” at that point I shrunk away, although others took it into their hands. “This is the eye support, the mouth support for the corpse to prevent the sinking of the eyes... Here take a look,” and he placed them in my hands. Wow! He’ll make a good salesman for the para- phernalia needed to embalm and make up a corpse. He also aims to make good the business. When we looked at the corpses, they were just empty shells. One old lady who had just passed away, looked like she was asleep. Deprived of the Chinese stuffs of paper money and paper clothes, cymbals, large coffins, wail- ing, etc, they don’t look eerie. In the clean and air-conditioned room there was nothing fright- ening. But still there was heaviness in the air."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"223 When I asked Nissy, who has been working with the dead and dying for a long time, if the people of the deceased feel sad, she answered: “Very.” So, Australians also die, feel sad and cry! That’s how I got to write the poem, “Death in Australia.” Melbourne Our visit to Melbourne was included later when we found out that Wendy was returning to Aus- tralia and was enthusiastic in inviting us over. I managed to squeeze out 5 days and they were wonderful 5 days. We stayed at her parents’ house and during that period, we visited the Healesville Sanctuary for Australian wildlife, as well as the “Big Trees.” The sanctuary is actually a kind of a zoo with an open concept like the one in Singapore. See- ing these animals made me think of the mean- ing of existence. These animals, I assume, don’t think about such things. They just eat, sleep, play and reproduce. Being caged up doesn’t make things happier, although it may increase the chances of survival for their species in the future. The “Big Trees” belonged to the Eucalyptus Regnans species. One such tree was once the tallest in the world, well over 100m high. It was"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"224 chopped down and now the highest is a Red- wood in California. While trying to locate the Big Trees, we got lost for a while. The map wasn’t quite complete. Then there was the fog. When we finally walked among them, I felt like I was walking in an ancient place. Although the trees were really tall, their trunks were not as massive as the Sequoias of California. But then, aren’t they just as fantastic? I always feel I should spend more time living among them, just the same way as we just pop in on the holy spots during a pilgrimage. Blackwoods Wendy took us to her brother’s cabin for a weekend hideout in Blackwoods, some hours drive from Melbourne. Blackwoods, which was once a mining town, is now a small community with a handful of shops. Mostly, they are cot- tages. The cabin is at the edge of a forest park and has a stream running nearby. A few Kookaburras that live here come to be fed when there are people around. During our stay, we looked around the place, which included the lovely Garden of St Erth with a short trek nearby, the trek on which the “Duck” tripped and injured his wing, the cemetery with its short history, some nurseries, and that’s about all. After spending two nights in this place, I decided to spend sometime meditating here as suggested.

It is not unlike Mother’s or Father’s Day when you shower them with kisses and presents, except that you offer your mouth, wide-opened with teeth exposed, for the dentist to fix. Dentistry, it seemed to me, has advanced with giant steps. Not so, my dentist disagreed. According to him, the idea remains very much the same. What has improved with time was the technology. As he spoke, he used an instru- ment that flicks free a bridge that has been fit- ted too tightly. “Wow!” I exclaimed, “You seem to have an instrument for everything.”"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"227"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"228 He giggled as he related how one dentist actu- ally pulled out the tooth while trying to remove a bridge which was fitted too tightly. It seemed the inexperienced dentist used the pliers. Another patient, he said, was apprehensive that he might dislodge his gums. He had to reassure his patient that he knew what he was doing. That similar thought, I recollected, did pass through my mind. As far as I can remember, a visit to the dentist did not frighten me, at least not as much as most whom I know. My first dentist, as I recall, was our pig-tailed amah. To extract my decay- ing milk tooth, she tied the tooth to one end of a string while with the other end, she fixed it to a door knob. Slam! Out comes the tooth, and strangely enough, there was very little pain. One of my first visits to the dentist was at school. It was a nurse who took care of mat- ters. I went up to her and requested that she sewed up my tooth. “We don’t sew up teeth,” she corrected me. “Then mend it.” I retorted. “Mend it?” She laughed again. I can’t remember what followed, but the next thing I recalled was, there I was, in the chair. She took out the pliers, gripped the molar and pulled. As she pulled and pulled, I was literally"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"229 pulled out of the chair, dragged to a sink until my back leaned against it. With one of her legs, she fixed me in that convenient position which at the same time, served as a leverage. Then, she extracted the tooth. Little Soonie Horner Was dragged to a corner By his school nurse with a pair of pliers And as she stretched out her legs on him She pulled with her strong arms , his tooth Then said , what a good boy he was ! As I grew up I went to a lady dentist to fix any tooth decay that I had. She must have been just a registered dental practitioner because when I finally went to a qualified one, she said my teeth was not properly disinfected during the filling. On further thinking, I had to agree, because at times it was her daughter that did the job, and she must have been in her early teens. What made me keep going back there must have been the cheaper rate! Having to dish out money seemed to be more frightening than the pain. I can also recall that utter embarrassment when I did not have enough money with me. I had to apologise to the den- tist and promised to return with the balance. At the varsity, we had a dentist. Only one to handle all the students. As a result, you have to wait for months for an appointment. Your tooth would have totally rotted by then. So I would make an appointment whether or not I"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"230 needed it. At least it will then be a check up. And after that I will immediately make another appointment. This particular dentist was an Indian lady. Fat was the description of her. Motherly was another adjective to describe her. While fixing my teeth, she would place my head between her breasts and fiddle with things in my mouth. At first I was embarrassed, but after a while, I felt comfortable. She must have been overworked, because, at one time she started rattling away... “You should complain to your student union about the lack of dentists provided for the stu- dents...” I totally sympathised with her, but I felt guilty because I was the sort of person who was very unconcerned about student unions, and all I wanted was to get my degree. Being a monk did not exempt me from tooth decay or the dentist, but it had helped me han- dle the situation better. Be mindful, don’t panic, and also don’t note the pain if you don’t have to. If you have to, make sure you’re really detached . Usually I would fix my mind onto a visualised circle of light, the light kasina, which is not unlike the full moon. One such occasion was in Myanmar. There they have good doctors but not the technology."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"231 I suppose the same goes for the dentists as well. However, I also suppose that not all of them are that skilled. At the Mahasi Centre, I was suffering from a terrible tooth ache. The dentist on service at that time could not detect any defect and so attributed it to the gums. She did some scaling of the plaque, but the pain persisted. Then I wondered if it might be my wisdom tooth growing. On my next visit – this time it was a doctor – he said that it could not possibly be so. “Wisdom teeth” he said, “grow only on the lower gums, not the upper.” After a while I proved the doctor wrong. My other friend fared worse. He told the dentist or doctor that he had “holes” in his tooth and by rights, it should be attended to. But then there were no such facilities there, and so the doctor dismissed him with a few panadols . As the pain persisted, I noted and noted but it still became unbearable. I finally resorted to pain killers, that unassuming panadol again. It worked for sometime but finally, it too, was no longer effective. With sufficient encouragement from the teacher, it came to a point as if the tooth exploded into many, little hard bits, and after that, it troubled me no more. The wisdom tooth, it seemed, had stopped growing."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"232 Since then, I have been to quite a few dentists. One even requested me to tell him about medi- tation while attending to my teeth. He would first asked a question and then before I could utter more than a word, he would quickly fit something into my mouth. I think it is a lousy way of making one forget the ordeal. Another dentist I met recently in Kuching has the most modern clinic I have ever been to. It looked like a 21st century clinic, the space age type; together with an all-glass wall with a good view of a city corner. He even went on to edu- cate me about the toxicity of mercury fillings, how to brush one’s teeth and even the history of dentistry. Before I finally came to Dr. Tan, I used to go to a doctor in Petaling Jaya. But that was too far away, and I am seldom there now. Dr. Tan has so far won my trust and that is whom the poem is about. He said, “every tooth is precious, and should be saved.” Obviously, the one extracted was beyond redemption.

This is because the mental sufferings encountered can be very exhausting, and if one is not careful, one may end up somewhat depressed. At that point, concentration falls. I use the contempla- tion of peace (Upasamanussati) to bring in the purpose, peace and therefore concentration. After that, the meditation will go on for some- time.

We needed to take a ferry to cross over. There we took up an invitation from Mark Parishian to sail on his boat The Prelude . This incident taught me an interesting lesson, and that is, how one can go into concentration while on the move. When I asked him what joy he gets from sailing, he answered, “peaceful- ness”. After experiencing it once, I knew he was correct. Unlike the motor boats where a din usually accompanies, this type is silent except for the gurgling of the waters, the beating of the wind on the flapping sails, and the dreamy glide of the boat as lights play reflections on your eyes. If you can keep a silent awareness, then the concentration sets in easily. Having caught the concentrated state of mind in move- ment, I think one can bring it to any moving situation.

Water is the source of life, and pure waters do mean health- ier living. In the spiritual sense we always relate back to the mind. Pure water will mean pure thoughts and pure feelings. They make up a happier life. In this sense, Queenstown is basically sensual where people are here for a good time. Some meditation and Dhamma knowledge should do well to balance it.

Wendy arranged a retreat for a small group in Melbourne. We spent nine days peace- fully meditating at a retreat centre called “The Amarant”, located in the hills to the east of the city. The place is quiet, surrounded by regener- ated bush. There are two main walking trails in the property, one zig zags uphill to a look-out which they call “vision corner”, another goes down the hill to where there grows a tree which the owners took pride in, and which they call “The golden tree”. It is definitely a Eucalyptus and of a fair size. It has beautiful brown bark that peels out to expose a lighter orangish-grey trunk. Three trunks rise from a short base. It seems to stand out from the rest of the bush and is quite pretty. Other than that, I do not see anything more special about it, but the owners think of it as something spiritual.

Greg is someone I met when I first went to Burma about 17 years ago. Since then, he had become a monk, returned to lay life and now intends to return to that contemplative life again. He tells me that he lived here during his youth, and the bed he slept on is the one at the level just above my bed. During his teens he helped the care- taker here to plant the trees in the property. As he walks around trying to locate those trees and commenting on their growth, I was more inter- ested in watching his nostalgia. Greg has much similarity with me. He loves trees and he loves to plant those big ones. He also took up a course in botany. When I told him that I also like to plant big trees and have already done quite a bit in Kota Tinggi, it made me wonder if the same thing would happen to me when I have left the place and return after many years. What is this feeling of nostalgia? Recalling the past brings up feelings. All those years that have gone by made us what we are now. We have grown older but are we any wiser? The Dhamma has helped each of us to grow in our own way from our own unique roots. Then those feelings come with an almost exquisite joy. Later, alone in the room, I commented that he was still very much a monk inside. He turned around and said that when he disrobed, he thought he had lost everything, but obviously he hasn’t.

But, these worlds, real or otherwise, I know, are mind trails and mindscapes. Why does Gabriel come beside my bed With a smirk on his lips? Why does Lord Shiva appear in my dreams, Trident in hand, rock torso, stoned face?

On this trip to Australia, I took up Alan’s invitation to visit him and to find out if it’s true, although I did not expect to do so with a small entourage. He must have been trying very hard to com- plete his new house so that he may at least be able to accommodate us. When we reached his place it was still in quite a mess. When auntie Tay came out of the car, she asked, “Do you mean we are getting down here?” We, more or less, spent the rest of the day cleaning it up to make it more habitable. After that it was just filling up the place with laughter. The most important thing for a guest to feel at ease is to know that one is welcome and not imposing. As to this, I can say Alan’s heart is much bigger than most people’s houses. Tasmania is like New Zealand with an Austral- ian setting. There are fields with sheep and cat- tle, perhaps a little bit less, and the arboreal content still consists of a great extent of gums. Population wise, it is relatively sparse other than around Hobart and, life is slow. An ideal place to settle down to personal spiritual life. One evening, seated outside his house, facing the grove of stringy barks, I told him it’s amaz- ing that I’m now in Tasmania, a place I never imagined I’d come.

For a time, I thought them as a tool to learn the English language. With age, I discover the subtlety of the wisdom hidden in it. For example, there is the nursery rhyme on Humpty Dumpty, a jolly egg of a fellow who, due to carelessness, fell off the wall and could not be put back together again even with the help of all the king’s men – a lesson in mindful- ness! There is also the one on the horse shoe nail, the loss of which finally accounted for the loss of a war. Then there is another on the little acorn, which little by little grew into a huge oak tree. Here we have the lesson of patience – for even great things have to start small... and fragile. That is just what the miracle of a seed is about. Within that little thing, is stored all the data of its future growth, and with it, all the potential it carries. Science now recognises it as the blueprint found in the genes. Subsequent fertilisations bring about different combinations, while muta- tions add variations within the species. Exter- nal factors then select the fittest to survive."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"274 As I began to see some seedlings that I planted germinate, I lifted up their tender heads into the air, thinking of how these fragile little things will be when they grow into huge trees or shrubs with pretty flowers. Some, such as the basil, will be suitable for healthy consumption. But from experience, the mortality rate is high. The high humidity here fuels rapid fungal growth and hungry insects are also too happy to make them part of their menu. Only a small percentage make it to maturity. There are so many conditions to fulfil before a dream becomes a reality. Then my thoughts go to the kammic seeds we plant in life. Countless times we commit acts that are unwholesome. Can we do more whole- some deeds than those notorious deeds? In the many years that I have spent here, I reflected that I have indeed planted many seeds into people whom I have met. Fortunately, they are meditation seeds. Not many make much of it, valuable though they may be, but some have grown up somewhat. There is some satisfaction when I see the results – mindfulness “walking” in many parts of the country. It is also satisfy- ing to know that the seeds are also likewise found in my own mind.

Many years ago The same winds blew me off Away from my dear home And the world of paper chase, Blew away my hair, Blew away my clothes, Now it’s blowing me away From this place."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"276 But I don’t mind at all, For these winds blow in What I’ve been searching for, These winds blow in What I needed most, These winds blow in What I’m developing, These winds blow in Mindfulness, Mindfulness into the real nature of things. Severing ties of the heart is painful, Strangely, the same too, That bondage of duty, These are chains in the valley of senses, The Ego will forever refuse to give in. So let go, and go we must, No matter what others may say or feel, Listen to that brilliant jewel of the heart It speaks very clearly in the softest of voices, The duty to the spirit is foremost. 24 April 1997 Santisukharama , Kota Tinggi , Johor \u0001 Just the other day, my sister wanted to bring a friend here to see me. She said her friend needed some help. “For what?” I asked, and further added, “I hope you realise I’m not a psychiatrist.” “Not that, it’s on spiritual matters,” she answered."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"277 “Well, in that case....” At that point, my mind wandered into spiritual matters or rather, spirit matters. I wanted to tell her I’m also not an exorcist, but I held back. I did not want to be too presumptuous. Well, she turned out to be an extremely sane and fairly young, articulate lady, and from what I later learned, is also highly educated. Many traumatic and spiritual experiences happened only lately, about a year or two ago. It included the loss of a child and a near death experience. What is surprising is that she began to have experiences that are quite similar to vipassana experiences I had before I became a monk and finally renounced. She obviously understood the nature of the energy that pulsates in her body as part of and similar to that in the uni- versal existence. The rate of detachment seems to be picking up at a rate beyond her expecta- tions. She wanted some guidance. Well, I did what I could, explaining the neces- sity of mindfulness and the training of it. In my case, it cleared up all the matters soon after I took up the practice, and it should do much better on her. During that time I was already a Buddhist. The meditation I did was Ch’an. All those pulsating energies of mind and matter frequently ran through and I would lose the thought of an “I” completely.

Only when I dwelt upon the Vipassana tradition, that that structure of the system fell into place. Mindfulness clarifies! Just before she left she passed me some poems she wrote lately, poems that she wanted to share with me, and they were beautiful poems. Here, I shall put in two. I lay in the deepest of sleep With the waves of a thousand oceans over me Ebbing and flowing through the night I lay in the deepest of sleep I lay in the deepest of sleep When even the wind remained still And the stars broodily sent out their light I lay in the deepest of sleep I lay in the deepest of sleep When the moon was high And the sun blazed and glowed so bright I lay in the deepest of sleep I lay in the deepest of sleep When the mountains grew to their tremendous height And the earth trembled with all her might As the universe filled with wondrous delight I lay in the deepest of sleep .

This boy keeps a pain Beyond description, And yet he bears Trying to ignore The burden, Occasionally letting out a scream Of agony, There is fear, there is anger, There is despair, If you do not empty it, Drugs will numb you Into a zombie.

When tense, relax, When well, merits accumulate. 9 May 1997 Santisukharama , Kota Tinggi , Johor \u0001 We do meet, once in a while, people who are mentally unstable. The Dhamma speaks of dif- ferent causes of mental instability, some of which include demonic possession, Kamma, physical illness such as fever, wrong views and of course, an excess of defilements such as craving, anger and delusion. The result is then, that indescribable suffering, which I think is the worst form of suffering on Earth, a sort of a living hell. But the one I am talking about isn’t so bad, in the sense that he has not gone com- pletely raving mad. He is one that once too often tips off into something abnormal (aren’t we sometimes like that in a lesser degree?) and that is when you see the terror of a broken man. Usually some tablets that knock him off to sleep will do the job for the time being, and that is what we did, give him a few magic tab- lets. But that’s not the answer – the causes lay deep in his mind. That strange behaviour re- surges up again given the conditions. He knows it, but what can he do? Maybe he will get well with time, but that’s not what we can do for him here. This is a meditation centre, not a mental hospital. But it’s sad, because"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"282 they come across the Dhamma which they know is good, but are unable to embark on the most wonderful part called insight meditation. Time on the Move Time flips through numbers On the calendar sheets Time crawls between the lines That makes up your face Time rushes under the soles Of scurrying feet Time climbs onto tops Of growing trees But time stood still on the road as we rode along Froze all angles of the sun For me to choose The direction in the last laps Of my brief life on Earth To choose to fly alone Or to die with the herds My dream tells me emphatically That I should not delay the course Detour to sight-see a world That has always been the same So I cry for you, With tears of a crocodile I smile for myself A decent smile, A monkey of a smile."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"283 I have a choice, one choice, A beautiful choice 18 May 1997 Batu Pahat , Johor \u0001 This poem came up when I was on the road from Kota Tinggi to Batu Pahat to give talks. All in a Split of a Second It all happened in just a split of a second, That screech of rubber on rocks, That clash and thump of metals. Then flew an Indian man as his bike rolled along, A tumble and a scramble and I saw him licked his wounds. But somewhere behind the car, Another motorcycle laid in silence. Its rider, (how? It was just too fast) was thrown to the ground In the rear of the car. His body too lay silently, Just like his motorcycle, On the metal road, Face to one side, Eyes staring blankly. Even as the driver slowly walked to him, Tapped him gently on his shoulder, He lay there silently, Body soft and limp, Face to one side,"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"284 Eyes staring blankly. Is he dead? Is this how time seals up The man, his breath? All in a split of a second? 25 May 1997 Santisukharama , Kota Tinggi , Johor \u0001 The incident occurred shortly after my visit to the dentist, my yearly reminder of sufferings that come with the body, which fortunately did not come with too much. After paying a short visit to a friend, just at the junction, when Alan was waiting for his turn to cross the road, right in front of us, there was a bang and a screech. It was obvious that an accident had occurred. But it was just too fast, all in a split of a sec- ond. The next thing I saw was the Indian man thrown off his bike, made a brief scramble and seemed to escape relatively unhurt. But then, when I saw the driver, whose car’s rear was bumped, walk out, I also saw another bike trapped at the rear. When he tapped the shoul- der of the other man lying on the metal road, there was no response. The victim’s face was emotionless, eyes blank, body soft and limp. This was not the first time I saw something like this. There was a case which I saw many years ago in Penang. The motorcyclist, who must have been travelling at a considerable speed, was hit by a turning car. He was carrying a lady who, in turn, was cradling a baby. Shortly"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"285 after the screech and bang, the man with the crash helmet somersaulted in front of me. The helmet came off and his head was bloody. The lady flew and rolled at a tremendous speed fur- ther away towards the side. I can remember her face, eyes tightly closed as if determined to shut herself from what was happening. From her hands, the baby was flung off till it rolled right across the hard road, quicker than a foot- ball. All three of them made no sound. However, the worst that I heard of was a car that ran over a pregnant woman. The foetus came out as a result. The man who saw it decided to become a monk. I suppose this type of thing occurs everyday all across the world. People die, but does anyone really think about it? In this instant, it made me think with some compassion about the vic- tim. It also made me think of how it can all happen so very fast, all in a split of a second and how helpless most of us are then. Contrary to expectations, there are those that know exactly what happened during these brief but critical periods. A young friend of mine who once met with an accident reported his experi- ence to me. He said that from the moment he was thrown from his bike, it was like slow motion. He could feel and notice everything happening step by step. Even when he landed on the ground, he could hear the cracks of his bone in slow sequence. There was no pain and"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"286 fear then; they come later. The same was reported to me by my aunt who slipped in the bathroom. Fortunately, her head was saved when it landed onto the waste paper basket instead of the hard floor. But she suffered a leg fracture. All came in slow motion. Is it adrena- lin doing its work, or is it previous practice in meditation? Usually in life threatening situa- tions such as these, the alertness called up can be tremendous. Man had done feats usually unaccomplishable. If you have been meditat- ing, it would be stronger. There have been reports by yogis that the mindful noting that can arise by itself at that time can become even stronger than during retreats. The Day After After I have left Be happy for me For I have followed my heart Flown away with the winds For my Nature is such Empty and fleeting Be happy that I have left To be on Nature’s path After I have left And if you wish to find me Go to the forest Dark and deep For there is where I want to be And where I was meant to be"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"287 Deep in the forest Where trees grow tall Then, there at that very spot Where you stand If you wish to hear me Look up and listen To the rustlings of the leaves As the wind passes by In whispers or in cries What winds have to say Is also what I have in mind What has the world got to do with me? 15 June 1997 Place Unknown \u0001 I do not know if I will spend much time deep in the forest, but I will certainly try. At least it will be places like that – secluded and simple. Med- itation has always been on my mind, and it is what I live for, and there is no choice but to find such resorts. I am glad that after all these years in Kota Tinggi, I did not harbour any strong attach- ments to the hermitage or anybody. So also I did not leave in anger and sorrow. Even the trees that I planted and took much interest in were more of a sideline. Something to relax the mind in the midst of my teaching activities. I hope they will grow beyond my lifespan to great heights."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"288 Rather, I leave happily, having known I have done more than my part. Now, there lies before me what I want to do, and that is, to go into deeper private research in this field which I know will be most rewarding. Maybe after many years I will be able to share my findings of the more profound aspects of the Dhamma with my friends, if they are still around. This does make a good conclusion to this book with an appropriate title. Will there be a sequel to this? Go ask the winds. \u0001"}]
