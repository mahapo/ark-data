Today’s citizens are too independent and selfish to be ruled with gloved hands. is need not be so. People can still be treated humanely and we can still follow the principle that if you treat people well, they will behave well. Part of the reason why governments are so harsh today is that they op - erate from a point of view that the world is finite and that everything is real. We must remember that all the Buddha’s advice was given against a world view which is totally dif - ferent from the world view of a vast majority of humans today. If we want to effectively make use of the Buddha’s Teaching to promote social harmony and universal peace we must begin to see the world as the Buddha did. We must “see the world as it really is”. We must use all our efforts to give an understanding of the three characteristics of nicca (impermanence), ukkha (unsatisfactoriness) and natta (non-self). Admittedly this is a huge task.

But at the same time, technological and urban developments and westernization have moved ahead at dizzying speeds. e result: the aver - age Buddhist in a traditional Buddhist country (possibly with the exception of Japan) has become increasingly dis - o riented and there exists a vast gap within him, between his traditional values and his modern concept of the world with its banking systems, sensational entertainment, materialism, nuclear families and so on.

Real victory can only be attained by a true change of heart founded on understanding on the part of the aggressor. His Holiness the Dalai Lama truly believes in inculcating peace through non-violence. We are all familiar with the story of how during the time of the Buddha a prince called Vidudabha annihi - lated the entire Sakya clan simply because he harboured a grudge against them for a slight insult. We have to learn from that example and seek rather to follow in the footsteps of the great king whose name was changed from Chanda (cruel) Asoka to Dhamma (righteous) Asoka because he had the wisdom to walk the path shown by the Buddha. Let us also recall the Buddha’s declaration that the people of a certain kingdom could not be overcome by force be - cause they followed the seven conditions for the progress of a nation. ese examples show that war is avoidable if we truly wish it. ere is a principle of Modern Management today which declares that if we expect Zero Defects in our operations we will achieve them. Similarly if we envisage a society without war, we will achieve peace. Unfortunately we have been so indoctrinated to believe that war is the only way to get what we want, that we will continue to wage war. e most horrible irony of it is that people even"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"    wage wars in the name of religions which teach the brother- hood of man. erefore the greatest challenge facing us in the next millennium is to grow up, to stop fighting like small boys and heed the word of the Enlightened One All fear death, All fear the rod, Knowing this we should never strike Nor cause to strike. P e world today is divided by many factors. Sad to say one of the most important of the organizations responsible for these many divisions is religion. Today, perhaps like at no other time in history, are the vast resources of certain religious or - ganizations being exploited shamelessly in a mad scramble to win converts at any cost. ese include the spreading of malicious lies against other religions like Buddhism. Young, innocent impressionable people are being lured away from their traditional religion through blatant false propaganda"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"    and even through bribes. ere are instances of whole vil - lages in certain countries being converted en masse through the promise of material gain. Conversion in itself may not be a bad thing, but when methods employed and the mo - tives for converting are suspect then we must not stand idly by and do nothing about it. In many countries conversions which are not accom - panied by a full understanding of what is being accepted can lead to serious problems, often causing the breakup of mar - riages and families and other social problems. erefore it is not conversion but buying people. ere is therefore an urgent need for Buddhists to seek the dialogue with other religious groups to voice our dissatisfaction with their activities. ere are genuine mem - bers of these faiths who are themselves embarrassed by the antics of their fellow religionists. ey must speak against their own kind and Buddhists must make every effort to urge them to do so. In the past, traditional religions were the victims of colonial missionaries. Today, the problem is much more insidious — citizens of the same country are working to undermine the traditional cultures and prac - tices of their forefathers and introducing alien ways to their people, separating parents and children, the old and the young."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"    E On a more positive note, however, Buddhists have always been encouraged, in the K S for exam ple, to seek dialogue with others to show respect for other genuine seekers after the truth. We need to talk with other religionists formally and informally to know how they think, to show them how we think and to find common ground on which we can cooperate to work for the betterment of the human race. In some cases we must even be humble enough to admit that we can adopt their methods particularly in social and charity work and help the poor and the weak and helpless in every corner of the world. B V Having examined some of the challenges facing Buddhists today and how we can help to promote peace and social harmony let us examine how we can identify some Buddhist values which we will need to achieve our goals. It cannot be said that there are “Buddhist Values” which are unique to Buddhism and not to be found in other religious systems. e Buddha recognized this when he de -"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"    clared that we must accept and recognize the worth of any religion in so far as that religion contains the Four Noble Truths. What is unique about Buddhism is our U -  of the nature of these values and why we practice them. When the Bodhisatta practised the Ten Paramis, he was motivated in an entirely different way than any other follower of a spiritual path either in part or as a whole. e ten paramis — dana (generosity), sila (precept), nekkhamma (renunciation), panna (wisdom), viriya (energy), khanti (patience) sacca (truthfulness), adhitthana (determi - nation), metta (loving kindness) and upekkha (equanimity) — can form a solid value system on which a Buddhist builds his or her personal spiritual life. is individual effort is then extended to members of the family, the community, the nation and finally the world as a whole. All Buddhists all over the world must consciously make the effort to un - derstand the importance of practising these values, endeav - our to practice them earnestly, and then explain them to others. Our education system and our media network must spread these values through every means possible so that our daily thinking is affected by them. We all know the famous Jataka tale in which the Bodhisatta advises his ac - robat master. To ensure perfect safety each performer must be fully concerned about his own welfare and security first."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"  In that way both parties will be safe. erefore the imple - menting of a Buddhist value-system involves making each individual understand his responsibility towards the rest, to understand the interrelatedness of all beings, to guard him or herself and thereby guard others. e year  holds many promises and challenges for all members of the human race. Buddhists are in a par - ticularly strong position to help all human beings realize their full potential and live in peace and harmony not only with themselves but with others as well. It is our duty to help spread the Buddha’s message by spreading it through the written and spoken word, but, far more importantly through the example of living noble lives in accordance with the sacred Teachings. May you all be well and happy."}]
