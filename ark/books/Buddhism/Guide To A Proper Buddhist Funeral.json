Many suggestions were made, but top of the list was the need for a Proper Buddhist Funeral Service. The Buddhist community in Malaysia is com- prised mainly of ethnic Chinese. Though Buddhism is not alien to the Chinese, the practice as it is practised in Malaysia is somewhat of a mixture of Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism. Through the practise of this tri-ism, it is not surprising to fi nd that for one who is born a ëBuddhistí and brought up a ëBuddhistí to fi nally meet his end as a Taoist. But why is this so? Firstly, since Buddhism is a way of life, its concern is more with moral conduct and the quest for enlighten- ment. The only mention of regulated rite and ritual is in the Vinaya and that, too, is solely for the discipline of its monks. Secondly, Buddhism teaches that upon death what is le ft is only ma tt er and how the remains are treated is normally of no direct consequence to the well being of the departed. This, however, does not mean that we can act dis- respectfully towards the bodily remains of those who had showered their love on us. As an act of gratitude"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"iv we should perform meaningful rites such as carrying out meritorious deeds in their memory. Though the Buddha did not lay down rules on proper rites of passage for the laity, neither did he speci fi cally prohibit his lay disciples, who are still very much a tt ached to worldly possessions, from outwardly expressing their respect and gratitude, especially in times of death and separation. ëHinder not yourselves, Ananda, by honouring the remains of the Tathagata. Ö There are wise men, among the nobles, the brahmins, the heads of houses, who are fi rm believers in the Tathagata; and they will do due honour to the remains of the Tathagata.í D.ii,  Lastly, it is di ffi cult to fi nd organisations providing such service. With the exception of some Mahayanist temples who are sincere enough to guide their devo- tees on Proper Buddhist Funerals, many are le ft to the mercy of unscrupulous undertakers and ëexpertsí who are, more o ft en than not, happy to introduce a bucket full of superstitions in the name of Buddhism. The Theravadins, too, are not spared from this predicament. In fact they are worse o ff and many who seek services from Sri Lankan, Thai or Burmese Buddhist temples are o ft en frowned upon by family elders as practising something ëun-Chineseí.

The best way to help someone who is dying is to help them to have a positive, peaceful mind. That means being free of disturbing emotions such as fear, anger, a tt achment, depression, etc. To be able to help someone else achieve such a state of mind, we need to work on our own state of mind, i.e. work on reducing our own fear, etc. If we have disturbing emotions regarding death it will be very di ffi cult to help another person to overcome theirs. In the case of a loved one, itís best to learn to let them go. Clinging to them will cause both our minds and the mind of the dying to be disturbed. It is best to be calm and peaceful; willing to listen to whatever they wish to say; be kind and sensitive and supportive, but try to avoid strong emotional reactions. The dying person, too, should be made to accept death as a natural and inevitable phenomenon, re fl ect- ing that all of us come according to our kamma (deeds) and we have to go according to our kamma.

N  Most people are afraid of death because they feel uncertain of the future. If one is not an ariyan (saint,) there is still the chance of rebirth in hell. Though we do not wish to be reborn in a woeful plane, there may be deeds performed in the past which can still cause rebirth in hell. It is useless to think of hell with aversion and fear, but the thought of hell is helpful when it reminds us to cultivate kusala (wholesomeness) at this moment instead of akusala (unwholesomeness). In the Samyu tt a Nikaya (Maha-vagga, Kindred Saying on Stream Winning, Chapter VI, par.  , Visiting the sick) we fi nd the Buddha advising Mahanama about how a wise lay -follower, who is sick, may be admonished by another wise lay-follower. ëA d i s c r e e t ( sotapanno ó one who has a tt ain the fi rst stage of sainthood) lay disciple, Mahanama, who is sickÖ should be admonished by another discreet lay-disciple with the four comfort- able assurances, thus: ìTake comfort, dear sir, in your unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, saying: He is the Exalted One, Arahant, fully enlightened One.

They are known as the Death Signs. It is during these hours of confusion, especially if the signs are not favourable, that we can play an important role in re-establishing the dying personís con fi dence (saddha) in the Triple Gem. Verse two of the Dhammapada relates a very interesting story of a boy called Ma tt akundali, who on the verge of death had the rare opportunity of seeing the Buddha in person.

If the person is still conscious, the three refuges and fi ve precepts should be adminis- tered to him. If the situation permits and the dying personís clothing is soiled, he should be cleansed and his clothes changed . This is to make him feel fresh and comfortable prior to his passing away. Though it is understandable that there will be some grieving and sorrow it is important that we remain calm in the face of grief. We should restrain ourselves from weeping and wailing before the dying person. This will only upset the sick person making it more di ffi cult for him to depart. You should not suppress your grief by force, ignore or deny its existence, but on the contrary you are encouraged to acknowledge it and through mindful- ness and wise re fl ection , gain self-composure.

Without further ado he went straight to the corpse on a charnel ground, pulled out the piece of cloth wrapping it, then washed, dyed and cut it to form a robe for himself. In the Sri Lankan traditions this rite is known as ìo ff ering"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" of cloth on behalf of the deceasedî ( mataka-vastra puj ā ). The o ff er- ing of robes or white cloth is o ff ered directly to the monks by one of the family members prior to the cremation or the burial of the body. There is no hard and fast rule for many of these procedures. One can adjust and modify accordingly. A ft er the o ff erings have been made to the monks, the monks give thanks ( anumodan ā ). Right at the start of the thanksgiving, the lay leader or host will perform the dakkhinodaka , or pouring the water of dedication, which is actually an ancient Indian gesture of giving (V  :   ). The lay leader pours the dedication water over the index fi nger (of either hand), whilst dedicating a share of the merit or punna to his or her departed ones. Verses such as Idam no natinam hotu, sukhita hontu natayo are normally recited on such occasions. Traditionally, the act of pouring the dedication water on the ground is a re-enactment of the ascetic Siddharthaís calling the earth to ìwitnessî his store of merit when, on the day before the Enlightenment, Mara the Evil One, in an a tt empt to distract the Bodhisa tt a from his spiritual path, charged that the Bodhisa tt a had done no good deeds in the past to merit him the seat under the Bodhi tree. The Bodhisa tt a simply touched the ground `calling the earth to witnessí. The whole earth, it is said, then shook and thundered in witness of the Bodhisa tt aís goodness, and Mara was routed (J  :  ). The earth represents the devoteeís store of merit: like the earth, oneís merit is always there to witness that one has done works of merit, even when there are no other living witnesses. The tree represents the Bodhi tree under which the Buddha sat. It is as if one is calling the Buddha to witness oneís meritorious deed too. In other words, the pouring of the dedication water under a tree represents the Bodhisa tt aís struggle against evil and the Buddhaís triumph over it."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" S  S  T  B  / C  C  If monks are present, they will again chant su tt as be fi t- ting the occasion, a ft er which pamsukula robes are o ff ered, and the merits transferred.

The Buddha con fi rmed that the dedication of merits result- ing from a wholesome deed to the departed next-of-kin, who might have been reborn in an unfortunate state, is the true and e ff ectual way of helping them overcome their defects and later gain a good rebirth. Performance of alms-giving to the unsurpassable fi eld of merit; i.e. the Maha Sangha , is the best way for the cultivation of merits necessary to bring the most e ff ective results to the departed next-of-kin petas . The e ffi cacy of this practice was proven many a time during the Buddhaís life as documented in the Petava tt hu . The pamsukula rite, or the last rite for the Buddhist, is actu- ally a re-enactment of an incident that took place during the life of the Buddha. At a time when the Blessed One was proceeding to Rajagaha, King Bimbisara (who had tried to o ff er his kingdom to the Bodhisa tt a earlier) went to visit him with thousands of brahmins. A ft er hearing the Dhamma, King Bimbisara was on that very day established in the fruit of Sotapa tt i. He then invited the Buddha to a meal in the palace on the following day. During the alms-giving the departed next-of-kin petas of King Bimbisara stood outside the walls of the palace thinking. ìThe king will dedicate the merits of the alms giving to us.î However, a ft er the alms-giving King Bimbisara neglected to dedicate the merits of the merit-making to his departed next-of- kin petas , as he was pre-occupied about choosing a suitable site to built a vihara for the Buddha.

The king heard this ëunearthlyí noise and became very frightened. At daybreak the king told the Buddha about his dread- ful experience and asked what would become of him. The Buddha explained to the king: ìFormer relatives of yours who have been reborn as petas have been going round for an immeasurable long time since the last Buddha kappa (Buddha Phussaís time, about  kappas ago) expecting to be released from their su ff ering. They had expected you to dedicate to them the alms-giving done yesterday, but you did not. They were extremely distressed by this and lamented their lost hope.î The king said, ëO Blessed One, would they received the merits if I give alms today and dedicated the merits to them?î The Buddha replied in the a ffi rmative and King Bimbisara then took the initiative to perform the rites for the deceased called Dakkhinaupadana in Buddhism. He invited the Buddha and a number of Bhikkhus to have a meal within his royal palace. During the alms-giving to the Buddha and the Order of Ariya Sangha , strange things happened. The Buddha, using his supernor- mal powers, caused the petas from outside the walls of the palace to be clearly seen by the king. As the king gave the gi ft of water saying, ìLet this be for my relatives!î at that moment, lotus ponds appeared around the petas . The petas bathed in them and their weariness and thirst was allayed; their bodies became the colour of gold. The king gave rice gruel and both hard and so ft food and dedicated these actions. All at once, the petas had food to eat and their faculties were refreshed. The king gave robes and lodging and dedicated these actions. Instantly, the petas were richly adorned and they had well- furnished palaces to live in.

Peta = pa + ita; lit, departed beings, or (those) absolutely devoid of happiness. They are not disembodied spirits or ghosts Although they possess material forms, generally they are invisible to the physical eye. They have no plane of their own but live in forests, dirty surroundings, etc. Greed, hatred and delusion ( lobha , dosa , moha ) provide the basis of actions. As a result of actions born of these, one is not reborn among either men, gods, or in any other state of bliss, but in sorrowful states of existence like Pe tt ivisaya , etc. (A.  .  ) Petas live a life of misery generally, subject to incessant pain and suf- fering. The o ff ering of Pamsukula (i.e. o ff ering of cloth) when a person dies, is to enable the dead person (in case he or she has been reborn as a naked Peta ), to obtain garments to cover his or her nakedness. And, among these, only those Petas born in the Parada tt upa-Jivi Peta world are able to receive and share in the Merits of the good deeds of their relatives and loved ones.

Firstly, those who have done heavy unwhole- some or evil acts ( Akusala Kammapatha ) and have taken birth as hellish beings or animals. Secondly, those who have abstained from such evil acts and have been born to the world of celestial or human beings once again. These kinds of beings live on the ëfoodí of their own planes and as such are not in the position to appreci- ate and enjoy the meritorious fruits so dedicated. Again, the Brahmin asked if, in cases where the relative did not take birth in the planes of hungry ghosts ( peta ) ,who then would be able to receive the dedication of merit. The Buddhaís reply was that in such a case, other departed relatives would appreciate them. This is because it is impossible that there should not be in that plane any relative whatever (when traced back to the remote past) of the donors. The Brahmin further asked, ìIf those beings have taken birth in the realms where appreciation is impossible, is there any other condition to be of some help to them in those realms?î The Buddha replied to the e ff ect that they would bene fi t by whatever charity they themselves used to do while on the human plane (i.e. they can only bene fi t from their past store of good kamma ). For instance, if they are born as animals such as elephants and horses, they will be fed fairly well with su ffi cient supply of food and water. If, on the other hand they are born human or celestial beings, they will be provided adequately with whatever they need to live on comfortably. On the side of the givers or donors, therefore, there can be no loss whatever. ëA gi ft so given, will not be fruitless, for the givers themselves experience the fruit of such deeds.í Here, it would be interesting to note that not all petas are able to receive the dedication of merit. In an answer given by Ven. Nagasena to King Milinda it is mentioned that three out of the"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" four classes of Petas are unable to receive the merit dedicated to them. These are: (  ) the Petas who feed on what has been vomited up ( Vantasik a ) (  ) the Petas who su ff er from extreme hunger and thirst ( Khuppipasino ), and (  ) the Petas who always su ff er from burning fi re, heat, etc. ( N ij jhamatanahika ). Only those who depend on what others give ( Parada tt atupa-jivika ), and who remember their living relatives and see what they do, can receive and share in the merits of such o ff erings. The last type of peta is normally reborn in the surroundings of the house, etc. An example would be people who would normally worry; a ft er death they would be reborn as petas staying around the house. They would appear to relatives or others as ghosts: To recapitulate, there are in Buddhism three conditions whereby the rites for the deceased can yield the expected results. They are:  . The donors or givers are required to make a mental note dedicating the meritorious fruits thereof. There is no problem regarding whether or not the pouring of water is used as a supplementary factor. What counts is the intention or resolution made on the occasion.  . The deceased who have taken birth in the planes of hungry ghosts, having known and appreciated the shar- ing or dedication of the fruits of merits.  . The act of charity is a worthy one, being dispensed towards the persons worthy of the gi ft s. In Buddhism this refers fi rstly to the Bhikkhus , because they are leading a holy life by serving others to bring them into the correct path, secondly to other persons who are in need of such an act.
