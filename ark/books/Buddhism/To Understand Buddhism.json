Howev er, not many p eople t ruly understand what Buddhism is. Therefore, this becomes a very important topic. What exactly is Buddhism? We need to und erstand it clearly. Buddhism is a most virtu ous an d perfect education directed b y the Bud dha towards all sentient beings in the nine realms . How c an we tell that Buddhism is an education? First, we can tell from th e way we call Buddha Shakyamuni ou r “Original Tea cher” that he is the fo unde r of Bu ddhism an d that we ar e his students. From this, it is very apparent that the Buddha and we share a teacher-stud ent relationship . This is onl y found in education. If Buddhism is his teaching, who then is the Buddha? Buddha is a Sanskrit wo rd meani ng wisdom and enlightenment . However , this wisdom is not the worldly wisdom we th ink of tod ay. Broad ly speaki ng,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 the Buddha’s wisdom is the ability to ultimately, perfectly and correctly compreh end th e true reality of life and th e universe in the past, present an d futur e. One who has perceived this wisdom is called a Buddha. Bu ddha Sha kyam uni told us that all sentient beings, includ ing ourselves, possess this innate wisdom and ability. Thus Buddhism regards all beings equally. Although we are equal in origin , presently we cannot see this because ev eryone’s wisdom and abilities differ. In our society, th ere are those who ar e intelligent and those who ar e not, those with great ability and those with less. How do these things com e about? The Buddha told us that they are due to ou r varying degrees of delusion . Our innate wisdom and abilities are tempor arily lost due to this delusion , but are not truly o r perm anently lost. If we ca n break thr ough this delusion, then we will be able to recov er these abilities. Therefore, the Buddha’s teachings show us how to ri d ourselves of delusi on an d to uncov er o ur innate abilities. It is often stated in Mah ayana sutras that the Buddha did not directly he lp sentient bei ngs. The n how do sentient beings becom e Buddhas? By themselves. The Buddha only assists from the side b y explaini ng the true reality of how w e delude ourselves. After realizing this, we diligently put his teachings into practice to attain enlightenment of tru e reality. We"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 then become Buddhas. Buddha Sh akya muni clearly explained tha t becoming a Buddha is attainable by all sentient beings. From this, we can see that Buddhism is a teaching. However, a teach er ca n only educate us about the principles, tell us o f his/her exp eriences in practice and attainment, and s uggest vari ous meth ods fo r our attainment. The rest ultimately depends upon us. We are the ones who ne ed to b e enthusiastic and diligent in ord er to attain achi evement. Once we u nderstand that Buddhism is an education, we will logically regard the Buddha as ou r teacher. F rom this, we understand that in prop er Way Places , we do not regard the Bud dha or Bodhisattva images as gods t o be worshipped . We make o fferings to these images for two reasons. First, to rememb er a nd rep ay our gratitude for this trul y great education , which we h ave so fortunately encountered and accepted in this lifetime. The op ening verse to sutras says it very well; “It is extremely di fficult to en count er this teaching in infinite eons.” The debt of gratitude we owe the Buddha is similar to the reme mbr ance, which some Chinese have toward their ancestors. We reflect on our origins f or without these ancestors we woul d not exist. The secon d reason we m ake o fferings t o the Bud dha is to follow the examples o f the vir tuous. Bu ddha Shakyam uni was an o rdinar y perso n like us; yet, he"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 was able to be awaken ed and become a Buddha. What is there to stop us from achi eving this as well? Therefore, th e pictures or statues o f the Buddha serve to remind us every mom ent to advanc e diligently towards this goal. Th e images ar e not to be reg arded as gods o r objects of s uperstition. In Buddhist Way Places, the images of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have many appe arances. This has often led to the misconception that not only is Buddhism a religion but on e that worships multi-deities as well. Indeed B uddhas a nd Bodhisattvas hav e man y names. For example, in the Tripitaka ther e is the Ten Thousan d-Bu ddh a Names Sutra, whic h gives us ov er twelve thousand Bu ddha’s na mes and even more names for Bodhisattvas. Why are there so many Buddhas and B odhisattvas? Within our or iginal-nat ure there exists infinite wisdom, vir tuous a nd artistic abilities that cannot be completely r epresented by merely on e name . It is similar to a high ly accomplished p erson in a prominen t position; his or her business card could have numerous titles. The names o f the Buddhas represent the co mplete, innate and virtuous abilities within our self-na ture . All the Bodhisattva names represent cultivatio n of different virtues . Th e original abilities within our self- nature are infinite, but temporarily lost. Without genuine cultivation, we will no t be able to un cover any of them. All th e Buddha and Bodhisattva names are"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 non e other th an ourselves. Once we understand this, we will realize that a high leve l of artistry r epresents the styles of the Buddha’s teachings. For example, sculptures an d pictures can express the Dharm a. Understanding the tru e meaning of these images will help on e to gain the tru e benefits of the Buddha’s teachings. If Buddhism is not a religio n, wh y is it not then a philosop hy? I n philos ophy , there is bo th a subject a nd an object. In Mah ayana Buddhism, there is no differenc e between subject and object; they ar e one. This meaning is ve ry prof oun d an d difficult to understand. For example, a great master said, “Utilizing gold to form utensils, all utensils are of gold.” Are the gold and the ut ensil the same thin g or different? F rom their appear ances they look like two different th ings. Howev er, f rom thei r com position we realize that they are the same. One needs a profound intuitive compr ehension to truly understand the realit y of life and th e universe. All of the Mahayana Sutras try to explain this concept and truth. One will share th e same viewpoints with the Buddha whe n on e trul y und erstands and clear ly recognizes this truth . Ordina ry p eople, like we are deluded . In what way? Because we see everyth ing in opposition to the o ther, not knowing that in reality everythi ng is actually on e an d not two."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 Chapter Two: The Goal of the Buddha ’ s Teaching From the intrinsic na ture of Buddhism, we proce ed to the goal of the Buddha’s teachings. This goal is to break t hrough de lusion a nd achieve enlighte nment. The Buddh a point ed out to us wh y we are leadi ng lives of suffer ing and why the six realms of reinc arnation exist. It is so, because the wisdom and vir tuous abilities in our or iginal nature hav e yet to be uncov ered. Thus, all our view points and ways of interacting with life and the universe are inco rrect. The erron eous acts committed due to these in correct viewpoints and w ays have resulte d in the su fferin g of reincarnation within the six realms. The goa l of the Buddha’s teach ings is to help and guide us to brea k thr oug h ou r delusion , to be awakened and escape this suff ering and t o obtain happiness. What do we seek in Buddhism? We seek Annuttara-Samy ak-Samb odhi, th e Perfect Complete Enlightenmen t. The Buddha teaches and hopes that all of us will attain this ultimate enlightenm ent, in other words, will become a Buddha."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 The Perfect Complete Enli ghtenment c an b e explain ed as three levels: Arhats , Bodhisattvas and Buddhas. The first is “Proper Enlightenment.” In our world, th ere are some very intelligent and wise people, such as scientists, philosophers a nd religi ous leaders. Th ey have reach ed h ighe r realization tha n most people have. However, although they m ay h ave reach ed a certain level of realization , the Bud dha wou ld not reco gnize their knowledge as the prop er enlight enment , because they hav e not sever ed their afflictions . Th ey still dwell on the r ights and wro ngs of ot hers, o n gre ed, a nger, ignoranc e an d arrogance. They still harbor wandering, discriminatory t hou ghts and attachm ents . I n other words, their m inds are not p ure. Without th e pure mind , no matte r how hi gh the level of realizati on one reaches, it is still not the proper enlightenment. In Bud dhism, the standa rd f or p roper enlighte nment is the pur e min d fro m which wisdom arises. It is the wish of all Buddhas that we attain this prop er enlightenment . This is the level o r degre e of an Arhat and is similar to attending a un iversity to earn an unde rgraduate degree. Th erefor e, Arhat, Bodhisattva and Buddha are titles similar to degrees of enlightenment attain ed in Bud dhism. T hose who achieve p roper enlightenm ent are called Arhats. Arhats do not have illusory or misleading thoughts and viewpoints. The y do not dwell on th e rights and wrongs o f others , or on th oughts of gre ed, a nger, ignoranc e or arrogance."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 From this, we can comprehend intuitively the difference between Buddhism and worldly education. From the Buddha, we learn the true teachings and proper enlightenment. Only with this proper enlightenment can one escape all sufferings to obtain true happiness. As human beings, we undergo the sufferings of birth, old age, sickness and death. We do not attain what we seek, are parted with our loved ones and find ourselves in the presence of those whom we resent or even hate. We are surrounded by all these sufferings with no apparent way of being truly free. Only after learning Buddhism will we be able to reach genuine liberation. The Flower Adornment Sutra explains to us, “All sentient beings possess the same wisdom and virtuous capabilities as the Buddha, but these qualities are unattainable due to wandering thoughts and attachments.” This clearly explains the root cause of our problems. Practicing Buddhism is to accord with the teachings of the Buddha, to rid us of wandering, discriminating thoughts and attachments. Thus, we uncover our pure mind, in turn giving rise to true wisdom, which is proper enlightenment. Therefore, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas would not recognize the intelligent and worldly wisdom, as it lacks the pure mind, the proper enlightenment. Upon attaining proper enlightenment, one has the ability to transcend the endless cycles of birth and death, not to mention the ability to solve everyday problems."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 Whether talking about the Buddha’s education or worldly education, it is essential to understand the concept of delving deeply into one method in order to attain achievement. This is especially so in Buddhism. One who truly wishes to learn effectively needs to follow only one teacher and practice only one path to ensure a smooth journey. When following two teachers with two different paths, one is bound to become confused as to which path to take. Even worse, following three teachers catches one at a T street. With four teachers one is caught at a cross street. Today’s young people like to learn a lot, but fail to attain a good result. The problem lies with being caught at those cross streets, confused as to which way to take. For one to succeed and attain achievement in practicing Buddhism, one needs to follow just one teacher and concentrate on just one method. What is this achievement? True achievement is attaining a pure mind. Upon achieving some degree of pure mind, one will have fewer afflictions and thus an increase in true wisdom, enabling one to solve problems in this world and beyond. Without this true wisdom, there is no way to truly solve problems. Therefore, true wisdom is essential in leading a happy and fulfilling life. On a broader scale, it can help us to solve society’s problems. Today there are many intelligent politicians who thought they were very smart but have ended up"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 bringing their countries to the brink of disaster, as well as putting their citizens through much misery. What is the reason for this? These leaders have not severed their afflictions, discriminating and wandering thoughts, and attachments. Consequently, their first consideration is their own benefit, their self- attachment. The Buddha taught us to attain true wisdom by first breaking free of our own viewpoints. Without this wisdom, one could misinterpret the meanings within the Mahayana sutras. If one is able to part from the selfish mind, then true benefits will definitely be received. With proper enlightenment, only when one has no ego or self-attachment, will one be able to differentiate true from false, proper from deviated, right from wrong and beneficial from harmful. Without breaking through one’s own viewpoints, one will not have these abilities. From this, we understand there is a standard to the proper enlightenment. One level above the proper enlightenment is the “ Equal and Proper Enlightenment .” Equal means equal to the Buddha, but not yet having become a Buddha. This level is higher than that of an Arhat. The equal and proper enlightenment requires one to break through one degree of ignorance, to attain one degree of Dharma body. At this point, the way one views the reality of life and the universe is very close to that of"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13 the Buddhas. One who achi eves the equal and proper enlightenment woul d be called a Bo dhisattva. The Flower Adornment Sutra explains th e fort y-one levels of Bodhisattvas, all of which have these levels of enlight enment. Aft er bre aking thro ugh th e ve ry last degree of ignoranc e, pe rfecting wisdom and enlightenment , one a chieves the “ Perfect, Complete Enlightenmen t ” that is Buddhahood . There fore, Buddha, Bodhisattva and Arha t are co mmon titles, not a specific name for a specific person. They are titles similar to those of Doctorate, Master or Graduate degrees. For example, in the n ame Guan Yin Bodhisattva, Guan Yin r epresents great compassion and kindness. The title of Bodhisattva is similar to a Masters Degree. Presently, peopl e have misconceptions ab out Bud dhas and Bo dhisattvas, thinking these names are specific be ings. Th ey do not understand that these titles refer to any being who possesses those characteristics. Buddha or Bodhisattva, when added to a name is simply referring to a specialty. From the intrinsic na ture of Buddhism, we realize that our purpose o f practice is to seek wisdom. In Zen, this goal is called, “In pursuit of clarity of mind to see into one’s self-natur e.” I n other words “Complete Enlightenmen t.” In the Pure L and Sc hool, this is called “One Mind U ndisturbed.” The Pur e Land Sc hool is unique in that not onl y does o ne seek to have One"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 Mind Undisturb ed but also seeks birth into the Western Pure Land . This is unlike othe r schools, which rely on one’s own strength of cultivation in seeking solely on e goal. The Pur e Lan d meth od has two goals that can be achiev ed in one lifetime. One who is very familiar with th e Infinite Life Sutra and understood its teachings would be free o f doubt. The full title of this sutra reveals the goals of our practice: The Bu ddh a Speaks o f the Infinite Life Sutra of Adornment , Purity , Equality an d Enlightenm ent of the Mahay ana Sch ool . Infinite life and adornment are what Pure Land practitioners seek. Infinite life refers to the merits and v irtues o f one’s p erfect self-nature. Adornment ref ers to perfect complete wisdom with great ease and fulfillment. Purity, equality and enlightenment ar e the methods, the three ways of practice. Upon attaining any one, all thre e are attained. Of all the schools of B uddhism , none s urpass these three ways o f practice. The Zen School uses the awak enin g path to reach the great enlightenment and attain the clarity to see into one’s tru e nature. B uddhist schools oth er tha n Zen stress the practice of understanding o r proper viewpoints, until rea ching great complete understand ing. The Pure L and Sc hool, on th e other hand, concent rates on th e pur e mind. A perso n with purity of mind will naturally be non-discriminating and awaken ed. An aw akened person will naturally"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15 have a pure and non-discriminating mind. The route chosen may be different but all reach the same goal. In Zen practice it is expressed as “obtaining clarity of mind and seeing into one’s true nature.” Different schools may use different names but the results or the level of the state of mind are the same. Therefore, to criticize any other schools would be to slander both the Buddha and the Dharma. All these methods were passed down to us from Buddha Shakyamuni. Choosing any path will enable one to attain achievement. How can we say that one method is better than another? From all these different methods we just need to know how to choose the one method that is most suitable for us and our level. First, if the level of the method we chose were beyond us, making it difficult to practice, we would not succeed easily with that method. Second, it needs to be suitable and convenient for our manner of living. Third, it needs to be compatible with modern society, because we cannot separate ourselves from society or other human beings. Therefore, we need to consider these factors to choose our method of cultivation. However, no matter which method one practices, it is essential to be rid of self-viewpoint and attachment in order to obtain the benefits from practice. Or else, like so many have experienced, the great efforts put into the practice will have been in vain. Some practitioners"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 have felt that even afte r years of practice th ey h ave achieved vir tually nothing, even to the point of feeling that they were better off before th ey practiced. It seemed as if the mor e the y practiced, th e worse they felt. All this comes from having chosen a method that was unsuitable for th em. This is similar to choosing an unsuitable major in school . When on e ch ooses a major that is not suited to one’s foundation and ability, one has an extremely difficult time t rying to succeed. Choosing the r ight majo r makes study ing much easier, so one will have a much better ch ance of success. The same thing g oes fo r practicing Bu ddhism. I f on e does not k now on e’s own capacit y, one can test oneself. Like myself, for ex ample. Afte r reading many Mahayana sutras, I thought myself incapable of any achievement.

These are my experiences from decades of practice."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18 Chapter Three: Symbolism and the Arts After we understand clearly the goal of the Buddha’s teachings, we will view the sutras differently. These sutras are one of the world’s largest literary collections. I believe that when considering the range of all academia, none of them surpass Buddhism. To obtain the benefits from this vast collection, it is necessary for us to know and understand the essence of it’s content, which is the true reality of all Dharma, the true reality of life and the universe. Life refers to ourselves. Universe refers to the living environment that surrounds us. It would be incorrect to treat Buddhism as an abstract and obscure learning that had nothing to do with our daily lives. Every word in the sutra closely relates to our daily living. Furthermore, it is definitely not superstition. How and where do we start? For convenience, the perfection in the methods of the Buddha’s teaching, uses a high level of creativity. Buddhism of two thousand years ago had already taken an artistic path. For example, all the Buddha’s names and sculptures represent our virtuous nature, innate qualities of wisdom, virtuous abilities and artistic talents. All of the Bodhisattva’s names and forms represent our cultivation of virtue. They instruct us how to apply the teachings in our daily lives to bring out our virtuous nature so that we may receive Buddhism’s benefits."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19 In Chinese Mahayana Buddhism, four great Bodhisattvas represent our order of practice and level of achievement. The first is Earth Store Bodhisattva. Whether we are thinking of worldly teachings, the dharma or Buddhism; nothing can be accomplished without the earth or a place of existence. The existence of humans cannot be separated from our great earth as we rely upon it for survival. Whether clothing, food, living or working, all rely on the production of the land, thus the infinite treasures that the great earth encompasses are seemingly endless for us to use. The word “earth” in the name Earth Store Bodhisattva represents the mind and the word “store” means treasure. The Buddha’s teachings guide us to first start the practice from our mind, as our true nature encompasses the infinite wisdom and virtuous abilities that are no different from those of Buddhas or Bodhisattvas. However, today it seems as if we have lost our innate wisdom and virtuous abilities. The Buddha told us that all these qualities are not truly lost, just not yet uncovered. In the present moment, we endlessly immerse ourselves in wandering, discriminating thoughts and attachments, which have resulted in this temporary loss of abilities. However, inside the true mind, no wandering thoughts exist. If a mind has wandering thoughts then that mind is a false one. We originally possessed this true mind, so practicing Buddhism is simply recovering it."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 Therefore, our first goal in practice is to uncover and look for the treasure in our mind. In other words, the Buddha’s teachings do not seek from the outside but rather they seek from within our self-nature. Earth Store Bodhisattva represents filial piety; thus, the Earth Store Sutra is about filial piety, a basic concept that everyone would do well to start from. The kindness that our parents have shown by giving us life and nurturing us is beyond description. To be filial and take care of our parents is naturally our basic responsibility. Not only do we need to take care of their material needs but of their spiritual life as well. Moreover, we need to nurture their aspirations for us and for us, this is the hardest of all. Parents wish their children to have successful careers, behave well, and to be respected by current and future generations. In other words, we would do well to act in a manner, which will make them proud of us. Therefore, the ultimate and perfect achievement of filial piety is to become Buddha. We begin our practice from here and expand our filial piety and respect to include all sentient beings. The second Bodhisattva, Guan Yin, represents the cultivation of great compassion and kindness. What is the meaning of making offerings to Guan Yin Bodhisattva? It is to remind us that we would do well to treat all people with great compassion and kindness,"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21 to use unconditional love and care to help all sentient beings. The third Bodhisattva, Manjusri, r epresents wisdom and rationale , remindin g us that when we practice and interact with others we ne ed to fulfill our filial duty, to rely u pon wisdom and rationale, not o n emoti on. The fourth Bodhisattva, the Great Samant abhadra (Universal Worthy ) represents car ryin g out the cultivation truthfully, applying filial piety, compassion, ki ndness an d rationale in ou r daily lives. When one p erfectly achi eves the way of Univ ersal Worthy Bodhisattva, one beco mes a Buddha. Buddhism teaches us how to live i n harmony with the true reality of life and the universe. In oth er words, we would live p erfect and wonderful lives similar to those of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. This is the true, ultimate and pe rfect Mahay ana teaching. To practice Buddhism, we start by: 1) Being filial and respectful toward parents, teachers and elders, 2) Having th e great co mpassionate mind, 3) Nurturin g one’s th inkin g and wisd om and 4) Broadenin g one’s mi nd."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22 Although in sequenc e, they also c an b e practiced simultaneously, as each en compasses the others. For example, be ing filial to parents includes compassion and ki ndness, reasoni ng an d wisdom. Wisdom includes being filial, compassionate and kind. Once we have a general und erstandin g of Bu ddhism, how d o we appl y it to o ur daily liv ing? First we need to know what each Buddha and Bodhisattva represents. If we do not, the n Buddhism w ould be reduced to superstition and we would not receive its true ben efits. All Buddhist sutras contain these qualities, characteristics and the ways of practice; therefore, learning on ly on e sutra will be enough. One needs to k now how to understand and apply the teachings effectively. Usually in the cente r of th e main hall of a wa y place, there are statues o f one Buddha and two Bodhisattvas, which represen t our self-nature and original entity. The two Bodhisattvas represen t ou r virtuous abilities within our self -nature; one is u nderstandin g and the other is practice. If the Buddha in the middle is Buddha Shakyamuni, then the two figures on either side of him will be M anjusri and Universal Worthy Bodhisattvas, representing wisdom and application respectively. Thus, und erstanding an d practice are combined into one. If the hall has the three sages of the Western Pure Land, with Buddha Amitabha in the middle, representing self-na ture, th en the two figures"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23 on either side of him will be Guan Yin and Great Strength Bodhisattvas. They respectively r epresent compassion and wisdom, completely symbolizing the infinite wisdom and virtuous capabilities. Therefore, we again see that Buddhism is a teaching. There ar e pro found teachings within the n ames of the Buddhas and B odhisattvas, for example th e nam e of Buddha Sha kyam uni tells us the principles o f the Buddha’s edu cation. “Sh akya” me ans hum anity and kindness. “Muni ” means purity o f mind . The teach ing of these two qualities is advocated because p eople in our w orld lack compassion an d ki ndness, and are oft en selfish. Moreover , all sentient beings lac k purit y of mind, c onstantly dwelling i n wander ing t hou ghts, greed, anger , ign orance and ar rog ance. Any Bodhisattva who bec omes a Buddh a in this world will be named Shakya muni to teach us th e remedy fo r our problems. Onc e the r epresentations of B uddha and Bodhisattva statues are understood intuitively just by looking at them , one will perf ectly co mpreh end the goal of the Buddha’s teachings. When we enter the f irst hall of a way place, th e Hall of Heavenly Guardians, we will see the statue of Maitreya Bodhisattva surr ound ed b y the four Heavenly Guardians in the middle of the hall. Maitreya Bodhisattva, known in the west as the Happy Buddha, has a hug e smile representin g joy fulness.

Next to him are four Heavenly Guardians or Dharma Protectors who teach us how to protect ourselves. The Eastern Dharma Protector, symbolizes fulfilling one’s duty and responsibility, teaching us that regardless of position, one needs to fulfill one’s duties. He is holding a lute in his hand. The strings of the instrument should not be too tight, or else they will break; nor should they be too loose or they will not play well. When properly adjusted and balanced, the instrument will play beautifully, clearly symbolizing that we need to take the middle path when interacting with matters, people and objects. When each of us fulfills our responsibilities and obligations, how could the nation not prosper? The Southern Dharma Protector symbolizes improvement and daily advancement. Not only do matters need to be taken care of appropriately; continuous improvement also needs to be sought. In his right hand, the Southern Dharma Protector holds the sword of wisdom and in his left hand a ring symbolizing the perfection of wisdom, showing us that one needs to use wisdom in seeking improvement. The sword symbolizes how one needs to sever afflictions before they are out of control."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25 The third and fourth Heavenly Guardians are the Western and the Northern Dharma Protectors, representing comprehensive vision and listening respectively. Both teach us to observe and listen more carefully as well as to read numerous books and travel to many places for comprehensive learning. They teach us to do well in our job, to adopt the good qualities as well as to disregard the shortcomings of others. The Western Dharma Protector represents far-sighted observation and holds a dragon or snake. The dragon or snake symbolizes constant change. In his other hand, he holds a bead, symbolizing principles. People, matters and objects in society undergo changes constantly. One needs to observe very carefully and thoroughly, to have a firm grasp on the principles within in order to be able to control this “dragon or snake.” The Northern Dharma Protector holds an umbrella to prevent one from being contaminated. This reminds us that within a complex society, one needs to know how to protect one’s body and mind from pollution and corruption. From these examples, we can see that the artistic aspects of the Buddha’s education are truly beautiful. Unfortunately, many people regard these Dharma protectors as gods to be worshipped, which is totally wrong."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26 Chapter Four: The Five Guidelines of Practice The Three Conditions After establishing Pure La nd Lea rning Centers in several countries, we set five guidelines for Pur e Land practitioners to follow.

Th e first guideline is the Three Conditions , extracte d fro m the Visualization Sutra , which pr ovides a v ery im portant fou ndatio n for cultivation.

The Second Condition inc ludes: a) Taking th e Three Refuges , b) Abiding by laws, customs, an d prec epts and c) Conducting oneself in prop er and dignified m anne r. The main principle of our practice is awakening, prop er th oughts a nd viewpo ints, an d purity. A beginni ng step in lea rning Bu ddhism is to Take Refuge in the Triple Jewels. After one generates the heart to Tak e Refuge in the Triple Jewels by accepting, lea rning and practicing Buddhism, one finds a Dharm a Master to pass on th e principl e, goal and directi on o f practicin g Buddhism.

If we part from this discriminating mind and attachments, can we still see objects clearly? We cannot say we do not see them, but if we see them very clearly without discriminating thoughts and attachments, then we are awakened. When there is the slightest discrimination or attachment, one is deluded. The same applies to our attaching to the form we are looking at; it is delusion. Initially, objects do not have names but are given them by people. The names, like the object, are not real. Apart from the names and appearances, what we see is the true form. We are deluded about these forms, their physical features and their names. Consequently, when we rid ourselves of these delusions, we will not be attached. This is how we can train ourselves to return and rely upon the Buddha Jewel or Enlightenment. If someone points to a table and asks what it is, we will naturally say it is a table because that is what everybody calls it. We go along with everybody’s attachment but if we are not attached to it ourselves, then we will be awakened. Therefore, the minds of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are pure and without the slightest pollution for they are completely without these attachments. When with others, we can go along with them but maintain our purity inside. In this way, we return and rely upon awakening.

The Dharma that we return to and rely upon refers to proper thoughts and viewpoints, which is hard to accomplish. Only when we are truly enlightened, will our thoughts and viewpoints be correct. Before we reach enlightenment, we can adopt the proper thoughts and viewpoints of Buddha Shakyamuni as ours. All the thoughts and viewpoints within the sutras are correct. We can at first rely on Buddha Shakyamuni, but only for a while, as he does not want us to rely upon him forever. This is like a student relying on teachers in school but becoming independent after graduation. Likewise, before we attain great enlightenment, we need to rely on Buddha Shakyamuni and Buddha Amitabha as our teachers. Where is the Buddha? The Buddha is within the sutras, as Buddha Shakyamuni stated in the Infinite Life Sutra and Buddha Amitabha relayed to us through the Forty- eight Great Vows. Relying on the teachings within the sutra is relying on the Buddha. We would do well to practice earnestly what the Buddha taught us to do or refrain from doing. In this way we will be true and good students.

Second, awakening is the aspiration to benefit and help all sentient beings, to think of others and not of oneself. What are the urgent needs of sentient beings? There is nothing more important than the Buddha’s teachings. Thus, our most pressing need is nurturing and training lecturers to continue to pass on Buddhism. Today due to our advanced printing skills, numerous sutras have been distributed throughout the world, but regretfully, few people lecture on them. Since people have the tendency to misunderstand the meanings within the sutras, we need qualified people to lecture and explain them. Today the best way to benefit others is to train lecturers and at the same time gain innumerable merits. We work toward this goal with a great tolerant mind, not just for one Way Place, area or country but for the whole world. If only one country prospers and the others are poor, the poor will envy and resent the prosperous, leading to conflicts or worse. How could one pass the days peacefully knowing this?

This is the most beneficial way for one to put the Bodhi mind into practice. To believe deeply in the Law of Cause and Effect does not simply refer to “What goes around comes around.” The profound meaning is, “Being mindful of Buddha Amitabha is the cause and becoming Buddha is the consequence.” For the Pure Land practitioner, reciting and upholding Mahayana Sutras can be accomplished by reciting the Infinite Life Sutra . Delving deeply into one method can be achieved by concentrating on one sutra. If one does not think this is sufficient, the four other sutras and one commentary of the Pure Land School could also be recited. These six are more than enough. Simply allow them to take root and flourish. Finally, one encourages others on the path to enlightenment. The first three parts of the Third Condition benefit the self.

The Buddh a set six principles f or us to follow. Not only are these applicable within a Buddhist com munity but also in all o rganizations or g roups.

Th e six rules that the Buddha set for Buddhist communities are something all its members follow, making this group the most worth y of respect and of being a role model for all.

If everyone has different viewpoints and ideas, then conflicts would be unavoidable, making the group discordant. Therefore, sharing the same goals and viewpoints is very important, making this the first of the Six Principles. The second of the Principles is to observe the same precepts and rules. There are both broad and narrow meanings within the word “Precept.” The narrow meaning includes upholding the five or ten layperson precepts, monk’s or nun’s precepts, or Bodhisattva precepts and the Buddha’s teachings. In a broader sense, “Observing precepts” includes abiding by etiquette, customs, rules and laws of the entire world. Today, through the advancement of technology in travel and communication, our sphere of activity is not limited to our country but expands to other countries as well. Whether sightseeing, on business, or visiting others, it is essential to observe the local customs and laws, to live in harmony, thus being welcomed and respected by others. This principle is practical and brings joy to others; therefore, upholding Buddhist precepts also includes following the customs and laws of the country. All governments welcome law-abiding citizens, so to truly promote and be a benefactor of Buddhism is to uphold the precepts. With this as a base, people could then harmoniously live without arguments and share the joy of practicing together."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"36 When living together and sharing a common consensus, a group would naturally not have any conflicts. To practice with the same goal and to achieve improvement daily would ensure that the community would experience joy and inner peace. The last of the Six Principles is to share benefits equally. Benefits refer to our daily necessities. A Sangha does not merely represent a community of monks and nuns. At home, the family can also practice Buddhism and accord with the Six Principles of Harmony to make up a sangha. Even within a company, everyone, from the employer to the workers, can practice Buddhism to make up a sangha. Therefore, sangha has a very broad meaning. Within a Sangha, one strives to share benefits. For left-home people it means having the same manner of living, from the abbot to one with no formal responsibilities within the community, everyone shares the same manner of living, with no special treatment. We would do well to live by the Six Principles of Harmony to learn how to better get along with others. When with other organizations or groups, regardless of whether or not they follow the Six Principles of Harmony, we ourselves need to accord with the spirit of these Principles to truly follow the Buddha’s teachings.

The Three Learnin gs The third guideline is the Three Le arnings : self- discipline, concentration and wisdom.

Why? We have discarded law and order. The precepts thoroughly explain the principles, methods and the level of mind we need to bring about law and order. The Three Learnings clearly explain this concept. We practice the Buddha’s teachings in order to attain the ultimate, perfect wisdom. Once we uncover this inner wisdom, we will know the true reality of life and the universe, including how to restore our original abilities. The Buddha told us that all sentient beings possess a Buddha’s wisdom and virtuous abilities. While the knowledge of the past, present and future is part of our original ability, they are unfortunately covered and hidden by our delusion. Delusion occurs when the mind/heart is not still, while an enlightened one remains unaffected. When our six senses encounter the environment, our mind/heart moves, giving rise to wandering thoughts. The Buddha taught numerous ways to practice so we can remain unaffected in all situations, not giving rise to any wandering, discriminating thoughts or attachments, thus recovering our original capabilities. This state of mind is deep concentration. Cultivation is correcting one’s erroneous thoughts, speech and behavior. What are the standards for these?

Discipline is the external standard and precept observation is the internal standard; concentration is the standard for the pure mind. The external standard is very important, but much more important is the internal standard, because it helps us to achieve our goal in the practice to attain wisdom. With self-discipline, we attain the concentration that gives rise to wisdom. This ultimate, perfect wisdom is “Annuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi.” How does one first attain proper realization, then equal and proper realization, and finally perfect, complete realization? These levels of attainment depend on the strength of concentration, the extent of the purity of mind. As Buddhists, the goal of our practice is Perfect, Complete Enlightenment. If one departs from rules of order and purity of mind, one is not practicing Buddhism. No matter which method one practices, whether Buddha Name Chanting, precept observing, mantra chanting, or Zen meditation; if one does not follow the guidelines, one cannot attain the pure mind. All would be just window dressing. With one degree of pure mind, we attain one degree of wisdom. With two degrees of pure mind, we attain two degrees of wisdom, etc. Therefore, practicing accordingly and maintaining and protecting the pure mind, which gives rise to true wisdom, is exceptionally important."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40 The Six Paramitas or Principles The fourth guideline is the Six Principles or Paramitas that are the primary liv ing principles of Bodhisattvas. Each princ iple enco mpasses our whole w ay o f living; for ex ample, th e first of the Six Principles is “Giving.” Some people think of g iving as simply donati ng money. Actually, this is only on e of the infinite kinds of giving. From the appearanc e, giving is sacrificing oneself to giv e to oth ers. However, from its intrinsic nature, g iving is letting go. We can practice giving o f ou r wealth o r physical strength. For example, a home make r keeps house daily provid ing a comf ortable e nviro nment f or th e family. Without prop er u nderstandi ng, this h omemake r may feel these daily chores are repetitive; that washing clothes and c ooki ng meals are borin g.

Not onl y does on e serve the whole family b y keepi ng th e house neat , but one also serves as a role mode l for al l relatives and ne ighbors. In this way, not just one but all beings b enefit. One is thus a family role model for all families. Whether m anaging"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"41 a store or business, being a role model for others is practicing the Bodhisattva Way in guiding sentient beings. The principle of giving can be expanded to the infinite universe and beyond. With this extensive broadmindedness, one is a Mahayana Bodhisattva. Giving is comprised of three categories: wealth, teaching and fearlessness. The giving of wealth includes internal and external wealth. Internal wealth involves all of our mental and physical labors that benefit others. External wealth is the giving of all other things, e.g. money, food, etc. Gaining wealth is the result of giving wealth. The giving of teaching is the willingness to instruct others while not selfishly holding back any knowledge. It is to do one’s best in educating willing students. As a result, one gains intelligence and wisdom. The giving of fearlessness includes soothing away other’s fears and providing a feeling of security. As a result, one gains health and long life. Most people wish for wealth, intelligence, wisdom, health and long life. When there is a good cause, a good reward will follow. One does not receive a reward without first planting the good cause. By practicing all three kinds of giving, one perfectly attains all these rewards. Observing carefully, we will see that there are not many who have all they wish for. Some wealthy employers do not possess great intelligence or wisdom, but have intelligent and wise employees"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"42 working under them, following their instructions. These intelligent and wise employees have cultivated wisdom in their past lives but did not cultivate good fortune. On the other hand, these employers cultivated good fortune but did not cultivate wisdom. Cause and effect may be complex, but not hard to distinguish. Thus, using Buddhist principles to observe society enables one to know how to conduct oneself in the future. In reality, true wisdom is more important than good fortune. Wealth is good fortune, but how one uses and allocates wealth requires a high level of wisdom. Without wisdom, possessing wealth may lead one to create infinite bad karma from bad deeds, thinking one is doing good. Without wisdom, one is unable to distinguish true from false, proper from deviated, right from wrong or beneficial from harmful. Often one is ignorant of having conducted oneself in an erroneous manner. All these principles are explained very clearly in Liao Fan’s Four Lessons . Within good and bad there exists true and false, half and full, right and wrong. From its appearance, what may appear to be a true good deed, due to changes in its nature some time later, can turn out to have been a bad one. On the other hand, what may initially appear to be a bad deed can turn out to have been a good one. Therefore, one needs insight to understand the outcome of all good and bad deeds and"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"43 not to judge them by their initial appearance. One needs a high level of wisdom to understand deeply and to be far-sighted enough to distinguish correctly the truth. The second principle is “Precept Observation,” which also has a broad meaning. One follows the Buddha’s teachings, accords with the customs of society, and abides by the rules and laws of a country. In both the spirit of the law as well as the letter, all rules and laws need to be followed. The third principle is “Patience.” Patience includes long-term patience whether interacting with people, matters or objects. As the Buddha explained in the Diamond Sutra , all dharma is attained from patience and endurance. To succeed in either worldly or spiritual dharma, one must have patience. Without it one cannot attain achievement. Having this patience to endure what others cannot, one achieves what others cannot. Only then will one accomplish great deeds. The fourth principle is “Diligence.” Diligence is seeking focused improvement daily, not trying to advance in many different directions. Advancing with diligence to a certain level, one attains concentration. This concentration does not simply mean cultivating while sitting in a lotus position facing a wall. It is to have a firm hold of one’s mind and not to be influenced by external conditions. This accords with"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"44 the Diamond Sutra , to remain un move d by and unattached t o an y phe nome non.

It is seeing eve rything clearly and knowing that all is intuitive wisdom, th e prajna wisdom. In this way, one will then live happily. For example, when we buy a refr igerator , use and maintain it nicely, it can last at least ten years. During these ten years, there will be improvements and changes in r efrigera tor manufacturing. Will we want to exchang e it for a new one? When ther e is no ne ed for a new one and we c ontinue t o use it, we have concentration.

Lastly, the attainment is to prove within our daily lives that all the teachings and understandings are correct. Lately, I have heard some fellow practitioners mention that lacking a blessing from an Esoteric Master would seem to make one inferior to others. In reality, are these kinds of blessing all that effective? In America, many fellow practitioners were so enthusiastic about this ritual that they would even drive ten hours or more just to find a Master to obtain a consecration. After they came back, I asked them if they had uncovered their wisdom and had fewer afflictions. They honestly shook their heads and said no. I said, if a consecration is achieved by sprinkling a few drops of water on the head, then one might as well go take a shower to receive a great consecration. Not understanding the true characteristics and meanings behind all the rituals reveals a very sad phenomenon in Buddhism. Mr. Nian-Chu Huang who was an Esoteric master, stated very clearly in his commentary of the Infinite Life Sutra , “The consecration is a blessing of compassion and kindness; one’s head symbolizes the act of instilling in the person the outstanding teachings of the Buddha.”"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"47 Chapter Five: The Pure Land School Today, as we practice the Pure Land method, we know that the Infinite Life Sutra is a very important sutra, thus is a supreme Dharma. Passing on the Infinite Life Sutra and the Amitabha Sutra to others brings them a great consecration. Reciting the sutra once is to receive consecration once from all the Buddhas in the ten directions. Reciting the sutra twice is to receive consecration twice from all the Buddhas. Therefore, one needs to understand the method in practicing, to start from the foundation of the Three Conditions. As I said earlier, the first condition is to be filial and respectful toward parents and teachers; to be compassionate and not kill any living being; and to cultivate the Ten Good Conducts. Cultivation begins from here. If one thinks that one cannot accomplish the above, then no matter how one practices, it is only superficial. It is important for one to practice earnestly to accomplish these conditions or one may not attain the true benefits from the Buddha’s teachings. Ultimately, we return to the Pure Land method. Why?

In the Flower Adornment Sutra , we see that Manjusri and Universal Worthy Bodhisattvas sought birth into the Western Pure Land. If the Western Pure Land were not so remarkable, why would these two Bodhisattvas of the Hwa Dzan world want to go to this particular Pure Land? The Infinite Life Sutra explains why one would want to chant Buddha Amitabha’s name and be born into the Pure Land. If one would recite the Infinite Life Sutra more often and listen to lectures on it, one would come to a deeper and more meaningful understanding and cultivation. If we do not wish to spend more time and energy to seek the truth of life and the universe, then following the teachings within this sutra would be sufficient and perfect. Why? In the future, after we are born into the Pure Land, our wisdom, virtuous abilities and enjoyments will be equal to those of Buddha Amitabha.
