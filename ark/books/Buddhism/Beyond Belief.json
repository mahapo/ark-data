Firstly it aims to criti - cally examine the fundamentalist approach to Christianity and thereby highlight its many logical, philosophical and ethical problems. In doing this I hope to be able to provide Buddhists with facts which they can use when Christians attempt to evan - gelize them. is book should make such encounters fairer and hopefully also make it more likely that Buddhists will keep their faith. As it is, many Buddhists know little of their own religion and nothing about Christianity which makes it difficult for them rebut the claims Christians make or answer the questions about Buddhism they ask. e second aim of this book is to help fundamentalist Christians who might read it to understand why some people are not and will never be Christians. Hopefully, this understanding will help them to develop an acceptance of and thereby genuine friendship with Buddhists, rather than relating to them only as either lost souls or potential converts. In order to do this I have raised as many difficult about Christianity as possible. If it appears sometimes that I have been hard on Christianity I hope this will not be interpreted as being motivated by malice. I was a Christian for many years and I still retain a fond regard and even an admiration for some aspects of Christianity. For me, Jesus’ teachings were an important step in my becoming a Buddhist and I think I am a better Buddhist as a result. However, when Christians claim, as many do with such insistence, that their religion alone is true, they must be prepared to answer doubts which others might express about it."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"    e third aim of this book is to awaken in Buddhists a deeper appreciation for their own religion. In some Asian coun - tries Buddhism is thought of an out-of-date superstition while Christianity is seen as a religion which has all the answers. As these countries become more Westernized, Christianity with its ‘modern’ image begins to look increasingly attractive. I think this book will amply demonstrate that Buddhism is able to ask ques - tions of Christianity which it has great difficulties answering and at the same time offer explanations to life’s puzzles which make Christian explanations look rather inadequate. Some Buddhists may object to a book like this, believ - ing that a gentle and tolerant religion like Buddhism should refrain from criticizing other. is is certainly not what the Buddha himself taught. In the Mahaparinibbana Sutta he said that his disciples should be able to “Teach the Dhamma, declare it, establish it, expound it, analyze it, make it clear, and be able by means of the Dhamma to refute false teachings that have arisen.” Subjecting a point of view to careful scrutiny and criti - cism has an important part to play in helping to winnow truth from falsehood so that we can be in a better position to choose between “the two and sixty contending sects.” Criticism of other religions only becomes inappropriate when it is based on a delib - erate misrepresentation or when it descends into an exercise in ridicule and name-calling. I hope I have avoided doing this. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"    hristian rguments for od’s xistence  ll Christians, fundamentalists and liberals, claim that there is an all-knowing, all-loving God who created and controls the universe. Several arguments are used to prove this idea. We will examine each of these arguments and give the Buddhist objections to them. e uthority of the ible When asked to prove that God exists the Christian will point to the Bible and say it is the best proof of God’s existence. e problem is that if we ask a Hindu, a Taoist, a Sikh or a Jew the same question they too will point to their respective holy books as proof of the existence of their gods. Why should we believe the Bible but not the holy books of all the other religions? Using the Bible to prove God’s existence is only valid if we already accept that it alone contains God’s words. However, we have no evidence that this is so. In fact, as we will demonstrate later, there is strong evidence that the Bible is a highly unreliable document. e xistence of the niverse In their attempts to prove God’s existence Christians will some - times say that the universe didn’t just happen, someone must have made it and therefore there must be a creator God. ere is a major flaw in this argument. When it starts to rain we do not ask, “Who is making it rain?” because we know that rain"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"    is not caused by someone but by something — natural phenomena like heat, evaporation, precipitation, etc. When we see smooth stones in a river we do not ask, “Who polished those stones?” because we know that their smooth surface was not caused by someone but by something — natural causes like the abrasive action of water and sand. All of these things have a cause or causes but this need not be a being. It is the same with the universe — it was not brought into being by a god but by natural phenomena like nuclear fis - sion, gravity, inertia, etc. However, even if we insist that a divine being is needed to explain how the universe came into existence, what proof is there that it was the Christian God? Perhaps the Hindu God, the God of Islam or one of the gods worshipped by tribal religions created it. After all, Christianity is not the only religion to claim that there is a creator god or gods. e rgument from esign In response to the above refutation the Christian will maintain that the universe not only exists but that its existence shows perfect design. ere is, a Christian might say, an order and bal - ance in the universe which point to its having been designed by a higher intelligence and that this higher intelligence is God. But as before there are some problems with this argument. Firstly, how does the Christian know that it was his God who is behind creation? Perhaps it was the gods of non-Christian religions who designed and created the universe. Secondly, how does the Christian know that only one God designed everything? In fact, as the universe is so intricate and complex we could expect it"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"    to need the intelligence of several, perhaps dozens, of gods to design it. So if anything the argument from design could be used to prove that there are many gods, not one as Christians claim. Next, we would have to ask whether the universe is really perfectly designed? We must ask this question because it is only natural to expect a perfect God to design a perfect universe. Let us look first at inanimate phenomena to see whether they show perfect design. Rain gives us pure water to drink but sometimes it rains too much and people lose their lives, their homes and their means of livelihood in floods. At other times it doesn’t rain at all and millions die because of drought and famine. Is this perfect design? e mountains give us joy as we see them reaching up into the sky. But landslides and volcanic eruptions have caused havoc and death for centuries. Is this perfect design? e gentle breezes cool us but storms and tornadoes repeatedly cause death and destruction. Is this perfect design? ese and other natural calamities prove that inanimate phenomena do not exhibit perfect design and therefore that they were not created by a perfect God. Now let us look at animate phenomena. At a superficial glance nature seems to be beautiful and harmonious; all crea - tures are provided for and each has its task to perform. However, nature is utterly ruthless as any biologist or careful observer will confirm. To live, each creature has to feed on other creatures and struggle to avoid being eaten by other creatures. In nature there is no room for pity, love or mercy. If a loving God really designed everything, why did such a cruel design result? But the animal kingdom is not only imperfect in the ethical sense; it is also imperfect in that it often goes wrong. Every year millions of babies are born with physical or mental disabilities, are stillborn"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"    or die soon after birth. Why would a perfect creator God design such terrible things? So if there is design in the universe, much of it is either cruel or faulty. is indicates that the universe was not created by a perfect all-loving God. e irst ause rgument Christians will sometimes say that everything has a cause, that there must be a first cause and that God is the first cause. is old argument contains its own refutation because if everything has a first cause then the first cause must also have a cause. ere is another problem with the first cause argument. Logically, there is no good reason to assume that everything had a single first cause. Perhaps six, ten or three hundred causes occurring simultaneously caused everything. And as before, even if we accept the necessity of a first cause, what proof is there that it was the Christian God? None. iracles Fundamentalist Christians claim that miracles are sometimes performed in God’s name and that this proves he exists. is is an appealing argument until it is looked at a little more closely. While Christians are quick to claim that because of their prayers the blind could see, the deaf could hear and crooked limbs were straightened, they are very slow in producing hard evidence to back up their claims. In fact, fundamentalist, evangelical and born again Christians are so anxious to prove that miracles have occurred at their prayer meetings that the truth often gets lost in a flood of wild claims, extravagant boasts and sometimes even conscious lies."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"    However, it is true that things which are unusual or difficult to explain do sometimes happen during religious events — but not just for Christians. Hindus, Muslims, Taoists, Jews etc. all claim that their God or gods sometimes perform miracles. Christianity certainly does not have a monopoly on miraculous happenings. So if miracles performed in God’s name prove that he exists, then miracles performed in the name of the numerous other gods must likewise prove that they exist too Fundamentalist Christians try to deny this fact by claim - ing that when miracles occur in other religions they are done through the power of the Devil. Perhaps the best way to counter this claim is to quote the Bible. When Jesus healed the sick his enemies accused him of doing this through the power of the Devil. He answered by saying that healing the sick results in good and if the Devil went around doing good he would destroy himself (Mk :-). Surely the same could be said for the mira - cles performed by Hindus, Jains, Jews or Sikhs. If the miracles they do result in good how can they be the work of the Devil? e rgument for od’s ecessity Fundamentalist Christians often claim that only by believing in God can people have the strength to deal with life’s problems and therefore that belief in God is necessary. is claim is appar - ently supported by numerous books written by Christians who have endured and overcome various crises through their faith in God. Some of these books make highly inspiring reading so the claim that one can cope with problems only with God’s help sounds rather convincing — until we look a little more deeply."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"    If this claim is true, we would expect that most non- Christians in the world to lead lives of emotional distress, con - fusion and hopelessness while most Christian through their faith in God would be able to unfailingly deal with their problems and never need to seek help from counsellors or psychiatrists. It is clear however, that people from non-Christian religions and even those with no religion are just as capable of dealing with life’s crises as Christians are — sometimes even better. It is also sometimes true that people who are devout Christians lose their faith in God after being confronted with serious personal prob - lems. Consequently, the claim that belief in God is necessary to cope with and overcome problems is baseless. e “ry and isprove” rgument When Christians find they cannot prove their God’s existence with doubtful facts or faulty logic they may switch tactics and say that perhaps you can’t prove God exists, but you can’t disprove it either. is of course is quite true. You cannot prove that God doesn’t exist — but you can’t you prove that the gods of Taoism, Hinduism, African spirit worship and a dozen other religions don’t exist either. In other words, despite all the hyperbole, the extravagant claims and the confident proclamations, there is no more evidence for the existence of the Christian God than there is for the gods worshipped in all the other religions. e estimony After everything else has failed the Christian may finally try to convince us that God exists by appealing to our emotions. Such"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"    a person will say, perhaps quite truthfully, “I used to be unhappy and discontented but after giving myself to God I am happy and at peace with myself.” Such testimonies can be deeply mov - ing but what do they prove? ere are millions of people whose lives became equally happy and meaningful after they embraced Buddhism, Hinduism or Islam. Likewise, there are no doubt many people whose lives have not changed for the better after they became Christians — the same weaknesses and problems sometimes remain. So this argument, like all the others, does not prove the existence of the Christian God. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"    hy od annot xist  e have seen that the arguments used to prove God’s exist - ence are inadequate. We will now demonstrate that logi - cally an all-loving, all-knowing and all-powerful God such as the one in which Christians have faith cannot exist. e roblem of ree ill For the religious life to be meaningful we must have free will, we must be able to choose between good and evil, right and wrong. If we do not have free will we cannot be held responsible for what we do. According to Christians, God is all knowing — he knows all the past, all the present and all the future. If this is so then he must know everything we do long before we do it. is means that our whole life must be predetermined and that we act not according to the free exercise of our wills but according to our predetermined natures. If we are predetermined to be good we will be good and if we are predetermined to be evil we will be evil. We will act not according to our will or choice but accord - ing to the way God has already foreseen we will act. Although Christians will insist that we do have free will, God’s omnis - cience simply makes this logically impossible. e Bible also makes it clear that everything people do, good or evil, is all due to the will of God (e.g.  ess :-; Rom :-; Rom :). If people are evil it is because God has chosen to make them evil (Rom :-) and caused them to disobey him (Rom :). If they do not understand God’s message it is because"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"    he has made their minds dull (Rom :) and caused them to be stubborn (Rom :). God prevents the Gospel from being preached in certain areas (Act :-) and he fixes long before it will happen when a person will be born and when he or she will die (Act :). ose who were going to be saved were chosen by God before the beginning of time (II Tim :). If a person has faith and is thereby saved, their faith comes from God, not from any effort or decision on their part (Eph :-). Now one may ask “If we can only do what God predetermines us to do, how can he hold us responsible for their actions?” e Bible has an answer for this question. But one of you will say to me: “If this is so, how can God find fault with anyone? For who can resist God’s will?” But who are you, my friend, to answer God back? A clay pot does not ask the man who made it: “Why did you make me like this?” After all, the man who makes the pot has the right to use the clay as he wishes, and to make two pots from one lump of clay, one for special occasions and one for ordinary use. And the same is true of what God has done (Rom :-). So apparently in Christianity a person’s life and destiny are due purely to the whim of God and as mere humans we have no right to complain about what he has decided for us. e idea that all our actions are predetermined is quite consistent with the idea of an all-knowing God but it makes nonsense of the concept of trying to do good or avoid evil. e roblem of vil Perhaps the most potent argument against the existence of an all- powerful and all-loving God is the undeniable fact that there is"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"    so much pain and suffering in the world. If there really is a God of love who has unlimited power why doesn’t he put an end to all this evil? Christians try to answer this difficult question in several ways. Firstly they will say that evil is caused by humans not God and that if only we would follow God’s commandments there would be no pain, evil or suffering. However, while it is true that evils such as war, rape, murder and exploitation can be blamed on humans, they can hardly be blamed for the mil - lions who die each year in earthquakes, floods, epidemics and accidents, all of which are natural events. In fact, according to the Bible, the germs that cause hideous diseases like TB, polio, cholera, leprosy etc. and all the misery, deformity and suffering to which they give rise, were created by God before he created man (Gen. :-). So it is not correct to say that evil and suf - fering are caused by humankind. Another way Christians will try to explain away evil is to say that it is God’s punishment for those who do not follow his commandments. However this implies that terrible things only happen to bad people which are certainly not true. We often hear of painful sickness or disasters befalling good people including good Christians and likewise we often hear of really bad people who seem to have nothing but good fortune and success. So it cannot be said that suffering and evil are God’s way of punish - ing sinners. Next, Christians will say that God allows evil to exist in the world because he wants to give us the freedom to choose good over evil and thereby be worthy of salvation. Evil, they will say, exists to test us. At first this seems to be a good explana - tion. If a man sees someone being beaten up by a bully he has"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"    a choice between turning away (doing wrong) or deciding to help the victim (doing right). If he decides to help then he has been tested and found good. However, as we have seen before, an all-knowing God must already know what choices a person will make so what is the point of testing us? Also, even if suffer - ing and evil exist to test us couldn’t an all-loving God think of a less cruel and painful way to do this? Further, it seems rather unloving and unfair to allow pain to be inflicted on one person just so that another can have the opportunity to choose between good and evil. Some fundamentalist Christians will try to free God from responsibility for evil by saying that it was not created by him but by the Devil. is may be true but again if God is so loving why doesn’t he simply prevent the Devil from causing suffering and doing evil? In any case, who created the Devil in the first place? Surely it was God. By this stage the Christian will start to get a bit desper - ate and shift the argument from logic to pragmatism. He will say that even though there is suffering in the world we can use it as an opportunity to develop courage and patience. is is undoubtedly true but it still does not explain why an all-loving God allows babies to die of cancer, innocent bystanders to be killed in accidents and leprosy victims to suffer deformity, mis - ery and pain. In fact, the existence of so much unnecessary pain and suffering in the world is very strong evidence that there is no all-loving, all-powerful God. hy reate ? Christians claim that God is perfect. To be perfect means to be"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"    complete in every way. Now if God really did create the uni - verse this would prove that he was not perfect. Let us examine why. Before God created the universe there was nothing — no sun, no earth, no people, no good or evil, no pain — nothing but God who was, according to Christians, perfect. So if God was perfect and nothing but perfection existed, what motivated him to create the universe and thus bring imperfection into being? Was it because he was bored and wanted something to do? Was it because he was lonely and wanted someone to pray to him? Christians will say that God created everything because of his love of man but this is impossible. God could not love humans before he created them any more than a woman could love her children before she had conceived them. Further, God’s need to create indicates that he was dissatisfied in some way and therefore not perfect. Christians might then say that God cre - ated spontaneously and without need or desire. However, this would mean that the whole universe came into being without purpose or forethought and therefore prove that God was not a loving creator. e roblem of the idden od Fundamentalist Christians claim that God wants us to believe in him so that we can be saved but if this is so why doesn’t he simply appear and perform a miracle so that everyone will see and believe? Christians will say that God wants us to believe in him out of faith, not because we see him with our own eyes. However, according to the Bible, in the past God performed the most awesome miracles and often intervened dramatically"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"    in human affairs so that people would know his presence. If he did so in the past, why doesn’t he do so now? Christians will say that God does perform miracles today (healing, solving personal problems etc) but being stubborn and evil most people still refuse to believe. However, these so-called miracles are individual and minor and leave much room for doubt. If God performed a really impressive miracle which could have no other possible explanation then most people certainly would believe. e Bible tells us that when the Israelites wandered in the desert for forty years God fed them by making food fall regu - larly from the sky (Ex :). During the ’s, several million Ethiopian Christians died slowly and painfully from starvation due to a prolonged drought. At that time God had the oppor - tunity to prove his existence, his power and his love by making food fall from the sky as the Bible claims he did in the past. Buddhists would say that God did not manifest his presence at that time because he does not exist. "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"    od or e uddha  hile Christians look to God as their lord and creator, Buddhists look to the Buddha as their inspiration and ideal. Although Christians have never seen God they claim to know him by communicating with him through prayer and through feeling his presence. ey also claim that they can know God’s will by reading his words in the Bible. As Buddhists nei - ther prays to nor acknowledge God the only way they can get an idea of what he is like is by reading the Bible. However when Buddhists look at what the Bible says about God they are often very shocked. ey find that how God is portrayed there is pro - foundly different from how they hear Christians describe him. While Buddhists reject the Christian concept of God because it seems to be illogical and unsubstantiated, they also reject it because it seems so much lower than their own ideal, the Buddha. We will now examine what the Bible says about God and com - pare it to what the Tipitaka (the Buddhist sacred scriptures) say about the Buddha. hysical ppearance What does God look like? e Bible says that he created man in his own image (Gen :) so from this we can assume he looks something like a human being. e Bible tells us that God has hands (Ex :), arms (Deut :), fingers (Ps :) and a face (Deut :).

However, although God seems to have some human character - istics he does at the same time look not unlike the demons and fierce guardians one often sees in Indian and Chinese temples. For example, he has flames coming out of his body. A fire issues from his presence and burns his enemies on every side (Ps :). Our God comes and shall not keep silent, before him a fire burns and around him fierce storms rage (Ps :). Now the people complained about their hardships in the hearing of the Lord, and when he heard them his anger was aroused. en fire from the Lord burned among them and con - sumed some of the outskirts of the camp (Num :). When God is angry, which seems to be quite often, smoke and fire come out of his mouth and noise. e earth trembled and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains shook, they trembled because he was angry. Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it (Ps :-).

Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved. eir faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a man, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle. Such were their faces. eir wings were spread out upward; each had two wings, one touching the wing of another creature on either side, and two wings cover - ing its body. Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went. e appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches.

Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel (Ezek :-). Fundamentalist Christians often claim that the many-armed and fierce-faced gods in Hindu and Taoist temples and claim that they are devils rather than gods. But the Bible describes God as having a very similar appearance. For example he carries weapons. In that day the Lord will punish with his sword, his fierce, great and powerful sword (Is :). e sun and moon stood still in the heavens at the glint of your flying arrows, at the lightning of your flashing spear. In wrath you strode through the earth and in your anger you threshed the nations (Haba :-). e Lord thundered from heaven, the voice of the Most High resounded. He shot his arrows and scattered the enemies (Ps :-). But God will shoot them with arrows, suddenly they will be struck down (Ps :). en the Lord will appear over them, his arrows will flash like lightning. e sovereign Lord will sound the trumpet (Zech :).

It is obvious from these quotes that God has a savage and frightening appear - ance; a conclusion verified again by the Bible where people are described as being utterly terrified by his appearance. Serve the Lord with fear and trembling, kiss his feet or else he will get angry and you will perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled (Ps :). erefore I am terrified at his presence. When I think of him I am in dread of him, God has made my heart faint. e Almighty has terrified me (Job :). Jesus says God is a truly frightening deity (e.g. Lk :-). e Bible also very correctly says that where there is fear there cannot be love (Jn, :) and so if God creates fear in people it is difficult to know how he can genuinely be loved at the same time. What did the Buddha look like? Being human the Buddha had a body like any ordinary person. However, the Tipitaka frequently speak of his great personal beauty. He is handsome, good-looking, pleasant to see, of most beautiful complexion, his form and countenance is like Brahma’s, his appearance is beautiful (Digha Nikaya, Sutta No.). He is handsome, inspiring faith, with calm senses and mind tranquil, composed and controlled, like a per - fectly tamed elephant (Anguttara Nikaya, Sutta No.).

God carries weapons because he has to kill his enemies and be - cause he controls people with violence and threats. e Buddha by contrast, showed enmity to no one and was able to control people by reasoning with them.

Once, as I sat listening to the Lord teach Dhamma a certain disciple coughed and one of his fel - lows tapped him on the knee and said, “Silence, sir, make no noise.

But Buddhists also reject the Christian God because, if the Bible is correct, he appears to be so imperfect. All of the negative emotions which most cultured people consider unacceptable seem to be found in God. Let us examine how the Bible describes God’s character. e emotion which is associated with God more than any other is jealousy. He even admits that he is jealous. For the Lord is a devouring fire, a jealous God (Deut :). Nothing makes God more jealous than when people worship other gods and he tells them that they must even kill our own children if they do this. If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, daughter, the wife of your bosom or the friend of your own soul, entices you secretly, saying, “Let us go and serve other gods” which neither you nor your fathers have known, some of the gods of the people that are around you whether near or far, from one end of the earth to the other, you shall not yield to him or listen to him, nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"    him, nor shall you conceal him, but you shall kill him.

See, the day of the Lord is coming — a cruel day, with wrath and fierce anger, to make the land desolate and destroy the sinners within it (Is :). God is angry every day (Ps :). e Lord will cause men to hear his majestic voice and will make them see his arm coming down with raging anger and consuming fire (Is :). His anger will burn against you and he will destroy you from the face of the land (Deut :). God tells us to love but he is described as hating and being filled with abhorrence. You hate all those who do wrong. You destroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the Lord abhors (Ps :-). He is described as hating many other things as well as people (see Deut :, Mala :, Lev :).

Behold, your God will come with vengeance (Is :). e Lord is avenging and wrathful, the Lord takes vengeance on his adversaries and holds wrath for his enemies (Nahum :). For we know him who said, “It is mine to avenge; I will repay”, and again, “e Lord will judge his people”. It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God (Heb :-).

What is the point of worshipping a God who is full of the very mental defilements which we our - selves are striving to overcome? During the forty years after his enlightenment, the Buddha urged people to give up anger, jealousy and intolerance and never once in all that time did he fail to act in perfect accordance with what he taught to others. e Lord acts as he speaks and speaks as he acts.

As we have seen, God is quite capable of hatred and so not surprisingly that he is often involved in war. e Lord is a man of war (Ex :). e Lord your God is in your midst, a warrior who gives victory (Zeph :). e Lord goes forth like a mighty man, like a man of war he stirs up his fury, he cries out, he shouts aloud, he shows himself mighty against the enemy (Is :).

I will make my arrows drunk with blood while my sword devours flesh: the blood of the slain and the captives, the heads of the enemy leaders (Deut :-).

Even today there is a distinctly militaris - tic flavor about certain Christian churches. e Salvation Army with its motto “Blood and Fire”; the Jesus Army, the hymns that speak about “Onward Christian soldiers marching as to war”; the saying “Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition”, etc. e Bible contains dozens of examples of God helping his devotees to capture cities, slaughter civilian populations and defeat armies (for example Num :-, Num :-, Deut :-, Deut :-, Josh :-, etc.). Concerning prisoners of war God says: And you shall destroy all the peoples that the Lord your God gives over to you, your eye shall not pity them (Deut :). When the Lord your God gives them over to you and you defeat them you must utterly destroy them and show no mercy to them (Deut :). If military leaders do such things today they are considered war criminals. Even Christians are often shocked when they read passages like these. Buddhists simply feel that they justify their rejection of God and their faith in the Buddha. What was the Buddha’s attitude to war? ere is of course no example of him ever praising war, encouraging it, or going to war himself. On the contrary, he urged all to live in peace and harmony and is described as being like this; He is a reconciler of those who are in conflict and an encourager of those who are already united, rejoicing in peace, loving peace, delighting in peace, he is one who speaks in praise of peace (Digha Nikaya, Sutta No.)."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"    e et an xample by being a an of eace Abandoning killing, the monk Gotama lives refraining from killing, he is without stick or sword and he lives with care, compassion and sympathy for others (Digha Nikaya, Sutta No.). But the Buddha was not content with merely speaking in favor of peace or with being peaceful himself. He actively promoted peace by trying to stop war. When his relatives were about to go to war over the waters of the Rohini River, the Buddha did not take sides, urge them on, give them advice on tactics or tell them to show no mercy to their adversaries as God did. Instead courageously he stood between the two factions and brought them to their senses by asking; “What is more valuable, blood or water?” e soldiers replied, “Blood is more valuable, sir.” en the Buddha said, “en is it not unbecoming to spill blood just for the sake of water?” Both sides dropped their weapons and peace was restored (Dhammapada Atthakata Book ,). e Buddha had put aside hatred and filled his mind with love and compassion so approving of war was impossible for him. dea of ustice Justice is the quality of being fair and one who is just acts fairly and in accordance with what is right. However, ideas about what is fair and right differ from time to time and from person to person.

I the Lord am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sins of the fathers to the third or fourth genera - tion of those who hate me (Deut :). is is known as collective punishment; punishing a whole fam - ily or group for the crime committed by one of its members. Collective punishment is universally condemned today but God seems to consider it quite fair and just. God tells us that even minor offences should be punished by death. For example he says that those who work on Sunday should be stoned to death. Once a man was found collecting firewood on Sunday and God said to Moses and the people who caught the man: “e man must die. e whole assembly must stone him outside the camp.” So the assembly took him outside the camp and stoned him to death as the Lord com - manded Moses (Num :-). To demand capital punishment for such a minor offence seems to be a monstrous injustice. God’s idea of justice does not seem to embrace the idea that the punishment should fit the crime. We are told that all who do not love God will suffer eternal punish - ment in hell. ere are many kind, honest and good people who do not believe in God and they will all go to hell. Is this fair and just? God apparently thinks so."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"    Was the Buddha just? He had attained the freedom of enlightenment and taught others how they too could attain this same freedom. Unlike God, he was not primarily a lawgiver, a judge, or one who metes out punishment. He was a teacher. In all his dealings with people he was fair, mild and merciful and he encouraged his followers to act in a like manner. If someone did wrong he said that one should not rush to judge or punish them. When you are living together in harmony, a fellow monk might commit an offence, a transgression. But you should not rush to condemn him, the issue must be care - fully examined first (Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta No. ). In addition, when a person is being examined one should remain uninfluenced by bias or partiality and should look at both sides of the case. Not by passing hasty judgments does one become just, a wise person is one who investigates both sides. One who does not judge others arbitrarily but passes judg - ment impartially and in accordance with the facts, that person is a guardian of the law and is rightly called just (Dhammapada -). As for punishment, the Buddha would have considered stoning someone to death or any other form of capital punishment to be utterly unacceptable. He himself was always ready to forgive. Once a man called Nigrodha abused the Buddha but later realized his mistake, confessed it to the Buddha and asked for his forgiveness. Full of understanding and compassion the Buddha said:"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"    Indeed, Nigrodha, transgression overcame you when through ignorance, blindness and evil you spoke to me like that.

To the Buddha the proper response to faults was not the threat to punish but educa - tion and forgiveness. He says: By three things the wise can be known. What three? ey see their faults as they are. When they sees them they correct them and when another confesses a fault the wise forgive it as they should (Anguttara Nikaya, Book of rees, Sutta No.). ttitude to isease Disease, sickness and plagues have been the scourge of human - kind for centuries, causing untold suffering and misery. e Bible shows us that God has always considered disease to be a useful way of expressing his anger and exercising his vengeance.

He used this affliction to punish men, women, children and babies for the sin of one man. Later he caused the first-born of every male child die.

Countless thousands of men, boys and innocent babies were killed by God because Pharaoh would not obey him. In many places in the Bible God threatens to inflict terrible diseases on those who do not follow his commandments. e Lord will plague with diseases until he has destroyed you...the Lord will strike you with wasting disease, with fever and inflammation...(Deut :-). e Lord will inflict you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors, festering sores, and with itch, from which you cannot be cured (Deut :). e Lord will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants, harsh and prolonged disasters and severe and lingering illness. He will bring upon you all the disasters of Egypt that you dreaded and they will cling to you. e Lord will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster (Deut :-). Sometimes God even inflicts hideous diseases on people just to test their faith. To test Job he allowed all his children to be killed (Job :-) and Job himself to be struck with a terrible disease (Job :-). So unbearable was Job’s grief and suffering that he began to wish he had never been born (Job :-).

Obviously, God also sees illness, sickness and disease as useful way and of demonstrating the extent of his power. Now let us have a look at the Buddha’s attitude to sickness. He saw sickness and disease as a part of the general suffering that he came to free humankind from. us he was called “the compassionate physician”. ere are no examples of the Buddha ever having caused people to become diseased in order to punish them or because he was angry at them. He rightly understood that for as long as we have a body we will be susceptible to dis - ease and he encouraged all to attain Nirvana and be forever free from suffering. But while he tried to cut the problem at the root he also took practical steps to comfort the sick and restore them to health. Rather than inflict diseases on people as God did, he gave advice on how to help and comfort the sick. With five qualities one is worthy to nurse the sick. What five? One can prepare the correct medicine; one knows what is good for the patient and offers it, and what is not good one does not offer; one nurses the sick out of love not out of desire for gain; one is unmoved by excrement, urine, vomit and spittle; and from time to time one can instruct, inspire, gladden and satisfy the sick with talk on Dhamma (Anguttara Nikaya, Book of Fives, Sutta No.). e Buddha not only taught this but acted in conformity to his own teaching.

When the Buddha saw people with diseases, out of compassion he did all he could to restore them to health. reating vil God created all that is good but because he created everything he must have also created all that is evil. He himself says: I am the Lord and there is no other. I form the light and I create the darkness, I make the good and I make evil (Is :-). When we think of nature and remember that God is supposed to have created everything we understand the meaning of these words. Leprosy germs cause untold misery and they were created by God. Tuberculosis germs kill and deform millions of humans each year and they too were created by God. He created the plague bacteria, the fleas and the rats that together cause bubonic plague and which have killed perhaps as many as a hundred mil - lion people throughout the centuries. In , , people died of the plague in London alone. No doubt all this is what God means when he says he created darkness and evil. But God tells us that he also created other forms of evil as well. He says: When disaster comes to a city, has not the Lord caused it? (Amos :)."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"    is undoubtedly refers to the earthquakes, fires, social strife, wars and other forms of evil which periodically afflict human - kind’s towns and cities.

And this Dhamma has brought only light, good and gentleness everywhere it has spread. acrifices In Old Testament times when people broke God’s command - ments he would get angry and the only way the sinner could make atonement and soothe God’s anger was to sacrifice an animal.

He is to remove the crop with its contents and throw it to the east side of the altar, where the ashes are.

But not all the sacrifices God demanded were animals; sometimes he demanded even human sacrifices. He once said to Abraham: Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about (Gen :). Abraham took his son to the place God indicated, built an altar, laid his son on it and then took up the knife. Just as he was about to slit his own son’s throat, he was stopped by an angel (Gen : ). Presumably, Abraham was a good devotee because he blindly, unquestioningly and willingly did what God told him to do, even to the extent of preparing to butcher his own son. In later centuries, humankind’s sins became so bad that the sacrifice of mere animals could no longer appease God’s anger. He required a greater, a more valuable sacrificial victim — his own son Jesus. Once again it was the blood of a victim which most atoned for sin and which is able to reconcile the sinners with God. us modern born again and evangelical Christians often say that their “sins have been washed away by the blood of Jesus”.

Christians believe that Jesus’ sacrificial blood will wash away their sins just as Indians at the time of the Buddha believed that their sins could be washed away by bathing in holy rivers. e Buddha criticized the Indian idea just as he would have criticized the Christian idea if he had known about it. To believe that blood, water or any other external things can purify the heart did not make sense to the Buddha.

Someone might have a strong love for their own country but a burning hatred for another country. ough we may love someone deeply, we may, due to changed circum - stances, grow indifferent or even hateful towards them. is is the lower less developed type of love which ordinary people feel. But there is a higher, more universal type of love than this. is higher type of love is called metta in Buddhism and agape in Christianity and is well described in the Buddhist texts and also in the Bible. In Corinthians we read: Love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud, it is not rude, it is not self- seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs ( Cor :-). Does God have this higher type of love? Let us have a look. We are told that love is patient. Patience is defined as the ability to wait calmly for a long time, to control oneself when angered, especially at foolishness or slowness. We have already seen that God gets angry every day (Ps :) and that he gets angry very quickly (Ps :). Obviously he has very little patience. We are told that love is kind. Is God kind? Please take up your Bible, turn to Deuteronomy :- and read God describ - ing in his own words just how cruel he can be. is shocking passage proves beyond all doubt that God is capable of truly ter - rible cruelty. Obviously he is not always very kind."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"    We are told that love does not envy. Envy is of course, very similar to jealousy and God often describes himself as fiercely jealous. He says: For the Lord your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God (Deut :). We are told that love does not boast and is not proud. Is God like this? Certainly the Bible does not give us the impression that he is a modest and retiring deity. He spends a lot of time telling Job how great he is (Job :) and ends by boasting of himself that: He looks down on all that are haughty, he is king over all that are proud (Job :). Next we are told that love is not easily angered. We have already seen that God is very easily angered. Serve the Lord with fear and trembling, kiss his feet or else he will get angry and you will perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled (Ps :). Finally we are told that love does not keep a record of wrongs that are done, that is, it soon forgives and forgets. Does God keep a record of wrongs? He tells us that he will punish the children, grandchildren and even great-grandchildren of those who sin (Deut :). In order to do this he must keep a record of the wrongs that have been committed and long remember them. Jesus tells us that God will never forgive those who insult the Holy Ghost (Lk :).

In short, he keeps a record for eternity of the wrongs which have been done. Quite clearly, God does not have the highest type of love. What about the Buddha? Did he exhibit the highest type of love? e first characteristic of this highest kind of love is patience and there is not one incident recorded in the Tipitaka of the Buddha being impatient. Even when he was abused he remained calm and unruffled. His every action displays a calm, strong patience. When Asurinda cursed and abused him he calmly replied: He who abuses his abuser is the worse of the two. To refrain from retaliation is to win a battle hard to win. If one knows that the other person is angry but refrains from anger oneself, one does what is best for oneself and the other person also. One is a healer of both (Samyutta Nikaya, Chapter Seven, Sutta No.). Just as he was always patient the Buddha was also free from anger. Even when his cousin Devadatta tried to murder him he displayed only pity and tolerance. We are also told that love is kind. Was the Buddha kind? Again there is not the slightest hint of the Buddha being any - thing other than kind and compassionate — not only to those who accepted his teachings but also to the followers of other faiths, not only to the good but also to the evil, not only to humans but also to animals.

Vacchagatta said to the Lord, “I have heard it said that you say that charity should only be given to you, not to other teachers, to your disciples, not to the disciples of other religions.” en the Lord said, “ose who say this are not reporting my words, they misrepresent me and tell lies.

When one actually asks to have a look at these “amazing prophe - cies” one can see that they are usually so vague and general that they could be interpreted to correspond to virtually any event. For example, the Bible says that before Jesus return “there will be wars and rumors of wars” (Matt :) and as there are numer - ous conflicts going on now this is a sign that Jesus is just about to come again. e problem with this prophecy is that it could refer to any period in world history because there are always a few wars occurring somewhere. When the prophecies are more explicit and clear they are usually wrong. For example, the Holy Ghost predicted to Agabus that there would soon be a world wide famine (Acts, , .) But there is no record that such a thing ever happened. Christians also claim that all the events in Jesus’ life were prophesied in the Bible long before he was born and the fact that these prophecies came true proves that he really was the Messiah. Let us have a look at some of these supposed prophecies and see if they are as accurate as Christians claim. In the book of Isaiah in the Old Testament it says: For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the gov - ernment will be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called ‘Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace’. Of the increase of his govern - ment and of peace there will be no end. (Is :-). is is supposed to be a prophecy foretelling the birth of Jesus."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"    But does it? Other than being born no event mentioned here ever happened to Jesus. e government was not on his shoulders, he was never called nor did he call himself by the titles mentioned here and there has been no more peace since he was born than there was before. is is a fairly good example of the “amazing prophecies” of Christianity. Before Jesus’ birth an angel is sup - posed to have prophesied that, e Lord God will make him a king, as his ancestor David was, and he will be the king of the descendants of Jacob forever (Lk :-). But if what the Bible says is true David could not possibly have been Jesus’ ancestor because God, not Joseph, was Jesus’ real father. Further, David was a king in a political sense while Jesus never became a king in this way or in any other way similar to David. And finally, the descendants of Jacob (i.e. the Jews) never accepted Jesus as their king — politically, spiritually or in any other way — and have refused to accept him to this day. So as before this prophecy is wrong on every point. Again in Isaiah it says: He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth. (Isa :-). is is supposed to prophesize that when Jesus was attacked by his opponents that he would not retaliate. But in the Gospels Jesus is portrayed as robustly defending himself against criticism and loudly condemning his enemies. He cursed and criticized the Pharisees when they opposed him and according to John :- he was anything but silent at his trial."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"    When the Romans crucified people they would nail them to a cross, let them hang there for some time and then finally break their legs, thereby increasing the poor victims’ pain and killing them. According to the Bible, when the Romans came to break Jesus’ legs he was already dead and so they did not bother (Jn :-). is, so Christians claim, was prophesied centuries before Jesus in Psalm : where it says that God will not let even one bone of the Messiah’s body be broken. Unfortunately Christians have overlooked a very important fact. Although the bones in Jesus legs may not have been broken, the bones in his hands and feet definitely were. When the nails were driven into Jesus hands and feet they must have broken or crushed several of the metacarpal bones. Christians claim that Jesus died and on the third day rose from the dead and of course they claim that this was prophesied before it happened. e supposed prophecy says: For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly, so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth (Matt :). But like the others this prophecy is wrong. Jesus died on Friday (Good Friday) and supposedly rose from the dead early on Sunday morning (Easter Sunday). Even a child can see this is not three days and three nights as the prophecy says — but one day and two nights. Another problem is that just before Jesus died he turned to the two criminals crucified with him and said “I assure you, today you will be in Paradise with me.” (Lk :).

But it is not just prophecies about Jesus that are wrong, the prophecies he himself made were also wrong. Fundamentalist and evangelical Christians are always claiming that the end of the world is coming soon. Where do they get this bizarre idea from? ey get it from Jesus. He believed and explicitly taught that the world would end within his own lifetime or very soon afterwards. I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened (Lk :-). By “this generation” he was obviously referring to the people he was addressing. On another occasion he again told the people who stood listening to him that some of them would still be alive when the end of the world came. I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom (Matt :). On every one of these points Jesus’ prophecies proved to be wrong. e people who lived at his time have been dead for , years and the world has not ended nor has Jesus returned. Jesus’ dis - ciples finished going through all the cities in Israel within a few years of Jesus’ death and he has still not returned. ese and other examples prove that most of the supposed prophecies about and by Jesus are false.

We will examine one well-known example of this. Several hundred years before Jesus the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew into Greek, the language of the day. When a passage in Isaiah which prophesizes that the Messiah will be born of a young woman (Is :) was translated, the word for young woman ( almah ) was mistranslated as virgin ( parthenas ). When the authors of the Gospels read this they thought that to qualify to be the Messiah Jesus’ mother had to be a virgin and so they fabricated the story of the virgin birth. In fact it only became necessary to invent this story because of a mistranslation. So it is not that prophecies foretold events in Jesus’ life but rather that events were fabricated to fit into prophecies. e irth of esus We often hear fundamentalist born again and evangelical Christians boast that no one has ever found a mistake in the Bible, just as we will often hear them claim that the Bible is the inspired word of God and therefore infallible. Considering how carefully they read their Bibles it is difficult to know how such claims can be made, much less believed. Let us have a look at what the Bible says about the birth of Jesus. In one place we are told that news of Jesus’ impending birth was conveyed to Joseph, Jesus’ father, in a dream (Matt :). en in another we are told that the news was given to Mary, Jesus’ mother, by an angel (Lk :).

Was Jesus born at home (Matt :-) or was he born in a manger at the back of an inn (Lk :)? Next we come to Jesus’ ancestry. We have two lists of all Jesus’ ances - tors on his father’s side but when we look at the names in these we find almost no correspondence between them. ey do not even agree about the name of Jesus’ grandfather.

Jesus is justly famous for the parables he used to illustrate his ideas but at the same time he often failed to make his meaning clear. Sometimes this was because he himself was unclear about his ideas and at other times it seems that he was just a poor communicator. What is even more strange is that Jesus seems to have sometimes delib - erately obscured his message. And when his disciples asked him what the parable meant, he said; to you it has been given to know the secrets of the Kingdom of God: but for others they are in parables, so that seeing they may not see, and hear - ing they may not understand (Lk :-; Mk :-). But they did not understand this saying, and it was con - cealed from them, that they could not perceive it: and they were afraid to ask him about this saying (Lk :). Add to this deliberate obscurity the numerous contradictory ideas in Jesus’ teachings and it is not hard to imagine why his disciples fell into disagreement as soon as he died. In the Epistles there are constant references to the bickering and squabbling between the various factions amongst the early Christians. Paul complained that all the churches in Asia turned against him ( Tim :) and that they refused to take his side in some theological argument ( Tim :-). He tells us of his squabble with Peter and the elders of the church in Jerusalem (Gal :-), of how he was snubbed by the church at Philippi ( ess :-), and of course he accused his rivals of not having real faith ( ess :-), of teach - ing “another Christ” and of not really knowing God (Tit :-)."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"    John bitterly complained that his opponents threw his supporters out of the church (John :-).

What were the early Christians squabbling over? Just about everything. But one of the numerous points of disagreement between them seems to have been on the issue of whether it was necessary to be circumcised (Rom :-, Gal :-, Gal :-, Phil. :-, Col. :-). Paul was against it and called those who disagreed with him “dogs” (Phil :), said that he hoped that they would go all the way and castrate themselves (Gal :) and he warned other Christians to keep away from them (Tit :). All this is reminiscent of modern Christians. While confidently proclaiming that they alone have the truth there is almost no agreement between them about what that truth is. ey have split into hundreds of mutually hostile denominations, sects, cults and churches and can’t even sit down with each other and worship the same God together.

And even after his public ministry started there is great confusion about what happened and when. For instance, the Gospel of John claims that the cleansing of the temple took place at the beginning of Jesus’ ministry (Jn :-), but the Gospel of Luke claims the cleansing took place at the end (Lk :-). In one place we are told that Jesus stayed in Peter’s house and then healed a leper (Mk :-), while in another we are told that he healed the leper and then went in Peter’s house (Matt :-, :). On one hand we are told that the centurion spoke personally to Jesus (Matt :); in a complete contradiction to this we are told that the centurion sent people on his behalf to speak to Jesus (Lk :). In the Gospel of Mark we are told that Jesus left Tyre and passed through Sidon on his way to the Sea of Galilee (Mk :). A look at any map of Israel will show that this is quite impossible as Sidon is in another direction altogether. Christians will reluctantly admit these mistakes but say that they are minor and of no significance. Perhaps so, but they do prove that the Bible is not infallible and if the Bible makes mistakes about what Jesus did, it could just as easily make mis - takes about what he said. But even when we look at very impor - tant events in Jesus’ life we find confusion. Let us have a look at the Last Supper. According to the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus’ Last Supper took place on the Jewish holy day of Passover (Matt :-, Mk :-, Lk :-). e Gospel of John on the other hand claims that it took place on the day before Passover (Jn :).

If they"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"    couldn’t even remember the day of the Last Supper how do we know that they remembered Jesus’ teachings correctly? e rial Now we will have a look at that most important event in the life of Jesus, his trial. As described in the Bible the trial is predictably full of contradictions but it also raises many questions which are difficult to answer. e trial and the events leading up to it are usually described by Christians like this. Jesus entered Jerusalem riding on a donkey to the acclaim of the population of the city. He was arrested by the henchmen of the Jewish priests who beat him and handed him over to the Romans. e Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, could find no guilt in Jesus but the Jewish priests kept insisting he was guilty. Unable to make up his mind, the governor decided to ask the crowd what they wanted, either the release of Jesus or a Jewish rebel. e crowd cried out for the release of the rebel and the crucifixion of Jesus. So Pilate reluc - tantly had him executed. Could the trial really have proceeded like this? Let us have a look. We are told that when Jesus rode into Jerusalem crowds of delighted people greeted him, laying their cloaks on the road and praising him as their king (Mk :). But only a day later a huge crowd were screaming out for him to be cruci - fied (Mk :-). is sudden change from adulation to hatred is hard to explain. Next we have Jesus brought before Pontius Pilate. e Bible portrays Pilate as a man who can find no guilt in Jesus but who is pushed into crucifying him by the Jewish priests. is is clearly impossible. e Romans were famous for their strong and effective government, their judicial system was"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"    known for its justice and they did not send weak, indecisive men to govern troublesome parts of the empire. Who could believe that a Roman governor would allow the people he ruled to make up his mind for him and tell him how to run his own court? e Bible says that Pilate asked the crowd whether they wanted either Jesus or Barabbas released (Lk :-), and when they said Barabbas, he was set free and Jesus was executed. Now credibility has been stretched to the limit. We are asked to believe that a Roman governor would execute a man he believed to be innocent and set free a rebel involved in murder and try - ing to overthrow Roman rule (Lk :). e Romans did not conquer and govern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East by releasing dangerous rebels. ey were completely ruthless with all who opposed them. So the Christian account of Jesus’ trial is unconvincing. If we read what Jesus is supposed to have said at his trial we can see that all the accounts of it are fabrications. According to the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus “gave no answer”, (Matt :) and “made no reply, not even to a single charge, to the great amazement of the governor” (Matt :) during his trial. In a complete contradiction to this the Gospel of John claims that Jesus answered charges, asked questions and spoke much during his trial (Jn :-). Which of these two accounts is true? Was Jesus silent or did he speak? Like the Gospel of John, the Gospel of Luke also claims that Jesus spoke during his trial. But if we compare his account of what was said with Luke’s account we find that almost every sentence is different (Compare Jn :- with Lk :-).

Judas was the disciple who betrayed Jesus. After he had done this he is said to have died. But how did he die? Here, as with many other incidents, the Bible gives us several confused accounts.

Elsewhere we are told a different story. With the reward he got for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out. Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their lan - guage Akeldama, that is, field of blood (Acts :-). Was it Judas who bought the field or was it the chief priests?

To prove the truth of their beliefs fundamentalist Christians will rush to their Bibles and point sometimes to a single sentence saying as proof. ey assume that every phrase, every sentence, every word in the Bible is exactly what Jesus said. We have already seen that the Bible is quite confused about what Jesus did and said. In fact even Jesus’ last words have not been accurately recorded. According to Matthew, Jesus’ last words were: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Matt :). According to Mark he just gave a loud cry and died (Mk :). According to Luke he said, “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit” (Lk :). According to John, Jesus’ last words were: “It is finished.” (Jn :). Once again we have discrepancies and contradictions which make it impossible to know what Jesus actually said. e esurreion e most important event in Jesus’ life and the cornerstone of Christian faith is the supposed resurrection of Jesus. Paul very correctly said “If Christ has not been raised our preaching is empty and our belief comes to nothing” (I Cor, ,) With unusual frankness he also admitted that the idea that Jesus’ re- surrection can somehow save sinners makes no sense ( Cor, ,) and that one would have to be a fool to believe it ( Cor, ,). e informed Buddhist would agree with Paul on this matter.

Buddhists are too polite to laugh at the idea of resurrection but they can find no good reason why they should believe it. Let us examine what the Bible says about the resurrec - tion. At this point the reader is advised to have a Bible ready and to check the references () Jesus’ Death Matthew says that as Jesus died the curtain in the Temple was tore from top to bottom and other strange things happened. But most extraordinary of all he claims that numerous people who had recently died came out of their tombs and walked around in Jerusalem (Matt, ,). If this is true it must have been one of the most amazing days in history. People must have been talking about it for years. News of it must have spread far and wide and at least some of those who came back to life must have written something about their astonishing experience. It is very strange therefore that this event is not mentioned in any of the historical documents of the time including even the other Gospels. () When did the Resurrection happen ? All four Gospels agree that the events described took place early on Sunday morning (Matt :, Mk :, Lk :, Jn :). () Who went to the tomb ? Now the problems begin. Matthew says that the two Marys went to the tomb (Matt :); Mark says that the two Marys and Salome went (Mk :); Luke says that the two Marys, Joanna and some other women went (Lk :); and John says that Mary went alone (Jn :). Christians claim that the Bible contains no mistakes but surely there are a few mistakes here. ey claim that"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"    those who wrote the Gospels were inspired by God as they wrote, but apparently not inspired enough to be able to count properly. () Was there an earthquake ? Matthew tells us that at that time there was a “great earthquake” (Matt :), but why do the other three Gospels fail to mention it? Surely a great earthquake, especially occurring at such a sig - nificant moment, would be hard to forget. It is far more likely that Matthew just made up the story to add drama to his account, in other words he lied. () How many angels ? Next, Matthew claims that an angel appeared before the women, rolled back the stone door and sat upon it (Matt :). He also says that the guards were so frightened that they fainted (Matt :). Mark’s story is quite different. He claims that the door had already been removed before the women arrived so they went into the tomb and saw the angel inside (Mk :-). And he doesn’t mention any guards. Luke’s story is even more inventive. He claims that the women went into the tomb and saw not one but two angels (Lk :). Obviously someone is not telling the truth. John claims that Mary went to the tomb alone, saw the tomb open, ran to get the other disciples and when they went into the tomb she waited outside. After everyone went home Mary waited and as she did two angels appeared to her and then Jesus appeared although she could not recognize him (Jn :-). And it is on this garbled ‘evidence’ that Christianity rests upon. () Post-Resurrection Appearances ere are several accounts of Jesus appearing to his disciples and"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"    others after his supposed resurrection but all of these raise more questions than they answer. For example, Paul says that Jesus appeared to a crowd of five hundred people, many of whom he claimed were still alive ( Cor, ,). One would think that having five hundred eyewitnesses to an event would be conclusive proof that it actually happened. So it is strange that Paul neglects to give the name of even one of these witnesses. It is equally strange that none of them ever wrote about what they saw. Stranger still is the fact that this appearance is not mentioned in the other three Gospels. It is well known that people tend to elaborate their stories the more often they repeat them and even more so if they are trying to impress or convince others. It is also well known that those who lie can’t always remember the lies they have told and end up contradicting themselves. e accounts of Paul’s experience of the resurrected Jesus are a good example of these tendencies. First it is claimed that Paul was blinded by a flash of light and then heard a voice. His companions remained standing and heard the voice although they couldn’t see the light (Acts, ,-). Later, when Paul repeats this tale, he reverses it saying that his companions fell to the ground (Acts, ,) and saw the light although they couldn’t hear the voice (Acts, ,), Further, each time Paul recounts what Jesus is supposed to have said to him it gets a bit longer and more detailed (compare Acts, , with Acts, ,-). Such are the doubtful testimonies that form the foundations of Christianity () What Did Happen ? If Jesus didn’t rise from the dead what did happen to him?

We know that"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"    there had been a lot of trouble in Jerusalem, some of it caused by Jesus himself, and the authorities must have been anxious to keep the peace. It is quite possible that either the Jewish priests or the Romans removed Jesus’ body from the tomb so that it could not become the focus of more trouble. ere is no more evidence for this scenario than there is for the Christian explanation but it is a thousand times more probable and believable. If someone came to you saying that they saw a dead man come to life, rise up into the sky and disappear into the clouds, you would probably be very skeptical because such things go so much against ordinary experience. If you asked if anyone else had seen this happen and they said  people had witnessed it and you asked for the names of some of them but they were unable to provide the name of even one, you would probably become quite suspicious. If you then asked when all this was supposed to have happened and they said more than  years ago, you would dismiss the whole thing as a delusion, a rumor or a tall story. (According to New Testament scholars the earliest account of Jesus life, the Gospel of Mark, was written about  years after Jesus died.) as esus od ? Christians claim that Jesus was God. Let us see if there is any justification for this strange claim. If Jesus really was God it is very strange that he never said so. ere is not one place in the whole of the Bible where Jesus simply and unambiguously says, “I am God”. Christians will object to this and say that Jesus often called himself or was called the Son of God. However, the Bible clearly shows that any good person who had strong faith quali -"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"    fied to be called a Son of God. For example, Jesus called Adam a son of God (Lk :). It will happen that in the very place where it was said of them “you are not my people” they will be called “sons of the living God” (Rom :). Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your father in heaven (Matt :-). You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus (Gal :). You are God’s; you are all sons of the most high (Ps :). Jesus is called God’s “only begotten son” but even this is not unique. In the Psalms God says to King David, “You are my son, today I have begotten you” (Ps :) Further, Jesus distinctly said that when he called himself a son of God he did not mean he was God or related to God in a literal sense. When the Jewish priests criticized him for claiming to be equal with God, Jesus said: Is it not written in your law, “I have said you are gods”? If he called them “gods” to whom the word of God came — and the Scripture cannot be broken — what about one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? (Jn :-). Christians will protest that in these quotes ‘son of god’ is not written in capitals but when Jesus makes his claims capitals are used thus, ‘Son of God’. But capital letters to make a phrase"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"    outstanding or to give it emphasis is an innovation of modern English. In ancient Greek and Aramaic, the languages in which the New Testament was written, capital letters were never used and so the distinction between ‘son of god’ and ‘Son of God’ did not exist. Christians make an enormous fuss about Jesus’ claims to be a son of God but as we can see, there is absolutely nothing unique in this claim. Christians could say that the term Son of God is used in the Bible in two different ways — as a title for a particularly holy person and for the actual son of God, Jesus, who was with God in heaven before coming to earth. But even in this second sense Jesus was not unique. e Bible tells us that God had numerous sons with him in heaven who later came to earth and lived with humans just as Jesus is supposed to have done. When mankind began to increase and spread all over the earth and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; so they took for themselves such women as they chose (Gen :-) In the Bible Jesus is called the Son of Man more than  times. Yet the Bible also tells us that in the eyes of God the Son of Man is nothing more than a worm (Job :). How can Christians claim that the Son of Man is God when the Bible itself says that the Son of Man is nothing more than a lowly worm? Christians will then insist that Jesus was called the Messiah and that this proves he was God. e Hebrew word mashiah of which the Greek translation is christos simply means ‘anointed one’, and refers to anyone sent by God to help the people of Israel. Even a non-Jew could be and sometimes was called a Messiah."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"    e Bible even calls the pagan Persian King Cyrus a Messiah because he let the Jews return to their homeland (Is :). So just because Jesus was called the Messiah does not prove he was God. In fact, throughout the Bible Jesus goes out of his way to make it clear that he was not God. When someone called Jesus ‘good teacher’ he said: Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone (Lk :). Now if Jesus was God why would he deny that he was good? We are told that Jesus prayed but if he was God why would he need to pray to himself? And when Jesus prayed, he said to God, “not my will but yours” (Lk :). Quite clearly he was making a distinction between God’s will and his own. Jesus said that no one has even seen God (Jn :), meaning that when people saw him they were not seeing God. Again Jesus said that he can do nothing without God. I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can only do what he sees the Father do (Jn :). By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me (Jn :). I can do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me (Jn :). If Jesus was God he could do anything he wanted to do and in these passages and dozens of others he is making it as clear as crystal that he is one thing and God another. Jesus said, “e"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"    Father is greater than I” (Jn 14:28) emphasizing again that he was not as great as God and therefore different from him. He says: Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven (Lk :). Now if Jesus and the Holy Spirit were the same, to blaspheme one would be the same as blaspheming the other. In the Bible we are told that no one born of a woman can be pure (Job :). Jesus was born of a woman, his mother Mary, so he likewise must have been impure and if he was impure how could he be God? We are told that Jesus was dead for three days before ascending into heaven. How can God possibly die? Who was looking after the universe while he was dead? Jesus said that at the end of the world he would be sitting at the right hand of God to judge the world (Lk :). If Jesus and God are the same, how would it be possible for them to sit besides each other? To do this they would have to be separate and different. And anyway, David is described as sitting on the right hand of God so to do this one does not have to be anything other than a good human being (Ps :). We are told that Jesus stands between God and man. For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Jesus Christ ( Tim :). is passage clearly states that Jesus is not God for if he was, how could he stand between God and men? It also specifically calls Jesus a man (see also Acts :-).

If God was really Jesus’ father, why does the Bible list all Jesus’ ancestors on his father’s side? Christians are forever claiming that Jesus is God and at the same time that he is the son of God. But how is this possible? How can a father be his own son and himself all at the same time? And to make matters more confused, the Holy Spirit is brought in and we are asked to believe that Jesus, God and the Holy Spirit are all different and yet all the same. e Jewish and Islamic concepts of God are much more logical than this in that they say that God is unambiguously unitary and one. e claim of Christians that Jesus is God contradicts what the Bible says, it goes against common sense and it raises numerous logical problems. Whereas if we see Jesus as he was, an outstand - ing teacher, reformer and prophet, none of these problems arise. ow did esus become od ? It seems inconceivable today that a mere human being could be regarded as a god but the situation was very different in the past. During the time of Jesus Israel was a land in political and social turmoil. Most people were ignorant and superstitious and wild rumors were readily listened to and believed. ere were numerous people passing themselves of as prophets, messiahs, wonder workers and saviors of the Jewish nation. Some of these, like Simon Magus, were apparently able to perform miracles nearly the same as those done by Jesus (Acts, ,,ff). Others like eudas and Judas the Galilean attracted large followings, again just as Jesus did (Acts, ,; Acts, ,). One of these characters even had a name almost identical to Jesus (Acts, ,). When Paul and his companions healed a man in Lystra a huge"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"    crowd gathered and began worshiping them as gods. Paul was horrified and tried to explain that he and his friends were only humans but “even these words could hardly keep the crowd from offering sacrifices to them” (Acts, ,). Most Roman emperors were considered divine after they died and temples were built to worship them in. Clearly this was a time when any charismatic person could attract a huge following and even be proclaimed a god. It happened to others and it happened to Jesus too. as esus erfe ? If a religious teacher were perfect we would expect the behavior of such a person to be unfailingly blameless, their teachings to be humane and practical and there to be consistency between what they preached and how they behaved. Jesus of course, denied that he was perfect (Lk :) but despite this and all the evidence in the Bible, Christians continue to claim that Jesus was perfect. ey have to do this because they mistakenly believe that he was God and how can one have an imperfect god? Buddhists believe that Jesus was a good man as were the founders of the other great world religions but because he was not enlightened like the Buddha he was certainly not perfect. Like other unenlightened people he sometimes did wrong, some of the things he taught were impractical and sometimes he failed to practice what he preached. Let us examine the evidence. Jesus’ ethical teachings are often described as sublime, lofty, utterly perfect, etc. But were they? Let us look at his teachings on divorce. In the Old Testament divorce was allowed under certain circumstances, which of course is the most humane thing to do when a couple no longer love each other. But Jesus took an"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"    extreme position on divorce saying that it was allowable only on the grounds of adultery: It has been said, “Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce”. But I tell you that any - one who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaith - fulness, causes her to commit adultery, and anyone who marries a woman so divorced also commits adultery (Matt 5:31-32). is terrible teaching has meant that in Christian countries until recently millions of couples were trapped in unhappy loveless marriages because they were unable to get a divorce. It also meant that countless women who did manage to get a divorce from their husbands even without committing adultery were branded as adulterers if they married again. is teach - ing of Jesus alone has caused untold misery and heartbreak. Another example of Jesus’ far from perfect teachings is his attitude to money. He seems to have had a deep resentment for the rich: But woe to you that are rich, for you have received your consolation. Woe to you that are full now, for you shall hunger (Lk :-). While it is true that the rich are sometimes greedy and thought - less (as are the poor) no mention is made of this. e rich are condemned simply because they are rich. Once when a young man pressed Jesus for an answer to the question of how he could have eternal life he finally said: If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"    give it to the poor and follow me and you will have treasure in heaven (Matt :). He even went so far as to say that it is virtually impossible for a rich person to go to heaven. Truly, I say to you, it will be hard for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Again, I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a nee - dle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God (Matt :-). Christians of course have never taken any notice of these sayings of Jesus but if they did the economies of most Christian countries would collapse and all the good qualities that honest entrepre - neurship can engender would disappear. ese rather impractical and unfair ideas contrasts very sharply with the Buddha’s atti - tude to wealth. He recognized that wealth honestly earned can be a source of goodness and happiness. What is the happiness of ownership? Herein, a house - holder has wealth acquired by energetic striving, won by strength of arm and sweat of brow, justly and law - fully won When he thinks of this, he feels happiness and satisfaction.

With wealth acquired by energetic striving, won by strength of arm and sweat of brow lawfully and justly, a noble disciple makes himself, his mother and father, his wife and children, his servants and workmen and his friends and acquaintances cheerful and happy — he creates perfect happiness. is is the first opportunity seized by him, used for good and appropriately made use of (Anguttara Nikaya, Book of Fives, Sutta No.). So rather than dismissing the rich wholesale from the religious life as Jesus did the Buddha taught them to earn their money honestly and to use it for the benefit of themselves and the gen - eral community. One aspect of Jesus teachings that many thoughtful people find disturbing is his depreciation of critical and independent think - ing. He praised more highly those who believed without seeing than those who asked for evidence (Jh,,). Once he said that unless a person becomes like a little child they cannot enter the kingdom of heaven (Matt, , ) Small children are of course naïve, trusting and often believe anything they are told.

When the Kalamas said that they didn’t know how to choose between the various contending faiths he said to them; Do not go by revelation, tradition, rumor, or the sacred scriptures.... But when you yourself know that a thing is good, useful and praised by the wise then accept and practice it (Anguttara Nikaya,;) Another problem with Jesus’ as an ethical teacher is the numer - ous important moral issues he failed to give any guidance about. Slavery for example was a inhumane and widespread institution during his time and yet he is completely silent about it. He says nothing about racial discrimination, domestic violence, war or the problems of alcohol and drugs. Other crucial issues like how societies should be governed, the administration of justice, economics or medical ethics are not addressed either. On the other hand there are numerous ideas that Jesus did teach which even the most enthusiastic fundamentalist Christians would be reluctant to practice or even to agree with. He said that we should not resist those who do evil although most people today would say that not countering evil is the height of irresponsibil - ity (Matt,,). He taught that just to look at a woman with lust amounted to committing adultery which pretty much makes every male on earth an adulterer (Mat,,). He said that if we call someone a fool in a moment of anger that we will be con -"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"    demned to eternal hell so presumably most of us are destined for the fiery furnace (Mat,,). He said that poor people will always be with us which is hardly an incentive to try to eradicate poverty and depravation (Matt,,). He even said that if we do wrong with our hand or tongue that you should cut them off which seems extreme by any standards (Matt, ; ). It should be noted here that some early Christians actually did take these words of Jesus seriously and cut off their genitals when they couldn’t control their sexual desire. But the teaching of Jesus which has caused more problems than any other is his claim that he and he alone can give salva - tion (Jn :). It follows axiomatically from this that all other religions lead to the only alternative to salvation — hell — and are therefore evil. Sadly, this claim by Jesus is the root of that very characteristic Christian trait — intolerance. Christianity has always equated disbelief in Jesus with evil and has castigated non- believers as godless, wicked, stubborn, pagan, scoffers, followers of false prophets and idol worshippers (see e.g. I Pet, :-). Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? ( Cor :-). In this passage Paul asks what a Christian can possibly have in common with, for example, a Buddhist? For Paul as for funda - mentalist and evangelical Christians the fact that the Buddhist"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"    may value and practice love, compassion, charity, patience, humil - ity and truthfulness just as he himself does, counts for nothing. For the fundamentalist and evangelical Christian the single fact that the Buddhist does not believe in Jesus automatically puts him on the side of wickedness and darkness; he is an idol wor - shipper who should be shunned and who deserves to go to hell. is is the great tragedy of Christianity — the stronger the Christian’s faith, the more partisan, bigoted and intolerant he usually becomes. What a relief it is to be able to Take Refuge in the Buddha and still be able to respect Lao Tzu, the Prophet Mohammed, Krishna, Guru Nanak and other great religious teachers. How pleasant it is to be able to communicate with oth - ers without the need to be always trying to convert them. How nice it is to be able to be happy when one sees others happy with their religion. Fundamentalist Christianity is intolerant because it is obsessed with Jesus and excludes everyone who does not accept him. Buddhism is tolerant because it treasures wisdom and compassion wherever they are found and it can embrace anyone who upholds these virtues. ell Jesus taught at least two different ideas about what happens after death. According to the first when someone dies they will be judged and then assigned to either heaven or hell (Lk, , -). According to the second when people die they will remain in their graves until Jesus returns and only then come before him to be judged (Matt, , -). However, Jesus was quite clear that hell is the only alternative to heaven that all those who do not believe in him and many others too will go to hell and that"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"    hell is a place of eternal punishment. Without any doubt this is the most unattractive of all Jesus teachings. Behind all his gentleness and his exhortations to love and to forgive lurks the terrible threat of eternal damnation. Most liberal Christians are very uncomfortable with these ideas and try to make them sound a little better by rationalizing them. Firstly they will try to free Jesus or God from respon - sibility by saying that they do not send us to hell but that we send ourselves there by our evil actions. is flatly contradicts the Bible, which repeatedly says that the dead are judged before being assigned to hell. is judgment is not an automatic process but the result of a conscious decision on the part of Jesus, God or angels acting on their behalf. Further, the Bible makes it clear that it is not primarily our actions that determine whether we go to heaven or hell but our beliefs. A good Buddhist is destined for hell while a Christian who has been bad but later repents will go to heaven. e next way Christians try to explain away hell is by saying that it is not really a place of torture and punishment but of purification or separation from God. Again this directly contradicts the Bible. Jesus describes hell as an “eternal fire that has been prepared by the Devil and his angels!” (Matt, , ) and as a place of “wail - ing and gnashing of teeth” where the dammed cry out for pity and for water to quench their burning thirst (Lk, , ). Jesus says that God’s ability to cast us into eternal hell should make us utterly terrified of him. “I tell you my friends, do not fear those who put to death the body and then can do no more. I will tell you who to fear. Fear He who after killing you is able"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"    to throw you into hell. is is who you should fear” (Lk, , -). Another strategy is to say that all these ideas are not meant to be taken literally. But why not? If we take the idea of resurrec - tion, salvation or the incarnation on face value why shouldn’t we do the same with the idea of eternal hell? Why are Christians so ready to endorse some of Jesus’ ideas but so reluctant to even acknowledge others? Of course the reason for this is very clear. To the modern mind the concept of eternal hell for all non-Christians seems vindictive, vengeful, cruel and unjust. Liberal Christians are embarrassed to admit that Jesus could have conceived of such ideas. Evangelical and fundamentalist Christians are far less squeamish about hell than their liberal brethren. ey are only too happy to proclaim the reality of eternal damnation and are quick to tell you that this will be your fate too if you do not believe in Jesus. In this sense they are less pleasant than liberal Christians but at least more true to what Jesus taught. iracles One of the most bizarre things about Jesus were the miracles he is said to have performed. e most famous of these was bring - ing Lazarus back from the dead. Lazarus had been dead for at least four days and was presumably in heaven, while his family were heartbroken and grieving. In raising him from the dead, Jesus certainly demonstrated his power but what did Lazarus and his family get out of it? Lazarus was removed from heaven and brought back to “this vale of tears” only to have to die all over"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"    again some time in the future, while his family would have to go through grieving and distress all over again (Jn :-). To the Buddhist this miracle, if it even really happened, seems to be unnecessary and even cruel. How much more prac - tical and humane was the Buddha’s approach to death. On one occasion a young mother named Kisagotami came to the Buddha with her dead son, deranged with grief and pleading with the Buddha to give her son some medicine. Full of compassion the Buddha told her to go and get a mustard seed from a house where no one had ever died. In the process of looking for such a seed, Kisagotami gradually came to realize that death is an integral part of life and she overcame her grief (Dhammapada Atthakatta, Book ,). Jesus performed showy miracles which seemed to leave people much as they were. e Buddha gently and skillfully helped people to understand and accept the real - ity of death. is is what the Buddha meant when he said that education is the highest miracle (Digha Nikaya, Sutta No.). Another miracle where Jesus seems to have given little thought to the consequences of what he was doing was the one he supposedly performed at Godara. A man was possessed by devils and just before Jesus exorcised them these devils asked him to send them into a nearby herd of pigs. Jesus obliged, sending the devils into the pigs, which then rushed screaming down the side of a cliff and into a lake where they all drowned (Mk :-). e possessed man must have been very grateful for this but one wonders what the owners of the pigs would have thought. e loss of their animals would have caused them great financial hardship. Not surprisingly, we are told that after this incident the people from the nearby village came to Jesus and begged him to leave their territory (Mk :). Note that Matthew tells this"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"    same story but he exaggerates it, claiming that not one but two men were exorcised (Matt :-). is supposed miracle also highlights Jesus utter disregard for nature. He could simply have expelled the devils but instead he chose to do it in a most cruel way by driving to their deaths a large number of completely harmless and innocent animals. On another occasion he used his miraculous powers to kill a fig tree simply because it could not bear fruit (Matt :-). Apparently he never considered that animals could have eaten its leaves, birds could have nested in its branches, travelers could have rested in its shade and its roots would have helped prevent erosion of the soil by the rain and wind — which probably explains why the tree had been left growing. No advantage at all came from killing the tree — it was little more than an act of wanton vandalism. While some of Jesus’ miracles were pointless others seem to have verged on the ridiculous. We are told that once Jesus was invited to a wedding. After some time there was no wine left to drink so he turned several large jars of water into wine (Jn :-). No doubt the host must have appreciated not having to go out to buy more alcohol, but it does seem a bit incongruous that God should incarnate as a human, come to earth and use his powers just so that people wouldn’t run out of drinks at their parties. nconsistency What we have said above indicates that while some of Jesus’ teachings were good, others were cruel, impractical, and in some cases just silly. And perhaps it is not surprising that not only have Christians often failed to practice Jesus’ teachings, but he often also failed to practice them himself. He taught that we should"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"    love our neighbor but he seems to have problems doing this him - self. He believed that his teaching could lead people to heaven and yet he specifically instructed his disciples not to preach the Gospel to anyone but his own people, the Jews. Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel (Matt :-). When a poor distressed woman came to Jesus begging for help he refused to help her simply because she was not Jewish. Teaching the Gospel to Canaanites was, he said, like taking food from children and throwing it to dogs. A Canaanite woman from the vicinity came to him, crying out, “Lord, son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is suffering terribly from demon-pos - session”. Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us”. He answered: “I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel”. e woman came and knelt before him, “Lord, help me!” she said. He replied, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs” (Matt :-) It was only after strong urging from his disciples that he finally decided to help the woman. So much for loving one’s neigh - bor. Jesus taught that we should love our enemies, but again he seemed to have difficulties doing this. When the Pharisees criticized him he responded with a tirade of curses and insults (e.g. Jn 8:42-47, Matt 23:13-36). Jesus said that we should not"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"    judge others (Matt 7:12) and claimed that he himself judged no one (Jn 8:15). But despite this he was constantly judging and con - demning others, often in a harsh and sweeping manner (Jn 8:42-47, Matt 23:13-16) In conformity with the Old Testament Jesus taught that we must honor our mother and father (Matt 19:19) but on other occasions he taught and practised the exact opposite. If any one comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, even his own life, he cannot be my dis - ciple (Lk :). is demand that to love Jesus we must be prepared to hate oth - ers, even our own parents, seems to be very much at odds with the idea of honoring parents — let alone with the idea of loving our neighbor. Once Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him while he was preaching only to be rudely rebuffed. And his mother and brothers came, and standing out - side they sent to him and called him. And a crowd was sitting about him, and they said to him, “Your mother and brothers are outside, asking for you”. And he replied, “Who are my mother and my brothers?” And looking around on those who sat about him, he said, “Here are my mother and brothers!” (Mk :-). Once when his mother spoke to him, Jesus snapped at her: “O woman, what have you to do with me?” (Jn :).

And indeed Jesus seems to have acted like this sometimes. But at other times he clearly saw his role as a violent one. Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace on the earth. I did not come to bring peace but the sword. I have come to turn a man against his father, a daugh - ter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law, a man’s enemies will be the members of his own household (Matt :-). Certainly he saw nothing wrong with using violence when he thought it was necessary. When he saw the money changers in the temple he lost his temper and lashed out with violence. So he made a whip out of cords and drove all from the temple areas: he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables (Jn :). Before his arrest Jesus was expecting trouble so he told his dis - ciples to prepare themselves by getting weapons. If you do not have a sword sell your cloak and buy one (Lk :).

So how do informed Buddhists see Jesus? Firstly they think of him as a great moral teacher on a par with Confucius, Mahavira, Kabir, Lao Tzu, Krishna or Guru Nanak. His teachings that evokes most admiration in Buddhists is his stress on humility, love and service to others. ese ideas are very similar to what the Buddha taught some  years earlier and strike a cord with all Buddhists. Jesus said that the great - est love is to give ones life for ones’ friend (Jn, , ) and the Buddha taught exactly the same thing (D, III, ). When Jesus said, “Do unto others what you would like done unto you”, we are reminded of the Buddha’s exhortation “ink like this, ‘As am I so are others. As are others so am I’, and harm none nor have them harmed”.

But some other claims made about him fit into Buddhist doctrines very well. According to Buddhism all good people can be reborn in the heaven realm. Jesus was clearly a good person, a very good person, and so Buddhists agree when the Bible says he went to heaven after his death. Buddhist also agrees with the Bible when it says that Jesus will come again.

Unlike fundamentalist evangelicals, historians have given perfectly plausible answers to these questions. e Bible is not a revelation from God, it is a compilation, a rather untidy com - pilation, written by many different people, over many centuries, changed and edited from time to time and containing legends, stories, genealogies, fables, sacred and secular writings.

Christians are always claiming that God speaks to them in prayer, that he gives them advice and tells them what to do. ey claim that God’s voice is very direct, very clear and very real. But if they really have no doubt that God is communicating with them then surely his words should be recorded and included in the Bible. e Bible contains words God spoke to Moses, Joshua, Matthew, Mark, Peter and Paul so why shouldn’t the words he speaks to modern day Christians be included also?

Today, even schoolchildren know that the earth moves; it moves on its axis and at the same time it moves around the sun. We know that the tectonic plates on the earth’s surface move also. e Bible however, clearly states that the earth does not move. In  Chronicles : the Bible says, “e world is firmly established, it cannot be moved.” (See also Ps :, : and :). Here, and in many places, the Bible contradicts scientific fact. But the Bible does not just contradict science it also con - tradicts itself . Let us have a look at the creation story. In the first book of the Bible it says that God created all the plants and trees on the third day (Gen :-), all birds, animals and fish on the fifth day (Gen :-) and finally, man and woman on the sixth day (Gen :-). Yet a little further on the Bible gives a different version of the creation story saying that God created man first (Gen :), then all plants and trees (Gen :), after that all birds and animals (Gen :) and only then did God create woman (Gen :-). ese two versions of the creation story clearly contradict each other. Now let us have a look at the story of Noah’s Ark. In one place in the Bible we are told that Noah took two of every animal and put them in the ark (Gen ; ). But later the Bible says Noah took seven pairs of all clean animals and birds and two of all other creatures and put them in the ark (Gen :). Again the Bible is contradicting itself. Fundamentalist Christians will object to all this saying that these and the numer - ous other mistakes in the Bible are only small and of no signifi - cance. However, only one mistake is required to show that the Bible is not infallible. Further, if mistakes can be made in small matters they can be made in important matters.

We have seen that the Bible is not infallible and therefore can - not be a revelation. So if it is not God’s word whose word is it? Many of the books in the Bible are named after the people who are supposed to have written them. So the Gospel of Matthew is supposed to have been written by Matthew, one of the disciples of Jesus. e Gospel of Mark is supposed to have been written by Mark, another of Jesus’ disciples and so on. Christians could claim that even if the Bible is not neces - sarily an infallible revelation it is the testimony of reliable people, ey could claim that Matthew, Mark, Luke and John knew Jesus well, they lived with him for several years, they heard his teachings and they wrote down what they saw and heard and that there is no reason for them to lie or exaggerate. erefore, Christians could claim that the Bible is reliable testimony. However, for testimony to be reliable it must come from reliable people, people we could trust, people from good backgrounds. Were the disciples of Jesus such people? Let us look. Some of Jesus’ disciples were tax collectors (Matt :), a dishonest and despised class with a well earned reputation for corruption (Matt ; ); oth - ers were mere illiterate fishermen (Mk :-). Simon was a Zealot (Lk :), a group of men known for their fanatical and often violent opposition to Roman rule and like many people involved in illegal politics he used an alias and was also known as Peter (Matt :). Peter and James were given the nicknames ‘Boanerges’ meaning ‘sons of thunder’ (Mk :) once again suggesting their involvement in violent politics.

Further, they are supposed to have seen Jesus perform the most amazing miracles and yet despite this they still doubted. If even the people who knew and saw Jesus didn’t believe how we could who have never seen him be expected to have faith in him? Jesus scolded his disciples and called them “men of little faith” (Matt :, :). Should we trust the writings of men who constantly failed to understand what was being said to them and whom even Jesus called men of little faith? How unreliable and faithless the people who wrote the Bible were is best illustrated by what they did just prior to and during Jesus’ arrest. He asked them to keep watch but they fell asleep (Matt :-). After Jesus was arrested they lied and denied that they even knew him (Mk :-), and after his execution they simply went back to their fishing (Jn :-). And who betrayed Jesus in the first place? His disciple Judas (Matt :-). Association with sinners, liars, traitors and fools in order to help them, as Jesus did, is a good thing. But should we believe everything such people say? An even more disturbing thing about the people who wrote the Bible is just how many of them were possessed by demons or devils from time to time. Mary Magdalene who later claimed to have seen Jesus rise from the dead, had been possessed by seven devils (Mk :). Satan entered into Judas (Lk :), tried to get into Simon (Lk :) and Jesus once actually called his chief disciple Peter “Satan” (Matt :) suggesting that he too was possessed by a devil at the time.

We will now show that the Bible was not even writ - ten by the people who are supposed to have written it. Let us have a look at the first five books in the Bible; Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. ese five books describe the creation of the world, God’s first revelation to man and the early history of the tribe of Israel and are supposed to have been written by Moses. ey are in fact, often called ‘e Books of Moses’. However, his authorship is clearly impossible because in these books we have an account of Moses’ death.

How could a person write an account of his own death and burial? e book of Deuteronomy at least, must have been writ - ten by someone other than Moses. Now let us have a look at the New Testament. e Gospel of Matthew is supposed to have been written by Matthew (tax collector, doubter, man of little faith), one of the disciples of Jesus.

If Matthew had really written this we would expect it to read: As Jesus passed on from there he saw me sitting at the tax office and he said to me, “Follow me”. And I rose and followed him. Obviously this was not written by Matthew but by some third person. Who this third person I was we do not know but Bible scholars have made a guess. In the preface to his translation of the Gospel of Matthew the distinguished Bible scholar J. B.

Also notice that the notes to Mark :- mention that this long passage is not found in the ancient copies of the Bible. In other words, this long passage was added at a later time and has now been removed. How can born again and fundamentalist Christians honestly claim that their Bible is infallible and without mistakes when all the mistakes are listed at the bottom of each page?

But while the Bible agrees with the Buddha on this matter the two disagree on why suffering exists. Christianity relies on what is plainly a myth to explain the origin of evil and suffering, claiming that they are due to Adam and Eve having eaten an apple. Buddhism sees suffering as a psy - chological phenomenon with a psychological cause — wanting, craving and desire. And our experience tells us that this is so. When we want something and cannot get it we feel frustration and the stronger the wanting the stronger the frustration. Even if we get what we want we soon grow tired of it and begin to want something else. Even physical suffering is caused by crav - ing because the strong craving to live causes us to be reborn and when we are reborn we become subject to sickness, accidents, old age, etc. Buddhism says that even the bliss of heaven is imper - manent and imperfect, a fact again confirmed by the Bible. e Bible tells us that Satan was originally a heavenly angel but that he rebelled against God (i.e. he was dissatisfied) and was cast out of heaven (i.e. existence in heaven need not be eternal).

In Christianity humans are held responsible for the evil they have done throughout their lives but they are also held responsible for and likely to be punished for the sins of Adam and Eve.

It is true that Christianity has an explanation about how every - thing began but is this explanation correct? Let us examine it. e Bible says that God created everything in six days and that on the seventh day he rested. is quaint old story is nothing but a myth and is no more true than the Hindu myth that the gods created everything by churning a sea of milk or the clas - sical belief that the universe hatched out of a cosmic egg. Some parts of the creation myth are plainly absurd. For example, it is said that on the first day God created light and darkness but only on the fourth day did he create the sun (Gen :-). How can there be day and night, light and darkness without the sun? is creation myth also contradicts modern science which has proven how the universe began and how life evolved. ere are no departments of astronomy or biology in any of the world’s universities which teach the creation myth for the simple reason that it is not based on fact. So while it is true that Christianity has an explanation for how everything began it is nothing more than a quaint old legend."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"  en what does Buddhism sat about how everything began ? Buddhism has little to say on this subject and for a very good rea - son. e aim of Buddhism is to develop wisdom and compassion and thereby attain Nirvana. Knowing how the universe began can contribute nothing to this task. Once a man demanded that the Buddha tell him how the universe began. e Buddha said to him: “You are like a man who has been shot with a poison arrow and who, when the doctor comes to remove it, says ‘Wait! Before the arrow is removed I want to know the name of the man who shot it, what clan he comes from, which village he was born in. I want to know what type of wood his bow is made from, what feathers are on the end of the arrow, how long the arrows are, etc., etc.’ at man would die before all these questions could be answered. My job is to help you to remove the arrow of suffering from yourself” (Majjhima Nikaya Sutta No. ). Buddhism concentrates on helping us solve the practical prob - lems of living — it does not encourage useless speculation. And if a Buddhist did want to know how and when the universe began he would ask a scientist. Buddhism is impractical because it says you cannot even kill an ant. Before we defend Buddhism against the charge of being imprac - tical, let us see if Christianity is practical. According to Jesus if"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"  someone slaps us on the cheek we should turn the other cheek and let them slap us there also (Matt ;). If we discover that someone has stolen our pants we should go out and give the thief our shirt as well (Matt :). If we ourselves cannot resist stealing we should cut off our hands (Matt :). We could call all these teachings impractical although Christians would prob - ably prefer to call them challenging. And perhaps they would be right. To turn the other cheek when someone assaults us is not easy. It requires that we control our anger and doing this helps to develop patience, humility, non-retaliation and love. If we are never challenged we will never grow. e Buddha asked us to have respect for all life, even for humble creatures. As with turning the other cheek, this is not always easy. Creatures such as ants can be an irritating inconvenience. When we take the precept not to kill and try to practice it we are challenged to develop patience, humility, love, etc. So in asking us to respect all life, Buddhism is no more impractical than Christianity and it is certainly more compassionate. e Buddha is dead so he cannot help you. Buddhists sometimes have difficulty responding effectively when Christians say this to them. However, if we know Dhamma well it will be quite easy to refute it because like most Christian claims about Buddhism, it is based upon misunderstandings. Firstly, the Buddha is not dead, he has attained Nirvana, a state of utter peace and freedom. e other name the Buddha gives Nirvana is the Deathless State ( amita ) because after one attains it one is no longer subject to birth or death.

However, it is not non-existence as the Buddha makes very clear (Majjhima Nikaya Sutta No.; Sutta Nipata, verse ). It is equally untrue to say that the Buddha cannot help us. During his forty year career the Buddha explained in great detail and with masterly clarity everything we need to attain Nirvana. All we need to do is to follow his instructions. e Buddha’s words are as helpful and as valid today as when he first spoke them. Of course the Buddha doesn’t help us in the same way as Christians claim Jesus helps them and for a very good reason. If a student knew that during the exams he could ask the teacher for the answers to the exam questions he would never study and conse - quently would never learn. If an athlete knew that by merely asking for it the judge would give him the prize, he would never bother to train and develop his body. Simply giving people everything they ask for does not necessarily help them. In fact, it guarantees that they will remain weak, dependent and lazy. e Buddha pointed us to Nirvana and told us what provisions we would need for the journey. As we proceed, we will learn from our experiences and our mistakes, developing strength, maturity and wisdom as we proceed. Consequently when we finish our journey we will be completely different persons from when we started. Because of the Buddha’s skilful help we will be fully enlightened. So when Christians say they that the Buddha can’t help us this is quite wrong. But it also implies two things: that Jesus is alive and that he can and will help us. Let us look at these two assumptions. Christians claim that Jesus is alive but what evidence is there of this? ey will say that the Bible proves that Jesus rose from the dead.

Does this prove that everything which exists is just mud? Of course it does not. A passage in the Old Testament even says that a man named Balaam had a donkey which could talk. Is that conclusive evidence that animals can speak? Of course it is not. We cannot uncritically accept claims made in the Bible any more than we can uncritically accept claims made in other sacred books. When we examine Bible claims about Jesus’ supposed resurrection we find very good reasons why we should not believe them. In fact, the Bible actually proves that Jesus is not alive. Just before he was crucified he told his disciples that he would return before the last of them had died (Matt :, Matt :, Lk :). at was  years ago and Jesus has still not returned. Why? Obviously because he is dead. e second assumption is that Jesus always responds when you pray to him. It is very easy to prove that this is not true. Christians die from sickness, suffer from misfortunes, have emo - tional problems, give in to temptations etc just as non-Christians do and despite the fact that they pray to Jesus for help. I have a friend who had been a devout Christian for many years. Gradually he began to doubt and he asked his pastor for help. e pastor instructed him to pray and even got members of the church to pray for him.

Why didn’t Jesus answer my friend’s prayers and help him to remain a Christian? Obviously because he is dead and unable to help. ere is even evidence in the Bible that he cannot help people. Once Jesus appeared to Paul and promised that he would protect him from both the Jews and the pagans (Acts., ) but we know that Paul was eventually executed by the Romans. Why didn’t Jesus protect Paul? Obviously because he is dead and can’t help. In answer to this objection Christians will say that there are people who can testify that their prayers have been answered. If this is true, it is also true that there are Muslims, Taoists, Sikhs, Hindus, Jews, and even the follows of tribal religions who can say the same thing. Unlike Christianity, Buddhism is so pessimistic. According to Webster’s Dictionary, pessimism is the belief that evil in life outweighs the good. It is interesting that Christians accuse Buddhism of being pessimistic because the idea that evil is more pervasive than good is one of the central doctrines of Christianity. Two of the fundamentalist Christians favorite Bible quotes are “All have sinned, all have fallen short of God’s glory” (Rom :) and “Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins (Ecc :). e doctrine of Original Sin teaches that all human beings are sinners, incapable of free - ing themselves of sin and that the evil in us is stronger than the good (Rom :-). Christians will say that while this is true we can be free from sin if we accept Jesus. is may be so but it is still the case that Christians feel they need Jesus because their view of human nature is so utterly negative and pessimistic. Buddhism on the other hand has a very different not to"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"  say more realistic view of human nature. While fully recogniz - ing mankind’s potential for evil, Buddhism teaches that we can conquer evil and develop good through our own efforts. Abandon evil! One can abandon evil!

If it were impossible to cultivate the good I would not ask you to do so. But as it can be done, therefore I say, “Cultivate the good!” (Anguttara Nikaya, Book of Ones). Whether one agrees with this belief or not, one could certainly not say that it is pessimistic. Jesus teaches us to love but Buddhism encourages us to be cold and detached. is is not true. e Buddha says that we should develop a warm caring love towards all living beings. Just as a mother would protect her only child even at the risk of her own life, even so one should cultivate uncon - ditional love to all beings (Sutta Nipata, verse ) In every sense love is as important in Buddhism as it is in Christianity and is emphasized just as much. ere is however something which somewhat spoils the fundamentalist Christians’ practice of love. eir loud insistence that only they love, that the quality of their love is superior to that of others and their constant disparagement of and scoffing at others’ efforts to practice love, makes them appear thoroughly invidious.

You claim that when we die we are reborn, but there is no proof of this. Before responding to this claim let us examine both the Christian and Buddhist after-life theories. According to Christianity, God creates a new soul that becomes a human being, lives its life and then dies. After death the soul will go to eternal heaven if it believed in Jesus or to eternal hell if it did not. According to Buddhism, it is impossible to fathom the ultimate beginning of existence. Each being lives its life, dies and then is reborn into a new existence. is process of dying and being reborn is a natu - ral one and can go on forever unless the being attains Nirvana. When a being does attain Nirvana in this life their understand - ing and consequently their behavior alters and this changes the process which causes rebirth. So instead of being reborn into a new existence the being attains final Nirvana. Nirvana is not existence (to exist means to respond to stimuli, to grow and decay, to move in time and space, to experience oneself as a separate, etc.) and it is not non-existence in that it is not annihilation. In other words each being’s existence is beginningless and endless unless Nirvana is attained and until that time existence has no other purpose than to exist. ere is little evidence for either of these two theories. However, there are several logical and moral problems with the Christian theory which are absent from the Buddhist theory and which make the latter more acceptable. Christianity sees existence as having a beginning but no end whereas Buddhism sees it as cyclic. Nature offers no examples of processes which"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"  have a beginning but no end. Rather, all the natural processes we observe are cyclic. e seasons go and return again next year. Rain falls, flows to the sea, evaporates, and forms clouds which again fall as rain. e body is made up of the elements we ingest as food; when we die the body breaks down and releases its elements into the soil, where they are absorbed by plants and animals which we again eat to build the body. e planets circle the sun and even the galaxy containing our solar system slowly revolves. e Buddhist theory of rebirth is in harmony with the cyclic processes we see throughout nature whereas the Christian theory is not. Christians claim that God created us for a purpose — so we can believe in him, obey him and be saved. If this is so it is very difficult to explain why each year millions of unborn babies naturally abort and millions of other babies are born dead or die within the first few years of their lives. Further, millions of people are born and live their whole lives with severe mental retardation, unable to think even the most simple thoughts. How do all these people fit into God’s supposed plan? What purpose can God have in creating a new life and then letting it die even before it is born or soon after its birth? And what happens to all these beings? Do they go to eternal heaven or eternal hell? If God really created us with a plan in mind, that plan is certainly not very obvious. Further, as the majority of the world’s people are non-Christian and as not even all Christians will be saved, this means that a good percentage of all the souls that God cre - ates will go to hell. God’s supposed plan to save everyone seems to have gone terribly wrong. So although we can’t prove either the Christian or the Buddhist afterlife theory, the Buddhist doc - trine is more appealing and acceptable."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"  If we are really reborn, how do you explain the increase in the world’s population ? When beings die they are reborn but they are not necessarily reborn as the same type of being. For example, a human could be reborn as a human, as an animal, or perhaps as a heaven being, according to its kamma. e fact that there is a dramatic increase in the world’s human population indicates that more animals are being reborn as humans (there has been a corresponding drop in the number of animals due to extinction etc.) and more humans are being reborn as humans. Why is this so? Just why more animals are being reborn as humans is difficult to say. But why more humans are being reborn as humans is undoubtedly due to an increasingly widespread knowledge of the Buddha’s teachings. Even where the Dhamma is not widely known its capacity to be a subtle influence for good is powerful. All this can account for the increase in the human population. Nirvana is an impractical goal because it takes so long to attain and so few can do it. It is true that attaining Nirvana may take a long time but on the other hand rebirth gives us plenty of time. If one does not do it in this life one can continue striving in the next life. In fact, it will take as long as one wants. e Buddha says that if one really wants, one can attain Nirvana within seven days (Majjhima Nikaya Sutta No.). If this is so, the Christian will ask, why haven’t all Buddhists already attained Nirvana? For the simple reason that mundane phenomena still hold an attraction for them. As insight and understanding gradually make that attraction fade one moves step by step, at one’s own pace, towards Nirvana. As for the claim that only a few people can attain Nirvana, this is"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"  not correct. While in Christianity a person has one and only one chance of being saved, Buddhism’s teachings on rebirth mean that a person will have an infinite number of opportunities to attain Nirvana. is also implies that everyone will eventually be liberated. As the Buddhist text says: is immortal state has been attained by many and can be still attained even today by anyone who makes an effort. But not by those who do not strive (erigatha, verse ). In Christianity, history has a meaning and is moving towards a particular goal. Buddhism’s cyclic view of existence means that history has no meaning and this makes Buddhists fatalistic and indifferent. It is true that according to Buddhism history is not moving towards any climax. But the person who is walking the Noble Eightfold Path certainly is. He or she is resolutely moving towards the peace and freedom of Nirvana. Just as the river Ganges flows, slides, tends towards the east, so too one who cultivates and makes much of the Noble Eightfold Path flows, slides, tends towards Nirvana (Samyutta Nikaya, Great Chapter, Sutta No. ) So it is not true to say that Buddhism’s more realistic view of existence and history necessarily leads to indifference. And what climax is history moving towards according to Christianity? e Apocalypse, where the vast majority of humanity and all the works of humankind will be consumed by brimstone and fire.

It would be difficult to imagine a more depressing future to look forward to than this. e Buddha copied the idea of kamma and rebirth from Hinduism. Hinduism does teach a doctrine of kamma and also reincarna - tion. However, their versions of both these teachings are very different from the Buddhist versions. For example, Hinduism says we are determined by our kamma while Buddhism says kamma only conditions us. According to Hinduism, an eternal soul ( atman ) passes from one life to the next while Buddhism denies that there is such a soul ( anatman ) saying rather that it is a constantly changing stream of mental energy that is reborn. ese are just two of many differences between Hinduism and Buddhism on kamma and rebirth. However, even if the Buddhist and Hindu teachings were identical this would not necessarily mean that the Buddha unthinkingly copied the ideas of others. It sometimes happens that two people, quite independently of each other, make exactly the same discovery. A good example of this is the discovery of evolution. In , just before he published his famous book e Origin of the Species , Charles Darwin found that another man, Alfred Russell Wallace, had conceived the idea of evolution exactly as he had done. Darwin and Wallace had not copied each other’s ideas; rather, by studying the same phenomena they had come to the same conclusion about them quite independently of each other.

Jesus forgives our sins, but Buddhism says you can never escape the consequences of your kamma. It is only partially true that Jesus forgives sins. According to Christianity, after people are created they will live forever — first for a few decades on earth and then for eternity in either heaven or hell. Jesus will forgive people’s sins while they live in the world but for the rest of eternity he will refuse to do so, no matter how frequently or how pitifully the souls in hell may call upon his name. So Jesus’ forgiveness is very conditional, it is limited to a minute period of time in a person’s existence after which he will withhold it. So most people will never escape from the conse - quences of their supposed sin. Can Buddhists escape from their kamma? e doctrine of kamma teaches that every action ( kamma ) has an effect ( vipaka ). However, this effect is not always equal to its cause. For example, if a person steals something this act will have a negative effect. If however after the theft the person feels remorse, returns the stolen article and sincerely resolves to try to be more careful in the future, the negative effect of the theft may be mitigated. ere would still be an effect although not as strong. But even if the thief does not mitigate the wrong which he has done with some good, he will be free from the deed after its effect comes to fruition.

In Buddhism while one may have to endure the negative effects of the evil one has done (which is only fair) this means that one will experience the positive effects of the good one has done as well. is is not so in Christianity. A non-Christian may be honest, merciful, generous and kind yet despite this at death this person will go to hell and not receive any reward for the good he has done. Further, according to the doctrine of kamma, the effects we experience, all things being equal, are in direct proportion to their cause. is is not so in Christianity — even if a person is exceptionally evil during this life, eternal hell is an utterly disproportionate punishment. How much more this so if is the person is good but not Christian? Indeed the eternity of hell and the idea that all non-Christians are condemned to it, are teachings that cast very serious doubts on the concept of a just and loving God. Christianity has spread to almost every country in the world and has more followers than any other religion, so it must be true. It is true that Christianity has spread widely but how has this happened? Until the th century Christianity was largely con - fined to Europe. After this, European armies spread throughout the world forcing their religion on the people they conquered. In most conquered countries (e.g. Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Mexico, Taiwan and parts of India) laws were passed banning all non-Christian religions.

Take science. e development of science in the West was retarded by church opposition (see A History of the Warfare of Science with eology in Christendom , A. D. White, ). Christian opposition to dissection of corpses held back the devel - opment of medicine and anatomy for  years. e churches were against dissection because they believed that it would make bodily resurrection impossible. e church was opposed to the heliocentric view of the universe and even threatened to execute Galileo for saying that the earth moved around the sun. When Benjamin Franklin invented the lightning rod that prevented buildings from being damaged by lightning, Protestant clergy - men were in an uproar. ey believed that God would no longer be able to punish sinners by hurling thunder bolts at them. When chloroform was invented the churches refused to allow it to be used to alleviate the pain of childbirth. e Bible teaches and they believed that the pain of childbirth was God’s punishment on women for the sin of Eve (Gen :). Take the persecution of the Jews. Of all the black pages in the history of Christianity this is the blackest and most dis - graceful. For  years Christians have harassed, hounded, humiliated and murdered the Jews simply because they refused to believe in Jesus. In this respect Protestants have been no bet - ter than the Catholics. In  a leading Protestant clergyman"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"  in the U.S.A. said “God does not listen when the Jews pray”. Martin Luther, the founder of Protestant Christianity, wrote a book called the Jews and their Lies in which he advocated extreme persecution of Jews on the grounds that they did not believe in Jesus. Not surprisingly the Nazis used Luther’s book to justify their cruelty towards Jews. We could go on but perhaps this is enough. However, since the th century it is true that many Christian churches have begun to eagerly adopt the outlook of the liberal secular tradi - tion and make it their own. So now Christians are often in the forefront of movements for justice, democracy and equality. But there is little in the Bible that they can use to justify their actions. On the contrary, the Bible specifically says that all rulers, even the unjust, get their power from God and to oppose them is to oppose God. Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. erefore he who resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment (Rom :-, see also Jn :, Tit :, Pet :, Prov :-) Despotic kings, cardinals and bishops quoted passages like these for centuries to justify their rule. Liberation theologies are very silent about such Bible passages today. Christian social philosophy doesn’t come from the Bible. It comes from the Western secular tradition that the churches spent  years opposing. Now they try to pretend that these values originate from Jesus (see What the Bible Really Says , ed. M. Smith and R. S. Hoffman, )."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"  Buddhism has always been less aggressive and less organ - ized than Christianity. is has meant that its influence on society has been subtle, less noticeable and even perhaps less dynamic than it should have been. On the other hand it has also meant that the witch-hunts against heretics, the persecution of non-believers and the bloody religious wars that have marred Christian history, have been rare or absent in Buddhism. Buddhism may be a noble philosophy but if you look at Buddhist countries you notice that few people seem to practice it. Perhaps! But is it not exactly the same in Christian countries? What honest Christian can say that all Christians fully, sincerely and with deep understanding follow Jesus’ teachings? Let us not judge a religion by those who fail to practice it. onclusion What has been written so far may have stimulated in the reader the desire to know more about Christianity and Buddhism and so we will briefly recommend some books for further reading. A popular and easy to read book exposing many of the fallacies in Christianity is Jesus — the Evidence by Ian Wilson, . Wilson examines the history of the Bible and shows how scholars have demonstrated beyond doubt that it is an untidy compilation composed over several centuries. He also shows how the man Jesus gradually came to be seen as a god. Another good book is Rescuing the Bible from the Fundamentalists by John Spong, . Spong is a Christian bishop and scholar who freely admits that"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" much of what the Bible contains is either mythological or errone - ous, and he gives abundant evidence for this. e two best schol - arly and critical studies of recent times are Is Christianity True ? by Michael Arnheim,  and e Case Against Christianity by Michael Martin . ese outstanding studies examine every major Christian doctrine and exposes each of them to the cold light of reason and none of them survive the exposure. Many excellent books on the teachings of the Buddha are available. A good introduction is e Life of the Buddha by H. Saddhatissa, . It includes a well-written biography of the Buddha and a clear account of basic Buddhist concepts. What the Buddha Taught by W. Rahula,  and e Buddha’s Ancient Path by Piyadassi era,  are good introductions. A Buddhist Critique of the Christian Concept of God by G. Dharmasiri,  is an excel - lent but somewhat technical examination of the modern Protestant concept of God from the Buddhist point of view. A most interest - ing book is Two Masters One Message by Roy Amore, . In this study the author demonstrates that some of what was taught by Jesus is likely to have been derived originally from Buddhism. Fundamentalist Christianity poses a real threat to Buddhism and while we can never hope to match the aggressiveness or organizational abilities of its proponents, we can counter them by becoming familiar with Christianity’s numerous doctrinal weak - nesses and Buddhism’s many strengths. If the Christian challenge stimulates in Buddhists a deeper appreciation for the Dhamma and a desire to live by that Dhamma, then that challenge can be to Buddhism’s benefit. "}]
