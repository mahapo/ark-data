He became a novice at a young age and received higher ordination at the age of twenty. He followed the austere Forest Tradition for years, living in forests and begging for almsfood as he wandered about on mendicant pilgrimage. He practised meditation under a number of masters, among whom was Ajahn Mun, a highly respected and accomplished medita - tion teacher of the time. Ajahn Mun had an indelible influence on Ajahn Chah, giving his meditation practice the direction and clarity that it lacked. Ajahn Chah later became an accomplished meditation teacher in his own right, sharing his realization of the Dhamma with those who sought it. e essence of his teaching was rather simple: be mindful, don’t hang on to anything, let go and surrender to the way things are. Ajahn Chah passed away in peace after a long bout of illness on January 16, 1992, at his home monastery, Wat Pah Pong, in Ubon Ratchatani. For more information on books on Ajahn Chah write to: Wat Pah Nanachat, Bahn Bung Wai, Warinchamrab, Ubol Rajathani, ailand. Editor’s Note Due to popular demand, we have decided to separate the English and Mandarin parts of the original bilingual publications of A Tree in a Forest , Vols. I & II, and publish them under separate covers. Each new language edition has been divided into two parts: Part I consists of the 75 similes that appeared in the first volume of A Tree in a Forest , and Part II consists of the 108 similes that appeared in the second volume."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"v i vii Foreword e teachings of Ajahn Chah were originally made available to the English-speaking public by the efforts of his Western disciples who were able to translate from ai or Lao, the languages that Ajahn Chah taught in. Although for some time now these English publica - tions have been circulating in Chinese-speaking communities, partic - ularly in Singapore and Malaysia, and more recently in Taiwan, they have remained accessible only to those with an adequate knowledge of the English language. ese readers, inspired by Ajahn Chah’s teach - ings, have often expressed regret that those among their compatriots with little or no knowledge at all of English shouldn’t have the chance to benefit from the wisdom of Ajahn Chah’s words. For this reason, a joyfully willing and dedicated group made up of members from both the Buddhist monastic community and laity, decided to translate the works of Ajahn Chah. ey come from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, and all are blessed with the facility to work in both the English and Chinese languages. Also, and more importantly, they all have adequate experience and understanding of the Dhamma coupled with the “feel” and genuine appreciation of Ajahn Chah’s teachings. It is a credit to their goodness and sincere wish to spread the Dhamma in whatever way they can, that this work is now in your hands. We would like to acknowledge gratitude to all who took part in any aspect of the production of this book, be it designing, proofread - ing, copying, contributing toward the cost of its printing, and so on. May the Light of the Triple Gem continue to shine in their hearts and give them the peace and happiness they deserve. You will note that no one’s name has been mentioned and none given any special credit. is is just a way of following Ajahn Chah’s teaching of “not trying to be anything: not an arahant , not a bodhi - satta , nothing...” not even a translator.

For this reason, we are pleased that we have been able to take part in translating Ajahn Chah’s teachings into Chinese so that others, as well, may benefit from the light of wisdom that shines from his Dhamma talks. Translating the works of Ajahn Chah has not been an entirely easy task. ere ran the risk of using an over-literal approach which could sometimes end up sounding clumsy, or using a freer approach which although would read more smoothly, could turn out to be less accurate. ere was too the risk of sounding too academic which is not at all the style of Ajahn Chah. He himself read very little. In fact, when once asked which books of Buddhism he would recommend people to read, he replied, “Only one.” He then proceeded to point to his heart. So, each of us has had to compromise in different ways, but not in a way that has sacrificed the clear simplicity of Ajahn Chah’s talks nor their profound meaning. If the Dhamma “star” of Ajahn Chah has lost some of its original luster in the translation process, we hum - bly apologise. Yet we cannot help but feel that it is better to have a star out in the open to shine on everyone than for it to be shining, be it ever so brightly, in somebody’s pocket. In the end, there is never a best or last translation of anyone’s works, only different styles. As long as the essential meaning of what is being translated is captured and conveyed effectively, that is what matters. To you holding this book in your hands, even if it be only a mere glimmer of light that you catch from that “star” of Dhamma which shone so brightly from Ajahn Chah’s heart, and that glimmer of light should bring direction and inspiration into your life, we will feel that we have accomplished our task.

If we establish the Buddha within our mind, then we see everything, we contemplate everything, as no different from ourselves.” Many of the similes that Ajahn Chah himself used to teach came out of his vast experience of living in the forest. His practice was simply to watch, all the while being totally open and aware of everything that was happening both inside and outside himself. He would say that his practice was nothing special. He was, in his own words, like a tree in a forest. “A tree is as it is,” he’d say. And Ajahn Chah was as he was. But out of such “nothing specialness” came a profound understanding of himself and the world. Ajahn Chah used to say, “e Dhamma is revealing it - self in every moment, but only when the mind is quiet can we understand what it is saying, for the Dhamma teaches without words.” Ajahn Chah had this uncanny ability to take that wordless Dhamma and convey its truth to his listeners in the form of a simile that was fresh, easy to follow, sometimes humorous, sometimes poetic, but always striking a place in the heart where it would jar or inspire the most: “We are like mag - gots; life is like a falling leaf; our mind is like rain water.”"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"viii i x e teachings of Ajahn Chah teem with similes and com - parisons like these. We thought it would be a good idea to col - lect them all in the form of a book as a source of inspiration for those who may want some respite from the “heat of the world” and seek some rest in the cool and abundant shade of “a tree in the forest.” (ese similes have been gleaned from the following publications: Bodhinyana , A Taste of Freedom , Our Real Home , Samadhibhavana , Living Dhamma , Food for the Heart , A Still Forest Pool , and from a recently published book entitled Vener - able Father , A Life With Ajahn Chah , that was written by Paul Breiter.) In the olden days, they taught that we should gradually, ca-a-arefully gather in the net, feel our way with it, with - out losing it. is is how we practise.

Because we now accept the natural ways of children. Our outlook has changed and we now accept the true nature of things. We let go and our heart becomes more peaceful. We now have right understanding. C Mental activity is like a deadly poisonous cobra. If we don’t interfere with a cobra, it simply goes its own way.

Some people think that to have virtue you must memorize Pali phrases and chant all day and all night, but really all you have to do is make your body and speech blameless, and that’s virtue. It’s not so difficult to un - derstand. It’s just like cooking food — put in a little bit of this and a little bit of that till it’s just right and it’s delicious.

In the same way, the mind that has been trained will bring many times the blessings of that of an untrained mind. e Buddha and his Noble Disciples all started out in the same way as us — with untrained minds. But, afterwards, look how they became the subjects of reverence for us all. And see how much benefit we can gain from their teachings. Indeed see what benefits have come to the entire world from these men who had gone through the training of the mind to reach the freedom beyond. e mind controlled and trained is better equipped to help us in all professions, in all situations. e disciplined mind will keep our lives balanced, make work easier, and develop and nurture reason to govern our actions.

He starts again, but by then the initial heat he had has disappeared, so the going is slow. He just doesn’t keep at it long enough. He rubs and rubs until he is tired and then stops altogether. Not only is he tired, but he becomes more and more discouraged. “ere’s no fire here!” he finally decides and gives up completely. Actually he was doing the work, but there wasn’t enough heat to start the fire. e fire was there all the time, but he didn’t carry on to the end. Until we are able to reach peace, the mind will continue as before. For this reason the teacher says, “Just keep on doing it. Keep on with the practice!” Maybe we think, “If I don’t, yet understand, how can I do it?” Until we are able to practise properly, wisdom won’t arise. So we say just keep on with it. If we practise without stopping, we’ll begin to think about what we are doing, and consider our practice. F We don’t want desire, but if there is no desire why practise?

On the other hand, if he keeps on holding onto it and it turns out to be a snake, it may bite him. He’s just not sure.

Because he sees the danger — snakes can bite and make you very sick or kill you. Who has to tell him about that? In the same way, if we practise until we see things as they are, we won’t meddle with things that are harmful. F Our practice of contemplation will lead us to understanding. Let us take the example of a fisherman pulling in his net with a big fish in it. How do you think he feels about pulling it in? If he’s afraid that the fish will escape, he’ll rush and start to strug - gle with the net, grabbing and tugging at it. Before he knows it, the big fish has escaped. e fisherman was trying too hard. In the olden days, they taught that we should do it grad - ually, carefully gathering it in without losing it. is is how it is in our practice. We gradually feel our way with it, carefully gathering it in without losing it. Sometimes it happens that we don’t feel like doing it. Maybe we don’t want to look, or maybe we don’t want to know, but we keep on with it. We continue feeling for it. is is the practice. If we feel like doing it, we do it.

We may continue with it for a long time and a feeling will arise that we are not going to find the Way.

At this point, we must be very, very careful. We must use patience and endurance. It’s just like pulling in the big fish — we gradually feel our way with it, we carefully pull it in. e struggle won’t be too difficult, so we continue to pull it in without stopping.

It means to hold but not to cling. Take this flashlight, for example. We wonder: “What is this?” So we pick it up: “Oh, it’s a flashlight.” en we put it down again. We hold things in this way. If we didn’t hold anything at all, what could we do? We couldn’t do walking med - itation or anything else, so we must hold things first.

We know and then we let go. We don’t foolishly cling to things, but we “hold” them with wisdom and then let them go. Good or bad, we let them all go.

Don’t drive over here!” It’s a freeway. You can’t tell them that. So what can you do? You get off the road. e road is the place where cars run. If you don’t want the cars to be there, you suffer.

Some people die while still in the womb, others within only a few days after birth. Some people live for a few years, then die, never having reached maturity. Men and women die in their youth. Still others reach a ripe old age before they die. When reflecting upon people, consider the nature of fruit in the wind — both are uncertain. Our minds are also similar.

T Fostering the practice of Buddhism can be likened to a tree. A tree has roots, a trunk, branches and leaves. Every single leaf and branch, including the trunk, depend on the roots to ab - sorb nutriment and send it up to them. A tree is dependent on the roots for sustenance. We are the same. Our actions and our speech are like the trunk, branches, and twigs. e mind is like the root which absorbs nutriment and sends it out to sustain them which in turn bear fruit. Whatever state the mind is in, be it based in wrong view or right view, it expresses that wrong view or right view outwardly through our actions and speech. So nurturing Buddhism through the practical application of the Teachings is very important.

Trees by nature don’t know anything. ey act on natural laws, yet they do know enough to grow away from danger, to incline toward a suitable place. People are like this. We want to transcend suffering, and if that which we like and that which we don’t like are suffering, we should then not go so close to them, not be cramped by them. When we incline toward the Buddha, suffering will lessen and eventually come to a complete end. V Worldly people usually speak out of vanity. For example, sup - pose there was a certain person whom you hadn’t seen for a long time, and then one day you happen to meet on the train: “Oh, I’m so glad to see you! I was just thinking to look you up!” Actually it’s not so. You hadn’t even thought of him at all, but you just say so at the time out of gladness. And so it becomes a lie. Yes, it’s lying out of heedlessness. is is a refined form of lying, and people tend to speak like this. is, too, is a defile - ment which we should practise to get rid of.

If the tree is growing straight and upwards, the vine, too, will grow straight and upwards. If the tree is growing crooked and sideways, so will the vine. Understand that your teaching of a child really comes more from how you are and what the child sees than from any - thing you say. So your practice is not just your own, but also for your children... and others around you. V Many people who have studied on a university level and attained graduate degrees and worldly success find that there is still something missing in their lives.

If the buffalo goes near the rice plants, he yells at it and the buffalo backs off. If it doesn’t obey, it gets to feel the hard end of a stick. e person watching the buffalo can’t doze off either, or he’ll get up finding the rice plants all eaten away. e mind is like the buffalo, and the rice plants are like the sense objects. e one who knows is the owner.

You’ ll find the whole Dhamma revealing itself here and now. At what other time and place are you going to look? With even a little intuitive wisdom we will be able to see clearly through the ways of the world. We will come to understand that everything in the world is a teacher.
