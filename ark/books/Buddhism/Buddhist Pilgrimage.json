Before He passed into Mahaparinibbana, the Buddha advised pious dis - ciples to visit four places that may be for their inspiration after He was gone. They are Lumbini, where He was born; Buddhagaya, where He attained Supreme Enlightenment; Deer Park in Sarnath, where He preached the First Sermon; and Kusinara, where He passed into Mahaparinibbana. The pious disciple should visit these places and look upon them with feelings of reverence, reflecting on the particular event of the Buddha’s life connected with each place. Since the Mahaparinibbana of the Buddha, these four shrines of Buddhism have become the focal points for pious disciples to rally around and seek inspiration. By the time of King Asoka, four more places, namely: Savatthi, Sankasia, Rajagaha and Vesali, that were closely associated with the Buddha and scenes of His princi - pal miracles, were added to the pilgrimage itinerary. Together they make the Eight Great Places of pilgrimage. The aim of this book is to share my experience and knowledge with fellow Buddhists about the benefits of undertaking a pilgrim - age to the Eight Great Places with the correct mental attitude. In Buddhism, understanding plays the key role in one’s spiritual progress. So, for the intending pilgrim, it is imperative to under - stand that a pilgrimage is essentially a spiritual journey in ven - eration of the Blessed One. This act of veneration purifies one’s thoughts, speech and action and through it, many noble qualities"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"2 3 can be developed. Part I of this book discusses these mental aspects. A book on Buddhist pilgrimage would not be complete without reference to the famous pilgrims of old, namely: Asoka and the Chinese pilgrims, whose faith and fortitude are an inspiration to all who follow their footsteps. The downfall of Buddhism and the devastation of Buddhist shrines in the 13 th century followed by six centuries of oblivion, which was the darkest period of Buddhism, is retold in this book. Finally, the restoration of Buddhist shrines and the revival of Buddhism in India is described to enable the reader to appreciate the efforts of the great men who have dedicated their lives to restore the holy shrines back to their past glory. Parts II & III of this book trace the history and religious significance of each of the Eight Great Places and the objects of interest that can be found there. Part IV provides information on travelling around the Buddhist circuit (as the area is now called), road distances and maps showing the locations of the shrines. A pilgrimage to the Eight Great Places can be one of the happiest and most fulfilling moments of one’s life and make one realize how fortunate it is to be able to gaze upon these ancient sacred shrines, with feelings of reverence. It is hoped that this book will be useful to readers who intend to go on a pilgrimage and encourage more Buddhists to undertake a pilgrimage so that they too, can benefit from the jour - ney of piety and faith.

FORGIVENESS OF FAULTS During the two weeks or so of the pilgrimage, it is inevitable for many of the pilgrims, including the author, to lapse into moments of heedlessness and commit faults through body, speech or mind against our spiritual advisors or against our fellow pilgrims. On behalf of all the members concerned, the author takes this oppor - tunity to ask for forgiveness from our spiritual advisors and also from each other. If we had been heedless at the holy shrines, we too seek forgiveness from the Buddha , Dhamma and Sangha.

Mental Aspects of a Pilgrimage * 24 a) Faith and Reverence For the majority of Buddhists, going on a pilgrimage to the holy places mentioned by the Buddha, is a once-a-lifetime undertak - ing. With so much time, money and effort involved, it behoves the intending pilgrim to truly understand what a pilgrimage is all about, especially the mental aspect , since the physical part is normally taken care of by a travel company. A pilgrimage is a jour - ney to a sacred place as an act of devotion and faith . In the scrip - tures, faith or saddha is the professing of confidence in and the sense of assurance based on understanding that one places on the Buddha , Dhamma and Sangha . It is not the blind belief based on wrong view. As ignorance is the leader of immoral mental states, so saddha is the leader of moral mental states because its chief characteristic is the purification of the mind. Thus the pilgrim is not an ordinary tourist who travels for the pleas - ure of sightseeing and enjoyment. Unlike sensual delights, the sight of the holy shrines does not arouse craving but acts as a condition for wholesome mental states to arise in the pilgrim’s mind. The Buddha himself advised us to visit those places where he was born , where he attained Enlightenment , where he preached the First Sermon and where he passed away into Mahaparinibbana , and look upon them with feelings of reverence . By showing veneration or reverence at the holy shrines, one is able to purify one’s thought, speech and action. In this way, the pilgrim is endowed with the mor- * Throughout this book the blue superscript numbers following headings are linked to the Bibliography, which begins on page 149.

RETURN"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"1 2 1 3 ality of Right Thought , Right Speech and Right Action . So we can see that visiting the places of pilgrimage with the correct men - tal attitude can help us in our practice of the Buddha’s Teaching. According to the great commentator, Ven . Buddhaghosa , the posi - tive feeling produced by seeing these sites is the religious excitement or the sense of urgency they produce. Another commentator, Ven . Dhammapala , explained that this sense of urgency means the mind possesses the knowledge that one should shrink from doing wrong , namely, the knowledge of morality . b) Four Bases of Success Like all meritorious actions ( punna kiriya ) , the potency of one’s volition depends on the intensity of the four bases of success ( iddhipada ) , namely: desire-to-do ( chanda ) , mind ( citta ) , effort ( viriya ) and knowledge ( vimansa ) . It is superior, medium or inferior when these four bases are strong, medium or weak respectively. A strong desire stems from one’s devotion to undertake a pilgrimage in order to heed the Buddha’s advice . When the mind or will is strong, it is not easily distracted from its objective, nor discouraged by the rigours of the journey. Effort means the energy to undertake the journey, which in olden days meant travelling long distances on land, sea or across desert. Nowadays travelling by plane and air- conditioned bus is easier and faster, but preparations are essential, especially finding out the significance of each holy shrine. With this knowledge , one is able to associate each place with a certain event in the Buddha’s life and form a mental picture to condition the arising of wholesome mental states when visiting that place. This success comes from one’s prior effort in preparing for the pilgrim - age. All these ingredients were present in the hearts of the Chinese pilgrims , Fa Hsien, Hsüan Tsang, I-Ching and many others, when they embarked on their journey to India centuries ago."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"1 2 1 3 c) Development of the Perfections (Paramis) The second aspect of a pilgrimage is that it is also an act of renunciation whereby the pilgrim does not crave for luxury but is contented with simple, clean accommodation, food and transport. This non-greed state of mind enables one to endure any discom - fort without complaint but with patience and loving-kindness . In the course of visiting the sacred places, one feels that one is in the Master’s presence and this fullness of faith conduces to joy and the observance of morality , the foundation of all merit. Many pil - grims take the opportunity to bring with them requisites to per - form dana out of reverence and gratitude to the Sangha, who take care of the holy places. The holy shrines are also conducive places for pilgrims to reflect on the Buddha’s virtues and practise mind - fulness to develop wisdom . These are various practices by which one can show veneration at the holy shrines or cetiyas in addition to the normal acts of devotion like the offering of flowers, lights, incense, and worship ( puja ) . In the course of the pilgrimage, one can arouse many wholesome factors that cause one’s volition to become superior and lead to the accumulation of superior whole - some kamma . Indeed, one can develop the Perfections ( Paramis) and earn much merit when going on a pilgrimage. But it should not end when one has returned home. After the journey is over, one should always try to recollect the joyful moments spent at holy places to keep them vivid in one’s memory. Such recollec - tion is productive of joy and is a skillful means of re-enforcing one’s good kamma already acquired. In times of sickness, fear and worry, or sorrow, one can easily dispel these negative mental states by rejoicing in one’s wholesome actions during the pilgrimage."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"1 4 1 5 d) Buddhist Fellowship Fellowship means a community of interest involving regular meetings, the sharing of responsibilities and good friendship for mutual support. This aspect of Buddhist fellowship is important in order to encourage and help one another in the practice of the Buddha’s Teachings and strengthen our faith in times of trial and tribulation. A pilgrimage in a group to the Eight Great Places is one of the best ways to cultivate Buddhist fellowship . Over the two weeks or so of the journey, members of the group will have the opportunity to interact closely and get to know each other well under conditions whereby loving-kindness , appreciative joy , generosity and faith prevail. The bonds of comradeship formed through the performance of meritorious actions together will endure long after the pilgrimage is over and members will cherish fond memories of each other whenever they recollect the happy moments spent at the holy places. A journey to the Eight Great Places with fellow Buddhists united by faith and piety is true Buddhist fellowship and a wonderful way of forging friendship ."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"1 4 1 5 2. Eight Great Places of Pilgrimage 2, 3 In answer to Venerable Ananda’s concern that the monks would no longer be able to see the Buddha and pay their respects after His Mahaparinibbana , Lord Buddha mentioned four places which a pious disciple should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence . What are the four? a) Lumbini : “Here the Tathagata was born ! This, Ananda, is a place that a pious man should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence.” b) Buddhagaya : “Here the Tathagata became fully enlightened, in unsurpassed, Supreme Enlightenment! This, Ananda, is a place that a pious man should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence.” c) Sarnath : “Here the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled Wheel of the Law! This, Ananda, is a place that a pious man should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence.” d) Kusinara : “Here the Tathagata passed away into Nibbana wherein the elements of clinging do not arise! This, Ananda, is a place that a pious man should visit and look upon with feel - ings of reverence.” “And whosoever, Ananda, should die on such a pilgrimage, with his heart established in faith, he at the breaking up of the body, after death, will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happiness.” Mahaparinibbana Sutta The four other sacred sites are the places sanctified by the Buddha and scenes of four principal miracles that He performed, namely:"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"1 6 1 7 e) Savatthi , where the Buddha performed the Twin Miracle to silence the heretics, after which He ascended to Tavatimsa Heaven to preach to His mother. f ) Sankasia , where the Buddha descended from Tavatimsa Heaven accompanied by Brahma and Sakka, after preaching to His mother and the devas for three months. g) Rajagaha , where the Buddha tamed the drunken elephant, Nalagiri. h) Vesali , where a band of monkeys dug a pond for the Buddha’s use and offered Him a bowl of honey. Together, they make the eight great places of Buddhist pilgrimage. Of the eight, seven are in India while the eighth, the Buddha’s birthplace, Lumbini, is in Nepal . According to the Buddhavamsa Commentary (Pages 188, 428), for all Buddhas there are four places that do not vary or are unalterable , namely: (i) the seat of Enlightenment ( Bodhi pallanka ) at Bodhgaya , (ii) the turning of the wheel of Dhamma in Deer Park, Isipatana at Sarnath , (iii) the placing of the first footstep at the gate of the city of Sankasia at the Descent from Heaven, (iv) the placement of the four legs of the bed in the Perfumed Chamber ( Gandhakuti ) at Jetavana in Savatthi . The four unalterable places of all Buddhas are included in the Eight Great Places of Pilgrimage. Note: The names of some of the places mentioned in the Pali scriptures are no longer used in India. Their modern names are in parentheses: Buddhagaya (Bodhgaya) , Kusinara (Kushinagar) , Rajagaha (Rajgir) , Savatthi (Sravasti) and Vesali (Vaishali) ."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"1 6 1 7 3. Famous Pilgrims of the Past 6, 10, 11, 12 The four sacred places and four places of miracles are known as Atthamahathanani or the Eight Great Places . Emperor Asoka called a visit to these eight shrines “ dhammayatra ” ( dhamma ex- pedition) or a pilgrimage of piety. On his twentieth regnal year in 249 BC , he heeded the exhortation of the Buddha and embarked on a holy pilgrimage visiting all these places. His pilgrimage was literally a “ landmark ” journey because wherever he went, he built stupas and raised pillars with inscriptions to commemorate his visit to these holy places. These towering monolithic pillars made of polished sandstone and topped with animal capitals have helped to identify the exact locations of the Buddhist world’s most sacred places even after they fell into ruins following the downfall of Buddhism in India. Today after 2,250 years, many of these Asokan pillars still stand proclaiming his faith and devotion . Modern day pilgrims can still see these Asokan pillars in Lumbini, Kapilavatthu and Vesali, the famous Lion Capital at Sarnath Museum and the Elephant Capital at Sankasia. Asoka’s example was emulated by succeeding Buddhist kings, queens, nobles and wealthy men and women. As a result, India became studded with Buddhist monu - ments and shrines. From China came the devout and earnest Buddhist monks, like Fa Hsien , Hsüan Tsang and many others, who travelled great distances braving immense hardships, perils, and even death to fulfill their desire to visit the holy places. In the Kao-seng-chuan (Chinese Monks in India, by I-Ching), another pilgrim, I-Ching , described how he had to pass many days without food, even with - out a drop of water and wondered how the other travellers, under such difficult conditions, could keep up their morale and spirit."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"1 8 1 9 On the long, long trek, many died from sheer physical exhaus - tion or sickness and some had to leave their bones in desert-sands or somewhere out in India. Yet, in spite of these difficulties, they never faltered nor wavered, such was their indomitable spirit and desire to gaze on the sacred vestiges of their religion. Never did men endure greater suffering by desert , mountain and sea and ex - hibit such courage , religious devotion and powers of endurance! The pioneer among them was Fa Hsien . He took five years to walk from the Western border of China across the Takla Makan desert, one of the most hostile environments on this planet, and over the windswept passes of the Pamir and Hindu Kush mountain ranges to Northern India. After spending six years in India, he sailed to Sri Lanka, where he spent two more years. His homeward journey by sea took another year in which he stopped for five months in Java. Fa Hsien left an account of his journey of 399-414 AD in the Fo-kwo-ki (Record of the Buddhist Country). One hundred years after Fa Hsien, two monks, Sung Yun and Hui Sheng of Loyang (Honan-fu), were sent by the Empress of the Northern Wei dynasty to obtain Buddhist books from India. They started out in 518 AD and after reaching as far as Peshawar and Nagarahara (Jalalabad), returned to China in 521 AD . Sung Yun left a short narrative of his travels but Hui Sheng did not record any details of the journey. Undoubtedly the most renowned Chinese pilgrim was the great Tipitaka master, Hsüan Tsang , who secretly set out on the long journey to the West in 629 AD at the age of twenty-seven. His travel in India was the most extensive, taking almost seventeen years ( 629-645 AD ) and when he returned to China, he was given a great ovation and public honour by the T’ang Emperor, T’ai Tsung. Hsüan Tsang’s record of his travels, known as Si-yü-ki (Record of the Western World), is a detailed and romantic account"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"1 8 1 9 of the Buddhist shrines in India and other countries he passed through. His devotion, piety and love for learning became a source of inspiration to his contemporaries and later generation of pilgrims including I-Ching , who took the sea route to India and back. His travels covered the period 671-695 AD in which he spent ten years studying in Nalanda and another ten years in Sri- vijaya, Sumatra translating the scriptures. He wrote his account in the Nan-hai-ki-kuei-nai-fachuan (Record of the Inner Law sent home from the South Sea). The records of the Chinese pilgrims are the only available writ - ings describing the condition of Buddhism and the Buddhist sites as they existed at that time and have proven to be invaluable in locating their ruins during excavations in the 19 th century by Sir Alexander Cunningham and others."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"2 0 2 1 4. Record of the Buddhist Country by Fa Hsien Fa Hsien went to India with some fellow monks, namely: Hui- king, Tao-ching, Hui-ying, Hui-yu and others, for the purpose of seeking the Vinaya or Monastic Rules . Starting from Ch’ang-an (Xian) in 399 AD, they travelled by stages on foot till they reached Chang-yeh , a military station at the north-west extremity of the Great Wall, where they met another party of Chinese monks led by Pao-yun and Sung-king, also on their way to India. After spending the rainy season together in Chang-yeh, they pressed on to Dunhuang at the edge of the Takla Makan desert, where they stopped for over a month. The local prefect provided them with the necessities to cross the desert and Fa Hsien’s party started out first on their long trek across the Takla Makan desert. Walking for seventeen days about 1,500 li (1 li = 1 mile) in a south-westerly direction, keeping to the edge of the desert, they reached the rug - ged and barren country of Shen-shen (Loulan), south of Lop Nor . The king of this country honoured the Buddhist religion and there were some 4,000 monks, belonging to the Small Vehicle or Hinayana 1 . After resting there for about a month, they travelled 1 One hundred years after the Buddha’s Parinibbana , the Second Buddhist Council was held at Vesali to discuss the Ten Points practised by the Vajjian monks. Although the Ten Points were ruled to be unlawful by the Council, the Vajjian monks did not accept the verdict. This resulted in a schism in the Sangha and the secession of the Mahasanghika (Vajjian monks), believed to be the forerunners of the Mahayana . From then on further schisms led to the formation of different sub-sects until eighteen schools of Buddhism arose. The name Hinayana was applied to these schools by the followers of the Mahayana tradition, which developed sometime immediately prior to the Christian era.

There, they met again the party of monks led by Pao-yun , who had travelled by the northern route to Hami and Turfan . While Fa Hsien’s group remained at Kara-shahr under the protection of an important official, Pao-yun’s group were not so lucky and they had to return to Turfan to procure the necessities for their jour - ney. After staying in Kara-shahr for two months, Fa Hsien and his company continued their journey south-west across the desert. On the road, there were no dwellings or people. The sufferings of their journey on account of the difficulties of the road and rivers exceeded human comparison . They were on the road for a month and five days before they reached the prosperous, oasis town of Khotan . The ruler of the country provided them with accom - modation in a monastery where they stayed for three months and were able to witness the grand procession of images, which began on the first day of the fourth month and lasted for fourteen days. From Khotan, the pilgrims spent twenty-five days on the road to Yarkand , where they stopped for fifteen days before continu - ing their journey. After another twenty-five days of walking, they arrived at Kashgar , in the middle of the Tsung-ling range (Pamirs) , in time to witness the Pancavassika Parisa or Quinquennial assembly , a five-yearly event instituted by King Asoka , in which the ruler made a great offering to the Sangha. Leaving Kashgar, they entered Tajikistan through the Sarykol range, taking a month to cross the Pamir mountains, and continued their journey south-west for fifteen days over a difficult, precipitous and danger - ous road. Fa Hsien described it thus:"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"2 2 2 3 “The mountain side is simply a stone wall standing up 10,000 feet. Looking down, the sight is confused and there is no sure foothold. Below is a river called Sint’u-ho ( Indus) . In old days, men had cut away the rocks to make a way down and spread out side ladders, of which there are 700 steps to pass. When these are negotiated, the river is crossed by a hanging rope bridge. The two banks of the river are something less than 80 paces apart.” After crossing the river, they arrived at the country of Udyana , which comprises the regions from Chitral to Swat in present day Northern Pakistan . It was then a flourishing centre of Buddhism, with five hundred monasteries belonging to the Small Vehicle. Three of the pilgrims, Hui-king, Tao-ching and Hui Yu went on ahead to Nagarahara (Jalalabad) to pay reverence to the Buddha-shadow 2 at the Gopala Naga cave and the tooth and skull bone relics at Hadda while Fa Hsien and Hui Ying remained at Udyana to spend the rains-retreat. When this was over, they journeyed south to Swat and descending eastward for five days arrived at Gandhara (region between Takkasila and modern day Charsadda). From there, they travelled south to Peshawar to see the famed stupa of Kaniska and the alms-bowl relic. Here they met the party of Pao-yun and Sung-king who had come to pay homage to the alms-bowl relic. One of Fa Hsien’s friends, Hui-yu , who had previously gone to Nagarahara also came to Peshawar 2 According to a popular legend among the Chinese pilgrims, the Buddha left his shadow in a cave on the mountainside in Nagarahara (old capital of the Jalalabad district). This cav - ern was the abode of a destructive dragon, Naga Gopala, who was planning to destroy the kingdom for a slight offence against him when he was a shepherd in a former life. Out of compassion for the inhabitants, the Buddha came to Nagarahara from mid India and after taming the dragon, left his shadow on the wall of the Naga Gopala cave. The Buddha advised the dragon to look at his shadow whenever evil intentions arose in his mind and by its power of love and virtue, the evil purpose would be stopped. In later days, the shadow was not visible any more."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"2 2 2 3 and at this point, he decided to return to China with Pao-yun and Sung-king. Meanwhile Fa Hsien’s companion, Hui-ying , dwelling in the temple of the alms-bowl relic, died there. Fa Hsien now proceeded alone westward to Nagarahara. On the borders, in the city of Hadda , he visited the vihara of the Buddha’s skull-bone . At the capital of Nagarahara , he visited the viharas of the Buddha’s religious staff and sanghati (outer robe) and the Gopala Naga cave to pay homage to the Buddha shadow. He teamed up with his two remaining companions, Tao-ching and Hui-king and together they spent two months of winter there. When winter was over, they proceeded south and encoun - tered great difficulties and extreme cold crossing the Safed Koh mountain range. Hui-king , barely recovering from an earlier ill - ness, was unable to proceed onwards. He died of exhaustion in Fa Hsien’s arms, urging them to press on lest they too perished. With great effort, the surviving pilgrims crossed the mountain range and entered Afghanistan where they spent the rains-retreat in the company of 3,000 monks in the vicinity. After the rains-retreat they crossed the Punjab, where they saw the Buddhist religion flourishing and after passing many monasteries with myraids of monks, the pilgrims reached Mathura country. Fa Hsien then visited in succession Sankasia , Kanauj , Saketa or Ayodha and Savatthi , where the monks at Jetavana monastery were astonished to see them, for they had not seen men from Han (Chinese) come so far as this before in search of the Buddha’s law. Moving eastward, they travelled to the ancient Sakyan kingdom, where they visited the birthplaces of Kakusandha Buddha and Kanakagamana Buddha and saw the Asokan pillars erected there. The capital, Kapilavatthu , was like a great desert, without any in - habitants. There were only a congregation of monks and about ten"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"2 4 2 5 families of lay people. The roads were devoid of travellers for fear of wild elephants and lions. From Kapilavatthu, the pilgrims travelled to Kusinara , scene of the Buddha’s Mahaparinibbana. In this city too, there were few inhabitants and such families as were there, were connected with the congregation of monks. Moving onwards, they went to Vesali and Pataliputta , the capital of ancient Magadha . From there, they moved on to Nalanda and Rajagaha , where Fa Hsien ascended Gijjhakuta hill and after offering flowers, incense and lights, re - mained there the whole night contemplating and reciting the suttas. Continuing the pilgrimage, they went to Buddhagaya , scene of the Buddha’s Enlightenment, Deer Park at Sarnath where the Buddha preached the First Sermon , Varanasi and lastly Kosambi in Allahabad district, where they visited the ruins of Ghositarama monastery. Returning to Pataliputta, Tao-ching decided to take up permanent residence in India after seeing the strict decorum observed by the monks in India with regard to the Disciplinary rules compared with the meagre character of the precepts known in China. For Fa Hsien, the purpose of his sojourn was to seek copies of the Monastic Rules to take home but throughout the journey, he was unable to obtain a single copy as the rules were transmitted orally . Here he was able to obtain a copy used by the Mahasanghikas at Jetavana monastery. Fa Hsien spent three years learning Sanskrit and copying out the Rules. Then following the course of the Ganges river in an easterly direction, he travelled to Tamralipti ( modern Tamluk in West Bengal), where he spent a further two years copying the sacred texts and drawing image pictures. From the port of Tamralipti, he took a ship to Sri Lanka where he spent"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"2 4 2 5 two more years collecting and copying the Buddhist texts includ - ing the Mahisasaka monastic rules, unknown in China. Fa Hsien had been away from his homeland for many years. Of the four monks who accompanied him to India, one returned to China after going only as far as Peshawar, two died in India and one remained behind in India. At the Abhayagiri monastery in Anuradhapura , the sight of a merchant making a religious offering of a white silk fan from China, made him feel sad and homesick. Having completed his original purpose of obtaining the knowledge of the precepts to spread throughout the land of Han, he decided to return home. In his voyage home by sea , he had several miracu - lous escapes. His ship sprung a leak during a violent storm and was driven to the island of Java, where he spent five months. He took another boat bound for Canton but after a month and some days, he encountered another storm that drove the boat off course and landed on the shores of the Shantung Peninsula instead. Yet in spite of all the perils of the sea, he had managed to return home safely with his precious cargo of the sacred texts intact. After resting at Tsing-Chow for the summer, he proceeded to Nanking where he exhibited the sacred books he had brought back. He was away fourteen years and had encountered great hardships and dangers in his travels through nearly thirty differ - ent countries . Having been protected by the power of the Triple Gem and delivered safely from all dangers, he desired to share his experiences with readers by writing these records of his travels from 399-414 AD. He died at the age of eighty-six after having accomplished his mission of translating into Chinese the Buddhist texts, which he had taken so much time and trouble to bring back from India."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"2 6 2 7 5. Record of the Western World by Hsüan Tsang The T’ang Dynasty Record of the Western World is an objective record composed in twelve books by the famous Chinese pilgrim Hsüan Tsang about his epic journey from China to Central Asia and the Indian Sub-Continent and back in 629-645 AD. It should not be confused with the popular Chinese fiction Si-yü-ki or Travels to the West featuring the adventures of the mythical Monkey God , which have been made into films and TV shows for entertainment. While Fa Hsien went to India to seek the Vinaya or Monastic Rules, Hsüan Tsang’s purpose of going to India was to learn from the wise men there on the points of doctrine that were troubling his mind. When his application to leave China was refused by the authorities, he departed in secret from Chang’an (Xian) in 629 AD at the age of twenty-seven. Heading up the Gansu cor - ridor, he passed Lanzhou and worked his way to the end of the Great Wall near Dunhuang . There he took the northern branch of the Silk route passing through Yumen Guan (Jade Gate Pass) and after crossing the Gobi desert, arrived at Hami . There, he was summoned to Turfan , the capital of the Uighur country, by its pious Buddhist ruler to become the country’s chief priest, which Hsüan Tsang declined. After failing in his attempt to detain Hsüan Tsang, he remitted the pilgrim to Kara-shahr , from which he advanced to Kucha . Kucha was an oasis town on the edge of the desert, famous for its excellent horses. The ground was rich in minerals and its soil was suitable for agriculture. It had one hundred monasteries with over"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"2 6 2 7 five thousand Sarvastivadin monks. All the monasteries had high - ly adorned images of the Buddha, which were paraded on special occasions in a procession of idol-carriages. In Kucha, the king ob - served the Quinquennial Assembly , originally instituted by King Asoka , whereby a great offering was made to the Sangha every five years. Outside the main city gate, Hsüan Tsang saw two erect fig - ures of the Buddha, about 90 feet tall, and in front of them was a place erected specially for this festival. After staying here for two months, he continued his journey to Aksu and crossing the snowy Tian Shan mountains, reached the shores of lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgyzstan . This mountain lake, 5,200 feet above sea level, is the second largest in the world covering an area of 6,200 sq. km. He then proceeded north-west along the fertile valley of the Chu river passing the Kyrgyz lake-land area of Myn-bulak , known as the “ Thousand springs ”. Moving westward, he passed the Tartar town of Taras and the country of Nujkend on the Chatkal range , and arrived at Tashkent in Eastern Uzbekistan , which was then under the control of the Tuh-kiueh (Huns or Eastern Turks). The next stop was Samarkand , a very populous country located at the junction of the trade routes between China and India. It was the emporium of the Silk route where the merchants bartered their goods, and according to Hsüan Tsang, “The precious merchandise of many countries is stored up here. Its inhabitants are skilful in the arts and trades beyond those of other countries. The people are brave and energetic and are copied by all surrounding people in point of politeness and propriety.” From Samarkand, the pilgrim proceeded to Kesh (Karshi) and moving south, entered the mountains. After climbing the steep"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"2 8 2 9 and precipitous road, he arrived at the Iron Gate , a mountain pass bordered on both sides by very high rocky walls with an iron col - our. Here double wooden doors had been erected and many bells were fixed on them. The doors were strengthened with iron and impregnable. Because of the protection afforded to the pass when these doors were closed, the pass was called Iron Gate. Passing Iron Gate, he reached Tukhara , a country controlled by the Turks and crossing the Oxus river (Amu Darya) near Termez , arrived at Kunduz in Afghanistan. Here he met the eldest son of the Turkish Khan, brother-in-law of the king of Turfan, from whom Hsüan Tsang had letters of recommendation. After some delay, he pro - ceeded with some monks from Balkh to that city, formerly capi - tal of the Bactrian kingdom of Milinda . It had about a hundred monasteries and three thousand monks. After paying reverence to the sacred relics, he departed from Balkh and made the difficult and dangerous journey across the Hindu Kush mountains to Bamiyan . Here the people worshipped the Triple Gem but still maintained a hundred tutelary deities, which the merchants sought to propitiate when business was bad. There were ten monasteries with about a thousand monks of the Lokuttaravadin school. Hsüan Tsang saw the two colossal Buddha images , about 55 and 35 metres tall, carved out of a mountain- side in the 4 th and 5 th centuries AD, and mistook the smaller one to be bronze due to its gilded surface. He also saw a large reclining Buddha image and paid reverence to some tooth relics. ( Note : In an act of religious bigotry , the fanatical Talibans of Afghanistan destroyed the ancient Buddha images in 2001, despite worldwide protests and condemnations.) Moving eastward, Hsüan Tsang entered the passes of the Hindu Kush and crossing the Siah Koh ridge, arrived at the country of"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"2 8 2 9 Kapisa . It had one about hundred monasteries with six thousand Mahayana monks and a great monastery with three hundred monks of the Small Vehicle. There were also some ten Deva tem - ples with about a thousand Hindu ascetics of various sects, such as naked ascetics ( Digambaras ) , those who covered their bodies with ashes ( Pasupatas ) and those who wore chaplets of bones on their heads ( Kapaladharinas ) . Every year, the king would make a silver image of the Buddha and offer alms to the poor, desti - tute and bereaved in his kingdom. After spending the summer of 630 AD in Kapisa, Hsüan Tsang went to Nagarahara (Jalalabad). Here he found many monasteries but few monks. The stupas were desolate and ruined. He visited the famous Naga Gopala cave, which according to legend, once contained the shadow left by the Buddha after he had tamed the naga (serpent). At the vihara of the skull-bone relic, he found that the caretakers were Brahmans appointed by the king and they charged the worshippers a fee in order to see the relic. From Nagarahara, the pilgrim entered Gandhara by the Khyber Pass . Here he found the towns and villages deserted with few in - habitants. There were about a thousand monasteries, which were in ruins , overgrown with wild shrubs and empty. The stupas were mostly decayed . At the capital, Purushapura (Peshawar), there was only one monastery with fifty Mahayana monks. However, the Deva temples numbering about one hundred were fully occu - pied with heretics. According to Hsüan Tsang, “Centuries ago, there was a treacherous Hun king from Sakala named Mahirakula , who killed his benefactor, the king of Kashmir and usurped the throne. Then he came to Gandhara and killed its ruler in an ambush. He extermi - nated the royal family and the chief minister, overthrew the"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"3 0 3 1 stupas and destroyed the monasteries, altogether one thousand six hundred foundations.” Travelling north, the pilgrim arrived at Udyana , a flourishing centre of Buddhism during the time of Fa Hsien. But now, all its one thousand four hundred olden monasteries lay waste and desolate. Formerly, there were some eighteen thousand monks but now there were very few. After visiting the shrines, he continued his journey to Takkasila (near Rawalpindi). Here again, he saw the aftermath of the devastation by the Hun king Mahirakula – many monasteries destroyed and deserted. From Takkasila, he went to Kashmir where Buddhism still prevailed. There were still a hundred monasteries and five thousand monks. It appeared that after the death of Mahirakula, his descendants, who then ruled Kashmir, atoned for his misdeeds by erecting stupas and monaster - ies for the Buddhists. At the capital Srinagar , Hsüan Tsang spent two years (631-633 AD) studying philosophy and copying the scriptures under a Mahayanist teacher. From Kashmir, the pilgrim travelled south passing Jammu and reached Sakala (Sialkot near Lahore), the seat of the Bactrian king Milinda of old and of the infamous Mahirakula of late. As he was leaving Sakala, he was robbed by brigands and spent the night in a neighbouring village. Moving on, he reached a large town, proba - bly Lahore , where he remained for a month. Then he went to stay a year in Chinapati . In 634 AD, he travelled to Jalandhar and reach - ing the Sutlej river, passed Satadru and Paryartra before arriving at Mathura . Along the way, he could see the decline of Buddhism and the rise of neo-Brahmanism of the Gupta age. Mathura, a stronghold of Buddhism during the time of King Asoka and cen - tre of the Sarvastavadin school under the famous monk Upagupta , was now a shadow of its past, with only twenty monasteries and"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"3 0 3 1 two thousand monks. After visiting the local shrines, the pilgrim ascended the Yamuna river to Kuru-kshetra (Thaneswar), the holy land of the Hindus and scene of the legendary Mahabharata wars between the Pandava brothers and the Kauravas, cousins as well as bitter rivals. There were only three monasteries with about seven hundred monks but one hundred Deva temples with great numbers of various sectarians. Travelling east, he reached the Ganges and following its down - ward course, passed several towns where he noted the rising tide of Brahmanism . He visited Sankasia and saw the shrines associ - ated with the Buddha’s descent from Heaven. Next he went to Kanauj also known as Kanyakubja , i.e., “city of the hump-backed women”, which King Harsha Vardhana had made his capital. He did not meet the king, who was away, but who later became his friend and patron. From Kanauj, he went to Ayodha or Saketa , where the Mahayanist teacher Vasubhandu composed his sastras or treatises and reaching the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, arrived at Prayag (Allahabad). There were two monasteries with few followers but many Deva temples with great numbers of sectarians. At the confluence of the two rivers, Hsüan Tsang saw hundreds of Hindu devotees drowning themselves in the waters after fasting for seven days, in the belief that this would wash away their sins and lead them to heaven. He went to Kosambi and visited Ghositarama , now an old habitation in ruins, which the rich merchant Ghosita had built for the Buddha to stay in when - ever he was in Kosambi. Moving northwards, the pilgrim travelled to Sravasti and vis - ited Maheth , where he saw the Sudatta stupa marking the site of Anathapindika’s house and beside it the Angulimala stupa . At Saheth , he found Jetavana in ruins and deserted. From Sravasti,"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"3 2 3 3 he went to Kapilavastu , capital of the old Sakyan kingdom; Lumbini , birthplace of the Buddha; Ramagama , which had been waste and desolate for many years; and Kusinara , scene of the Buddha’s Mahaparinibbana . Travelling south 500 li, through a great forest, he reached Varanasi , the sacred city of the Hindus. There were about thirty monasteries with three thousand monks but over a hundred Deva temples with about ten thousand sectar - ians, mostly Siva worshippers. At the Deer Park in Sarnath , he visited a monastery with fifteen hundred monks of the Sammitiya school and paid reverence at the shrines in the vicinity. Following the course of the Ganges eastward to Ghazipur , then north east, he arrived at the city of Vesali . There were several hundred mon - asteries, which were mostly dilapidated with very few monks. The city was in ruins and practically deserted. He saw the Asokan pil - lar with a lion capital on top and beside it, the stupa built by King Asoka. Near the pillar was a pond dug by a band of monkeys for the Buddha’s use and further south was a stupa marking the spot where the monkeys, taking the Buddha’s bowl, climbed a tree and gathered him some honey . Travelling north-west, he passed the Vajjian country and went to Nepal . Then returning to Vesali and crossing the Ganges, he arrived at the country of Magadha . Pataliputta (Patna), capital of the great Mauryan empire during the time of King Asoka, was in decay. There were fifty monasteries with about ten thousand monks, the majority being Mahayanists. In the old city, Hsüan Tsang saw hundreds of monasteries, Deva temples and stupas lying in ruins. He also visited Kukkutarama monastery built by Asoka, but the building had long been in ruins and only the foundation walls remained. Travelling south, he passed the Tiladaka vihara where learned men and scholars from different countries came to study. Inside one building, he"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"3 2 3 3 saw images of Tara and Avalokitesvara beside an erect image of the Buddha, an indication of the growing influence of Tantrism .

Then he went to Rajagaha where he visited all the sacred shrines, including Vulture Peak , Bamboo Grove , the hot springs , Pippala stone house and Sattapanni caves, venue of the First Buddhist Council . He was in Nalanda around 635 AD and enrolled at the famous Nalanda University , India’s premier Buddhist seat of learning, to fulfill his purpose of coming to India and learn from the wise men about Buddhism. Admission was based on merit in which the gate- keeper, a responsible officer of considerable learning, would ask some difficult questions and the candidate had to answer them to his satisfaction. Normally, out of ten candidates, seven or eight would fail this screening test. Hsüan Tsang, who already had a solid grounding of scholarship, was able to gain admission into the University. Here he studied Yogacara philosophy under the famous Mahayanist teacher Silabhadra . He also studied Hindu philosophy and mastered the Sanskrit language. During his resi - dence in Nalanda, he distinguished himself by his diligence and scholarship. In 638 AD he interrupted his studies and travelled to Champa (Bhagalpur) and West Bengal , ending up at Tamralipti , where he intended to take ship to Sri Lanka and study the Theravada doctrine. There he was told that the island was within easy reach of South India. So he decided to travel by land rather than take the risk of a long sea voyage.

Then continuing the journey through Kosala (the land of Nagarjuna , founder of the Madhyamika doctrine) and Andhra , he reached Amaravati . There were numerous monasteries but they were deserted and ruined. Of those preserved, there were about twenty with a thousand monks of the Mahayana tradition. He saw two establishments situated on two cliffs, one in the east called Purvasaila (East cliff), and the other on the west called Aparasaila (West cliff). Both used to be inhabited by monks but were now deserted and wild. After spend - ing the rainy season of 639 AD in Amaravati, the pilgrim proceed - ed south passing the country of Chola , which he described as “...wild and deserted, a succession of marshes and jungle, with a small population and troops of brigands go through the country openly”. Then, continuing south through a wild forest district and travel - ling 1,500 li, he arrived at the country of Dravida . At the capital Kanchipuram (near Madras), there were about a hundred monasteries with ten thousand Mahayanist monks. Here he learned that Sri Lanka was facing unrest and famine following the death of its ruler. So he gave up the idea of going to the island. Moving northwards, he entered a forest and passed many deserted villages where brigands roamed in search of victims. After travel - ling 2,000 li without incident, the pilgrim arrived at Konkanapura (Golconda near Hyderabad), which had about a hundred mon - asteries with ten thousand monks from both traditions.

According to Hsüan Tsang: “There were about a hundred families who possess a hundred lakhs (millionaires). The rare and valuable products of some distant regions are stored here in great quantities.” He visited a great monastery where two distinguished Mahayana masters, Sthiramati and Gunamati had resided and composed their treatises. Moving west, he passed Surashtra and Gurjjara be - fore arriving at Ujjain , the capital of Avanti . There were scores of monasteries but they were mostly in ruins and only three hundred monks remained. Moving west, he travelled to Sindh where he saw several hundred monasteries occupied by some ten thousand monks of the Sammatiya school. Then moving north and cross - ing the Indus river, he arrived at Multan . Here the believers and monks were few. There were ten monasteries, all in ruins. At this point, he decided to return to Nalanda as he had visited most of the Buddhist shrines in India. Back at Nalanda, Hsüan Tsang devoted his time fully to the study of the Mahayana doctrines and participated in philosophical de - bates. After acquiring an encyclopedic learning, he was looking forward to returning to China and spreading the new learning. The king of Assam , Kumara-raja , heard about the Chinese mas - ter’s ability and invited him to the capital Kamarupa in 643 AD.

At the meeting, both men established a close rela - tionship. Harsha Vardhana invited Hsüan Tsang to his capital at Kanauj where he convoked a religious assembly on the banks of the Ganges, attended by the kings of twenty vassal states, together with monks and Brahmans. Hsüan Tsang was appointed ‘ Lord of the Discussion ’. For the next three weeks, Harsha would offer food to the monks and Brahmans daily. After this, he would carry a life-size golden image of the Buddha on his shoulder up a tall tower, where he paid homage to the Triple Gem with a great of - fering of silken garments decorated with precious stones. On the last day, the heretics tried to sabotage the assembly by setting fire to the tower and attempting to assassinate the king in the result - ing confusion. But the attempt on Harsha’s life was foiled when the culprit was caught by the king himself. He confessed that he was hired by the heretics and Brahmans, who were jealous of the reverence and honour accorded to the Buddhist monks by the king. Thereupon the king punished the ringleader and banished the Brahmans to the frontiers of India. After this, Harsha took his honoured guest to Prayag , where he held the Quinquennial festival in which he gave away all his wealth accumulated over five years, following the example of King Asoka. After witnessing the ceremonies at Prayag, Hsüan Tsang stayed for ten more days with Harsha and then started his return journey to China. To ensure his safe passage to the border, Harsha provided him with a military escort led by Kumara-raja . He returned to China by the opposite direction to which he came to India, by way of Jalandhar , Takkasila and Nagarahara . Then crossing the Hindu Kush , he entered northern Afghanistan.

Devastation and Downfall of Buddhism in India 6, 7, 8, 25, 26 There were two devastations on an extensive scale of Buddhist shrines and monasteries of northern India. The first was by the Ephthalites or White Huns, who invaded India in 500-520 AD and conquered the border provinces of Gandhara and Kashmir. The Hun king, Mihirakula was a barbarian and a sworn enemy of Buddhism, bent on destroying the Buddhist establishment. The Gupta kings fought on and off against the Huns but it was not until 533 AD that Mihirakula was subjugated by Yasodharman of Mandasor. Hsüan Tsang, who passed through Gandhara and Kashmir one hundred years later, heard about the devastation and reported that in Gandhara alone, “Mihirakula overthrew stupas and destroyed monasteries, altogether one thousand and six hundred foundations.” At that age, Buddhism had enough vitality to heal the wounds inflicted by the Huns for over a decade. Sangha life picked up again in new monasteries built over the ruins of the demolished ones. However, in the western part of India, namely: Gandhara, Kashmir and western Uttar Pradesh, Buddhism had lost much ground to the neo-Brahmanism of the Gupta age. In the eastern part, in Magadha (Bihar) and West Bengal, it began to revive again under the Buddhist king, Harsa Vardhana (7 th century AD) and later on, under the patronage of the Pala kings (8 th -12 th century AD). This was a period when the viharas expanded from being centres of monastic training to larger institutions or Mahaviharas dedicated"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"3 8 3 9 to learning and scholarship . These Mahaviharas such as Nalanda , Odantapura and Vikramasila in Magadha had as many as 10,000 students from every Buddhist country. Kings, nobles, wealthy merchants and ordinary people all contributed their share towards the maintenance of these famous universities, but although their financial support made these Buddhist institutions famous and prosperous , yet they undermined the high ideals of renunciation and sacrifice on which the Sangha was founded. Philosophical speculations and logic in the Mahayana tradition to counter the realistic Nyaya position of right knowledge propounded by the Brahmin scholars of Mithila across the Ganges was the chief activ - ity of these Mahayana centres. The monks slowly became accus - tomed to an easy life devoted to academic pursuits and religious rituals and relaxed their moral code to accommodate worldly practices and beliefs. This led to the disintegration of the Order into diverse sects , to a weakening of morality and to correspond - ing erosion of the laity’s faith in the Sangha. During the Pala period of its history from the 9 th -11 th century AD, Buddhism became heavily adulterated by the Tantric cult , with its magic spells, yoga and practices that were completely alien to the earlier form of Buddhism. Prior to this in the Gupta period (c. 300- 550 AD), the Mahayana doctrine had reached the stage whereby Arahantship was openly condemned and Bodhisattaship held up as the goal towards which every good Buddhist should aim. According to the Pali scholar Rhys Davids in his book “The History and Literature of Buddhism”, the whole exposition of this theory was set in the Lotus Sutra or the Saddharma Pundarika as it is called in Sanskrit. It was so subversive of the original Buddhism and even claimed to have been preached by the Buddha himself."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"4 0 4 1 During the Gupta period, more philosophical speculations in the Mahayana tradition emerged and led to the worship of various Mahayanist gods and “ Bodhisattas ” conceived to symbolize the philosophical speculations. According to Rhys Davids, as time went on, converts to the Mahayana who were well acquainted with the Hindu deities of the day, conveniently adopted many Hindu deities into the Buddhist pantheon . These Hindu deities were rep - resented as “ Bodhisattas ” and supporters of the Buddha in order to bring about reconciliation between the two faiths and to attract more devotees. Grand temples were built in honour of these new “ Bodhisattas ”, in which elaborate ceremonies were performed, which attracted peo - ple from all walks of life and encouraged different superstitious beliefs and modes of worship . These practices formed the basis for the development of Tantrayana by Buddhists who adopted the methods of Hindu Tantrists by incorporating Vedic and Hindu beliefs into the religion (refer to Indian Buddhism by Hajime Nakamura). Buddhism was now reduced to an esoteric cult in which spells and magic rites and practices supposedly capable of producing supernatural effects predominated. Tantric mystics were accepted as great leaders who claimed to have discovered the shortest route to Deliverance. In some quarters, it was believed that the “ grace of the teacher ” was sufficient for the realization of the Sublime. Some of these gurus openly ridiculed the monastic code and even propagated mass indulgence in wine and women . The discovery in the ruins of Nalanda of several Tantric images, all of which belonged to the Pala period of its history, provides evidence of the development of Tantrayana at Nalanda University. According to Ven . Jagdish Kashyap (Chapter 1, Path of the Buddha), Buddhism had become so polluted and weakened by"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"4 0 4 1 these perverted forms of practice that it became practically impos - sible to revive after the destruction of the Mahayana temples and monasteries by the Muslim invaders. The fatal blow was dealt around the turn of the 13 th century AD by the Turaskas or Khalijis from Afghanistan . They were fanati - cal Muslims, bent on conquest and destruction. By then, they had conquered the western part of Uttar Pradesh called the Doab , the region bordered by the Yamuna and the Ganges rivers, where they had settled themselves with expansionist aims . Soon they began their invasion, spreading terror and panic through all the towns and countryside in their path, and their advance posed a tremen - dous threat to all monasteries and temples of northern India. The whole doomed area in the east, ancient Magadha (Bihar) and North Bengal , fell to the marauders. Especial ferocity was directed towards Buddhist institutions with huge Buddha and “ Bodhisatta ” images, which were systematically destroyed or vandalised . The shaven-headed monks wearing distinctive monastic robes were easily spotted and massacred wholesale as idolaters. These grue - some killings and destruction are all on historical record. The story of an assault upon the Mahavihara at Odantapura , Bihar in 1198 was told long afterwards, in 1243 by an eye-witness to the Persian historian Minhaz. In his book, Tabaquat-I-Nasiri, he reported as follows (refer to Buddhist Monks and Monasteries of India, Part V, 3, by Sukumar Dutt): “Most of the inhabitants of the place were Brahmanas with shaven heads (monks). They were put to death . Large num - bers of books were found there, and when the Mahammadans saw them, they called for some person to explain the contents. But all of the men were killed. It was discovered that the whole"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"4 2 4 3 fort and city was a place for study (madrasa): in the Hindi language the word Bihar (i.e. Vihara) means a college.” In the destruction of the University of Nalanda , the same histor- ian recorded that thousands of monks were burned alive and yet more thousands beheaded , and the burning of the library contin - ued for several months. The extermination of Buddhist monks dealt a fatal blow to the organization of the Sangha in India. With the monks gone, no one was left to carry on their work or lead the demoralized laity who were forcibly converted to Islam or absorbed into Hinduism and Jainism. Although the latter religions were subjected to the same persecution, their priests and leaders were not easily recognized among their people to be singled out for extermination. So they could survive and rebuild their communities, but for Buddhism in India, it was the end . The high-caste Brahmin priests had always opposed Buddhism because of its criticism of the caste system and while it was under the protection of royal patronage, they had remained silent. After the downfall of Buddhism, they could act without restraint, and began to convert Buddhist tem - ples that had escaped destruction into Hindu temples . In parts of India far from the invaders’ control, the caste system regained its dominance and under community pressures , the demoralized Buddhist laity were slowly absorbed into Hinduism. According to Ven. Bhikkhu Jagdish Kashyap, the three factors discussed earlier contributed to the downfall of Buddhism in India, namely: • Decay and disintegration of the Sangha. • Extermination of the Sangha by external invaders. • Internal opposition from the Hindu caste system."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"4 2 4 3 Yet a handful of survivors were left in the aftermath of the Holocaust . They dispersed and fled with their cherished treasures of holy scriptures to remote, secluded monasteries far from the in - vader’s track or to the nearest port to take ship and sail to Arakan or Burma for safety. A few of them were later found to be sheltered and settled at the areas of Chittagong and Arakan, the South- eastern corner of Bangladesh , who have been claiming direct lineage with the Buddhists of the glorious past. Most trekked northwards across the Himalayas to seek sanctuary in the more hospitable countries of Nepal and Tibet . Thus came the final dispersal of the Buddhist Sangha in India. With the downfall of Buddhism in India, the Buddhist shrines and monuments fell into disuse. They were plundered and destroyed, or just ignored and neglected, and in the course of time fell into ruins and oblivion . This period was the saddest era of Buddhism – and one that must not be forgotten."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"4 4 4 5 7. Restoration of Buddhist Sites in India 13, 16 The disappearance of Buddhism in India lasted six centuries, from the 13 th -19 th century AD. According to Ven. Bhikkhu Jagdish Kashyap, it was almost so complete that even in recent times, the local people of Patna, Rajgir and Muttra, once the strongholds of Buddhism, could not even recognize the Buddhist relics that were discovered there. While in many places, the Buddha statues that were not destroyed came to be worshipped as Hindu deities . The coming of the British in the 19 th century into India saw the excavation of many ancient Buddhist sites which had lain buried during those lost centuries. The person who played the prime role was Sir Alexander Cunningham (1814-1893), the first Director General of Archeology and the pioneer explorer of Buddhist heri- tage in India. A man of military discipline, he became associated with archeology when he undertook excavation of the Dhamek stupa in Sarnath around 1840. He had an innate concern for ancient remains, and was deeply disturbed by the way the monu - ments were suffering from vandalism and the ravages of nature . When Cunningham was appointed the Archeological Surveyor of Indian Archeology in 1861 to lead a scheme for the survey of Northern India , he had a well-formulated plan of following the travel records of the famous Chinese pilgrims Fa Hsien and Hsüan Tsang. These records have proven to be of immense help in locating many of the ancient Buddhist sites such as Kusinara , Sankasia , Savatthi , Nalanda , Kosambi and many others that had become obscured with time. While Cunningham was dedicated to the restoration of Buddhist heritage sites, another person who dedicated his life to reclaiming them for the Buddhists was Anagarika Dharmapala (1865-1933),"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"4 4 4 5 pioneer of the Buddhist revival-movement in India. Born in Sri Lanka by the name of David Hewavitarana, he later took the name of Anagarika Dharmapala , which means “Homeless Guardian of the Dhamma”. Dharmapala came to Bodhgaya in 1891 after reading several articles written by Sir Edwin Arnold, author of the “Light of Asia”, describing the deplorable condition of the Maha Bodhi Temple , the most sacred place of worship of Buddhists. What he saw shocked and saddened him so deeply that he vowed to devote his whole life “... to make this sacred spot to be cared for by our own bhikkhus ”. Realizing that it would not be an easy task to accomplish unless the message of the Buddha spread, he founded the Maha Bodhi Society of India to spearhead the movement. With the Maha Bodhi Society started the process of revival and regeneration of Buddhism, which had nearly become extinct in the country of its origin. Starting at Bodhgaya , where the battle to regain control of the Mahabodhi Temple began, the Maha Bodhi Society ex - panded its activities to Sarnath , venue of the First Sermon . When Anagarika Dharmapala came to India in 1891, Sarnath had been reduced to a tiny village surrounded by jungle, which was the grazing ground of wild pigs. Dharmapala decided to restore it into a living shrine , by building a new vihara beside the famous Deer Park . With the completion of the Mulagandha Kuti Vihara in 1931, and the subsequent establishment of the Maha Bodhi Society Library, Free Clinic, Primary and High School, Teachers Training College, Hostel for pilgrims and a sangharama, Sarnath is once again pulsating with life. The impact of the expanding activities of the Maha Bodhi Society was soon felt throughout India, and led to the Buddhist revival movement in major cities in India. With its headquarters in Calcutta , the Maha Bodhi Society has expand -"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"4 6 4 7 ed its activities to many cities in India, as well as overseas in Japan , Korea , Hong Kong , Sri Lanka , England and the USA . Gradually, all the eight great places of pilgrimage were restored and developed as religious-cum-tourist resorts . Most of them have re - gained much of their lost glory and are pulsating with life, thanks to the concerted efforts of the Sangha, archeologists, historians and lay devotees in their restoration. In particular, the Burmese and Sri Lankan Buddhists have played a crucial role by building viharas to accommodate the Sangha, so that the bhikkhus can act as custodians of the holy shrines and enhance the sanctity of the environment. Many of the shrines are located in rural areas that lack basic amenities, and the monks there play a useful role in pro - moting the education and welfare of the local population. Once again, they are living shrines, worthy of worship and veneration to which thousands of devotees come every year from all over the world to pay homage to the Greatest Teacher ( Sattha) the world has ever known, the Lord Buddha , and earn merit by this pil - grimage of piety and faith. A visit to these repositories of glorious Buddhist heritage will certainly uplift the mind and enable one to develop many good qualities. The sight of fellow pilgrims, who come from far and wide with the common aim of honoring the Blessed One, will surely arouse appreciative joy ( mudita ) in one’s heart.

Lumbini, Birthplace of the Buddha a) How to reach there Lumbini is located in Nepal, near the Indian border town of Sonauli . Nowadays one can apply for a Nepalese visa in Kuala Lumpur in order to enter the country. From the border, a good road leads to Lumbini, about 20 km away. All distances are approximate. b) Religious Significance 1, 2, 4 After fulfilling the practice of the Ten Perfections ( Paramis ) for four incalculables ( asankheyya ) and a hundred thousand world cycles ( kappa ) , the Bodhisatta or Future Gotama Buddha took concep - tion in the womb of Maya Devi , the queen of Suddhodana , chief of a small Sakyan republic, just across the present Indo-Nepalese border. On the full-moon day of May in 623 BC , Maya Devi was travelling in state from the Sakyan capital of Kapilavatthu , to Devadaha , her parents’ home, to deliver her first child in keep - ing with the ancient tradition of her people. Along the way she passed through Lumbini Garden , a pleasure grove of Sala trees which were then in full bloom. Stopping to admire the flowering trees and plants, she began to feel the pangs of childbirth. Quickly she summoned her female attendants to put up a curtain around her. Holding the branch of a Sala tree to support herself, she gave birth to the Bodhisatta while standing up. According to Majjhima Sutta No . 123 , as soon as the Bodhisatta was born, he took seven steps to the North and declared his position in the world with these words:"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"6 8 6 9 Aggo ’ ham asmi lokassa – I am the chief in the world. Jetto ’ ham asmi lokassa – I am the highest in the world. Setto ’ ham asmi lokassa – I am the noblest in the world. Ayam antima jati – This is my last birth. Natthi dani punabbhavo – There is no more becoming for me. As soon as the Bodhisatta was born, a great immeasurable light sur - passing the radiance of the gods appeared, penetrating even those abysmal world inter-spaces of darkness where the sun and moon cannot make their light prevail. The ten thousand-fold world system shook, quaked and trembled and there too a great immeas - urable light appeared to herald the birth of the Bodhisatta. c) Historical Background 6, 9 In 249 BC , the great Mauryan emperor Asoka , who ruled nearly the whole of India from 273 to 236 BC, visited Lumbini as part of his pilgrimage to the sacred Buddhist places and worshipped in person the sacred spot where the Buddha was born. To commem - orate his visit, he built a stone pillar , which bears an inscription in Brahmi script to record the event for posterity. The inscription engraved on the pillar in five lines reads ( translation ): “Twenty years after his coronation, King Piyadassi, Beloved of the Gods, visited this spot in person and worshipped at this place because here Buddha Sakyamuni was born. He caused to make a stone (capital) representing a horse and he caused this stone pillar to be erected. Because the Buddha was born here, he made the village of Lumbini free from taxes and subject to pay only one-eighth of the produce as land revenue instead of the usual rate.”"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"7 0 7 1 (Note: The coronation of Asoka took place in 269 BC , four years after his reign.) After the devastation of Buddhist shrines in India by the Muslims in the 13 th century AD, Lumbini was deserted and eventually en - gulfed by the tarsi forests. In 1896, the German archeologist Dr . Alois A . Fuhrer , while wandering in the Nepalese tarai in search of the legendary site, came across a stone pillar and ascertained beyond doubt it was indeed the birthplace of the Lord Buddha. The Lumbini pillar (also known as the Rummindei pillar) stands today majestically proclaiming that here the Buddha was born . d) Objects of interest 9, 14, 15 (i) Asokan Pillar Upon entering Lumbini Garden, the most visible landmark is a tall pillar surrounded by an iron fence. This is the famous Lumbini Pillar erected by King Asoka in 249 BC. Originally it had a horse capital on top but afterwards it was struck by lightning and broken in the middle leaving 6.7 m standing without the horse capital. It is this pillar with its inscription that confirmed this site as the Buddha’s birthplace. (ii) Sanctum Sanctorum: Holiest of the Holy Spots The area just in front of the Asokan column was formerly the site of the old Maya Devi shrine, which was dismantled around 1995 for archeological excavations. On 4 th February 1996, a team of UN-sponsored archeologists announced the discovery of the Buddha’s birthplace beneath the temple’s foundation.

(iii) New Maya Devi Shrine Nearby is the new Maya Devi shrine, a small pagoda-like struc - ture, which holds a stone sculpture depicting the Nativity of the Buddha . The sculpture contains a bas-relief image of Maya Devi, mother of the Lord, holding a branch of the Sala tree with the newborn infant standing on a lotus pedestal. It was previously in - stalled in the old Maya Devi temple. (iv) Puskarni – the sacred pond South of the Asokan pillar is the famous sacred pond – Puskarni , believed to be the same pond in which Maya Devi washed herself before giving birth to the Bodhisatta . (v) Myanmar, Nepalese, Tibetan Viharas & Meditation Centre The Nepalese Vihara is built inside Lumbini Garden. It is a Theravada monastery run by an old Nepalese bhikkhu. The Tibetan and Myanmar viharas and the Panditarama Meditation Centre are farther away, outside the garden complex. Pilgrims are advised to visit these places to pay their respects to the Sangha, whose presence has sanctified the environment of Lumbini."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"7 2 7 3 (vi) Kapilavatthu, the Sakyan Capital Located some 27 km west of Lumbini, lie the ruins of the ancient Sakyan city of Kapilavatthu . The site has been identified with the archeological mound at Tilaura Kot (kotmound, fortified area). Excavations of these ruins by the Nepalese Archeology Department have exposed mounds of old stupas and monasteries, made of kiln- burnt bricks and clay-mortar. The remains are surrounded by a moat and the walls of the city are made of bricks. The fortified area of the site is 518 m running north-south and 396 m from east to west, roughly 20.5 hectares. On the basis of the archeological findings, the outer city of common citizens is very extensive and fits the reported size of Kapilavatthu as narrated by Hsüan Tsang in the Si-yü-ki. Pilgrims visiting Lumbini should spend an extra day to visit Tilaura Kot where they can still see the site of the Eastern Gate , called the Mahabhinikkhamanam Dvara (Great Renunciation Gate). It was from here that the Bodhisatta set out on his quest for Enlightenment on the night of the full-moon of Asalha (July) in 594 BC when he was twenty-nine years old. In the vicinity of Tilaurakot, there are several Buddhist sites of significance, notably: (vii) Niglihawa, Birthplace of Kanakamuni Buddha Niglihawa, 3 km north-east of Tilaura Kot, is believed to be the ancient town of Sobhavati , birthplace of Kanakamuni Buddha . At the time of his birth, a heavy shower of gold fell over the whole of Jambudipa. Taking this “coming down of gold” as an omen, he was named Kanakagamana ( kanaka = gold, agamana = coming). Over time, the original name Kanakagamana has taken the cor - rupt form of Konagamana . Emperor Asoka visited this place in 249 BC during his pilgrimage and erected a pillar to commemorate"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"7 2 7 3 the event. Today, the Asokan pillar can still be seen but it is bro - ken into two pieces . The upper portion is 4.6 m long while nearly 1.5 m of the lower portion stands above ground slightly tilted. The inscription in Brahmi script on the pillar reads: “King Piyadassi, Beloved of Gods, having been crowned king fourteen years, increased the stupa of Buddha Kanakamuni to double its original size. Twenty years after his coronation, he came himself and worshipped it.” ( translation ) (viii) Gotihawa, Birthplace of Kakusandha Buddha Gotihawa, 7 km south-west of Tilaura Kot, is believed to be the ancient city of Khemavati, the birthplace of Kakusandha Buddha . Emperor Asoka visited it too at the same time and erected a pillar to record his visit. The pillar is broken and only the lower portion of about 3 m still stands in situ, but below ground level. Both the Asokan pillars described here were mentioned by Hsüan Tsang in the Si-yü-ki when he visited Kapilavatthu in 637 AD. At that time, each had a lion-head capital at the top. (ix) Kudan, Site of Nigrodharama (Banyan Grove) At Kudan is a site, which scholars believe to be the Nigrodharama or Banyan Grove, which King Suddhodana offered to the Buddha when he visited Kapilavastu. It was here that Ven. Rahula was ordained when he came to ask for his inheritance from the Buddha.

Bodhgaya, Place of the Buddha’s Enlightenment a) How to reach there Bodhgaya is located in Bihar state, 105 km by road south of Patna or 230 km by road east of Varanasi. All distances are approximate. b) Religious Significance 1, 2, 4 After the Great Renunciation, the Bodhisatta approached two ascetics named Alara Kalama and Udakka Ramaputta who taught him to attain the Formless Jhanas. Although they were the highest attainments at that time, still he was dissatisfied because they did not lead to Nibbana . Leaving them, he arrived at an isolated cave on a hill now known as Dhongra hill, where he underwent painful and profitless practices for six years until his body became skeleton- like and he nearly died. Realizing the futility of self-mortification , he adopted the Middle Path and started eating again to regain his strength. His five companions, thinking that he had given up the struggle and reverted to luxury, left him. The Bodhisatta was now alone in his struggle. One day on the eve of Wesak, while wait - ing to go on alms-round under a Banyan tree, the Bodhisatta was offered milk rice in a golden dish by the Lady Sujata , daughter of the chieftain of the nearby village of Senanigama . After the meal, the Bodhisatta took the dish and went to the Neranjara river, and saying: “If I am to succeed in becoming a Buddha today, let this dish go upstream; but if not, let it go downstream”, he threw it into the water. There it floated to the middle of the river and raced up - stream for eighty cubits (37 m) before it sank in a whirlpool."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"7 4 7 5 In the evening, on the way to the Bodhi tree , the Bodhisatta was offered eight handfuls of grass by the grass-cutter Sotthiya , which he placed on his seat under the Bodhi tree. Sitting cross-legged facing the east , the Bodhisatta made a resolution, saying: “ Let my skin, sinews and bones become dry. Let my flesh and blood dry up. Never from this seat will I stir until I have attained Buddhahood .” This was the culmination of his Perfections developed over count - less aeons, that no being, not even Mara and his dreaded army, could unseat the Bodhisatta from the Aparajita throne. When challenged by Mara, the Bodhisatta called upon the earth to bear witness to his Thirty Perfections , by touching the ground with his right hand. Instantly, the earth responded with a great quake that shook and scattered Mara and his forces until they fled in defeat. Before the sun had set, the Bodhisatta had vanquished Mara and his forces. Then with mind tranquilized and purified, in the first watch of night, he developed the Knowledge of Past Lives; in the middle watch, the Divine Eye; and in the last watch, he developed the Knowledge of Destruction of Taints and attained Supreme Enlightenment . A Supreme Buddha ( Samma-sambuddho ) had arisen in the world on the full moon day of Wesak in 588 BC . c) Historical Background 6, 9 Bodhgaya , the scene of the Buddha’s Supreme Enlightenment, is the most hallowed place on earth to Buddhists. During the Buddha’s time, this place by the banks of the river Neranjara was known as Uruvela . King Asoka was the first to build a temple at this sacred spot. A portrayal of the Asokan temple and other buildings at Bodhgaya has been found in a bas-relief on the Bharhut Stupa in Madhya Pradesh. Beginning with Asoka’s first visit in 259 BC, countless pilgrims have gravitated to this cradle of"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"7 6 7 7 Buddhism without intermission for more than 1,500 years. The devastation of Buddhist viharas and shrines by Muslim hordes in the 13 th century abruptly halted the flow of pilgrims to Bodhgaya. Dharmasvamin , a Tibetan pilgrim, visited Bodhgaya in 1234 AD. He found the place deserted and wrote: “ Only four monks were found staying (in the vihara). One said, ‘It is not good. All have fled in fear of the Turushka soldiery.’ They blocked up the door in front of the Mahabodhi image with bricks and plastered it. Near it they placed another im - age as a substitute .” When Buddhism declined in India, the Burmese came to the res - cue of the decaying Mahabodhi Temple by undertaking repairs during the 14 th and 15 th centuries. Thereafter, Bodhgaya was for - gotten by the Buddhists and the Great Temple fell into ruins. A wandering Hindu ascetic , Mahant Gosain Giri, taking advantage of the situation, established his Math at Bodhgaya and took control of the Temple and environments in 1590 AD . Thereafter, the holy Buddhist shrine passed into the hands of successive Mahants who used the place for sacrilegious practices . In 1861, Cunningham found the Mahant and his followers indulging in all sorts of non-Buddhist ceremonies at the main shrine. Sir Edwin Arnold , author of the Light of Asia visited the Mahabodhi Temple in 1885 and reported this observation in the Daily Telegraph in London: “The Buddhist world had, indeed, well-nigh forgotten this hal - lowed and most interesting centre of their faith – the Mecca, the Jerusalem, of a million Oriental congregations when I sojourned in Buddhagaya a few years ago. I was so grieved to see Maharatta peasants performing ‘Sharaddh (or Shrada)’"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"7 6 7 7 in such a place, and thousands of precious ancient relics of carved stone inscribed with Sanskrit lying in piles around.” Note: Shrada is a Hindu last rite, in which mantras and verses are chanted on behalf of the dead, in the belief that this will free the soul from its earthly existence, and allow it to be reborn in heaven. d) Anagarika Dharmapala and the Maha Bodhi Society 6, 16 The battle to regain control of the Mahabodhi Temple by Buddhists began in January 22, 1891 when Anagarika Dharmapala visited Bodhgaya. Visibly moved by the neglect and sacrilege of this most sacred shrine, he took the vow, “ I will work on to make this sacred spot to be cared for by our own Bhikkhus .” As a first step, he founded the Maha Bodhi Society of Buddhagaya on May 31, 1891 to gar - ner support for this noble objective. Next, he invited four Buddhist monks from Sri Lanka to come and stay at Bodhgaya, namely: Ven. Chandajoti , Ven. Sumangala , Ven. Pemmananda and Ven. Sudassana . They arrived at Bodhgaya in July 1891 and took up residence in the Burmese Rest House. As the Mahant had prop - erty rights to the land in Bodhgaya, he objected to their presence and in February 1893, two of the monks were severely beaten up by his men. Two years later in 1895, when Anagarika Dharmapala attempted to install a Buddha image presented to him by the peo - ple of Japan on the upper floor of the Temple, he was assaulted and prevented from doing so by the Mahant’s men. So the image was kept in the Burmese Rest House. Still the Mahant and some Hindu organizations were not satisfied and tried to get the image removed from the Rest House but the Government did not yield."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"7 8 7 9 In 1906, the Mahant filed a suit seeking to eject the Buddhist monks from the Rest House. Thereafter a long legal battle en - sued between the Mahant and the Buddhists which continued till 1949, when the State of Bihar enacted the Buddha Gaya Temple Management Act which effectively transferred control of the Temple land and other property to a Management Committee . Two things in the Bill were objectionable; one was that the nine- man Management Committee of the Temple would have a Hindu majority , and the other that Buddhist members should be of Indian nationality. In spite of protests by the Maha Bodhi Society, the Bill was passed with an amendment for provision of an Advisory Board in which the majority should be Buddhists and not neces - sarily all of Indian nationality. This means that Buddhists can only advise on the management of the Mahabodhi Temple but the control and final say belong to the Hindus ! To the Maha Bodhi Society, there is no justification for the Mahabodhi Temple to be controlled by non-Buddhists just as if a Muslim mosque, a Christian church, a Sikh gurdwara or a Hindu temple were to be controlled by persons of different faiths. In his article entitled The Vow Still Remains in Sambodhi, 1996, the late Ven . Pannarama Mahathera , Bhikkhu-in-charge of Buddhagaya Maha Bodhi Society, revealed the irony that even the Advisory Board , which was supposed to be controlled by Buddhists, has only 11 Buddhist members but 14 non-Buddhist members! It is time that these non-Buddhist members were replaced by rep - resentatives from Buddhist organizations which are really con - cerned about the development of Bodhgaya , the place of Buddha’s Enlightenment. Thus, Dharmapala’s vow is not fulfilled and it still remains."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"7 8 7 9 e) Objects of Interest 4, 9, 17, 18, 19 (i) Mahabodhi Temple The Mahabodhi Temple has a long history. Excavations by Cunningham in 1872 suggested three periods in its construction. The first phase of construction by King Asoka during the 3 rd cen - tury BC was the Bodhi Shrine , represented in the bas-relief on the 2 nd century BC Bharhut Stupa. The second phase of construction during the 1 st century AD involved renovation of the original Bodhi Shrine by two pious ladies, Surangi and Nagadevi , wives of Sunga kings. The third phase of construction was undertaken by Huviska , the Kusana king of the 2 nd century AD. The images of the Buddha originated during this period. Therefore shrines were erected for their installation. Cunningham suggested that the entire Mahabodhi Temple, as seen today, was mainly the struc - ture of the Huviska period (111-138 AD). As it was built over the remains of Asoka’s shrine, the Vajrasana Throne retains its origi - nal position of the Seat of Enlightenment. In the 7 th century AD, renovations were carried out which included placing a new basalt slab over the older plaster throne at the Vajrasana. In the late 19 th century, massive renovations were carried out under the able super- vision of Cunningham , Beglar and R . L . Mitra to restore the Maha Bodhi Temple, which had fallen into ruins after centuries of vandalism and neglect by its squatter-occupants, the Mahants. The magnificent building we see today is the result of their rare devotion and dedication . The Mahabodhi Temple is undoubtedly the most exquisite- looking building in Bodhgaya. Standing 52 m high with a base of 15.2 sq. m, it consists of a straight pyramidal tower surmounted by a stupa. At the corners of the base, there arise four smaller towers"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"8 0 8 1 – miniature replicas of the main spire. The main door faces east and in front of it there is an imposing ancient gateway decorated with carvings. The niches on the walls of both sides of the Temple contain images of the Buddha. The main shrine hall or Sanctum on the ground floor is reached after passing through a vaulted passage , on both sides of which are stone staircases leading up to a smaller shrine hall on the first floor. On entering the Sanctum, one comes face to face with the great gilded image of the Buddha seated in the earth-touching-posture ( bhumi phassa-mudra) . Just gazing at this magnificent image of our Lord will certainly evoke feelings of joy and reverence in the heart of the pilgrim! This is the result of the faith and devotion in heeding the Buddha’s exhortation to “ visit the holy places and look upon them with feelings of reverence ”. The colossal gilded image is from the 10 th century AD . Here the Buddha is depicted as sitting on a patterned cushion instead of a lotus. It is supported by a pedestal decorated with figures of lions alternating with elephants. The patterned cushion is a common feature found in other Buddha images from Eastern India, which was probably copied from this image. Most people are not aware of the fact that this image was not in the temple when archeologi - cal explorations were going on in and around Buddhagaya by the then British government. According to an article on Buddhagaya Sculptures in the Sambodhi, 1993, R. L. Mitra noted that it was in the Mahant’s compound . Later on, at the request of Cunningham and Beglar , it was moved to its present location at the main shrine. If not for the timely intervention of these two gentlemen, this in - spiring image would still be wasting in the Mahant’s compound instead of its present rightful place for pilgrims to worship!"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"8 0 8 1 (ii) Bodhi Tree (Bodhidruma) The Bodhi tree under which the Buddha attained Supreme Enlightenment is situated behind the Temple. It is a Pipal tree ( Ficus religiosa ) , also known in Pali as assattha. It is said to have sprung up at the same time when the Buddha was born, i.e., his co-natal ( sahajata ) . According to the commentaries, different Buddhas attained Enlightenment seated under different trees of their choice and each of them became the ‘ Bodhi tree’ of the par - ticular Buddha during his dispensation. In the present dispensa - tion, only the Bodhi tree of Gotama Buddha is reverenced. The site of the Bodhi tree is the same for all Buddhas. It is believed that no place on earth can support the weight of the Buddha’s Enlightenment. The ground is so firm that it remained unmoved , even as a violent earthquake shook the world and scattered Mara and his army, who had come to challenge the Bodhisatta for the Seat of Enlightenment. Even Sakka Devaraja is unable to travel in the air immediately above it. Such is the charismatic power of the place called “ Navel of the Earth ”. From earliest times, kings and commoners have come here to honor it. Being the object of veneration of Buddhists, it naturally became the target of destruction by the enemies of Buddhism. According to Hsüan Tsang, the Bodhi tree was first cut down by Asoka before his conversion, but later out of remorse, he revived the tree by bathing the roots with scented water and milk. Asoka paid homage to the tree so earnestly that his queen, Tissarakkha , was filled with jealousy and had it destroyed secretly. Again, it was revived by Asoka as before. Thereafter, he built a wall over 3 m high to surround it for protection.. After the fall of the Mauryan empire in the 2 nd century BC, the Sunga king Pusyamitra , who was a persecutor of Buddhism, also destroyed the Bodhi tree but"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"8 2 8 3 a sapling of the tree from Sri Lanka was brought back and re - planted in the same spot. During the 6 th century AD Sasanka , a Hindu king, cut down the Bodhi tree, but sometime later it was replanted with a sapling from the Bodhi tree in Sri Lanka by King Purvavarma of Magadha, who then built a wall 7.3 m high to sur - round it. Its remains were 6.1 m high when Hsüan Tsang visited it. In 1876, the old decaying Bodhi tree fell down during a storm and a sapling from it was planted on the same spot by Cunningham . The present Bodhi tree is now 125 years old. (iii) Vajrasana or Diamond Throne The Vajrasana is located between the Bodhi tree and the Temple. It marks the actual spot where the Buddha attained Supreme Enlightenment. It is now marked by a red sandstone slab 2.3 m long by 1.3 m wide by 0.9 m high. Pilgrims who visit this spot should spend some time in this conducive environment to reflect on the virtues of the Buddha to attain fullness of faith and calm followed by mindfulness meditation to develop insight. (iv) The Buddha’s Stay at Seven Places after Enlightenment After attaining Buddhahood on the full-moon night of Wesak, as dawn broke the Buddha uttered a paean of joy ( udana ) . While sitting on the Vajrasana he decided to continue sitting on the un - defeated throne, on which he overcame Mara and fulfilled all his wishes, including the one to become a Buddha. • First Week on the Throne (Pallanka Sattaha) The Buddha sat on the Diamond Throne for seven days in medita - tion absorbed in the bliss of emancipation ( Arahantship Fruition). At the end of seven days, he emerged from the absorption and"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"8 2 8 3 contemplated on the Doctrine of Dependent Origination ( Paticca Samuppada ) the whole night. • Second Week of the Gaze (Animisa Sattaha) Throughout the second week, as a mark of gratitude to the Bodhi Tree for providing him shelter, the Buddha stood gazing at it with - out closing his eyes . On the spot where the Buddha stood, a shrine was erected by King Asoka. This shrine, named the Animisilocana Cetiya , is located on elevated ground within the courtyard in front of the Temple. • Third Week on the Walk (Cankama Sattaha) The third week was spent on walking meditation along a ‘jewelled promenade or Cankama ’ running from east to west between the Diamond throne and the Animisilocana Cetiya. • Fourth Week in Jewelled House (Ratanaghara Sattaha) The Buddha spent the fourth week in the ‘Jewelled House’, re - flecting on the Abhidhamma , which deals with absolute truths concerning mental and material processes. As he contemplated on the deep and profound doctrine of the Patthana or Conditional Relations , there arose great rapture in the Omniscient mind, which activated material processes in the body to emit rays of six colours – blue, gold, white, red, pink and a massive brightness of all these assorted colours. This spot is now marked by a small shrine within the compound to the north of the Cankama. • Fifth Week at Ajapala Nigrodha Tree (Ajapala Sattaha) During the fifth week, the Buddha sat at the root of the Ajapala Banyan tree reflecting on the Dhamma and absorbed in the bliss of Phalasamapatti (Fruition of Arahantship ) . This Banyan tree was"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"8 4 8 5 called Ajapala because goatherds came for shelter under its shade. Here the Buddha declared the qualities of a true Brahman in reply to a question by a conceited brahmin. This site is indicated by a signboard within the courtyard, directly in front of the Temple. • Sixth Week at Mucalinda (Mucalinda Sattaha) After seven days at the Ajapala Banyan tree, the Buddha moved to the Mucalinda ( Barringtonia acutangula ) tree, a short distance south of the Temple. There he sat for seven days at the root of the Mucalinda tree, absorbed in the bliss of Arahantship. At that time, there arose an untimely rainstorm and gloom for seven days. Mucalinda, serpent king of the lake, came out and used its coils to encircle the Buddha’s body and its hood to cover the Buddha’s head, thereby protecting the Lord. The site of this episode is at the Mucalinda pond, a short distance south of the Temple. • Seventh Week at Rajayatana Tree (Rajayatana Sattaha) After seven days at the Mucalinda tree, the Buddha moved to the Rajayatana tree ( Buchanania latifolia ) near the Temple. Here he sat at the foot of the tree absorbed in the bliss of Arahantship for seven days. At that time, two merchant brothers, Tapussa and Bhallika , from Ukkala in Myanmar met the Buddha and offered him rice cakes and honey. They became the first lay disciples and asked the Buddha for an object of worship. Thereupon the Buddha rubbed his head and presented them with eight hairs . The brothers returned to their native Myanmar with the precious hair relics, which were later enshrined by the king in Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon. The site of this episode is marked by a sign - board just south of the Temple."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"8 4 8 5 (v) Sujata Kuti Prior to enlightenment, the Bodhisatta was staying on the other side of the Neranjara river in a cave now known as Dungeswari . This cave is on a hill, now known as the Dhongra hill, about an hour’s journey from Bodhgaya. After undergoing painful and profitless practices for six years, he decided to adopt the Middle Path and moved to the Uruvela forest near the village of Senanigama , where one can still see the site of Lady Sujata’s house , which is now on a small mound. In that village too, one can visit a small shrine under a Banyan tree, with images portraying Sujata’s offering of milk rice to the Bodhisatta on the eve of his Enlightenment (vi) Uruvela Forest The area, which was once a forest, is now a wooded area near the Sujata Shrine. Here one can find an old building with a dry well in the centre. This site is believed to be the fire-chamber of the Kassapa brothers , three matted hair Jatilas, who had a follow - ing of one thousand disciples . Here the Buiddha tamed the ser - pent, which inhabited the fire chamber. The taming of the elder Kassapa brother Uruvela took a longer time. The Buddha had to employ his psychic powers to convert the misguided Jatila. After Uruvela Kassapa became the Buddha’s disciple, his brothers, Nadi and Gaya , followed suit together with their followers. After hear - ing the Fire Sermon preached by the Buddha, the thousand newly ordained bhikkhus became Arahants . (vii) Temples and Monasteries in Bodhgaya Bodhgaya is the fountainhead of Buddhism.

Sarnath, Place of the Buddha’s First Sermon a) How to reach there Sarnath is located in the state of Uttar Pradesh, 30 km from the city of Varanasi (Benares). From Bodhgaya, the distance is 250 km. All distances are approximate. b) Religious Significance 1, 2, 4 After spending seven weeks at the seven places in Bodhgaya fol - lowing his Enlightenment, the Buddha decided to teach the Dhamma he had realized to the Five Ascetics, namely: Kondanna , Vappa , Bhaddiya , Mahanama and Assaji , who had served him for six years, but left after he abandoned the path of self-mortifica - tion. He arrived at Deer Park or Isipatana in modern day Sarnath on the full-moon day of Asalha , exactly two months after Wesak . When they saw the Buddha coming in the distance they decided not to welcome him, but as soon as the Buddha approached they found themselves unable to keep their pact and began to serve him. The Buddha was able to convince them of his Attainment. That very night, the Buddha delivered the historic First Sermon , the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta or Discourse on Turning the Wheel of Dhamma , which led to Kondanna attaining the first stage of sainthood at the end of the discourse. The remain - ing four ascetics attained the first stage of sainthood successively over the next four days. Later, the Buddha preached to them the Anattalakkhana Sutta or Discourse on the Characteristics of Non- Self, hearing which they attained Arahantship or final sainthood ."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"8 8 8 9 In Sarnath too, the Buddha converted the rich man Yasa and his 54 friends , who also became Arahants . Later, the Buddha despatched them in various directions to propagate the Dhamma , with each to go a separate way. Thus Sarnath became famous as the place of the First Sermon , as well as the founding of the Sangha (Monkhood). c) Historical Background 6, 9 King Asoka visited Sarnath in 249 BC and erected several monuments to mark his pilgrimage, notably; the Dhamek stupa, Dharmarajika stupa and the Asokan pillar surmounted by the famous Lion Capital , which is now the crest of India. During the reign of King Kaniska (78 AD), Sarnath was a centre of religious activity and the famous collosal Bodhisatta image with a large parasol, was installed by the bhikkhu Bala of Mathura . During the Gupta period (4 th -6 th century AD), the Dhamek Stupa was en - cased with carved stones, the Mulagandhakuti main shrine was enlarged and the famous Preaching Buddha image, a gift of King Kumaragupta, was added. In 520 AD, Sarnath had its share of destruction during the invasion of the Huns under the barbarian Mihirakula. But after the Huns were defeated, Sarnath again flourished under the Buddhist king, Harsa Vardharna (606-647 AD) and continued to be a living shrine under the Pala kings ( 8 th -12 th century AD). The last known patron of Sarnath was Queen Kumaradevi , the pious Buddhist wife of King Govindachandra of Benares (1114-1154 AD). She built a large monastery at Sarnath named Dhammacakka Jina Vihara , the ruins of which were exposed during excavations in the early 20 th century. Things took a turn for the worse when Muslim hordes overran India and started their trail of destruction. After"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"8 8 8 9 the diaspora of the Sangha in India, Sarnath became deserted and was forgotten for about 600 years. In 1794, Sarnath came to the notice of the world under tragic circumstances . Jagat Singh, a minister in Benares, dismantled the famous Dharmarajika stupa as a convenient way of collecting bricks and stones for building a housing colony. When the stupa was pulled down, workmen found at a depth of 8.3 m, a stone box containing a green marble casket. Inside it were human relics , presumably those of the Buddha , since they were enshrined there by King Asoka. Following Hindu custom, Jagat Singh consigned them into the Ganges River, where they were lost forever . This act of vandalism would have gone unnoticed but for a report about the discovery by Jonathan Duncan , Commissioner of Benares, which appeared in the ‘ Asiatic Researches .’ Soon public attention was attracted to the ruins of Sarnath and in 1815, Col . C . Mackenzie began explorations and discovered some sculp - tures, which are now kept at the Calcutta Museum . In 1835-36, Cunningham carried out excavations and recovered over forty sculptures and carved stones. Another tragedy struck when they were carted away in his absence together with sixty cartloads of stones from the shrines as construction material for two bridges and some buildings in Benares. Further excavations were contin - ued on and off from 1851 to 1922, which exposed the Dhamek stupa, the Dharmarajika stupa, Mulagandhakuti shrine, Asokan pillar and the ruins of several monasteries. The first four monu - ments are considered more sacred because of their association with the Buddha. The fifth sacred spot is probably the sunken shrine of Pancayatana , which is believed by some monk teachers to be the site where the Buddha preached the First Sermon."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"9 0 9 1 d) Objects of Interest 6, 9 (i) Chaukhandi This is the first monument to be seen as one enters Sarnath. This mass of brickwork with an octagonal tower on top is what remains of an ancient stupa . The tower was constructed to commemo - rate the visit of Hamuyan, father of Akbar Khan to Sarnath in 1588 AD. This site is believed to be the place where the Buddha stopped to let the Five Ascetics see him and welcome him as he entered the Deer Park. (ii) Deer Park or Isipatana A kilometre north is the famous Migadaya or Deer Park, also called Isipatana or Seer’s Landing. Within its serene grounds are found all the sacred ancient monuments, namely: (iii) Dhamek Stupa This imposing stupa is cylindrical in shape, 28.5 m in basal diam - eter and 43.6 m tall. During the Gupta period, the lower portion was encased in stone, having beautiful carvings all round. The design consists of a broad band of Swastikas worked into different geometrical patterns, with a chiselled lotus wreath running above and below the Swastikas. While boring a shaft in the centre of the stupa in search of relics, Cunningham found remains of an earlier stupa of Mauryan bricks. It was probably the stupa raised by Asoka when he visited Sarnath. No bodily relics were found inside this stupa, but a slab with Buddha’s creed, ‘ ye dhamma hetuppabhava, etc .’ in the characters of the 6 th and 7 th century was discovered. This appears to suggest its close association with the Buddha’s dhamma . According to an inscription of the Pala king Mahipala I (1026 AD), its original name was Dhammacakka stupa . The Archeological"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"9 0 9 1 Survey of India used this finding to support its claim that this spot marks the site of the First Sermon . However, it is not possible to confirm this claim as two other places, namely: Dhammarajika stupa and the Gupta shrine of Pancayatana , are also believed by Burmese monks to be the site of the First Sermon. For the pilgrim, the best thing to do is to treat the whole area as the place of the First Sermon and to be mindful at all the holy shrines. (iv) Dharmarajika Stupa The ruins of the Dharmarajika stupa are a short distance north of the Dhamek stupa, and consists of a circular base of what remained after the wanton act of destruction by Jagat Singh. The original stupa built by King Asoka was 13.4 m in diameter but was enlarged twice during the Gupta period so that the base we see today is larger. The Dhammarajika stupa, as its name indicates, was believed to be built by Asoka to enshrine the bodily relics of the Buddha at the time of his re-distributing the relics from the seven original stupas and enshrining them in a number of other stupas at different places. However, some Burmese monks are of the opinion that the Dhammarajika stupa marks the site of the First Sermon. (v) Mulagandhakuti (Main Shrine) North of the Dhammarajika stupa are the ruins of the Main Shrine, site of the Mulagandhakuti or First Perfumed Chamber where the Buddha spent the first rains-retreat. According to the Dhammapada Commentary, it was donated by the rich man Nandiya and as soon as the Buddha accepted the gift, a celestial mansion arose in Tavatimsa Heaven awaiting its owner, Nandiya.

(vi) Asokan Pillar A short distance to the west of Mulagandhakuti, under a flat roof and enclosed by railings, stands the 2 m high base of the Asokan pillar. The original pillar was 15 m high and surmounted by the famous Lion Capital which can be seen in Sarnath Museum . This pillar is believed to mark the site where the Buddha assembled the Sangha comprising sixty Arahants and exhorted them to go in different directions to spread the Teaching. On the pillar is an inscription, which says: “ Let no one cause a division in the Sangha .” During Asoka’s time, bhikkhus from many sects lived in Sarnath and it is believed that he issued this Sanghabhedaka (Cause a Schism in the Order) Edict to promote harmony among the vari - ous Buddhist sects. (vii) Sunken Shrine of Pancayatana To the east of the Dhammarajika stupa, is a sunken shrine under a concrete platform. It is made of terra cotta bricks and modelled to resemble one of the four square temples of the Gupta period, called “ pancayatana ”. The site of this sunken shrine of Pancayatana is believed by some monk teachers to be the place where the Buddha preached the First Sermon to the five ascetics. Being not as well known as the four main monuments of Sarnath, it has fewer visitors. As a result, it is a quieter and more conducive place for meditation ."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"9 2 9 3 (viii) Mulagandhakuti Vihara About 500 m east of the Dhamek stupa stands the Mulagandhakuti Vihara , built by the Maha Bodhi Society of India in 1931 under the untiring efforts of Anagarika Dharmapala , whose mission was to make all the sacred Buddhist places in India come under the care of the Sangha. On the day of opening, the sacred relics of the Buddha unearthed in Taxila in 1913-14, were presented by the Director General of Archeology, representing the Government, to the Maha Bodhi Society. These Buddha relics were enshrined under the Preaching Buddha image and are taken out every year during Kathina for worship. The beautiful Ajanta style frescoes on both walls of the vihara were painted by a famous Japanese artist, Kosetsu Nosu . He took three years, from 1932-35, to complete the murals. A short distance outside the vihara is a newly constructed shrine with life-size images, depicting the Buddha’s First Sermon to the Five Ascetics. At present, the abbot of Mulagandhakuti Vihara is Ven.

(ix) Sarnath Archeological Museum (Closed on Fridays) The museum houses antiquities recovered from the ruins at Deer Park during excavations from 1905 onwards. Inside the museum, numerous sculptures of the Buddha and Bodhisatta, mostly of the Gupta period (4 th -5 th century AD) are displayed. The four most important sculptures on display are described as follows: • Lion Capital On entering the main hall, one sees the most magnificent sculp - ture of Mauryan art – the Lion Capital , which once crowned the Asokan Pillar at Deer Park. This polished sandstone sculpture"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"9 4 9 5 is 2.3 m tall and consists of four lions sitting back to back on a circular abacus about 0.3 m high. The abacus has four running animals , each separated by a Dhammacakka wheel on its side, namely: Bull representing the Buddha’s birth sign; Elephant rep - resenting his conception as Maya Devi dreamt that an elephant entered her womb; Horse representing the Bodhisatta’s renuncia - tion as he left home on his horse Kanthaka; Lion representing his First Sermon. The four lions that surmount the Capital represent the roar of the Buddha in the four directions. The Lion Capital is the crest of India and the Dhammacakka Wheel is the emblem of its national flag. • Colossal Bodhisatta Image This colossal standing image is of red sandstone donated by the bhikkhu Bala in 81 AD during the reign of King Kaniska and rep - resents the best tradition of Mathuran art. Behind the statue is a stone shaft, which once supported a beautifully carved umbrella . The stone umbrella can also be seen in the main hall. • Buddha’s Life Panels There is a sculptured panel showing the four principal events, namely: Birth, Enlightenment, First Sermon and Mahaparinibbana of the Lord Buddha. Another panel illustrates the eight events in the life of the Buddha, namely, the four principal events and the four miracles – the great miracle at Sravasti , the descent from Heaven at Sankasya , the taming of the drunken elephant Nalagiri at Rajagaha and the offering of honey to the Buddha by the monkeys at Vesali ."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"9 4 9 5 • Preaching Buddha Image The seated Buddha image in Dhammacakka mudra or Preaching posture is one of the most beautiful creations of Gupta art . This famous sculpture was a gift of King Kumaragupta who ruled from 414-455 AD. The halo around the head is carved with floral designs and has two celestial figures on both upper corners. Inset at the bottom are seven figures , representing the Five Ascetics plus the Queen and her son in kneeling position, paying hom - age to the Dhammacakka wheel. A picture of this sculpture can be seen on the cover of Ven. K. Sri Dhammananda’s book, “The Dhammapada ”. (x) Mahabodhi Society The credit for restoring Sarnath into a living shrine goes to Anagarika Dharmapala , founder of the Maha Bodhi Society of India. He established the Mahabodhi Society in Sarnath, which is located on the left of the Mulagandhakuti Vihara , which it over - sees, in addition to the Mahabodhi schools, college, library and training school for monks and nuns. Lately the Society has con - structed a hospital to cater for the poor patients around Sarnath. (xi) Temples and Monasteries in Sarnath There are several modern temples and monasteries for the pilgrim to visit in Sarnath, namely: the Burmese vihara, Chinese temple, Japanese temple, Korean temple, Thai temple and three Tibetan monasteries. The Burmese monastery is called the Dhammacakka Vihara and was established by Ven . Chandramani of Kushinagar. The present abbot is Ven . U Wannadhaza , a Burmese Sayadaw, who has been in Sarnath for many years. Lately, the vihara has added a new wing to accommodate pilgrims visiting Sarnath."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"9 6 9 7 4. Kusinara, Place of the Buddha’s Passing Away a) How to reach there Kusinara or Kushinagar is in the village of Kasia in the Deoria district of Uttar Pradesh. The nearest town is Gorakhpur , 55 km away. By road, Kushinagar is 130 km south of Lumbini , 250 km east of Sravasti and 250 km north of Patna . All distances are approximate. There are now two good hotels for pilgrims to stay in at Kushinagar. b) Religious Significance 1, 2, 3 Three months before he reached the age of eighty , the Buddha renounced his will to live at the Capala Shrine in Vesali . Travelling in stages via Pava where he ate his last meal , offered by the smith Cunda , he reached the final resting-place at the Sala g rove of the Mallas by the bank of the Hirannavati river in Kushinagar . There, on the full-moon day of Wesak in 543 BC , the Buddha passed into Mahaparinbbana, the passing away into Nibbana wherein the elements of clinging do not arise (i.e. no more rebirth). His last convert was the wandering ascetic Subhadda and his last words to the bhikkhus were: “Handa ‘dani bhikkhave amantayami vo: Vaya-dhamma sankhara. Appamadena sampadetha.” (Translation: “Indeed, bhikkhus , I declare this to you: It is the nature of all conditioned things to perish. Accomplish all your duties with mindfulness.”)"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"9 6 9 7 The Buddha was lying on his right side between two Sala trees with his head to the north when he breathed his last. After his Mahaparinibbana, his body was taken into the town by the north - ern gate and out through the eastern gate to the shrine of the Mallas called the Makutabandhana . They were unable to light the funeral pyre until Ven. Maha Kassapa came and paid his respects. After the cremation, the relics were divided into eight equal portions by the brahmin Dona , who distributed them to eight clans , namely: • King Ajatasattu of Magadha, • the Licchavis of Vesali, • the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu, • the Bulians of Allakappa, • the Koliyans of Ramagama, • the brahman of Vethadipa , • the Mallas of Pava, and • the Mallas of Kushinagar. Dona himself kept the urn used for dividing the relics. When the Moriyas of Pipphalavana arrived, it was too late as all the relics had been distributed, so they took from there the ashes . Returning home, these men raised stupas to honour them. So it came about that there were eight stupas for the relics, a ninth for the urn , and a tenth for the ashes . c) Historical Background 6, 9, 20 In those days, Kushinagar was described by Ven. Ananda as “this little mud-walled town, this back-woods town, this branch township ”. After the Mahaparinibbana of the Buddha, it became an important religious centre as Buddhism spread in India. As one of the four"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"9 8 9 9 pilgrimage places mentioned by the Buddha, it attracted devout Buddhists from all over India and abroad. King Asoka visited Kushinagar in 249 BC and raised several stupas and pillars at the site. But by the time Hsüan Tsang visited Kushinagar in 637 AD, the place was in ruins and its towns and villages waste and des- olate with few inhabitants. He saw the Sala trees under which the Buddha passed into Mahaparinibbana, the vihara containing the Reclining Buddha image and beside it the 61 m tall stupa built by Asoka-raja, in a ruinous state with a stone pillar in front. Further to the north, after crossing the Hirannavati river was a stupa marking the cremation site . Yet Kushinagar continued to be a living shrine until the 12 th century AD, but after the Muslim conquest of India it became deserted and eventually fell into ruins and was forgotten. In 1861-62, Cunningham visited the ruins of Kasia and identified the place as the site of the Buddha’s Mahaparinibbana. In 1876, his assistant Carlleyle carried out extensive excavations, which com - pletely exposed the Main stupa and discovered right at its front the famous Reclining Buddha image buried among the ruins of an oblong shrine. More excavations continued until 1912 and yielded datable finds which showed the continuous occupation of Kushinagar up to the 12 th century AD. In recent times, the first Buddhist to occupy Kushinagar was the Venerable Mahavira , an Indian national who was ordained as a monk in Sri Lanka, in 1890. He was responsible for restor - ing Kushinagar back to its rightful place as a sacred shrine. Ven. Mahavira repaired the main temple and built a vihara and Dhamma hall in 1902-03. After him came the Venerable Chandramani from Akyab township in Arakan, Myanmar, who was ordained as a monk in Chittagong in 1903. He continued the good work of his predecessor by gaining possession of the Mahaparinibbana Temple,"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"9 8 9 9 establishing educational institutions for the local people and reviv - ing the tradition of Buddha Jayanti , which was celebrated for the first time in Kushinagar in 1924. Ven. Chandramani passed away in 1972 and was succeeded by his disciple, Ven. Gyaneshwar , a Myanmar monk who continues the noble task of taking care of the holy site. d) Objects of Interest 9, 20 (i) Mahaparinibbana Temple The present Temple was built by the Indian Government in 1956 as part of the Commemoration of the 2500 th year of Mahaparinibbana or 2500 BE (Buddhist Era). The old temple restored by Carlleyle was too small to accommodate the increasing number of pilgrims visiting it. Inside this temple, one can see the famous Reclining Buddha image lying on its right side with the head to the north . The statue is 6.1 m long and rests on a 7.3 m long stone couch. On the front side of the couch are three sculptures, believed to represent Ven. Ananda near the feet, Ven. Subhadda at the middle and Ven. Dabba Malla at the other corner. At the centre is an inscription of the 5 th century AD, which states the statue was “ a gift of the monk Haribala to the Mahavihara ” and that “ it was fashioned by Dinna ”. This 1,500-year old Reclining Buddha image was executed out of one block of red sandstone brought in from Mathura during the Gupta period. It was Carlleyle who discovered it in 1876 in a dilapidated condition and successfully pieced together the frag - ments found scattered about. This statue bears the 32 marks of the Great Man ( Mahapurisa ) and can evoke different feelings in one’s mind, depending on where one stands to look at it."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"100 101 • In front of the face, one can discern a smiling mood in the face. • Near the middle part of the body, one can discern a mood of suffering . • At the feet , one can discern the calm and serenity in the face. (ii) Mahaparinibbana or Nirvana Stupa This stupa beside the Mahaparinibbana Temple is a restoration of the Main stupa exposed during excavations by Carlleyle in 1876. When examined to a depth of 4.3 m, it revealed a copper plate and other objects from the Gupta period. The inscription on the plate in Sanskrit mentioned that the objects were deposited in the Nirvana stupa by the monk Haribala . Hsüan Tsang, who came in 637 AD, mentioned that the Nirvana stupa was built by Asoka. He also saw in front of it a stone pillar to record the Nirvana of Tathagata but it bore no date. The Nirvana stupa is believed to be erected originally by the Mallas to enshrine the Buddha’s relics and subsequently enlarged by King Asoka and later during the Gupta period . It is likely that the Nirvana stupa was built on the site where the Buddha passed into Mahaparinibbana for devo - tees to worship long before Buddha images came into existence, although another theory puts the Buddha’s Mahaparinibbana at the site of the Reclining Buddha. The Mahaparinibbana stupa was renovated in 1927 with donations of a Myanmar, U Po Kyo , and is 23 m tall. (iii) Matha Kuwara Shrine After eating the last meal offered by the smith Cunda , the Buddha became sick. According to the commentary, although the distance from Pava to Kushinagar was 3 gavutas or about 10 km, it took great effort and the Buddha had to stop at 25 places to rest. Thus comes sickness to a man, crushing all his health. As he wanted to"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"100 101 point out this fact, the Buddha spoke these words which aroused religious urgency ( samvega ) : “ I am wearied and would rest awhile .” At the last place of rest, 400 metres before reaching the Upavanatta Sala grove, the Buddha had to ask Ven. Ananda three times before the latter would go to the nearby stream to fetch him some water to drink. The reason why Ven. Ananda did not go at first was be - cause many carts had crossed the stream, making the water muddy and dirty. After the third request, Ven. Ananda went to the stream and found that its water had turned clear and potable. This place is called Matha Kuwara and a shrine has been erected and installed with a colossal Buddha image in earth-touching- posture ( bhumi-phassa-mudra ) . The 3.05 m tall statue is carved out of one block of blue stone and is about 1,000 years old. The name ‘Matha Kuwara’ literally means ‘forehead prostration’, which is what devotees do when they visit this shrine. The present temple was built in 1927 out of donations of two Myanmar devotees, U Po Kyo and U Po Hlaing . It is located 0.4 km south-west of the Mahaparinibbana Temple. (iv) Cremation Stupa or Makutabandhana Cetiya After paying homage to the body of the Buddha for six days, the Mallas carried it to the Makuta-bandhana , the traditional place for crowning their chieftains, where they cremated it. The crema - tion ceremony is described in Part VI of the Mahaparinibbana Sutta , which also describes the partitioning of the Buddha’s relics by the brahmin Dona. The Cremation stupa was raised by the Mallas some time after the Buddha’s cremation and repaired in the 3 rd century BC by Asoka and again in the 5 th century AD dur - ing King Kumaragupta’s reign. When Cunningham visited the site in 1861-62, it was just a big mound. The hidden stupa was"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"102 103 subsequently exposed to reveal a circular drum 34 m in diameter resting on a 47 m diameter platform. During excavations, a large number of clay seals inscribed with Buddhist verses were discov - ered which confirmed that it was the cremation site . It is about 1 . 6 km east of the Matha Kuwara Shrine along the main road. In recent times, the area around the Cremation stupa has been plant - ed with grass and is well maintained for the benefit of pilgrims. (v) Buddhist Monasteries in Kushinagar In recent times there have been some developments in Kushinagar with the construction of several monasteries and other modern facilities for pilgrims. While in Kushinagar, pilgrims should visit the viharas, namely: Chinese Monastery, Japan-Sri Lanka Buddhist Temple, Myanmar Vihara and Tibetan Monastery, to pay their respects and seek assistance from the monks there to learn more about the holy site."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"102 103 P III F P  M CONTENTS 1.

Savatthi, Place of the Twin Miracle a) How to reach there Savatthi or Sravasti is located in the Bahraich district of Uttar Pradesh, 160 km east of the capital Lucknow. The site is 21 km west of Balrampur, a station on the Gorakhpur-Gonda line of the North-Eastern Railway. All distances are approximate. b) Religious Significance 1, 2 Sravasti was the ancient capital of the Kingdom of Kosala ruled by King Pasenadi , a lay disciple and great admirer of the Buddha. It owes its fame to its long and close association with the Buddha’s ministry. Of the 45 years of his ministry, the Buddha spent as many as 25 rains-retreats, 24 of them continuously (21 st -44 th ) at Sravasti. It was here that the millionaire Sudatta , popularly known as Anathapindika or “Feeder of the Poor”, donated the famous Jetavana or Jeta’s Grove to the Buddha after he had bought it at an exorbitant price, which was “as many gold coins as would cover it”. Since the Buddha spent a major part of his missionary life in Sravasti, the majority of sermons in the scriptures were deliv- ered while staying in Jetavana. Another important monastery at Sravasti was the Pubbarama , donated by the Lady Visakha , chief benefactress of the Buddha. Sravasti became an important place of pilgrimage because here the Buddha performed the greatest miracle of all, the Twin Miracle , in order to dispel the heretics. In a series of miraculous episodes, the Buddha created multiple representations of Himself, seated and standing on lotuses, causing fire and water to emanate from"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"104 105 his body. This marvelous event, called the Miracle of Sravasti , is a favourite subject of Buddhist sculptures. c) Historical Background 6, 9 King Asoka visited Sravasti in 249 BC as part of his pilgrimage to the holy Buddhist shrines and erected two pillars, each 70 feet high, on both sides of the eastern gate of Jetavana, as well as some stupas to enshrine the relics of the Buddha. During the time of the Kusana kings, Kaniska and Huviska , in the 1 st -2 nd century AD, new shrines were installed to enshrine Buddha images which were becoming popular at the time. When Fa Hsien visited Sravasti in 407 AD, Buddhism had declined in the city but Jetavana was still occupied by monks. He saw the two Asokan pillars still standing but the stupas of Angulimala and Sudatta were in ruins. By the time Hsüan Tsang came to Sravasti in 637 AD, the main city was in ruins and there were several hundreds of sangharamas , mostly in ruin with very few religious followers. Jetavana was decayed and deserted. He also saw both columns erected by Asoka, the ruins of stupas, sangharamas and the well from which the Buddha used to draw water for his use. After Hsüan Tsang’s visit, Jetavana was again occupied, as evi - denced by the recovery of seals and images of Mahayanist pan- theons such as Lokanatha, Avalokitesvara and others belonging to the 8 th and 9 th century AD. The last patrons of Jetavana were King Govindachandra and his devout Buddhist wife Kumaradevi of Kanauj and Benares (1130 AD). Records of their gift of six villages to the Sangha of Jetavana monastery were found in a copper char - ter discovered during excavation of the ruins. With the downfall of Buddhism in India in the 13 th century AD, the Jetavana shrines became deserted and fell into oblivion."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"106 107 In 1863, Cunningham identified a vast collection of twin ruins called Sahet-Mahet with the ancient city of Sravasti. He excavated the ruins at Sahet covering 13 hectares , identified with Jetavana and exposed the remains of several stupas, temples and monaster - ies, including the site of the famous Gandha-kuti or Perfumed Chamber as well as the Kosambi kuti , both used by the Buddha. Most of the ruins exposed in Jetavana were from the Kusana per- iod ( 1 st -2 nd century AD). The ruins at Mahet are very extensive, spreading over 162 hectares . Only a few ruins have been identi - fied while most parts of it are still unexplored. In recent times, the first monastery to be built in Sravasti was the Burmese Vihara , at the initiative of Ven. Chandramani of Kushinagar. This was fol - lowed by the Chinese Buddhist Temple founded by the Ven. Ren Chen . In 1969, the Maha Bodhi Society of India became directly involved with Sravasti with the arrival of Ven. Sangharatana of Sarnath, who initiated the construction of the Nava Jetavana Vihara just outside the old Jetavana. In 1982, the Thais too, estab - lished a vihara in Sravasti. d) Objects of Interest 6, 9 Jetavana Park During the Buddha’s time, the place was called Jetavana Anathapindika Arama or Anathapindika’s Garden of Jeta Grove . Today most of the ruins are the remains of temples and stupas from the Kusana period (1 st -2 nd century AD). The important shrines are: (i) Temple No. 2 The ruins here mark the site of the Gandha-kuti (Perfumed Chamber) built by Anathapindika for the Buddha’s use. According to the commentaries, the site of the Buddha’s bed in it is the same"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"106 107 for all Buddhas , irrespective of the size of the Gandha-kuti. The original Gandha-kuti was wooden but by the time the Chinese pilgrims saw it, the structure was a two-storeyed brick building in a ruinous condition. Now only the low walls and stone platform are extant. This is a favourite site for pilgrims to perform puja and meditate . (ii) Temple No. 3 This temple is believed to be the site of the original Kosambi kuti , also built by Anathapindika earlier for the Buddha’s use as a meditation room. Just in front of it is a long plinth, made of bricks, marking the site of the original promenade ( cankama ) used by the Buddha for walking meditation. (iii) Stupa H This stupa is believed to mark the place where the Buddha used to preach to the monks and laity. It was erected in front of the Gandha-kuti Temple and was rebuilt several times, pointing to its importance as a sacred shrine. (iv) Ananda Bodhi Tree The Ananda Bodhi tree is located near the entrance of Jetavana. It was planted at the request of Anathapindika so that the laity would have an object to worship during the Buddha’s absence from Savatthi to propagate the Dhamma after each vassa . When Ven. Ananda reported the matter to the Buddha, the latter replied that there were three types of objects of veneration, namely: the corporeal relic deposited in a stupa after the Buddha’s Parinibbana , an object used by the Buddha such as his alms-bowl, etc. and a visible symbol such as a Dhammacakka wheel."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"108 109 The first was not possible while the Buddha was alive, while the third object was not appropriate for those who were not content with a mere symbol or picture. So only the second remained and the Buddha suggested the Bodhi tree as the best object to vener - ate in his absence. So it was decided to plant a small shoot of the Bodhi tree from Bodhgaya and Ven. Moggallana , foremost in psy - chic ability, was assigned the task of obtaining the sapling. When it arrived, the young shoot was ceremoniously planted at the gate of Jetavana by Anathapindika . The tree grew and became an object of veneration to the laity. At the request of Ven Ananda, the Buddha spent one night meditating under it, adding sanctity to the tree. The present tree looks very old from its hoary appearance but it is not possible to confirm whether it is the original tree or a descendant of it. (v) Sudatta Stupa North of Jetavana, in the ruins of Mahet (old Sravasti) stands the Sudatta stupa , the most imposing monument in the area. According to Fa Hsien, this stupa was built on the foundations of the house of Sudatta , popularly known as Anathapindika. The ruins show struc - tural remains from the 1 st -12 th century AD. From the road, one has to climb up several flights of steps to reach the plinth, where one can see the sunken basements of two circular stupas. (vi) Angulimala Stupa Near the Sudatta stupa is a mass of bricks with a tunnel in the middle, identified by Cunningham as the Angulimala stupa seen by the Chinese pilgrims. The tunnel was cut through the whole mound at the base to serve as a drain, helping to preserve the monument. According to Fa Hsien, the stupa marks the site where Angulimala was cremated ."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"108 109 (vii) Place where Devadatta Sank into the Earth According to the Dhammapada commentary, after Devadatta created a schism in the Sangha, he left to form his own faction. Thereafter his fortune took a turn for the worse and eventually he fell sick for nine months. Knowing his end was near, he instructed his disciples to carry him to Jetavana to see the Buddha for the last time. When the Buddha heard about this, he predicted that Devadatta would not succeed in seeing him at all. As Devadatta was being carried in a litter, they passed a lotus pond outside Jetavana. Putting the litter down, his disciples went into the lotus pond to bathe. Devadatta arose from his litter and sat down, rest - ing both feet on the ground whereupon his feet sank into the earth. By degrees he sank into the earth, first to his ankles , then to the knees , then to the hips , then to the chest and then to the neck . Before he was completely swallowed by the earth, he managed to verbally take refuge in the Buddha. Thereafter he was reborn in Avici Hell to suffer for his bad kamma. The place where Devadatta sank into the earth is believed to be the swampy area behind the Burmese Vihara. (viii) Stupa of the Great Miracle According to the commentaries, the Buddha ascended to Tavatimsa Heaven to preach to his mother during the 7 th rains-retreat. Prior to his ascent, he had performed the Twin Miracle and other mir- aculous feats to silence the heretics at a place where the gardener Ganda had planted a mango tree. This place is believed to be at the top of a hillock near the Nikko Lotus Hotel as one enters Sravasti. In the year 2000, excavations were carried out on this hillock, which revealed the remains of a brick stupa believed to be erected by King Asoka. The area has now been fenced in to pro -"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"110 111 tect the ruins of the Miracle stupa on top of the hillock. This stupa is known locally as ‘Orajhar’. (ix) Burmese and Sri Lankan Monasteries Pilgrims visiting Sravasti should visit both monasteries to pay their respects to the monks and find out more about the monu - ments from them. The Sri Lankan monastery is named Nava (New) Jetavana Vihara and inside it one can see beautiful murals on its walls depicting important events in the Buddha’s life. The monastery also possesses some Buddha relics , which it keeps in a stupa -shaped vessel to show to visiting pilgrims. The Burmese vihara is named the Burmese Buddhist Temple and the abbot is the Venerable Sayadaw U Awbatha . According to the Sayadaw, although the temple is situated outside the fenced-in Jetavana Park, its precincts were once part of the old Jetavana grove. The Burmese vihara has been recently renovated and now offers free accommo - dation to pilgrims who visit Sravasti."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"110 111 2. Sankasia, Place of the Descent from Heaven a) How to reach there Sankasia is located in the village of Sankisa-Basantapur in Farruk- habad district of Uttar Pradesh, where the borders of Farrukhabad, Etah and Mainpuri districts meet. From Delhi, the most practi - cal way to visit Sankasia is to take the Shatabdhi express from Delhi to Etawah , arriving there at about 10.30 am and transfer to a coach. Immediately after lunch, one should proceed by coach via Kishni-Bewar-Muhammadabad to Sankasia arriving there at about three in the afternoon. After visiting Sankasia, one should travel via Chhibramau-Kannauj to Kanpur. Distance from Sankasia to Kanpur is about 220 km and the journey is expected to take 5 hours. Time of arrival at the hotel is estimated at 10 pm. b) Religious Significance 1, 2, 4 According to Dhammapada Commentary XIV, 2, after the Buddha had completed the rains-retreat in Tavatimsa Heaven, he informed Sakka of his intention to return to earth. Thereupon, Sakka created three ladders; one of gold, one of jewels and one of silver, the tops of which rested on the summit of Mt. Sumeru and the feet of which rested against the gate of the city of Sankasia. On the right side was the golden ladder for the devas , on the left side was the silver ladder for Brahma and his train, and in the middle was the jewelled ladder for the Buddha . As the Buddha descended upon the jewelled ladder, the devas and Brahmas honored him by accompanying him on each side. With this retinue the Buddha"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"112 113 descended and set foot on earth at the gate of the city of Sankasia. Because of this miraculous event which was witnessed by a great multitude, Sankasia became an important Buddhist shrine and several stupas and viharas were erected there. c) Historical Background 6, 9 King Asoka visited Sankasia as part of the itinerary of his pilgrim - age in 249 BC. According to Fa Hsien , Asoka built a shrine over the spot where the Buddha set foot on earth. Behind the shrine, he raised a stone column 18.3 m high with a lion capital on top and on its four sides he placed Buddha images. Fa Hsien also saw other stupas and viharas where about 1,000 monks and nuns resided. When Hsüan Tsang arrived in 636 AD, he saw the great sangha- rama of beautiful construction, wherein lived 100 monks and religious laymen. He also saw the Asoka column 21 m high with carved figures on the four sides and around it, and mentioned the presence of some stupas. Other than these accounts of the Chinese pilgrims, the history of Sankasia remained blank for the next 1,200 years until Cunningham identified it with the modern village of Sankisa-Basantapur in the Farrukhabad District of Uttar Pradesh. The present village is situated on a 12.2 m high plateau within an area of 457 m by 305 m or roughly 14 hectares. d) Objects of Interest 6, 9 (i) Broken Asoka Column with Elephant Capital The Elephant Capital that once surmounted the Asoka column is an important relic of the 3 rd century BC . It is kept in a fenced up pavilion. Nearby under a tree, is a small shrine with a standing"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"112 113 image of Lord Buddha, flanked by Brahma and Sakka to depict the Buddha’s descent from Heaven. (ii) Site where the Buddha Descended from Heaven About 20 metres to the south of the Asokan pillar is a high mound composed of solid brickwork, which was once a Buddhist struc - ture. According to Hsüan Tsang, when the ladders by which the Buddha descended from Heaven had disappeared, the neighbour - ing princes built up a new foundation on the ancient founda - tion (three ladders) resembling the old ones. There was a vihara on the foundation and close by its side was a stone column 21 m high, which was erected by Asoka-raja. After the disappearance of Buddhism from India, the vihara probably followed the same fate as many other Buddhist establishments and fell into ruins. On top of the foundation now is a small shrine dedicated to a Hindu goddess Visharidevi. It is believed that the Buddha set foot at this place when he descended from Heaven at Sankasia. (iii) Burmese and Sri Lankan Viharas The first Buddhist monk to reside in Sankasia was the late Ven. Vijaya Soma from Sri Lanka, who established a school there. It is indeed heartening to see two Buddhist monasteries now in Sankasia in spite of its remote location. The Burmese monastery was opened in the year 2000 while the Sri Lankan monastery was built a few years earlier. Pilgrims visiting Sankasia should visit these monasteries to pay their respects to the bhikkhus, whose pres - ence has enhanced the sanctity of this rural environment."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"114 115 3. Rajgir, Place of Taming the Drunken Elephant, Nalagiri a) How to reach there Rajgir is situated in the Nalanda district of Bihar, 70 km north- east of Bodhgaya and 102 km south of Patna. All distances are approximate. b) Religious Significance 1, 2, 4 Rajgir is the modern name of Rajagaha or “ royal abode ”, an appro - priate designation for a place that had remained as the capital of the powerful kingdom of Magadha for centuries. In the Buddha’s time, the ruler was King Bimbisara , who was later usurped by his parricidal son, Ajatasattu . In his first meeting with the Bodhisatta , Bimbisara was so impressed by his royal bearing that he offered to share his kingdom with the Bodhisatta. The latter, who had just renounced his Sakyan kingdom in search of the Deathless , de - clined the offer but promised to return to visit Rajgir after he had attained his goal. Soon after dispatching the Sangha to spread the Dhamma from Sarnath , the Buddha traveled to Uruvela , where he converted the Kassapa brothers and their matted-hair disciples, who all attained Arahantship . With this retinue of one thousand Arahants, the Buddha entered Rajgir, where he was warmly received by Bimbisara, who became a lay follower and offered the famous Bamboo Garden ( Veluvana) , to the Buddha and the Sangha. As the capital of a powerful state, Rajgir was a hive of secular and religious activities. According to the Samannaphala Sutta, many heretical teachers operated in Rajgir, namely: Purana Kassapa,"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"114 115 Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambali, Pakudha Kaccayana, Nigantha Nattaputta and Sanjaya Belatthaputta. Among the disci - ples of Sanjaya were two rich brahmins, Upatissa and Kolita , popu - larly known as Sariputta and Moggallana respectively. Both joined the Sangha after their conversion by the Arahant Assaji , and became the Buddha’s first and second Chief Disciples . Following their con - version, many paribbajakas or wandering ascetics also became fol - lowers of the Buddha. Among the laity, the most notable disciples were the royal physician Jivaka , adopted son of Prince Abhaya; and the millionaire Upali , a follower of Nigantha Nattaputta, who was sent to convert the Buddha but ended up as a lay disciple instead. Thus Rajgir became an important centre of Buddhism as the fame of the Buddha spread throughout Magadha . Rajgir was also the scene of many attempts by Devadatta to kill the Buddha over the leadership of the Sangha. First he hired arch - ers to assassinate the Buddha, but they were all converted by the Buddha instead. Next, as the Buddha was walking up the slopes of Gijjhakuta (Vulture Peak) one day, Devadatta hurled a rock from the summit at the Buddha but it missed and a splinter wounded the Buddha’s foot. Finally, he caused the elephant Nalagiri to be intoxicated with liquor and sent the ferocious beast to charge at the Buddha. But the Buddha subdued the animal with his loving kindness . Because of this miracle, Rajgir became sanctified as an important pilgrimage site. While Devadatta was plotting against the Buddha, Ajatasattu , at his instigation, usurped the throne and imprisoned his father in order to starve him to death. He regretted his actions too late, as his father had died before he could release him. Ajatasattu, later at the suggestion of Jivaka , sought the Buddha’s advice and became a lay disciple . After the Buddha’s Mahaparinibbana, he led an army to Kusinara to claim a share"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"116 117 of the Buddha’s relics. He was the patron of the First Sangiti or Council held at Sattapanni Cave in Rajgir. (c) Historical Background 6, 9, 21 Rajgir lost its political status after Ajatasattu’s son, Udayibhadda , slew his father and transferred the capital to Pataliputta . But the fact that Asoka erected a stupa and a stone pillar with an elephant capital during his pilgrimage to Rajgir, shows that the place remained as an important Buddhist centre for centuries. When Fa Hsien came during the fifth century he found the old city deso - late, but outside the hills at Veluvana he found a band of monks living in the monastery. When Hsüan Tsang visited Rajgir in 637-638 AD, it was practically deserted. Of the ancient monaster - ies and stupas he found only foundation walls and ruins standing. He saw the Asoka stupa which was 18.3 m high and by the side of it, the Asokan pillar , about 15.2 m high with an elephant capi - tal, the Pippala stone house said to be the cave of Mahakassapa and the Sattapanni caves. He also visited Gijjhakuta and saw a brick vihara at the western end of the hill and several stupas in the vicinity. Although there is no record of Rajgir after Hsüan Tsang’s visit, the antiquities recovered from Rajgir during archeological excav- ations in 1905-06 showed that it continued to be a popular Buddhist shrine up to the 12 th century AD. According to Fa Hsien, Ajatasattu built a new citadel outside the circle of five hills, namely: Vebhara , Pandava , Vepulla , Gijjhakuta and Isigili; that encircled the old Rajagaha city. The modern village of Rajgir encloses a part of this “ New Rajagaha ” which was protected by a massive wall of earth resembling an irregular pentagon in shape, with a circuit of 5 km. On the south, towards the hills, one can still see the stone"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"116 117 fortifications that once protected the old city. The wall is 4.6 m to 5.5 m thick and rises to a height of 3.4 m at some places. d) Objects of Interest 6, 9, 21 (i) Veluvana (Bamboo Grove) and Karanda Tank When King Bimbisara heard that the Buddha had come to Rajgir with a retinue of one thousand Arahants, he went to the Sapling Grove to meet the Buddha and was converted by the Buddha, attaining the First Stage of Sainthood . Thereafter, he invited the Buddha to his palace for the following day’s meal, after which he donated the famous Bamboo Grove or Veluvana , the first dona - tion of a park ( arama ) , to the Buddha and Sangha. When the writer first visited Veluvana in 1991, the place was slightly overgrown with bushes and on the south side towards the hot springs a number of Muslim tombs could be seen on a large mound to the left of the main entrance. The cemetery is believed to be the site of the Veluvana Vihara built by Bimbisara for the Buddha’s residence. The whole area has been cleaned up and Veluvana now looks like a pleasant park, planted with shade trees, bamboo and flowers, reflecting its original status as the royal park of King Bimbisara. In the vicinity of Veluvana is a large pond with a Buddha image at the centre. This pond is believed to be the site of the Karanda tank mentioned in Buddhist text as the Karanda kanivapa where the Buddha used to take his bath. (ii) Pippala House A short distance from Veluvana, at the foot of Vebhara hill, are the hot springs of Rajgir, a popular picnic spot for bathing. A little above the hot springs, on the right side of the path uphill, is a"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"118 119 remarkable stone structure known locally as the “ machan ” (watch- tower). The structure is roughly cube-shaped with dimensions of 26 m long by 25 m wide by 7 m high and is built of unhewn blocks of stone set on the rock. According to Sir John Marshall , who excavated the site in 1905-06, the structure was originally a watch- tower and “in after times, when no longer required for defensive purposes, they would afford convenient cells for ascetics to medi - tate in”. This structure is believed to be the Pippala stone house , residence of Ven . Maha Kassapa , Convenor of the First Council . According to Samyutta V, 78 , the Buddha visited Maha Kassapa on one occasion when the latter was ill and expounded the Seven Factors of Enlightenment , upon hearing which Maha Kassapa recovered from the illness. (iii) Sattapanni caves The Sattapanni caves, site of the First Buddhist Council held three months after the Mahaparinibbana in 543 BC, is situated on top of Vebhara hill, beyond the largest Jains temple. There a narrow foot - path descends some 30 m to a long artificial terrace in front of a line of six caves (there might have been seven originally). The caves have been sealed off to ensure the safety of visitors. The terrace in front of the caves is about 36.6 m long and 10.4 m at the widest point and part of the retaining wall of large unhewn stones on the outer edge can still be seen. This place agrees with the description of Sattapanni found in the Pali texts, where five hundred Arahants convened to codify the Buddha’s Teaching . Over the last 2,500 years a lot of erosion would have taken place, so the terrace was probably bigger in those days, to accommodate so many Arahants."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"118 119 (iv) Bimbisara Jail About 21⁄2 km south of Veluvana beside the main road is an area about 60 m square enclosed by the remains of a stone wall 2 m thick. This area has been identified as the prison in which Bimbisara was jailed by his son Ajatasattu, who usurped the throne. It is said that from this prison the king could see the Buddha up in Gijjhakuta, the sight of whom provided great joy to the prisoner. (v) Jivaka’s mango garden (Jivaka ambavana) According to Pali sources, Jivaka’s mango garden is situated between the city’s East Gate and Gijjhakuta , and the site has been identified a short distance from the foot of Gijjhakuta. According to the Vinaya Texts, Jivaka Komarabhacca was the adopted son of Prince Abhaya , who found him alive ( jivati ) in a dust heap when he was an infant and raised him up. When he was old enough, he set out for Taxila to study medicine for seven years. To test his knowledge , his teacher asked him to go all round Taxila to search for any plant which was not medicinal and bring it back. Jivaka proved to be so proficient in medicinal plants that he returned after a long search and declared that he had not seen any plant that was not medicinal within a yojana (13 km) of Taxila. Returning to Rajgir, he cured many people suffering from seri - ous ailments and even performed surgery, something unheard of in those days. He became the leading physician and surgeon of Rajgir and earned great wealth through his medical practice. At some point in his career, he became a lay disciple and used to attend on the Buddha three times a day. When the Buddha’s foot was injured by a splinter from a rock hurled by Devadatta, it was Jivaka who attended on him and healed the wound . Realizing the advantages of having a monastery near his home, Jivaka built one"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"120 121 on his extensive mango garden and donated it to the Buddha. The site of this monastery was excavated recently , which exposed the buried foundations of elliptical buildings, possibly of monastic nature, of an early date. (vi) Gijjhakuta (Vulture Peak) Gijjhakuta hill was the favourite resort of the Buddha and the scene of many important discourses while he was in Rajgir. To reach the top, one has to climb up a long stone stairway , 6.1 m to 7.3 m wide, called the Bimbisara road , built by the King to en - able him to reach the summit to see the Buddha. The rocky path ends near the top of the hill where one can see two natural caves believed to be used by Ven . Sariputta and Ven . Ananda . At the summit, one can see the huge granite rock formation resembling a vulture standing with folded wings, from which the hill derived its name. Recently, a cement staircase has been constructed to facilitate the pilgrim’s climb to the top, which is a flat terrace sur - rounded by a low retaining wall with a shrine near the precipice. This spot offers a commanding view of the valley below. It is a favourite place for pilgrims to perform puja or circumambulate while reciting the virtues of the Buddha. Nearby is another small - er cave believed to be used by Ven . Moggallana . (vii) Maddakucchi (Rub-belly) The Pali name maddakucchi , which means “ rub-belly ”, was derived from a story that at this place the queen of Bimbisara, knowing that she was carrying a patricide , tried to abort the foetus by a forcible massage of her belly. Maddakucchi, which finds men - tion in the Pali scriptures, is situated at the base of Gijjhakuta. It is believed to be the place where the Buddha was brought by stretcher after being wounded on the leg by a splinter of a big rock"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"120 121 hurled by Devadatta from the summit of Gijjhakuta hill. Formerly, this place contained a deer park and a monastery. (viii) Burmese Monastery The Burmese monastery standing on top of a hillock in New Rajgir was the first modern monastery established in Rajgir in 1958 by an old Theravada monk, Sayadaw U Zayanta . Recently a new shrine hall has been built to enshrine a sacred Buddha relic . (ix) Ruins of Nalanda Mahavihara The ruins of Nalanda Mahavihara were first excavated in 1871 by Sir Alexander Cunningham, who identified its site at the modern village of Bargaon on the basis of the accounts of the Chinese pil - grim, Hsüan Tsang. Located only 12 km from Rajgir , the ruins ex - tend over a vast area. The structures exposed represent only a part of the vast establishment and consist of monastic sites , stupa sites and temple sites . Lengthwise, they extend from south to north, the monasteries on the eastern flank and temples on the west. The monasteries were all built on more or less the same plan and to date at least eleven monastic sites and five main temple sites have been identified. The most prominent standing structure at Nalanda is the Sariputta stupa , erected in honour of the Chief Disciple, who was born and passed away in the nearby village of Nalaka ."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"122 123 4. Vesali, Place of Offering of Honey by a Band of Monkeys a) How to reach there Vesali or Vaishali is located around the village of Basrah in the Muzaffapur district of Bihar, 55 km north of Patna across the Ganges River. All distances are approximate. b) Religious Significance 1, 2, 3 Vesali or Vaishali , capital of the Licchavis or Vajjis , was the head - quarters of the powerful Vajjian confederacy of eight clans, of whom the Licchavis and Videhans were the most important. It was the first republic in the world modelled on the Aparihaniya Dhamma , or the seven conditions leading to welfare, which the Buddha taught to the Vajjians when he was dwelling at the Saranda shrine in Vaishali. Thus united, they became so powerful that Ajatasattu of Magadha had to resort to treachery by sending the brahmin Vassakara to sow discord among the Vajjian princes for three years in order to weaken them. By then, they were too disunited to defend their country and Ajatasattu conquered them. The Buddha visited Vaishali several times, spending his 5 th and 44 th vassas there and many Licchavi nobles became his disciples. When Vaishali was plagued with famine , disease , and evil spir - its , the Buddha was invited by the Licchavi nobles to help them alleviate the plagues. The Buddha then preached the Ratana Sutta (Jewel Discourse) and instructed Ven . Ananda to go around the city walls reciting it as a Protection . Thereafter, the Buddha recited it for seven days and all the plagues then abated. But the"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"122 123 event that elevated the status of Vaishali to an important pilgrim - age site was the offering of a bowl of honey by a band of monkeys to the Blessed One, an incident mentioned among the Four Great Miracles in the Buddha’s life. At Vaishali, the Buddha allowed women to be admitted to the Sangha after Ven . Ananda successfully pleaded to the Buddha for the ordination of Maha Pajapati Gotami and several Sakyan ladies. The Buddha then decreed the Eight Chief Rules , in addi - tion to the Disciplinary Code observed by monks, which bhikk - hunis or nuns “should revere, reverence, honour and respect for life and which should not be transgressed”. Thus the Bhikkhuni Sangha came to be established in Vaishali. Once, the Buddha was staying in a mango grove of Ambapali , the chief courtesan of Vaishali, who invited him to a house dana, forestalling the Licchavi nobles who then offered her money in exchange for the invitation. But she politely declined their offer for she valued the dana more and after the meals even donated her mango grove to the Buddha and Sangha. The Buddha spent the last vassa in Vesali where he relinquished the will to live at the Capala shrine. After the Mahaparinibbana, the Licchavis obtained a share of the Buddha’s relics from Kusinara and erected a grand stupa over the holy relics in Vaishali. c) Historical Background 5, 6, 9, 22 After the Mahaparinibbana, the Vajjian confederacy was defeated by Ajatasattu , whose son Udayibhadda slew his father and moved the capital from Rajgir to Pataliputta , across the Ganges river from Vaishali. According to the Mahavamsa (Great Chronicle of Ceylon), the dynasty of Udayibhadda was succeeded by three"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"124 125 generations of parricidal kings, namely: Anuruddha , Munda and Nagadasa , who each slew his own father to take over the throne. By then, the people could not tolerate this dynasty of parricides . Nagadasa was deposed by the minister Sisunaga , son of a Licchavi prince. Sisunnaga was succeeded by his son, Kalasoka , and by then a hundred years had passed since the Mahaparinibbana. At that time in Vaishali, many shameless bhikkhus of the Vajji clan were practising the Ten Points , which were not in conformity with the Vinaya or monastic rules. The Venerable Yasa of Kosambi, while in Vaishali, noticed the deviations and strongly protested against them, resulting in his expulsion by the Vajji monks. Ven. Yasa, together with other monks appealed to Ven . Revata of Soreyya, the chief of the Sangha to settle the dispute. Thereupon, the Second Council was convened at Valukarama monastery in Vaishali during the reign of King Kalasoka and attended by seven hundred Arahants . The Venerable Sabbakami , the most senior Arahant, questioned by Ven. Revata, adjudged the Ten Points as unlawful according to the Vinaya. Although the decision was accepted unanimously by the Council, the Vajjian monks did not accept the verdict. This resulted in a schism in the Sangha and the secession of the Mahasanghika (Vajji monks), who held a great assembly of their own called the Mahasangiti , from which the sect derived its name, and decided matters according to their own light. From then on, further schisms led to the formation of dif - ferent subsects, and in the course of time, eleven sub-sects arose out of the Theravada while seven issued from the Mahasanghika , leading to the well-known Eighteen Schools of Buddhism . Asoka , the Mauryan emperor who had his capital in Pataliputta , near Vaishali, raised a stupa in which he enshrined some of the Buddha’s relics and erected beside it an Asokan column with a lion"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"124 125 capital when he visited Vaishali during his pilgrimage to the holy places in 249 BC. Fa Hsien visited Vaishali around 400 AD and mentioned the stupas built in its vicinity in honour of the Buddha. He also saw a stupa built at the site of the Second Council as well as a stupa built over half the remains of Ven . Ananda . According to a story, when Ven. Ananda reached the age of 120 years he knew that his end was near and went from Rajgir to Vaishali, following the Buddha’s example. Hearing of his intention, the citizens of Magadha and Vaishali hurried from both directions to bid him farewell. To do justice to both sides, Ven. Ananda levi - tated in the air and entered into the Samadhi of the Fire Element , whereby the body was consumed by spontaneous combustion and reduced to ashes, which fell on both sides. So the people of each city taking half the relics , returned and erected stupas over them. Hsüan Tsang , who came in 630 AD, described Vaishali as cover - ing an area of 26-31 sq. km, but it was in ruins. He saw the stupa built by the Licchavi princes over their portion of the Buddha’s relics from Kusinara, the Asoka stupa and stone pillar surmounted by a lion capital and nearby the pond dug by a band of mon - keys ( Markata-hrada ) for the Buddha’s use. Not far to the south were two more stupas; one at the site where the monkeys, tak - ing the Buddha’s alms-bowl , climbed up a tree to gather honey and another at the site where the monkeys offered honey to the Blessed One. Hsüan Tsang wrote that both within and without and all around the city of Vaishali, the sacred monuments were so numerous that it was difficult to remember them all. After Hsüan Tsang’s visit, the history of Vaishali remained blank for over twelve centuries . It lay in ruins , unknown and unheard of until the late 19 th century, when Cunningham identified the ruins at and around Basrah in Muzaffapur district of Bihar with ancient"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"126 127 Vaishali. Today, most of the principal ruins are located in the vil - lage of Kolhua , about 55 km from Patna. d) Objects of Interest 6, 9, 27 (i) Raj Vishal ka Garh Basrah, 35 km south-west of Muzaffarpur, has been identified as the site of the ancient city of Vaishali. The site of the Raj Vishal ka Garh is believed to represent the citadel of Vaishali , where the 7,707 rajas or representatives of the Vajjian confederacy used to meet and discuss the problems of the day. The ruins consist of a large brick-covered mound 2.5 m above the surrounding level and 1,500 m in circumference, with a 42.7 m moat surrounding it. Beside it is a pond believed to have been used by the Licchavi princes to take their bath. It is located about 3.2 km south-west of the Asokan pillar at Kolhua. (ii) Relic Stupa of the Licchavis About a kilometre to the north-west of the citadel stands an open shelter with a dome-shaped roof. Inside it are the remains of a stupa, which was originally a mud structure with thin layers of cloddy clay, 25 feet in diameter. It appeared to have undergone enlarge- ment in which burnt bricks were used, increasing its diameter to 40 feet. The original mud stupa was a very old one, believed to be pre-Mauryan. From its primitive features and from the fact that a trench had been driven into its core in olden times, it is believed that this stupa is none other than the one erected by the Licchavis over their share of the relics of the Buddha. The trench was prob - ably excavated by Asoka to reach the relics, some of which, accord - ing to Hsüan Tsang, were left in their original position by Asoka."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"126 127 (iii) Asokan Pillar At Kolhua, 3.2 km north-east of the citadel of Vaishali, stands the impressive Asokan Pillar erected by Asoka 2,250 years ago. It is a complete monolithic pillar of highly polished sandstone surmount - ed by a lion capital. The height is 6.7 m above the ground with a considerable portion sunk underground over the years. Though devoid of inscription, it appears to be a part of the line of pillars that Asoka erected along his pilgrimage route from Pataliputta to Lumbini during 250-249 BC. Around the Asokan Pillar at Kolhua are the ruins of many smaller brick stupas. (iv) Asoka Stupa Just near the Asokan pillar are the ruins of the Asoka Stupa seen by Hsüan Tsang. The dome-shaped mound is 4.6 m high and has a diameter of 20 m. During excavation by Cunningham, a stone casket containing some relics of the Buddha was found enshrined beneath it. This site is a conducive place to offer puja, followed by walking or sitting meditation at the stupa. (v) Monkey’s Tank (Markata-hrada) Near the stone pillar is a small tank (pond) called Rama-kunda, identified by Cunningham with the ancient monkey’s tank believed to have been dug by a colony of monkeys for the Buddha’s use. e) Places of Interest in Patna 6, 23 (i) Kumhrar or Asokarama Park This park in Patna is believed to be the site of the Third Buddhist Council held in Pataliputta in the 17 th year of King Asoka’s reign, about 236 years after the Mahaparinibbana. It was attended by 1,000 Arahants and presided over by the Venerable Moggaliputta"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"128 129 Tissa . At this Council, the Kathavatthu or Points of Controversy , one of the seven books of the Abhidhamma, was compiled wherein the heretical doctrines were thoroughly examined and refuted. The Third Council marked a turning point for Buddhism which, prior to this, was confined mainly to Magadha and some neighbouring states. With King Asoka of the Mauryan empire reigning supreme over the whole Indian sub-continent as its chief patron, the time was now ripe for expansion. Accordingly, it was decided to send competent Arahants to propagate the Buddha’s Teachings all over India as well as Sri Lanka in the south , Kashmir and Gandhara in the north , Bengal and Burma in the east and Yonaka and countries in the west . Thus the Teachings of the Buddha spread in the four directions after the Third Council. At the Kumhrar one can see a large pool, where 32 ancient pillars of polished sandstone were found, a specimen of which is exhib - ited at a nearby pavilion. Within the vicinity of the park is the site of a vihara of Asoka’s time. (ii) Patna Museum (Closed on Mondays) The museum at Patna, capital of Bihar, where Buddhism origi - nated, houses one of the largest collections of ancient Buddhist antiquities in the world. The sculptures of stone and bronze on display can be divided into a few distinct periods, namely: • Mauryan Sculptures (4th-3rd century BC) On display here are Indian stone sculptures of highly polished sandstone in magnificent forms of animals such as the lion, bull and elephant capitals, fashioned to be placed atop Asokan pillars . Besides this refined courtly art, an archaic religious art based on"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"128 129 the widespread cult of tutelary deities is on display, featuring the gigantic Patna yaksa ( yakkha ) and yaksi (female yakkha ) . • Gandhara and Mathura Buddha Images Prior to the beginning of the Christian era, the Buddha was never represented in human form but only by symbols. The demand for Buddha images started when the movement of ‘ Bhakti ’ or devo - tion gained strength among the Buddhist laity due to Mahayana influence. Buddha images came into existence in the first century AD , when two ancient schools of sculpture emerged separately – Gandhara (Afghanistan) in the far north-west of India and Mathura (Muttra) in the east. In Gandhara , the Buddha-image is represented in Grecian style , almost Apollo-like in physical beauty and even the robe is sculpted with folds characteristic of Greco-Roman sculpture. The contours are not rounded off and great pains are taken to model the human form to display the physical perfection through sharp , elegant features. In Mathura , the sculptures are indigenous , in the Mahapurisa style, large and rounded . A typical example is Bhikkhu Bala’s image of the Bodhisatta in Sarnath. The treatment of the Buddha’s robe is schematic and clinging, so no folds are shown and the body is revealed as though it were nude. In Patna Museum one is able to see some rare specimens of Buddha and Bodhisatta images from Gandhara that survived destruction by Muslim fanatics when they conquered Northern India. • Gupta Period (AD 300-550) The Gupta period was the golden age of Indian art and the great Buddha images of Mathura, Sarnath, Ajanta and Bihar are magnificent specimens from this age.

For stone sculptures, Nalanda in Bihar state was famous for its distinc- tive black slate Buddha images . In Patna Museum there is a sec - tion showing black slate and bronze images of the Buddha and some bronze images of Tantric deities as the cult of Tantrayana , a decadent and perverse form of worship of deities unrelated to the Buddha’s Teaching, emerged during the Pala Period."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"130 131 Examples of Gandhara Sculpture from Calcutta Museum: Birth of Gautama"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"132 133 Bodhisatta Padmapani"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"132 133 P IV T   E G P CONTENTS 1.

Travelling to the Pilgrimage Places in India All the pilgrimage places described in this book are located in the Northern Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar , except Lumbini, which is in Nepal . In ancient times, this area was called Puratthima (Eastern Tract) but today it is known as the Buddhist Circuit . The majority of the Buddhist shrines are in remote places where taxi service and public transport are poor, making it diffi - cult to get there unless one travels in a group by chartered bus. The capacity of the tour bus is normally 35 seats and air-conditioning is provided at extra cost. The suggested group size is around 25 persons , so that it is not too crowded. For a smaller group, an 18- seater air-conditioned coach is also available. For the first-time pilgrim, travelling in a group is the best way to visit the Eight Great Places for several reasons. First is the conven - ience , since all the travelling arrangements and itinerary would have been made by someone who has experience in the pilgrim - age. Secondly, group travel provides safety , especially for female pilgrims. Lastly, and probably most important is the spirit of Buddhist fellowship among pilgrims travelling together, especial - ly in the company of a venerable monk to act as a spiritual advisor, making the journey more pleasant and meaningful. A minor dis - advantage of a group tour is that the itinerary is less flexible . The best time to travel in Northern India is during autumn/ winter , from November to February when the weather is pleas - ant. From March to June, the weather is hot and dusty while from July to October, the rainy season sets in.

Suggested Itinerary When organizing a pilgrimage it is strongly advised to exclude side trips to other countries that might divert one’s attention from the objectives of the pilgrimage. The temptation to take the oppor- tunity to visit other countries along the way, such as Sri Lanka, Nepal or Myanmar, will arise but one should not cut down the duration of the pilgrimage to accommodate these side trips. If the duration is shortened, one tends to rush from place to place, giv - ing rise to impatience and dissatisfaction , which is exactly the opposite of what one wishes to cultivate on a pilgrimage. In order to visit all the principal shrines in the Eight Great Places at a com - fortable pace , it is advised that a minimum of 12 days be reserved for the pilgrimage. A suggested itinerary of 12 days, based on the writer’s experience, is given below. Im p ortant a) On Day 2, from Etawah to Sankasia, use the state highway to Kishni-Bewar-Sankasia. From Sankasia to Kanpur, use the state highway to Chhibramau-Kanpur. b) On Day 10, it is more convenient to travel by train from Patna to Calcutta, which takes 10 hours, compared with 14 hours from Patna to Delhi. c) If the pilgrimage group is travelling with a venerable monk, it is advisable to carry packed lunches always when leaving the hotel in the morning. This will enable the venerable monk to have his meal before noon while on the road. Secondly, it will save a lot of time if members of the group eat at the same time as the venerable monk. Try as far as possible not to have lunch in the hotel, as it is usually not ready , and one has to wait for it to be prepared, thereby losing precious time ."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"136 137 12-Day Itinerary to the Eight Great Places Outbound Flight KL/Delhi, return Flight Calcutta/KL.

Performing Dana or Offerings to the Sangha As D-day, or departure day, approaches the pilgrim will naturally experience great joy and religious excitement at the prospect of actually journeying to the land where the Buddha and the Arahants lived and preached more than 2,500 years ago. For Malaysian Buddhists, who are well known for their generosity , the desire to perform dana will prompt the pilgrims and their well-wishers to donate generously towards the purchase of monks’ requisites for offering to the Buddhist monasteries located in the vicinity of all the holy shrines. Many of the monks in these monasteries, notably those from Sri Lanka and Myanmar , have spent the major part of their lives in India. They are dedicated to the safeguarding of the holy shrines and reviving the traditions of Vaisakha Purnima ( Wesak) and Kathina (robe offering after the rains-retreat) in the land where Buddhism was born but had disappeared for six hun - dred years after its downfall in the 13 th century AD. Their pres - ence at the holy shrines has helped to keep these shrines ‘ alive ’, so that pilgrims who come from far and wide can benefit from their advice and help . By performing dana to these bhikkhus, one expresses one’s gratitude , reverence and loving-kindness to the Sangha, for its role in safeguarding these holy places for future gen - erations of Buddhists to come and “look upon them with feelings of reverence”, in accordance with the Buddha’s advice. For pilgrims travelling in a group, there is less restriction on lug - gage weight during group check-in at the airport. This provides them with the opportunity to bring items such as monks’ robes, towels, medicines, multi-vitamins, writing materials for student- monks, foodstuffs and other requisites not obtainable in India and"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"138 139 offer them to the Sangha. Money remaining after the purchase of requisites may be converted into Indian rupees and placed into the donation boxes of the monasteries during the visits, so that the money may be used for the maintenance of the monasteries and the bhikkhus."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"140 141 4. Information and Tips on Travel in India a) Travel Visas Pilgrims who intend visiting the Buddhist circuit by flight in and out of India should ensure that they hold a multiple entry visa for India. An ordinary tourist visa for single entry will not allow the visitor to re-enter India from Nepal after visiting Lumbini . Nowadays one can apply for both Indian and Nepalese visas in Kuala Lumpur. b) Insurance and Expenses • Pilgrims are advised to insure themselves against loss/sickness/ accident during the journey. • Pilgrims should exercise care and precaution to safeguard their luggage and belongings. They should not bring jewelry, expen - sive watches and other valuables on the journey. • They should keep their passports and cash with them at all times, as the loss of a passport will cause a lot of inconvenience to everyone. • What is the minimum amount of money to bring along? As all expenses for the trip – such as the tour fare, airport taxes, visa fees, entrance fees and tips – have been paid before depar - ture, one need not bring a lot of money for the journey. Overall, US$100 is sufficient to cover all personal expenses such as purchasing souvenirs and donations to the various temples. Of course, one may bring more money if one wishes."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"140 141 c) Health Precautions • To avoid sickness , one should always drink boiled/mineral water and not consume any uncooked food, not even iced drinks , as the ice is made from tap water. Arrangements may be made with the travel agent to provide one bottle of mineral water per day to each pilgrim free of charge. • Inoculation against Cholera: Those who wish to inoculate against cholera should do it 2-3 weeks before departure to avoid developing a fever while travelling. • Medicines: A first aid kit containing normal medicines for cuts, sprains, diarrhea, flu, food poisoning, ointment for insect bites, Panadol for fever, etc. should be brought along to cater for emer - gencies. Costs may be shared by members of the group. d) Things to bring along Important: In view of the strict security checks when boarding an airplane, please ensure that no sharp objects are carried in your hand carry luggage. The following are useful on a short tour: • Torchlight in case of emergency/power failure in the hotel. • Warm clothes for mild winter, e.g. sweater, jacket, pants for ladies. • For shoes, wear walking or jogging shoes and socks. • Umbrella – foldable type for ladies. • Toilet articles, tissues, shampoo, washing powder. • Dry foodstuffs, e.g. biscuits, sweets, coffee or tea sachets, fast- cooking noodles, etc. • It is good to carry multi-vitamins for personal use."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"142 143 e) Donations to Charity Begging appears to be a profession in India and even village chil - dren enjoy begging from visitors at the first opportunity. By giving to one beggar, one will find oneself being swarmed by a crowd of beggars asking for more, and generally making a nuisance of themselves. In giving charity to the poor, it is advisable to give all donations in cash and kind to the monasteries for fair distribu - tion . One may bring ballpoint pens, sweets, old clothes, etc. and donate them to the Maha Bodhi Society branches in Sarnath and Bodhgaya, which provide free education to the poor children in their areas."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"142 143 5.
