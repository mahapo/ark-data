Did you know that Stage Hypnotists are among the highest paid entertainers in the field of show business, now this knowledge and power can be yours. To finish this introductory chapter, allow me to explain that this course has been purposely written in a simple to understand manner with plain language and complicated words and phrases removed. Hypnosis is a much deeper subject than most realise, the majority of the population are of the opinion that all you do is snap your fingers or swing a shiny watch in front of their eyes and then they will just instantly drop off to sleep. Well I can tell you here and now it is a great deal more complicated than that, yet at the same time if you are prepared to believe what I teach you it is also far easier to learn than you might at first imagine. Read, study and absorb the contents of this course, it will without doubt place you on the road to ultimate success in both Stage Hypnosis and Hypnotherapy. That's lesson one by the way, always have 100% confidence in your skills and talents. When you exude this confidence to your audience or client it will make your job of Hypnotising them that much easier. This is because through your body language and other actions including tone of voice etc. you will be transmitting the faith you have in your skills to them and, as such, they will then have total faith and belief in your ability to Hypnotise them also. And if they have faith in you then they will believe you are able to Hypnotise them and if they believe you are able to place them into a trance then you can! Yes that's right. If they believe you have the power to Hypnotise them then you will in turn be able to do so with ease. This manual will set you well on the way to learning more about this amazing art!

However, when a volunteer is in trance, the depth will fluctuate, just so long as they don't drift into the somnambulistic state, then you will be OK. If in this somnambulistic state, they will be so deeply relaxed, that they will not react to your commands and will not be of use to you and your show. There are five states of hypnosis, and these are: THE WAKING STATE (HYPNOIDAL STATE) This is the initial stage of hypnosis that begins the moment you ask them to clasp their hands together. It is a lovely lazy state that we all drift into prior to sleep or, although fully conscious, just before we wake up. Many volunteers will be in the hypnoidal state, but that's OK, as they will be relaxed enough to react to your suggestions, to let the ego be subdued. THE LIGHT TRANCE (LETHARGIC) This is the next level of hypnosis, and in this light trance, as the title suggests, the subjects feel quite lethargic. A flickering of the eyelids is often noticed or a movement of the eyeballs under the lids (known as R.E.M.'s , Rapid Eye Movements). This merely shows that the subject is entering a deeper level of trance. When the subject is in a light trance, it is easy to work with them for the same reasons as when they are in the waking state. THE MEDIUM STATE (CATALEPTIC TRANCE) In this state, the person feels detached from their surroundings and very often has a hazy recollection of events when the hypnotic state is ended. This state causes no problems, as the subject will still respond to your suggestions. In fact, for information purposes, this is the state of trance you'd want a subject in to make their body rigid and support them like a plank of wood across the back of two chairs. Or to move a blow torch across their arm with no pain as will soon be described. DEEP STATE (SOMNAMBULSTIC) This state is an absolute nightmare for you in your role as a hypnotist. The reason for this being, in this state, they will be enjoying hypnosis so much, that they will want to be left alone and will not want to participate. If any subject should enter this state, then they should be awoken as soon as possible! You will find that the term hypnosis is usually spit into 3 categories: 1. Self Hypnosis 2. Hypnotherapy 3. Stage Hypnosis "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Self Hypnosis Self hypnosis is training the ability to hypnotise yourself! This is great to help yourself achieve your goals easier and faster than you ever thought possible! It has been said that all hypnosis is self hypnosis. Hypnotherapy \"It overthrows the theories of judges and philosophers and shakes the faith of material scientists in their preconceived opinions. It replaces the physician and the surgeon, cures the afflicted and the deformed who they pronounced beyond the hope of recovery. It breaks the chains of demoralising and destructive habits. It comforts the sorrowing and brings peace of mind to those distracted by the perplexities of life. It abolishes periods of time and extents of distance. It makes the lame walk, strengthens the weak and causes the maniac to become as docile as a baby. It cheats the hand of death and snatches almost from the grave the grim destroyer's victims. It loosens the tongue of the stammer, overcomes the self-consciousness of the backward and tempers the impetuosity of the rash enthusiast. To mankind it is a blessing, leading their innermost thoughts to higher and nobler things, developing their powers to plan and to execute and giving them social, financial and intellectual eminence among his fellow men. All this and more is HYPNOTISM.\" Stage Hypnosis As I see it the human mind is made up of three separate layers making the whole, these three layers are as follows: 1) The conscious mind and/or human will. 2) The analytical and/or critical area. 3) The subconscious and/or imagination We use the conscious mind to speak etc, the subconscious deals with the automatic actions of our blood circulation and breathing as well as being our imagination area of the mind. And lastly the analytical area analyses all incoming information before being allowed entry and storage in the subconscious mind as truth/fact. I will now make the analogy of the mind being a computer. The conscious mind is if you like the keyboard, which inputs new information. The analytical area analyses it for any mistakes in much the same way as a spell checker, then the \"corrected\" data, if of an acceptable nature, is allowed to enter the subconscious mind where it is stored forever in much the same way as storing data onto a floppy disc. To briefly explain if you told a fully conscious person that when you snapped your fingers they are Elvis and then snapped same said fingers, they would not react! Why? Well simply because the analytical area processes it and then compares it with the memory bank record in the subjects subconscious mind of who they are before rejecting it as it realises the statement to be untrue. All this of course takes only a fraction of a second to occur. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Under Stage Hypnosis the mind and body of the subject relax, and due to the disorientation, confusion and repetition of suggestion the analytical area shuts down or goes to sleep. As such when told that on a snap of the fingers they will be Elvis the mind is then unable to process the information and find out that it is untrue and consequently it is believed to be true. It goes directly into the subconscious as being true and so is acted upon as an automatic reflex action. If only in a very light state of trance the will of the person may still go into conflict with the imagination or subconscious, but as we stated earlier when the imagination and will are in conflict the imagination always wins. As such they will react and be Elvis or do whatever you have suggested without question. Just as with any computer, programs placed into the memory which in the long term could be dangerous or more harm than good MUST be cancelled out or erased so that things revert to normality. So it is also with your subjects mind, all suggestions must be completely cancelled out before they leave the venue after the Hypnotic show. The final key to a most successful induction is as follows. The Hypnotist suggests things to the subject who in turn accepts and reacts to these verbal suggestions. The Hypnotist then observes the effects of those suggestions and feeds back his observations as new suggestions to the subject. The subject accepts and reacts to these, the Hypnotist observes the effects and then feeds back the observations as new suggestions to the subjects and so the Biofeedback computer effect continues until the subject is in a deep state of trance. In other words the Hypnotist's suggestions are always made up of his observations.  "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Self Hypnosis: Before you start to practise stage hypnotism it is a good idea to understand the feeling associated with hypnosis and self-hypnosis. We encourage all course participants to attempt self hypnosis before them come on the Stage Hypnotist course. For those with little knowledge on self-hypnosis the following is designed to give some insight and to guide you through a technique that will allow you to enter the hypnotic state. It has been maintained that all hypnosis is essentially self-hypnosis. It is certainly impossible to be hypnotised by someone else unless you want or allow it to happen. Once you have learned how to hypnotise yourself, practice will enable you to put yourself in a 'trance' whenever you wish to, quickly and easily. Psychotic and severely mentally unstable people, however, should never attempt self-hypnosis. The most effective way of learning self-hypnosis is to have a qualified hypnotherapist teach you, they can give you post-hypnotic suggestions that will help you enter the state easier. Besides that, you need to know what to do when you get into trance.... Hypnosis is an extremely powerful tool that can make big changes in your life when used properly. You may own a set of wrenches but they are useless to fix your car unless you have an understanding of mechanics and know what you are doing. So here we go, I will guide you through a simple technique of self-hypnosis. Like any thing it doesn't always happen for you first time. It may take a little practise but the rewards for you efforts will be immense.  "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"A Simple Self-Hypnosis Method An \"altered state\" of consciousness occurs when you process information outside of your primary representational system. Hypnosis is a state of concentrated, focused attention. Going into hypnosis involves turning your attention away from external experience and directing it internally. Understanding by the conscious mind is not necessary for the change to occur. Let's consider these ideas one at a time. Representational Systems and Altered States We process information (that is, we think) in pictures, sounds and feelings. In Neurolinguistic Programming, these sensory modalities are referred to as representational systems. The Visual System - The external things we see and the internal images that we create. This includes remembered images (\"What does the White House look like?\"), constructed images (\"What would it look like if it were painted with red and yellow stripes?\"), as well as \"live\" things we see about us. The Auditory System - The external things we hear, the internal sounds that we create. This includes remembered words or sounds, imagined words or sounds, \"Self Talk\", etc. as well as all of the \"live\" sounds around us. The Kinaesthetic System - The things we feel. These can be actual physical sensations or imagined ones. Can you imagine being on a beach and feeling sand between you toes? Most of us have developed greater proficiency with one or the other of our representational systems though we each use all three of them. Since this is the case, an individual who \"thinks\" in images wouldn't experience an altered state of consciousness simply by visualising. However, if that same individual were to experience a preponderance of feelings or sensations, this would be unusual - an alteration of their state of consciousness. When we talk about altered states, what we're really referring to is processing information in a different manner than usual. Focused Attention Stereotypical images of hypnotists holding watches or other fixation devices for clients to stare at are the result of this understanding about hypnosis. If you've ever had the experience of becoming so involved in television or a piece of music or a book, you've experienced this \"naturally occurring hypnotic state\". \"Going Inside\" The experience of hypnosis is typically an inwardly focused one in which we move away from the environment around us and turn our attention inward. You can Trust your Unconscious Mind "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Self Hypnosis Technique 1. Find a Comfortable Position - Get a position that you will be able to maintain easily for the time you are going to be doing this process. It can be sitting or lying down, though sitting is recommended to prevent you from falling asleep. Get yourself centred, just looking in front of you and breathing slowly and easily. Let yourself relax. 2. Time - Determine the length of time that you intend to spend and make a statement to yourself about it such as \"I am going into self hypnosis for 20 minutes ... \" (or however long you want) You will be delighted to discover how well you \"internal clock\" can keep track of the time for you. 3. Purpose - Make a second statement to yourself about your purpose in going into self-hypnosis. In this process, we allow the unconscious mind to work on the issue rather than giving suggestions throughout, so our purpose statement should reflect that fact. Here's how I say it: \"... for the purpose of allowing my unconscious mind to make the adjustments that are appropriate to assist me in _____________ \". Filling in the blank with what you want to achieve such as \"developing more confidence in social situations. The actual words aren't nearly as important as the fact your statement acknowledges that you are turning this process over to your unconscious mind. 4. Exit State - Make a final statement to yourself about the state that you want to be in when you complete the process. Typically in hypnosis, we have heard the idea that you should come back feeling \"wide awake, alert and refreshed\", but in the real world that may not be what you want. For example, if you are doing your self-hypnosis before bedtime, you may prefer to come out of it \"relaxed and ready for sleep\". If you're doing it before some project you may want to come out \"motivated and full of energy\". Simply say to yourself, \"... and when I'm finished, I'm going to feel __________\". 5. The Process - Looking in front of you, notice three things (one at a time) that you see. Go slowly, pausing for a moment on each. It is preferable that they be small things, such as a spot on the wall, a doorknob, the corner of a picture frame, etc. Some people like to name the items as they look at them - \"I see the hinge on the door frame\". (If you don't know the name for the thing, try \"I see that thing over there\"). Now turn your attention to your auditory channel and notice, one by one, three things that you hear. (You will notice that this allows you to incorporate sounds that occur in the environment rather than being distracted by them. Next, attend to your feeling and notice three things-sensations that you can feel. Again, go slowly from one to the next. It's useful to use sensations that normally are outside of your awareness, such as the weight of your eyeglasses, the feeling of your wristwatch, the texture of your shirt, etc. Continue the process"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"using two Visuals, then two auditories and then two kinaesthetic. In the same manner, continue (slowly) with one of each. You have now completed the \"external\" portion of the process. Now it's time to begin the \"internal\" part. Close your eyes. Bring an image into your mind. Don't work too hard at this. You can construct an image or simply take what comes. It may be a point of light, it may be a beautiful beach, or it could be a pizza. If something comes to you just use it. If nothing comes, feel free to \"put something there\". Name it as you did above. Pause and let a sound come into your awareness or generate one and name it. Although this is technically the internal part, if you should hear a sound outside or in the room with you, it's OK to use that. Remember that the idea is to incorporate things that you experience rather than being distracted by them. Next, become aware of a feeling and name it. It's preferable to do this internally - use your imagination. (I feel the warmth of the summer sun on my arms) However, as with the auditory, if you actually have a physical sensation that gets your attention, use that. Repeat the process with two images, then two sounds, then two feelings. Repeat the cycle once again using three images, three sounds, and three feelings. 6.Completing the Process - It is not unusual to \"space out\" or lose consciousness during the process. At first some people think that they've fallen asleep. But generally you will find yourself coming back automatically at the end of the allotted time. This is an indication that you weren't sleeping and that your unconscious mind was doing what you asked of it. Note: Most people don't get all the way through the process. That's perfectly all right. If you should complete the process before the time has ended, just continue with 4 images, sounds, feelings, then 5 and so on. As for your goals, trust that your unconscious mind is working for you \"in the background\" while you're doing the process. This process is not easy and it may take several attempts to achieve any kind of success. Stick with the process and practise it as often as possible. Once you have mastered how you are able to quieten the mind you can start to understand the processes of hypnosis easier and quicker and develop yourself the way you want to be. You may find it easier to listen to a hypnotic cassettes during this process to help you achieve the trance state quicker and easier.

Mozart (1756-91) apparently composed the famous opera Cosi fan tutte while hypnotised. Rachmaninov (1873-1943) reputedly composed one of his concertos following a posthypnotic suggestion. Goethe (1749-1832) writer and scientist and, Chopin (1810-1849) pianist and composer both took classes in hypnosis at the University of Strasbourg.

Sir Winston Churchill (1874-1965) politician counted backwards in 3s in order to stay awake all night and avoid tiredness during W.W.II. Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud developed modern psychiatry as a result of learning about (and practising) hypnosis. Louis XVI of France appointed a committee of investigate the healing powers of ‘mesmerism’.

"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Stage Hypnosis: In this part I will reveal some of the key secrets of Hypnosis. In other words, within the next few pages you will find information you require to become a professional Stage Hypnotist. However as you will have, I presume, no previous knowledge of the subjects in hand you may think that the next few pages over simplify the art. The idea of this however is to show you the key points and then to explain to you why these are the key points. As you read this part of the manual you will then realise and more importantly understand just how easy and simple it really is to hypnotise someone. STAGE HYPNOTISM Boiled down to the basics, Stage Hypnosis is IDENTICAL to all other forms of Hypnosis. The only difference being the way in which it is PRESENTED and the speed at which the volunteers are placed into a DEEP hypnotic trance state. There are seven key points to follow for Hypnotherapy Hypnosis and below I shall explain how these key points also apply to the use of Hypnotism on stage. SEVEN STEPS TO HYPNOTHERAPY 1) Introductory talk to the client in order to obtain \"rapport.\" 2) Induction of the hypnotic trance state. 3) Deepening of the trance state. 4) Ego-strengthening Therapy. 5) Carry out the necessary Therapy on the client. 6) Implant the major post Hypnotic suggestion. 7) Awaken the client from the Hypnotic trance state. SEVEN STEPS TO STAGE-HYPNOSIS 1) Obtain rapport (done through one liner jokes at start of act). 2) Induction of Hypnotic trance. 3) Deepening of trance (giving suggestion that each time they are told to return to sleep they will go deeper.) 4) Ego strengthening Therapy (butter them up/compliments etc). 5) Do the Therapy (in this case the comedy routines of your act). 6) Implant the major post Hypnotic suggestion. (N.B. This is done at stage two when they are told that when you tell them to return to sleep they will go deeper and is done so that all suggestions given to them are cancelled before they leave the stage). 7) Awaken them from trance (awaken them and ensure they feel strong and confident). So you see, the basic structure is the same. In fact to be honest the best piece of advice I could ever give you is to go and see a Stage Hypnotist performing when they are in your area. Study them and also consult a Hypnotherapist and then you will see with your own eyes just how similar the two forms of Hypnosis really are."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"This will also be a most valuable learning experience as you can learn an awful lot by emulating (not copying) the style and manner of established experienced Stage Hypnotists. Basically speaking if you did what they did word for word and with similar actions on someone whom had been made to believe in your abilities then they may go into a trance state and react to your various suggestions. THE SECRET TO HYPNOTIC INDUCTIONS When wishing to place someone into a Hypnotic trance there is also a set procedure to follow which is: A) BELIEF and EXPECTANCY B) DISORIENTATION and CONFUSION C) SUGGESTION and REPETITION D) RELAXATION and SLEEP Step A means that if you instill into them a belief in your powers as a Hypnotist and as such they believe that you are able to place them under trance, and they also expect to go under if you were to try it upon them, then they are in the correct state of mind to be very successfully and rapidly placed into a Hypnotic trance state. Step B means that once they are in the correct state of mind to be Hypnotised you then use methods of disorientation and confusion to convince them they are starting to go into trance, and that's why they are feeling these strange effects. As such if they believe this to be the case then they will expect to go under deeper and as such they will, as in the end its all down to their personal state of mind. Step C means that once these things are starting to convince them they are beginning to slip into trance then you use methods of suggestion and repetition to confuse and disorientate them even further and also to convince them that they are going under more. If they believe this is the case and expect what you are doing to have an effect upon them, then indeed, in turn it most certainly will. Step D is the end result of carrying out steps A, B & C and should be that if they believe what you have done to be Hypnosis and expect it to work then this will have the result of relaxation and sleep. And as all Hypnosis really is, is deep relaxation they will then be in the Hypnotic trance state. So you see the secret to all induction's of any kind whether Stage or Therapy and whether slow, rapid or instantaneous is that if the subject sincerely believes that what you are doing does work and they also sincerely believe and expect it to work on them, then the end result will always be that it works on them. Basically, the key secret to all induction's is to have instilled into the prospective subjects mind, the belief in your powers and the 100% expectancy that should you as the worlds greatest of great Stage and/or Therapeutic Hypnotists picks upon them to be Hypnotised then it will work and as such they will enter a trance. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Hypnotic Tapes and CD’s: How many times have you wished you were different ... slimmer, healthier, happier, friendlier, self-confident, more creative, wealthier or free from bad habits such as smoking or drinking? If you have wished for this change, why haven't you achieved it? After all, common sense tells us that if you eat less, you'll lose weight; and to make friends, you must be interested in other people. As for smoking and drinking, simply apply will-power ... just say, \"NO!\" If it were only as easy as that! Unfortunately, there is a force in the human mind that thwarts our will power. The existence of such a force has been talked about for thousands of years, but it was not until the 19th century that Dr. Sigmund Freud was able to prove what others had only suspected ... the existence of a \"second mind.\" This second mind, or \"subconscious,\" as Freud called it, holds absolute control over much of our lives, our actions, habits, likes, dislikes, health, success and failure. \"More complex than a modern computer.\" The subconscious is a magnificent work of the universe - more complex than a modern computer - and hundreds of times more efficient. It oversees the operation of our whole body, right down to each individual cell. Psychologists tell us the subconscious may account for as much as 90-95% of our brain power. Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to reach the subconscious by using reason. It resists any direct efforts on the part of conscious mind to control it. A good example of this uncooperative behaviour is often apparent when we try to use our memory. Memory is in the realm of the subconscious, which has stored away in its endless files, everything we have seen, heard or sensed since the moment we were born. However, it is willing to release only a tiny fraction of these stored memories to the conscious mind. Sometimes, it refuses even this tiny bit! You've experienced this problem, I'm sure, you try to recall a word, a number, or a name. It's right on the tip of your tongue, but the harder you try to remember, the further it retreats into the inaccessible reaches of your subconscious. So, you finally give up. You stop trying to coax it out. You turn your thoughts to other things and what happens? The elusive information pops unexpectedly into your conscious mind. Obviously, the subconscious doesn't respond well to commands, coaxing, or concentration. It prefers the oblique approach. Although its capability is unlimited, the subconscious lacks one important attribute of the conscious mind; it is unable to make judgments. I cannot distinguish between right and wrong, good and bad, true and false. When programmed, the subconscious mind creates automatically according to the information it has received. When your subconscious programming is positive, your life is positive. When your subconscious programming is negative, your life is negative. If your mind is filled with fears, anger, jealousy, hate, pain, and limitations of every description, so is your life. If your mind is filled with joy, love, and light, your life is pleasurable, peaceful and prosperous. It is your mind and you are responsible for programming"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"it. Negative programming is why we eat too much when our thinking mind tells us to reduce. Our parents made us clean up the plate, and we continue to smoke when we know we should stop. As teenagers, we thought smoking was sophisticated. T hat is why we lose friends, argue, develop ulcers, have high blood pressure, lie awake, have sexual problems, underachieve, get fired, and fail to achieve the success we deserve. \"Each tape is carefully designed to accomplish the benefit you want, the sooner you begin, the sooner you start enjoying a more fulfilling life.\" The British Academy of Hypnosis has it's own tried and tested range of hypnotic audio programs.
