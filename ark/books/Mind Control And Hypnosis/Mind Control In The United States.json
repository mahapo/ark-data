Introduction The most effective way to protect yourself from sub conscious manipulation is to be aware of how it works. Steven Jacobson, author of Mind Control in the Unit ed States, is a film technician experienced in subliminal techniques use d in the communication media. Subliminal perception is a process, a deliberate pr ocess created by communications technicians, by which you receive an d respond to information and instructions without being consciou sly aware of the instructions. Scary? You bet your life it is. And as Jacobson det ails in this book it is happening in America today. Mind Control in the United States is an introductio n to the history and practice of subliminal communication. It outlines t he principles of mental programming, i.e., that an initial distraction must be followed by repetitive commands, and it tells you how these ideas are impl emented. Further, the book tells you when and where it has b een used. Jacobson's examples range from In Flight Motion Pictures, Inc. and its on-board films to general audience movies such as Reefer Madness, The Exorcist, and My World Dies Screaming. The effects on audiences are graphically described. The case of the movie The Exorcist is specially int eresting. William Peter Blatty, author of the book and producer of the movi e, is a former CIA operative. Blatty had an extensive career in govern ment psychological manipulations. One has to be pretty naive to argue there is no connection between Blatty's CIA career and his choice of commu nications techniques. 1"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Similarly, subliminal techniques have been used on radio and television. Current research has moved heavily into extra senso ry perception (ESP), the use of meditation, and marijuana to generate altere d states of consciousness. Out-of-body experiences are apparently better docum ented as research has progressed far beyond general belief. Just who is responsible for this intrusive experime ntation with free individuals in a free society? Author Jacobson presents example after example iden tifying the so-called Eastern Establishment, that coterie made up of the Council of Foreign Relations, the Bilderbergers, and other assorted el itists as the primary source. Even at the White House level, deception wa s practiced not only by that master deceiver, Richard Nixon, but also by Pr esidents Johnson, Carter, and Reagan. At the corporate level every large adve rtising agency has experimented with subliminal manipulation. Finally, deception has been used to disguise the pe rvasive erosion of our constitutionally guaranteed freedoms. Unfortunately for us, George Orwell's 1984 was righ t on schedule. What is alarming is that very, very few citizens realize th at deception is already part of the social framework. We don't know that 1984 ha s already arrived because we have been conditioned not to know. By the same means, the media has created a state of inner turmoil in citizens through portrayal of violence and chaos and irratio nal behavior. This inner state is reflected in the chaotic world outside. What can you do? Hopefully this book will increase your sense of skepticism when it comes to the establishment and i ts representatives. Less obviously, you do have a duty to freedom to find th e truth and spread the truth. Mind Control in the United States will be invaluabl e in this task. At least you will know who tried to brainwash you and how th ey tried. ANTONY C. SUTTON California, 1985 2"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"2. Nineteen Eighty-Four In the book 1984, George Orwell warns that people a re in danger of losing their human qualities and freedom of mind without b eing aware of it while it is happening because of psychological engineering. We have learned to expect the Soviet Union and the People's Republic o f China to use \"mind control\" on its citizens, but not the \"free world.\" Nevertheless, the same techniques are being used in the United States. The most effective way to protect yourself from subconscious manipulation is by being aware of how it works. The techniques used to enslave the mind a re the same used to free it. 3. Principles of Mental Programming The most effective way to conquer a man is to captu re his mind. Control a man's mind and you control his body. Most people do n't pay conscious attention to the things that affect them subconscio usly. They don't usually know what to look for. However, when pointed to, th ese things can be recognized and understood. The principles of mind control, hypnotic suggestion and, mental programming are ancient (the term used doesn't matt er, the principles remain 3"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the same). The goal is to suspend the thought proce sses of the conscious mind to cause a state of mind that is just like \"da y dreaming.\" Stop conscious thought and the mind is in its most sugge stible state and is more receptive to programming than at any other time. Th erefore, the first principle of mind control is distraction. Distracti on focuses the attention of the conscious mind on one or more of the five sense s (sight, sound, touch, smell and taste) in order to program the subconscio us mind. All men do not think the same thoughts, but all men think with the same mechanism-the brain. One part of the brain works th ings out one step at a time just like a computer. This is the language-usi ng left side of the brain which is also identified as the conscious mind. The tools of the conscious mind are words (spoken, written and thought) and pi ctures and sounds. The conscious mind discriminates, evaluates, accepts or rejects. Sometimes the more you think about a problem, the further you get from finding a solution to it. When this happens, you make decisions based on how you feel. \"I didn't arrive at my understanding of the fundamenta l laws of the universe through my rational mind,\" said Albert Einstein. 1 The powers of intuition are the powers of the subconscious mind. The right side of the brain is the center of intuition, creativity, emotion. 2 \"Use the force, Luke. The force is an energyfield c reated by all living things. Trust your feelings, not the computer.\" The force i n Star Wars is Hollywood's version of an ancient principle. Think of your subconscious mind as your link with \"the force.\" Also think of y our subconscious mind as your own personal energy source. Now imagine you r conscious thoughts directing this energy source and drawing power from \"the force.\" This is the relationship of the conscious mind to the subconsci ous. What the conscious mind believes, the subconscious acts on. It works l ike programming a computer. You feed information into a computer, and the computer acts on it. However, if the information you feed into the c omputer is wrong, it still acts on it! If you give yourself incorrect informat ion or if others give you incorrect information, the memory banks of your sub conscious mind do not correct the error but act on it! When you stop conscious thinking and make your mind go blank, then your mind is in its most suggestible state. It is in thi s state of mind where you are the most receptive to mental programming. This state of mind is just like \"day dreaming.\" Now remember the first princip le behind mental programming. That principle is distraction. Distrac tion focuses the attention of the conscious mind on one or more of the five se nses in order to program 4"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the subconscious mind. The same principle applies t o all illusion, magic and propaganda. The second principle of mental programming is repet ition. Distraction and repetition represent the learning process. Picture yourself studying in school. You are reading a book. Your eyes are focus ed on the page of the book. The words on the page are the conscious distr action for your eyes. The information you are reading is being programmed directly to your subconscious mind. You are not consciously analyzin g the material you are reading until you look away from the page and think about it. It is at this point you have the opportunity to analyze the infor mation you have just read and accept it as true or reject it as false. I f you accept the information as true, it is programmed that way to your subconsciou s mind. If you reject the information as false, that is programmed to your su bconscious mind. However, if you don't know if the information is tr ue or not, a curious thing happens. Your trust in the source of the info rmation determines whether or not you accept the information. If you d o not believe that a book could contain information that was false (unintenti onally or intentionally), then you would accept its information as true even if you weren't sure or didn't understand it. This is especially true in sc hool where there is pressure to accept what is presented as true because that is what is expected and that determines your grade and your future. Repetition o f the information imbeds it in your subconscious mind so that your acceptanc e of its truth (accuracy) becomes a conditioned response. You accept this inf ormation as true without thinking whenever it is presented to you ag ain. 4. The Power of Music Think back to a time when you have been saddened by a song. It may have brought a tear. You might have felt it in your stom ach as a change in muscle tension. The power of music has been recogni zed throughout history. Plato and Aristotle believed that people c ould be controlled by music. It affects your body, your mind and your emo tions. Sound causes 5"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"changes in your body chemistry, blood pressure, bre aming and digestion. Even sound that you cannot hear affects you. Low fr equency \"infrasonic\" sounds affect your internal organs and can cause he adaches, nausea, dizziness and fatigue. Fast music will speed up the nervous s ystem while slow music will slow it down. Your entire body is sensitive to sound. Sounds vibrate in different parts of the body. Low tones will vibrate in the lower parts of your body, and high tones will vibrate in the higher por tions and on into the head. 3 Sixties rock superstar Jimi Hendrix said: \"You can hypnotize people with music, and when you get them at their weakest point you can preach into their subconscious whatever you want to say.\" 4 Much of today's popular rock music is built around a heavy bass pattern lou der than the melody. These loud, low frequency vibrations and the drivin g beat of most rock music affect the pituitary gland. The pituitary gla nd produces hormones mat control the sexual responses of males and females. 5 These low frequency vibrations vibrate in the lower parts of your body so that the music \"feels\" good. It is important to note that the lyrics of many roc k songs are not clearly distinguishable consciously. Now remember your subc onscious mind hears all. Repetition of the message is mental programmin g. Research indicates that repeated hearings, whether sought out or not, yield acceptance and even liking. 6 When you do not hear the message clearly, you cann ot make the conscious choice to accept or reject it. When you c annot make that choice or when that choice is taken away from you, the messag e is programmed directly to your subconscious mind without your kno wing it, thus circumventing analysis and choice in accepting the content of the message. In time the effects of this kind of programming wil l appear. These effects can be physical, psychological and emotional. Most people don't pay conscious attention to the things that affect them subconsciously because they don't know what to look for. However, when poi nted to, these things are recognized and understood. It has been well-established by research that the s ubconscious mind is capable of reading mirror images, even upside-down mirror images. 7 This also applies to words spoken or sung backwards. Thi s phenomenon is called backward masking. 8 The Beatles started using backward masking on thei r White Album with the song \"Revolution Number Nine.\" The song repeatedly says, \"number nine, number nine.\" Played backwards it becomes \"turn me on, dead man.\" 9 Rumors swept the world, \"Paul is Dead!\" Material 6"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"on Paul's death was embedded in the Magical Mystery Tour album in the last few grooves of the song \"Strawberry Fields.\" A low volume voice says, \"I buried Paul.\" 10 Two thousand years ago, Plato demanded strict censo rship over popular music in his Utopian Republic. 11 In Nazi Germany, the government used music to create a state of mind in the German peopl e. 12 In the Soviet Union, a state commission determines the kind of mu sic to be heard. If music is such a powerful tool for control in the So viet Union, it can be used in the same way in the United States and the r est of the world. Ayotollah Khomeini, leader of Iran, placed tight co ntrols on music broadcasting and banned certain types of music as a threat to his rule. 13 In Orwell's 1984, music is tightly controlled because of its power to communicate and influence human behavior. 5. TV, Radio and Movies Watching television often creates an altered state of consciousness, because the television screen, while appearing static, actu ally flickers. What causes you to go into an altered state? In hypnosis, it is actually body relaxation and a carefully patterned voice roll. The hypnotist speaks with a regular beat, as if matching his words to a metronome. 14 In fact, any repeating light or sound pattern can lead you into the hypnotic sta te of mind—a state of mind mat is just like \"day dreaming.\" This is an al tered state of consciousness. Think of the times you have caught y ourself staring blankly at the television screen, losing all sense of time and place. When you stop conscious thinking and your mind goes blank, then y our mind is in its most suggestible state. It is in this state of mind wher e you are the most receptive to mental programming. Think of the many times you have seen flashing words in both local and national TV commercials. Th e flashing words are the conscious distraction for the eyes. While the e yes are being occupied, the message being spoken is programmed directly to your subconscious mind. Anything consciously perceived can be evaluated, cr iticized, discussed, 7"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"argued, and possibly rejected. Any information prog rammed subliminally to your subconscious mind meets no resistance. This su bliminal information is stored in your brain with an identification that will trigger a delayed alarm clock-reaction capable of influencing your behavior . 15 On June 22, 1956, the British Broadcasting Corporat ion experimented with projecting subliminal images on television. Picture s were flashed on the screen too quickly to be seen consciously, but they did make an impression on the subconscious. 16 Subliminal perception is the process whereby you receive and respond to visual and sound information without being aware of it. 17 The message, in the form of printed words, picture s or voices, is presented either so rapidly or so faintly that you are not consciously aware of having seen or heard anything. 18 The BBC experiment was followed by an experiment by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporat ion doing the same thing: projecting subliminal images. 19 Mexico's Televisa commercial TV and radio network has experimented extensively with subliminal broadcast techniques. 20 In the U.S., TV station WTWO in Bangor, Maine cond ucted an experiment in November, 1957. 21 Experiments were not limited to television. In 1958 , radio station WAAF in Chicago broadcast \"subaudible\" commercials. Seattle 's KOL broadcast hardly audible taped messages \"below\" the music played by its disc jockeys. \"How about a cup of coffee?\" was one, and \"Someone's at the door\" was another. Marketing researcher and psychologist James Vicary tested subliminal ads in a New Jersey movie theatre. \"Hungry? Eat Popcorn\" a nd \"Drink Coca- Cola\" were flashed on the screen at 1/3000 of a sec ond every five seconds during the movie. Sales increased for popcorn and C oca-Cola. 22 On December 8, 1972, The New York Times reported that In-Flight Motion Pictures, Inc. would begin selling subliminal comme rcials embedded in the movies they would distribute to all the major airli nes. 23 Stores across the country are reducing theft an average 30 to 50 perc ent by broadcasting subliminal messages such as \"I will not steal.\" 24 Stimutech, Inc. of East Lansing, Michigan markets a computer video system t hat flashes subliminal messages on your television while you watch the reg ular programming. The subliminal messages are prepared by a team of psych ologists to change the thinking patterns and behavior of the viewer. 25 Using what was called the Precon Process, the pictu re of a skull and the word BLOOD were flashed subliminally on the screen in the movie My World Dies Screaming. Some words and images trigger strong emotional responses in people. Laboratory experiments show th at people will react to 8"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"words like BLOOD and to pictures of skulls with qui ckened pulse, faster breaming, sweating palms and other indications of h eightened emotions. 26 The Exorcist used both subliminal sounds and pictur es. A number of times during the movie, the face of Father Karras became a two-frame, full-screen death mask. Twenty-four frames of motion picture fi lm are projected per second. The death mask flashed on the screen at 1/4 8 of a second. 27 The consciously unnoticed word PIG appears many time th roughout the movie. 28 The terrified squealing of pigs being slaughtered was mixed subtly into the sound track. 29 The buzzing sound of angry, agitated bees wove in and out of scenes throughout the film. 30 People really did faint in large numbers, many more became nauseous in varying degre es, a great many more had disturbing nightmares. 31 It is interesting to note that William Peter Blatty, the author of the novel and producer of the movie, is a former CIA operative who served as the policy-branch chief of the Psychological Warfare Division of the U.S. Air Force. 32 According to previously classified documents, the CIA tested subliminal manipulation i n movie theatres during the late 1950s. 33 The Bruce Lee \"Kung-Fu\" movie Game of Death illustr ates how easy it is to manipulate what the audience thinks. Bruce Lee i s billed as the star, but an actor impersonates him throughout the movie. Sel ective camera angles attempt to hide this. Close-ups of Lee from other m ovies are used to give the impression that Lee himself appears throughout the story. The difference in the background of these close-ups and changes in color give away the technique. This movie was put togemer with skillful editing to lead up to the climactic fight sequences that were shot with B ruce Lee. \"The foundation of film art is editing,\" wrote Russ ian film director Pudovkin in the preface of the German edition of hi s book on film techniques. In an experiment at the Moscow Film Sch ool, Lev Kuleshov created me impression of a single actress by joinin g the face of one woman, the torso of another, the hands of another, the leg s of yet another. An anonymous British film technician is quoted in a fr ont-page article in the London Tribune , August 5, 1949 saying: \"We claim t hat with judicious cutting and an adroit use of camera angles, it is s imple to make a fool of anybody. We can distort the emphasis and meaning of Ministers' speeches not only by cutting out statements but by simple us e of long shot, medium shot, and close-up. For any statement said in close -up is given greater significance on the screen than one said in long sh ot. There is no end to the tricks we can play with mis simple device.\" 34 9"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Some of the most spectacular footage of the San Fra ncisco earthquake and fire in 1906 was faked. Newsreel companies often st aged events. During the Mexican Revolution in 1914, they made arrangements with Pancho Villa to fight his battles in daylight and to wait until the cameras were in place before launching his attack. Much of the newsreel c overage of World War I was faked. Literary Digest printed an expose in its November 13, 1915 issue. The practice of faking scenes of celebrities by employing impersonators was frequendy used by The March of Ti me screen magazine. Known instances of content manufacture, re-creation , personality impersonation are documented by Raymond Fielding in The American Newsreel. On October 30, 1938 the planet earth was invaded by men from Mars. . . not really, but many people thought so. THE NEW YORK TIMES, Monday, October 31, 1938: A wave of mass hysteria seized thousands of radio l isteners throughout the nation between 8:15 and 9:30 o'clock last night when a broadcast of a dramatization of H. G. Wells' s fantasy, The War of the Worlds, led thousands to believe tha t an interplanetary conflict had started with invading M artians spreading wide death and destruction in New Jersey and New York. \"... we are ready to believe almost anything if it comes from a recognized authority,\" writes Howard Koch in his bo ok The Panic Broadcast. Koch wrote the radio script perfor med by Orson Welles and his Mercury Theatre on CBS. Thousa nds fled from a crisis that had no existence except in their imaginations. 10"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"6. Hypnosis and \"Reefer Madness\" The power of hypnosis is the power of suggestion. T he power of suggestion is the power of belief. It is an act of faith. The conscious mind cannot be controlled by the suggestions of someone else when those suggestions are contrary to what you know from your own experience. But the subconscious mind is susceptible to control by suggestion. 35 The subconscious mind has absolute control of the functions, conditions, and sensations of the body. Perfect anesthesia can be produced by suggestion. H undreds of cases are recorded where surgical operations have been perfor med without pain to patients under hypnosis. Symptoms of almost any dis ease can be induced in hypnotic subjects by suggestions. Partial or total paralysis can be produced; fever can be brought on, with all the attendant sym ptoms such as rapid pulse and high temperature. 36 In 1936, a movie used hypnotic suggestion to give t he audience instructions to do something. That movie was Reefer Madness. Sho wn widely on college campuses and at midnight screenings across the country since 1972, Reefer Madness uses sophisticated hypnotic techniqu es to both encourage marijuana use and promote anti-marijuana legislatio n. Speaking to a PTA meeting, high school principal Dr . Carroll commands parents to stamp out this \"assassin of our youth\"-m arijuana. When Dr. Carroll begins to speak, he raises a sheet of paper in front of him and reads certain \"facts\" from it. The white sheet of paper p rominent in the middle of the screen is a distraction for the eyes to cause t hat state of mind that is just like \"day dreaming\" while information is programmed to the audience verbally. Dr. James Braid discovered that by placin g a bright object before the eyes of the subject, and causing him to gaze up on it with persistent attention, he could be led into the hypnotic state of mind. 37 Dr. Carroll 11"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"delivers his lines with a hypnotic rhythm that is p unctuated by changes in pacing, volume and tone (just like a hypnotist). Dr . Carroll speaks with authority. This happens to be a technique used in h ypnosis. Authoritarian techniques, sometimes called paternal techniques, u se a strong, commanding, dominating approach. 38 Dr. Carroll looks into the camera and into the eyes of the audience-another hypnotic tech nique. Picture yourself in a movie theatre, now imagine a huge face on the scr een staring at you. Other hypnotic techniques used in Reefer Madness in clude two-frame flashes in different places in the movie. These flash frame s produce a corresponding wave in the brain. These flash frames \"anchor\" info rmation from the sound track to your mind. These flash frames add emphasis to information on the sound track, making that information more important . Dr. Carroll slams his fist on the desk frequently to emphasize a point. T his sudden burst of sound \"anchors\" information to your mind. The added sound cue makes the information important. There is even a scene with a swinging hypnotic pendulum! The stated intent of Reefer Madness was to stamp ou t the menace of marijuana because it leads to \"acts of shocking vio lence, ending often in incurable insanity.\" In contrast, young people are shown having a good time smoking marijuana, partying, dancing, kissing and r etreating to the bedroom. By showing young people having a good time smoking marijuana, Reefer Madness encourages young people t o at least try it. By confusing marijuana with heroin and by telling the story of normal kids going berserk because of marijuana, Reefer Madness scares older people into demanding that something be done. Why are ther e conflicting messages in the movie? Why was hypnosis used in this movie a nd with such a high level of sophistication? The answers are within the movie. \"You government men have got to find some way to pu t an end to it,\" demands Dr. Carroll. The government man replies: \"O f course, I agree with you Dr. Carroll. But do you realize that marihuana is not like other forms of DOPE. You see, it grows wild in almost every state of the union. Therefore, there is practically no inter-state comm erce in the drug. As a result, the government's hands are tied. And frankl y, the only sure cure is a wide-spread campaign in education.\" Some words trig ger strong emotional responses in people. The word DOPE is one of them. This word is emphasized on the sound track. Though we are told t hat marijuana is not like other forms of \"dope,\" the association is esta blished. 12"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Harry Anslinger was the first U.S. Commissioner of Narcotics, a position he held for 32 years; and was U.S. Representative o n the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs. In his book The Murde rers, he wrote about his campaign against marijuana: \"By 1937, und er my direction, the bureau launched two important steps: first, a legis lative plan to seek from Congress a new law that would place marihuana and i ts distribution direcdy under federal control. Secondly, on radio and at ma jor forums... I told of this evil weed of the fields and riverbeds and roadsides . I wrote articles for magazines; our agents gave hundreds of lectures to parents, educators, social and civic leaders. In network broadcasts I reported on the growing list of crime, including murder and rape.\" One of the articles Harry Anslinger wrote appeared in the July 1937 issue of The American Magazine titled \"Marihuana-Assassin of Youth.\" There are striking similarities between the content of this a rticle and the content of the movie Reefer Madness. For example, from the article : \"In 1931, the marijuana file of the United States Narcotic Bureau was less than two inches thick, while today the reports crowd many large cab inets.\" Now compare this to what appeared in the movie. Dr. Carroll is with the government man who says: \"Let me show you something. In 1930, the records on marijuana in the Washington office of the Narcotics Division scarcely filled a small folder like this (less than two inches thick). Toda y, they fill cabinets.\" The camera shows us a wall lined with file cabinets. In the book Outsiders, Howard S. Becker describes h ow the Federal Bureau of Narcotics under Harry Anslinger created the mari juana problem to cause the public to demand legislation. 39 A bill giving the federal government control over marijuana was introduced in Congress b y Representative Robert L. Doughton of North Carolina, Chairman of the Hous e Ways and Means Committee. 40 On August 2, 1937, Franklin Delano Roosevelt signe d into law the Marijuana Tax Act, which became effective o n October 1, 1937. 41 The purpose of propaganda is to direct public atten tion to certain \"facts.\" \"The whole art consists in doing this so skillfully that everyone will be convinced that the fact is real,\" writes Adolf Hitl er in Mein Kampf. He describes the principles of effective propaganda: i t must be aimed at the emotions; it must be limited to a few points; it mu st repeat those points over and over again until the public believes it. T o be effective, propaganda must constantly short-circuit all thought and decis ion. It must operate on the individual subconsciously. 42 The principles behind The Big Lie of propaganda are the same principles of mind control, hypnotic suggestion, 13"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"mental programming: distraction and repetition. Wit h propaganda, distraction draws attention away from information t hat is true and directs attention to information that is false.

There is a vast amount of misinformation about mari juana, much of it originating in the 1930s with the so-called \"educat ional campaign,\" of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. Propaganda is not only meant to influence opinions and attitudes but also to cause action. Go vernment propaganda \"suggests\" that public opinion demands what the gov ernment has already decided to do. 43 The official reasons given by the Federal Bureau o f Narcotics for its opposition to the use of marijuana shifted completely during 1949- 1950 from the claim that use of marijuana led to cr ime and violence to the claim that marijuana use led to heroin use. 44 When questioned by Congressman John Dingell of Michigan during testimo ny before the House Ways and Means Committee whether \"the marijuana add ict graduates into a heroin, an opium, or a cocaine user,\" Commissioner Anslinger replied: \"No, Sir; I have not heard of a case of that kind.\" 45 However, in 1955, Anslinger appeared before a Senate subcommittee investigating the traffic in illicit drugs and testified that marijuana leads to heroin addiction. 46 During Congressional hearings in 1937, Dr. W. C. Wo odward, Legislative Counsel for the American Medical Association, point ed out that there was no competent primary evidence to support the claims against marijuana, only newspaper accounts about growing marijuana add iction and that marijuana causes crime. 47 These \"news\" accounts were \"planted\" by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. Of seventeen articles condemning marijuana that appeared in popular magazines from July 1937 t o June 1939, ten either acknowledged the help of the Bureau in furnishing f acts and figures or gave evidence of having received help by using facts and figures that had appeared in Bureau publications or in testimony given during Congressional hearings. An indication of the Bureau's influence i n these articles is found in repeated \"atrocity\" stories that were first reporte d by the Bureau. 48 These same stories appeared in Reefer Madness. 14"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"7. Information Control By clever manipulation, people can be led to believ e something that is not true when such information is carefully timed and p resented by an accepted and respected authority. Information is processed b y the brain in a very specific way. At the base of the brain, there is a \"check valve\" called the Reticular Activating System that screens informatio n. What seems to happen is this: when new information is introduced, it is compared with previously acquired information and then catalogued . When the information is required, it is retrieved and brought into consc ious awareness according to need. Now if there is no \"file\" for the piece of in formation, a file is begun and added to when related information is acquired. If you accept the information as true, it is catalogued that way. And if you reject the information as false, it is catalogued that way. Ho wever, if you don't know if the information is true or not, your trust in th e source of information determines whether or not you accept it ,even if yo u are not sure or don't understand it. Secret knowledge is the basis of all power. Your so urce of information depends upon who you are and what position you hold in society. Your source of information determines the reliability of what you know. What you know and the reliability of what you know deter mines everything that happens to you. And information can be controlled. Words can inform or misinform. What people think can be controlled by c ontrolling information. In Orwell's 1984, the primary means of oppression i s the absolute control of information.

The Founding Fathers defined the fo rm of government which they set up as a constitutional republic. 50 Not one of these textbooks lists the word \"republic\" in its index. 51 These textbooks interpret U.S. history primarily as a clash between rich and poor, haves a nd have-nots, \"privileged\" and \"unprivileged,\" which is economic determinism, the essence of Marxism, where the triumph of \"the common man\" is p rogress towards a more perfect \"people's democracy.\" 52 A trend shared by each of the textbooks reviewed was advocacy of a world government where g lobal committment is preferable to national interests, thus promoting wo rld socialism and \"big\" government. 53 The college textbook Introductory Psychology (secon d edition) by Jonathan L. Freedman, published by Addison-Wesley P ublishing Company, contains information that is misleading, contradict ory and false. This book uses the principles of mental programming to progra m the student to accept information that is not true. This text was used fo r \"General Psychology\" course 221 at the University of North Carolina at G reensboro, fall semester, 1982. This book defines hypnosis as \"A state of conscious ness produced by entrusting oneself to another person, and character ized by heightened suggestibility, acceptance of distortion, selective attention and similar symptoms.\" 54 Part of this definition is true, the rest is misle ading and false. First of all, it is not necessary to entrust yourse lf to another person to produce the hypnotic state of mind. Dr. James Braid demonstrated that the hypnotic state of mind could be produced by fixing your gaze upon a bright object. 55 In fact, any repeating light or sound pattern can lead you into that state of mind that is just like \"day dreaming.\" The re is selective attention and heightened suggestibility. There is \"acceptance of distortion\" only when distorted information is given and you don't know t hat it is distorted information. The word \"symptoms\" is usually used wh en referring to an illness or disorder. The hypnotic state of mind is a natural state of mind; it is neither an illness nor a disorder. This book end s its discussion of hypnosis saying: \"Although there is little evidence that anyone has used hypnosis for evil or unpleasant purposes, the poten tial for such may exist.\" 56 U.S. intelligence officer Charles McQuiston says th at Sirhan Sirhan was hypnotically programmed to kill Robert Kennedy. 57 Dr. John W. Heisse, 16"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Jr., president of the International Society of Stre ss Analysis, studied Sirhan's psychiatric charts and interviews. He beli eves that Sirhan was brainwashed under hypnosis: \"Sirhan kept repeating certain phrases. This clearly revealed he had been programmed to put hims elf into a trance.\" 58 \"It's very possible to distort and change somebody's mind through a number of hypnotic sessions,\" says Dr. Herbert Spiegel, a med ical expert on hypnosis. \"It can be described as brainwashing because the mi nd is cleared of its old emotions and values which are replaced by implantin g other suggestions.\" 59 Behavior-modified agents, known as \"zombies\" in the intelligence community, are individuals who have been subconscio usly programmed for a task. 60 Here is what the second edition of Introductory Psy chology says about brainwashing: \"... some people who talk about brain washing seem to believe that it involves extremely powerful methods that are almost irresistable. However, there is no evidence to sugg est the existence of any such methods... in fact, the attempts at brainwashi ng that we know about were not especially successful.\" 61 It is interesting to note that, while more papers have been published on subliminal perception than on many other single topics in psychology, the space given the su bject in most general textbooks is minimal to non-existent. 62 \"A general state education is a mere contrivance fo r molding people to be exactly like one another; and as the mold in which it casts them is that which pleases the predominant power in the governme nt,... it establishes a despotism over the mind, leading by natural tendenc y to one over the body,\" said John Stuart Mills. 63 Education of the young is used to condition them to what comes later, thus eliminating the differenc e between propaganda and teaching. 64 Propaganda cannot work effectively without educati on. The mind is conditioned with vast amounts of information pos ing as \"facts\" and \"knowledge\" dispensed for ulterior motives. 65 The \"educated\" and \"intellectuals\" are the most vulnerable to propagan da because they absorb the largest amount of secondhand information and co nsider themselves to be \"above\" the effects of propaganda. 66 The August 22, 1982 edition of the Winston-Salem Jo urnal contains a story from the N.Y. Times News Service titled \"Some Exper ts Doubt the Power of Subliminal Messages\": Amid claims and countercla ims for the power and pervasiveness of subliminal techniques, little scie ntific evidence has accumulated to show that either exists... A number of psychologists are now challenging the very notion that people can be influenced in any way 17"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"by messages they cannot consciously see or hear.\" R emember that propaganda draws attention away from information th at is true and directs attention to information that is false. Also rememb er that your trust in the source of your information determines whether or no t you accept the information as true even if you are not sure or don 't understand it. Thomas Jefferson said: \"The man who never looks into a new spaper is better informed than he who reads them, inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer the truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods and errors.\" 67 The article ends by quoting Charles F. Adams speaki ng for the American Association of Advertising Agencies in 1981: \"We ar e convinced that there is no subliminal advertising in America today.\" 68 Every major advertising agency in North America has sponsored extensive research into subliminal perception. 69 Vance Packard's 1957 book The Hidden Persuaders revealed that American industry w as researching the use of subliminal messages to motivate people to buy th eir products. Wilson Bryan Key has written three books exposing the wide spread and sophisticated use of subliminal ads by the advertis ing industry. 70 Even children are exploited for profit. \"When you sell a kid on your product, if he can't get it, he will throw himself on the floor, s tamp his feet, and cry. You can't get a reaction like that out of an adult\" 71 Research on children begins as early as ages two and three using the psychologi cal techniques of finger sensors, eye-tracking and brainwave measurements. 72 U.S. advertising agencies have exported commercial subliminal techni ques throughout Western Europe, the Far East, and Latin America. 73 It is interesting to note that J. Walter Thompson, the world's largest advert ising agency, was the former employer of H. R. Haldeman and a half-dozen implicated Nixon White House aides during the Watergate scandal. 74 8. Manipulation of Language In Orwell's 1984, the manipulation of language is t he key to controlling the people. In time, a new language is created so that the aims of the ruling 18"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"elite might best be served. \"Newspeak\" redefines wo rds that at one time had universal meaning, making it more and more difficul t and ultimately impossible for people to communicate thoughts not s anctioned by the government. Traditional definitions are eliminated while new meanings are repeated over and over again until accepted. Langua ge is used to conceal truth and dignify absurdities. In addition to debas ing language, the principle of \"doublethink\" is instituted. Doublethink is the ability to accept two contradictory beliefs, without perceiving it is ill ogical to do so. \"In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five , and you would have to believe it. It was inevitable that they should m ake that claim sooner or later: the logic of their position demanded it.\" The Vietnam War produced many examples of governmen t Newspeak and doublethink. Bombing missions were called \"protecti ve reaction strikes,\" a refugee camp became a \"new life hamlet,\" and the Am erican invasion of Cambodia was termed an \"incursion.\" During the Nixo n administration, government Newspeak and doublethink were rampant Wh en White House press secretary Ron Ziegler contradicted statements made previously, he termed his former statements \"inoperative.\" Crimina l acts were committed under the guise of \"national security\" and \"executi ve privilege.\" Nixon aides abused their power from an \"excess of zeal.\" As in 1984, lies were the truth, the truth was a lie. 75 The February 11, 1984 edition of the Winston-Salem Journal contains a story from United Press Internat ional titled \"State Department Strikes 'Killing' From Reports\": \"The wo rd 'killing\" has been stricken from State Department human rights reports . Officials explained yesterday that the government considers it more pre cise to say \"unlawful or arbitrary deprivation of life.\" 76 The January 1984 edition of Reader's Digest contain s an article titled \"1984 Is Here: Where is Big Brother?\" \"Many would have us believe that George Orwell's classic novel 1984 is in fact a portrait o f present-day America. Nonsense!\" 77 The December 10, 1983 edition of The Sentinel cont ains an article by Edwin M. Yoder, Jr. of the Washington Po st Writers Group titled \" 1984—Fantasy Year Could Never Be Otherwise':\" ... none of Orwell's imaginary nightmare materialized... the nightmare o f total human conditioning remains but an ominous fantasy.\" 78 From 1984:: \"The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ea rs. It was their final, most essential command.\" Common sense tells us that one must first gain the confidence and respect of people in order to deceive them. \"We frequently have the illusion that we 19"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"are in complete control of ourselves and the conten ts of our minds and psyches; and it is this illusion that makes it poss ible for us to be manipulated all the more successfully.\" 79 Most people do not exercise their intelligence and critical faculties in evaluating t he vast amount of information they are assaulted with. As a result, t hey abdicate their responsibility for what happens to them. However, r esponsibility cannot be discarded so easily and without a price to pay. \"Th ose who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must, like men, undergo the fa tigue of supporting it,\" wrote Thomas Paine. 80 Once freedom is lost, it is much harder to regain. History shows that when people do not take responsi bility for their lives, there are those who will take it for them, and ulti mately from them. 9. Monopoly of Mass Media \"The nearly complete monopoly of mass communication s is generally agreed to be one of the most striking characteristi cs of totalitarian dictatorships,\" writes President Carter's National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski in his book Totalitarian Dictatorship an d Autocracy . Brzezinski goes on to say that even though the government cont rols all the means of communication in a dictatorship, the government doe sn't necessarily have to own all the means of communication. 81 Without mass media, there could be no effective propaganda. To make the coordination o f propaganda possible, the media must be concentrated, the number of news agencies reduced, and press, publishing, radio, television and film monop olies established. 82 Only through concentration in a few hands of a large num ber of media can there be an orchestration and continuity to propaganda an d the application of scientific methods to influence the public. 83 The campaign against marijuana that led to the Marijuana Tax Act illustr ates such co-ordination of the media and psychological manipulation. The motion picture industry is a prime example of t he tendency toward concentration of ownership in the communications me dia. From its beginning, the film industry has been characterized by repeated attempts at 20"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"domination by a small number of companies that trad itionally have tried either to exclude others from the business or to de prive competitors of resources. 84 Dominance in the American market is carried abroad by the major companies and has cultural, social and politi cal consequences. 85 The desire for American goods in other countries was cr eated by American films. After World War II, the film industry and the gover nment worked together for world-wide distribution to create markets for A merican goods. 86 U.S.- made films account for half the box office receipts in France and more in England, West Germany and elsewhere. Eddie Murphy w as \"actor of the year\" for the Paris daily Le Matin.. Michael Jackso n was top singer. European radios play up to eighty percent American music. Each week \"Starsky et 'Utch\" speak street Parisian to Huggy B ear. Magnum, the Harts and Charlie's Angels are only a few of Europe's tel evision heroes. In Iceland, \"Soap\" was the top show of 1983. \"We have colonized their subconscious,\" observes American novelist Paul Theroux. 87 Hypnotically programming large populations, especially in economically under developed nations, educates the poor to want things that they cannot r ealistically have, causing anxiety and resentment directed not only to their g overnment but to the United States as well. Many countries are rebelling against this cultural invasion by the American media. \"At U.S. bases in G ermany, people protest missiles while wearing Coca-Cola T-shirts,\" says Alfred Mechtersheimer of the Institute for Peace Politics near Munich. 88 The 1940 Republican Presidential candidate Wendell L. Wilkie was chairman of the board of Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. in 1942. 89 William P. Rogers, Secretary of State during the Ni xon administration, was on the board of directors of Twentieth Century-Fox before Denver oil tycoon Marvin Davis bought the film company for $722 milli on in June 1981. 90 Former President Gerald R. Ford and Henry Kissinger have both been on the board of directors of Twentieth Century-Fox and the y are currently consultants to the film company. 91 In 1982, Henry Kissinger became a consultant for ABC News and was a consultant for NB C in 1977. 92 Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale was a member of th e board of directors of Columbia Pictures Industries before the Atlanta-bas ed Coca-Cola Company bought Columbia Pictures in June 1982 for $751.6 mi llion. 93 And former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig, Jr. is on the board of directors of MGM/UA Entertainment Company. 94 21"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"10. Mental Programming and Mass Media Motion pictures were an effective propaganda weapon during both world wars. German Chief of Staff Erich Ludendorff, writi ng in 1917, said: \"The war has demonstrated the superiority of the photogr aph and the film as a means of information and persuasion.\" 95 Lenin considered the cinema the most important of the arts. \"Molding the feeling an d intelligence of the masses is one of our political problems and for thi s end we find the movies most effective,\" said Russian film director Sergei Eisenstein. 96 Art is a way of seeing and what we see in art defines what we un derstand to be \"reality.\" The great political problem of the United States at the end of the nineteenth century was to find a way to assimilate the vast nu mbers of people who came from all the countries of Europe bringing with them their diverse traditions. The solution was psychological standard ization. This was accomplished by creating the American way of life a s portrayed by the \"American Dream.\" This also served an economic func tion. Mass production requires mass consumption. There cannot be mass con sumption without the majority of the population having identical views a bout what constitutes the necessities of life. Without psychological uniformi ty advertising and other forms of propaganda could not manipulate the public with certainty. 97 D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation exploded on the screen in 1915 and caused dissension in almost every city and communit y it played. 98 The radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds caused panic. Re efer Madness encouraged marijuana use and was part of a propagan da campaign that led to the Marijuana Tax Act The Warriors, one of a number of \"gang\" movies, was followed by a rash of violence in cities across the nation. 99 Approximately twenty-eight people died playing Russ ian roulette in response to viewing The Deer Hunter.

Produced on videotape for realism, the made-for-TV movie Spe cial Bulletin about terrorists exploding an atomic bomb in Charleston, South Carolina looks and sounds like a real news broadcast in every deta il. Like the radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds, the cast of characters in clude the anchorperson(s), correspondents reporting from the field and outside \"experts\" brought in to comment on new developments. Despite disclaimers, t he re-run of Special Bulletin prompted numerous calls to stations across the nation from people who wanted to know if it was real. 103 The techniques of psychotherapy, widely practiced a nd accepted as a means of curing psychological disorders, are also methods of controlling people. They can be used systematically to influence attitu des and behavior. 104 Systematic desensitization is a method used to diss olve anxiety so that the patient (public) is no longer troubled by a specifi c fear, a fear of violence for example. 105 A progressively more graphic depiction of violence in the movies and on television desensitizes the viewer, e specially young people, to real-life violence/People adapt to frightening c ircumstances if they are exposed to them enough. Implosive therapy serves th e same purpose as desensitization. However, instead of gradually wear ing down a specific fear, this method is designed to create an internal explo sion (implosion) of anxiety, frightening the patient (public) as much a s possible to \"burn out\" the object of fear. 106 Thus, The Day After and Special Bulletin could lea ve many viewers so numbed by a sense of hopelessness a nd helplessness that they could succumb to deep apathy with regard to an ything that has to do with the prospect of nuclear confrontation.

Communi cation depends heavily upon actions, postures, movements and expre ssions. 107 Think back to the times when you have had a conversation with someone and you had the \"gut feeling\" that you were being lied to. Word s don't always communicate truthfully and there are things that co mmunicate more than words. Meaning comes from the sound of someone's vo ice and \"body language.\" There are many ways of \"faking\" body lan guage to achieve an end. Authors of books on self-improvement and how t o make friends and influence people are aware of the importance of bod y language and the importance of faking it properly to guarantee socia l success. Politicians have learned its importance and how to use it effec tively. No matter what John Kennedy said, a few gestures and a correct pos ture captivated his audience. 108 Lyndon Johnson's arm motions were always too studi ed, too mannered. Nixon's gestures were so rigid and exagge rated that they lent themselves to a comic situation. 109 With his shirt sleeves rolled up, Jimmy Carter tried to show that he was at ease with ordin ary people and said: \"I will never lie to you; I will never mislead you.\" C ontrary to the Carter image, one veteran speech writer left Carter's camp aign: \"The candidate and the campaign were the opposite of what they appeare d to be.\" 110 NBC News reporter Roger Mudd made the observation that Senat or Gary Hart seemed to imitate the late President Kennedy. 111 Rev. Jesse Jackson is an accomplished orator, speaking with an evangelistic tone, metapho r and rhyme. His hand gestures are deliberate and convey an emotional con text to his words. It should not be forgotten that President Reagan has e xtensive training as an actor. Called \"The Great Communicator\" by the media , Ronald Reagan is a politician who is a \"real\" actor, a man who began h is career by convincing radio audiences that he was at a sports event when in fact he was reading off a ticker-tape machine and inventing the details. 112 Think for a moment about the way newscasters speak and you will realize that they all talk the same way regardless of their ethnic background.

The Power of Money Conspiracies to seize the power of government are a s old as the institution of government. 115 \"In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it h appens, you can bet it was planned that way,\" said Franklin Delano Roosevelt. 116 During the past two centuries when the peoples of t he world were gradually winning political freedom from monarchies, the majo r banking families of Europe and America were reversing the trend by form ing new dynasties of political control through international financial a lliances. 117 The goal was to create a world-wide system of financial control in order to dominate me economy of the world and the political system of ea ch country. 118 The United States is dominated by a hierarchy of we althy families. 119 The control of private wealth is held by families and f amily alliances, reinforced by marriages among their members, that guide the ba nks and control the corporations. 120 Historically, government has been the servant of p rivate wealth. 121 The first fortunes in the New World were political creations. Land and trading privileges were granted by the British and Dutch crowns upon 25"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"favored individuals and companies. 122 Every great fortune that came out of the nineteenth century was rooted in fraud. \"In the ir absorbing passion for the accumulation of wealth, men were plundering the resources of the country like burglars looting a palace.\" 123 The public has been deluded about the material aims of a few and the very exist ence of those who rule the majority. Rule through money has been fashioned into the ultimate system for securing and maintaining power. 124 Nineteenth century American author Edward Bellamy, concerned with the extent and consequences of man's inhumanity to man, describes how the \"system\" operates in The Parable of The Water Tank. There was a certain very dry land and the people needed water badly. Th ey did nothing but look for water and many perished because they could not find any. There were, however, certain men in that land who were more cun ning than the rest and they gathered supplies of water where others could find none, and these men were called capitalists. The people came unto the c apitalists and begged for water and the capitalists answered: \"Be ye our serv ants and ye shall have water,\" And so the capitalists organized the people and they made a great tank for the water, and the tank was called the Mar ket. The capitalists said unto the people: \"For every bucket of water that ye bring us, we will give you a penny, but for every bucket that we give unto you, ye shall give to us two pennies, and the difference shall be our profit , seeing that if it were not for this profit we would not do this thing for you and you would all perish.\" And after many days the water tank, which was the M arket, did overflow and the capitalists said unto the people: \"Bring us no more water till the tank be empty.\" But when the people received no more pennie s from the capitalists, they could buy no more water. And when the capitali sts saw that they had no more profit, they were troubled and said among t hemselves, \"We must advertise.\" But the people had no pennies to buy th e water and the situation was called a \"crisis.' The thirst of the people was great, but the capital ists would not give of the water, saying \"Business is business.\" But the capit alists were disturbed because the people bought no more water, and so the y acquired no more profits. They then sent for the soothsayers to inte rpret this predicament. The soothsayers were men learned in dark savings, who j oined themselves to the capitalists so that they would have water, and they spoke for the capitalists and did their bidding for them. The soothsayers sai d that the people bought no more water because of \"overproduction\" and other s said it was because of \"lack of confidence.\" The capitalists were comforte d and they sent the soothsayers unto the people who saw the emptiness o f their wisdom and did 26"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"mock them. The capitalists became fearful that the people would come upon the tank and take the water by force. And so they b rought forth certain holy men who were false priests to testify to the people that this affliction was sent to them by God for the healing of their souls, and that if they would bear it in patience and lust not after the water, n or trouble the capitalists, it would come to pass that after they had given up the ghost they would come to a place where mere would be no capitalists but a n abundance of water. When the capitalists saw that the people were still discontent and would not be still, neither for the words of the soothsayers nor of the false priests, they came forth themselves and wet their fingertips in t he water that overflowed from the tank and they scattered the drops upon the people and the drops were called \"charity.\" But still there was great un rest among the people. The capitalists sought out the mightiest and all who ha d skill in war and they became a defense unto the capitalists. And after ma ny days the water was low in the tank, for the capitalists wasted the wat er for their pleasure. When the capitalists saw that the tank was empty, they s aid, \"The crisis is ended.\" They hired the people to fill again the tank that w as the Market, and gave the people a penny for each bucket the people broug ht and took two pennies for each bucket they did give unto the people. 125 12. The Ruling Elite and \"World Government\" Nineteenth century British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli commented that the world is governed by very different people from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes. Dr. Carroll Qu igley who taught at Harvard and Princeton and at the Foreign Service Sc hool of Georgetown University wrote about this network of \"insiders\" w ho govern from behind the scenes in Tragedy and Hope—a History of the Wor ld In Our Time: \"I know of the operations of this network because I ha ve studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960s, to examine its 27"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"papers and secret instruments. I have objected, bot h in the past and recently, to a few of its policies (notably to its belief tha t England was an Atlantic rather than a European Power and must be allied, or even federated, with the United States and must remain isolated from Europe) , but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to re main unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough t o be known.\" 126 Political and economic power in the United States i s concentrated in the hands of a \"ruling elite\" that controls most U.S.-b ased multinational corporations, major communications media, the most influential foundations, major private universities and most pu blic utilities. 127 Founded in 1921, the Council of Foreign Relations is the ke y link between the large corporations and the federal government. 128 It has been called a \"school for statesmen\" and \"comes close to being an organ of wh at C. Wright Mills has called the Power Elite—a group of men, similar in i nterest and outlook shaping events from invulnerable positions behind t he scenes.\" 129 The creation of the United Nations was a Council projec t, as well as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 130 Council members include Henry Kissinger, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Cart er, Walter Mondale, Alexander Haig, George Schultz, Casper Weinberger. 131 Twelve Council members were part of President Lyndo n B. Johnson's Senior Advisory Group on Vietnam. 132 President Richard M. Nixon appointed more than 110 Council members to key gove rnment positions during his administration. 133 The majority of major appointments to the State Department by President Jimmy Carter in 1977 were members of the Council. 134 Most CIA directors have been Council members, incl uding Vice President George Bush and William Casey. 135 Nearly all major media in the U.S. have connections with the Council. 136 The president of the country's largest labor union, the AFL-CIO, Lane Kirkland is a member. 137 Membership includes a high concentration of corpora te leaders from such companies as ITT, IBM and Standard Oil. 138 David Rockefeller has been a director of the Council since 1949 and chairman of the board since 1970. 139 The Council has been called \"The Establishment,\" \"t he invisible government\" and \"the Rockefeller foreign office.\" 140 The goal of the Council is the establishment of a \"World Government.\" 141 Gold and diamond magnate Cecil Rhodes stated his co mmitment to the establishment of a World Government in his first wi ll called the \"Secret Society Will.\" His aim was clear: \"The extension of British rule throughout the world.\" The secret society was called The Round Table, which worked 28"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"behind the scenes at the highest levels of the Brit ish government.

This group calls itself the Bilderbergers, created by former Nazi SS storm trooper Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. 146 Called \"the most exclusive club of the Western establishment,\" the Bilderberg Group includes some of the world's most powerful financiers, industrialist s, statesmen and intellectuals, who meet each year for a conference on world affairs. 147 Those attending have included British Prime Minister Marg aret Thatcher, West German leader Helmut Schmidt, France's Valery Gisca rd D'Estaign, Henry Kissinger, Gerald R. Ford, Walter Mondale and David Rockefeller. 148 The ultimate goal of the Bilderberg Group is the establ ishment of a World Government. 149 A World Government has always been the objective of Communism. The Bolshevik Revolution of November 1917 was a turning point in world history. \"The main purveyors of funds for the revol ution, however, were neither the crackpot Russian millionaires nor the a rmed bandits of Lenin. The \"real\" money primarily came from certain Britis h and American circles which for a long time past had lent their support t o the Russian revolutionary cause,\" writes General Arsene de Goul evitch in Czarism and the Revolution. 150 Some of the world's richest and most powerful men f inanced the Bolshevik Revolution, a movement that claims it will strip th ese very same men of their power and wealth, men like the Rothschilds, R ockefellers, Schiffs, Warburgs, Morgans, Harrimans and Milners. 151 In Decline of the West, Oswald Spengler wrote: \"There is no proletarian, no t even a Communist movement, that has not operated in the interests of money, in the direction indicated by money, and for the time being permitte d by money-and that 29"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"without the idealists among its leaders having the slightest suspicion of the fact.\" 152 Describing events at the 1968 S.D.S national conve ntion in The Strawberry Statement: Notes of a College Revolution ary, James Kunen says: \"Also at the convention, men from Business In ternational Roundtables--the meetings sponsored by Business Int ernational—tried to buy up a few radicals. These men are the world's leadin g industrialists and they convene to decide how our lives are going to go.\" 153 The program of the Communist International of 1936 states that world dictatorship \"can be established only by victory of socialism in different countries or groups of countries, after which the P roletariat Republics would unite on federal lines with those already in existe nce, and this system would expand...at length forming the world union of Sovie t Socialist Republics.\" 154 Socialism means government ownership and/or contro l over the basic means of production and distribution of g oods and services. State ownership and regulation of the entire economy mean s government control over everything. The evolution of economic history shows a straight line movement toward consolidation of wealth. 155 This evolution \"flows from competition to combination, and from large combinat ion to colossal combination, and it flows on to socialism, which is the most colossal combination of all.\" 156 Communism is totalitarian socialism. Communism is a movement created and manipulated by some of th e world's most powerful and wealthy men in order to gain control o ver the world, first by establishing socialist governments in different cou ntries and then consolidating them through a \"Great Merger\" into an all-powerful socialist dictatorship. 157 John predicted that before the great epic of Millen nial peace, humanity would be subjected to a ruthless, world-wide dictat orship which would attempt to make all men subservient to it or be kil led (Revelation 13:15). He said that this dictatorship would compel men, \"b oth small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,\" to be identified with it (Revelation 13:16). Unless a person be identified with its monopolistic contro l, \"no man might buy and sell\" (Revelation 13:17). Founded in 1944 at a U.N. Monetary and Financial Co nference at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, the International Monetary Fu nd oversees the world economy.

Plato's blueprint for a new society begins with breaking up the existing social structure by whatever means necessary, including force, in order to establish the \"ideal\" society. There would be three classes: the special ruling class, a powerful army and the working class. There would be slaves a lso, but slaves would not be considered citizens. Marriage would be elimi nated. Women would be equal with men-equal to fight wars with men and per form labor like men. Sexual activity would be controlled and limited by the State. There would be selective breeding of children and children conside red inferior or crippled would be destroyed. People would be induced to beli eve falsehoods taught as religious principles. Myths would convey important \"truths\" to young or untrained minds. Religious institutions would be re gulated by a recognized national authority. Priests would have no authority over beliefs, but would be officials whose duty it would be to perform ritu als. War would cease when all states are united in a world-state accordi ng to the principles prescribed by Plato.

Education as Propaganda All totalitarian movements are vitally concerned wi th the indoctrination of the young. Both Mussolini and Hitler organized yout h before their rise to power. 160 Because of this, popular culture (movies, TV and m usic) is of great importance as is a general State education. P lato advised censorship of literature for schools and advocated control of poe try, music, painting, sculpture and architecture. 161 Dr. W. J. Spillman, former chief of the Federal Farm Management Bureau of the Department of Agricul ture, stated in a letter to the New York Globe of March 28, 1919: \"Ni ne years ago I was approached by an agent of Mr. Rockefeller with the statement that his object in establishing the General Education Board was to gain control of the educational institutions of the country so that all men employed in them might be \"right.\" 162 The General Education Board was organized in 1902 b y John D. Rockefeller, founder of the Standard Oil Company. 163 The General Education Board was the first of the Rockefeller foundations and influe nced the development of America's educational system. 164 The objective was stated by Rockefeller and Baptist minister Rev. Frederick Taylor Gates, t he guiding force in many of Rockefeller's enterprises, in the first publicat ion of the General Education Board, the \"Occasional Paper No. 1,\" in 1904: \"In o ur dreams we have limitless resources and the people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hands.

The mind is conditioned with vast amounts of information posing as \"facts\" and \"knowledge\" dispensed for ulterior motives. 167 Remember the first principle behind mental programming: distraction. With propag anda, distraction focuses attention on information that is false. Rep etition of the false information imbeds it in your subconscious mind so that your acceptance of its truth and accuracy becomes a conditioned respon se, circumventing analysis. Therefore, you accept this information as true without thinking about it. This is especially true in school where t here is pressure to accept what is presented as true because that is what is e xpected of you. Remember that your trust in the source of information determ ines whether or not you accept it. What people think can be controlled by c ontrolling information. People can be led to believe something that is not true when that information is presented by an accepted authority. 14. Communism For years the message has been repeated over and ov er again that Communism is the enemy, that Communism seeks to con quer the world. This is a distraction to draw attention away from w hat has actually been happening. It is true that Communism seeks world do mination, but this is not the whole story. Since 1917 the Soviet Union ha s openly and consistently advocated the overthrow of Western gov ernments. However, Soviet economic development has been largely the re sult of Western technology from Western companies. This transfer of technology has been allowed and encouraged by Western governments, prim arily the United States, Great Britain, Germany, France and Italy. 168 \"The penetration of early Soviet industry by Western companies and indi viduals was remarkable,\" writes Antony C.

Censorship and travel restrictions within the Sovie t Union have been designed to hide the massive technological transfer s from the West as the primary explanation for Soviet economic and militar y growth. The Soviet Union is a Frankenstein monster that has been creat ed by the West. The first edition of The Communist Manifesto was pu blished in London in 1848. The first plank calls for the abolition of al l private property. Owning your own home has become an eroding dream for many Americans. As interest rates rise, home sales decline. The percen tage of Americans owning homes has fallen since 1980. 173 Home and farm foreclosures are a clear danger to growing numbers of Americans. 174 Family farms are rapidly becoming a thing of the past. More and more farmers are taking jobs off the form, as the ownership of the means of production b ecome more and more concentrated in industrialized \"superfarms.\" 175 The second plank advocates a graduated or progressive income tax. On October 3, 1913, Congress enacted the first income tax under the sixteenth amendment to the Constitution, thus instituting the graduated income tax proposed by Karl Marx. 176 Earlier attempts to impose the graduated income tax were de clared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. In 1902 the Chief Justice sta ted: \"It is a method to enslave our people, and deprive them of their liber ty and right to the fruit of their labors.\" 177 The graduated income tax was designed to squeeze t he middle class out of existence. 178 The fifth plank of The Communist Manifesto: \"Centralization of credit in the hands o f the State, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive m onopoly.\" On December 22, 1913 the Federal Reserve Act was passed. \"When the President signs this act, the invisible government by the money pow er will be legalized,\" Congressman Charles A. Lindbergh, Sr. told Congress after the vote. The members of the Federal Reserve Board are appointed by the President for fourteen-year terms.

Congressman Louis McFadden, Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committe e, commented that the Crash of '29 was not an accident. It was a care fully engineered event. \"The international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as the rulers of us all.\" 179 It is significant to note that all banking in the Soviet Union was not declar ed a State monopoly until December 14, 1917. 180 The sixth plank calls for the centralization of the means of communication in the hands of the Stat e. Even though the government controls all the means of communication in a dictatorship, the government doesn't necessarily have to own all the means of communication. 181 A concentration of ownership in the mass communications industry exists in the United States . 182 Without mass media, there could be no effective propaganda. To m ake the co-ordination of propaganda possible, the media must be concentrated , the number of news agencies reduced, and press, publishing, radio, tel evision and film monopolies established. Only through concentration in a few hands of a large number of media can there be an orchestration and continuity to propaganda and the application of scientific method s to influence public attitudes and behavior. 183 The number of unmarried couples living together has more than tripled since 1970. More and more young adults are living with th eir parents. 184 The number of divorces in 1979 was nearly triple the nu mber reported twenty years earlier. 185 For the first time in American history, white men are a minority in the nation's work force and the number of working women is steadily increasing. 186 The Communist Manifesto advocates the abolition of the family. Plato's blueprint for establishing the \"ideal\" State begins with breaking up the existing social order. This is bein g accomplished scientifically through the manipulation of the econ omy and the communications media. Movies, TV, and music are of great importance in molding young and untrained minds. In 1984, George Orwell predicted that the State would seek to control the sex drive, spec ifically by using psychological techniques to eliminate orgasm. 187 The rock video \"Relax\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, with pulsating light pat terns as a visual distraction, presents a verbal program: \"Relax. Don 't do it, when you want to go to it. Relax. Don't do it, when you want to c ome.\" The lyrics are repeated over and over again to the pulsating beat of the music. Any repeating light or sound pattern can lead you into the hypnotic state of mind where you are the most receptive to mental programm ing.

Television, movies and musi c strongly shape the social attitudes of young people and breed disappoi ntment in interpersonal relationships, encourage antagonism, suspicion and sometimes contempt between the sexes. 189 All of this is meant to facilitate the elimination of the family as proposed by Karl Marx and Plato in order to control people under a dictatorship. In 1984, personal relationships are replaced by political activism and devotion to the State. 190 A report released in 1982 by the National Institute of Mental Health said \"violence on television does lead to aggressive beh avior by children and teenagers who watch the programs.\" According to the 1982 Nielson Report on Television, the typical high school graduate has witnessed about 150,000 violent acts on television, including an estimated 25,000 deaths. 191 Dr. Thomas Narut from the U.S. Naval Hospital at NATO h eadquarters in Naples has investigated the use of film to train se rvicemen who were not inclined to kill to be able to do so. Films were sc reened which showed people being maimed or killed violently to desensit ize the men to such acts. 192 A progressively more graphic depiction of violence on television and in the movies desensitizes the viewer, especially y oung people, to real-life violence, and at the same time older people, becomi ng fearful, demand that something be done. Note that this is the same strat egy used in the campaign against marijuana. Marijuana use is encouraged amon g young people, as in the Cheech and Chong movies, while older people are scared into demanding tougher legislation and penalties. Government propa ganda directs public opinion to demand what the government has already d ecided to do. Movies, TV, and music often present violence as acceptable and sometimes laudable behavior. And older people are scared into demandin g tougher legislation and penalties because of this very same behavior, bring ing the country closer and closer to a police state legislated by law. A University of Massachusetts study of crime progra ms on television reveals that law enforcement officers routinely bre ak-and-enter illegally, fail to inform suspects of their rights, terrorize and c oerce witnesses and commit bribery. Constitutional guarantees are regarded as bothersome \"technicalities\" that hinder the police in the perf ormance of their duty.

During its 1983-84 term, the Supreme Court significantly expanded poli ce powers and governmental authority while curtailing individual rights, thus enacting into law principles much like those presented on TV crim e shows. 196 Thomas Jefferson believed that government governs b est which governs least. The Founding Fathers considered that the pri mary purpose of government is to promote the happiness of society. The Framers of the Constitution adopted two basic guidelines to achiev e society's happiness, safety, liberty and justice: First, power must not be allowed to concentrate either in individuals or institutions. Second, the ultimate power must reside with the people. All lawful government is founded o n the consent of the people. 197 \"One of the irreversible currents I have noted in thirty-four years of reporting is the hankering of our leaders to tra nsform themselves from servants into sovereigns,\" writes columnist Jack An derson. 198 James Madison said: \"The accumulation of all powers, legi slative, executive and judicial in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\" 199 Recognizing that the primary threat to society was arbitrary, unrestrained, unaccountable power, the F ramers of the Constitution sought to restrain government so that it could not restrain the liberties and rights of the people. Their device fo r this end was the separation of powers so that no segment of governme nt could amass enough power to establish a dictatorship. However, the sov ereignty of the people has disintegrated because the separation of powers has broken down. 200 Power has been steadily centralized in the executiv e branch of the federal government. 201 37"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"15.

Jerry Falwell admonishes: \"If a man stands by this book, vote for him. If he doesn't, d on't.\" 203 Politics and religion are intertwined in the United States. The Bible has exerted an unrivaled influence on American culture, politics a nd social life. There was a time when Bible study was the core of public educat ion. Americans publish more Bibles than any other people. Only in America is there a \"Bible belt\" with Bible camps, Bible colleges, Bible institutes and Bible bookstores. Our nation's battles have been religious crusades as pr eachers and politicians used the Bible to justify their causes. The history of t he Bible in America is a history of conflicting interpretations. Both slave- owners and abolitionists cited the Bible for their cause, as did civil-right s marchers and segregationists in the 1960s. 204 \"The entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation is the inerrant word of God, and totally accurate in all respects,\" says Jerry F alwell. 205 Fundamentalists believe the Bible to be the ultimate authority in a ll matters, the \"revealed, inspired, infallible and inerrant Word of God.\" 206 They spread the Word in accordance with the New Testament commandment: \"Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.\" 207 Religious programming on TV is flooding the airways. 208 One of the biggest forces in religious broadcasting is the Christian Broadcasting Network. It is the largest noncommercial broadcasting network in the world. \"T he 700 Club,\" hosted by CBN founder Pat Robertson, is seen around the wo rld. 209 \"The PTL 38"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Club,\" hosted by Jim Bakker, is a talk show in a fo rmat similar to Johnny Carson's \"Tonight Show.\" There is also Jerry Falwel l's \"Old-Time Gospel Hour,\" Jimmy Swaggart, James Robison, Kenneth Copel and and old-timers Oral Roberts, Billy Graham and Rex Humbard. The new est entry is the American Christian Television System of the Souther n Baptist Convention. TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart has said: \"Your mind i s the gateway to your spirit. The mind is the place where the battlegroun d is.\" 210 The fundamentalist movement demonstrates mastery of pro paganda and mind control over its adherents and converts. Because of its sense of mission, the fundamentalist movement resembles past totalitarian movements by transforming political, economic and social issues into a Crusade. Its machinery for control consists of a highly-organize d and well-funded political machine, a vast mass-communications netwo rk, an independent (Christian) education system, Bible studies, church es and missionary organizations. \"They believe that they possess the ultimate truth which has been revealed through the Bible and that their inte rpretation of Scriptures constitutes the irrefutable will of God,\" said form er Senator Frank Church of Idaho. 211 \"We must be obedient to the Word of God,\" says Jer ry Falwell. \"Whatsoever He sayeth unto you, do! That's all ther e is to it!\" 212 Repetition of verses from the Bible is a predominant part of t he fundamentalist program and all thoughts, feelings and actions are checked against it. As a result, all actions of the \"believers\" can be controlled and di rected with scientific precision because of their obedience to an unquesti oned mental program prescribing the limits for all human behavior. 213 16.

Those initiated in the \"mysteries\" were committed to strict secrecy. 215 Ancient Egyptian mysteries were a key to complete knowledge. This knowledge was preserved in the \"Hermetic\" writ ings of the legendary Egyptian prophet Hermes Trismegistus describing the soul's journey upward through higher spheres. The Cabala, a Hebrew mystic ism that evolved in France and Spain in the 12th and 13th centuries, co nceives God as infinite Light from which Creation emanates through ten succ essive spheres called Sepiroth. Though man separated himself from Sepirot h long ago, their divine attributes remain active in him, and he may, through them, return to the source of Light. 216 The Hermetic-Cabalist view of life is the belief i n man's power to tap the natural forces from higher s pheres. 217 This is \"the Force\" in Star Wars. What was fundamental to all th e mysteries, without exception, was the revelation of the true meaning o f death. 218 The doctrine of Salvation is fundamental to orthodo x Christian tradition. The New Testament teaches that the Christian is sav ed by \"grace,\" God's unmerited favor: \"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, le st any man should boast (Ephesians 2:8,9). The Last Judgment is also a fund amental doctrine: \"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of man; an d unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unt o salvation\" (Hebrews 9:27,28). The significance of these teachings is th eir absolute denial of the doctrine of karma where your deeds have an inescapa ble effect on your destiny in this life and in the next; and reincarna tion where numerous cycles of birth and death are necessary as a program of ex perience and learning in the upward journey toward spiritual perfection and graduation from this particular plane of existence. Reincarnation was on ce a part of Biblical teaching, but was censored. The New Testament was n ot recorded until long after Jesus died. 219 Christianity became the official religion of the R oman Empire in the third century. 220 A number of differing gospels existed at the time of the Council of Nicea in A.D. 325 where the present Bible was decided upon. Those judged unacceptable were destro yed, only what was considered acceptable remained. 221 Any changes, deletions, additions made by Church councils or by the monarch King James would have a profound effect on the masses for the Bible could be used ei ther to control or liberate them. 222 In its campaign against heresy, the Church destroy ed most of the ancient literature by burning libraries. 223 What people think can be controlled by controlling information. 40"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"17. Parapsychology Historically, parapsychology emerged from nineteent h century efforts to find scientific proof for life after death. Parapsycholo gy includes the study of mind-to-mind communication (telepathy), the ability to perceive hidden objects and events (clairvoyance), and the ability to move objects by use of mental power alone (psychokinesis). Psychic studies were first organized in 1882 by the Society for Psychical Research in Londo n, and an American society began three years later. First published in 1902, Human Personality and its Survival of Bodily Death by Frederic W. H. Myers has been called a classic in the field of psychical research. Myers gives evidence for survival of bodily death and communication with the \"dead.\" From a vast number of case histories, he reported instances where sleepin g people were seen somewhere else by other people, or their waking fro m dreams with previously unknown information. He cited occasions when me dead have been seen and described by people who had never see n them in life. He related cases of telepathic communication and \"out- of-body\" experiences. He concluded that there is something in the physical b ody that can leave it and this could be called the \"soul\" or \"spirit.\" 224 Thomas Alva Edison, one of the greatest inventors in history, gave serious tho ught to creating a machine for communicating with the \"dead.\" 225 Two different teams of researchers, one in the U.S. and the other in Germany, have both developed electronic devices that let them communicate with the dead. \"T his is undeniable proof that there is life after death,\" says Dr. Ernst Sen kowski, professor of physics at the Technical College of Bingen, West Germany. 226 In the CIA, the very word \"parapsychology\" is class ified and any CIA report mat mentions \"psi,\" which refers to the whole range of phenomena, is automatically classified top secret or higher. 227 Many scientists believe that findings in parapsychology can be used to manipulat e the minds of others. 228 In 1976, parapsychology research received direct s upport from CIA director George Bush. 229 Much of the current research on ESP involves out- 41"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"of-body experiences, especially remote viewing-the ability to leave one's physical body and visit distant places. 230 Congressman Charles Rose of North Carolina, a member of the House Select Commit tee on Intelligence, has attended classified demonstrations of remote vi ewing arranged by the CIA. \"I've seen some incredible examples of remote viewing~so much so that we ought to pay close attention to development s in this field,\" says Congressman Rose. 231 18. Drugs Drugs, including LSD and marijuana ,have been teste d alone and in combination with hypnosis on knowing and unknowing subjects by the CIA and other government intelligence agencies in o rder to find reliable ways to control the mind and human behavior. 232 Consciousness-altering drugs have been an important part of many religions for centuries. 233 In the Vedas, holy books written in India between 2000 and 1400 B.C., the god Siva is said to have brought marijuana from the Him alayas for man's benefit. A liquid preparation called \"bhang\" was de scribed in the 10th century as the \"food of the gods.\" 234 The peoples of Africa and the Indians of South America have used a variety of psychoactive d rugs. The Incas of Peru chewed the leaves of the sacred coca plants. 235 The Indians of North America believed that the visions produced by the plant dru gs were glimpses of a world on a different plane of reality, inhabited by spirits who provided useful information. 236 In every part of the world, almost all communities had their medicine men, witch doctors or shamans, selected pr imarily for their ability to communicate with the spirits. To visit the spiri t world, the medicine man entered a state of trance, and this was frequently accomplished with the help of drugs. His function was to bring back useful inf ormation for his people. 237 Historical evidence links the use of certain plant drugs with the ability to practice divination.

The Secret of Marijuana Throughout history, marijuana has been used to trea t dozens of different diseases and conditions. 239 Chinese Emperor Shen Nung classified it in the Herbal, an equivalent of the U.S. Pharmacopoeia as an important medicine at about 2730 B.C. and taught his people how to gro w it. 240 In the 15th century in India, it was believed to have numerous medical virtues. Documents from the 1500's show that English herbali sts were using it as medicine, as were folk healers in Poland, Russia an d Lithuania. During the 17th and 18th centuries, there were more references to it in medical texts. Between 1839 and 1900, there were more than one hun dred published studies of marijuana as a medicine. 241 Potential medical uses include controlling nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy, treatment of glaucoma by reducing excessive pressure within the eye, mana gement of muscular spasms, control of epileptic seizures, treatment of asthma by increasing the diameter of the air passages of the lungs, relief o f pain, treatment of migraine, treatment of anorexia nervosa by stimulat ing the appetite, anti- anxiety and sleep-inducing effects, treatment of de pression, treatment of alcoholism and opiate dependence, reduction of high blood pressure. 242 The American Medical Association has maintained a p osition on marijuana closely allied to mat of the Federal Bureau of Narc otics. The Journal of the American Medical Association disregards as \"unscien tific\" any study that does not demonstrate marijuana to be a \"menace.\" 243 In their 1967 statement, the Committee on Alcoholism and Drug Dep endence of the American Medical Association began with the asserti on that \"cannabis (marijuana) has no known use in medical practice in most countries of the world, including the United States.\" 244 In 1937, members of the Committee on Legislative Activities of the American Medical A ssociation wrote in protesting the impending Marijuana Tax Act: \"There is positively no 43"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"evidence to indicate the abuse of cannabis as a med icinal agent or to show that its medicinal use is leading to the developmen t of cannabis addiction.\" 245 In June 1980, the UNIMED Pharmaceutical Company ap plied to the Food and Drug Administration for approval to market THC, the active component of marijuana, under the trade name \"Marinol.\" 246 A major effect of the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act was to drive prices up for marijuana to make its cultivation and distribution profitable. 247 Where a plant drug can be exploited commercially, its use h as been encouraged. The opium trade was encouraged by commercial interests in Western nations, particularly Great Britain. The League of Nations O pium Committee meeting in Geneva in 1925 was called \"The Smugglers ' Reunion.\" 248 Governments are the real drug pushers.

Beliefs acquired during childhood indoctrination at home, school and church often masquerade as knowledge. Such indoctrination means that the indiv idual takes on conclusions of others instead of arriving at his ow n.

The Origin of Man When Charles Darwin's Origin of Species was publish ed in 1859, there was considerable opposition to the whole idea of evolut ion because it challenged the Biblical story of Creation. The controversy con tinues to this day. Evolution and Darwinism, however, do not mean the s ame thing even though they are often misunderstood as being the sa me. Evolution is a process of change. Evolution of life over a very lo ng period of time is a fact based on evidence from geology, paleontology, molec ular biology and other scientific disciplines. Darwinism, on the other han d, is a theory that tries to explain evolution, and despite many efforts, it has not been proved. Darwin believed that new species evolved out of existing o nes, that fish evolved into amphibians, amphibians into reptiles, reptiles into birds, and ultimately man evolved from an ape-like ancestor as the result of gradually accumulated improvements. But fossils showing key t ransitions from one life form to another have never been found. The fos sil record often reveals a pattern of evolutionary leaps rather than the gradu al changes Darwin foresaw. 256 The appearance of modern man on this planet was sud den. 257 Darwin and the evolutionists found no Missing Link between man and the ape because man is not the evolutionary culmination of the primates . 258 The origin of Man described in Genesis is an allegorical explanation of what happened. Allegory is a way to describe something that is pro found in terms of something simple. It is a symbolic representation o f fact; it is not the fact itself. A literal interpretation of the allegory ma kes the allegory more important than what it was meant to represent. 259 Fundamentalists make 45"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"this error.

It was necessary for Man to exper ience a finite world and dwell within the confines of materials to know phys ical hmitations in order to appreciate the lack of limitation and the respon sibilities it carries. They observed the evolving organic species. Creating phy sical bodies by the power of thought or by invading the bodies of anima ls, a group cohabited with the animal forms evolving upon this planet and taught those practices to others. The crossing of man's spirit with animal s produced a race of hybrids. Animals and men became interchangeable. Th e Sphinx with a lion's body and human head is symbolic of this sequ ence in man's history. There were divine animals and beastly divinities. T he 18th Chapter of Leviticus, verses 22-30 refers to this period of so domic practices when man cohabited with animal forms. The Fall of the Angels referred to by theologians was Man's descent into flesh and the sp iritual degeneration which resulted, making the process of reincarnation necessary so that man could work his way back to his original condition a nd proceed to greater heights of achievement. 260 \"Why think ye that flesh developed a mechanism of r easoning brain if not for high employment?

Pelley investigated the principles of survival of the human spirit and cultivated his own psychic abi litites. The body of work that came to be The Golden Scripts was dictated to him. \"Know ye, beloved, that in the beginning man had no image by physical body. Intellect was. Men were created Spirit by Spi rit. Know ye that intellect sought flesh for a purpose. Spirit as spi rit hath no identity; only after long experience on planes of matter doth spir it feel its essence. Thus cometh identity: through trial and through error, t hrough life as mortal being. Man was divine from the beginning, a thought -force of the Father, knowing good and evil, creating no material thing w ithout a loving purpose. I tell you, man was to rule as god over sy stems of planets one day to be within his control. Yet did man embrace his o pportunity to make himself god of earth-creation without gaining to ex perience; thus did he fill the earth with his thought-forms. What think ye is the meaning of the Fable of Sodom? Having monsters by his making, he did hav e of them whoredoms; he did bring upon his species an appalli ng catastrophe. Thus correcteth he a wrong through his fleshly visitatio ns, that by Overcoming the weaknesses and desires of his flesh, he cleanse th himself of mat which defiled him. Thus hath he known earth-life, aeon un to aeon, form unto form, body unto body.\" 261 Man is a blend of indigenous ape-forms and the cele stial beings who arrived upon this planet and adopted the primate organic bo dy because of the greater dexterity possessed with the hand and thumb. They c ohabited with me primate forms and the progeny was the first true ma n. The inheritance of animal traits still lingers in man, making so many spiritual beings beastly in their temperaments and behaviors. Only through m uch instruction and experience in all stations of human life could man win back his original standards of celestial intelligence.

Powers of the Mind The great secret possessed by the great men of all ages has been their ability to release the powers of their subconscious mind. 265 Your subconscious mind accepts as true whatever your conscious mind b elieves to be true. What the conscious mind believes, the subconscious acts on. It works like programming a computer. You feed information into a computer, and the computer acts on it. However, if the information yo u feed into the computer is wrong, it still acts on it! If you give yourself incorrect information or if others give you incorrect information, the memory b anks of your subconscious mind do not correct me error but act o n it! The conscious mind cannot be controlled by me suggestions of some one else when those suggestions are contrary to what you know from your own experience. But the subconscious mind is amenable to control by sug gestion, by you and others. The subconscious mind can be manipulated wi thout conscious awareness as evidenced by me phenomenon of sublimin al perception. The most effective way to protect yourself from subcons cious manipulation is to be aware of how it works. The techniques used to en slave the mind are the same used to free it. This amounts to re-programmin g me subconscious mind to break past conditioning and restore itself to its healthy functioning. To do this requires an understanding of the interac tion between the conscious mind and the subconscious. 48"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Meditation is a method of clearing the mind as prep aration for a mental discipline of a much higher order. The principles b ehind meditation are the same as those for mental programming: distraction a nd repetition. Distraction focuses the attention of the conscious mind on one or more of the five senses in order to program the subconsciou s mind. Repetition of a mantra, a word or several words, or focusing your a ttention on something visual, real or imaginary, is the program. The tool s of the conscious mind are words (spoken, written and thought) and picture s and sounds. The conscious mind discriminates, evaluates, accepts or rejects. The subconscious responds to the suggestions your consc ious mind gives to it. 266 The power of suggestion is the power of belief. It is an act of faith. Jesus said: \"According to your faith be it unto you \" (Matthew 9:29). This is the foundation of all mental programming. \"Whatsoev er ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.\" 267 Think back to the times when you have been upset an d without thinking you automatically began to breathe in deeply and ra pidly to calm down and get yourself back together. Now breathe in slowly a nd deeply and exhale in the same fashion, slowly and deeply. You are feelin g more relaxed. Pantanjali, an Indian sage who codified the practic e of yoga in the second century A.D., wrote that control of thoughts and em otions is linked to breath control. Modern scientists are proving what ancient philosophers often believed to be true: that breathing affects o ur mental, emotional, and physical well-being. Dr. Rudolph Ballentine of the Himalayan Institute, a yogic research center in Pennsylvania, says that \"b reathing is directly related in a very strategic way to the functioning of the i nternal organs, the emotions and the mind.\" Changing the way you breath e can change the way your brain works, giving you conscious control over your blood pressure, metabolism, emotions, brain waves and mind. 268 Now go back to early childhood experience and see y ourself as a tiny tot long before school age, even before you could speak , untouched and unspoiled by the adult world.

Conclusion The world becomes increasingly more confused and ch aotic as reason departs from men's thoughts and actions. The outside world duplicates the state of inner man. So long as there is a difference between what life is and what men think life should be, there will be conflict. A nd conflict is caused by what we think. The problems in the world are the re sult of men believing things that are not true. A man can live well only if he knows clearly what is the end of life, what things are of real value, and how they are to be attained. If a man thinks that the end of life is t o gain wealth and power, all his actions will be misdirected. What we are, where we come from, and why we are here are basic life questions. How we resolv e these questions steers the course of our lives and within these questions is the reason for our being here. Men resent that which departs from what they have learned from tradition, unless they make such a discovery for th emselves from their own personal experience. For there to be a change in ho w men deal with one another, there must be a change within the individu al first. Inner change brings about outward change. And change is caused b y something happening—an event or a series of events. An out-of-body experience is a natural phenomenon. Everyone has this experience while asleep, and often when awake witho ut knowing it. The physical body is asleep and the conscious mind is t otally aware of what is going on but from a different point of view. Think back to the times when you have been between that twilight state where you are not asleep but yet not fully awake. Sometimes while in this twilight s tate, you may have experienced the sensation of falling and awoke with a start and may have also experienced momentary dizziness. It is at this point where your spirit is re-aligning with your physical body.

In the novel Lost Horizon, author James Hi lton refers to the practice of \"drug-taking and deep breathing exercis es.\" 271 It is the reason for the longevity of the High Lama of Shangri-La.

Postscript In 1980, I was given the results of eleven years of private research investigating hypnosis. Experiments had been conduc ted with voice and language patterns as a means to induce different le vels of the hypnotic state of mind. Language was used to create sounds by vary ing inflection and pacing to guide the listener from one altered state to another. This unfunded research resulted in the development of a mental pr ogramming tape that helps the listener identify different levels of min d, enter them at will and function in them for extended periods. This program ming tape has been used under medical supervision to facilitate behavior mo dification, control pain and aid the treatment of various pulmonary diseases . I studied the tape and other materials which included books, notes, sound and music tapes. I conducted experiments and began what has become an adventure. The first experiments were conducted with the progr amming tape and other music and sound tapes such as high and low frequenc y Tibetan bells, Hindu, Buddhist and Islamic meditative chanting. Though so me experiments were conducted with volunteers and some experiments with sound were conducted on unknowing subjects, I experimented more and more on myself and made note of the effects. I experimented extensively wit h meditation and added to it a regimen of marijuana and deep breathing exerci ses, using marijuana in what I later learned to be the traditional shamanis t way. Unusual, paranormal events occurred and were observ ed with detachment and an open mind, revealing a different way of looking at the world. I looked at movies differently. I listened to sounds in a diffe rent way. I studied the movies that were being shown on 42nd Street in New York City and observed the reactions of a very vocal and responsi ve audience.

Support for such a project was not forthcoming which led to an investigation of the use of subliminal techniques in the communications media. Those findings are contained in this document. It is not intended to be complete, but representative of what is happening in America and around the world.
