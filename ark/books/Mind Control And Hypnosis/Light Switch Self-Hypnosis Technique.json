[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Light Switch Self-Hypnosis Technique Gerald F. Kein This is the technique I developed over many years for teaching extremely deep somnambulistic self-hypnosis in one simple session. First make sure you have the client in somnambulism. The Elman induction is my prefered way to accomplish this. Then Say: We can go ahead and relax you mentally and physically much more, but it really is... not that necessary. Because to learn the secrets of control over your body doesn't require that we become physical or mental zombies. It just requires that our mind is open to accept suggestions of learning... and now we're going to begin to teach you how to hypnotize yourself, beautifully. I want you to do this... I want you to use that powerful ability to imagine that (God, nature, etc.) gave you. If you are a visual person... make a picture. Some people aren't visual, but if you are... make a picture... but if you aren't visual, you can imagine. Imagine or visualize what I'm about to describe. I'm about to describe two things to you. I want you to imagine them strongly, or picture them with great clarity, which ever is easier for you. Don't question it. Success will depend on you following these instructions. I want you to imagine or visualize yourself first standing at the top of a long staircase. It extends straight down in front of you. As you look down this staircase... decorate it, carpet it any way you want to, it's yours. As you look down the staircase you notice something very unusual about it... and that is, it never seems to end... it just goes on and on. Now that's because this is the staircase of relaxation... and we have never found an end to a persons ability to relax. And I want you now to accept this suggestion, that from this moment on when you're in this beautiful state... every gentle breath you exhale... guides you deeper... and deeper. Every breath... takes you down another step on this beautiful staircase. Every breath... takes you down... more... and more. Seal that within you. Now this is the most important thing that you're going to learn. So I want you to imagine and seal this next suggestion within you more than anything else you've ever done in your life... because it will give you the ability... to improve your life in so many ways. I want you to first imagine or visualize your brain. I'm going to use the word imagine from now on. That will mean either imagine something or visualize it if you're one of those people that can create a picture. But rather than say imagine or visualize I'll just say imagine, it'll mean either one for you. You imagine that coming down from the base of your brain is a fairly thick electrical cable, maybe about as thick as the pinky finger on your hand. After it comes down Page 1 of 5"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"about an inch, I want you to imagine it goes into the top of a light switch... you know, like the light switch that operates the ceiling lamps in your bathroom or your kitchen at home. Imagine that cable coming out the bottom of that switch. The jacket, the cover of the cable opens up... and from it, flows hundreds of little bitsy tiny wires... that flow through every muscle and cell of your body from the top of your head to the tip of your toes. In a moment I'm going to ask you move that switch from the \"on\"... down... to the \"off\" position. Now here's the suggestion that I need you to accept... and you must accept it... if you want be able to powerfully program yourself quickly and easily. When you move that light switch to the down position, you'll accept the suggestion you voluntarily, without any question... block all electrical current from your brain to every muscle in your body that's not needed for continued survival. Instantly every muscle will go totally dormant... unable to move... no matter how hard you may try. Should I ask you to try to lift a hand a finger or open an eye or even speak... when that switch is \"off\"... nothing works. Make that your reality... with this understanding... that it is your switch. You can turn it on or you can turn it off, anytime you want to. But you must accept the suggestion that when it's \"off\"... all the muscles of your body grow completely dormant, unable to move. Now when you do that, you're going to notice something else... another benefit comes in. If there's the slightest stress or tension in you anyplace, instantly when you move that switch off that can no longer exist... and you'll feel yourself go many times deeper relaxed. All right. In your mind... reach up... grab hold of that switch that you have created... and now firmly move it... down.... to the off position...shutting down every muscle, every nerve, every fiber... blocking the electric current in that switch just as if you turned a light switch off... the lights go off... and feel your body relax much deeper. Now if you've accepted that suggestion, right now every muscle in your body is totally shut down unable to move, no matter how hard you may try. Because this is the most important part of your training... that you must accept this... I'm now going to find out if that is your reality. With your light switch in the off position, blocking all the electrical current to every muscle in your body...try to lift your right hand. (PAUSE) Wonderful. Stop trying... and go much deeper. With that light switch completely \"off\"...try to lift your left hand. (PAUSE) That's great. Stop trying and go deeper. So we know the right brain and the left brain have accepted that. Now for the ultimate test. Know that light switch blocks that electrical current. Believe it with all your heart. Seal it within you. With that light switch in the off position blocking that electrical current...try to open Page 2 of 5"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"your eyes. (Pause) Great. Stop trying. Go much deeper relaxed. You're doing beautifully. The secret to the technique you're going to learn, is when you move that switch to the off position... that you know, it's not a matter of believing, it's a matter of knowing... that you know you shut down every muscle in your body. This is a beautiful state that you're in. Right now, you have a natural anesthesia that comes in, in this beautiful level. I'm going to show you what I mean. Without any suggestions of any kind of an anesthesia what-so- ever, I'm just going to be doing some general testing on you. As I work with you, just feel yourself relaxing even more, it just feels good to do it. (ARM PINCH, JAW PINCH etc.) I'm going to lift your right hand and drop it and when I do... this beautiful anesthesia... and the physical part of you deep inside... relaxes much more. (RIGHT HAND DROP) That's good. Repeat practice as necessary until client is confident in the results. Now, I'm going to teach you how to enter this state by yourself. But before I do, between now and the next time I see you, you're going to be practicing self- hypnosis a lot. Until now and the next time I see you this going to be very important. When you move your switch \"off\"... under no circumstances ... are you ever to override the suggestion, that every muscle in your body is turned off. Now when you're practicing you'll discover that maybe some day you get an itchy nose, or you want to move your body... you're not in total comfort for some reason... fine, but first move your light switch back \"on\"... then scratch or move your body... then move your light switch \"off\". Your light switch is a tool. You are never to override, the light switch. When it's \"off\", you're \"off\", no exceptions. You must believe this, you must accept this... if you want to have real relief during your childbirth. But it's a switch... and your switch can be turned \"on\" or \"off\" depending on what you want it to do. All right. Now here's how you're going to enter this state. First I'm going to give you two safety suggestions, because each time you enter this state you're going to find you go tremendously deeper than the time before. So you're only going to practice this when you are in a safe and comfortable position... like in a chair that supports your body or lying at home in a bed or something like that. Don't do it in a straight backed chair for example. As you grow more relaxed and learn this technique, you'll just fall out of that chair, there's no support. You will be in a safe and comfortable position. Second you'll give yourself a time limit. You're going to tell yourself, \"I'm entering self-hypnosis for...\" and you're going to say a time. For practice now we're going to use thirty seconds. At home (this week, etc.) I want you to vary it, from thirty seconds to about two minutes. Mix it up a little bit. You can do it longer if you want to, but I don't want to take a lot of your day up here. You'll say to yourself, \"I'm going into Page 3 of 5"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"deep self-hypnosis, right now, for thirty seconds.\" Then here's how you'll enter the state. After you've told yourself the time, you'll raise and lower your right index finger. When it touches what ever it might be resting on at that time... the arm of the chair, your leg, the bed, whatever... when it touches what ever it's resting on... and this important... not before, after it touches... you'll close your eyes... you'll go right back down into this beautiful state. You'll instantly move your light switch at the same time you close your eyes... from the \"on\" to the \"off\" position... shutting down every muscle, nerve and fiber... and go right back into this beautiful state. Then you'll do nothing. Do not think of the time... that will foul you up all the time... just enjoy the beautiful state. Your subconscious mind keeps better time than your conscious mind ever possibly could. It'll give you a feeling, a hunch that your time is up. When you feel your time is up... you'll flip your switch \"on\"... your eyes will open... you'll grow fully alert... feeling fantastic. So let me review that because we're going to practice it now. First you'll be in a safe and comfortable position... as you are here. Second, you'll give yourself a time limit. You'll say to yourself, \"I'm now going into self-hypnosis for thirty seconds.\" Third, you'll raise your index finger and drop it. When it touches and not before... you'll close your eyes... move your light switch to the \"off\" position, shutting your body down completely... and go back to this state, each time deeper. Don't think of anything, on purpose... and your subconscious mind will tell you when the time is up. You'll always have thoughts... don't worry about that, as long as you're not creating them. Then when you have a hunch your time is up, you'll simply flip your light switch \"on\"... your eyes will open, fully alert... and when you do, notice how good you feel. All right, at the count of three and not before move your switch to the \"on\" position... and open your eyes and we'll practice this technique. One... two... three, move the switch \"on\", let your eyes open, notice how good you feel. A nice feeling isn't it ? Remember, the most important thing now is to get that switch \"off\". Have your client practice the technique with a thirty second time limit 3-5 times. After the client emerges, ask: Do you feel like you really got your switch off? If no have client practice more. If yes , tell client to enter self-hypnosis without a time limit and that you will emerge him. After he is in the state, say the following: Now, I want to talk to your subconscious mind... you can listen with your consciousness if you want to... but I want to talk to your subconscious mind. Then say: \"When (Client’s name) tells you a time... you're to do that time exactly. If she tells you thirty seconds that does not mean twenty - nine... it does not mean thirty - one. If Page 4 of 5"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"he/she tells you one minute... that does not mean sixty-one seconds or fifty-nine seconds. You will follow his/her instructions instantly. Now listen very carefully to me. You're doing beautiful, you're going to do fantastic. You are now going to put your mind to school. Between now and the next time that I see you... you're going to practice using this time limit technique... and you're going to practice it ten times a day... minimum. Now that may sound like a lot of time. But say, if you gave yourself a time limit of one minute... well that's only ten minutes a day. If you gave yourself thirty seconds that's only five minutes a day... and I know you're willing to invest that amount of time... for having a beautiful loving birth. So you'll do that, ten times a day... once a day without fail. You're going to listen to a very powerful... self-hypnosis deepening tape program... that I'm going to give you. (Give them a progressive relaxation induction with a 15 second blank leader in the beginning.) Here's how this works. You'll put the tape in a tape player, you'll get yourself in a nice comfortable position, you'll push the play button on the tape recorder... nothing happens for about twenty seconds. There's just twenty seconds of blank tape. During that twenty seconds you'll enter self-hypnosis without a time limit as you've just done. You'll go into hypnosis , you'll get your switch \"off\". After that my voice will come on... and guide you tremendously deep into this state. Each time you use this very special tape, you'll feel yourself go very... very deep... much deeper than the time before. You'll use this tape once a day... without fail. You'll find that if you follow these two instructions, when I see you next week, you'll instantly be able to go into such a beautiful deep state of hypnosis... you'll probably think you're living on the planet Mongo instead of here. But it will be wonderful... and a loving experience. I'll give you the written instructions on this... so you'll have it all. Just know there is no basement to your ability to relax. Any limitations on your ability to relax merely are your limitations... and those aren't real. You can relax much more deeply than you've ever, thought possible. In my next article I’ll discuss how, using this technique, the client can give himself transformational suggestions so powerfully that they will take effect instantly. Page 5 of 5"}]
