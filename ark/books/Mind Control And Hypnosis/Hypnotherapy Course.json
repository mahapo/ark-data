The Uncommon Knowledge Diploma in Hypnotherapy and Psychotherapy is unlike any other because it puts hypnosis into perspective as part of wider psychology, enabling you to be flexible and versatile in its use. Uncommon Knowledge takes as the starting point for therapy the factors that every individual needs to live a healthy, satisfying life. This simplifying and clarifying approach allows theory and technique to fall away, opening up a clear view of what it is to be human, and what we need to avoid emotional problems and perform at our best. From this foundation grows a uniquely focused and effective skill-set, utilising the latest developments from the fields of hypnosis, psychology and therapy, creating Uncommon Therapists that are confident, knowledgeable, and above all – effective. “This course has given me great personal development - attitudes and techniques which have made me already a more rounded person,and given me the start of a professional extension which will make me a better doctor and therapist.” Dr Peter Bellamy, therapist and retired GP 2"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Up-to-date and effective – so you only have to train once The greatest criticism of hypnotherapy, psychotherapy and counseling training in the UK today has to be the focus on theory, rather than efficacy. Read the materials for other training courses and you will be baffled by technical jargon and archaic terminology. On many hyp- notherapy, psychotherapy and counselling courses you will spend precious hours writing essays on the ideas of historical fig- ures or learning ‘technical manuals’, rather than focusing on learning what is helpful to you and those you will help. “A well structured and enlightened course... ...set it apart from the clinical, narrowly focused, theoretical and prescriptive approaches of some of the London schools. Excellent. Thank you.” Guy Baglow, Corporate Financier Personal or professional development? Different people have different reasons for attending the course. Some graduates use their qualification to set up their own fu ll time practice, or develop a second income. Some are already therapists, adding to their existing skill-set. Others, however, put their learning to a different use. These are people looking to enhance their communication skills, increa se their confidence and look after their own mental health. In today’s fast paced, high stress environments, more and more peo- ple are finding it difficult to cope. The ability to relax properly, be aware of damaging thought processes, develop positive thinking styles and effectively use our resources is invaluable. And as Daniel Goleman says in his brilliant book Emotional Intelligence, it’s those with ‘people skil ls’ that allow people to get ahead. Join the growing band of Uncommon Therapists Demand for effective therapists is increasing year-on-year. Public awareness of the varying efficacies of different therapies i s growing, and people are seeking brief, solution-focused therapy that can help them quickly. Uncommon Therapists charge between £50 and £100, meaning your course investment can be repaid within 40 sessions. 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Course features 4 • Free membership of HypnosisDownloads.com from Uncommon Knowledge gives you examples of scripts for many different problems.

As Milton Erickson, father of modern therapy, said when asked about his theory of psychotherapy, “I invent a new theory for each client who walks through the door!” “I thoroughly enjoyed the course and feel that it has changed my own circumstances immensely. I use what I’ve learnt daily and know I feel more optimistic. Some years ago I took a child psychology course and found it was quite depressing and I was fully aware having been in therapy with my children that going over the past was not changing the present for them. So this course was enlightening. I dearly hope to use my qualification and am discussing at the present time with another colleague the possibility of going into practice.” Edwina Sheer, Housewife “This is a life-changing course and very rewarding. Not only does it offer new tools and strategies for life, it also presents whole new perspectives on it. I enjoyed it immensely.” Jane Raven, Careers Advisor, Sussex “I was very attracted by the balance of the course, between theory / practical / home study. The course gave me the confidence to deal with clients. I have progressed rapidly on a personal development basis and I use solution focused language and reframing instinctively at work and outside. I feel very empowered to have a cluster of skills to help other people and appreciate seeing the bigger picture. Thank you!

Having run hypnosis training workshops for several years in their local area, they decided to pursue training on a full-time basis. Within 6 months, Uncommon Knowledge was running workshops in 6 different locations around England. Since then, over 400 diploma trainees have graduated, many of whom are now working as hypnotherapists. The company’s mission is to spread sound, useful information and skills around psychology, psychotherapy and hypnosis. The trainers Mark Tyrrell DHyp, EH.P, NLP-BHR, HGDip Mark trains thousands of health professionals and members of the public every year.

She will be available throughout your training to help you with the practicalities of the course and give you the benefit of her own experience. Reliable, efficient and friendly, Louise will make your path through the Diploma course smooth and easy! A quick word from the trainers The Diploma course was created as we saw a gap in training in the UK. Although there are too many hypnotherapy schools to mention, there are few delivering quality training in effective methods. Many courses have become cumbersome, teaching out-of-date ‘directive’ methods and engaging students in studies that are more of a historical nature than therapeutic. We have worked hard to create a training course which is both stimulating and practical and we are confident that you will find the experience rewarding, enlightening and enjoyable. For us, there is nothing better than seeing our trainees surprise themselves with their abilities to help people. The supervisors Trained and experienced supervisors will be on hand throughout the course to help with practice sessions and any queries you may have. All supervisors have completed the course themselves and will be currently practicing.

The theory and practical techniques the course has taught have helped enormously in this direction. Moreover, the practical experience of the course had reframed my attitude to working with clients to the extent that I now feel that I can offer something of real value.
