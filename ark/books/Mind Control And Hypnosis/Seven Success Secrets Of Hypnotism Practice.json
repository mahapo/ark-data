[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Seven Success Secrets of Hypnotism Practice Many misconceptions about success persist in this work and hopefully I can help you clear your mind so that you might maximize your effectiveness. The first prerequisite for success is a four letter word: \"W.O.R.K.\" But hard work alone is not enough if you work without knowledge or without an awareness of what your efforts are producing. Everyone here is obviously willing and interested in doing the work and no one here believes that if you pray or chant enough affirmations that bags of money will fall from the sky in front of you. #1 MAKING THE APPOINTMENT The first session begins with the telephone call. All of you are educated enough not to use terms such as \"patient\" or \"cure\" or \"treatment\". We don't have any patients and we don't treat anyone. We are a hypnotism center - I am speaking to those of you who are not licensed in the healing arts. This is a hypnotism center and we give self-hypnosis, group and private hypnosis sessions. We use hypnosis as an educational process to help clients deal with certain goals, problems and motivations. In the early part of my career, I did almost all of the phone answering. If you are beginning your career and you feel that you are too important to answer your phone and you let the office helper do it, you are losing business. Your office helper does not understand the nature of your work, even if it is someone close to you. You are the only one who fully understands what you do and your methods of operation. You should take as many phone calls as you possibly can. There will come a time when you will be too busy to answer the phone and you may have to let someone else answer for you. Your main concern is to turn the inquiry into an appointment for the first session. When they ask, \"Can hypnosis help me with my problem?\" I reply, \"The first step is for you to come in for a session and in that time I will test you to determine your level of response. I will discuss your problems and goals and at the end of that time I will tell you if hypnosis is indicated for you, how long it will take and what the cost of the program will be.\" # 2 THE INTAKE INTERVIEW Once the client arrives I spend the first fifteen minutes allowing them to present their problem and completing the intake form. Then I say to them, \"How can I help you today?\" and they begin to tell me their problem. If you learn the art of intense listening, you are likely to discover the problem in the first five minutes. During the intake interview I interact, I communicate, I ask questions, I clarify and I feed back. When"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"you are using the process correctly, the client will come to know several things, in the first Fifteen minutes. One: that you are not just hearing them, but you are listening and focusing your full awareness and conscious attention upon them. Two: they become aware that you are analyzing, interpreting and evaluating by the feed back that you give them ... \"I hear you saying,\" or \"I understand that,\" or \"it seems as if,\" then they can confirm, deny or correct. \"Oh, I didn't mean it that way, what I am really saying is...\" or \"Oh, yes, that's right.\" Three: as they become aware that you are relating to them in a therapeutic process, your rapport is being developed in the non-hypnotic interview. They become convinced that you are interested in them and care about them, you devoted your full attention to them and that you are really a very wise person. #3 THE PRE-HYPNOTIC INTERVIEW The first question is, \"Have you ever been hypnotized before today?\" (implies that they are about to be hypnotized.) They will reply \"Yes\" or \"No.\" If they answer \"yes\", ask \"Was it for therapeutic purposes or for entertainment, as in a night club?\" They may answer, \"Well, a friend hired a hypnotist to entertain at a party and he hypnotized five or six others, but I didn't go under.\" Ask for the details, say, \"Will you tell me about your lack of response?\" \"Well, we sat in chairs and he said everyone put your hands together, press them tightly together, and now they are stuck. Try to pull your hands apart,' and I was the only one who did. So he dismissed me.\" Respond to that by saying, \"It is difficult to relax enough to concentrate on those ideas in front of a group of people, especially if you are a little anxious that you might be asked to do something silly.\" Suppose they say, \"Oh, yes, I went up on the stage in a night club and the last thing I remember is being told to try to pull my hands apart and the next thing I knew it was an hour later. When I went back to my seat, they told me I sang, and danced and did funny things while on the stage.\" You now have additional information. You know they went into a deep trance easily. If they say it was for therapeutic purposes, again you ask, \"Who was it?\" and have them tell you all the details. \"Well, I went to the therapist and I felt like I was floating on a cloud.\" Store that because when you hypnotize them, you will want to use it as feedback, \"Now you are getting that feeling of floating on a cloud.\" Take everything they say of a positive nature, about their previous hypnotic experience and feed it back to them. Why ask yourself, \"What kind of deepening techniques shall I use?\" when they have already told you. If they say to you, that they don't remember very much of what went on in the therapist's office, again you have similar input of information. The key question at this point is, \"Was this beneficial to you. Did you get the results that you hoped for? - tell me about it.\" When they report positive results they"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"have told you, \"I had a belief in hypnosis and I tried it and it worked for me. Therefore, here in this moment with you Mr. Hypnotist, I have a tremendously high mental expectancy. My imagination is already excited. Don't expend a lot of time on me doing all of those preparatory things, I've already told you my story. I went to a hypnotist and got good results.\" Take one more step and say, \"That is wonderful. Now, tell me, do you remember how you were hypnotized, what method was used, what can you tell me?\" They will tell you whether it was someone who believes in swinging a watch or using flashing lights or just what the experience was, or you might ask \"Have you ever been hypnotized?\" They reply, \"No, I have never made an effort to be hypnotized.\" \"Have you ever seen anyone hypnotized?\" \"Oh, yes. My friend was hypnotized on the stage, and - . Now you have some input. \"What did you think of all that?\" \"I just could never understand how she could get up there and sing a song. I know her and she is quite shy. I could not figure out if she was faking it or what.\" This is an opportunity for re-education. You say, \"The reason she was able to sing on stage, is that the critical factor of her conscious mind was temporarily closed down because she was in trance. The part of her mind that says, \"you are making a fool of yourself, everyone is looking at you and you should feel embarrassed,\" was silent. Because she did not hear that voice within, she was able to do something that is quite within the natural capacity of any human being, to sing a song or do a dance. It had nothing to do with her values, which includes her character attitudes, her religious beliefs and her moral principles.\" They often reply, \"Oh, I never thought of it that way. I just thought they would tell me that I would not normally do anything under hypnosis that I would not normally do and I would never normally get up in front of a crowd and sing a song.\" Now you have communicated and you are into the process of re-education. When you ask, \"Are you ready for me to hypnotize you?\" you can get a great deal of information from their answer. \"Well, if you think you can?\" or maybe, \"O.K, good luck.\" or \"Yes, I hope so.\" and sometimes they may say to you, \"No - I'm not ready!\" \"Alright, if you are not ready, tell me about it.\" \"I did not come today to get hypnotized. I think I will just talk to you.\" \"That's all right. You have reserved the time and we can spend the Lime talking and I am not going to hypnotize you until you tell me that you are ready for me to hypnotize you.\" They may say \"No\" just to test you to see what will happen and five minutes later they might say, \"I am ready now... I was anxious before, but now I feel more relaxed.\" At this point, it is time to hypnotize this person using whatever methods that seem appropriate to you. Whatever methods you use on that first session, I suggest that after the induction of trance, you begin a relaxation process because you want to get the full discharge of accumulated tensions and make the First session the best session. In the first session there is no attempt at"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"therapy, at least, not in an observable way. Many clients have said, \"I went deepest, the very first time.\" What they mean is, \"I had stored so many accumulated physical and emotional tensions that when I discharged them, I got rid of a tremendous load.\" # 4 TESTING THE SUBJECT In the pre-hypnotic talk I ask, \"Have you ever been hypnotized before?\" The answer is usually \"No.\" Then I ask, \"Have you ever made an effort to be hypnotized before today?\" Often they say, \"Yes, several times, but no one has ever hypnotized me.\" Then I ask, \"was it for entertainment or therapy?\" They reply, \"I had a problem that I wanted to deal with.\" \"What kind of therapist was it that you went to?\" (This is very important because you want to find out if it were their neighbor who is a certified public accountant and does hypnotism demonstrations as a hobby; or a psychologist or psychiatrist, whose hypnotism skills are of ten the same as the next door neighbors; or a trained hypnotherapist of experience and reputation in the community.) \"Tell me exactly what happened.\" \"He talked to me for a while, then he said to sit in the reclining chair and close my eyes while he repeated, 'You are getting drowsy and sleepy and you are going deeper and deeper into hypnosis.' He did that for quite a while, but I never went to sleep and I heard every word.\" \"Then what happened?\" \"Well when I arrived home my husband asked me, 'How did the hypnotism session go,' and I said, 'Well I am not sure.\"' \"What do you mean, you are not sure? Did you get hypnotized?\" \"I don't think so!\" \"You should know - were you hypnotized or not?\" \"Well, I don't think I was but the hypnotist said I was.\" \"I don't care what the hypnotist said, you should know. Did he lock your eyelids closed?\" \"Nope!\" \"Well then, you weren't hypnotized. How much did that cost you?\" \"Fifty dollars.\" \"You didn't make another appointment, did you?\" \"No!\" One of the measurements of your effectiveness is how many clients return after the first session. The first session is the one where they should be convinced and the rapport developed, so that the therapy is ready to begin. It is costs you a certain amount of time, energy and money, to bring that client into your office. If you only get paid for a single session, I doubt if you can recover the amount that it cost you to get the client into the office. Open the yellow pages for any large city and start calling the hypnotists' listings. From thirty to fifty percent of those listed are out of business. This happens because they place their ad five or six months before the directory comes out, and less than a year from ordering the ad they are no longer in business."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Clients fail to return because they were left with the feeling that they were not hypnotized. I met with a group of hypnotists at the Hilton Hotel in Baltimore and one of them said to me, \"I really confuse them, when they walk out of my place they do not know if they have been hypnotized. I tell them that is part of the mental confusion process.\" I thought to myself, \"At least he has found a way to put a positive view on his ineffectiveness.\" But, it still costs him money every day. Over the years that I have been in this work and heard these many stories, the question arises, why are the hypnotists losing these clients. What is it that they are failing to do? They are failing to test the subject to bring to the conscious mind the realization of the trance state. They don't test because they are afraid that the client will not respond in the way that the hypnotist believes appropriate and if they fail to respond, what will he do then? Suppose he tells them that their eyelids are locked closed and they open them. He's afraid that they will say \"Hey, Charlie, you did not hypnotize me, you had better give me my money back.\" That is not the way it works out, but that is the basis for the fear. You can't be successful in any line of endeavor when you operate from a background of fear. You must always operate from a background of feelings of competence. You will experience emotional and psychic burnout because your fear and anxiety will literally consume you. #5 INDUCING THE TRANCE Having completed the induction process and testing the subject, you are ready to take the next step. You are going to bring the conscious mind the realization of the trance state and you do that by giving three tests. An arm levitation, up to the chest, the chin or the head, and as the arm is lifting, you compound it with the second test, saying, \"As your arm is lifting, your eyes are locking closed and when you hand touches your body, your eyelids will be locked so tightly closed, the more you try to open them the tighter they are locking closed.\" At the same time, as the right arm is coming up, use the second suggestion: \"As your right arm is lifting your left arm feels as though it is made of marble or stone or lead\". Don't say that it IS made of stone, because it is not and you have to deal with what remains of a rational mind and you don't know how much that rational mind is active. Use the subjunctive mood to state a condition contrary to fact which says, \"your arm feels as if it is too heavy to lift.\" Use this wording: \"Your eyes have locked so tightly closed, the more you try to open them, the tighter they are locking closed and at the same time, you arm feels as though it is made of marble, lead or stone, it feels as if it is far too heavy to lift.\" This \"rule of reversed mental effort\" will generate a successful result in virtually every case. By contrast, in his book New Master Course in Hypnosis, (The New Master Course in Hypnosis, Harry Arons, Power Publishers, 1961), Harry Arons gives the wording for the arm catalepsy as follows: Your arm is outstretched before you, stiff and rigid like a bar of steel. You are completely powerless to bend or lower it. In fact the harder you try the more impossible it is, because you are in hypnosis, you see, and implicitly obedient to my every command. You simply cannot lower your arm until I SAY that you can! \"What you are doing here is impressing forcibly upon the subject's"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"consciousness that he is indeed under you \"hypnotic control\" -else why can he not do something so simple as lowering his arm? A suggestion may be made that a few minutes after awakening he would become aware of a terrible itching sensation in his back just between the shoulder blades, where it would be difficult to scratch. \"You will be very annoyed with this itching,\" you continue, \"and will go into all sorts of contortions to scratch this spot, even rubbing your back against the wall and against articles of furniture. But nothing will help. Finally, you will appeal for my help in the matter, because ONLY I will be able to relieve this itching. I will simply snap my fingers twice and the itching will disappear instantly. This will convince you beyond the shadow of a doubt that you are indeed under hypnosis. This wording is guaranteed to produce a high percentage of failures because: A. it openly challenges the subjects autonomy, B. it tells the subject that he is \"completely powerless\", \"implicitly obedient to my every command\", C. it mobilizes the subject's \"fear of losing control\", D. it erodes the subject's dignity: \"You will go into all sorts of contortions to scratch this spot, even rubbing your back against the wall and on articles of furniture.\" E. the overwhelming authoritarian style and conflict structured wording generates feelings of defiance from the subject. I urge you to avoid making these mistakes. Now let's return to the correct wording of these tests: \"Your left arm feels so heavy it feels AS IF it were far too heavy to lift, in fact even the very thought of trying to lift it seems to be more than you wish to deal with, at this time. You may, if you wish to, make an effort to lift your left arm. Now stop trying, relax and go deeper.\" Now we have done the arm levitation, the eye catalepsy and the heavy left arm tests. It is important to utilize all these tests so that you will get a response on at least one of them. Any response to a single test is 100% success. You have now finished the tests and you must explain their response. You say, \"The feeling that you felt, as your arm was lifting, that is the feeling of hypnosis. The feeling that you felt, as your eyelids seemed stuck, that is the feeling of hypnosis. The feeling that you felt as your left arm seemed so heavy, that is the feeling of hypnosis. I call these responses the feelings of hypnosis because you and I know that there is no rational reason for your right arm to feel lighter than your left. There is no rational reason for your eyelids not to open instantly on the mere thought. There is no rational reason for your left arm to feel heavier than your right. \"In the hypnotic trance, the critical factor of the conscious mind is temporarily relaxed. This is the part of your mind which examines incoming ideas for their rational content. Since that part of your mind is relaxed because of trance, you don't have any inhibitions about responding to irrational ideas; such as your right arm is lighter than your left; or your left arm is heavier than your right; or that your eyelids are stuck. Your mind is not asking a question, or making a statement such as, 'That's silly, my right arm feels the same as my left arm because that is the way it should be. I could open my eyelids any Lime I choose.' Because of this single change you are able to accept ideas that are different"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"from your previous experience. \"You might consider your mind to be like a stereo system with speakers on either side. When I turn the balance control knob all the way to the left, the music will pour out of the left speaker and the right speaker will become silent. The speaker has not disappeared nor has the circuitry to the speaker disappeared, it is just temporarily passive or inactive. When I turn the balance control knob the other way, the left speaker becomes passive and quiet, and the right speaker is activated once again. \"In the same way, one circuit, or one part of your mind, 'the critical factor,' is now temporarily relaxed, and this is the major change that occurs in the hypnotic state. This is what enables you to accept good, positive, beneficial and creative ideas that help you to do the very things that you have set out to do. in a moment, I am going to bring you up from this trance and when I do, you are going to have a much clearer understanding of your trance state when you open your eyes.\" #6 PROGRAMMING FOR FUTURE SUCCESS Be sure to give them these hypnotic suggestions. \"You are going to have a much clearer understanding of the nature of hypnosis when you open your eyes. You will have a much clearer understanding than you ever had about the nature of your conscious and subconscious mind. You will understand that it is most likely you heard every word that I said, even when you were in your trance. You will understand that you were not asleep in the manner that you sleep at night; that you experienced a wonderful state of physical, mental and emotional relaxation, or a sleep of your nervous system.\" You have two more things to do. The first one is to say; \"Before I bring you up from hypnosis, is there anything further you want to say to me, ask me or tell me.\" Give them the option to give you information. They might give any number of a variety of responses. Most times they will say \"No.\" The second thing, done at the end of each session of therapy, is to say, \"Quickly now, who do I remind you of\" You will get some very quick information about the projections they put on you. \"You remind me of my father.\" \"How am I like your father?\" \"Well he was a good friend, he was very understanding\" or \"You remind me of a minister,\" or \"a doctor,\" or \"a school teacher.\" I have had them say, \"You remind me of a judge.\" \"How am I like a judge?\" \"Well, I think you are very understanding.\" Probably that person had an experience with a judge maybe when he was a juvenile and now he is more understanding. it means that I am an authority figure and I am linked to some authority figure out of their experience. The most unusual one was when I said to a lady, \"Who do I remind you of?\" She replied, \"You remind me of the devil.\" I said, \"How am I like the devil?\" \"Because the devil knows everything.\" I said, \"Alright, I am going to count from ten down to one and we are going back"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"to a time that has to do with 'the devil knows everything\"' In the intake portion of her session, every time I fed back to her (\"I hear you saying...,\" or \"In other words...\"), she would say, \"Oh, my God, how did you figure that out?\" Finally, she said, \"You seem to know all about me.\" Now, she says that the devil knows everything. In the age regression, she was less than four years old and the family lived in a little house on the edge of town. Out behind the house was a small thicket of trees with a stream running through it. She loved to go back there to play, but something happened to change things - perhaps a child was molested, or some hobos were seen back there. One day, Mother said, \"You are not to go back in the woods any more,\" and when she asked, \"Why Mommy?\" she was told, \"Because the devil is living back there now and you know the devil carries off bad little girls.\" A few days later she did something that Mother thought was naughty and Mother said, \"If you don't stop being so naughty, the devil is going to come right into this house, put you under his arm and carry you right out of here.\" She asked, \"Marna, if the devil is back there in the woods, how does he know that I am naughty up here in the house?\" Her mother said, \"The devil knows everything.\" NEXT STEP: Terminate the trance. \"All right now, I am going to count from one to five and at the count of five your eyes are wide open, you are calm, rested, relaxed, fully aware and feel wonderfully good.\" (See the trance termination script.) First thing I always say is, \"Well, you kind of surprised yourself, didn't you?\" There are only three answers they can give: \"Yes,\" \"No\" or \"What do you mean?\" Whatever their response, your answer is always the same: \"Tell me about it.\" 1. You say, \"Kind of surprised yourself?\" \"Yes.” \"Tell me about it.\" \"Why, I really did not think I was hypnotized, but then I felt my arm jerking up and when I went to open my eyes they did not open. My left arm just felt like it was made of lead and I said, 'Hey, wait a minute, I must be hypnotized?\"' \"You see, you got a conscious realization of the trance state. \" 2. \"Kind of surprised yourself?\" \"No. \" \"Tell me about it.\" \"Well, I read in a book about how the arm came up and sure enough my arm came up, just as I figured it would.\" 3. \"Kind of surprised yourself didn't you?\" \"No.\" \"Tell me about it.\" \"Well, I thought if I were hypnotized I would not hear anything and I would feel like a zombie.\" Then ask, \"What did you experience?\" \"Oh, I just felt the relaxation and my arm coming up and my eyes sort of stuck but I heard a horn blow as a car went by outside.\" What you have done is to take them from the place of basic misunderstanding to a position of some understanding, and what you are doing is to send them home with one of two positions. The first is, \"Yes, I was hypnotized\" or \"I might have been, or, I'm just not quite sure.\""},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"When they get home, the \"significant other\" says to them, \"How did your session with the hypnotist go?\" They can say, \"Oh great, I was hypnotized.\" \"Tell me all about it.\" \"Well, I lay there and had the funniest feeling, my arm rose up -. \" \"Oh great, made another appointment didn't you?\" \"Yeah, next week.\" Or they can say, \"I don't know if I was hypnotized or not.\" \"What do you mean you don't know, what happened?\" \"I got feeling pretty relaxed, and he said your arm is going to come up and my arm came up. It was lifting, I don't know if I was doing it, or what was happening and then he said try to open your eyes, and they did not open.\" They have something to describe to the other interested person. The other party will say, \"You were hypnotized. I can tell you right now you were hypnotized.\" If you have not been doing that and you now begin to do so, it will add up to ten thousand dollars a year to your income because your clients will return for that second session. They will go home with the imagination excited and they will tell everyone, \"I was hypnotized,\" and they will be back for more. Now, what about your fears of being seen as an incompetent? Do you think, \"If they do pop their eyelids open, or don't lift their arm, will they say, 'He is a poor hypnotist'?\" If you are not getting good results with these tests, you should examine the phrasing or methodology that you are using. Perhaps you can talk to some other hypnotherapists who are getting better results. Check your technique against theirs. The wording is so important that in my courses I place great emphasis on it. Every technique is given in full printed form, not just, \"This is what you say,\" but instructions to the hypnotist about what they do and say, a discussion about it and then actual practice of it in workshops, using the scripts. I have spent 35 years testing and perfecting the effectiveness of these scripts. I know that they work and they work every time. I want you to build a series of successful experiences while you are here because that is what you came to me for. To learn how to be an effective hypnotist and you can be most effective when you are generating a good income. Let's suppose you say, \"Your eyelids are locked so tightly that the more you try to open them, the more tightly they are locking closed - now try to open them and find them locking tighter and tighter\" and they open their eyes and smile at you! Show no concern and say, \"That's fine, close them down.\" No matter what a subject does, except to become violent, you always say, \"That's fine.\" If they have a need to disappoint you, or work against you but you continually say \"that's fine\" to all of their responses, they soon learn that they cannot disappoint you by not doing what you suggest. Soon, they will give up; if everything is always \"just fine,\" they will stop resisting. When the session is over, they may say, \"Well I did open my eyes.\""},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Your reply is, \"That's right, please close your eyes, and open them again,\" and they will open them. Ask, \"Is that the way you opened them a moment ago?\" \"No, but I opened them.\" \"Yes, but it took you several seconds. The difference between the way you opened your eyes just now and the way you opened your eyes a moment ago, was the degree of hypnotic suggestion that you had accepted at that moment. Do you understand that clearly?\" Students, it is always the subject who is confused or misinformed - it is impossible for you to fail because you have a great body of knowledge and skills, which you apply creatively. When the subjects response is not as I would like it to be it is their failure to respond appropriately. If their arm did not lift or their eyes did not lock and their left arm did not get heavy. I just say: \"I think we need to talk a moment about your unwillingness to respond. Just close your eyes and think about it now and see if you can come up with a few reasons why you are exhibiting this unwillingness.\" I never use the word resistance, that is a very poor word. if I tell them that they are capable of generating resistance, it is liable to generate more resistance so I tell them it is their unwillingness to respond. #7 GETTING PAID FOR YOUR SERVICES Collecting your fees can be a great problem because there are several models for payment. If you are in an institutional setting or clinic, billing is based on the old models of the physician and psychologist, and the client is billed monthly. No matter how few statements you have to send out it costs time and money. If you want to send out forty or fifty statements, you must invest in the forms, the ledger cards and the clerical labor to address them. All of these services add to your costs. My question is, do you have clients who don't keep an appointment? How many weeks did you have 24 appointments booked on Monday morning and you said, \"I am going to have some income this week,\" but at the end of the week twelve of the twenty four had not shown up. I have been in the work for thirty years, and completed 40,000 hours of clinical hypnotherapy. I was always resentful when I looked at the end of the week and I had \"no shows\" before I adopted the principle I am about to explain to you. Printed on your appointment card is the statement \"Advance notice of a cancellation must be given at least 48 hours in advance or a charge will be made.\" An hour before, or 10 minutes after the appointment time, the client calls and says, \"I'm sorry I can't make it.\" About seventy per cent of them say, \"My car is broken down,\" or \"There has been an accident on the freeway.\" The other thirty per cent say, \"My child is sick and I have to take her to the doctor.\" Or \"My husband took the car and he was supposed to be back but he is not back yet.\" Rarely do they tell you the real reason, such as, \"I had an unexpected expense last week, I had to buy Jimmy football shoes, and they are $68.00, so I thought and thought how could I cut back on expenditures this week and save $50.00.\""},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"They say. \"My car is broken down\". The first reality of this practice is, of those who do it to you once, seventy-five per cent will do it to you twice and of those who do it to you twice, ninety-nine per cent will do it to you three times because that is their pattern of behavior. The same principal applies when you send statements, you get down to a few who are always two to three months behind and your office manager says, \"I thought you ought to see these three overdue accounts.\" You look at them and say, \"Mary Jones owes me for three months! What is wrong with that woman? I knock myself out doing age regressions and twice I let her appointments run over time. Why is she so ungrateful that she is not paying me?\" Question: When Mary Jones walks in for her appointment and you are aware of her unpaid fees, do you have the quality of caring to do your best work with her? What you really feel like doing is to say, \"I work hard for you and give you the best service, but you don't pay me the money and you don't even try to explain why.\" Instead you say, \"That is not professional, so I won't do that. \" The very same thing applies with the no shows. After a client has missed two appointments, unless you are booked months ahead, it is unlikely you will charge them the cancellation fee. You will say, \"This was the first time so I will let it go.\" The second time you say, \"It is not really fair to charge money for something they did not get, besides I could use that time to work on my books.\" But when they walk in the office, you are going to have a resentful feeling that will interfere with the maximum effectiveness of your therapy. I am suggesting there are many, many reasons that you alter your methods for collecting money, and one way to do that is by selling a block of time."}]
