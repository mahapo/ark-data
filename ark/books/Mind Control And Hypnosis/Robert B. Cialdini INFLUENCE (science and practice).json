"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Preface The initial version of Influence was designed for the popular reader, and as such, an attempt was made to write it in an engaging st yle. In the subsequent versions, that style is retained, but in addition, I present the research evidence for my statements, recommendations, and conclusions. Although they are dramatized and corroborated through such devices as interviews, quotes, and systematic personal observations, the conclusions of Influence are based on controlled, psychol ogical research. This fact allows the instructor, the stud ent, and the popular reader to feel confident that the book is not \"pop\" psychology but represents wo rk that is scientifically grounded. The subsequent versions also pr ovide new and updated materi al, chapter summaries, and study questions to enhance its classroom utility. A potentially attractive featur e of the present version of Influence lies in its ability to serve as an enjoyable, practic al, yet scientifically documented text for both students and the general reader. For students, one way to view the book, then, is to see it as a refreshing change of pace (from standard te xt material) that does not retreat from scientific respectability. In a related vein, for both students and the general reader, the book might be seen as a way to demonstrate that, properly presented, what often seems like dry science can actually prove to be liv ely, useful, and relevant to all readers' personal lives. COMMENT ON THE FOURTH EDITION OF INFLUENCE: SCIENCE AND PRACTICE _________________ It has been some time since Influence was last published. In the interim, some things have happened that deserve a place in this new edition. First, we now know more about the influence process than before. The study of persuasion, compliance, and change has advanced, and the pages that follow have be en adapted to reflect that progress. In addition to an overall update of the mate rial, I have expanded a feature that was stimulated by the respon ses of prior readers. This feature highlights the experien ces of individuals who have read Influence, recognized how one of the principles worked on (or for) them in a particular instance, and wrote to me describing the event. Their descriptions, which appe ar in the \"Reader's Reports\" in each chapter, illustrate how easily and frequently we can fall victim to the influence process in our everyday lives. An array of people deserve and have my appreciation for their aid in making Influence possible. Several of my academic colleague s read and provided perceptive comments on the entire manuscript in its initial draft form, greatly strengthening the subsequent version. They are Gus Levine, Doug Kenr ick, Art Beaman, and Mark Zanna. In addition, the first draft was read by a few family members and friends.

For as long as I can recall, I've been an easy mark for the pitches of peddlers, fund-raisers, and operators of one sort or another. True, only some of these people have had dishonorable motives. The others— representatives of certain charitable agen cies, for instance—have had the best of intentions. No matter. With personally di squieting frequency, I have always found myself in possession of unwanted magazine subscriptions or tick ets to the sanitation workers' ball. Probably this long-standing stat us as sucker accounts for my interest in the study of compliance: Just what are the fa ctors that cause one person to say yes to another person? And which techniques most e ffectively use these factors to bring about such compliance? I have wondered why it is th at a request stated in a certain way will be rejected, but a request that asks for the same favor in a slightly different fashion will be successful. So in my role as an experimental soci al psychologist, I began to research the psychology of compliance. At first the re search took the fo rm of experiments performed, for the most part, in my laborator y and on college students. I wanted to find out which psychological principles influenced the tendency to comply with a request. Right now, psychologists know quite a bit a bout these principles—what they are and how they work. I have characterized such prin ciples as weapons of influence and will be discussing some of the most important of them in this book. After a time, though, I began to realize that the experimental work, while necessary, wasn't enough. It didn't allow me to judge th e importance of the principles in the world beyond the psychology building and the cam pus where I was examining them. It became clear that if I was to understand fu lly the psychology of compliance, I would need to broaden my scope of investigati on. I would need to lo ok to the compliance professionals—the people who had been usi ng the principles on me all my life. They know what works and what doesn't; the law of survival of the fitt est assures it. Their business is to make us comply, and their livelihoods depend on it. Those who don't know how to get people to say yes soon fall away; those who do, stay and flourish. Of course, the compliance professionals ar en't the only ones who know about and use these principles to help them get their way. We all employ them and fall victim to them to some degree in our daily interactions w ith neighbors, friends, l overs, and family. But the compliance practitioners have much more than the vague and amateurish understanding of what works than the rest of us have. As I thought about it, I knew that they represented the richest vein of inform ation about compliance available to me. For nearly three years, then, I combined my e xperimental studies with a decidedly more entertaining program: I systematically immersed myself in the world of compliance professionals—salespeople, fund-rais ers, advertisers, and others. My purpose was to observe, from the insi de, the techniques and strategies most commonly and effectively used by a broad range of compliance practitioners. That "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"program of observation sometimes took the form of interviews with the practitioners themselves and sometimes w ith the natural enemies (for example, police bunco-squad officers, consumer agencies) of certain of the practitioners. At ot her times, it involved an intensive examination of the written materials by which compliance techniques are passed down from one generation to a nother—sales manuals and the like. Most frequently, though, it took the form of participant observation. Participant observation is a research approach in which th e researcher becomes a spy of sorts. With disguised identity and intent, the investigat or infiltrates the setting of interest and becomes a full-fledged participant in the group to be studied. So when I wanted to learn about the compliance tactics of encycl opedia (or vacuum cleaner, or portrait photography, or dance lesson) sales organizations, I would answer a newspaper ad for sales trainees and have them teach me their methods. Using similar but not identical approaches, I was able to penetrate adve rtising, public relations, and fund-raising agencies to examine their techniques. Much of the evidence presented in this book, then, comes from my experience posing as a compliance professional, or aspiring professional, in a large variety of organiza tions dedicated to getting us to say yes. One aspect of what I learned in this three-year period of participant observation was most instructive. Although th ere are thousands of differe nt tactics that compliance practitioners employ to produce yes, the majori ty fall within six basic categories. Each of these categories is governed by a fundame ntal psychological pr inciple that directs human behavior and, in so doi ng, gives the tactics their pow er. This book is organized around these six principles. The principles—r eciprocation, consis tency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity—are each disc ussed in terms of their function in the society and in terms of how their enormous force can be commissioned by a compliance professional who deftly incorporates them into requests for purchases, donations, concessions, votes, or assent. 1 Finally, each principle is examined as to its ability to produce a distinct kind of automatic, mindless compliance from people, th at is, a willingness to say yes without thinking first. The evidence suggests that the ever-accelerating pace and informational crush of modern life will make this part icular form of unthinking compliance more and more prevalent in the future. It will be incr easingly important for th e society, therefore, to understand the how and why of automatic influence. 'it is worth noting that I have not included am ong the six principles the simple rule of material self-interest: that people want to get the most and pay the least for their choices. This omission does not stem from any perception on my part that the desire to maximize benefits and minimize costs is unim portant in driving our decisions. Nor does it come from any evidence that I have that compliance professionals ignore the power of this rule. Quite the opposite: in my investigations, I frequently saw practitioners use (sometimes honestly, sometimes not) th e compelling \"I can give you a good deal\" approach. I chose not to treat the material self-interest rule separately in this hook because I see it as a motiva tional given, as a goes-without-saying factor that deserves acknowledgment, but not extensive description.

She was giddy with a curi ous piece of news. Something fascinating had just happened, and she thought that, as a psychologist, I might be able to explain it to her. The story involved a certain allotment of turquoise jewelry she had been having trouble selling. It was the peak of the tour ist season, the store wa s unusually full of customers, the turquoise pieces were of good quality for the prices she was asking; yet they had not sold. My friend had attempted a c ouple of standard sales tricks to get them moving. She tried calling attention to them by shifting their location to a more central display area; no luck. She even told her sa les staff to \"push\" the items hard—again without success. Finally, the night before leaving on an out-of-town buying trip, she scribbled an exasperated note to her head sa leswoman, \"Everything in this display case, price x Vi,\" hoping just to be rid of the o ffending pieces, even if at a loss. When she returned a few days later, she was not surprised to find that every article had been sold. She was shocked, though, to discover that, because the employee had read the \"W in her scrawled message as a \"2,\" the entire allotm ent had sold at twice the original price! That's when she called me. I thought I knew wh at had happened but told her that, if I were to explain things properl y, she would have to listen to a story of mine. Actually, it isn't my story; it's about mother turkeys, a nd it belongs to the rela tively new science of ethology—the study of animals in their natu ral settings. Turkey mothers are good mothers—loving, watchful, and protective. They spend much of their time tending, warming, cleaning, and huddling their young ben eath them; but there is something odd about their method. Virtually all of this moth ering is triggered by one thing: the \"cheep- cheep\" sound of young turkey chicks. Other iden tifying features of th e chicks, such as their smell, touch, or appearance, seem to play minor roles in the mothering process. If a chick makes the cheep-cheep noise, its mother will care for it; if not, the mother will ignore or sometimes kill it. The extreme reliance of maternal turkey s upon this one sound was dramatically illustrated by animal behaviorist M. W. Fox (1 974) in his description of an experiment involving a mother turkey and a stuffed pol ecat. For a mother turkey, a polecat is a natural enemy whose approach is to be gr eeted with squawking, pecking, clawing rage. Indeed, the experiments found that even a st uffed model of a polecat, when drawn by a string to a mother turkey, received an immediate and furious attack. When, however, the same stuffed replica carried inside it a small recorder that played the cheep-cheep sound of baby turkeys, the mother not only accepted the oncoming "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Weapons of Influence 3 polecat but gathered it undernea th her. When the machine was turned off, the polecat model again drew a vicious attack. CLICK, WHIRR How ridiculous a mother turkey seems under these circumstances: She will embrace a natural enemy just because it goes cheep-cheep and she will mistreat or murder one of her chicks just because it doe s not. She acts like an automaton whose maternal instincts are under the automatic control of that single sound. The ethol-ogists tell us that this sort of thing is far from unique to the tu rkey. They have begun to identify regular, blindly mechanical patterns of actio n in a wide variety of species. Called fixed-action patterns, they can involve intricate sequ ences of behavior, such as entire courtship or mating ritu als. A fundamental characteristi c of these patterns is that the behaviors comprising them occur in virtua lly the same fashion and in the same order every time. It is almost as if the patterns were recorded on tapes within the animals. When a situation calls for courtship, a courts hip tape gets played; when a situation calls for mothering, a maternal behavior tape gets played. Click and the appropriate tape is activated; whirr and out rolls the standard sequence of behaviors. The most interesting aspect of all this is the way the tapes are activated. When an animal acts to defend its territory for instance, it is the intrusion of another animal of the same species that cues the territorial-defense tape of rigid vigilance, threat, and if need be, combat behaviors; however, there is a qui rk in the system. It is not the rival as a whole that is the trigger; it is, rather, some specific feature, the trigger feature. Often the trigger feature will be just one tiny aspect of the totality that is th e approaching intruder. Sometimes a shade of color is the trigger f eature. The experiments of ethologists have shown, for instance, that a male robin, acting as if a rival robin had entered its territory, will vigorously attack nothing more than a clump of robin red breast feathers placed there. At the same time, it wi ll virtually ignore a perfect stu ffed replica of a male robin without red breast feathers (Lack, 1943). Similar results have been found in another species of bird, the bluethroat, where it appears that the trigger for territorial defense is a specific shade of blue breas t feathers (Peipo-nen, 1960). Before we enjoy too smugly the ease with wh ich trigger features can trick lower animals into reacting in ways wholly inappropriate to the situation, we shoul d realize two things. First, the automatic, fixed-action patterns of these animals work very well most of the time. For example, because only normal, healt hy turkey chicks make the peculiar sound of baby turkeys, it makes sense for mother turkeys to respond maternally to that single cheep-cheep noise. By reacting to just that one stimulus, the average mother turkey will nearly always behave correctl y. It takes a trickster like a "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"4 Chapter 1 scientist to make her tape like response seem silly. The second important thing to understand is that we, too, ha ve our preprogrammed tapes; and, although they usually work to our advantage, the tr igger features that activate them can dupe us into playing the tapes at the wrong times. 1 This parallel form of human automaticity is aptly demonstrated in an experiment by social psychologist Ellen Langer and her co-workers (Langer, Blank, & Chanowitz, 1978). A well-known principle of human behavior says that when we ask someone to do us a favor we will be more successful if we provide a reason. People simply like to have reasons for what they do. Langer demonstrated this unsurprising fact by asking a small favor of people waiting in line to use a library copying machine: \"Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine becau se I'm in a rush?\" The effectiveness of this request plus-reason was near ly total: 94 percent of those asked let her skip ahead of them in line. Compare this success rate to the results when she made the request only: \"Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine?\" Under those circumstances only 60 percent of those asked complied. At first glance, it appears that the crucial difference between the two reque sts was the additional information provided by the words because I'm in a rush. However, a third type of request tried by Langer showed that this was not the case. It seems th at it was not the whole series of words, but the first one, because, that made the difference. Instead of including a real reason for compliance, Langer's third type of request used the word because and then, adding nothing new, merely restated the obvious: \"Exc use me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make some copies?\" The result was that once again nearly all (93 percen t) agreed, even though no real reason, no new information was added to justify their complia nce. Just as the cheep-cheep sound of turkey chicks triggered an automatic mothering response from mother turkeys, even when it emanated from a stuffed polecat, so the word because triggered an automatic compliance response from Langer's subjects, even when they we re given no subsequent reason to comply. Click, whirr. 2 Although some of Langer's additional findings show that there are many situations in which human behavior does not work in a mechanical, tape-activated way, she is convinced that most of the time it does (Langer, 1989). For instance, consider the strange behavior of those jewelry store customers who swooped down on an allotment of turquoise pieces only af ter the items had been mistak enly offered at double their original price. I can make no sense of their behavior unless it is viewed in click, whirr terms. 'Although several important similarities exis t between this kind of automaticity in humans and lower animals, there are some im portant differences as well. The automatic behavior patterns of humans tend to be lear ned rather than inborn, more flexible than the lock-step patterns of the lower animal s, and responsive to a larger number of triggers. 2 Perhaps the common \"because ... just because\" response of children asked to explain their behavior can be traced to their shrewd recognition of the unusual amount of power adults appear to assign to the word because."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Weapons of Influence 5 "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"6 Chapter 1 The customers, mostly well-to-do vacationers with little knowledge of turquoise, were using a standard principle— a stereotype—to guide thei r buying: expe nsive = good. Much research shows that people who are unsure of an item's quality often use this stereotype (for a review, see Olson, 1977). Thus the vacationers, who wanted \"good\" jewelry, saw the turquoise pieces as deci dedly more valuable and desirable when nothing about them was enhanced but the pr ice. Price alone had become a trigger feature for quality, and a dramatic increase in price alone had led to a dramatic increase in sales among the quality-hungry buyers. 3 READER'S REPORT 1.1 From a Management Doctoral Student A man who owns an antique jewelry store in my town tells a story of how he learned the expensive = good lesson of social influe nce. A friend of his wanted a special birthday present for his fiancee. So, the jewe ler picked out a necklace that would have sold in his store for $500 but that he was willing to let his friend have for $250. As soon as he saw it, the friend was enthusiastic a bout the piece. But when the jeweler quoted the $250 price, the man's face fell, and he bega n backing away from the deal because he wanted something \"really nice\" for his intended bride. When a day later it dawned on the jeweler what had happened, he called his friend and asked him to come back to the store because he had another necklace to show him. This time, he introduced the new piece at its regul ar $500 price. His friend liked it enough to buy it on the spot. But before any money was ex changed, the jeweler told him that, as a wedding gift, he would drop the price to $250. The man was thrilled. Now, rather than finding the $250 sales price offensive, he was overjoyed— and grateful—to have it. Author's note: Notice that, as in the case of the turquoise jewelry buyers, it was someone who wanted to be assured of good merchandise who disdai ned the low-priced item. I'm confident that besides the \"exp ensive = good\" rule, there's a flip side, \"inexpensive = bad\" rule that applies to our thinking as well. After all, in English, the word cheap doesn't just mean inexpensive; it has come to mean inferior, too. BETTING THE SHORTCUT ODDS It is easy to fault the tourists for their f oolish purchase decisions, but a close look offers a kinder view. These were people who had been brought up on the rule, \"You 3 In marketing lore, the classic case of this phenomenon is that of Chivas Regal Scotch Whiskey, which had been a str uggling brand until its managers decided to raise its price to a level far above its competitors. Sales skyrocketed, even though nothing was changed in the product itself (Aaker, 1991). "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Weapons of Influence 7 get what you pay for\" and who had seen that rule borne out over and over in their lives. Before long, they had translated the rule to mean expensive = good. The expensive = good stereotype had worked quite well for them in the past, since no rmally the price of an item increases along with its worth; a hi gher price typically re flects higher quality. So when they found themselves in the pos ition of wanting good tu rquoise jewelry but not having much knowledge of turquoise, they understandably relied on the old standby feature of cost to determine the je welry's merits (Rao & Monroe, 1989). Although they probably did not realize it, by reacting solely to the price of the turquoise, they were playing a shortcut ve rsion of betting the odds. Instead of stacking all the odds in their favor by trying painstak ingly to master each f eature that indicates the worth of turquoise jewelry, they were counting on just one—the one they knew to be usually associated with the quality of a ny item. They were bet ting that price alone would tell them all they needed to know. This time, because someone mistook a \"Vz\" for a \"2,\" they bet wrong. In the long run, over all the past and future situations of their lives, betting those shortcut odds may repres ent the most rational approach possible. In fact, automatic, stereotyped behavior is prevalent in much human action, because in many cases, it is the most efficient form of behaving (Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996), and in other cases it is simply necessa ry (Bodenhausen, Macr ae, & Sherman, 1999; Fiske & Neuberg, 1990). You and I exist in an extraordinarily complicated environment, easily the most rapidly moving and complex that has ever existed on this planet. To deal with it, we need shortcuts. We can't be expected to recognize and analyze all the aspects in each person, event, and situation we encounter in even one day. We haven't the time, energy, or capacity fo r it. Instead, we must very often use our stereotypes, our rules of thumb, to classify things according to a few key features and then to respond without thinki ng when one or another of these trigger features is present. Sometimes the behavior that unrolls will not be appropriate for the situation, because not even the best stereotypes and trigger features work ev ery time. We will accept their imperfections since there is really no other choice. Without these features we would stand frozen—cataloging, appraising, and calibrating—as the time for action sped by and away. From all indications, we will be relying on these stereotypes to an even greater extent in the future. As the stimuli saturating our lives cont inue to grow more intricate and variable, we will have to de pend increasingly on our shortcuts to handle them all. 4 4 Take, by way of illustration, the case (Zim matore, 1983) of the automatic, mindless consumer response to a standard trigger for buying in our society—the discount coupon. A tire company found that mailed-out coupons which, because of a printing error, offered no savings to recipients produced ju st as much customer response as did the error-free coupons that offe red substantial savings. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"8 Chapter 1 Psychologists have recently uncovered a number of mental shortcuts that we employ in making our everyday judgments (Chaiken & Trope, 1999; Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982). Termed judgmental heuristics, these shortcuts operate in much the same fashion as the expensive = good rule, allowing for simplified thinking that works well most of the time but leaves us open to occasional, costly mistakes. Especially relevant to this book are those heuristics that tell us when to believe or do what we are told. Consider, for example, the shortcut rule that goes, \"If an expert said so, it must be true.\" As we will see in Chapter 6, ther e is an unsettling tendenc y in our society to accept unthinkingly the statements and direc tions of individuals who appear to be authorities on the topic. That is, rather than thinking about an expert's arguments and being convinced (or not), we frequently igno re the arguments and allow ourselves to be convinced just by the expert's status as \"expe rt.\" This tendency to respond mechanically to one piece of information in a situation is what we have been calling automatic or click, whirr responding; the tendency to react on the basis of a thorough analysis of all of the information can be referred to as controlled responding (Chaiken & Trope, 1999).

All rights reserve "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Weapons of Influence 9 Quite a lot of laboratory research has shown that people are more likely to deal with information in a controlled fashion when th ey have both the desire and the ability to analyze it carefully; otherwise, they are likely to use the easier click, whirr approach (for reviews, see Chen & Chaiken, 1999; Pe tty & Wegener, 1999). For instance, in one study (Petty, Cacioppo, & Goldman, 1981), stude nts at the University of Missouri listened to a recorded speech that supported the idea of requiring all seniors to pass comprehensive examinations before they would be allowed to graduate. The issue affected some of them personally, because they were told that the exams could go into effect in the next year—before they had th e chance to graduate. Of course, this news made them want to analyze the arguments car efully. However, for other subjects in the study, the issue had little personal importance —because they were told that the exams would not begin until long afte r they had graduated; cons equently, they had no strong need to carefully consider the argument 's validity. The study's results were quite straightforward: Those subjects with no pe rsonal stake in the topic were primarily persuaded by the speaker's expertise in the fiel d of education; they used the \"If an expert said so, it must be true\" rule, paying little attention to the strength of the speaker's arguments. Those subjects for whom the i ssue mattered personally, on the other hand, ignored the speaker's expertise and were persuaded primarily by the quality of the speaker's arguments. So, it appears that when it come s to the dangerous business of click, whirr responding, we give ourselves a safety net: We resist the seductive luxury of registering and reacting to just a single (trigger) feat ure of the available information when an issue is important to us. No doubt this is often the case (Leippe & Elkin, 1987). Yet, I am not fully comforted. Recall that earlier we learned that people are like ly to respond in a controlled, thoughtful fashion only when they have both the desire and the ability to do so. I have recently become impressed by evidence suggesting that the form and pace of modern life is not allowing us to make fully thoughtful decisions, even on many personally relevant topics (Cohen, 1978; Milgram, 1970). That is, sometimes the issues may be so complicated, the time so tight, the distractions so intrusive, the emotional arousal so strong, or the mental fatigue so d eep that we are in no cognitive condition to operate mindfully. Important topic or not, we have to take the shortcut. 5 Perhaps nowhere is this last point driven home more dramatically than in the life-and- death consequences of a phenomenon that ai rline industry officials have labeled Captainitis (Foushee, 1984). Accident investigators from the Federal Aviation 5 It's instructive that even though we often don't take a complex approach to personally important topics, we wish our advisors—our physicians, accountants, lawyers, and brokers—to do precisely that for us (Kahn & Baron, 1995). When feeling overwhelmed by a complicated and consequential choice, we still want a fully considered, point-by- point analysis of it—an analysis we may not be able to achieve except, ironically enough, through a shortcut: reliance on an expert. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"10 Chapter 1 Administration have noted that, frequently, an obvious error made by a flight captain was not corrected by the other crew members and resulted in a crash. It seems that, despite the clear and strong pe rsonal importance of the issu es, the crew members were using the shortcut \"If an expert says so, it must be true\" ru le in failing to attend or respond to the captain's disastrous mi stake (Harper, Kidera, & Cullen, 1971). An account by John Watson, Jr., the former chai rman of IBM, offers graphic evidence of the phenomenon. During World War II, he wa s assigned to investigate plane crashes in which high-ranking officers were killed or injured. One case involved a famous air. force general named Uzal Ent whose copilot got sick before a fli ght. Ent was assigned a replacement who felt honored to be flying alongside the legendary general. During takeoff, Ent began singing to himself, noddi ng in time to a song in his head. The new copilot interpreted the gesture as a signal to him to lift the wheels. Even though they were going much too slowly to fly, he raised the landing gear, causing the plane to drop immediately onto its belly. In the wreck, a propeller blade sliced into Ent's back, severing his spine and rendering him a paraplegic. Watson (1990) described the copilot's explanation for his action: When I took the copilot's testimony, I asked hi m, \"If you knew the pl ane wasn 't going to fly, why did you put the gear up ? \" He said, \"I thought the general wanted me to.\" He was stupid, (p. 117) Stupid? In that singular set of circumstan ces, yes. Understandable? In the shortcut- demanding maze of modern life, also yes. THE PROFITEERS It is odd that despite their current widespr ead use and looming future importance, most of us know very little about our automatic behavior patterns. Perhaps that is so precisely because of the mechanistic, unthinking manne r in which they occur. Whatever the reason, it is vital that we clea rly recognize one of their proper ties. They make us terribly vulnerable to anyone who does know how they work. To understand fully the nature of our vulnerability, let us take another glance at the work of the ethologists. It turns out that th ese animal behaviorists with their recorded cheep-cheeps and their clumps of colored breast feathers are not the only ones who have discovered how to activate the behavior tapes of various species. One group of organisms, often termed mimics, copy the trigger features of other animals in an attempt to trick these animals into mistakenly play ing the right behavior tapes at the wrong times. The mimics then exploit this altogether inappropriate action fo r their own benefit. Take, for example, the deadly trick played by the killer females of one genus of firefly (Photuris) on the males of another firefly genus (Photinus). Understandably, the Photinus males scrupulously avoid cont act with the bloodthirsty Photuris fe- "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Weapons of Influence 11 males. However, through centuri es of natural selection, the Photuris female hunters have located a weakness in their prey—a special blinki ng courtship code by which members of the victims' species tell one a nother they are ready to mate. By mimicking the flashing mating signals of her prey, the mu rderess is able to feast on the bodies of males whose triggered courtship tapes cause th em to fly mechanically into death's, not love's, embrace (Lloyd, 1965). 6 In the struggle for survival, nearly every form of life has its mimics—right down to some of the most primitive pathogens. By a dopting certain critical features of useful hormones or nutrients, these clever bacteria and viruses can gain entry into a healthy host cell. The result is that the healthy cell eagerly and naively sw eeps into itself the causes of such diseases as rabies, mononucleosis, and the common cold (Goodenough, 1991). 7 It should come as no surprise, then, that there is a strong but sad parallel in the human jungle. We too have pr ofiteers who mimic trigger feat ures for our own brand of automatic responding. Unlike the mostly ins tinctive response sequences of nonhumans, however, our automatic tapes usually deve lop from psychological principles or stereotypes we have learned to accept. Although they vary in their force, some of these principles possess a tremendous ability to dire ct human action. We have been subjected to them from such an early point in our lives, and they have moved us about so pervasively since then, that you and I rarely perceive their po wer. In the eyes of others, though, each such principle is a detectable and ready weap on, a weapon of automatic influence. There are some people who know very well where the weapons of automatic influence lie and who employ them regularly and exper tly to get what they want. They go from social encounter to social encounter, requesti ng others to comply with their wishes; their frequency of success is dazzling. The secret of their effectiveness lies in the way that they structure their requests, the way that they arm themselves with one or another of the weapons of influence that exist is the social environmen t. To do this may take no more than one correctly chosen word that engages a strong psyc hological principle and sets rolling one of our automa tic behavior tapes. Trust the Apparently, the tendency of males to be bamboozled by powerful mating signals extends to humans. Two University of Vie nna biologists, Astrid Juette and Karl Grammer secretly exposed young men to air borne chemicals (called copulins) that mimic human vaginal scents. The men then rated the attractiveness of women's faces. Exposure to the copulins increased the j udged attractiveness of all the women and masked the genuine physical attractiven ess differences among them (\"For Women,\" 1999). 7 As exploitative as these crea tures seem, they are topped in this respect by an insect known as the rove beetle. By using a variety of triggers involving smell and touch, the rove beetles get two species of ants to pr otect, groom, and feed them as larvae and to harbor them for the winter as adults. Res ponding mechanically to the beetles' trick trigger features, the ants trea t the beetles as thoug h they were fellow ants. Inside the ant nests, the beetles respond to their hosts' hospitality by eating ant eggs and young; yet they are never harmed (Holldobler, 1971)."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"12 Chapter 1 human profiteers to learn quickly exactly how to benefit from our tendency to respond mechanically according to these principles. Remember my friend the jewelry store ow ner? Although she benefited by accident the first time, it did not take her long to be gin exploiting the expe nsive = good stereotype regularly and intentionally. Now during the to urist season, she first tries to speed the sale of an item that has been difficult to move by increasing its price substantially. She claims that this is marvelously cost-e ffective. When it works on the unsuspecting vacationers—as it frequently does—it resu lts in an enormous profit margin. And even when it is not initially successful , she can then mark the article \"Reduced\" and sell it to bargain-hunters at its original price while still taking advantage of their expensive = good reaction to the inflated figure. By no means is my friend origin al in this last use of the expensive = good rule to snare those seeking a bargain. Culturist and auth or Leo Rosten gives the example of the Drubeck brothers, Sid and Harry, who owned a men's tailor shop in Rosten's neighborhood in the 1930s. Whenever Sid had a new customer trying on suits in front of the shop's three-sided mirror, he would ad mit to a hearing probl em and repeatedly request that the man speak more loudly to him. Once the customer had found a suit he liked and asked for the price, Sid would call to his brother, the head tailor, at the back of the room, \"Harry, how much for this su it?\" Looking up from his work— and greatly exaggerating the suit's true price—Harry would ca ll back, \"For that beautiful, all wool suit, forty-two dollars.\" Pretending not to have heard and cupping his hand to his ear, Sid would ask again. Once more Harry would re ply, \"Forty-two dollars.\" At this point, Sid would turn to the customer and report, \"He says twenty-two dollars.\" Many a man would hurry to buy th e suit and scramble out of the shop with his expensive = good bargain before poor Sid discovered the \"mistake.\" JUJITSU A woman employing the Japanese martial ar t form called jujitsu would use her own strength only minimally against an opponent . Instead, she would exploit the power inherent in such naturally present princi ples as gravity, leverage, momentum, and inertia. If she knows how and where to engage the action of these principles she can easily defeat a physically stronger rival. And so it is for the exploiters of the weapons of automatic influence that exist naturally around us. The profiteers can commission the power of these weapons for use against their targets while exerting l ittle personal force. This last feature of the process gives the pr ofiteers an enormous additional benefit— the ability to manipulate without the appear ance of manipulation. Even the victims themselves tend to see their compliance as a re sult of the action of natural forces rather than the designs of the person who profits from that compliance. An example is in order. There is a principl e in human perception, th e contrast principle, that affects the way we see the differe nce between two things that are pre- "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Weapons of Influence 13 sented one after another. Simply put, if the second item is fairly different from the first, we will tend to see it as more different than it actually is. So if we lift a light object first and then lift a heavy object, we will estimate the second object to be heavier than if we had lifted it without first lifting the light one . The contrast principle is well established in the field of psychophysics and applies to all sorts of perceptions besi des weight. If we are talking to a very attractive individual at a party and are then joined by an unattractive individual, the second will strike us as less attr active than he or she actually is. 8 Another demonstration of pe rceptual contrast is some times employed in psychophysics laboratories to introduce students to the princi ple. Each student takes a turn sitting in front of three pails of water—one cold, one at room temperature, and one hot. After placing one hand in the cold wate r and one in the hot water, the student is told to place both hands in the room-temperature wa ter simultaneously. The look of amused bewilderment that immediatel y registers tells the story: Even though both hands are in the same bucket, the hand that has been in th e cold water feels as if it is now in hot water, while the one that was in the hot wate r feels as if it is now in cold water. The point is that the same thing—in this instan ce, room-temperature water—can be made to seem very different depending on the na ture of the event that precedes it. Be assured that the nice lit tle weapon of influence provide d by the contrast principle does not go unexploited. The great advantage of this principl e is not only that it works but also that it is virtually undetectab le. Those who employ it can cash in on its influence without any appearance of having stru ctured the situation in their favor. Retail clothiers are a good example. Suppose a man en ters a fashionable men's store and says that he wants to buy a three-piece suit and a sweater. If you were the salesperson, which would you show him first to make him likely to spend the most m oney? Clothing stores instruct their sales pe rsonnel to sell the co stly item first. Common sense might suggest the reverse: If a man has just spent a lo t of money to purchase a suit, he may be reluctant to spend much more on the purchas e of a sweater; but the clothiers know better. They behave in accordance with what the cont rast principle would suggest: Sell the suit first, because when it comes time to look at sweaters, even expensive ones, their prices will not seem as high in comparison. The same principle applies to a man who wishes to buy the accessories (shirt, shoes, belt) to go along with his new suit. Contrary to the commonsense view, the evidence supp orts the contrast principle prediction. According to sales motivation analysts 8 Some researchers warn that the unrealistically attractive people portrayed in the popular media (actors, actresses, models) may cause us to be less satisfied with the looks of the genuinely avai lable romantic possibilities around us. For instance, one study demonstrated that exposure to the exa ggerated sexual attracti veness of nude pinup bodies (in such magazines as Playboy and Play girl) causes people to become less pleased with the sexual desira bility of their cu rrent spouse or live-in mate (Kenrick, Gutierres, & Goldberg, 1989). "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"14 Chapter 1 Whitney, Hubin, and Murphy (1965), \"The inte resting thing is that even when a man enters a clothing store with the express pur pose of purchasing a suit, he will almost always pay more for whatever accessories he buys if he buys them after the suit purchase than before.\" It is much more profitable for salespeople to present the expensive item first; to fail to do so will lose the influence of the contrast pr inciple and will also cause the principle to work actively against them. Presenting an inexpensive product first and following it with an expensive one will make the expe nsive item seem even more costly as a result—hardly a desirable consequence for most sales organizations. So, just as it is possible to make the same bucket of water a ppear to be hotter or colder depending on the temperature of previously presented wate r, it is possible to make the price of the same item seem higher or lower depending on th e price of a previously presented item. Clever use of perceptual contrast is by no means confined to clothiers. (See Figure 1.1.) I came across a technique that engaged the contrast principle while I was investigating, undercover, the compliance tactics of real es tate companies. To \"learn the ropes,\" I accompanied a salesman on a weekend of s howing houses to prospective home buyers. The salesman—we can call him Phil—was to give me tips to help me through my break-in period. One thing I quickly noticed was that whenever Phil began showing a new set of customers potential buys, he woul d start with a couple of undesirable houses. I asked him about it, and he laughed. They we re what he called \"setup\" properties. The company maintained a run-down house or tw o on its lists at inflated prices. These houses were not intended to be sold to cust omers but only to be shown to them, so that the genuine properties in the company's inve ntory would benefit from the comparison. Not all the sales staff made use of the setu p houses, but Phil did. He said he liked to watch his prospects' \"eyes light up\" when "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Weapons of Influence 15 "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"16 Chapter 1 he showed the places he rea lly wanted to sell them after they had seen the rundown houses. \"The house I got them spotted for looks really great after th ey've first looked at a couple of dumps.\" Automobile dealers use the contrast principl e by waiting until the price of a car has been negotiated before suggesting one option after another. In the wake of a many-thousand- dollar deal, the hundred or so dollars extra for a nicety like a CD player seems almost trivial in comparison. The same will be true of the added expense of accessories like tinted windows, dual side-view mirrors, better tire s, or special trim that the dealer might suggest in sequence. The trick is to bring up the options inde pendently of one another so that each small price will seem petty when compared to the already determined much larger price. As veteran car buyers can atte st, many a budget-sized final price figure has ballooned out of proportion from the additi on of all those seem ingly little options. While the customers stand, signed contra ct in hand, wondering what happened and finding no one to blame but themselves, the car dealer stands smiling the knowing smile of the jujitsu master. READER'S REPORT 1.2 From a University of Chic ago Business School Student While waiting to board a flight at O'Hare, I heard a desk agent a nnounce that the flight was overbooked and that, if passengers were wil ling to take a later plane, they would be compensated with a voucher worth $10,000! Of course, this exaggerated amount was a joke. It was supposed to make people laugh. It did. But I noticed th at when he then revealed the actual offer (a $200 voucher), there were no takers. In fact, he had to raise the offer twice, to $300 and then $500, before he got any volunteers . I was reading your book at the time, and I realized that, although he got his laugh, according to the contrast principle he screwed up. He'd arranged things so that compared to $10,000, a couple hundred bucks seemed like a pittance. That was an expensive laugh. It cost his airline an extra $300 per volunteer. Author's note: Any ideas on how the desk age nt could have used th e contrast principle to his advantage rather than his detriment? Perhaps he could have started with a $5 joke offer and then revealed the true (and now much more attractive-sounding) $200 amount. Under those circumstances, I'm pretty sure he would have secured his laugh and his volunteers. SUMMARY Ethologists, researchers who study animal beha vior in the natural environment, have noticed that among many animal species behavior often occurs in rigid and "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Weapons of Influence 17 mechanical patterns. Called fixed-action patterns, these mechanical behavior sequences are noteworthy in their similarity to certain automatic (click, whirr) responding by humans. For both humans a nd subhumans, the automatic behavior patterns tend to be triggered by a single f eature of the relevant information in the situation. This single feature, or trigger feature, can often prove very valuable by allowing an individual to deci de on a correct course of act ion without having to analyze carefully and completely each of the othe r pieces of information in the situation. • The advantage of such shortcut respondi ng lies in its efficiency and economy; by reacting automatically to a usually informativ e trigger feature, an individual preserves crucial time, energy, and mental capacity. Th e disadvantage of such responding lies in its vulnerability to silly and co stly mistakes; by reacting to only a piece of the available information (even a normally predictive piece), an individual increases the chances of error, especially when responding in an automatic, mindless fashion. The chances of error increase even further when other indi viduals seek to prof it by arranging (through manipulation of trigger features ) to stimulate a desired behavi or at inappropriate times. • Much of the compliance process (wherein one person is spurred to comply with another person's request) can be underst ood in terms of a human tendency for automatic, shortcut responding. Most individuals in our culture have developed a set of trigger features for compliance, that is, a set of specific pieces of information that normally tell us when compliance with a reque st is likely to be co rrect and beneficial. Each of these trigger features for complian ce can be used like a weapon (of influence) to stimulate people to agree to requests.

He sent Christmas cards to a sample of perf ect strangers. Although he e xpected some reaction, the response he received was amazing—holiday car ds addressed to him came pouring back from people who had never met nor heard of him. The great majority of those who returned cards never inquired into the identity of the unknow n professor. They received his holiday greeting card, click, and whirr, they automatically sent cards in return (Kunz & Woolcott, 1976). While small in scope, this study shows the action of one of the most potent of the weapons of influence around us—the rule of re ciprocation. The rule says that we should try to repay, in kind, what another person ha s provided us. If a woman does us a favor, we should do her one in retu rn; if a man sends us a bi rthday present, we should remember his birthday with a gift of our ow n; if a couple invites us to a party, we should be sure to invite them to one of ours. By virtue of the reciprocity rule, then, we are obligated to the future repayment of favors, gifts, invitations , and the like. So typical is it for indebtedness to accompany the receip t of such things that a phrase like \"much obliged\" has become a synonym for \"thank you, \" not only in the English language but in others as well. The impressive aspect of reciprocation with its accompanying sense of obligation is its pervasiveness in human culture. It is so widespread that, afte r intensive study, Alvin Gouldner (1960), along with other sociologists, report that all human societies subscribe to the rule. 1 Within each society it seems pervas ive also; it permeates exchanges of every kind. Indeed, it may we ll be that a developed syst em of indebtedness flowing from the rule of reciprocation is a uni que property of human culture. The noted archaeologist Richard Leakey ascribes the essence of what makes us human to the reciprocity system. He claims that we are human because our ancestors learned to share food and skills \"in an honored network of obligation\" (Leakey & Lewin, 1978). Cultural anthropologists view this \"w eb of indebtedness\" as a unique adaptive mechanism of human beings, allowing for the division of labor, the exchange of diverse forms of goods and different servi ces, and the creation of Certain societies have formalized the rule in to ritual. Consider for example the Vartan Bhanji, an institutionalized custom of gift exchange common to parts of Pakistan and India. In commenting upon the Vartan Bhanji, Gouldner (1960) remarks: It is . .. notable that the system painstakingly prevents the total elimination of outstanding obligations. Thus, on the occa sion of a marriage, departing guests are given gifts of sweets. In we ighing them out, the hostess may say, \"These five are yours,\" meaning \"These are a repayment for what you formerly ga ve me,\" and then she adds an extra measure, saying, \"These are mine.\" On the next occasion, she will receive these back along with an additional measure which she later returns, and so on.

It is a sense of future obligation that is critical to produce social advances of the sort described by Tiger and Fox. A widely shar ed and strongly held feeling of future obligation made an enormous difference in hum an social evolution because it meant that one person could give something (for exam ple, food, energy, care) to another with confidence that the gift was not being lost. Fo r the first tune in evolutionary history, one individual could give away any of a variety of resource s without actually giving them away. The result was the lowering of the natural inhibitions against transactions that must be begun by one person's providing personal res ources to another. Sophisticated and coordinated systems of aid, gift givi ng, defense, and trade became possible, bringing immense benefits to the societie s that possessed them. With such clearly adaptive consequences for the culture, it is not surprising that the rule for reciprocation is so deeply implanted in us by the proce ss of socialization we all undergo. I know of no better illustration of the way reciprocal oblig ations can reach long and powerfully into the future than the perplexing story of $5,000 of relief aid that was exchanged between Mexico and Ethiopia. In 1985, Et hiopia could justly lay clai m to the greatest suffering and privation in the world. Its economy was in ruin. Its food supply had been ravaged by years of drought and internal war. Its in habitants were dying by the thousands from disease and starvation. Under these circumstances, I would not have been surprised to learn of a $5,000 relief donation from Mexico to that wrenchingly needy country. I remember my feeling of amazement, though, when a brief newspaper item I was reading insisted that the aid had gone in the opposite direction. Native officials of the Ethiopian Red Cross had decided to send the m oney to help the victims of that year's earthquakes in Mexico City. It is both a personal bane and a professional blessing that whenever I am confused by some aspect of human behavior, I feel driven to investigate further. In this instance, I was able to track down a fuller account of the story. Fortunately, a journalist who had been as bewildered as I by the Ethiopians' actions ha d asked for an explanation. The answer he received offered eloquent validati on of the reciprocity rule: Despite the enormous needs prevailing in Ethiopia, the m oney was being sent to Mexico because, in 1935, Mexico had sent aid to Ethiopia when it was invaded by It aly (\"Ethiopian Red Cross,\" 1985). So informed, I remained awed, but I was no longer puzzled. The need to reciprocate had transcended gr eat cultural differences, long distances, acute famine, many years, and immediate self-interest. Quite simply, a half-century later, against all countervailing forces, obligation triumphed. HOW THE RULE WORKS Make no mistake, human societies derive a truly significant competitive advantage from the reciprocity rule and, c onsequently, they make sure their members are trained to comply with and believe in it. Each of us has been taught to live up to the rule, "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"22 Chapter 2 and each of us knows the social sanctions a nd derision applied to anyone who violates it. Because there is a general distaste for t hose who take and make no effort to give in return, we will often go to great lengths to avoid being considered a moocher, ingrate, or freeloader. It is to those lengths that we will often be taken and, in the process, be \"taken\" by individuals who stand to gain from our indebtedness. To understand how the rule of reciprocati on can be exploited by one who recognizes it as the weapon of influence it certainly is , we might closely examine an experiment conducted by psychologist Dennis Regan (1971) . A subject who participated in the study rated, along with another subject, the quality of some paintings as part of an experiment on \"art appreciation.\" The othe r rater—we can call him Joe—was only posing as a fellow subject and was actually Dr. Regan's assistant. For our purposes, the experiment took place under two different conditions. In some cases, Joe did a small, unsolicited favor for the true s ubject. During a short rest pe riod, Joe left the room for a couple of minutes and returned with two bo ttles of Coca-Cola, one for the subject and one for himself, saying \"I asked him [the e xperimenter] if I could get myself a Coke, and he said it was OK, so I bought one for you, too.\" In other cases, Joe did not provide the subject with a favor; he simply return ed from the two-minute break empty-handed. In all other respects, howev er, Joe behaved identically. Later on, after the paintings had all been rated and the experimenter had momentarily left the room, Joe asked the subject to do him a favor. He indicated that he was selling raffle tickets for a new car and that if he so ld the most tickets, he would win a $50 prize. Joe's request was for the subject to buy so me raffle tickets at 25 cents apiece: \"Any would help, the more the better.\" The major finding of the study c oncerns the number of tickets subjects purchased from Joe under the two conditions. Without question, Joe was more successful in selling his raffle tickets to the subjects who had received his earlier favor. Apparently feeling that they owed him something, these subjects bought twice as many tickets as the subjects who had not been given the prior favor. Although the Regan study represents a fairly simple demo nstration of the workings of the rule of reciprocation, it illustrates se veral important charac teristics of the rule that, upon further consideration, help us to understa nd how it may be profitably used. The Rule Is Overpowering One of the reasons reciprocat ion can be used so effectiv ely as a device for gaining another's compliance is its power. The rule possesses awesome strength, often producing a yes response to a request that, ex cept for an existing feeling of indebtedness, would have surely been refu sed. Some evidence of how the rule's force can overpower the influence of other factor s that normally determine compliance with a request can be seen in a s econd result of the Regan study. Besides his interest in the impact of the reciprocity rule on complian ce, Regan was also investigating how liking for a person affects the tendency to comply with that person's request. To mea- "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Reciprocation 23 sure how liking toward Joe a ffected the subjects' decisions to buy his raffle tickets, Regan had them fill out several rating scales indicating how much they had liked Joe. He then compared their liking responses with the number of tickets they had purchased from Joe. There was a significant tendency for subjects to buy more raffle tickets from Joe the more they liked him. This alone is hardly a startling finding, since most of us would have guessed that people are more willing to do a favor for someone they like. The interesting finding of the Regan experi ment, however, was that the relationship between liking and compliance was completely wiped out in the condition under which subjects had been given a Coke by Joe. Fo r those who owed him a favor, it made no difference whether they liked him or not; they felt a sense of obligation to repay him, and they did. The subjects who indicated that they disliked Joe bought just as many of his tickets as did those who i ndicated that they liked him. The rule for reciprocity was so strong that it simply overwhelmed th e influence of a factor— liking for the requester—that normally affect s the decision to comply. Think of the implications. People we might ordinarily dislike—uns avory or unwelcome sales operators, disagreeable acquaintances , representatives of strange or unpopular organizations—can greatly increase the chance that we will do what they wish merely by providing us with a small favor prior to th eir requests. Let's take a recent historical example. The Hare Krishna Society is an East ern religious sect with centuries-old roots traceable to the Indian city of Calcutta. Its spectacular modern-day story occurred in the 1970s when it experienced a remarkable grow th, not only in followers, but also in wealth and property. The ec onomic growth was funded thro ugh a variety of activities, the principal and most visible of which was society members' requests for donations from passers by in public places. During the early history of the group in this country, the solicitation for contributions was attemp ted in a fashion memorable for anyone who saw it. Groups of Krishna devotees—often with shaved heads, and wearing ill-fitting robes, leg wrappings, beads, and bells— would canvass a city street, chanting and bobbing in unison while begging for funds. Although highly effective as an attention-get ting technique, this practice did not work especially well for fund-raising. The average American considered the Krishnas weird, to say the least, and was reluctant to provi de money to support them. It quickly became clear to the society that it had a considerable public-rela tions problem. The people being asked for contributions did not like the wa y the members looked, dressed, or acted. Had the society been an ordinary commercial organization, the soluti on would have been simple—change the things the public doe s not like. The Krishnas are a religious organization, however, and the way members l ook, dress, and act is partially tied to religious factors. Since religious factors ar e typically resistant to change because of worldly considerations, the Krishna leadership was faced with a r eal dilemma. On the one hand were beliefs, modes of dress, and ha irstyles that had relig ious significance. On the other, and threatening th e organization's financial we lfare, were the less-than- positive feelings of the American public to ward these things. What's a sect to do? "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Reciprocation 24 The Krishnas' resolution was brilliant. They switched to a fund-raising tactic that made it unnecessary for their targets to have posit ive feelings toward the fundraisers. They began to employ a donation-request procedure that engaged the rule for reciprocation, which, as demonstrated by the Regan study, was strong enough to overcome dislike for the requester. The new strategy still involved the so licitation of contribu tions in public places with much pedestrian traffic (airports were a favorite), but, before a donation was requested, the target pers on was given a \"gift\"—a book (usually the Bhagavod Gita), the Back to Godhead magazine of the society, or, in the most cost-effective version, a flower. The unsuspecting passersby who suddenly found flowers pressed into their hands or pinned to their jackets were under no circumstances allowed to give them back, even if they asserted that they did not want them. \"No, it is our gift to you,\" said the solicitor, refusi ng to take it back. Only after the Krishna member had thus brought the force of the reci procation rule to bear on the situation was the target asked to provide a contribution to the society. This bene-factor-before-beggar strategy was wildly successful for the Ha re Krishna Society, producing large-scale economic gains and funding, the ownership of temples, businesses, houses, and property in 321 centers in the United States and abroad."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Reciprocation 25 As an aside, it is instructive that the recipr ocation rule has outlived its usefulness for the Krishnas, not because the rule itself has beco me any less potent societally, but because we have found ways to prevent the Krishna s from using it on us. After once falling victim to their tactic, many travelers becam e alert to the presence of robed Krishna Society solicitors in airports and train st ations, adjusting their paths to avoid an encounter and preparing beforehand to ward off a solicitor's \"gift. \" Although the society tried to counter this increased vigilance by instructing members to be dressed and groomed in modern styles to avoid im mediate recognition when soliciting (some actually carried flight bags or suitcases), ev en disguise did not work especially well for the Krishnas. Too many individuals now know better than to accept unrequested offerings in public places such as airpor ts. In addition, after a flood of complaints, airports began banning the Society's fund -raising efforts from their premises. As a result, the Krishnas experienced a seve re financial reversal. In North America, nearly 30 percent of their temples have been closed for economic reasons, and the number of devotees staffing the remaining temples has plummeted from a high of 5,000 to an estimated 800. The Krishnas are a resi lient group, though. Offici als admit that the organization is struggling to maintain its long-standing presence in North America, but they report that it is thriving in the newl y opened \"markets\" of Eastern Europe—where, apparently, people haven't yet caught on to the Krishnas' strategic benevolence. Although the Krishnas have move d on to \"greener\" pastures, we would be foolish to think that they've taken all the effective reciprocation tactics with them. Survey researchers have discovered that sending a mo netary gift (a silver dollar or a $5 check) in an envelope with a mailed questionnaire greatly increases survey completion rates, compared to offering the same monetary am ount as an after-the-fact reward (Church, 1993; Warriner, Goyder, Gjertsen, Horner , & McSpurren, 1996). Indeed, one study showed that mailing a $5 \"gift\" check along with an insurance su rvey was twice as effective as offering a $50 payment for send ing back a completed survey (James & Bolstein, 1992). Similarly, food servers have learned that simply giving customers a candy or mint along with their bill significan tly increases tips (Lynn & McCall, 1998). In general, business operators have found that, after accepting a gift, customers are willing to purchase products and services th ey would have otherwise declined (Gruner, 1996). "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"26 Chapter 2 It appears that the give-and- take of social interaction is recognized well before adulthood. One fifth-grade teacher wrote to me about a test sh e gives her students on the proper use of the past, present, and future te nses. To the question, The future of \"I give\" is_____?, one enterprising young man wrote, \"I take.\" He may have gotten that particular grammatical rule wrong, but he got a larger soci etal rule precisely right. Politics Politics is another arena in which the power of the reciprocity rule shows itself. Reciprocation tactics appear at every level: • At the top, elected officials engage in \"logrolling\" and the exch ange of favors that makes politics the place of strange bedfellows , indeed. The out-of-character vote of one of our elected representatives on a bill or measure can often be understood as a favor returned to the bill's sponsor. Political analysts were amazed at Lyndon Johnson's success in getting so many of his pr ograms through Congress during his early administration. Even members of Congress w ho were thought to be strongly opposed to the proposals were voting for them. Close exam ination by political sc ientists has found the cause to be not so much Johnson's political savvy as the large score of favors he had been able to provide to ot her legislators during his many years of power in the House and Senate. As president, he was able to produce a truly remarkable amount of legislation in a short time by calling in those favors. It is interesting that this same process may account for the problems Jimmy Carter had in getting his programs through Congress during his early administra tion, despite heavy Democratic majorities in both the House and Senate. Carter came to the presidency from outside the Capitol Hill establishment. He campaigned on his out side-Washington identity, saying that he was indebted to no one. Much of his legisl ative difficulty upon arri ving may be traced to the fact that no one there was indebted to him. Much the same may be said about the first-term legislation record of Washington outsider Bill Clinton. • At another level, we can see the recognized strength of the reci procity rule in the desire of corporations and individuals to pr ovide judicial and legi slative officials with gifts and favors and in the series of legal re strictions against such gifts and favors. Even with legitimate political contributions, the stockpiling of obligations often underlies the stated purpose of supporting a favorite candida te. One look at the lists of companies and organizations that contri bute to the campaigns of both major candidates in important elections gives evidence of such motives. A skeptic, requiring direct evidence of the quid pro quo expected by political contributors, mi ght look to the remarkably bald- faced admission by businessman Roger Tamraz at congressional hearings on campaign finance reform. When asked if he felt he received a good return on his contribution of $300,000, he smiled and replied, \"I th ink next time, I'll give $600,000.\" "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Reciprocation 27 Honesty of this sort is rare in politics. For the most part , the givers and takers join voices to dismiss the idea that campaign c ontributions, free trips, and Super Bowl tickets would bias the opinions of \"sober, conscientious\" government officials. As the head of one lobbying organization insiste d, there is no cause for concern because \"These [government officials] are smart, mature, sophisticated men and women at the top of their professions, dis posed by training to be disc erning, critical, and alert\" (Barker, 1998). And, of course, the politic ians concur. Regularly, we hear them proclaiming total independence from the fee lings of obligation th at influence everyone else. One of my own state representatives left no room for doubt when describing his accountability to gift-givers, \"It gets them exactly what it gets ev erybody else: nothing\" (Foster, 1991). Excuse me if I, as a scientist, laugh. Sobe r, conscientious scientists know better. One reason they know better is that these \"smart , mature, sophisticated men and women at the top of their [scientific] professions\" have found themselves to be as susceptible as anyone else to the process. Take the cas e of the medical controversy surrounding the safety of calcium-channel blockers, a cla ss of drugs for heart disease. One study discovered that 100 percent of the scientis ts who found and published results supportive of the drugs had received prior support (f ree trips, research funding, or employment) from the pharmaceutical companies; but only 37 percent of those critical of the drugs had received any such prior support (Stelfox, Chua, O'Rourke, & Detsky, 1998). If scientists, \"disposed by traini ng to be discerning, critical, and alert,\" can be swayed by the insistent undertow of exchange, we should fully expect that politicians will be, too. Elected and appointed officials often see themselves as immune to the rules that apply to rest of us—parking regulations and the like. But, to indulge them in this conceit when it comes to the rule of reciprocity is not only laughable, it's dangerous. The Not-So-Free Sample Of course, the power of reciprocity can be found in the mercha ndising field as well. Although the number of examples is large, le t's examine a pair of familiar ones. As a marketing technique, the free samp le has a long and effective hi story. In most instances, a small amount of the relevant product is given to potential customers to see if they like it. Certainly this is a legitimate desire of the manufacturer—to expose the public to the qualities of the product. The beau ty of the free sample, however, is that it is also a gift and, as such, can engage the reciprocity rule . In true jujitsu fashion, a promoter who provides free samples can rel ease the natural in-debting for ce inherent in a gift, while innocently appearing to have only the intention to inform. A favorite place for free samples is the supe rmarket, where customers are frequently given small amounts of a certain product to try. Many people find it difficult to accept samples from the always smiling attendant, re turn only the toothpick s or cups, and walk away. Instead, they buy some of the product, ev en if they might not have liked it very much. A highly effective variation on this marketing procedure is "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"28 Chapter 2 illustrated in the case, cited by Vance Packard in The Hidden Persuaders (1957), of the Indiana supermarket operator who sold an astounding 1,000 pounds of cheese in a few hours one day by putting out the cheese and in viting customers to cut off slivers for themselves as free samples. A different version of the free-sample tactic is used by the Amway Corporation, a rapid- growth company that manufacturers a nd distributes household and personal- "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Reciprocation 29 care products in a vast na tional network of door-to-door neighborhood sales. The company, which has grown from a basement-ru n operation to a $1.5 bi llion yearly sales business, makes use of the free sample in a device called the BUG. The BUG consists of a collection of Amway pr oducts—bottles of furniture po lish, detergent, or shampoo, spray containers of deodorizers, insect ki llers, or window cleaners— carried to a customer's home in a specially designed tray or just a polyethylene bag. The confidential Amway Career Manual then instructs the salesperson to leave the BUG with the customer \"for 24,48, or 72 hours, at no cost or obligation to her. Just tell her you would like her to try the products.... That's an offer no one can refuse.\" At the end of the trial period, the Amway representative is to retu rn and pick up orders for the products the customer wishes to purchase. Since few customers use up the entire contents of even one of the product containers in such a short time, the salesperson may then take the remaining product portions in the BUG to the next potential customer down the line or across the street a nd start the process again. Many Amway representatives have several B UGS circulating in their distri cts at one time. Of course, by now you and I know that the customer w ho has accepted and used the BUG products has been trapped by the reciprocity rule. Ma ny such customers yield to a sense of obligation to order the products that they have tried and partially consumed—and, of course, by now the Amway Corporation knows that to be the case. Even in a company with as excellent a growth record as Amway, the BUG device has created a big stir. Reports by state distributors to the pare nt company record a remarkable effect: Unbelievable! We've never seen such excitement. Product is moving at an unbelievable rate, and we've only just begun. . ..

On the average, custome rs purchased about half the total amount of the BUG when it is picked up.... In one wor d, tremendous! We've never seen a response within our entire organization like th is [from Massachusetts distributor]. The Amway distributors appear to be bewildered—happily so, but nonetheless bewildered—by the startling pow er of the BUG. Of course, by now you and I should not be. The reciprocity rule governs many situations of a purely interpersonal nature where neither money nor commercial exchange is at issue. Perhaps my favorite illustration of the enormous force available from the reci procation weapon of influence comes from such a situation. The European scientist Eibl -Eibesfeldt (1975) provides the account of a German soldier during World War I whose job was to capture enemy soldiers for interrogation. Because of the nature of the trench warfare at that time, it was extremely difficult for armies to cross the no-man's-land between opposing front lines, but it was not so difficult for a single soldier to crawl across and slip into an "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"30 Chapter 2 enemy trench position. The armies of the Grea t War had experts who regularly did so to capture enemy soldiers, who would then be brought back for questioning. The German expert had often successfully completed such missions in the past and was sent on another. Once again, he skillfully negotia ted the area between fronts and surprised a lone enemy soldier in his trench. The unsusp ecting soldier, who had been eating at the time, was easily disarmed. The frightened captive, with only a piece of bread in his hand, then performed what may have been the most important act of his life. He gave his enemy some of the bread. So affected was the German by this gift that he could not complete his mission. He turned from his be nefactor and recrosse d the no-man's-land empty-handed to face the wrath of his superiors. An equally compelling point regarding the power of reciprocity comes from an account of a woman who saved her own life, not by giving a gift as did the captured soldier, but by refusing a gift and the powerful obligations that went with it. In November 1978 Jim Jones the leader of Jonestown, Guyana, called for the mass suic ide of all residents, most of whom compliantly drank and died from a vat of poison-laced Kool-Aid. Diane Louie, a resident, however, rejected Jones's comma nd and made her way out of Jonestown and into the jungle. She attributes her willingne ss to do so to her earlier refusal to accept special favors from him when she was in n eed. She turned down his offer of special food while she was ill, because \"I knew once he gave me those privileges, he'd have me. I didn't want to owe him nothin' \" (Anderson & Zimbardo, 1984). The Rule Enforces Uninvited Debts Earlier we suggested that the pow er of the reciprocity rule is such that, by first doing us a favor, strange, disliked, or unwelcome othe rs can enhance the chance that we will comply with one of their requests. However, there is another aspect of the rule, in addition to its power, that allows this phenomenon to occur. A person can trigger a feeling of indebtedness by doing us an uninvited favor (Paese & Gilin, 2000). Recall that the rule states only that we should provi de to others the kind of actions they have provided us; it does not require us to have as ked for what we have received in order to feel obligated to repay. For instance, the American Disabled Ve terans organization reports that its simple mail appeal for dona tions produces a response rate of about 18 percent. But when the mailing also includes an unsolicited gift (g ummed, individualized address labels), the succ ess rate nearly doubles to 35 percen t. This is not to say that we might not feel a stronger sense of obligati on to return a favor we have requested, but such a request is not necessary to produce our feeling of indebtedness. If we reflect for a moment about the social purpose of the reciprocity rule, we can see why this is the case. The rule was establishe d to promote the development of reciprocal relationships between individua ls so that one person could initiate such a relationship without the fear of loss. If the rule is to serve that purpose, then an un "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Reciprocation 31 invited first favor must have the ability to create an obligati on. Recall, also, that reciprocal relationships conf er an extraordinary advant age upon cultures that foster them and that, consequently, there will be st rong pressures to ensure that the rule does serve its purpose. Litt le wonder, then, that influentia l French anthropo logist Marcel Mauss (1954), in describing the social pre ssures surrounding the gift-giving process in human culture, says that there is an obligati on to give, an obligation to receive, and an obligation to repay. Although an obligation to repay constitutes the essence of the recipr ocity rule, it is the obligation to receive that makes the rule so easy to exploit. An obligation to receive reduces our ability to choose those to whom we wish to be indebted and puts the power in the hands of others. Let's reexamine a pair of earlier examples to see how the process works. First, in the Regan study, we find that the favor causing subjects to double the number of raffle tickets purchased from Jo e was not one they had requested. Joe had voluntarily left the room and returned w ith one Coke for himself and one for the subject. There was not a single subject who re fused the Coke. It is easy to see why it would have been awkward to turn down Joe' s favor: Joe had already spent his money; a soft drink was an appropriate favor in th e situation, especially since Joe had one himself; it would have been considered impolite to reject Joe's thoughtful action. Nevertheless, receipt of that Coke produced a feeling of indebtedness that became clear when Joe announced his desire to sell some raffle tickets. Notice the important asymmetry here—all the genuinely free choices were Joe' s. He chose the form of the initial favor, and he chose the form of the re turn favor. Of course, one could say that the subject had the choice of refusing both of Jo e's offers, but those would have been tough choices. To have said no at either point would have required the subject to go against the natural cultural forces favoring reciprocation. The extent to which even an unwanted favor, once received, can produce indebtedness is aptly illustrated in the soliciting tech nique of the Hare Kr ishna Society. During systematic observation of the Krishnas' so liciting strategy, I r ecorded a variety of responses from target persons. One of the most regular was as follows: An airport visitor — a businessman — is hurriedly walking along through a densely peopled area. The Krishna solicitor steps in front of him and hands him a flower. The man, reacting with surprise, takes it. 2 Almost immediately, 2 Surprise is an effective compliance producer in its own right. Pe ople who are surprised by a request will often comply because they are momentarily unsure of themselves and, consequently, influenced easily. For example, social psychologist s Stanley Milgram and John Sabini (1975) have shown that people ri ding on the New York subway were twice as likely to give up their seats to a person who surprised them with the request, \"Excuse me. May I have your seat?\" than to one w ho forewarned them first by mentioning to a fellow passenger that he or sh e was thinking of asking for so meone's seat (56 versus 28 percent). "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"32 Chapter 2 he tries to give it back, saying he does not want the flower. The Krishna member responds that it is a gift from the Krishna Socie ty and that it is the man's to keep . . . however, a donation to further the Society's good works would be appreciated. Again the target protests, \"I don't want this flo wer. Here, take it.\" And again the solicitor refuses, \"It's our gift to you, sir.\" There is visible conflict on the businessman's face. Should he keep the flower and wa lk away without giving anythi ng in return, or should he yield to the pressure of the deeply ingrained re ciprocity rule and provide a contribution? By now, the conflict has spre ad from his face to his posture. He leans away from his benefactor, seemingly about to break free, only to be drawn back again by the pull of the rule. Once more his body tilts away, but it's no use; he cannot disengage. With a nod of resignation, he fishes in his pocket and comes up with a dollar or two that is graciously accepted. Now he c an walk away freely, and he does, \"gift\" in hand, until he encounters a waste container — where he throws the flower, with force. Purely by accident, I happened to witness a sc ene that demonstrates that the Krishnas know very well how frequently their gift s are unwanted by the people who receive them. While spending a day observing a soliciting Krishna group at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport a few years ago, I no ticed that one of the group members would frequently leave the central area and return with more flowers to resup-ply her companions. As it happened, I had decided to take a break just as she was leaving on one of her supply missions. Having nowhere to go, I followed her. Her journey turned out to be a garbage route. She went from trash can to trash can beyond the immediate area to retrieve all the flowers that had b een discarded by Krishna targets. She then returned with the cache of recovered flowers (some that had been recycled who knows how many times) and distributed them to be profitably cycled through the reciprocation process once more. What really impressed me about all this was that most of the discarded flowers had brought donations from the people who had cast them away. The nature of the reciprocity rule is such that a gift so unwanted that it was thrown away at the first opportunity ha d nonetheless been effective and exploitable. The ability of uninvited gifts to produce feelin gs of obligation is recognized by a variety of organizations besides the Krishnas. How many times has each of us received small gifts through the mail—personalized addre ss labels, greeting cards, key rings—from charitable agencies that ask for funds in an accompanying note? I ha ve received five in just the past year, two from disabled ve terans' groups and the others from missionary schools and hospitals. In each case, there was a common thread in the accompanying message. The goods that were enclosed were to be considered a gift from the organization; and money I wished to send shoul d not be regarded as payment but rather as a return offering. As the letter from one of the missionary programs stated, the packet of greeting cards I had been sent was not to be directly paid for "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Reciprocation 33 but was designed \"to encourage your [my] kindness.\" If we look past the obvious tax advantage, we can see why it w ould be beneficial for the or ganization to have the cards viewed as a gift instead of merchandise: There is a st rong cultural pressure to reciprocate a gift, even an unwanted one; but there is no su ch pressure to purchase an unwanted commercial product. The Rule Can Trigger Unequal Exchanges There is yet another feature of the reciprocit y rule that allows it to be exploited for profit. Paradoxically, although the rule deve loped to promote equal exchanges between partners, it can be used to bring about d ecidedly unequal results. The rule demands that one sort of action be reciprocated with a simila r sort of action. A favor is to be met with another favor; it is not to be met with negl ect and certainly not with attack; however, considerable flexibility is allowed. A sm all initial favor can produce a sense of obligation to agree to a substantially larger re turn favor. Since, as we have already seen, the rule allows one person to choose the nature of the indebting first favor and the nature of the debt-can celing return favor, we could easily be manipulat ed into an unfair exchange by those who might wish to exploit the rule. Once again, we turn to the Regan experiment for evidence. Remember in that study, Joe gave one group of subjects a bottle of Coca-Cola as an initiating gift and later asked all subjects to buy some of his raffle tickets at 25 cents apiece. What I have so far neglected to mention is that the study was done in th e late 1960s, when the price of a Coke was a dime. On the average, subjects who had been given a 10-cent drink bought two of Joe's raffle tickets, although some bought as many as seven. Even if we look just at the average, though, we can tell that Joe made quite a deal. A 500 percent return on investment is respectable indeed! In Joe's case, though, even a 500 percent retu rn amounted to only 50 cents. Can the reciprocity rule produce meaningfully large differences in the sizes of the exchanged favors? Under the right circumstances, it ce rtainly can. Take, for instance, the account of a student of mine concerni ng a day she remembers ruefully. About one year ago, I couldn't start my car. As I was sitting there, a guy in the parking lot came over and eventually jump-started the car. I said thanks, and he said you 're welcome; as he was leaving, I said that if he ever needed a favor to stop by. About a month later, the guy knocked on my door and asked to borrow my car for two hours as his was in the shop. I felt somewhat obligated but uncertain, since the car was pretty new and he looked very young. Later, I f ound out that he was underage and had no insurance. Anyway, I lent him the car. He totaled it. How could it happen that an intelligent young woman would agree to turn over her new car to a virtual stranger (and a youngster at that) because he had done her a "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"34 Chapter 2 small favor a month earlier? Or, more generall y, why should it be that small first favors often stimulate larger return favors? On e important reason c oncerns the clearly unpleasant character of the feeling of indebtedness. Most of us find it highly disagreeable to be in a state of obligation. It weighs heavily on us and demands to be removed. It is not difficult to trace the s ource of this feeling. Because reciprocal arrangements are so vital in human social systems, we have been conditioned to feel uncomfortable when beholden. If we were to ig nore the need to return another's initial favor, we would stop one reciprocal sequen ce dead and make it less likely that our benefactor would do such favors in the future. Neither event is in the best interests of society. Consequently, we ar e trained from childhood to ch afe, emotionally, under the saddle of obligation. For this reason alone, th en, we may be willing to agree to perform a larger favor than the one we received, mere ly to relieve ourselve s of the psychological burden of debt. There is another reason as well. A person w ho violates the reciprocity rule by accepting without attempting to return the good acts of others is disliked by the social group. The exception, of course, occurs when a person is prevented from repayment by reasons of circumstance or ability. For the most part, however, there is a genuine distaste for an individual who fails to conform to the dictates of the reciprocity rule. 3 Moocher and ingrate are unsavory labels to be scrupulously shunned. So undesirable are they that people will sometimes agree to an une qual exchange in or der to dodge them. In combination, the reality of internal discom fort and the possibility of external shame can produce a heavy psychological cost. When seen in the light of this cost, it is not so puzzling that, in the name of reciprocity, we will often give back more than we have received. Neither is it so odd that we will often avoid asking for a needed favor if we will not be in a position to repay it (De Paulo, Nadler, & Fisher, 1983; Greenberg & Shapiro, 1971; Riley & Eckenrode, 1986). The psychological cost may simply outweigh the material loss. The risk of still other kinds of losses may also persuade pe ople to decline certain gifts and benefits. Women frequently comment on the uncomfortable sense of obligation they can feel to return the favors of a man who has given them an expensive present or paid for a costly evening out. Even something as small as the price of a drink can produce a feeling of debt. A student in one of my classes expressed it quite plainly in a paper she wrote: \"After learning the hard way, I no longer let a guy I meet in a club buy me a drink because I don't want either of us to feel that I am obligated sexually.\" Research suggests that there is a basis for her concern. If, in- 3 Interestingly enough, a cross- cultural study ha s shown that those who break the reciprocity rule in the re verse direction—by giving withou t allowing the recipient an opportunity to repay—are also disliked for it. This result was found to hold for each of the three nationalities investigated—Ame ricans, Swedes, and Japanese (Gergen, Ellsworth, Maslach, & Seipel, 1975).

The rule for reciprocity applies to most relationships; however, in its purest form reciprocity is unnecessary and undesirable in certain long-te rm relationships such as families or established friendships. In thes e \"communal\" relationships (Clark & Mills, 1979; Mills & Clark, 1982), what is exchanged r eciprocally is the willingness to provide what the other needs, when it is needed (Clark, Mills, & Corcoran, 1989). Under this form of reciprocity, it is not necessary to ca lculate who has given more or less but only whether both parties are living up to the more general rule (Clark, 1984; Clark & Waddell, 1985; Clark, Mills, & Powell, 1986). Still, it appears that persistent inequities can lead to dissatisfactions, even in friendships.

But there is a larger lesson for all of us, as well: Little things are not always little — not when they link to the big rules of life, like reciprocity. RECIPROCAL CONCESSIONS There is a second way to employ the reciprocity rule to get someone to comply with a request. It is more subtle than the direct route of providing that person with a favor and then asking for one in return, yet in some ways it is much more effective. A personal experience I had a few years ago gave me firsthand evidence of just how well this compliance technique works. I was walking down the street when I was a pproached by an 11- or 12-year-old boy. He introduced himself and said he was selling ticke ts to the annual Boy Scouts Circus to be held on the upcoming Saturday night. He asked if I wished to buy any tickets at $5 apiece. Since one of the last places I wanted to spend Saturday evening was with the Boy Scouts, I declined. \"Well, \" he said, if you don't want to buy any tickets, how about buying some of our chocolate bars? They'r e only $1 each.\" I bought a couple and, right away, realized that something noteworthy had happened. I knew that to be the case because (a) I do not like chocol ate bars; (b) I do like dol- "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Reciprocation 37 ars; (c) I was standing there with two of his chocolate ba rs; and (d) he was walking away with two of my dollars. To try to understand precisely what had happened, I went to my office and called a meeting of my research assistants. In discus sing the situation, we began to see how the reciprocity rule was implicated in my co mpliance with the reque st to buy the candy bars. The general rule says th at a person who acts in a certain way toward us is entitled to a similar return action. We have already se en that one consequenc e of the rule is an obligation to repay favors we have received. Another consequence of the rule, however, is an obligation to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us. As my research group thought about it, we real ized that was exactly the position the Boy Scout had put me in. His request that I purchas e some $1 chocolate bars had been put in the form of a concession on hi s part; it was presented as a re treat from his request that I buy some $5 tickets. If I were to live up to th e dictates of the reciprocation rule, there had to be a concession on my part. As we have seen, there was such a concession: I changed from noncompliant to compliant when he moved from a larger to a smaller request, even though I was not really interested in either of the things he offered. It was a classic example of the way a wea pon of influence can infuse a compliance request with its power. I had been moved to buy something, not because of any favorable feelings toward the item, but becau se the purchase request had been presented in a way that drew force from the reciprocity rule. It had not matte red that I do not like chocolate bars; the Boy Scout ha d made a concession to me, click, and whirr, I responded with a concession of my own. Of c ourse, the tendency to reciprocate with a concession is not so strong that it will work in all instances on all people; none of the weapons of influence considered in this book is that strong. However, in my exchange with the Boy Scout, the tendency had been sufficiently powerful to leave me in mystified possession of a pair of unwanted and overpriced candy bars. Why should I feel obliged to reciprocate a concession? The answer rests once again in the benefit of such a tendency to the society. It is in the interest of any human group to have its members working together to ward the achievement of common goals. However, in many social interactions the participants begin w ith requirements and demands that are unacceptable to one another. Thus, the society must arrange to have these initial, incompatible desires set as ide for the sake of socially beneficial cooperation. This is accomplished through procedures that promote compromise. Mutual concession is one important such procedure. The reciprocation rule brings about mutual concession in tw o ways. The first is obvious; it pressures the recipient of an already-made concession to respond in kind. The second, while not so obvious, is pivotally important . Because of a recipient's obligation to reciprocate, people are freed to make the initial concession and, thereby, to begin the beneficial process of exchange. After all, if there were no social obligation to reciprocate a concession, who would want to make the first sacrifice? To do so would be to risk giving up something and ge tting nothing back. However, with "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Reciprocation 38 the rule in effect, we can feel safe making the first sacrifice to our partner, who is obligated to offer a return sacrifice. REJECTION-THEN-RETREAT _______________________________ Because the rule for reciprocation governs the compromise process, it is possible to use an initial concession as part of a highly effective compliance t echnique. The technique is a simple one that we will call the rejec tion-then-retreat technique, although it is also known as the door-in-the-face technique. Suppose you want me to agree to a certain request. One way to increase the chances that I will comply is first to make a larger request of me, one that I will most likely turn down. Then, afte r I have refused, you make the smaller request that you were really interested in all along. Provided that you structured your requests skillfully, I should vi ew your second request as a concession to me and should feel inclined to respond with a concession of my own—compliance with your second request. Was that the way the Boy Scout got me to buy his candy bars? Was his retreat from the $5 request to the $1 request an artificial one that was intentionally designed to sell candy bars? As one who has still refused to discard even his first Scout merit badge, I genuinely hope not. Whether or not the la rge-request-then-small-request sequence was planned, its effect was the same. It worked! Be cause it works, the rejection-then-retreat technique can and will be used purposely by certain people to get their way. First let's examine how this tactic can be used as a reliable compliance device. Later we will see how it is already being used. Finally we can tu rn to a pair of little-known features of the technique that make it one of the most influential compliance tactics available. Remember that after my enc ounter with the Boy Scout, I called my re search assistants together to try to understand what had happene d to me—and, as it turned out, to eat the evidence. Actually, we did more than that. We designed an experiment to test the effectiveness of the procedure of moving to a desired request after a larger preliminary request had been refused. We had two purposes in conducting the experiment. First, we wanted to see whether this procedure worked on people besides me. (It certainly seemed that the tactic had been effective on me earlie r in the day, but then I have a history of falling for compliance tricks of all sorts.) So the question remaine d, \"Does the rejection- then-retreat technique work on enough people to make it a useful procedure for gaining compliance?\" If so, it would definitely be so mething to be aware of in the future. Our second reason for doing the study was to de termine how powerful a compliance device the technique was. Could it bring about comp liance with a genuinely sizable request? In other words, did the smaller request to which the requester retreated have to be a small request? If our thinking about what caused the technique to be effective was correct, the second request did not actually have to be small; it only had to be smaller than the initial one. It was our suspicion that the critical aspect of a requester's retreat from a larger to a smaller favor was its appearance as a concession. So the second request could be an objectively large one—as long as it was smaller than the first request—and the technique would still work."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"39 Chapter 2 After a bit of thought, we decided to try th e technique on a request that we felt few people would agree to perform. Posing as representatives of the \"County Youth Counseling Program,\" we approached colleg e students walking on campus and asked if they would be willing to chaperon a group of juvenile delinquents on a day trip to the zoo. This idea of being responsible for a gr oup of juvenile delinque nts of unspecified age for hours in a public place without pay was hardly an inviting one for these students. As we expected, the great majority (83 percent) refused. Yet we obtained very different results from a similar sample of college students who were asked the very same question with one difference. Before we invited them to serve as unpaid chaperons on the zoo trip, we asked them for an even larger favor—to spe nd two hours per week as counselors to juvenile deli nquents for a minimum of two y ears. It was only after they refused this extreme request, as all did, that we made the small, zoo-trip request. But presenting the zoo trip as a retreat from our initial request, our success rate increased dramatically. Three times as many of th e students approached in this manner volunteered to serve as zoo chaperons (Ciald ini, Vincent, Lewis, Catalan, Wheeler, & Darby, 1975). Be assured that any strategy able to triple the percentage of compliance with a substantial request (from 17 to 50 percent in our experiment) will be used often in a variety of natural settings. La bor negotiators, for instance, of ten use the tactic of making extreme demands that they do not expect to win but from which they can retreat and draw real concessions from the opposing side. It would appear, the n, that the procedure would be more effective the larger the init ial request, since there would be more room available for illusory concessions. This is true only up to a poi nt, however. Research conducted at Barllan University in Israel on the rejection-then-re treat technique shows that if the first set of demands is so extreme as to be seen as unreasonable, the tactic backfires (Schwarzwald, Raz, & Zvibel, 1979) . In such cases, the party who has made the extreme first request is not seen to be bargaining in good faith. Any subsequent retreat from that wholly unrealistic initial pos ition is not viewed as a genuine concession and, thus, is not reciprocate d. The truly gifted negotiator, then, is one whose initial position is exaggerated just enough to allow for a series of small reciprocal concessions and counteroffers that will yield a desira ble final offer from the opponent (Thompson, 1990). I witnessed another form of the rejection-then -retreat technique in my investigations of door-to-door sales operations. These organi zations used a less engineered, more opportunistic version of the tactic. Of course , the most important goal for a door-to-door salesperson is to make the sale. However, the training programs of each of the companies I investigated emphasized that a second important goal was to obtain from prospects the names of referrals—friends , relatives, or neighbors, on whom the salesperson could call. For a variety of reas ons, which we will discuss in Chapter 5, the percentage of successful door-to-door sa les increases impressively when the "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"40 Chapter 2 sales representative is able to mention the name of a familiar person who \"recommended\" the sales visit. Never as a sales trainee was I taught to get th e sales pitch refused so that I could then retreat to a request for referrals. In severa l such programs, though, I was trained to take advantage of the opportunity to secure re ferrals offered by a customer's purchase refusal: \"Well, if it is your feeling that a fine set of encyclopedias is not right for you at this time, perhaps you could help me by givi ng me the names of some others who might wish to take advantage of our company's great offer. What would be the names of some of these people you know?\" Many individuals who would not otherwise subject their friends to a high-pressure sales presentati on do agree to supply referrals when the request is presented as a concession from a purchase request they have just refused. Reciprocal Concessions, Perceptual Contrast, and the Watergate Mystery We have already discussed one reason for the success of the rejection-then-retreat technique—its incorporation of the reciprocity rule. This larger-then-smaller-request  "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Reciprocation 41 strategy is effective for a pair of other reason s as well. The first concerns the perceptual contrast principle we encountered in Chap ter 1. That principle accounted for, among other things, the tendency of a man to spend more money on a sweater following his purchase of a suit than before : After being exposed to the price of the larger item, he sees the price of the less expensive item as appearing smaller by comparison. In the same way, the larger-then-smaller request proc edure uses the contrast principle to make the smaller request look even smaller by compar ison with the larger one. If I want you to lend me $5,1 can make the request seem sm aller than it is by first asking you to lend me $10. One of the beauties of this tactic is that, by first requesting $10 and then retreating to $5,1 will have simu ltaneously engaged the force of both the reciprocity rule and the contrast principle. Not only will my $5 request be viewed as a concession to be reciprocated, it will also look like a smaller request than if I had just asked for $5 straightaway. In combination, the influences of reciprocity a nd perceptual contra st can present a fearsomely powerful force. Embodied in the rejection-then-retreat sequence, they are jointly capable of genuinely astonishing effect s. It is my feeling that they provide the only really plausible explanat ion of one of the most baff ling political actions of our time: the decision to break into the Waterg ate offices of the Democratic National Committee that led to the ruin of Richard Ni xon's presidency. One of the participants in that decision, Jeb Stuart Ma gruder, upon hearing that the Wa tergate burglars had been caught, responded with appropriate bewilder ment, \"How could we have been so stupid?\" Indeed, how? To understand how enormously ill-concei ved an idea it was for the Nixon administration to undertake the brea k-in, let's review a few facts: • The idea was that of G. Gordon Liddy, who was in charge of intelligence-gathering operations for the Committee to Re-elect th e President (CREEP). Liddy had gained a reputation among administration higher-ups as \"flaky,\" and there were questions about his stability and judgment. • Liddy's proposal was extremely costl y, requiring a budget of $250,000 in un-traceable cash. • In late March, when the proposal was appr oved in a meeting of the CREEP director, John Mitchell, and his assistants Magrude r and Frederick LaRue, the outlook for a Nixon victory in the November election coul d not have been brighter. Edmund Muskie, the only announced candidate the early po lls had given a chance of unseating the president, had done poorly in the primaries. It looked very much as though the most defeatable candidate, George McGovern, would win the Democratic nomination. A Republican victory seemed assured. "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Reciprocation 42 • The break-in plan itself was a highly ris ky operation requiring th e participation and discretion of ten men. • The Democratic National Committee a nd its chairman, Lawrence O'Brien, whose Watergate office was to be burglarized and bugged, had no information damaging enough to defeat the incumbent president. Nor were the Democrats likely to get any, unless the administration did something very, very foolish. "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"43 Chapter 2 Despite the obvious counsel of the previously mentioned reasons, the expensive, chancy, pointless, and potentially calamit ous proposal of a man whose judgment was known to be questionable was approved. How could it be that intelligent, accomplished men such as Mitchell and Ma gruder would do something so very, very foolish? Perhaps the answer lies in a little-discussed fact: The $250,000 plan they approved was not Liddy's first proposal. In fact, it represented a significant concession on his part from two earlier proposals of imme nse proportions. The first of these plans, made two months earlier in a meeting with Mitchell , Magruder, and John Dean, described a $1 million program that included (in addition to the bugging of the Watergate) a specially equipped communications \"cha se plane,\" break-ins, kidnapping and mugging squads, and a yacht featuring \"high-class call girl s\" to blackmail Democratic politicians. A second Liddy plan, presented a week later to the same group of Mitchell, Magruder, and Dean, eliminated some of the program and reduced the cost to $500,000. It was only after these initial proposals had been re jected by Mitchell that Liddy submitted his \"bare-bones\" $250,000 plan, in this instance to Mitchell, Magruder, and Frederick LaRue. This time the plan, still stupid but le ss so than the previous ones, was approved. Could it be that I, a longtime patsy, and J ohn Mitchell, a hardened and canny politician, might both have been so easily maneuvere d into bad deals by the same compliance tactic—I by a Boy Scout selling candy a nd he by a man selling political disaster? If we examine the testimony of Jeb Ma gruder, considered by most Watergate investigators to provide the most faithful account of the crucial meeting at which Liddy's plan was finally accepted, there are some instructive clues. First, Magruder (1974) reports that \"no one wa s particularly overwhelmed wi th the project\"; but \"after starting at the grandiose sum of $1 million, we thought that probably $250,000 would be an acceptable figure.. .. We were reluctan t to send him away with nothing.\" Mitchell, caught up in the \"feeling that we should leave Liddy a little something .. . signed off on it in the sense of saying, 'Ok, let's give him a quarter of a million dollars and let's see what he can come up with.' \" In the contex t of Liddy's initial extreme requests, it seems that \"a quarter of a million dollars\" had come to be \"a little something\" to be left as a return concession. With the clarity afforded by hindsight, Magruder has recalled Liddy's approach in as succinct an il lustration of the rejection-then -retreat technique as I have ever heard. \"If he had come to us at the outset and said, 'I have a plan to burglarize and wiretap Larry O'Brien's office,' we might have rejected the idea ou t of hand. Instead he came to us with his elaborate call-gi rl/kidnapping/mugging/sa botage/wiretapping scheme.... He had asked for the whole loaf when he was quite content to settle for half or even a quarter.\" It is also instructive that , although he finally deferred to his boss's decision, only one member of the group, Frederick LaRue, expr essed any direct opposition to the proposal. Saying with obvious common sense, \"I don't think it's worth the risk,\" he must have wondered why his colleagues, Mitchell and Magr uder, did not share his perspective. Of course, there could be many differences betw een LaRue and the othe r two men that may have accounted for their differing opinions regarding the advis- "},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Reciprocation 44 ability of Liddy's plan. But one stands ou t: Of the three, only LaRue had not been present at the prior two meetings, where Liddy had outlined his much more ambitious programs. Perhaps, then, only LaRue was able to see the third proposal for the clunker that it was and to react to it objectively, uninfluenced by the recipr ocity and perceptual contrast forces acting upon the others. Damned If You Do, Damned If You Don't A bit earlier we said that the rejection-then -retreat technique ha d, in addition to the reciprocity rule, a pair of other factors work ing in its favor. We have already discussed the first of those factors, the perceptual co ntrast principle. The additional advantage of the technique is not really a psychological princi ple, as in the case of the other two factors. Rather, it is more of a purely struct ural feature of the request sequence. Let's once again say that I wish to borrow $5 from you. By beginning with a request for $10, 1 really can't lose. If you agree to it, I will have received from you twice the amount I would have settled for. If, on the other hand, you turn down my initial request, I can retreat to the $5 favor that I desired from the outset and, through the action of the reciprocity and contrast prin ciples, greatly enhance my likelihood of success. Either way, I benefit; it's a case of heads I win, tails you lose. The clearest utilization of this aspect of the large-then-small-request sequence occurs in the retail store sales practice of \"talking th e top of the line.\" Here the prospect is invariably shown the deluxe model first. If the customer buys, there is frosting on the store's cake. However, if the customer declines, the salesperson effectively counteroffers with a more reasonably priced model. Some proof of the effectiveness of this procedure comes from a report in Sales Management magazine, reprinted without comment in Consumer Reports: If you were a billiard-table dealer, which would you advertise — the $329 model or the $3,000 model? The chances are you would promote the low-priced item and hope to trade the customer up when he comes to buy. But G. Warren Kelley, new business promotion manager at Brunswick, says y ou would be wrong.... To prove his point, Kelley has actual sales figures from a repres entative store. . . . During the first week customers .. . were shown the low end of th e line ... and then enc ouraged to consider more expensive models — the traditional trading-up approach.... The average table sale that week was $550. . .. However, during th e second week, customers .. . were led instantly to a $3,000 table, regardless of what they wanted to see . . . and then allowed to shop the rest of the line, in declining order of price and q uality. The result of selling down was an average sale of over $1,000. (\"Quote,\" 1975, p. 62) Given the remarkable effectiveness of the rejection-then-retreat technique, one might think that there could be a substantial di sadvantage as well. The victims of the "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"45 Chapter 2 strategy might resent having been cornered in to compliance. The re sentment could show itself in a couple of ways. Firs t, the victim might decide not to live up to the verbal agreement made with the requester. Second, the victim might come to distrust the manipulative requester, deciding never to deal with that pe rson again. If either or both of these events occurred with any frequenc y, a requester would want to give serious second thought to the use of the rejection-th en-retreat procedure. Research indicates, however, that these victim reactions do not occur with increased frequency when the rejection-then-retreat technique is used. Some what astonishingly, it appears that they actually occur less frequently! Before trying to understand why this should be, let's first look at the evidence. Here's My Blood, and Do Call Again A study published in Canada (Miller, Selig man, Clark, & Bush, 1976) throws light on the question of whether a victim of the rej ection-then-retreat tact ic will follow through with the agreement to perform a requester's second fa vor. In addition to recording whether target persons said ye s or no to the desired request (to work for two hours a day without pay in a community mental health agency), this experiment also recorded whether they showed up to perform their dutie s as promised. As usua l, the procedure of starting with a larger request (to volunteer fo r two hours of work per week in the agency for at least two years) produced more verbal agreement to the smaller, retreat request (76 percent), than did the procedure of aski ng for the smaller request alone (29 percent). The important result, though, c oncerned the show-up rate of those who volunteered; and, again, the rejection-then-r etreat procedure was the more effective one (85 versus 50 percent). A different experiment examined whether the rejection-then-retreat sequence caused victims to feel so manipulated that they woul d refuse any further requests. In this study (Cialdini & Ascani, 1976), the targets were college students who were each asked to give a pint of blood as part of the annual campus blood drive. Targets in one group were first asked to give a pint of blood every si x weeks for a minimum of three years. The other targets were asked only to give a si ngle pint of blood. Those of both groups who agreed and later appeared at the blood center were then asked if they would be willing to give their phone numbers so they could be called upon to donate again in the future. Nearly all the students who were about to give a pint of blood as a result of the rejection-then-retreat technique agreed to dona te again (84 percent), while less than half of the other students who appeared at the blood center did so (43 percent). Even for future favors, the rejection-then -retreat strategy proved superior. The Sweet, Secret Side Effects Strangely enough, then, it seems that the rejection-then-ret reat tactic not only spurs people to agree to a desired request but actua lly to carry out the request and, finally, to volunteer to perform further requests. What could ther e be about the technique "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Reciprocation 46 that makes people who have been duped into compliance so likely to continue to comply? For an answer, we might look at a re quester's act of con cession, which is the heart of the procedure. We have already seen that, as long as it is not viewed as an obvious trick, the concession will likely stim ulate a return concession. What we have not yet examined, however, is a little-known pair of positive by-products of the act of concession: feelings of great er responsibility for and sati sfaction with the arrangement. It is this set of sweet side effects that enables the technique to move its victims to fulfill their agreements and to engage in further such agreements. The desirable side effects of making concessi ons during an interacti on with other people are nicely shown in studies of the way peopl e bargain with each other. One experiment, conducted by social psychologi sts at UCLA, offers an es pecially apt demonstration (Benton, Kelley, & Liebling, 1972). A subjec t in that study f aced a \"negotiation opponent\" and was told to barg ain with the opponent concer ning how to divide between themselves a certain amount of money provi ded by the experimenter s. The subject was also informed that if no mutual agreement could be reached after a certain period of bargaining, no one would get any money. Unknown to the subject, the opponent was really an experimental assistant who had been previously instructed to bargain with the subject in one of three ways. With some of the subjects, the oppone nt made an extreme first demand, assigning virtually all of the money to himself and stubbornly persisted in that demand throughout the ne gotiations. With another grou p of subjects, the opponent began with a demand that was moderately fa vorable to himself; he, too, steadfastly refused to move from that position during the negotiation s. With a third group, the opponent began with the extreme demand and then gradually retreated to the more moderate one during the c ourse of the bargaining. There were three important fi ndings that help us to unders tand why the rejection-then- retreat technique is so effective. First, compared to the two other approaches, the strategy of starting with an extreme demand and then retreating to the more moderate one produced the most money for the person usi ng it. This result is not very surprising in light of the previous evidence we have seen for the power of larger-then-smaller- request tactics to bring about profitable agreements. It is th e pair of additional findings of the study that are more striking. Responsibility The requester's concession within the reject ion-then-retreat technique not only caused targets to say yes more often, it also caused them to feel more re sponsible for having \"dictated\" the final agreement. Thus the unc anny ability of the re jection-then-retreat technique to make its targets meet thei r commitments becomes understandable: A person who feels responsible for the terms of a contract will be more likely to live up to that contract. Satisfaction Even though, on the average, they gave th e most money to the opponent who used the concessions strategy, the subj ects who were the targets of this strategy were the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"47 Chapter 2 most satisfied with the final arrangement. It appears that an agreement that has been forged through the concessions of one's opponents is quite sa tisfying. With this in mind, we can begin to explain the second previous ly puzzling feature of the rejection-then- retreat tactic—the ability to prompt its vict ims to agree to further requests. Since the tactic uses a concession to bring about comp liance, the victim is likely to feel more satisfied with the arrangement as a result . It stands to reason that people who are satisfied with a given arrangement are more likely to be willing to agree to similar arrangements. As one study of retail sales showed, feeling respons ible for getting a better deal led to more satisfaction with the process and more repurc hases of the product (Schindler, 1998). DEFENSE _ Against a requester who employs the rule fo r reciprocation, you and I face a formidable foe. By presenting us with either an initial favor or an initial c oncession, the requester will have enlisted a powerful ally in the campaign for our compliance. At first glance, our fortunes in such a situation would a ppear dismal. We could comply with the requester's wish and, in so doing, succumb to th e reciprocity rule. Or, we could refuse to comply and thereby suffer the brunt of the rule's force upon our deeply conditioned feelings of fairness and obligation. Surre nder or suffer heavy casualties. Cheerless prospects indeed. Fortunately, these are not our only choices. W ith the proper understanding of the nature of our opponent, we can come away from the compliance battlefield unhurt and sometimes even better off than before. It is essential to recognize that the requester who invokes the reciprocation rule (or any ot her weapon of influence) to gain our compliance is not the real opponent. Such a requester has chosen to become a jujitsu warrior who aligns himself or herself with the sweeping power of reciprocation and then merely releases that power by providing a fi rst favor or concession. The real opponent is the rule. If we are not to be abused by it, we must take steps to defuse its energy. Rejecting the Rule How does one go about neutralizing the effect of a social rule like the one for reciprocation? It seems too widespread to escape and too strong to overpower once it is activated. Perhaps the answer, then, is to pr event its activation. Perhaps we can avoid a confrontation with the rule by refusing to allow a reques ter to commission its force against us in the first place. Perhaps by rejecting a requester's initial favor or concessions to us, we can ev ade the problem. Perhaps; but then, perhaps not. Invariably declining a requester's initial offer of a favor or sacrifice works better in theory than in practice. The major problem is that when it is first presented, it is difficult to know whether such an offer is honest or whether it is the initial step in an exploitation at- "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Reciprocation 48 tempt. If we always assume the worst, it w ould not be possible to r eceive the benefits of any legitimate favors or concessions offere d by individuals who had no intention of exploiting the reciprocity rule. I have a colleague who remembers with ange r how his 10-year-old daughter's feelings were terribly hurt by a man whose method of avoiding the jaws of the reciprocity rule was to refuse her kindness. The children of her class were hosting an open house at school for their grandparents, a nd her job was to give a flower to each vis itor entering the school grounds. The first man she approached with a flower growled at her, \"Keep it.\" Not knowing what to do, she extended it toward him again, only to have him demand to know what he had to give in retu rn. When she replied w eakly, \"Nothing. It's a gift,\" he fixed her with a disbelieving glar e, insisting that he recognized \"her game,\" and brushed on past. The girl was so st ung by the experience that she could not approach anyone else and had to be re moved from her assignment — one she had anticipated fondly. It is hard to know whom to blame more, the insensitive man or the exploiters who had abused his tendency to reciprocate a gift until his response had soured to a refusal. No matter whom you fi nd more blameworthy, th e lesson is clear. We will always encounter authentically gene rous individuals as well as many people who try to play fairly by the reciprocity rule rather than to exploit it. They will doubtless become insulted by someone who consistently rejects their efforts; social friction and isolation could well result. A policy of blanket rejection, then, seems ill advised. Another solution holds more promise. It advise s us to accept the offers of others but to accept those offers only for what they f undamentally are, not for what they are represented to be. If a person offers us a nice favor, let' s say, we might well accept, recognizing that we have obligated ourselves to a return favor sometime in the future. To engage in this sort of arrangement with another is not to be exploited by that person through the rule for reciprocation. Quite the c ontrary; it is to participate fairly in the \"honored network of obligation\" that has served us so well, both individually and societally, from the dawn of humanity. However, if the initial favor turns out to be a device, a trick, an artifice designed specifically to stim ulate our compliance with a larger return favor, that is a different st ory. Our partner is not a benefactor but a profiteer; and it is here that we should re spond to the action on precisely those terms. Once we have determined that the initial o ffer was not a favor but a compliance tactic, we need only react to it accordingly to be fr ee of its influence. As long as we perceive and define the action as a co mpliance device instead of a favor, the giver no longer has the reciprocation rule as an ally: The rule says that favors are to be met with favors; it does not require that tricks be met with favors.

Let's suppose further that you were interested in these things and made an evening appointment to have one of the association's inspectors come over to provide them. When the inspector arrived, he gave you a small hand extinguisher and began exam ining the possible fire hazards of your home. Afterward he gave you some intere sting, though frightening, information about general fire dangers, along w ith an assessment of your home' s vulnerability. Finally he suggested that you obtain a home fire wa rning system for your house and left. Such a set of events is not implausible. Various cities and towns have nonprofit associations, usually made up of fire depa rtment personnel worki ng on their own time, that provide free home fire-saf ety inspections of this sort. Were these events to occur, you would clearly have received a favor from the inspector. In accordance with the reciprocation rule, you should stand more ready to provide a return favor if you were to see him in need of aid at some point in the future. An exchange of favors of this kind would be in the best traditi on of the reciprocity rule. A similar set of events with, however, a diffe rent ending is also possible. Rather than leaving after recommending a fire-alarm sy stem, the inspector launches into a sales presentation intended to persuade you to buy an expensive, heat-triggered alarm system manufactured by the company he represents . Door-to-door home fire-alarm companies will frequently use this approach. Typical ly, their product, while effective enough, will be overpriced. Trusting that you will not be familiar with the retail costs of such a system and that, if you decide to buy one, you will feel obligated to the company that provided you with a free extinguisher and home inspection, these companies will pressure you for an immediate sale. Using this free-information-and-inspection gambit, fire-protection sales organizations have flourished around the country. 4 If you were to find yourself in such a situa tion with the realizat ion that the primary motive of the inspector's visit was to sell you a costly alarm system, your most effective next action would be a simple, private mane uver. It would involve the mental act of redefinition. Merely define whatever you have received from the inspector— extinguisher, safety information, hazard insp ection—not as gifts but as sales devices, and you will be free to declin e (or accept) the purchase offe r without even a tug from 4 A variety of other business operations use th e no-cost information offer extensively. Pest exterminator companies, for instance, have found that most pe ople who agree to a free home examination give the extermination job to the examining company, provided they are convinced that it is needed. They a pparently feel an oblig ation to give their business to the firm that rendered the initial, complimentary service. Knowing that such customers are unlikely to comparison shop for this reason, unscrupulous pest control operations will take advantage of the situation by citing higher-than-competitive prices for work commissioned in this way. "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Reciprocation 50 the reciprocity rule: A favor rightly follows a favor—not a piece of sales strategy. If the inspector subsequently responds to your re fusal by proposing that you, at least, provide the names of some friends he might call on, use your mental maneuver again. Define this retreat to a smaller request as what you recognize it to be—a compliance tactic. Once this is done, there would be no pressure to offer the na mes as a return concession, since the reduced request would not be view ed as a real concession. At this point, unhampered by an inappropriately triggered sense of obligation, you may once again be as compliant or noncompliant as you wish. Provided you are so inclined, you might ev en turn the inspector's own weapon of influence against him. Recall that the rule for reciprocation en titles a person who has acted in a certain way to a dose of the same thing. If you have determ ined that the \"fire inspector's\" gifts were used, not as genuine gifts, but to make a profit from you, then you might want to use them to make a prof it of your own. Simply take whatever the inspector is willing to pr ovide—safety information, home extinguisher— thank him politely, and show him out the door. After all, th e reciprocity rule asserts that if justice is to be done, exploitation attempts should be exploited. READER'S REPORT 2.2 From a Former Television and Stereo Salesperson For quite a while, I worked for a major retailer in their television and stereo department. Continued employment was based on the abi lity to sell service contracts which are warranty extensions offered by the retailer. On ce this fact was explained to me I devised the following plan that used the rejection- then-retreat technique, although I didn't know its name at the time. A customer had the opportunity to buy from one to three years' worth of service contract coverage at the time of the sale, although the credit I got was the same regardless of the length of coverage. Realizing th at most people would not be willing to buy three years' worth of coverage, initially, I would advocat e to the customer the longest and most expensive plan. This gave me an excellent oppor tunity later, after being rejected in my sincere attempt to sell the three-year plan, to retreat to the one-year extension and its relatively small price, which I was thrilled to get. This technique proved highly effective, as I sold sales contracts to an average of 70 percent of my customers, who seemed very satisfied in the process, while others in my department clustered around 40 percent. I never told any one how I did it until now. Author's note: Notice how, as is usually the ca se, use of the rejection-then-retreat tactic also engages the action of the contrast princi ple. Not only did the initial higher request make the lower one seem like a retreat, it m ade that second request seem smaller, too. "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 Commitment and Consistency Hobgoblins of the Mind 52 It is easier to resist at the beginning t han at the end. —LEONARDO DA VINCI "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"A study done by a pair of Canadian psyc hologists (Knox & Inkster, 1968) uncovered something fascinating about people at the ra cetrack: just after placing bets they are much more confident of their horses' chan ces of winning than they are immediately before laying down the bets. Of course, nothing about the horse's chances actually shifts; it's the same horse, on the same track, in the same field; but in the minds of those bettors, its prospects improve significantly onc e that ticket is pur chased. Although a bit puzzling at first glance, the reason for the dramatic change has to do with a common weapon of social influence. Like the other weapons of influence, this one lies deep within us, directing our actions with quiet pow er. It is, quite simply, our desire to be (and to appear) consistent with what we have already done. Once we make a choice or take a stand, we will enc ounter personal and interpe rsonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment. Those pressures will cause us to respond in ways that justify our earlier decision. We simply convince ours elves that we have made the right choice and, no doubt, feel better about our decision (Faz io, Blascovich, & Driscoll, 1992). By way of illustration, let's examine the st ory of my neighbor Sara and her live-in boyfriend, Tim. After they met, they dated fo r a while, even after Tim lost his job, and eventually moved in together. Things were never perfect for Sara: She wanted Tim to marry her and to stop his heavy drinking; Tim resisted both ideas. After an especially difficult period of conflict, Sara broke off the relationship and Ti m moved out. At the same time, an old boyfriend of Sara's called her. They started seei ng each other socially and quickly became engaged and made wedding plans. They had gone so far as to set a date and issue invitations when Tim called. He had repented and wanted to move back in. When Sara told him her marriage plans, he begged her to change her mind; he wanted to be together with her as before . Sara refused, saying she didn't want to live like that again. Tim even offered to marry her, but she still said she preferred the other boyfriend. Finally, Tim volunteered to quit dr inking if she would only relent. Feeling that under those conditions Tim had the edge , Sara decided to break her engagement, cancel the wedding, retract the invitations, and let Tim move back in with her. Within a month, Tim informed Sara that he di dn't think he needed to stop drinking after all. A month later, he decided that they should \"wait and see\" before getting married. Two years have since passed; Tim and Sara c ontinue to live together exactly as before. Tim still drinks, and there are still no marriage plans, yet Sara is more devoted to him than she ever was. She says that being for ced to choose taught her that Tim really is number one in her heart. So, after choosi ng Tim over her other boyfriend, Sara became happier, even though the conditions under whic h she had made her choice have never been fulfilled. Obviously, horse-race bettors ar e not alone in their willingness to believe in the correctness of a difficult choice once made. Indeed, we all fool ourselves from time to time in order to keep our thoughts 53 "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"54 Chapter 3 and beliefs consistent with what we have already done or decided (Conway & Ross, 1984; Goethals & Reckman, 1973; Rosenf eld, Kennedy, & Giacalone, 1986). For instance, immediately after casting a ballot, voters believe more strongly that their candidate will win (Regan & Kilduff, 1988). WHIRRING ALONG Psychologist? have long underst ood the power of the consis tency principle to direct human action. Prominent early theorists such as Leon Fest inger (1957), Fritz Heider (1946), and Theodore Newcomb (1953) viewed th e desire for consistency as a central motivator of behavior. Is this tendency to be consistent really strong enough to compel us to do what we ordina rily would not want to do? There is no question about it. The drive to be (and look) consistent constitutes a highly potent weapon of social influence, often causing us to act in ways that are clearly contrary to our own best interest. Consider what happened when researchers st aged thefts on a New York City beach to see if onlookers would risk pe rsonal harm to halt the crime. In the study, an accomplice of the researchers would put a beach blanke t down five feet from the blanket of a randomly chosen individual—the experiment al subject. After several minutes of relaxing on the blanket and listening to music from a portable radio, the accomplice would stand up and leave the blanket to stroll down the beach. Soon thereafter, a researcher, pretending to be a thief, would approach, grab the radio, and try to hurry away with it. As you might gue ss, under normal conditions, subj ects were very reluctant to put themselves in harm's way by challenging the thief—only four people did so in the 20 times that the theft was staged. But when the same procedure was tried another 20 times with a slight twist, the results were dr astically different. In th ese incidents, before leaving the blanket, the accomplice would simp ly ask the subject to please \"watch my things,\" something everyone agreed to do. No w, propelled by the ru le for consistency, 19 of the 20 subjects became virtual vigila ntes, running after and stopping the thief, demanding an explanation, often restraining th e thief physically or snatching the radio away (Moriarty, 1975). To understand why consistency is so powerfu l a motive, we should recognize that, in most circumstances, consistency is valued and adaptive. Inconsistency is commonly thought to be an undesirable personality trai t (Allgeier, Byrne, Brooks, & Revnes, 1979; Asch, 1946). The person whose beliefs, word s, and deeds don't match is seen as confused, two-faced, even mentally ill. On th e other side, a high degree of consistency is normally associated with personal and inte llectual strength. It is the heart of logic, rationality, stability, and hone sty. A quote attributed to the great British chemist, Michael Faraday, suggests the extent to whic h being consistent is approved—sometimes more than being right. When asked after a lecture if he meant to imply that a hated academic rival was always wrong, Faraday glowered at the questioner and replied, \"He's not that consistent.\" "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Commitment and Consistency 55 Certainly, then, good personal cons istency is highly valued in our culture—and well it should be. Most of the time we will be better off if our approach to things is well laced with consistency. Without it our lives would be difficu lt, erratic, and disjointed (Sheldon, Ryan, Rawsthorne, & Ilardi, 1997). The Quick Fix Since it is so typically in our best interests to be consistent, we fall into the habit of being automatically consistent even in situations where it is not the sensible way to be. When it occurs unthinkingly, consistency can be disastrous. Nonetheless, even blind consistency has its attractions. First, like most other forms of automatic responding, it offers a shortcut through the complexities of modern life. Once we have made up our minds about issues, stubborn consistency allows us a very appealing luxur y: We don't have to think hard about the issues anymore. We don't really have to sift through the blizzard of information we encounter every day to identify relevant f acts; we don't have to expend the mental energy to weigh the pros and cons; we don't have to make any further tough decisions. Instead, all we have to do when confronted with the issues is click on our consistency tape, whirr, and we know just what to believe, say, or do. We need only believe, say, or do whatever is consistent with our earlier decision. The allure of such a luxury is not to be mi nimized. It allows us a convenient, relatively effortless, and efficient method for dealing with the complexities of daily life that make severe demands on our mental energies and cap acities. It is not hard to understand, then, why automatic consistency is a difficult reaction to curb. It offers us a way to evade the rigors of continuing thought. With our cons istency tapes operating, we can go about our business happily excused from having to thi nk too much. As Sir Joshua Reynolds noted, \"There is no expedient to which a man w ill not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking.\" The Foolish Fortress There is a second, more perverse attractio n of mechanical consistency as well. Sometimes it is not the effort of hard, c ognitive work that ma kes us shirk thoughtful activity but the harsh consequences of that activity. Sometimes it is the cursedly clear and unwelcome set of answers provided by straight thinking that makes us mental slackers. There are certain disturbing things we simply would rather not realize. Because it is a preprogr ammed and mindless method of responding, automatic consistency can supply a safe hiding place from troubling realizations. Sealed within the fortress walls of rigid consistency, we can be impervious to the sieges of reason. One night at an introductory lecture given by the Transcendental Meditation program, I witnessed an illustration of the way people will hide inside the walls of consistency to protect themselves from the troublesome c onsequences of thought. The lecture itself was presided over by two earnest young men and was designed to 56"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"57 Chapter 3 recruit new members into the program. The men claimed that the program offered a unique brand of meditation (TM) which w ould allow us to achieve all manner of desirable things, ranging from simple inner peace to more spectacu lar abilities— to fly and pass through walls—at the program's a dvanced (and more expensive) stages. I had decided to attend the meeting to obser ve the kind of complia nce tactics used in recruitment lectures of this sort and had brought al ong an interested fr iend, a university professor whose areas of specialization were statistics and symbolic logic. As the meeting progressed and the lecturers explai ned the theory behi nd TM, I noticed my logician friend becoming increasingly re stless. Looking more a nd more pained and shifting about constantly in his seat, he was finally unabl e to resist. When "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Commitment and Consistency 58 the leaders called for questions at the end of the lecture, he raised his hand and gently but surely demolished the presentation we ha d just heard. In less than two minutes, he pointed out precisely where and why the lecturers' complex argument was contradictory, illogical, and unsupportable. The effect on the discussion leaders was devastating. After a confused silence, each attempted a weak reply only to halt midway to confer with his partner and finally to ad mit that my colleague's points were good ones \"requiring further study.\" More interesting to me, though, was the effect upon the rest of the audience. At the end of the question period, the two recruiters were faced with a crowd of audience members submitting their $75 down payments for admission to the TM program. Nudging, shrugging, and chuckling to one another as th ey took in the payments, the recruiters betrayed signs of giddy bewilderment. Af ter what appeared to have been an embarrassingly clear collapse of their presentation, the m eeting had somehow turned into a great success, genera ting mystifyingly high levels of compliance from the audience. Although more than a bit puzzled, I chalked up the audience response to a failure to understand the l ogic of my colleague's argumen ts. As it turned out, however, just the reverse was the case. Outside the lecture room after the meeting, we were approached by three members of the audience, each of whom had given a down payment immediately after the lecture. They wanted to know why we had come to the session. We explained, and we asked the same question of them. One was an aspiring actor who wanted desperately to succeed at his craft and had come to the meeting to l earn if TM would allow him to achieve the necessary self-control to master the art; the recruiters had assured him that it would. The second described herself as a severe inso mniac who hoped that TM would provide her with a way to relax and fall asleep easily at night. The third served as unofficial spokesman. He was failing his college courses, because there didn't seem to be enough time to study. He had come to the meeting to find out if TM could help by training him to need fewer hours of sleep each night; the additional time could then be used for study. It is interesting to note that the recruiters informed him as well as the insomniac that Transcendental Medita tion techniques could solve th eir respective, though opposite, problems. Still thinking that the three must have signed up because they hadn't understood the points made by my logician friend, I bega n to question them a bout aspects of his argument. To my surprise, I found that they had understood his comm ents quite well; in fact, all too well. It was preci sely the cogency of his argumen t that drove them to sign up for the program on the spot. The spokesman put it best: \"Well, I wasn't going to put down any money tonight because I'm really quite broke right now ; I was going to wait until the next meeting. But when your buddy star ted talking, I knew I'd better give them my money now, or I'd go home and star t thinking about what he said and never sign up.\" All at once, things began to make sense. These were people with real problems, and they were desperately searching for a way to solve those problems. They were seekers who, if our discussion leaders were to be believed, had found a potencial"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"59 Chapter 3 solution in TM. Driven by their needs, they very much wanted to believe that TM was their answer. Now, in the form of my colleague, intrude s the voice of reason, showing the theory underlying their newfound solution to be unsou nd. Panic! Something must be done at once before logic takes its toll and leaves them without hope once again. Quickly, quickly, walls against reason are needed; and it doesn't matter that the fortress to be erected is a foolish one. \"Qui ck, a hiding place from thought ! Here, take this money. Whew, safe in the nick of time. No need to think about the i ssues any longer.\" The decision has been made, and from now on the consistency tape can be played whenever necessary: 'TM? Certainly I think it will help me; certainly I expect to continue; certainly I believe in TM. I already put my money down for it, didn't I?\" Ah, the comforts of mindless consistency. \"I'll just rest right here for a while. It's so much nicer than the worry and strain of that hard, hard search.\" Seek and Hide If, as it appears, automatic consistency f unctions as a shield ag ainst thought, it should not be surprising that such c onsistency can also be explo ited by those who would prefer that we respond to their requests without thin king. For the profiteers, whose interest will be served by an unthinking, mechanical re action to their requests, our tendency for automatic consistency is a gold mine. So clever are they at arranging to have us play our consistency tapes when it profit s them that we seldom realiz e that we have been taken. In fine jujitsu fashion, they st ructure their interac tions with us so that our own need to be consistent leads directly to their benefit. Certain large toy manufacturer s use just such an approach to reduce a problem created by seasonal buying patterns. Of course, the boo m time for toy companies occurs before and during the Christmas holiday season. Their problem is that toy sales then go into a terrible slump for the next couple of months. Their cust omers have already spent the amount in their toy budgets and are stiffly re sistant to their child ren's pleas for more. So the toy manufacturers are faced with a dilemma: how to keep sales high during the peak season and, at the same time, retain a healthy demand for toys in the immediately following months. Their difficulty certainly doesn 't lie in motivating kids to want more toys after Christmas. The problem lies in motivating postholiday spent-out parents to buy another plaything for th eir already toy-glutted ch ildren. What could the toy companies possibly do to produce that unlik ely behavior? Some have tried greatly increased advertising campaigns, others have reduced prices during the slack period, but neither of those standard sales devices has proved successful. Both tactics are costly, and have been ineffective in increasing sales to desired leve ls. Parents are simply not in a toy-buying mood, and the influences of adve rtising or reduced e xpense are not enough to shake that stony resistance. Certain large toy manufacturers, however, think they have found a solution. It's an ingenious one, involving no more than a normal advertising expense and an un- "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Commitment and Consistency 60 derstanding of the powerful pull of the need for consistency. My first hint of the way the toy companies' strategy worked came after I fell for it and then, in true patsy form, fell for it again.It was January, and I was in the to wn's largest toy store. After purchasing all too many gifts there for my s on a month before, I had sworn not to enter that store or any like it for a long, long time. Yet there I wa s, not only in the diabolic place but also in the process of buying my son another expe nsive toy—a big, electri c road-race set. In front of the road-race displa y I happened to meet a form er neighbor who was buying his son the same toy. The odd thing was that we almost never saw each other anymore. In fact, the last time had been a year earlier in the same stor e when we were both buying our sons an expensive post-Christmas gift—t hat time a robot that walked, talked, and laid waste. We laughed about our strange pa ttern of seeing each other only once a year at the same time, in the same place, while doing the same thing. Later that day, I mentioned the coincidence to a friend who, it turned out, had once worked in the toy business. \"No coincidence,\" he said knowingly. \"What do you mean, 'No coincidence'?\" \"Look,\" he said, \"let me ask you a couple of questions about the road-race set you bought this year. First, did you promise your son that he'd get one for Christmas?\" \"Well, yes I did. Christopher had seen a bunch of ads for them on the Saturday morning cartoon shows and said that was what he wa nted for Christmas. I saw a couple of ads myself and it looked like fun; so I said OK.\" \"Strike one,\" he announced. \"Now for my second question. When you went to buy one, did you find all the stores sold out?\" \"That's right, I did! The stores said they'd ordered some but didn't know when they'd get any more in. So I had to buy Christopher some other toys to make up for the road-race set. But how did you know?\" \"Strike two,\" he said. \"Just let me ask one mo re question. Didn't this same sort of thing happen the year before with the robot toy?\" Wait a minute ... you're right. That's just what happened. This is incredible. How di d you know?\" No psychic powers; I just happen to know how several of the big t oy companies jack up their January and February sales. They start prior to Christma s with attractive TV ads for certain special toys. The kids, naturally, want what they s ee and extract Christmas promises for these items from their parents. Now here's where th e genius of the companies' plan comes in: They undersupply the stores with the toys they've go tten the parents to promise. Most parents find those toys sold out and are forced to substitute other toys of equal value. The toy manufacturers, of course, make a point of supplying the stores with plenty of these substitutes. Then, after Christmas, th e companies start running the ads again for the other, special toys. That juices up the ki ds to want those toys more than ever. They go running to their parents whining, 'You pr omised, you promised,' and the adults go trudging off to the store to live up dutifully to their words.\""},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"61 Chapter 3 \"Where,\" I said, beginning to seethe now, \"the y meet other parents they haven't seen for a year, falling for the same trick, right?\" \"Right. Uh, where are you going?\" \"I'm going to take the road-race set right back to the store.\" I was so angry I was nearly shouting. \"Wait. Think for a minute first. Why did you buy it this morning?\" \"Because I didn't want to let Christopher dow n and because I wanted to teach him that promises are to be lived up to.\" \"Well, has any of that changed? Look, if you take his toy away now, he won't understand why. He'll just know th at his father broke a promise to him. Is that what you want?\""},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Commitment and Consistency 62 \"No,\" I said, sighing, \"I guess not. So, you're telling me that the toy companies doubled their profits on me for the past two years, and I never ev en knew it; and now that I do, I'm still trapped—by my own words. So, what yo u're really telling me is, 'Strike three.' \" He nodded, \"And you're out.\" In the years since, I have obs erved a variety of parental to y-buying sprees similar to the one I experienced during that particular hol iday season—for Beanie Babies, Tickle Me Elmo dolls, Furbies, etc. But, historically, the one that best fits the pattern is that of the Cabbage Patch Kids, $25 dolls that were promoted heavily during mid-1980s Christmas seasons but were woefully unde rsupplied to stores. Some of the consequences were a government false advertising charge against the Kids' maker for continuing to advertise dolls that were not available; frenzied groups of adults battling at toy outlets or paying up to $700 apiece at auc tion for dolls they had promised their children; and an annual $150 million in sales that extended well beyond the Christmas months. During the 1998 holiday season, the least availa ble toy that everyone wanted was the Furby, created by a division of toy giant Hasbro. When asked wh at frustrated, Furby-less parents should tell their kids, a Hasbro spokeswoman advised th e kind of promise that has profited toy manufacturers for decades, \"I'll try, but if I can't get it for you now, I'll get it for you later\" (Tooher, 1998). COMMITMENT IS THE KEY Once we realize that the power of consistenc y is formidable in di recting human action, an important practical question immediately arises: How is that force engaged? What produces the click that activates the whirr of the powerful consistency tape? Social psychologists think they know the answer: commitment. If I can get you to make a commitment (that is, to take a stand, to go on record), I will have se t the stage for your automatic and ill-considered consistency with that earlier commitment. Once a stand is taken, there is a natural tendency to behave in ways that are stubbornly consistent with the stand. As we've already seen, social psychologi sts are not the only ones who understand the connection between commitment and consistency. Commitment strategies are aimed at us by compliance professionals of nearly every sort. Each of the strategies is intended to get us to take some action or make some statement that will trap us into later compliance through consistency pressures. Proc edures designed to create commitment take various forms. Some are bluntly strai ghtforward; others are among the most subtle compliance tactics we will encounter. On the blunt side, consider the approach of Jack Stanko, used-car sales manager for an Albuqu erque auto dealersh ip. While leading a session called \"Used Car Merchandising\" at a National Auto Dealers Association convention in San Francisco, he advised 100 sales-hungry dealers as follows: \"Put 'em on paper. Get the customer's OK on paper. Get the money up front. Control 'em. Control the deal. Ask 'em if they woul d buy the car right now if the price is right. Pin 'em down\" (Rubinstein, 1985). Obviously, Mr. Stanko—an expert "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"63 Chapter 3 in these matters—believes th at the way to customer compliance is through their commitments, thereby to \"control 'em\" for profit. Commitment practices involving su bstantially more finesse can be just as effective. For instance, suppose you wanted to increase the number of pe ople in your area who would agree to go door-to-door collecting donations for your favorite char ity. You would be wise to study the approach taken by social psychologist Steven J. Sherman. He simply called a sample of Bloomington, Indiana, resident s as part of a survey he was taking and asked them to predict what they would sa y if asked to spend three hours collecting money for the American Cancer Society. Of c ourse, not wanting to seem uncharitable to the survey-taker or to themselves, many of these people said that they would volunteer. The consequence of this subtle committmen t procedure was a 700 percent increase in volunteers when, a few days la ter, a representative of the American Cancer Society did call and ask for neighborhood canvassers (She rman, 1980). Using the same strategy, but this time asking citizens to predict whet her they would vote on election day, other researchers have been able to increase significan tly the turnout at the polls among those called (Greenwald, Carnot, Beach, & Y oung, 1987; Spangenberg & Greenwald, in press). Courtroom combatants appear to have adopted this practice of extracting a lofty initial commitment that is designed to spur future consistent behavior. When screening potential jurors before a trial, Jo-Ellen Dem itrius, the woman currently reputed to be the best consultant in the business of jury selection asks an ar tful question: \"If you were the only person who believed in my client's inno cence, could you withstand the pressure of the rest of the jury to change your mind?\" How could any self-respecting prospective juror say no? And, having made the promise, how could any self-respecting selected juror repudiate it later? Perhaps an even more crafty commitment technique has been developed by telephone solicitors for charity. Have you noticed that callers asking you to contribute to some cause or another these days seem to begin things by inquiring about your current health and well-being? \"Hello, Mr./Ms. Targetpers on,\" they say. \"How are you feeling this evening?,\" or \"How are you doing today?\" Th e caller's intent with this sort of introduction is not merely to seem friendly and caring. It is to get you to respond—as you normally do to such polite, superficial i nquiries—with a polite, superficial comment of your own: \"Just fine\" or \"Real good\" or \"I'm doing great, thanks.\" Once you have publicly stated that all is we ll, it becomes much easier for the solicitor to corner you into aiding those for whom all is not well: \"I'm glad to hear that, because I'm calling to ask if you'd be willing to make a donation to help out the unfortunate victims of...\" The theory behind this tactic is that peopl e who have just asserted that they are doing/feeling fine—even as a routine part of a sociable exchange—will consequently find it awkward to appear stingy in the context of their own admittedly favored circumstances. If all this sounds a bit far-f etched, consider the findings of consumer researcher Daniel Howard ( 1990), who put the theory to test. Residents of Dallas, Texas, were called on the phone and asked if they would agr ee to allow a representative of the Hunger Relief Committee to come to their homes to sell them cookies, the pr "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Commitment and Consistency 64 ceeds from which would be used to supply m eals for the needy. When tried alone, that request (labeled the standard solicita tion approach) produced only 18 percent agreement. However, if the caller initially asked, \"How are you feeling this evening?\" and waited for a reply before proceeding with the standard approach, several noteworthy things happened. Fi rst, of the 120 i ndividuals called, most (108) gave the customary favorable reply (\"Good,\" \"Fine,\" \"R eal well,\" etc.). Sec ond, 32 percent of the people who got the How-are-you- feeling-tonight question agr eed to receive the cookie seller at their homes, nearly twice the success rate of the standard solicitation approach. Third, true to the consistenc y principle, almost everyone (89 percent) w ho agreed to such a visit did in fact make a c ookie purchase when contacted at home. The question of what makes a commitment e ffective has numerous answers. A variety of factors affects the ability of a commitme nt to constrain our future behavior. One large-scale program designed to produce co mpliance illustrates how several of the factors work. The remarkable thing about th is program is that it was systematically employing these factors decades ago, well be fore scientific research had identified them. During the Korean War, many captured Am erican soldiers found themselves in prisoner-of-war camps run by the Chinese Co mmunists. It became clear early in the conflict that the Chinese treated captives quite differently than did their allies, the North Koreans, who favored harsh punishment to ga in compliance. Specifically avoiding the appearance of brutality, the Red Chinese enga ged in what they termed their \"lenient policy,\" which was, in reality, a concerted and sophisticated psyc hological assault on their captives. After the war, American psyc hologists questioned the returning prisoners intensively to determine what had occurred, in part because of the unsettling success of some aspects of the Chinese program. For exam ple, the Chinese were very effective in getting Americans to inform on one another, in striking contrast to the behavior of American POWs in World War II. For this reason, among others, escape plans were quickly uncovered and the escapes themselves almost always unsuccessful. \"When an escape did occur,\" wrote psychologist Edga r Schein (1956), a principal American investigator of the Chinese indoctrination program in Korea, \"the Chinese usually recovered the man easily by offering a bag of rice to anyone turni ng him in.\" In fact, nearly all American prisoners in the Chines e camps are said to have collaborated with the enemy in one way or another. 1 An examination of the prison-camp program sh ows that the Chinese relied heavily on commitment and consistency pressures to gain the desired compliance from their captives. Of course, the first problem facing the Chinese was to find a way to It is important to note that the collaborati on was not always intent ional. The American investigators defined co llaboration as \"any kind of be havior which helped the enmy,\" and it thus included such diverse activitie s as signing peace petitions, running errands, making radio appeals, accepting special favor s, making false confessions, informing on fellow prisoners, divulging military information, etc "},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"65 Chapter 3 get any collaboration at all from the Ameri cans. These prisoners had been trained to provide nothing but name, rank, and serial number. Short of physical brutalization, how could the captors hope to get such men to give military information, turn in fellow prisoners, or publicly denounce their country ? The Chinese answer was elementary: Start small and build. For instance, prisoners were frequently asked to make statements that were so mildly anti-American or pro-Communist that they seemed inconsequential (\"The United States is not perfect.\" \"In a Communist country, une mployment is not a problem.\"). Once these minor requests had been complied with, however, the men found themselves pushed to submit to related, yet more substantive, re quests. A man who had just agreed with his Chinese interrogator that the United States was not perfect might then be asked to indicate some of the ways in which he thought this was the case. Once he had so explained, he might be asked to make a list of these \"problems w ith America\" and to sign his name to it. Later he might be aske d to read his list in a discussion group with other prisoners. \"After all, it' s what you really believe, isn't it ?\" Still later, he might be asked to write an essay expanding on his lis t and discussing these problems in greater detail. The Chinese might then use his name and his essay in an anti-American radio broadcast beamed not only to the entire camp but to other POW camps in North Korea as well as to American forces in South Korea. Suddenl y he would find hims elf a \"collaborator,\" having given aid and comfort to the enemy. Aware that he had written the essay without any strong threats or coercion, many times a man would change his self-image to be consistent with the deed and with the new \"collaborator\" label, of ten resulting in even more extensive acts of colla boration. Thus, while \"only a few men were able to avoid collaboration altogether,\" according to Schei n, \"the majority collaborated at one time or another by doing things which seemed to th em trivial but which the Chinese were able to turn to their own advantage.... This was pa rticularly effective in eliciting confessions, self-criticism, and informati on during interrogation\" (1956)."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Commitment and Consistency 66 Other groups of people interest ed in compliance are also aware of the usefulness and power of this approach. Charitable orga nizations, for instance, will often use progressively escalating commitments to i nduce individuals to perform major favors. Research has shown that such trivial first commitments as agreeing to be interviewed can begin a \"momentum of compliance\" that induces such later behaviors as organ or bone marrow donations (Carducci, Deuser, Bauer, Large, & Ramaekers, 1989; Schwartz, 1970). Many business organizations employ this approach regularly as well. For the salesperson, the strategy is to obtain a large purchase by starting with a small one. Almost any small sale will do because the purpose of that small transaction is not profit, it is commitment. Further purchases, even mu ch larger ones, are expected to flow naturally from the commitment. An article in the trade magazine American Salesman put it succinctly: The general idea is to pave the way for full -line distribution by starting with a small order.... Look at it this way — when a person has signed an order for your merchandise, even though the profit is so small it hardl y compensates for the time and effort of making the call, he is no longer a prospect — he is a customer (Green, 1965, p. 14). The tactic of starting with a little request in order to gain eventual compliance with related larger requests has a name: the foot-i n-the-door technique. Soci al scientists first became aware of its effectiveness in 1966 when psychologists Jonathan Freedman and Scott Fraser published an ast onishing set of data. They reported the results of an experiment in which a researcher, posing as a volunteer worker, had gone door to door in a residential California neighborhood maki ng a preposterous request of homeowners. The homeowners were asked to allow a public-s ervice billboard to be installed on their front lawns. To get an idea of the way the sign would look, they were shown a photograph depicting an attractive house, th e view of which was almost completely obscured by a very large, poorly lettered sign read ing DRIVE CAREFULLY. Although the request was normally and understandabl y refused by the great majority of the residents in the area (only 17 percent complie d), one particular group of people reacted quite favorably. A full 76 percent of them offered the use of their front yards. The prime reason for their startling complia nce has to do with something that had happened to them about two weeks earlier: They had made a small commitment to driver safety. A different \"volunteer worker\" had come to their doors and asked them to accept and display a little three-inch-square sign that read BE A SAFE DRIVER. It was such a trifling request that nearly all of them had agreed to it, but the effects of that request were enormous. Because they had innocently complied with a trivial safe- driving request a couple of weeks before, these homeowners became remarkably willing to comply with another such request that was massive in size. Freedman and Fraser didn't stop there. They tried a slightly diffe rent procedure on another sample of homeowners. These pe ople first received a request to sign "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"67 Chapter 3 a petition that favored \"keeping California beau tiful.\" Of course, nearly everyone signed since state beauty, like efficiency in government or sound prenatal care, is one of those issues no one opposes. After waiting about two weeks, Freedman and Eraser sent a new \"volunteer worker\" to these same homes to ask the residents to allow the big DRIVE CAREFULLY sign to be erected on their lawn s. In some ways, the response of these homeowners was the most astounding of any in the study. Approximately half of these people consented to the inst allation of the DRIVE CAREFU LLY billboard, even though the small commitment they had made weeks earli er was not to driver safety but to an entirely different public-service topic, state beautification. At first, even Freedman and Eraser were bewildered by their findings. Why should the little act of signing a petiti on supporting state beautification cause people to be so willing to perform a different and much larger favor? After considering and discarding other explanations, Freedman and Fraser came upon one that offered a solution to the puzzle: Signing the beautif ication petition changed th e view these people had "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Commitment and Consistency 68 of themselves. They saw themselves as public -spirited citizens who acted on their civic principles. When, two weeks later, they were asked to perform anot her public service by displaying the DRIVE CAREFULLY sign, they co mplied in order to be consistent with their newly formed self-images. According to Freedman and Fraser: What may occur is a change in the person's feelings about getting involved or taking action. Once he has agreed to a request, his attitude may change, he may become, in his own eyes, the kind of person who does this so rt of thing, who agrees to requests made by strangers, who takes action on things he believes in, w ho cooperates with good causes, (p. 201) What the Freedman and Fraser findings tell us, then, is to be very careful about agreeing to trivial requests. Such an agreement can not only increase our compliance with very similar, much larger requests, it can also make us more willing to perform a variety of larger favors that are only remotely connected to the little one we did earlier. It's this second, general kind of influence concealed within small commitments that scares me. It scares me enough that I am rarely willing to sign a petition anymore, even for a position I support. Such an action has the pot ential to influence not only my future behavior but also my self-image in ways I may not want. Further, once a person's self- image is altered, all sorts of subtle advantages become av ailable to someone who wants to exploit that new image. Who among Freedman and Eraser's homeo wners would have thought that the \"volunteer worker\" who asked them to sign a state beautification petition was really interested in having them display a safe-driving billboard two weeks later? Who among them could have suspected that their decisi on to display the bi llboard was largely a result of signing the petition? No one, I'd guess. If there were any regrets after the billboard went up, who could they conceivably hold responsible but themselves and their own damnably strong civic spirits? Th ey probably never even considered the guy with the \"keeping California beautiful\" petition and all that knowledge of social jujitsu. Hearts and Minds Notice that all of the foot-in- the-door experts seem to be excited about the same thing: You can use small commitments to manipulat e a person's self-image; you can use them to turn citizens into \"public servants,\" pr ospects into \"customers,\" prisoners into \"collaborators.\" Once you've got a person's se lf-image where you want it, that person should comply naturally with a whole range of requests th at are consistent with this new self-view. Not all commitments affect self-image, ho wever. There are certain conditions that should be present for a commitment to be eff ective in this way: th ey should be active, public, effortful, and freely chosen. Th e major intent of the Chinese was not "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"69 Chapter 3 simply to extract information from their prisoners. It was to indoctrinate them, to change their attitudes and perceptions of th emselves, of their political system, of their country's role in the war, and of communi sm. Dr. Henry Segal, chief of the neuro- psychiatric evaluation team that examined returning POWs at the end of the Korean War, reported that war-related beliefs had b een substantially shifted. Significant inroads had been made in the political attitudes of the men: Many expressed antipathy towa rd the Chinese Communists but at the same time praised them for \"the fine job they had done in China.\" Others stated that \"although communism won't work in America, I think it 's a good thing for Asi a.\" (Segal, 1954, p. 360) _ It appears that the real goal of the Chinese was to modify, at least for a time, the hearts and minds of their captives. If we measur e their achievement in terms of \"defection, disloyalty, changed attitudes and beliefs , poor discipline, poor morale, poor esprit, and doubts as to America's role,\" Segal conclude d, \"their efforts were highly successful.\" Let's examine more closely how they managed it. The Magic Act Our best evidence of people's true feelings an d beliefs comes less from their words than from their deeds. Observers trying to decide what people are like look closely at their actions. Researchers have discovered that people themselves use this same evidence— their own behavior—to decide what they are like; it is a primary source of information about one's own beliefs, values, and att itudes (Bern, 1972; Vallacher & Wegner, 1985). The rippling impact of behavior on one's self-c oncept and future behavi or can be seen in research investigating the effect of ac tive versus passive commitments (Allison & Messick, 1988; Fazio, Sherman, & Herr, 1982) . For instance, in one study, college students volunteered for an AIDS education pr oject in the local schools. The researchers arranged for half to volunteer actively by filling out a form stating that they wanted to participate. The other ha lf volunteered passively by failing to fill out a form stating that they didn't want to participate. Three to four da ys later, when asked to begin their volunteer activity, the great majo rity (74 percent) who actua lly appeared for duty came from the ranks of those who had actively agr eed to participate. What's more, those who volunteered actively were more likely to explain their decisions by implicating their personal values, preferences, and traits (Cio ffi & Garner, 1996). In all, it seems that active commitments give us the kind of info rmation we use to shape self-image, which then shapes future actions, which solidify the new self-image. Understanding fully this route to altered self-per ception, the Chinese set about arranging the prison-camp experience so that their captives would consistently act in desired ways. Before long, the Chinese knew, these actions would begin to take "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Commitment and Consistency 70 their toll, causing the prisoners to change th eir views of themselves to align with what they had done. Writing was one sort of committing action that the Chinese urged incessantly upon the captives. It was never enough for prisoners to listen quietly or even to agree verbally with the Chinese line; they were always pushe d to write it down as well. Schein (1956) describes a standard i ndoctrination session tact ic of the Chinese: A further technique was to have the man write out the question and then the [pro- Communist] answer. If he refused to write it vo luntarily, he was asked to copy it from the notebooks, which must have seemed like a harmless enough concession, (p. 161) Oh, those \"harmless\" concessions. We'v e already seen how apparently trifling commitments can lead to further consiste nt behavior. As a commitment device, a written declaration has some gr eat advantages. First, it prov ides physical ev idence that an act has occurred. Once a prisoner wrot e what the Chinese wanted, it was very difficult for him to believe th at he had not done so. The o pportunities to forget or to deny to himself what he had done were not av ailable, as they were for purely verbal statements. No; there it was in his own handwriting, an irrevocably documented act driving him to make his beliefs and his se lf-image consistent with what he had undeniably done. Second, a writte n testament can be shown to other people. Of course, that means it can be used to persuade those people. It can persuade them to change their own attitudes in the direction of the statement. More importantly for the purpose of commitment, it can persuade them that the author genuinely believes what was written. People have a natural tendency to think that a statement reflects the true attitude of the person who made it. What is surp rising is that they continue to think so even when they know that the person did not freely choose to make the statement. Some scientific evidence that this is the case comes from a study by psychologists Edward Jones and James Harris (1967), who showed people an e ssay that was favorable to Fidel Castro and asked them to guess the true feelings of its author. Jones and Harris told some of these people that the author had chosen to write a pro-Castro essay; they told other people that the author had been required to write in favor of Castro. The strange thing was that even those people who knew that the author had been assigned to do a pro- Castro essay guessed that the writer liked Ca stro. It seems that a statement of belief produces a click, whirr response in those who view it. Unless there is strong evidence to the contrary, observers automatically assume that someone who makes such a statement means it (Allison, Mackie, Muller, & Worth, 1993). Think of the double-barreled effects on the se lf-image of a prisoner who wrote a pro- Chinese or anti-American statement. Not onl y was it a lasting pers onal reminder of his action, it was also likely to persuade those around him that it reflected his actual beliefs. As we will see in Chapter 4, what those around us think is true of us is enormously important in determining what we ourselves think is true. For "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"71 Chapter 3 example, one study found that one week afte r hearing that they were considered charitable people, homemakers in New Have n, Connecticut, gave much more money to a canvasser from the Multiple Sc lerosis Association (Kraut, 1973). Apparently the mere knowledge that someone viewed them as ch aritable caused these pe ople to make their actions consistent with that view. Savvy politicians have long used the committing character of labels to great advantage. One of the best at it was former president of Egypt, Anwar Sadat. Before international negotiations began, Sadat would assure hi s bargaining opponents that they and the citizens of their country were widely known for their cooperativeness and fairness. With this kind of flattery, he not only create d positive feelings, he also connected his opponent's identities to a course of action that served his goals. According to master- negotiator, Henry Kissinger (1982), Sadat was su ccessful because he got others to act in his interests by giving th em a reputation to uphold. Once an active commitment is made, then, se lf-image is squeezed from both sides by consistency pressures. From the inside, there is a pressure to bring self-image into line with action. From the outside, there is a sn eakier pressure—a tende ncy to adjust this image according to the way others perceive us (Schlenker, Dlugolecki, & Doherty, 1994). Because others see us as believing wh at we have written (even when we've had little choice in the matter), we once again expe rience a pull to bring self-image into line with the written statement. In Korea, several subtle devices were used to get prisoners to wr ite, without direct coercion, what the Chinese wanted. For exampl e, the Chinese knew that many prisoners were anxious to let their families know that they were alive. At the same time, the men knew that their captors were censoring the mail and that only some letters were being allowed out of camp. To ensure that their own letters should be released, some prisoners began including in their messages peace appeals, claims of kind treatment, and statements sympathetic to communism. The hope was that the Chinese would want such letters to surface and would, therefore, allow their delivery. Of course, the Chinese were happy to cooperate because thos e letters served th eir interests marvelously. First, their worldwide propaganda effort benefited great ly from the appearance of pro-Communist statements by American servicemen. Second, in the service of pr isoner indoctrination, the Chinese had, without rais ing a finger of physical for ce, gotten many men to go on record supporting the Communist cause. A similar technique involved political essay contests that were regularl y held in camp. The prizes for winning were invariably small—a few cigarettes or a bit of fruit— but were sufficiently scarce that they generated a lot of interest fr om the men. Usually the winning essay was one that took a solidly pro-Communist stand ... but not al ways. The Chinese were wise enough to realize that most of the pris oners would not enter a contest that they tho ught they could win only by writing a Communist tract. Moreov er, the Chinese were clever enough to know how to plant in the captives small co mmitments to communism that could be nurtured into later bloom. So, occasionally, the winning essay was one that generally supported the United States but that bowed once or twice to th e Chinese view. The effects of this strategy were exactly what the Chinese wanted. The men continued to participate voluntarily in the contests because"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Commitment and Consistency 72 they saw that they could win with essays hi ghly favorable to their own country. Perhaps without realizing it, however, they began to shade their es says a bit toward communism in order to have a better chance of winni ng. The Chinese were ready to pounce on any concession to Communist dogma and to bring consistency pressures to bear upon it. In the case of a written declaration with in a voluntary essay, they had a perfect commitment from which to build to ward collaboration and conversion. Other compliance professionals also know about the committing power of written statements. The enormously successful Amway Corporation, for instance, has a way to spur their sales personnel to greater and greater accomplishments. Members of the staff are asked to set individual sales goals and commit themselves to those goals by personally recording them on paper: One final tip before you get started: Set a goal and write it down. Whatever the goal, the important thing is that you set it, so you've got something for which to aim — and that you write it down. There is somethi ng magical about writing things down. So set a goal and write it down. When you reach that goal, set another and write that down. You'll be off and running. If the Amway people have found \"something magical about writing things down,\" so have other business organizations. Some doo r-to-door sales companies use the magic of written commitments to battle the \"cooling-off' laws that exist in many states. The laws are designed to allow customers a few days after agreeing to purchase an item to cancel the sale and receive a full ref und. At first this legislation hurt the hard-sell companies deeply. Because they emphasize high-pressure tactics, their customers often buy, not because they want the products but because they are duped or intimidated into the sale. When the laws went into effect, these customers began canceling in droves. The companies have since learned a beautifully simple trick that cuts the number of such cancellations drastically. They mere ly have the customer, rather than the salesperson, fill out the sales agreement. A ccording to the sales-training program of a prominent encyclopedia company, that persona l commitment alone has proved to be \"a very important psychological aid in preven ting customers from backing out of their contracts.\" Like the Amway Co rporation, these organizations have found that something special happens when people put their commitments on paper: They live up to what they have written down. Another common way for businesses to cash in on the \"magic\" of written declarations occurs through the use of an innocent-looki ng promotional device. Before I began to study weapons of social influence, I used to wonder why big companies such as Procter & Gamble and General Foods are always runni ng those \"25-, 50-, or 100-words or less\" testimonial contests. They all seem to be alike. A contestant is to compose a short personal statement that begins with the word s, \"I like the product because ...\" and goes on to laud the features of whatever cake mix or floor wax happens to be at issue. The company judges the entries and awards prizes to the winners. What puzzled me was what the companies got out of the deal. Often "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"73 Chapter 3 the contest requires no purchase; anyone su bmitting an entry is eligible. Yet, the companies appear to be willing to incu r the costs of contest after contest. I am no longer puzzled. The purpose behind the testimonial contest—to get as many people as possible to endorse a product—is the same as the purpose behind the political essay contests: to get endorsements for Chinese communism. In both instances the process is the same. Participants voluntarily wr ite essays for attractive prizes that they have only a small chance to win. They know th at for an essay to have any chance of winning at all, however, it must include praise for the product. So they search to find praiseworthy features of the product, and they describe them in their essays. The result is hundreds of POWs in Korea or hundreds of thousands of people in America who testify in writing to the products' appeal and who, consequently, experience that magical pull to believe what they have written. The Public Eye One reason that written test aments are effective in bringing about genuine personal change is that they can so easily be ma de public. The prisoner experience in Korea showed the Chinese to be quite aware of an important psychologica l principle: Public commitments tend to be lasting commitments. The Chinese constan tly arranged to have the pro-Communist statements of their captives seen by others. They were posted around camp, read by the author to a prisone r discussion group, or even read on the camp radio broadcast. As far as the Chinese were concerned, the more public the better. Why? Whenever one takes a stand that is visible to others, there arises a drive to maintain that stand in order to look like a consistent person (Tedeschi, Schlenker, & Bonoma, 1971; Schlenker et al., 1994). Remember that earlie r in this chapter I described how desirable good personal consistency is as a trait; how someone without it may be judged as fickle, uncertain, pliant, scatterbrained , or unstable; how someone with it is viewed as rational, assured, trustworthy, and sound. Given this contex t, it is hardly surprising that people try to avoid the look of inconsistency. For appearances' sake, then, the more public a stand, the more reluctant we will be to change it. An illustration of the way public commitments can lead to consistent further action was provided in a famous experiment performe d by two prominent social psychologists, Morton Deutsch and Harold Gerard (1955). The basic procedure was to have college students first estimate in their minds the lengt h of lines they were shown. At this point, one sample of the students had to commit them selves publicly to their initial judgments by writing their estimates down, signing their names to them, and turning them in to the experimenter. A second sample of students also committed themselves to their first estimates, but they did so privately by wr iting them down on a Magic Writing Pad and then erasing them by lifting the Magic Pad's plastic cover before anyone could see what they had written. A third set of students did not commit themselves to their initial estimates at all; they just kept the estimates in mind privately. In these ways, Deutsch and Ge rard had cleverly arranged fo r some students to commit themselves publicly, some privately, and some not at all, to their initial de-"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Commitment and Consistency 74 cisions. What Deutsch and Gerard wanted to find out was which of the three types of students would be most inclined to stick with their first judgments after receiving information that those judgments were incorr ect. Therefore, all the students were given new evidence suggesting that their initial estimates were wrong, and they were then given the chance to change their estimates. The results were quite clear. The student s who had never written down their first choices were the least loyal to those choi ces. When new evidence was presented that questioned the wisdom of decisions that had never left their heads, these students were the most influenced by the new information to change what they had viewed as the \"correct\" decision. Compared to these unc ommitted students, those who had merely written their decisions for a moment on a Ma gic Pad were significantly less willing to change their minds when given the chance. Even though they had committed themselves under anonymous circumstances , the act of writing down their first judgments caused them to resist the influen ce of contradictory new data and to remain consistent with their preliminary choices. However, Deutsch and Gerard found I that, by far, it was the students who had publicly recorded their in itial positions who most resolutely refused to shift from t hose positions later. Public commitments had hardened them into the most stubborn of all. This sort of stubbornness can oc cur even in situations in which accuracy should be more important than consistency. In one study, when 6- or 12-person experimental juries were deciding a close case, hung juries were significantly more fre quent if the jurors had to express their opinions w ith a visible show of hands ra ther than by secret ballot. Once jurors had stated their initial views publicly, they were reluctant to allow themselves to change publicly. Should you ever find yourself as the foreper-son of a jury under these conditions, you could reduce the risk of a hung jury by choosing a secret rather than public balloti ng technique (Kerr & MacCoun, 1985). The Deutsch and Gerard finding that we are tr uest to our decisions if we have bound ourselves to them publicly can be put to good use. Consider the organizations dedicated to helping people rid themselves of bad habits. Many weight-re duction clinics, for instance, understand that often a person's priv ate decision to lose weight will be too weak to withstand the blandishments of ba kery windows, wafting cooking scents, and late-night Sara Lee commercials. So they see to it that the decision is buttressed by the pillars of public commitment. They require their clients to write down an immediate weight-loss goal and show that goal to as many friends, relatives, and neighbors as possible. Clinic operators report that freque ntly this simple technique works where all else has failed. Of course, there's no need to pay a special clinic in order to engage a visible commitment as any ally. One San Diego woman described to me how she employed a public promise to help he rself finally stop smoking: / remember it was after I hear d about another scientific st udy showing that smoking causes cancer. Every time one of those things came out, I used to get determined to quit, but I never could. This time, though, I decided I had to do"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"75 Chapter 3 something. I'm a proud person. It matters to me if other people s ee me in a bad light. So I thought, \"Maybe I can me that pride to help me dump this damn habit.\" So I made a list of all the people who 1 really wanted to respect me. Then I went out and got some blank business cards and I wrot e on the back of each card, \"I promise you that I will never smoke another cigarette.\" Within a week, I had given or sent a signed card to everybody on my list — my dad, my brother back East, my boss, my best girlfriend, my ex-husband, everybody but one — the guy I was dating then. I was just crazy about him, and I really wanted him to value me as a person. Believe me, I though t twice about giving him a card because I knew that if I couldn't keep my promise to him I'd die. Bu t one day at the office—he worked in the same building as I did — I just walked up to him, handed him the card, and walked away without saying anything. Quitting \"cold turkey\" was the hardest thing I've ever done. There must have been a thousand times when I thought I had to have a smoke. But whenever that happened, I'd just picture how all the people on my list would think less of me if I couldn't stick to my guns. And that's all it took, I've never taken another puff. 2 READER'S REPORT 3.1 From a Canadian University Professor I just read a newspaper article on how a re staurant owner used public commitments to solve a big problem of customers who didn't sh ow-up for their table reservations. I don't know if he read your book or not first, but he did something that fits perfectly with the commitment/consistency principle you talk about. He told his receptionists to stop saying, \"Please call us if you change your pl ans,\" and to start asking, \"Will you please call us if you change your plans?\" and to wait for a response. His no-show rate immediately dropped from 30 percent to 10 percent. Author's note: What was it about this subtle sh ift that led to such a dramatic difference? For me, it was the receptionist's request for (and pause for) the caller's promise. By spurring patrons to make a public commitment, this approach increased the chance that they would follow through on it. By the way, the canny proprietor was Gordon Sinclair of Gordon's restaurant in Chicago. 2 This public commitment tactic may work especially well for individuals with high levels of pride or public self-consciousness (Feingstein, Scheier, & Buss, 1975). For example, it worked successfully for Charle s DeGaulle, whose remarkable achievements for France were said to be matched onl y by his ego. When asked to explain why announcing to everyone that he would stop his heavy smoking obliged him to quit forever, he is reported to have replied gravely, \"DeGau lle cannot go back on his word\" (Quoted in D. Cook, 1984). "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Commitment and Consistency 76 The Effort Extra The evidence is clear that the more effort th at goes into a commitment, the greater is its ability to influence the attitudes of the pers on who made it. We can find that evidence quite nearby or as far away as the back regions of the primitive world. Let's begin close to home with the entert ainment section of tomorrow's newspaper, where an important piece of information is missing from ads for popular music concerts—the price. Why should it be that concert promoters are increasingly hiding the cost of admission from fans? Perhaps they're afraid that their ever-higher prices will scare ticket buyers away. But, in terested fans will find out the price of a seat as soon as they call or visit a ticket outlet, right? True, but pr omoters have recognized that potential concertgoers are more likely to buy tickets after that call or visit than before. Even phoning to inquire about ticket prices constitutes an initial commitment to the concert. Combine that with the time and effort expended waiting interminably on hold after speed-rediali ng through jammed phone lines, and the promoters have fans precisely where they want them once the co st is revealed—at the end of an active, public, effortful commitment to the event. More far-flung illustrations of the power of effortful commitments exist, as well. There is a tribe in southern Africa, the Thonga, th at requires each of its boys to go through an elaborate initiation cere mony before he can be counted a man of the tribe. As with boys in many other primitive tribes, a Thonga boy endur es a great deal before he is admitted to adult membership in the group. Anthropologists Whiting, Kluckhohn, and Anthony (1958) have described this three-mont h ordeal in brief but vivid terms: When a boy is somewhere between 10 and 16 years of age, he is sent by his parents to \"circumcision school,\" which is held every 4 or 5 years. Here in company with his age- mates he undergoes severe hazing by the adult males of the society. The initiation begins when each boy runs the gauntlet between two rows of men who beat him with clubs. At the end of this experie nce he is stripped of his clothes and his hair is cut. He is next met by a man covered w ith lion manes and is seated upo n a stone facing this \"lion man.\" Someone then strikes him from behind and when he turns his head to see who has struck him, his foreskin is seized and in two movements cut off by the \"lion man.\" Afterward he is secluded for three months in the \"yard of mysteries,\" where he can be seen only by the initiated. During the course of his initiation, the boy undergoes six major trials: beatings, exposure to cold, thirst, eating of unsavory foods, punishment, and th e threat of death. On the slightest pretext, he may be beaten by one of the newly initiated men, who is assigned to the task by the older men of the tribe. He sleeps without covering and suffers bitterly from the winter cold. He is forbidden to drink a dr op of water during the whole three months. Meals are often made nauseating by the half-digested grass from the stomach of an antelope, which is poured over his food. If he is caught "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"77 Chapter 3 breaking any important rule governing the ceremony, he is se verely punished. For example, in one of these punishments, sti cks are placed between the fingers of the offender, then a strong m an closes his hand around that of the novice, practically crushing his fingers. He is frightened into s ubmission by being told that informer times boys who had tried to escape or who had r evealed the secrets to women or to the uninitiated were hanged and their bodi es burned to ashes, (p. 360) On the face of it, these rites seem extraordinary and bizarre. Yet, at the same time, they are remarkably similar in principle and even in detail to the common initiation ceremonies of school fraternities. During the traditional \"Hell Week\" held yearly on college campuses, fraternity pledges must persevere through a va riety of activities designed by the older members to test the limits of physi cal exertion, psychological strain, and social embarrassment. At week's end, the boys who have persisted through the ordeal are accepted for full group membersh ip. Mostly their tribulations have left them no more than greatly tired and a bit shaky, although sometimes the negative effects are more serious. What is interesting is how cl osely the particular features of Hell Week tasks match those of tribal initiation rites. R ecall that anthropologists identi fied six major trials to be endured by a Thonga initiate during his stay in the \"yard of mysteries.\" A scan of newspaper reports shows that e ach trial also has its place in the hazing rituals of Greek- letter societies: • Beatings. Fourteen-year-old Michael Kalogris spent three weeks in a Long Island hospital recovering from internal injuries suffered during a Hell Night initiation ceremony of his high-school fraternity , Omega Gamma Delta. He had been administered the \"atomic bomb\" by his prospe ctive brothers, who told him to hold his hands over his head and keep them there whil e they gathered around to slam fists into his stomach and back simultaneously and repeatedly. • Exposure to cold. On a winter night, Frederick Br onner, a California junior college student, was taken 3,000 feet up and 10 miles in to the hills of a national forest by his prospective fraternity brothers. Left to find his way home wear ing only a thin sweat shirt and slacks, Fat Freddy, as he was called, shivered in a frigid wind until he tumbled down a steep ravine, fracturing bones and hur ting his head. Prevented by his injuries from going on, he huddled there against th e cold until he died of exposure. • Thirst. Two Ohio State University freshmen found themselves in the \"dungeon\" of their prospective fraternity house after break ing the rule requiring all pledges to crawl into the dining area prior to Hell Week meal s. Once locked in the house storage closet, they were given only salty f oods to eat for nearly two da ys. Nothing was provided for drinking purposes except a pa ir of plastic cups in whic h they could catch their own urine. "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Commitment and Consistency 78 "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"79 Chapter 3 • Eating of unsavory foods. At Kappa Sigma house on the campus of the University of Southern California, the eyes of eleven pledges bulged when they saw the sickening task before them. Eleven quarter-pound slab s of raw liver lay on a tray. Thick cut and soaked in oil, each was to be swallowed whole, one to a boy. Gagging and choking repeatedly, young Richard Swans on failed three times to down his piece. Determined to succeed, he finally got the oil-soaked meat in to his throat where it lodged and, despite all efforts to remove it, killed him. • Punishment. In Wisconsin, a pledge who forgot one section of a ritual incantation to be memorized by all initiates was punished fo r his error. He was required to keep his feet under the rear legs of a folding chair while the heaviest of his fraternity brothers sat down and drank a beer. Although the pledge did not cry out during the punishment, a bone in each of his feet was broken. • Threats of death. A pledge of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity was taken to a beach area of New Jersey and told to dig his \"own grave. \" Seconds after he complied with orders to lie flat in the finished hole, the sides co llapsed, suffocating him before his prospective fraternity brothers could dig him out. There is another striking similarity between the initiation rites of tribal and fraternal societies: They simply will not die. Resisti ng all attempts to elim inate or suppress them, such hazing practices have been phenomena lly resilient. Authorities, in the form of colonial governments or univers ity administrations, have tried threats, social pressures, legal actions, banishments, br ibes, and bans to persuade groups to remove the hazards and humiliations from their initiation ceremonies. None has been successful. Oh, there may be a change while the authority is wa tching closely, but this is usually more apparent than real—the harsher trials occu rring under more secret circumstances until the pressure is off when they can surface again. On some college campuses, officials have tr ied to eliminate dangerous hazing practices by substituting a \"Help Week\" of civic serv ice or by taking dire ct control of the initiation rituals. When such attempts are no t slyly circumvented by fraternities, they are met with outright physical resistance. For example, in the aftermath of Richard Swanson's choking death at USC, the univers ity president issued new rules requiring that all pledging activities be reviewed by sc hool authorities before going into effect and that adult advisers be present during in itiation ceremonies. According to one national magazine, \"the new 'code' set off a riot so violent that city police and fire detachments were afraid to enter campus.\" Resigning themselves to the inevitable, othe r college representatives have given up on the possibility of abolishing the degradations of Hell Week. \"If hazing is a universal human activity, and every bit of evidence po ints to this conclusion, you most likely won't be able to ban it effectively. Refuse to allow it openly and it will go underground. You can't ban sex, you can't prohibit alcohol , and you probably can't eliminate hazing!\" (Gordon & Gordon, 1963). What is it about hazing practices that make them so precious to these societies? What could make the groups want to evade, unde rmine, or contest any effort to ban"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Commitment and Consistency 80 the degrading and perilo us features of their initiation ri ghts? Some have argued that the groups themselves are composed of psychologi cal or social miscreants whose twisted needs demand that others be harmed and humiliated. The evidence, however, does not support such a view. Studies done on the persona lity traits of fraternity members, for instance, show them to be, if anything, slightly healthier th an other college students in their psychological adjustment (for a re view, see C. S. Johnson, 1972). Similarly, fraternities are known for their willingness to engage in beneficial community projects for the general social good. What they are not willing to do, however, is substitute these projects for their initiation ceremonies. One survey at the University of Washington (Walker, 1967) found that, of the fraternity ch apters examined, most had a type of Help Week tradition but that th is community service was in addition to Hell Week. In only one case was such service directly related to initiation procedures. The picture that emerges of the perpetrators of hazing practices is of normal individuals who tend to be psychologically stable a nd socially concerned but who become aberrantly harsh as a group at only one time—immediately before the admission of new members to the society. The evidence, then, poi nts to the ceremony as the culprit. There must be something about its rigors that is vital to the group. There must be some function to its harshness that the society wi ll fight relentlessly to maintain. What? My own view is that the answer appeared in 1959 in the results of a study little known outside of social psychology. A pair of young researchers, Elliot Aronson and Judson Mills, decided to test their observation that \"persons who go through a great deal of trouble or pain to atta in something tend to value it more highly than persons who attain the same thing with a minimum of effort.\" Th e real stroke of insp iration came in their choice of the initiation ceremony as the best place to examine this possibility. They found that college women who had to e ndure a severely em barrassing initiation ceremony in order to gain access to a sex discussion group convinced themselves that their new group and its discussions were ex tremely valuable, even though Aronson and Mills had rehearsed the other group members to be as \"worth less and uninteresting\" as possible. Different coeds who went through a much milder initiation ceremony or went through no initiation at all, were decidedl y less positive about the \"worthless\" new group they had joined. Additional research sh owed the same results when coeds were required to endure pain rather than emba rrassment to get into a group (Gerard & Mathewson, 1966). The more electric shock a woman received as part of the initiation ceremony, the more she later persuaded hers elf that her new group and its activities were interesting, intel ligent, and desirable. Now the harassments, the exertions, even the b eatings of initiation r ituals begin to make sense. The Thonga tribesman with tears in his eyes, watching his 10-year-old son tremble through a night on the cold ground of the \"yard of mysteries,\" the college sophomore punctuating his Hell Night paddling of his fraternity \"li ttle brother\" with bursts of nervous laughter, these are not acts of sadism. They are acts of group survival. They function, oddly enough, to spur future society members to find the "},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"81 Chapter 3 group more attractive and worthwhile. As long as it is the case that people like and believe in what they have struggled to get, these groups will continue to arrange effortful and troublesome initiation rites. The loyalty and dedication of those who emerge will increase to a great degree the chances of gr oup cohesiveness and survival. Indeed, one study of 54 tribal cultures f ound that those with the most dramatic and stringent initiation ce remonies were those with the greatest group solidarity (Young, 1965). Given Aronson and Mills' demonstrati on that the severity of an initiation ceremony significantly heightens the newcomer's commitment to the group, it is hardly surprising that groups will oppose all attempts to eliminate this crucial link to their future strength. Military groups and organizations are by no me ans exempt from these same processes. The agonies of \"boot camp\" initiations to the armed services are legendary and effective. The novelist William Styron testified to this effectiveness after recounting the misery of his own U.S. Marine concen tration-camp-like \"training nightmare:\" There is no ex-Marine of my acquaintance . . . who does not view the training as a crucible out of which he emerged in some way more resilient, simply braver and better for the wear (Styron, 1977, p. 3). Although the rigors of basic training are wide ly approved by military brass, a policy of \"zero tolerance\" is said to exist for inci dents of aberrantly harsh hazing like those contained in two videotapes uncovered by TV news sources in 1997. The tapes depicted the practice of \"blood pinning,\" in which ma rine paratroopers who have completed 10 training jumps receive their golden wing pins. The pins, each with a pair of half-inch points protruding from the bac k, are affixed to an initiate 's shirt and then ground, punched, slammed, and slapped into his chest while he writhes and screams (Gleick, 1997). Despite claims of outrage and disgust fr om military leaders in the aftermath, only one of the 30 marines caught perpetrating th e pain was recommende d for discharge. A few were assigned to receive counseling, wh ile the participation of most (20) was simply ignored. Official pronouncements of \" zero tolerance\" notwithstanding, I find it instructive that the slap s delivered to the ini tiates were thunderous an d to the heart. But, to the initiators, they were light and to th e wrist. Once again, it appears that, for groups concerned about fostering a lasting sense of solidarity and distinct ion, the hardship of demanding initiation activities wi ll not be easily undermined. The Inner Choice Examination of such diverse activities as the indoctrination pract ices of the Chinese Communists and the initiation rituals of colle ge fraternities provi des some valuable information about commitment. It appears that the commitments most effective in changing a person's self-image and future beha vior are those that are active, public, and "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Commitment and Consistency 82 effortful. However, there is another propert y of effective commitment more important than the other three combined. To understand what it is, we first need to solve a pair of puzzles in the actions of Co mmunist interrogators and co llege fraternity brothers. The first puzzle comes from the refusal of fraternity chapters to allow public-service activities to be part of thei r initiation ceremonies. Recall Walker's survey (1967), which reported that community projects, though fre quent, were nearly al ways separated from the membership-induction program. Why? If an effortful commitment is what fraternities are after in th eir initiation rites, surely they could structure enough distasteful and strenuous civic act ivities for their pledges; ther e is plenty of exertion and unpleasantness to be found in the world of old-age-home repairs, mental-health-center yard work, and hospital bedpan duty. Besides, community-spirited endeavors of this sort would do much to improve the highly unfavorable public and media image of fraternity Hell Week rites; a survey (Pha len, 1951) showed that for every positive newspaper story concerning He ll Week, there were five ne gative stories. If only for public-relations reasons, then, fraternities should want to incorporate community- service efforts into their initiation practices. But they don't. To examine the second puzzle, we need to return to the Chinese prison camps of Korea and the political essay contests held for American captives. The Chinese wanted as many Americans as possible to enter these contests so that, in the process, they might write comments favorable to the Communist view. If, however, the idea was to attract large numbers of entrants, why were the priz es so small? A few extra cigarettes or a little fresh fruit were often al l that a contest winner could expect. In the setting, even these prizes were valuable, but, still, ther e were much larger rewards—warm clothing, special mail privileges, increased freedom of movement in camp—that the Chinese could have used to increase th e number of essay writers. Yet they specifically chose to employ the smaller rather than the larger, more motivating rewards. Although the settings are quite different, the su rveyed fraternities refused to allow civic activities into their initiation ceremonies fo r the same reason that the Chinese withheld large prizes in favor of le ss powerful inducements: They wanted the participants to own what they had done. No excuses, no ways out were allowed. A pledge who suffered through an arduous hazing could not be given the chance to believe he did so for charitable purposes. A prisoner who salted his political essay with ami-American comments could not be permitted to shrug it off as motivated by a big reward. No, the fraternity chapters and Chinese Communists were playing for keeps. It was not enough to wring commitments out of their men; t hose men had to be made to take inner responsibility for their actions. Given the Chinese Communist government's affi nity for the political essay contest as a commitment device, it should come as no surpri se that a wave of such contests appeared in the aftermath of the 1989 massacre in Tiannanmen Square, where pro-democracy protesters were gunned down by government sold iers. In Beijing al one, nine state-run newspapers and television stations sponsored essay competitions on the \"quelling of the counterrevolutionary rebell ion.\" Still acting in accord "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"83 Chapter 3 with its long-standing and in sightful de-emphasis of rewa rds for public commitments, the Beijing government left th e contest prizes unspecified. Social scientists have determined that we accept inner responsibility for a behavior when we think we have chosen to perform it in the absence of strong outside pressure. A large reward is one such external pressure. It may get us to perf orm certain actions, but it won't get us to accept inner responsibility for the acts. 3 Consequently, we won't feel committed to them. The same is true of a strong threat; it may motivate immediate compliance, but it is unlikely to produce l ong-term commitment. All this has important implications for rearing children. It suggest s that we should never heavily bribe or threaten our children to do the things we want them truly to believe in. Such pressures will probably produce temporary compliance w ith our wishes. However, if we want more than just that, if we want our children to believe in the correctness of what they have done, if we want them to continue to perform the desired behavior when we are not present to apply those outsi de pressures, then we must somehow arrange for them to accept inner responsibility for the actions we want them to take. An experiment by Jonathan Freedman (1965) gives us some hint s about what to do and what not to do in this regard. Freedman wanted to see if he could preven t second-to-fourth-grade boys from playing with a fascinating toy, just because he had said that it was wrong to do so some six weeks earlier. Anyone familiar with seven- to nine-year-old boys must realize the enormity of the task, but Freedman had a pla n. If he could first get the boys to convince themselves that it was wrong to play with th e forbidden toy, perhap s that belief would keep them from playing with it thereafter. The difficulty was making the boys believe that it was wrong to amuse themselves with the toy—an extremely expensive, battery- controlled robot. Freedman knew it would be easy enough to ha ve a boy obey temporarily. All he had to do was threaten the boy with severe consequences should he be caught playing with the toy. As long as he was nearby to deal out stiff punishment, Freedm an figured that few boys would risk operating the robot. He was right. After showing a boy an array of five toys and warning him, \"It is wr ong to play with th e robot. If you play with the robot, I'll be very angry and will have to do somethi ng about it,\" Freedman left the room for a few minutes. During that time, the boy was obs erved secretly through a one-way mirror. Freedman tried this threat procedure on 22 di fferent boys, and 21 of them never touched the robot while he was gone. So a strong threat was su ccessful while the boys thought they might be caught and punished. Of course, Freedman had already guessed that. He was really interested in the effectiveness of the th reat in guiding the boys' behavior later on, when he was no longer around. To find out what would happen then, he sent a young sin fact large material rewards may even re duce or \"undermine\" our inner responsibility for an act, causing a subseque nt reluctance to perform it when the reward is no longer present (Deci & Ryan, 1985; Higgins, Lee, Kwon, & Trope, 1995; Lepper & Greene, 1978)."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Commitment and Consistency 84 woman back to the boys' school about six week s after he had been there. She took the boys out of the class one at a time to pa rticipate in an experiment. Without ever mentioning any connection with Freedman, she escorted each boy back to the room containing the five toys and ga ve him a drawing test. While she was scoring the test, she told the boy that he was free to play with a ny toy in the room. Of course, almost all of the boys played with a toy. The interesting re sult was that, of the boys who played with a toy, 77 percent chose to play with the robot that had been forbidden to them earlier. Freedman's severe threat, which had been so successful six weeks before, was almost totally unsuccessful when he was no longe r able to back it up with punishment. However, Freedman wasn't finished yet. He changed his procedure slightly with a second sample of boys. These boys, too, were in itially shown the array of five toys by Freedman and warned not to pl ay with the robot while he was briefly out of the room because \"It is wrong to play with the robot.\" This time, Freedman provided no strong threat to frighten a boy into obedience. He simply left the room and observed through the one-way mirror to see if his instruction against playing with the forbidden toy was enough. It was. Just as with the other sample, only 1 of the 22 boys touc hed the robot during the short time Freedman was gone. The real difference between the two samples of boys came six weeks later, when they had a chance to play with the toys while Freed man was no longer around. An astonishing thing happened w ith the boys who earlier had been given no strong threat against playing with the robot: When given the freedom to play with any toy they wished, most avoided the robot, even though it was by far the most a ttractive of the five toys available (the others were a cheap plastic submarine, a child's baseball glove without a ball, an unloaded toy rifle, and a toy tractor). When these boys played with one of the five toys, only 33 percent chose the robot. Something dramatic had happe ned to both groups of boys. Fo r the first group, it was the severe threat they heard from Freedman to back up his statement that playing with the robot was \"wrong.\" It had been quite effective, while Freedman could catch them violating his rule. Later, though, when he wa s no longer present to observe the boys' behavior, his threat was impotent and his rule was, consequently, ignored. It seems clear that the threat had not taught the boys th at operating the robot was wrong, only that it was unwise to do so when the possibility of punishment existed. For the other boys, the dramatic event had co me from inside, not outside. Freedman had instructed them, too, that pl aying with the robot was wrong, but he had added no threat of punishment should they disobey him. Th ere were two important results. First, Freedman's instruction alone was enough to prevent the boys from operating the robot while he was briefly out of the room. S econd, the boys took persona l responsibility for their choices to stay away from the robot dur ing that time. They d ecided that they hadn't played with it because they didn't want to. After all, th ere were no strong punishments associated with the toy to e xplain their behavior otherwis e. Thus, weeks later, when Freedman was nowhere around, they still ignored the "},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"85 Chapter 3 robot because they had been changed inside to believe that they did not want to play with it. Adults facing the child-rear ing experience can take a cu e from the Freedman study. Suppose a couple wants to impress upon thei r daughter that lying is wrong. A strong, clear threat (\"It's bad to lie, honey, so if I catch you at it, I'll cut your tongue out\") might well be effective when the parents are pres ent or when the girl thinks she can be discovered. However, it will not achieve the la rger goal of convincing her that she does not want to lie because she thinks it's wrong. To do that, a much subtler approach is required. A reason must be given that is just strong enough to get her to be truthful most of the time but is not so strong that she sees it as the obvious reason for her truthfulness. It's a tricky business because this barely sufficient reason changes from child to child. For one child, a simple appeal may be e nough (\"It's bad to lie, honey, so I hope you won't do it\"); for another, it may be necessary to add a somewhat st ronger reason (\" ... because if you do, I'll be disappointed in you\"); for a third child, a mild form of warning may be required as well (\" . .. and I'll pr obably have to do something I don't want to do\"). Wise parents will know which kind of reason will work on their own children. The important thing is to use a r eason that will initially produ ce the desired behavior and will, at the same time, allow a child to take personal responsibility for that behavior. Thus, the less detectable outside pressure such a reason co ntains, the better. Selecting just the right reason is not an easy task for parents, but the effort should pay off. It is likely to mean the difference between short-lived complia nce and long-term commitment. As Samuel Butler wrote more than 300 years ago, \"He who agrees against his will / Is of the same opinion still.\" Growing Legs to Stand On For a pair of reasons we have already ta lked about, compliance professionals love commitments that produce inner change. First, that change is not just specific to the situation where it first occurred; it covers a whole range of rela ted situations, too. Second, the effects of the change are lasting. So, once people have been induced to take actions that shift their self-images to that of, let's say, public-spiri ted citizens, they are likely to be public-spirited in a variety of other circumstances where their compliance may also be desired. And they are likely to continue their pu blic-spirited behavior for as long as their new self-images hold. There is yet another attraction in commitmen ts that lead to inner change—they \"grow their own legs.\" There is no need for the compliance professional to undertake a costly and continuing effort to reinforce the change ; the pressure for consistency will take care of all that. After people come to view themselves as public -spirited citizens, they will automatically begin to see things differently. They will convince themselves that it is the correct way to be and will begin to pay a ttention to facts they hadn't noticed before about the value of community serv ice. They will make themselves "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Commitment and Consistency 86 available to hear arguments they hadn't hear d before favoring civic action and will find such arguments more persuasive than before. In general, because of the need to be consistent within their system of beliefs, they will assure themselves that their choice to take public-spirited action was right. What is important about this process of generating additional reasons to justify the co mmitment is that the reasons are new. Thus, even if the original reason for the civic-minded behavior were taken away, these newly discovered reasons alone might be enough to support their pe rceptions that they had behaved correctly. The advantage to an unscrupulous complian ce professional is tremendous. Because we build new struts to undergird choices we have committed ourselves to, an exploitative individual can offer us an inducement for ma king such a choice. After the decision has been made, the individual can remove that inducement, knowing th at our decision will probably stand on its own newly created legs. Car dealers frequently try to benefit from this process through a trick they call \"throwing a low-ball.\" I first encountered the tactic while posing as a sales trainee at a local Ch evrolet dealership. After a week of basic instruction, I was allowed to watch the regul ar salespeople perform. One practice that caught my attention right away was the low-ball. For certain customers, a very good price, perhaps as much as $400 below competitors' prices, is offered on a car. Th e good deal, however, is not genuine; the dealer never intends it to go through. Its only purpose is to cause prospects to decide to buy one of the dealership's cars. Once the decision is made, a number of activities develop the customer's sense of personal commitment to the car—a fistful of purchase forms are filled out, extensive financing terms are arranged, sometimes the customer is encouraged to drive the car for a day befo re signing the contract, \"so you can get the feel of it and show it around the neighborhood and at work.\" During this time, the dealer knows, customers typically develop a range of new reasons to support their choice and to justify the investments they have now made (Brockner & Rubin, 1985; Teger, 1980). Then something happens. Occasionally an \"err or\" in the calculations is discovered— maybe the salesperson forgot to add the cost of the air conditioner, and if the buyer still requires air-conditioning, $400 must be added to the price. To throw suspicion off themselves, some dealers let the bank handlin g the financing find the mistake. At other times, the deal is disallowed at the last mo ment; the salesperson checks with his or her boss, who cancels it because \"the dealership would be losing money.\" For only another $400 the car can be had, which, in the cont ext of a multithousand-dol-lar deal, doesn't seem too steep since, as the salesperson em phasizes, the cost is equal to competitors' and \"This is the car you chose, right?\" Another, even more insidious form of lo w-balling occurs when the salesperson makes an inflated trade-in offer on the prospect's old car as part of the buy/trade package. The customer recognizes the offer as overly genero us and jumps at the deal. Later, before the contract is signed, the used-car manager says that the salesperson's "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"87 Chapter 3 estimate was $400 too high and re duces the trade-in allowanc e to its actual, blue-book level. The customer, realizing that the re duced offer is the fair one, accepts it as appropriate and sometimes feels guilty about trying to take advantage of the salesperson's high estimate. I once witnesse d a woman provide an embarrassed apology to a salesman who had used the last versi on of low-balling on he r—this while she was signing a new-car contract giving him a huge commission. He looked hurt but managed a forgiving smile. No matter which variety of low-balling is us ed, the sequence is the same: An advantage is offered that induces a fa vorable purchase decision. The n, sometime after the decision has been made, but before the bargain is sealed, the original purchase advantage is deftly removed. It seems almost incredible that a customer would buy a car under these circumstances. Yet it works—not on everybody, of course, but it is effective enough to be a staple compliance procedure in many car showrooms. Automobile dealers have come to understand the ability of a pe rsonal commitment to build its own support system, a support system of new justific ations for the commitment. Often these justifications provide so many strong legs fo r the decision to stand on that when the dealer pulls away only one le g, the original one, there is no collapse. The loss can be shrugged off by the customer who is consol ed, even made happy, by the array of other good reasons favoring the choice. It never oc curs to the buyer th at those additional reasons might never have existed had the c hoice not been made in the first place. After watching the low-ball technique work so impressively in the car showroom, I decided to test its effectiveness in another setting where I could see if the basic idea worked with a bit of a twist. That is, the car salespeople I observ ed threw the low-ball by proposing sweet deals, getting favorable deci sions as a result, and then taking away the sweet part of the offers. If my thinki ng about the essence of the low-ball procedure was correct, I recognized that I should be able to get the tactic to work in a somewhat different way: I could offer a good deal, wh ich would produce the crucial decisional commitment, and then I could add an un pleasant feature to the arrangement. Because the effect of the low-ball technique was to get an individual to stick with a deal, even after circumstances had change d to make it a poor one, the tactic should work whether a positive aspect of the deal was removed or a negative aspect was added. So, to test this latter possibility, my colleagues J ohn Cacioppo, Rod Bassett, John Miller, and I ran an experi ment designed to get Introduc tory Psychology students at Ohio State University to agree to perform an unpleasant activity: to wake up very early to participate in a 7:00 A.M. study \"on thinki ng processes.\" When calling one sample of students, we immediately informed them of the 7:00 A.M. starting time. Only 24 percent were willing to participate. However, when calling a second sample of students, we threw a low-ball: We first asked if they wanted to participate in a study of thinking processes, and after they responded—56 per cent of them positively—we mentioned the 7:00 A.M. start time and gave them the chance to change their minds. None of them did. What's more, in keeping with their commitment to "},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Commitment and Consistency 88 participate, 95 percent of the low-balled st udents did come to the Psychology Building at 7:00 A.M. as promised. I know this to be the case because I recruited two research assistants to be on site at that time to conduct the thinking proce sses experiment and to take the names of the students who appeared. 4 The impressive thing about the low-ball tactic is its ability to make a person feel pleased with a poor choice. Those who have only poor choices to offe r us are especi ally fond of the technique. We can find them throwing lo w-balls in business, social, and personal situations. For instance, there's my neighbor Tim, a true low-ball aficionado. Recall that he's the one who, by promising to change his ways, got his girlfriend, Sara, to cancel her impending marriage to another and take him back. Since her decision to choose Tim, Sara has become more devoted to him than ever, even though he has not fulfilled his promises. She explains this by saying that sh e has allowed herself to see all sorts of positive qualities in Tim she ha d never recognized before. I know full well that Sara is a low-ball victim. Just as I ha d watched buyers fall for the give-it-and-take-it-away-later strategy in the car showroom, I watched her fall for the same trick with Tim. For his part, Tim rema ins the guy he has always been. Because the new attractions Sara has discovered (or create d) in him are quite real for her, she now seems satisfied with the same arrangement that was unacceptable before her enormous commitment. The decision to choose Tim, poor as it may have been objectively, has grown its own supports and appears to have made Sara genuinely happy. I have never mentioned to Sara what I know about low-ball ing. The reason for my silence is not that I think her better off in the dark on the i ssue. As a general guiding principle, more information is always better than less informa tion. It's just that, if I said a word, I am confident she would hate me for it. Standing Up for the Public Good Depending on the motives of the person wish ing to use them, any of the compliance techniques discussed in this book can be em ployed for good or for ill. It should not be surprising, then, that the low-ball tactic can be used for more socially beneficial purposes than selling new cars or reestablishi ng relationships with former lovers. One research project done in Iowa (Pallak, Cook, & Sullivan, 1980), for example, There is no foundation to the rumor that, in recruiting my research assistants for this task, I first asked if they wanted to admi nister a study on thinking processes and, after they agreed, informed them of the 7:00 A.M. starting time. In addition to the just-describ ed study, several other experi ments have attested to the effectiveness of the low-ball procedure in a variety of circumstances (see Brownstein & Katzev, 1985; Burger & Petty, 1981; Joule, 1987; see Cialdini , Cacioppo, Bassett, & Miller 1978 for full details). "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"89 Chapter 3 shows how the low-ball procedure can infl uence homeowners to conserve energy. The project began at the start of the Iowa wint er when residents who heated their homes with natural gas were contacted by an interviewer. The interviewer gave them some energy-conservation tips and asked them to tr y to save fuel in the future. Although they all agreed to try, when the researchers exam ined the utility records of these families after a month and again at winter's end, it wa s clear that no real savings had occurred. The residents who had promised to make a conservation attempt used just as much natural gas as did a random sample of thei r neighbors who had not b een contacted by an interviewer. Good intentions coupled with information abou t saving fuel, then, were not enough to change habits. Even before the project began, Pallak and his research team had recognized that something more would be needed to shift long-standing energy-us e patterns. So they tried a slightly different procedure on a comp arable sample of Iowa natural-gas users. These people, too, were contacted by an in terviewer, who provided energy-saving hints and asked them to conserve, but for these families, the interviewer offered something else: Those residents agreeing to save en ergy would have their names publicized in newspaper articles as public-spirited, fu el-conserving citizens. The effect was immediate. One month later, when the u tility companies checked their meters, the homeowners in this sample had saved an aver age of 422 cubic feet of natural gas apiece. The chance to have their names in the paper had motivated these residents to substantial conservation efforts for a period of a month. Then the rug was pulled out. The researcher s extracted the reason that had initially caused the people to save fuel. Each family that had been promised publicity received a letter saying it would not be possibl e to publicize its name after all. At the end of the winter, the research team examined the effect the letter had on the natural-gas usage of the families. Did they return to their old, wasteful habits when the chance to be in the newspape r was removed? Hardly. For each of the remaining winter months, these families actually conserved more fuel than they had during the time they thought they would be publicly celebrated fo r it! In terms of pe rcentage of energy savings, they had managed a 12.2 percent ga s savings during the first month because they expected to see themselves lauded in th e paper. However, after the letter arrived informing them to the contrary, they did not return to their previ ous energy-use levels; instead, they increased their savings to a 15.5 percent level for the rest of the winter. Although we can never be completely sure of such things, one explanation for their persistent behavior presents itself immedi ately. These people had been low-balled into a conservation commitment through a promise of newspaper publicity. Once made, that commitment started generating its own s upport: The homeowners began acquiring new energy habits, began feeling good about their public-spirited effort s, began convincing themselves of the vital need to reduce American dependence on foreign fuel, began appreciating the monetary savings in thei r utility bills, began feeling proud of their capacity for self-denial, and most important , began viewing themselves as conservation- minded. With all these new reasons present to justify the commitment "},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Commitment and Consistency 89 B "},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"90 Chapter 3 to use less energy, it is no wonder that the commitment remained firm even after the original reason, newspaper public ity, had been kicked away. Strangely enough, though, when the publicity fact or was no longer a possibility, these families did not merely maintain their fuel-saving effort, they heightened it. Any of a number of interpretations could be offered for that still stronger effort, but I have a favorite. In a way, the opportunity to receive newspaper publicity had prevented the homeowners from fully owning their commit ment to conservation. Of all the reasons supporting the decision to try to save fuel, it was the only one that had come from the outside; it was the only one preventing the homeowners from thinking that they were conserving gas because they believed in it. So when the letter arrived canceling the publicity agreement, it removed the only impe diment to these residents' images of themselves as fully concerned, energy-cons cious citizens. This unqualified, new self- image then pushed them to even greater he ights of conservation. Much like Sara, they appeared to have become committed to a ch oice through an initial inducement and were still more dedicated to it afte r the inducement had been removed. 5 DEFENSE The only effective defense I know against th e weapons of influence embodied in the combined principles of commitment and c onsistency is an awareness that, although consistency is generally good, even vital, there is a foolish, rigid variety to be shunned. We must be wary of the tendency to be auto matically and unthinkingly consistent, for it lays us open to the maneuvers of thos e who want to exploit the mechanical commitment-consistency sequence for profit. Since automatic consistency is so useful in allowing us an economical and appropriate way of behaving most of the time, however, we can't decide merely to eliminate it from our lives altogether. The results would be di sastrous. If, rather than whirring along in accordance with our prior decisions and deed s, we stopped to think through the merits of each new action before performing it, we would never have time to accomplish anything significant. We need even that da ngerous, mechanical brand of consistency. The only way out of the dilemma is to know when such consistency 5 Fortunately, it is not necessary to use so deceptive an approach as the low-ball technique to employ the power of the co mmitment/consistency principle in public- service campaigns. An impressive series of studies by Richard Katzev and his students at Reed College has demonstrated the effec tiveness of commitment tactics like written pledges and foot-in-the-door procedures in increasing such energy conservation behaviors as recycling, elect ricity usage, and bus ridership (Bachman & Katzev, 1982; Katzev & Johnson, 1983, 1984; Katzev & Pard ini, 1988; Pardini & Katzev, 1983-84).

We re gister each type in a di fferent part of our bodies. Stomach Signs The first signal is easy to recognize. It occu rs right in the pit of our stomachs when we realize we are trapped into complying with a request we know we don't want to perform. It has happened to me a hundred times. An especially memorable instance, though, took place on a summer evening well before I began to study compliance tactics. I answered my doorbell to find a stunning young woman dre ssed in shorts and a revealing halter top. I noticed, nonetheless, that she was ca rrying a clipboard and was asking me to participate in a survey. Wanting to make a favorable impression, I agreed and, I do admit, stretched the truth in my interview answ ers in order to present myself in the most positive light. Our conversation went as follows: Stunning Young Woman: Hello! I'm doing a survey on the entertainment habits of city residents, and I wonder if you could answer a few questions for me. Cialdini: Do come in. SYW: Thank you. I'll just sit right here and begin. How many times per week would you say you go out to dinner? C: Oh, probably three, maybe four times a week. Whenever I can, really; I love fine restaurants. SYW: How nice. And do you usually order wine with your dinner? C: Only if it's imported. SYW: I see. What about movies? Do you go to the movies much? C: The cinema? I can't get enough of good films. I especially like the sophisticated kind with the words on the bottom of the screen. How about you? Do you like to see films? SYW: Uh ... yes, I do. But let's get back to th e interview. Do you go to many concerts? C: Definitely. The symphonic stuff mostly, of course. But I do enjoy a quality pop group as well. SYW: (writing rapidly). Great! just one more question. What about touring performances by theatrical or ballet companies? Do you see them when they're in town? C: Ah, the ballet—the movement, the grace, the form—I love it. Mark me down as loving the ballet. See it every chance I get. SYW: Fine. Just let me recheck my figures here for a moment, Mr. Cialdini. C: Actually, it's Dr. Cialdini. But that sounds so formal. Why don't you call me Bob? SYW: All right, Bob. From the information you've already given me, I'm pleased to say you could save up to $1,200 a year by joining Clubamerica! A small membership fee entitles you to discounts on most of the activities you've mentioned. Surely"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"92 Chapter 3 someone as socially vigorous as yourself would want to take advantage of the tremendous savings our company can offer on a ll the things you've already told me you do. C: (trapped like a rat). Well... uh ... I... uh ... I guess so. I remember quite well feeling my stomach ti ghten as I stammered my agreement. It was a clear call to my brain, \"Hey, you're being taken here!\" But I couldn't see a way out. I had been cornered by my own words. To d ecline her offer at that point would have meant facing a pair of distasteful alternatives : If I tried to back out by protesting that I was not actually the man-about-town I had cl aimed to be during the interview, I would come off a liar; trying to refu se without that protest would make me come off a fool for not wanting to save $1,200.1 bought the ente rtainment package, even though I knew I had been set up. The need to be consistent with what I had already said snared me. No more, though. I listen to my stomach thes e days, and I have di scovered a way to handle people who try to use the consistenc y principle on me. I ju st tell them exactly what they are doing. This tactic has become the perfect counterattack for me. Whenever my stomach tells me I would be a sucker to comply with a request merely because doing so would be consistent with some pr ior commitment I was tricked into, I relay that message to the requester. I don't try to deny the importance of consistency; I just point out the absurdity of f oolish consistency. Whether, in response, the requester shrinks away guiltily or retreat s in bewilderment, I am content. I have won; an exploiter has lost. I sometimes think about the way it would be if that stunning young woman of years ago were to try to sell me an entertainment-club membership now. I have it all worked out. The entire interaction would be the same, except for the end: SYW: ... Surely someone as socially vigorous as yourself would want to take advantage of the tremendous savings our company can o ffer on all the things you've already told me you do. C: (with great self-assurance). Quite wrong. You see, I rec ognize what has gone on here. I know that your story about doing a survey was just a pretext for getting people to tell you how often they go out and that, unde r those circumstances, there is a natural tendency to exaggerate. And I re fuse to allow myself to be locked into a mechanical sequence of commitment and consiste ncy when I know it's wrong-headed. No click, whirr for me. SYW: Huh? C: Okay, let me put it this way: (1) It w ould be stupid of me to spend money on something I don't want. (2) I have it on excelle nt authority, direct from my stomach, that I don't want your entertainment plan. (3) Theref ore, if you still believe that I will buy it, you probably also still believe in the Tooth Fairy. Surely, someone as intelligent as yourself would be able to understand that. SYW: (trapped like a stunning young rat) Well... uh ... I... uh ... I guess so. "},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Commitment and Consistency 93 Heart-of-Hearts Signs Stomachs are not especially perceptive or subtle organs. Only when it is obvious that we are about to be conned are th ey likely to register and tr ansmit that message. At other times, when it is not clear that we are being taken, our stomach s may never catch on. Under those circumstances we have to look elsewhere for a clue. The situation of my neighbor Sara provides a good illustration. Sh e made an important commitment to Tim by canceling her prior marriage plans. The commitment has grown its own supports, so that even though the original reasons for the commitment are gone, she remains in harmony with it. She has convinced herself w ith newly formed reasons that she did the right thing, so she stays with Tim. It is not difficult to see why there would be no tightening in Sara's stomach as a result. St omachs tell us when we are doing something we think is wrong for us. Sara thinks no such thing. To her mind, she has chosen correctly and is behaving cons istently with that choice. Yet, unless I badly miss my guess, there is a pa rt of Sara that recognizes her choice as a mistake and her current living arrangement as a brand of foolish consistency. Where, exactly, that part of Sara is located we can 't be sure, but our language does give it a name: heart of hearts. It is , by definition, the one place wh ere we cannot fool ourselves. It is the place where none of our justifications, none of our rationalizations penetrate. Sara has the truth there, a lthough right now she can't hear its signal clearly through the noise and static of the new s upport apparatus she has erected. If Sara has erred in her c hoice of Tim, how long can she go without clearly recognizing it, without having a massive heart-of-hearts attack? There is no telling. One thing is certain, however: As time passes, the various alternatives to Tim are disappearing. She had better determine soon whether she is making a mistake. Easier said than done, of course. She must answer an extremely intricate question: \"Knowing what I now know, if I could go back in time, would I make the same choice?\" The problem lies in the \"knowing what I now know\" part of the question, just what does she now know, accurately, about Tim? How much of what she thinks of him is the result of a desperate attempt to justif y the commitment she made? She claims that, since her decision to take him back, he cares for her more, is trying hard to stop his excessive drinking, has learned to make a wonderful omelet, etc. Having tasted a couple of his omelets, I have my doubts. The important issue, though, is whether she believes these things, not just intellectua lly—but in her heart of hearts. There may be a little device Sara can us e to find out how mu ch of her current satisfaction with Tim is real and how mu ch is foolish consistency. Psychological evidence indicates that we experience our feelings toward something a split second before we can intellectualize about it (Mur phy & Zajonc, 1993). My suspicion is that the message sent by the heart of hearts is a pure, basic feeling. Therefore, if we train ourselves to be attentive, we should register the feeling ev er so slightly before our "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"94 Chapter 3 cognitive apparatus engages. According to th is approach, were Sara to ask herself the crucial \"would I make the same choice agai n?\" question, she would be well advised to look for and trust the first flash of feeling sh e experienced in response. It would likely be the signal from her heart of hearts, sli pping through undistorted ju st before the means by which she could kid herself flooded in. 6 I have begun using the same device myself when ever I even suspect I might be acting in a foolishly consistent manner. One time, for instance, I had stopped at the self-service pump of a filling station advertising a price per gallon a couple of cents below the rate of other stations in the area; but with pump nozzle in hand, I noticed that the price listed on the pump was two cents higher than the display sign price. When I mentioned the difference to a passing attendant, who I la ter learned was the owner, he mumbled unconvincingly that the rates had changed a few days ago, but there hadn't been time to correct the display. I tried to decide what to do. Some reasons for staying came to mind—\"I really do need gasoline ba dly.\" \"This pump is availabl e, and I am in sort of a hurry.\" \"I think I remember that my car runs better on this brand of gas.\" I needed to determine whether those reasons we re genuine or mere justifications for my decision to stop there. So I asked myself the crucia l question, \"Knowing what I know about the real price of this gasoline, if I c ould go back in time, would I make the same choice again?\" Concentrating on the first burst of impression I sensed, I received a clear and unqualified answer. I would have driven right past. I wouldn't even have slowed down. I knew then that, without the price adva ntage, those other reasons would not have brought me there. They hadn't created the decision; the decision had created them. That settled, there was another decision to be faced. Since I was already there holding the hose, wouldn't it be better to use it th an to suffer the inconvenience of going elsewhere to pay the same price? Fortunate ly, the station attendant-owner came over and helped me make up my mi nd. He asked why I wasn't pu mping any gas. I told him I didn't like the price discrepancy and he sa id with a snarl, \"Listen, nobody's gonna tell me how to run my business. If you think I'm cheating you, just put that hose down right now and get off my property as fast as you can do it, bud.\" Already certain he was a cheat, I was happy to act consis tently with my belief and his wishes. I dropped the hose on the spot. . . and drove over it on my way to the closest exit. Sometimes consistency can be a marvelously rewarding thing. 6 This is not to say that what we feel about an issue is always different from or always to be trusted more than what we think about it. However, the data are clear that our emotions and beliefs often do not point in th e same direction. Therefore, in situations involving a commitment likely to have gene rated supporting rationa lizations, feelings may well provide the truer counsel. This would be especially so when, as in the question of Sara's happiness, the issue at hand concerns an emotion (Wilson et al., 1989). "},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Commitment and Consistency 95 READER'S REPORT 3.2 From a Woman Living in Portland, Oregon I was walking through downtown Portland on my way to a lunch appointment when a young, attractive man stopped me with a friend ly smile and a powerful line. \"Excuse me,\" he said, \"I'm involved in a contes t and I need a good-looking woman like yourself to help me win.\" I was truly skeptical since I know there ar e many women more attractive than myself runni ng around; however, I was caught off guard and was curious to find out what he wanted. He explained th at he would receive points for a contest by getting total strangers to give him a kiss. Now, I consider myself to be a fairly level- headed person who shouldn't have believed hi s line, but he was quite persistent, and since I was almost late for my lunch appoi ntment, I thought, \"What the heck, I'll give the guy a kiss and get out of here.\" So I did something to tally against my common sense and pecked this total stranger on the cheek in the middle of downtown Portland! I thought that would be the end of it, but I soon learned th at it was just the beginning. Much to my distress, he followed the kiss w ith the line, \"You are a great kisser, but the real contest I am involved in is to sell ma gazine subscriptions. You must be an active person. Would any of these magazines intere st you?\" At this point I should have slugged the guy and walked away, but somehow, because I had complied with his initial request, I felt a need to be consistent and I complied with his second request. Yes, much to my own disbelief, I actually subscribed to SKI magazine (which I occasionally enjoy reading, but had no intention to subscribing to), gave him a $5 in itial subscription fee and left as quickly as possible, feeling quite frustrated with what I had just done and not understanding why I had done it. Although it still pains me to th ink about it, in reflecting on the incident after reading your book I've now figured out what happene d. The reason this ta ctic worked so effectively is because once small commitments have been made (in this case, giving a kiss), people tend to add justifications to support the commitment, and then are willing to commit themselves further. In this situation, I justified comply ing with the second request because it was consistent with my initial action. If I had only listened to my \"stomach signs,\" I could have sa ved myself a lot of humiliation. Authors'note: By extracting a kiss, the salesman exp loited the consistency principle in two ways. First, by the time he asked for he r aid in the magazine contest, his prospect had already gone on record—with that kiss — as agreeing to help him win a contest. Second, it seems only natural (i.e., congruent) that if a woman feels positively enough toward a man to kiss him, she should f eel positively toward helping him out. SUMMARY Psychologists have long recogn ized a desire in most peopl e to be and look consistent within their words, beliefs, attitudes, and d eeds. This tendency for consistency is fed from three sources. First, good pe rsonal consistency is highly "},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"96 Chapter 3 valued by society. Second, aside from its e ffect on public image, generally consistent conduct provides a beneficial approach to daily life. Third, a consistent orientation affords a valuable shortcut through the complexity of modern existence. By being consistent with earlier decisi ons, one reduces the need to process all the relevant information in future similar situations; in stead, one merely needs to recall the earlier decision and to respond consistently with it. • Within the realm of compliance, securi ng an initial commitment is the key. After making a commitment (that is, taking a sta nd or position), people are more willing to agree to requests that are in keeping with the prior commitment. Thus, many compliance professionals try to induce peopl e to take an initial position that is consistent with a behavior they will later request from these people. Not all commitments are equally effective, however, in producing consistent future action. Commitments are most effective when they ar e active, public, effortful, and viewed as internally motivated (uncoerced). • Commitment decisions, even erroneous ones, have a tendency to be self-perpetuating because they can \"grow their own legs.\" That is, people often add new reasons and justifications to support the wisdom of co mmitments they have already made. As a consequence, some commitments remain in ef fect long after the conditions that spurred them have changed. This phenomenon explains the effectiveness of certain deceptive compliance practices such as \"throwing the low-ball.\" • To recognize and resist the undue infl uence of consistency pressures on our compliance decisions, we should listen for si gnals coming from two places within us: our stomachs and our heart of hearts. Stomach signs appear when we realize that we are being pushed by commitment and consistency pressures to agree to requests we know we don't want to perform. Under these ci rcumstances, it is best to explain to the requester that such compliance would constitute a brand of foolish consistency in which we prefer not to engage. Heart-of-heart si gns are different. They are best employed when it is not clear to us th at an initial commitment was wrongheaded. Here, we should ask ourselves a crucial ques tion, \"Knowing what I know, if I could go back in time, would I make the same commitment?\" One in formative answer may come as the first flash of feeling registered.

In fact, when I surveyed the people who came into my office one day—several studen ts, two telephone repairmen, a number of university professors, and the janitor—the reaction was invariably critical. Television, with its incessant system of laugh tracks a nd technically augmente d mirth, received the most heat. The people I questioned hated canned laughter. They called it stupid, phony, and obvious. Although my sample was small, I would bet that it closely reflects the negative feelings of most of the Am erican public toward laugh tracks. Why, then, is canned laughter so popular wi th television executives? They have won their exalted positions and splendid salaries by knowing how to gi ve the public what it wants. Yet they religiously employ the laugh tr acks that their audiences find distasteful, and they do so over th e objections of many of their most talented artists. It is not uncommon for acclaimed directors, writers, or actors to demand the elimination of canned responses from the television projec ts they undertake. Th ese demands are only sometimes successful, and when they are, it is not without a battle, as has been the case with ABC's critically acclaimed situation-comedy Sports Night. Although the show's producers pressed from the start for laugh-t rack-free airings, network officials have relented in only one instance—when an epis ode explored the sensitive issue of sexual assault (Collins, 1998). What can it be about canned laughter that is so attractive to tele vision executives? Why are these shrewd and tested people championi ng a practice that their potential watchers find disagreeable and their most creative tale nts find personally insulting? The answer is both simple and intriguing: They know what the research says. Experiments have found that the use of canned merriment causes an audience to laugh longer and more often when humorous material is presented and to rate the material as funnier (Fuller & Sheehy-Skeffington, 1974; Smyth & Fuller, 1972). In addition, some evidence indicates that canned laughter is most effective for poor jokes (No-sanchuk & Lightstone, 1974). In light of these data, the actions of tele vision executives make perfect sense. The introduction of laugh tracks into their comic programmi ng increases the humorous and appreciative responses of an audience, eve n—and especially—when the material is of poor quality. Is it any surprise, then, that television, glutted as it is with artless situation- comedies, is saturated with canned laughter ? Those executives know precisely what they are doing. With the mystery of the widespread use of laugh tracks solved, we are left with a more perplexing question: Why does canned laughter work on us the way it does? It is no longer the television executives who appear peculiar; they are acting logically and in their own interests. Instead, it is the behavi or of the audience that seems strange. Why should we laugh more at comedy material aflo at in a sea of mechanically fabricated merriment? And why should we think that comi c flotsam funnier? The executives aren't really fooling us. Anyone can recognize dubbed laughter. It is 99 "},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"100 Chapter 4 so blatant, so clearly counterfeit, that there can be no confusing it with the real thing. We know full well that the hilari ty we hear is irrelevant to the humorous quality of the joke it follows, is created not spontaneously by a genuine audience but artificially by a technician at a control board. Yet, transp arent forgery that it is, it works on us! THE PRINCIPLE OF SOCIAL PROOF To discover why canned laughter is so effective, we first need to understand the nature of yet another potent weapon of influence: th e principle of social proof. This principle states that we determine what is correct by finding out what other people think is correct. The principle applies especially to the way we decide what constitutes correct behavior. We view a behavior as correct in a given situation to the degree that we see others performing it. Whether the question is what to do with an empty popcorn box in a movie theater, how fast to drive on a certa in stretch of highwa y, or how to eat the chicken at a dinner party, the actions of those around us will be important guides in defining the answer. The tendency to see an action as appropriate when others are doing it works quite well normally. As a rule, we will make fewer mistakes by acting in accord with social evidence than by acting contrary to it. Usually, when a lot of people are doing something, it is the right thing to do. This f eature of the principle of social proof is simultaneously its major strength and its ma jor weakness. Like the other weapons of influence, it provides a conve nient shortcut for determinin g the way to behave but, at the same time, makes one who uses the shortc ut vulnerable to the attacks of profiteers who lie in wait along its path. In the case of canned laughter , the problem comes when we begin responding to social proof in such a mindless and reflexive fashion that we can be fooled by partial or fake evidence. Our folly is not that we use others ' laughter to help decide what is humorous; that is in keeping with the we ll-founded principle of social pr oof. The folly is that we do so in response to patently fraudulent la ughter. Somehow, one disembodied feature of humor—a sound—works like the essence of hum or. The example from Chapter 1 of the turkey and the polecat is instru ctive. Because the peculiar ch eep-cheep of turkey chicks is normally associated with newborn turkey s, their mothers will display or withhold maternal care solely on the basis of that sound. Remember how, consequently, it was possible to fool a mother turkey with a stuffe d polecat as long as the replica played the recorded cheep-cheep of a baby turkey. The simulated chick sound was enough to start the mother turkey's maternal tape whirring. The lesson of the turkey and the polecat illustrates uncomfortably well the relationship between the average viewer and the laugh-tr ack-playing television executive. We have become so accustomed to taking the humorous reactions of others as evidence of what deserves laughter that we too can be made to respond to the sound, and not the substance, of the real thing. Much as a cheep -cheep noise removed fr om the reality of a chick can stimulate a female turkey to mother, so can a recorded ha-ha removed from the reality of a genuine audience stimulate us to laugh.

They know that their tapes will cue our tapes. Click, whirr. People Power Television executives are hardly alone in th eir use of social evidence for profit. Our tendency to assume that an action is more corr ect if others are doing it is exploited in a variety of settings. Bartenders often salt th eir tip jars with a fe w dollar bills at the beginning of an evening to simulate tips left by prior customers and thereby to give the impression that tipping with folding money is proper barroom behavior. Church ushers sometimes salt collection baskets for the same reason and with the same positive effect on proceeds. Evangelical preachers are known to seed their audience with ringers, who are rehearsed to come forward at a specifi ed time to give witness and donations. For example, a research team at Arizona Stat e University infiltrated the Billy Graham organization and reported on such advance pr eparations prior to one of his Crusade visits: \"By the time Graham arrives in town and makes his altar call, an army of six thousand wait with instructions on when to co me forth at varying intervals to create the impression of a spontaneous mass ou tpouring\" (Al-theide & Johnson, 1977). Advertisers love to inform us when a pr oduct is the \"fastest-g rowing\" or \"largest- selling\" because they don't have to convince us directly that the product is good; they need only say that many others think s o, which seems proof enough. The producers of charity telethons devote inordinate amounts of time to the incessant listing of viewers who have already pledged contributions. The message being communicated to the holdouts is clear: \"Look at all the pe ople who have decided to give. It must be the correct thing to do.\" Certain nightclub owne rs manufacture a brand of visible social proof for their clubs' quality by creating long waiting lines outside when there is plenty of room inside. Salespeople ar e taught to spice their pitc hes with numerous accounts of individuals who have purchas ed the product. Sales and mo tivation consultant Cavett Robert captures the principle nicely in his advi ce to sales trainees: \"Since 95 percent of the people are imitators and only 5 percent in itiators, people are persuaded more by the actions of others than by any proof we can offer.\" Researchers, too, have employed procedures based on the principle of social proof— sometimes with as tounding results. 1 One psychologist in part icular, Albert Bandura, has led the way in developing such pr ocedures to eliminate undesirable A program of investigation conducted by Kenneth Craig an d his associates demonstrates how the experience of pain can be affected by the principle of social proof. In one study (Craig & Prkachin, 1978), subjects who received a series of electric shocks felt less pain (as indicated by self -reports, psychophysical measures of sensory sensitivity, and such physiological responses as heart rate and sk in conductivity) when they were in the presence of another subjec t who was tolerating the shocks as if they were not painful.

For instance, in an early study (Bandura, Grusec, & Menlove, 1967), nursery-s chool-age children, chosen because they were terrified of dogs, merely watched a little boy pl aying happily with a dog for 20 minutes a day. This exhibition produced such marked changed"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Social Proof 103 in the reactions of the fearful children that, after only four days, 67 percent of them were willing to climb into a playpen with a dog and remain confined there petting and scratching the dog while everyone else left the room. Moreover, when the researchers tested the children's fear leve ls again, one month later, th ey found that the improvement had not diminished during that time; in fact , the children were more willing than ever to interact with dogs. An importa nt practical discovery was made in a second study of children who were exceptionally afraid of dogs (Bandura & Menlove, 1968): To reduce these children's fears, it was not necessary to provide live demonstrations of another child playing with a dog; film clips had the same impact. The most effective clips were those depicting a variety of other children interacting with thei r dogs. Apparently, the principle of social proof works best when the proof is provided by the actions of many other people. 2 The powerful influence of filmed examples in changing the behavior of children can be used as therapy for various other problems. Some striking evidence is available in the research of psychologist Robert O'Connor (1972) on socially withdrawn preschool children. We have all seen children of this sort: terribly shy, st anding alone at the fringes of the games and groupi ngs of their peers. O'Connor worried that this early behavior was the beginning of what could become a long-term pattern of isolation, which in turn could create persistent diffi culties in social comfort and adjustment throughout adulthood. In an attempt to reve rse the pattern, O'Connor made a film containing 11 different scenes in a nursery-school setting. Each scene began by showing a different solitary child watching some social activity and then activ ely participating, to everyone's enjoyment. O'Connor selected a group of the most severely withdrawn children from four preschools and showed them this film. The impact was impressive. After watching the film, the isol ates immediately began to inte ract with thei r peers at a level equal to that of the normal children in the schools. Even more astonishing was what O'Connor found when he returned to the schools six weeks later to observe. While the withdrawn children who had not seen O'Con nor's film remained as isolated as ever, those who hod viewed it were now leading their school s in amount of social activity. It seems that this 23-minute movie, viewed Any reader who doubts that the seeming appr opriateness of an action is importantly influenced by the number of others perfor ming it might try a small experiment. Stand on a busy sidewalk, pick an empty spot in the s ky or on a tall building, and stare at it for a full minute.

Now, on the next day, go to the same Place and bring al ong four friends to look upward too. Within 60 seconds, a crowd of passers by will have stopped to crane their necks skyward with the group. For those pedestrians who do not join you, the pressure to look up at least briefly will be nearly irresist able; if the results of your expe riment are like those of one performed by three social psychologists in New York, you and your friends will cause 80 percent of all passersby to lift their gaze to your empty spot (Milgram, Bickman, & Berkowitz, 1969).

Several features account for its appeal: It offers a su- 3 Other research besides O'Connor's suggests that there are two sides to the filmed- social-proof coin, however. The dramatic effect of filmed depictions on what children find appropriate has been a source of great distress for those conc erned with frequent depictions of violence and aggressi on on television (Er on & Huesmann, 1985). Although the consequences of te levised violence on the aggr essive actions of children are far from simple (Freedman, 1984), the da ta from a well-controlled experiment by psychologists Robert Liebert and Robert Baron (1972) have an ominous look. Some children were shown excerpts from a televi sion program in which people intentionally harmed each other. Afterward, these children acted in a significantly more harmful way toward other children than did those who had watched a nonviolen t television program (a horse race). The finding that children act more aggressively toward one another after seeing aggression on television held true for the two age groups tested (5- to 6- and 8- to 9-year-olds) and for both girls and boys. "},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Social Proof 105 perb example of the much underused met hod of participant observation, in which a scientist studies a process by becoming immersed in its natural occurrence; it provides information of interest to such diverse groups as historians, psychologists, and theologians; and, most important, it shows how social evidence can be used on us— not by others, but by ourselves—to assure us that wh at we prefer to be true will seem to be true. The story is an old one, requi ring an examination of ancient data, for the past is dotted with millennial religious movements. Various sects and cults have prophesied that on a particular date there would arrive a peri od of redemption and great happiness for those who believed in the group's teachings. In each instance it has been predicted that the beginning of a time of salvation would be marked by an important and undeniable event, usually the cataclysmic end of the world. Of course, these predictions have invariably proved false, to the acute dismay of the members of such groups. However, immediately following the obvious failu re of the prophecy, history records an enigmatic pattern. Rather than disbanding in disillusion, the cultists often become strengthened in their convictions. Risking th e ridicule of the populace, they take to the streets, publicly asserting th eir dogma and seeking converts with a fervor that is intensified, not diminished, by the clear disconfirmation of a central belief. So it was with the Montanists of s econd-century Turkey, with th e Anabaptists of sixteenth- century Holland, with the Sabbataists of seventeenth-century Izmir, and with the Millerites of nineteenth-centu ry America. And, thought a trio of interested social scientists, so it might be with a doomsda y cult based in modern-day Chicago. The scientists—Leon Festinger, Henry Riecke n, and Stanley Schach ter—who were then colleagues at the University of Minnesota, heard about the Chicago group and felt it worthy of close study. Their decision to investigate by joining the group, incognito, as new believers and by placing additional paid observers among its ranks resulted in a remarkably rich firsthand account of the goings-on before an d after the day of predicted catastrophe (Festinger, Rieck en, & Schachter, 1964). The cult of believers was small, never num bering more than 30 members. Its leaders were a middle-aged man and woman, whom for purposes of publication, the researchers renamed Dr. Thomas Armstrong and Mrs. Marian Keech. Dr. Armstrong, a physician on the staff of a college student-health servi ce, had a long-held inte rest in mysticism, the occult, and flying saucers; as such, he served as a respected authority on these subjects for the group. Mrs. Keech, though, wa s the center of attention and activity. Earlier in the year she had begun to receiv e messages from spiritual beings, whom she called the Guardians, located on other planet s. It was these messages, flowing through Marian Keech's hand via the device of \"automa tic writing,\" that formed the bulk of the cult's religious belief system. The teachings of the Guardians were loosely linked to traditional Christian thought. The transmissions from the Guardians, al ways the subject of much discussion and interpretation among the group, gained new sign ificance when they began to foretell of a great impending disaster—a flood that w ould begin in the Western Hemisphere and eventually engulf the world. Althoug h the cultists were understandably"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"106 Chapter 4 alarmed at first, further messages assured th em that they and all those who believed in the lessons sent through Mrs. Keech woul d survive. Before the calamity, spacemen were to arrive and carry off the believers in flying saucers to a place of safety, presumably on another planet. Very little de tail was provided about the rescue except that the believers were to make themse lves ready for pickup by rehearsing certain passwords to be exchanged (\"I left my hat at home.\" \"What is your question?\" \"I am my own porter.\") and by removing all metal fr om their clothes—becau se the wearing or carrying of metal made saucer travel \"extremely dangerous.\" As Festinger, Riecken, and Schachter observe d the preparations during the weeks prior to the flood date, they noted with special interest two significant aspects of the members' behavior. First, the level of commit ment to the cult's belief system was very high. In anticipation of their departure from doomed Earth, i rrevocable steps were taken by the group members. Most incurred the opposition of family and friends to their beliefs but persisted, nonetheless, in their convictions, often when it meant losing the affections of these others. In fact, severa l of the members were threatened by neighbors or family with legal actions designed to have them declared insane. Dr. Armstrong's sister filed a motion to have his two younge r children removed from his custody. Many believers quit their jobs or neglected their studies to devote full time to the movement. Some even gave or threw away their persona l belongings, expecting them shortly to be of no use. These were people whose certainty that they had the truth allowed them to withstand enormous social, economic, and legal pressure s and whose commitment to their dogma grew as they resisted each pressure. The second significant aspect of the believers' preflood actions was a curious form of inaction. For individuals so cl early convinced of the validity of thei r creed, they did surprisingly little to spread the word. Although they initially publicized the news of the coming disaster, they made no attempt to se ek converts, to pros elyte actively. They were willing to sound the al arm and to counsel those w ho voluntarily responded to it, but that was all. The group's distaste for recruitment efforts wa s evident in various wa ys besides the lack of personal persuasion attempts. Secrecy was maintained in many matters— extra copies of the lessons were burned, passwords and secret signs were instituted, the contents of certain private tape recordings were not to be discussed with outsiders (so secret were the tapes that even longtime be lievers were prohibited from taking notes of them). Publicity was avoided. As the day of disaster approached, increasing numbers of newspaper, television, and radio reporters converged on the group's headquarters in the Keech house. For the most part, these people were turned away or ignored. The most frequent answer to their questions was, \"No comment.\" Although discouraged for a time, the media representatives returned with a vengeance when Dr. Armstrong's religious activities caused him to be fired from his post on the college health service staff; one especially persistent newsman had to be threatened with a lawsuit. A similar siege was repelled on the eve of th e flood when a swarm of reporters "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Social Proof 107 pushed and pestered the believers for information. Afterward, the researchers summarized the group's preflood stance on public exposure and recruitment in respectful tones: \"Exposed to a tremendous burst of publicity, they had made every attempt to dodge fame; given dozens of opportu nities to proselyte, they had remained evasive and secretive and behaved with an al most superior indifference\" (Festinger et al., 1964). Eventually, when all the repor ters and would-be converts had been cleared from the house, the believers began making their fi nal preparations for the arrival of the spaceship scheduled for midnight that nigh t. The scene as viewed by Festinger, Riecken, and Schachter must have seemed like absurdist theater. Otherwise ordinary people—housewives, college students, a high-school boy, a publisher, a physician, a hardware-store clerk and his mother—were pa rticipating earnestly in tragic comedy. They took direction from a pair of member s who were periodically in touch with the Guardians; Marian Keech's written messages were being supplemented that evening by \"the Bertha,\" a former beautician through whose tongue the \"Creat or\" gave instruction. They rehearsed their lines diligently, calling out in chorus the responses to be made before entering the rescue saucer: \"I am my own porter.\" \"I am my own pointer.\" They discussed seriously whether the message from a caller identifying himself as Captain Video—a TV space character of the time—wa s properly interpreted as a prank or a coded communication from their rescuers. In keeping with the admonition to carry nothing metallic aboard the saucer, the believers wore clothing from which all metal pieces had been torn out. The metal eyelets in their shoes had been ripped away. The women were braless or wore brassieres whose metal stays had been removed. The me n had yanked the zi ppers out of their pants, which were supported by lengths of rope in place of belts. The group's fanaticism concerning the removal of all metal was vividly experienced by one of the researchers who remarked, 25 minut es before midnight, that he had forgotten to extract the zipper from his trousers. As the observers te ll it, \"this knowledge produced a near panic reaction. He was rush ed into the bedroom where Dr. Armstrong, his hands trembling and his eyes darting to the clock every few seconds, slashed out the zipper with a razor blade and wrenched its cl asps free with wire-cutters.\" The hurried operation finished, the researcher was return ed to the living room—a slightly less metallic but, one supposes, much paler man. As the time appointed for their departure grew ve ry close, the believers settled into a lull of soundless anticipation. Luckily, the trained scientists gave a deta iled account of the events that transpired du ring this momentous period. The last ten minutes were tense ones for th e group in the living room. They had nothing to do but sit and wait, their coats in their laps. In the tense silence two clocks ticked loudly, one about ten minutes fa ster than the other. When th e faster of the two pointed to twelve-five, one of the observers remar ked aloud on the fact. A chorus of people replied that midnight had not yet come. Bob Eastman affirmed that the slower clock was "},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"108 Chapter 4 correct; he had set it himself only that after noon. It showed only four minutes before midnight. These four minutes passed in complete sile nce except for a single ut terance. When the [slower] clock on the mantel showed only one minute remaining before the guide to the saucer was due, Marian exclaimed in a stra ined, high-pitched voice: \"And not a plan has gone astray!\" The clock chimed twelve, ea ch stroke painfully cl ear in the expectant hush. The believers sat motionless. One might have expected some visible re action. Midnight had passed and nothing had happened. The cataclysm itself was less than se ven hours away. But there was little to see in the reactions of the people in the room. There was no talking, no sound. People sat stock-still, their faces s eemingly frozen and expressionle ss. Mark Post war the only person who even moved. He lay down on the sofa and closed his eyes but did not sleep. Later, when spoken to, he answered monosy llabically but otherwise lay immobile. The others showed nothing on the surface, although it became clear later that they had been hit hard.... Gradually, painfully, an atmosphere of de spair and confusion settled over the group. They reexamined the prediction and the accompanying messages. Dr. Armstrong and Mrs. Keech reiterated their faith. The be lievers mulled over their predicament and discarded explanation after expl anation as unsatisfactory. At one point, toward 4 A.M., Mrs. Keech broke down and cried bitterly. She knew, she sobbed, that there were some who were beginning to doubt but that the gr oup must beam light to those who needed it most and that the group must hold together. The rest of the believers were losing their composure, too. They were all visibly shaken and many were close to tears. It was now almost 4:30 A.M. and still no way of handl ing the disconfirmati on had been found. By now, too, most of the group were talking openl y about the failure of the escort to come at midnight. The group seemed near disso lution. (Festinger et al., 1964, pp. 162-163, 168) In the midst of gathering doubt, as cracks craw led through the believ ers' confidence, the researchers witnessed a pair of remarkable incidents, one after another. The first occurred at about 4:45 A.M. when Marian Keech's hand suddenly began transcribing through \"automatic writing\" the text of a holy message from above. When read aloud, the communication proved to be an elegant explanation for the events of that night. \"The little group, sitting alone all night long, had spread so much light that God had saved the world from destruction.\" Although neat and efficient, this explanation was not wholly satisfying by itself; for example, afte r hearing it, one member simply rose, put on his hat and coat, and left, ne ver to return. Something addi tional was needed to restore the believers to their pr evious levels of faith. "},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Social Proof 109 It was at this point that th e second notable incident occurr ed to supply that need. Once again, the words of those who were present offer a vivid description: The atmosphere in the group changed abruptly and so did their behavior. Within minutes after she had read the message expla ining the disconfirmation, Mrs. Keech received another message instructing her to publicize the explanation. She reached for the telephone and began dialing the number of a newspaper. While she was waiting to be connected, someone asked: \"Marian, is th is the first time you have called the newspaper yourself?\" Her reply was immediate: \"Oh yes, this is the first time I have ever called them. I have never had anything to tell them before, but now I feel it is urgent.\" The whole group could have echoed he r feelings, for they all felt a sense of urgency. As soon as Marian had finished her call, the other members took turns telephoning newspapers, wire se rvice, radio stations, and na tional magazines to spread the explanation of the failure of the flood. In their desire to spread the word quickly and resoundingly, the believers now opened for publ ic attention matters that had been thus far utterly secret. Where only hours earlie r they had shunned news paper reporters and felt that the attention they were getting in the press was painful, they now became avid seekers for publicity. (Festinger et al., 1964, p. 170) Not only had the long-standing policies concerning secrecy a nd publicity done an about-face, so too had the group's attitude to ward potential converts. Whereas likely recruits who previously visited the house ha d been mostly ignored, turned away, or treated with casual at tention, the day following the disconfirmation saw a different story. All callers were admitted, all questions were answered, attempts were made to proselyte all such visitors. The member s' unprecedented willingness to accommodate new recruits was perhaps best demonstrated when nine high-school students arrived on the following night to speak with Mrs. Keech. They found her at the telephone deep in a di scussion of flying sauc ers with a caller whom, it later turned out, she believed to be a spaceman. E ager to continue talking to him and at the same time anxious to keep he r new guests, Marian simply included them in the conversation and, for more than an hour , chatted alternately with her guests in the living room and the \"spaceman \" on the ot her end of the telephone. So intent was she on proselyting that she s eemed unable to let any opportunity go by. (Festinger et al., 1964, p. 178) To what can we attribute the believers' ra dical turnabout? Within a few hours, they had moved from clannish and t aciturn hoarders of the Wo rd to expansive and eager "},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"110 Chapter 4 disseminators of it. What could have possessed them to choose such an ill-timed instant—when the failure of the flood was likely to cause nonbelievers to view the group and its dogma as laughable? The crucial event occurred sometime during \"the night of the flood\" when it became increasingly clear that the prophecy would not be fulfilled. Oddly, it was not their prior certainty that drove the member s to propagate the faith, it was an encroaching sense of uncertainty. It was the dawning realization th at if the spaceship and flood predictions were wrong, so might be the entire belief system on which they rested. For those huddled in the Keech living room, that growi ng possibility must have seemed hideous. The group members had gone too far, given up too much for their beliefs to see them destroyed; the shame, the economic cost, th e mockery would be t oo great to bear. The overarching need of the cultists to cling to those beliefs s eeps poignantly from their own words. From a young woman with a 3-year-old child: / have to believe the flood is co ming on the twenty-first because I've spent all my money. I quit my job, I quit computer schoo l. . . . I have to believe, (p. 168) From Dr. Armstrong to one of the research ers four hours after the failure of the saucermen to arrive: I've had to go a long way. I've given up just about everything. I've cut every tie. I've burned every bridge. I've turned my back on th e world. I can't afford to doubt. I have to believe. And there isn't any other truth, (p. 168) Imagine the corner in which Dr. Armstr ong and his followers found themselves as morning approached. So massive was the commit ment to their belief s that no other truth was tolerable. Yet that set of beliefs ha d just taken a merciless pounding from physical reality: No saucer had landed, no spacemen had knocked, no flood had come, nothing had happened as prophesied. Since the only a cceptable form of truth had been undercut by physical proof, there was but one way out of the corner for the group. It had to establish another type of proof for the validity of its beliefs: social proof. This, then, explains their sudden shift from secretive conspirators to zealous missionaries. It also explains the curious tim ing of the shift—precisely when a direct disconfirmation of their beliefs had rendered th em least convincing to outsiders. It was necessary to risk the scorn and derisi on of the nonbelievers because publicity and recruitment efforts provided the only remaini ng hope. If they could spread the Word, if they could inform the uninformed, if they could persuade the sk eptics, and if, by so doing, they could win new converts, their threatened but treasured beliefs would become truer. The principle of social proof says so: The greater the number of people who find any idea correct, the more a given individual will perceive the idea to be "},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Social Proof 111 correct. The group's assignment was clear; since the physical evidence could not be changed, the social evidence had to be . Convince and ye shall be convinced. 4 CAUSE OF DEATH: UNCERTAIN(TY) All the weapons of influence discussed in this book work better under some conditions than under others. If we are to defend ourselv es adequately against any such weapon, it is vital that we know its optimal operating c onditions in order to recognize when we are most vulnerable to its influence. We have already had a hint of one time when the principle of social proof wo rked best with the Chicago believers. It was a sense of shaken confidence that triggered their cravi ng for converts. In general, when we are unsure of ourselves, when the situation is unclear or ambiguous, when uncertainty reigns, we are most likely to look to and accept the actions of others as correct (Tesser, Campbell, & Mickler, 1983; Woolen & Reed, 1998). In the process of examining the reactions of other people to re solve our uncertainty, however, we are likely to overlook a sub tle, but important fact: Those people are probably examining the social evidence, too. Es pecially in an ambi guous situation, the tendency for everyone to be looking to see wh at everyone else is doing can lead to a fascinating phenomenon called pluralistic ignorance. A thorough understanding of the pluralistic ignoran ce phenomenon helps explain a regula r occurrence in our country that has been termed both a riddle and a national disgrace: the failure of entire groups of bystanders to aid victims in agonizing need of help. The classic example of such bystander inacti on and the one that has produced the most debate in journalistic, political, and scientific circles began as an ordinary homicide case in New York City's borough of Queens. A woman in her late twenties, Perhaps because of the quality of ragged desp eration with which they approached their task, the believers were wholly unsuccessful at enlarging their number. Not a single convert was gained. At that point, in the face of the dual failures of physical and social proof, the cult quickly disintegrated. Less than three weeks afte r the date of the predicted flood, group members were scat tered and maintained only sporadic communication with one another. In one final—and ironic—disconfirmation of prediction, it was the movement that perished in the flood. Ruin has not always been the fate of doomsday groups whose predictions proved unsound, however. When such groups have been able to build social proof for their beliefs through effective recr uitment efforts, they have grown and prospered. For example, when the Dutch Anabaptists saw th eir prophesied year of destruction, 1533, pass uneventfully, they became rabid seek ers after converts, pouring unprecedented amounts of energy into the cause. One extr aordinarily eloquent missionary, Jakob van Kampen, is reported to have baptized 100 pe rsons in a single day. So powerful was the snowballing social evidence in support of the Anabaptist position that it rapidly overwhelmed the disconfirming physical ev idence and turned two-thirds of the population of Holland's great cities into adherents. "},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"112 Chapter 4 Catherine Genovese, was killed in a late-night attack on her street as she returned from work. Murder is never an act to be passed o ff lightly, but in a city the size and tenor of New York, the Genovese incident warranted no more space than a fraction of a column in the New York Times. Catherine Genovese's story would have died with her on that day in March 1964 if it hadn't been for a mistake. The metropolitan editor of the Times, A. M. Rosenthal, happened to be having lunch with the city police commissioner a week later. Rosenthal asked the commissioner about a different Queens-based homicide, and the commissioner, thinking he was being questioned about the Genovese case, revealed something st aggering that had been uncovered by the police investigation. It was something that left everyone who heard it, the commissioner included, aghast and gras ping for explanations. Catherine Genovese had not experienced a quick, muffled d eath. It had been a long, loud, tortured, public event. Her assailant had chased and attacked her in the street three times over a period of 35 minutes before his knife finally silenced her cries for help. In credibly, 38 of her neighbors watched from the safety of thei r apartment windows without so much as lifting a finger to call the police. Rosenthal, a former Pulitzer Prize winning re porter, knew a story when he heard one. On the day of his lunch with the commissioner, he assigned a reporter to investigate the \"bystander angle\" of the Genovese incident. Within a week, the Times published a long, front-page article that was to create a swir l of controversy and speculation. The initial paragraphs of that report provided the tone and focus of the story: For more than half an hour 38 respectable, law-abiding citizens in Queens watched a killer stalk and stab a woman in th ree separate attacks in Kew Gardens. Twice the sound of their voices and the sudden glow of their bedroom lights interrupted him and frightened him off. Each time he returned, sought her out, and stabbed her again. Not one person telephoned the police duri ng the assault; one witness called after the woman was dead. That was two weeks ago today. But Assistant Chief Inspector Freder ick M. Lussen, in charge of the borough's detectives and a veter an of 25 years of hom icide investigations, is still shocked. He can give a matter-of-fact recitation of many murders. But the Kew Gardens slaying baffles him—not because it is a murder, but because \"good people\" failed to call the police. (Ganzberg, 1964, p. 7) As with Assistant Chief Inspector Lussen, shock and bafflement were the standard reactions of almost everyone who learned the story's details. The shock struck first, leaving the police, the newspeople, and the reading public stunned. The bafflement followed quickly. How could 38 \"good people\" fail to act under those circumstances? No one could understand it. Even the murder witnesses themselves were "},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Social Proof 113 bewildered. \"I don't know,\" they answered one after another. \"I just don't know.\" A few offered weak reasons for their inaction. For ex ample, two or three pe ople explained that they were \"afraid\" or \"did not want to get involved.\" These reasons, however, do not stand up to close scrutiny: A simple anonym ous call to the polic e could have saved Catherine Genovese without threatening the witne sses' future safety or free time. No, it wasn't the observers' fear or reluctance to complicate their liv es that explained their lack of action; something else was going on th ere that even they could not fathom. Confusion, though, does not make for good news copy. So the press as well as the other media—several papers, TV stations, and magazines that were pursuing follow-up stories—emphasized the only explanation av ailable at the time: The witnesses, no different from the rest of us, hadn't car ed enough to get involved. Americans were becoming a nation of selfish, insensitive people. The rigors of modern life, especially city life, were hardening them. They were becoming \"The Cold Society,\" unfeeling and indifferent to the plight of their fellow citizens. In support of this interpretation, news st ories began appearing regularly in which various kinds of public apathy were detail ed. Also supporting such an interpretation were the remarks of a range of armchair social commentators, who. as a breed, seem never to admit to bafflement when speaking to the press. They, too, saw the Genovese case as having large-scale social significance. All used the word apathy, which, it is interesting to note, had b een in the headline of the Times's front-page story, although they accounted for the apathy differently. One a ttributed it to the e ffects of TV violence, another to repressed aggressi veness, but most implicated the \"deper-sonalization\" of urban life with its \"megalopolitan societies\" and its \"alienation of the individual from the group.\" Even Rosenthal, the newsman who first broke the story and who ultimately made it the subject of a book, subscrib ed to the city-caused apathy theory. Nobody can say why the 38 did not lift the phone while Miss Genovese was being attacked, since they cannot say themselves. It can be assumed, however, that their apathy was indeed one of the bi g-city variety. It is almo st a matter of psychological survival, if one is surrounded and pressed by m illions of people, to prevent them from constantly impinging on you, and the only way to do this is to ignor e them as often as possible. Indifference to one's neighbor and hi s troubles is a conditione d reflex in life in New York as it is in other big ci ties. (A. M. Rosenthal, 1964, pp. 82-83) As the Genovese story grew —aside from Rosenthal's book, it became the focus of numerous newspaper and magazine pieces, several television news documentaries, and an off-Broadway play—it attracted the prof essional attention of a pair of New York- based psychology professors, Bibb Latane and John Darley (1968b). They examined the reports of the Genovese incident and, on the basis of their knowledge of "},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"114 chapter 4 social psychology, hit on what had seemed like the most unlikely explanation of all— the fact that 38 witnesses were present. Pr evious accounts of the story had invariably emphasized that no action was taken, even though 38 individuals had looked on. Latane and Darley suggested that no one had helped precisely because there were so many observers. The psychologists speculated that, for at leas t two reasons, a bysta nder to an emergency will be unlikely to help when there are a number of other bystanders present. The first reason is fairly straightforward. With several potential helpers around, the personal responsibility of each individual is reduced: \"Perhaps someone else will give or call for aid, perhaps someone else already has.\" So with everyone thinking that someone else will help or has helped, no one does. The second reason is the more psychologically intriguing one; it is founded on the principle of social proof and involves the pluralistic ignorance effect Very often an emergency is not obviously an emergency. Is the man lying in the alley a heart-attack victim or a drunk sleeping one off? Is the commotion next door an assault requiring the police or an especially loud marital spat where intervention would be inappropriate and unwelcome? What is going on? In times of such uncertainty, the natural tendency is to look around at the actions of others for clues. We can learn from the way the other witnesses are reacting whether the event is or is not an emergency. What is easy to forget, though, is that everybody else observing the event is likely to be looking for social evidence, too. Because we al l prefer to appear poised and unflustered among others, we are likely to search for that evidence placidly, with brief, camouflaged glances at those around us. Th erefore everyone is likely to see everyone else looking unruffled and failing to act. As a result, and by the principle of social proof, the event will be roundly interpreted as a nonemergency. This, according to Latane and Darley (1968b) is the state of plura listic ignorance \"in which each person decided that since nobody is concerned, nothing is wrong. Meanwhile , the danger may be mounting to the point where a single individual, uninflu enced by the seeming calm of others, would react.\" 5 5 The potentially tragic consequences of the pluralistic ignorance phenomenon are starkly illustrated in a UPI news release from Chicago: A university coed was beaten and strangled in daylight hours near one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city, police said Saturday. The nude body of Lee Alexis Wilson, 23, was found Friday in dense shrubbery alongside the wall of the Art Institute by a 12-year-old boy playing in the bushes. Police theorized she may have been sitting or standing by a fountain in the Art Institute's south plaza when she was atta cked. The assailant apparently then dragged her into the bushes. She apparently wa s sexually assaulted, police said. Police said thousands of persons must have passed the site and one man told them he heard a scream about 2 P.M. but did not inves tigate because no one else seemed to be paying attention."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Social Proof 115 A Scientific Approach The fascinating upshot of Lata ne and Darley's reasoning is that, for an emergency victim, the idea of \"safety in numbers\" may of ten be completely wrong. It might be that someone in need of emergency aid would have a better chance of survival if a single bystander, rather than a crowd, were present. To test this unusual thesis, Darley, Latane, their students, and colleague s performed a systematic an d impressive program of research that produced a clear set of findi ngs (for a review, see Latane & Nida, 1981). Their basic procedure was to stage em ergency events that were observed "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"116 Chapter 4 by a single individual or by a gr oup of people. They then recorded the number of times the emergency victim received help under those circumstances. In their first experiment (Darley & Latane, 1968), a New York college student who appeared to be having an epileptic seizure received help 85 percent of the time when there was a single bystander present but only 31 percent of time with five bystanders present. With almost all the single bystanders helping, it beco mes difficult to argue that ours is \"The Cold Society\" where no one cares for suffering others. Obvi ously it was something about the presence of other bystanders that reduced helping to shameful levels. Other studies have examined the importan ce of social proof in causing widespread witness \"apathy.\" They have done so by pl anting within a group of witnesses to a possible emergency people who are rehearsed to act as if no emer gency were occurring. For instance, in another New York-based experiment (Latane & Darley, 1968a), 75 percent of lone individuals who observed smoke seeping from unde r a door reported the leak; however, when similar leaks were observed by three-person groups, the smoke was reported only 38 percent of the time. The smallest number of bystanders took action, though, when the thr ee-person groups included two individuals who had been coached to ignore the smoke; under those conditions, the leaks were reported only 10 percent of time. In a similar study conduc ted in Toronto (A. S. Ross, 1971), single bystanders provided emergency aid 90 percent of the time, whereas such aid occurred in only 16 percent of the cases when a bystander wa s in the presence of two passive bystanders. Social scientists now have a good idea of when bystanders will offer emergency aid. First, and contrary to the view that we have become a society of callous, uncaring people, once witnesses are convinced that an emergency situation exists, aid is very likely. Under these conditions, the number of bystanders who either intervene themselves or summon help is quite comforting. For example, in four separate experiments done in Florida (R. D. Cl ark & Word, 1972, 1974), accident scenes involving a maintenance man were staged. Wh en it was clear that the man was hurt and required assistance, he was helped 100 percent of the time in two of the experiments. In the other two experiments, where helping i nvolved contact with pot entially dangerous electric wires, the victim still received bys tander aid in 90 percent of the instances. In addition, these extremely high levels of as sistance occurred whether the witnesses observed the event singly or in groups. The situation becomes very different when, as in many cases, bysta nders cannot be sure that the event they are witnessing is an emer gency. Then a victim is much more likely to be helped by a lone bystande r than by a group, especially if the people in the group are strangers to one another (Latane & Rodin, 1969) . It seems that the pluralistic ignorance effect is strongest among strangers: Because we like to look graceful and sophisticated in public and because we are unfamiliar with the reactions of those we do not know, we are unlikely to give off or correctly read expressions of concern when in a group of strangers. Therefore, a possibl e emergency is viewed as a nonemergency and a victim suffers. "},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Social Proof 117 A close look at this set of research findi ngs reveals an enlight ening pattern. All the conditions that decrease an emergency victim's chances for bystander aid exist normally and innocently in the city, in contrast to rural areas: 1. Cities are more clamorous, distracting, rapi dly changing places where it is difficult to be certain of the nature of the events one encounters. 2. Urban environments are more populous; cons equently, people are more likely to be with others when witnessing a potential emergency situation. 3. City dwellers know a much smaller percentage of fe llow residents than do people who live in small towns; therefor e, city dwellers are more li kely to find themselves in a group of strangers when observing an emergency. These three natural characteristics of ur ban environments—their confusion, their populousness, and their low levels of acquainta nceship—fit in very we ll with the factors shown by research to decrease bystander aid. W ithout ever having to resort to such sinister concepts as \"urban depersonalization\" and \"megalop olitan alienation,\" then, we can explain why so many instances of bystander inaction occur in our cities. Devictimizing Yourself Explaining the dangers of modern urban life in less ominous terms does not dispel them. Furthermore, as the world's populations move increasingly to th e cities—half of all humanity will be city dwellers within a decad e—there will be a growing need to reduce those dangers. Fortunately, our newfound und erstanding of the bystander \"apathy\" process offers real hope. Armed with this scientific knowledge, an emergency victim can increase enormously the chances of r eceiving aid from others. The key is the realization that groups of bystanders fail to help beca use the bystanders are unsure rather than unkind. They don't help because they are unsure an emergency actually exists and whether they are responsible for taking action. Wh en they are sure of their responsibilities for in tervening in a clear emergency, pe ople are exceedingly responsive! Once it is understood that the enemy is the simple state of uncertainty, it becomes possible for emergency victims to reduc e this uncertainty, thereby protecting themselves. Imagine, for example, you ar e spending a summer afternoon at a music concert in a park. As the concert ends a nd people begin leaving, you notice a slight numbness in one arm but dismi ss it as nothing to be alar med about. Yet, while moving with the crowd to the distant parking area s, you feel the num bness spreading down to your hand and up one side of your face. Feelin g disoriented, you decide to sit against a tree for a moment to rest. Soon you realize that something is dr astically wrong. Sitting down has not helped; in fact, the contro l and coordination of your muscles has worsened, and you are starting to have di fficulty moving your mouth and tongue to speak. You try to get up but can't. A terr ifying thought rushes to mind: \"Oh, God, I'm having a stroke!\" Groups of people are passi ng by and most are paying no attention. The few who notice the odd way you are sl umped against the tree or the "},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"118 Chapter 4 strange look on your face ch eck the social evidence around them and, seeing that no one else is reacting with concern, walk on convinced that nothing is wrong. Were you to find yourself in such a predicament, what could you do to overcome the odds against receiving help? Because your phys ical abilities would be deteriorating, time would be crucial. If, before you c ould summon aid, you lo st your speech or mobility or consciousness, your chances for assistance and for recovery would plunge drastically. It would be essential to try to request help quickly. What would be the most effective form of that request? Moans, gr oans, or outcries proba bly would not do. They might bring you some attention, but they would not provide enough information to assure passersby that a true emergency exis ted. If mere outcries ar e unlikely to produce help from the passing crowd, perhaps you shou ld be more specific. Indeed, you need to do more than try to gain attention; you s hould call out clearly your need for assistance. You must not allow bystanders to define your situation as a nonemergency. Use the word \"Help\" to show your need for emer gency aid, and don't worry about being wrong. Embarrassment is a villain to be crushed. If you think you are having a stroke, you cannot afford to be worried about the possi bility of overestimating your problem. The difference is that between a moment of em barrassment and possible death or lifelong paralysis. Even a resounding call fo r help is not your mo st effective tactic. Although it may reduce bystanders' doubts that a real emergency ex ists, it will not remove several other important uncertainties with in each onlooker's mind: What kind of aid is required? Should I be the one to provide the aid, or should someone more qualified do it? Has someone else akeady gone to get professional help, or is it my responsibility? While the bystanders stand gawking at you and grappli ng with these questions, time vital to your survival could he slipping away. Clearly, then, as a victim you must do more than alert bystanders to your need for emergency assistance; you must also remo ve their uncertainties about how that assistance should be provided and who shoul d provide it. What would be the most efficient and reliable way to do so? Based on the research findings we have s een, my advice would be to isolate one individual from the crowd: Stare, speak, a nd point directly at that person and no one else: \"You, sir, in the blue jacket, I need help. Ca ll an ambulance.\" With that one utterance you would dispel all the uncertainti es that might prevent or delay help. With that one statement you will have put the man in the blue jacket in the role of \"rescuer.\" He should now understand that emergency aid is needed; he shoul d understand that he, not someone else, is responsible for pr oviding the aid; and, finally, he should understand exactly how to provide it. All the sc ientific evidence indi cates that the result should be quick, effective assistance. In general, then, your best strategy when in need of emergency help is to reduce the uncertainties of those around you concerning y our condition and their responsibilities. Be as precise as possible a bout your need for aid. Do not allow bystanders to come to their own conclusions because, especially in a crowd, the principle of social proof and the consequent pluralistic ignorance e ffect might well cause them to A,"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Social Proof 119 view your situation as a nonemergency. Of a ll the techniques in this book designed to produce compliance with a request, this one is the most important to remember. After all, the failure of your request for emergency aid could mean your life. READER'S REPORT 4.1 From a Woman Living in Wroclaw, Poland I was going through a well-li ghted road crossing when I thought I saw somebody fall into a ditch left by workers. The ditch was we ll protected, and I was not sure if I really saw it—maybe it was just imagination. One year ago, I would continue on my way, believing that people who had been closer saw better. But I had read your book. So, I stopped and returned to check if it was true . And it was. A man fell into this hole and was lying there shocked. The ditch was qu ite deep, so people walking nearby couldn't see anything. When I tried to do somethi ng, two guys walking on this street stopped to help me pull the man out. Today, the newspapers wrote that during the last three weeks of winter, 120 people died in Poland, frozen. This guy could have been 121—that night the temperature was -21C. He should be grateful to your book that he is alive. Author's note: Several years ago, I was involved in a rather serious automobile accident that occurred at an intersection. Bo th I and the other driver were hurt: He was slumped, unconscious, over his steering wheel while I had staggered, bloody, from behind mine. Cars began to roll slowly past us; their drivers gawked but did not stop. Like the Polish woman, I had re ad the book, too; so, I kn ew what to do. I pointed directly at the driver of one car: \"Call the police.\" To a second and third driver: \"Pull over, we need help.\" Not only was their aid ra pid, it was infectious . More drivers began stopping — spontaneously — to tend to the other victim. Th e principle of social proof was working for us now. The trick had been to get the ba ll rolling in the direction of help. Once that was accomplished, social pr oof's natural momentum did the rest. MONKEY ME, MONKEY DO A bit earlier I stated that th e principle of social proof , like all other weapons of influence, works better under some conditi ons than under others. We have already explored one of those condi tions: uncertainty. Without question, when people are uncertain, they are more likely to use others' actions to decide how they themselves should act. In addition, there is another im portant working condition: similarity. The principle of social proof operates most power fully when we are observing the behavior of people just like us (Festinge r, 1954). It is the conduct of such people that gives us the greatest insight into what constitutes co rrect behavior for ourselves. Therefore, "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"120 Chapter 4 we are more inclined to follow the lead of a similar individual than a dissimilar one (Abrams, Wetherell, Cochrane, Hogg, & Turner, 1990; Burn, 1991; Schultz, 1999). That is why I believe we are seeing an increasing number of av erage-person-on-the- street testimonials on TV these days. Adver tisers now know that one successful way to sell a product to ordinary vi ewers (who compose the larges t potential market) is to demonstrate that other \"ordinary\" people like and use it. Whether th e product is a brand of soft drink or a pain reliev er or a laundry detergent, we hear volleys of praise from John or Mary Everyperson. More compelling evidence for the importance of similarity in determining whether we will imitate another's behavior comes from scientific research. An especially apt illustration can be found in a study done by psychologists at Columbia University (Hornstein, Fisch, & Holmes, 1968). The res earchers placed wallets on the ground in various locations around midtow n Manhattan to observe what would happen when they were found. Each wallet contained $2.00 in cash, a $26.30 ch eck, and various information providing the name and address of the wallet's \"owner.\" In addition to these items, the wallet also contained a letter making it evident that the wallet had been lost not once, but twice. The letter was written to the wallet's owner from a man who had found it earlier and whose intention was to return it. The finder indicated in his letter that he was happy to help and that the chance to be of service in this way had made him feel good. It was evident to anyone who found one of these wallets that this well-intentioned individual had then lost the wallet himsel f on the way to the mailbox—the wallet was wrapped in an envelope addressed to the owner. The researchers wanted to know how many people finding such a wallet would follow the lead of the first finder and mail it, intact, to the original owner. Before they dropped the wallets, however, the researchers varied one feature of the letter it contained. So me of the letters were written in standard English by someone who seemed to be an average American, while the other letters were written in broken English by the first finder, who identified himself as a recently arrived foreigner. In other words, the pe rson who had initially found the wallet and had tried to return it was depicted by the letter as being either similar or dissimilar to most Americans. The interesting question was whether the pe ople who found the walle t and letter would be more influenced to mail the wallet if th e first person who had tried to do so were similar to them. The answer was plain: Only 33 percent of the wallets were returned when the first finder was seen to be dissim ilar, but 70 percent were returned when he was thought to be a similar other. These result s suggest an important qualification of the principle of social proof. We will use the acti ons of others to decide on proper behavior for ourselves, especially when we view those others to be similar to ourselves. This tendency applies not only to adults but to children as well. Health researchers have found, for example, that a school-based anti smoking program had la sting effects only when it used same-age peer leaders as teachers (Murray, Leup-ker, Johnson, & Mittlemark, 1984).

I wish I had known about this second study when, a few years before it was publis hed, I was trying to reduce a di fferent kind of anxiety in my son, Chris. I live in Arizona where backyard swimming pools abound. Regrettably, each year, several young children drown after falling into an unattended pool. I was determined, therefore, to teach Chris how to swim at an early age. The problem was not that he was afraid of the water; he loved it, but he w ould not get into the pool without wearing his inflatable inner tube, no matter how I tried to coax, talk, or shame him out of it. After getting nowhere for two months, I hired a grad uate student of mine to help. Despite his background as a lifeguard and swimming instru ctor, he failed as I had. He couldn't persuade Chris to attempt even a stroke out side of his plastic ring. About this time, Chris was attending a day camp that provid ed a number of activities to its group, including the use of a large pool, which he scrupulously avoided. One day, shortly after the graduate student incident, I went to get Chris from camp and, with my mouth agape, watched him run down the diving board and jump into the deepest part of the pool. Panicked, I began pulling off my shoes to jump in to hi s rescue when I saw him bob to the surface and paddle safely to the side of the pool— where I dashed, shoes in hand, to meet him. \"Chris, you can swim!\" I said excitedly. \"You can swim!\" \"Yes,\" he responded casually, \"I learned how today.\" \"This is terrific! This is just terrific,\" I burble d, gesturing expansively to convey my enthusiasm. \"But, how come you didn't need your plastic ring today?\" Looking somewhat embarrassed because his father seemed to be raving while inexplicably soaking his socks in a small puddle and waving his shoes around, Chris explained: \"Well, I'm 3 years old, and Tommy is 3 years old. And Tommy can swim without a ring, so that means I can, too.\" I could have kicked myself. Of course it would be to little Tommy, not to a 6'2\" graduate student, that Chris would look for the most re levant information about what he could or should do. Had I been more thoughtful about solving Chris' swimming problem, I could have employed Tommy's good example earlier and, perhaps, saved myself a couple of frustrating months. I could have simply noted at the day camp that Tommy was a swimmer and then arranged with his parent s for the boys to spend a weekend afternoon swimming in our pool. My guess is that Chris' plastic ring would have been abandoned by the end of the day.

Yet the outcome of the lost-wallet study offers just a hint of the immense imp act that the conduct of similar others has"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"122 Chapter 4 on human behavior. More powerful examples exis t in addition to this one. To my mind, the most telling illustration of this impact starts with a seemingly nonsensical statistic: After a suicide has made front-page news, airplanes—private planes, corporate jets, airliners—begin falling out of the sky at an alarming rate. For example, it has been shown (Phillips, 1979) that immediately following certain kinds of highly publicized suicide stories, the number of people who die in commercial- airline crashes increases by 1,000 percent! Even more alarming: The increase is not limited to airplane deaths. The number of automobile fatalities shoots up as well (Phillips, 1980). What coul d possibly be responsible? One explanation suggests itself immediately: The same social conditions that cause some people to commit suicide cause others to die accidentally. For instance, certain individuals, the suicide-pr one, may react to stressful societal events (economic downturns, rising crime rates, international tensions) by ending it all. Others will react differently to these same events; they might become angry, impatient, nervous, or distracted. To the degree that such people opera te or maintain the cars and planes of our society, the vehicles will be less safe, and c onsequently, we will see a sharp increase in the number of automobile and air fatalities. According to this \"social conditions\" interp retation, then, some of the same societal factors that cause intentional deaths also cause accidental ones, and that is why we find so strong a connection between suicide storie s and fatal crashes. Another fascinating statistic indicates that this is not the correct explanation: Fatal crashes increase dramatically only in those regions where th e suicide has been highly publicized. Other places, existing under similar social conditions, whose newspapers have not publicized the story, have shown no comparable jump in such fatalities. Furthermore, within those areas where newspaper space has been a llotted, the wider the publicity given the suicide, the greater has been the rise in subs equent crashes. Thus, it is not some set of common societal events that stimulates suic ides on the one hand and fatal accidents on the other. Instead, it is the publicized suicide story itself that produces the car and plane wrecks. To explain the strong association between suicide-story publicity and subsequent crashes, a \"bereavement\" account has been suggested. Because, it has been argued, front-page suicides often involve well-known and respected public figures, perhaps their highly publicized deaths throw many people into states of shocked sadness. Stunned and preoccupied, these indivi duals become careless around cars and planes. The consequence is the sharp increase in deadly accidents involving such vehicles that we see after front-page suicide stories. Although the bereavem ent theory can account for the connection between the degree of public ity given a story and subsequent crash fatalities—the more people who learn of the suicide, the larger will be the number of bereaved and carel ess individuals—it cannot explain another startl ing fact: Newspaper stories reporting suicid e victims who died alone produce an increase in the frequency of single-fatality wrecks only, whereas storie s reporting suicide-pl us-murder incidents produce an increase in multiple-fatality wrecks only. Simple bereavement could not cause such a pattern."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Social Proof 123 The influence of suicide stories on car and plan e crashes, then, is fantastically specific. Stories of pure suicides, in which only one person dies, generate wrecks in which only one person dies; stories of suicide-murder combination, in which there are multiple deaths, generate wrecks in which there are multiple deaths. If neither social conditions\" nor \"bereavement\" can make sense of this bew ildering array of tacts, what can? There is a sociologist at the Universi ty of California in San Die go who thinks he has found the answer. His name is David Phillips, and he points a convincing finger at something called the \"Werther effect.\" The story of the Werther effect is both chill ing and intriguing. More than two centuries ago, the great man of German litera ture, Johann von Goethe, published a"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"124 Chapter 4 novel entitled Die Leiden desjungen Werthers (T he Sorrows of Young Wertherj. The book, in which the hero, named Werther, commits suicide, had a remarkable impact. Not only did it provide Goethe with immedi ate fame, but it also sparked a wave of emulative suicides across Europe. So powerful was this effect that authorities in several countries banned the novel. Phillips's own work has traced the Werther effect to mode rn times (Phillips, 1974). His research has demonstrated that, immediat ely following a front-page suicide story, the suicide rate increases dramatically in thos e geographical areas where the story has been highly publicized. It is Phillips's argument that certain troubled people who read of another's self-inflicted death kill themselves in imitation. In a morbid illustration of the principle of social proof, thes e people decide how they shou ld act on the basis of how some other troubled person has acted. Phillips derived his evidence for the modern -day Werther effect from examining the suicide statistics in the United States be tween 1947 and 1968. He f ound that, within two months after every front-page suicide story, an average of 58 more people than usual killed themselves. In a sense, each suicid e story killed 58 people who otherwise would have gone on living. Phillips also found that th is tendency for suicides to beget suicides occurred principally in those parts of the country where the firs t suicide was highly publicized. He observed that the wider the publ icity given the first suicide, the greater the number of later suicides (see Figure 4.1). If the facts surrounding the Werther effect seem to you suspiciously like those surrounding the influence of suic ide stories on air and traffic fatalities, the similarities have not been lost on Phillips, either. In fa ct, he contends that all the excess deaths following a front-page suicide incident can be explained as the same thing: copycat suicides. Upon learning of anot her's suicide, an uncomfortab ly large number of people decide that suicide is an appropriate acti on for themselves as well. Some of these individuals then proceed to commit the act in a straightforward, no-bones-about-it fashion, causing the suic ide rate to jump. Others, however, are less direct. For any of several reasons—to prot ect their reputations, to spare their families the shame and hurt, to allow their dependents to collect on insurance policies—they do not want to appear to have killed themselves. They would rather seem to have died accidentally. So, purposively but furtively, they cause the wreck of a car or a plane they are operating or are simply riding in. This can be accomplished in a variety of all-too-familia r-sounding ways. A commercial airline pilot can dip the nose of the aircraft at a crucial point of takeoff or can inexplicably land on an already occupied runway against the instructions from the control tower; the driver of a car can suddenly swerve into a tree or into oncomin g traffic; a passenger in an automobile or corporate jet can incapacitate the operator, causing the deadly crash; the pilot of a private plane can, despite all radio warnings, plow into another aircraft. Thus, the alarming climb in crash fatalities that we find following front-page suicides is, according to Phillips, most likely due to the We rther effect secretly applied. I consider this insight brilliant. First, it explains all of the data beautifully. If these wrecks really are hidden instances of imitative suicide, it makes sense that we"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Social Proof 125 should see an increase in the wrecks after suic ide stories appear. It makes sense that the greatest rise in wrecks should occur after the su icide stories that have been most widely publicized and have, consequentl y, reached the most people. It also makes sense that the number of crashes should jump appreciably only in those geographical areas where the suicide stories were publicized. It even makes sense that single-"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"126 Chapter 4 victim suicides should lead only to singl e-victim crashes, wh ereas multiple-victim suicide incidents should lead only to multip le-victim crashes. Imitation is the key. In addition, there is a sec ond valuable feature of Phillips's insight. Not only does it allow us to explain the existing facts, it also allows us to predict new facts that had never been uncovered before. For example, if the abnormally frequent crashes following publicized suicides are genuinely the result of imitative rather than accidental actions, they should be more deadly as a result. Th at is, people trying to kill themselves will likely arrange (with a foot on the accelerator instead of the brake, with the nose of the plane down instead of up) for the impact to be as lethal as possible. The consequence should be quick and sure death. When Phil lips examined the reco rds to check on this prediction, he found that the average number of people k illed in a fatal crash of a commercial airliner is more than three times greater if the crash happened one week after a front-page suicide story than if it happened one week before. A similar phenomenon can be found in traffic statistics , where there is evid ence for the deadly efficiency of post-suicide-story auto crashe s. Victims of fatal car wrecks that follow front-page suicide stories die four times more quickly than normal (Phillips, 1980). Still another fascinating predic tion flows from Phillips's idea. If the increase in wrecks following suicide stories truly represents a set of copycat deaths, then the imitators should be most likely to copy the suicides of people who are similar to them. The principle of social proof st ates that we use information about the way others have behaved to help us determine proper conduct for ourselves. As the dropped-wallet experiment showed, we are most influenced in this fashion by the actions of people who are like us. Therefore, Phillips reasoned, if the principl e of social proof is behind the phenomenon, there should be some clear similarity be tween the victim of the highly publicized suicide and those who cause subsequent wrecks. Realizing that the clearest test of this possibility would come from the records of automobile crashes involving a single car and a lone driver, Phillips compared the age of the suicide-story victim with the ages of the lone drivers killed in single-car crashe s immediately after the story appeared in print. Once again the predictions were stri kingly accurate: When the newspaper detailed the suicide of a young person, it was young driver s who then piled thei r cars into trees, poles, and embankments with fatal results; bu t when the news story concerned an older person's suicide, older drivers died in such crashes (Phillips, 1980). This last statistic is the clincher for me. I am le ft wholly convinced and, simu ltaneously, wholly amazed by it. Evidently, the principle of social proof is so wide-ranging and powerful that its domain extends to the fundamental decision for life or death. Phillips's findings illustrate a distressing tendency for suicide publicity to motivate certain people who are similar to the victim to kill themselves—becau se they now find the idea of suicide more legitimate. Truly frightening are the data in dicating that many inno cent people die in the bargain (see Figure 4.2). As if the frightening features of Phillips' s suicide data weren't enough, his additional research (Phillips, 1983) brings more cause for alarm: Homicides in this"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 127"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" 128 Chapter 4 country have a simulated, copycat character after highly publicized acts of violence. Heavyweight championship prize fights that receive coverage on network evening news appear to produce measurable increases in the United States homicide rate. This analysis of heavyweight championship fight s (between 1973 and 1978 ) is perhaps most compelling in its demonstration of the remarkably specific nature of the imitative aggression that is generated. When such a match was lost by a black fighter, the homicide rate during the following 10 days rose significantly for young black male victims but not young white males. On the other hand, when a white fighter lost a match, it was young white men, but not young black men, who were killed more frequently in the next 10 days. When thes e results are combined with the parallel findings in Phillips's suicide data, it is clear that widely publicized aggression has the nasty tendency to spread to similar victims, no matter whether the a ggression is inflicted on the self or on another. Perhaps nowhere are we brought into more dram atic contact with th e unsettling side of the principle of social proof than in the r ealm of copycat crime. Back in the 1970s, our attention was brought to the phenomenon in the form of airplane hijackings, which seemed to spread like airborne viruses. In the 1980s, our focus shifted to product tamperings, such as the famous cases of Tylenol capsules injected with cyanide and Gerber baby food products laced with glass. According to FBI forensic experts, each nationally publicized incident of this sort spawned an average of 30 more incidents (Toufexis, 1993). More recently, we've been jo lted by the specter of contagious mass murders, occurring first in wor kplace settings and then, incr edibly, in the schools of our nation. For instance, immediately followi ng the bloody rampage by two Littleton, Colorado, high-school students on April 20, 199 9, police responded to scores of similar threats, plots, and attempts by troubled students. Two of thos e attempts proved \"successful\": A 14-year-old in Taber, Albert a, and a 15-year-old in Conyers, Georgia, killed or wounded a total of eight classmates within 10 days of the Littleton massacre. Events of this magnitude demand analysis and explanation. Some common thread needs to be identified to make sense of it all. In the case of the workplace murders, observers noticed how often the killing fields were the backrooms of U.S. post offices. So, the finger of blame was pointed at the \"intolerable strains\" of the U.S. postal environment. As for the school-based slaughter, commen tators remarked on an odd commonality: All the affected schools were located in rural or suburban communities rather than in the ever-simmering cauldrons of inner-city neighbor hoods. So, the media in structed us as to the \"intolerable strains\" of growing up in small town or suburban America. By these accounts, the stressors of U.S. post office e nvironments and of small town American life created the explosive reactions of those who worked and lived there. The explanation is straightforward: Similar social conditions beget similar responses. But you and I have been down the \"similar soci al conditions\" road before in trying to understand anomalous patterns of fatalities. Recall how Phillips (1979) considered the possibility that a set of common soci al conditions in a particular en- "},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Social Proof 129 vironment might explain a rash of suicides th ere? It wasn't a satis factory explanation for the suicides; and I don't think it is a satisfa ctory account for the murder sprees, either. Let's see if we can locate a better alternative by first trying to regain contact with reality: The \"intolerable strains\" of work ing at the post office or of living in rural/suburban America!? Come on. Compared to working in the coal mines or compared to living on the gang-ruled, mean streets of inner cities? Come on. Certainly the"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"130 Chapter 4 environments where the mass slaying occurred have their tensions. But they appear no more severe (and often appear less severe) than many othe r environments where such incidents have not taken place. No, the similar social conditions theory doesn't offer a plausible account. Then what does? I'd nod right at the principl e of social proof, which asserts that people, especially when they are unsure of themselves, follow the lead of similar others. Who is more similar to a disgruntled postal employee than another disgruntled postal employee? And who is more similar to troubl ed small town American teenagers than other troubled small town American teenagers? It is a regrettable constant of modern life that many people live their lives in psychol ogical pain. How they deal with the pain depends on numerous factors, one of which is a recognition of how others just like them have chosen to deal with it. As we saw in Phillips's da ta, a highly publicized suicide prompts copycat suicides from similar others—from copies of the cat. I believe the same can be said for a highly publicized multiple murder. As is the case for suicide stories, media officials need to think deep ly about how and how prominently to present reports of killing sprees. Such reports are not only riveting, sensational, and newsworthy, they are malignant. Monkey Island Work like Phillips's helps us appreciate th e awesome influence of the behavior of similar others. Once the enormity of that force is recognized, it becomes possible to understand perhaps the most spectacular act of complia nce of our time—the mass suicide at Jonestown, Guyana. Certain cr ucial features of the event deserve review. The People's Temple was a cultlike organizat ion that was based in San Francisco and drew its recruits from the poor of that city. In 1977, the Reverend Jim Jones—who was the group's undisputed political, social, and spiritual leader— m oved the bulk of the membership with him to a jungle settlement in Guyana, South America. There, the People's Temple existed in relative obscurity until November 18, 1978, when Congressmen Leo R. Ryan of California (w ho had gone to Guyana to investigate the cult), three members of Ryan's fact-finding party, and a cult defector were murdered as they tried to leave Jonestown by plane. Convinced that he would be arrested and implicated in the killings and that the demi se of the People's Temp le would result, Jones sought to control the end of the Temple in his own way. He ga thered the entire community around him and issued a call for each person's death to be done in a unified act of self-destruction. The first response was that of a young woma n who calmly approached the now famous vat of strawberry-flavored poison, administer ed one dose to her baby, one to herself, and then sat down in a field, where she and her child died in convulsions within four minutes. Others followed steadily in turn. Although a handful of Jones-towners escaped and a few others are reported to have resiste d, the survivors claim that the great majority of the 910 people who died did so in an orderly, willful fashion."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Social Proof 131 News of the event shocked us. The broadcas t media and the papers provided a barrage of reports, updates, and analys es. For days, our conversations were full of the topic, \"How many have they found dead now?\" \"A guy who escaped said they were drinking the poison like they were hypnotized or so mething.\" \"What were they doing down in South America, anyway?\" \"It's so hard to believe. What caused it?\" Yes, \"What caused it?\"—the cr itical question. How are we to account for this most astounding of compliant acts? Various explanations have been offered. Some have focused on the charisma of Jim Jones, a man whose style allowed hi m to be loved like a savior, trusted like a father, and treated lik e an emperor. Other explanations have pointed to the kind of people who were attr acted to the People's Temple. They were mostly poor and uneducated individuals who we re willing to give up their freedoms of thought and action for the safety of a place wh ere all decisions would be made for them. Still other explanati ons have emphasized the quasi-rel igious nature of the People's Temple, in which unquestioned faith in the cu lt's leader was assigned highest priority. No doubt each of these features of Jonest own has merit in explaining what happened there, but I do not find them sufficient. After all, the wo rld abounds with cults populated by dependent people who are led by a charisma tic figure. What's more, there has never been a shortage of this comb ination of circumstances in th e past. Yet virtually nowhere do we find evidence of an event even approximating the Jonestown incident among such groups. There must be some thing else that was critical. One especially revealing question gives us a clue: \"If the community had remained in San Francisco, would Reverend Jones's suic ide command have been obeyed?\" A highly speculative question to be sure, but the expe rt most familiar with the People's Temple had no doubt about the answer. Dr. Louis Job/on West, then chairman of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at UCLA and direct or of its neuro-psyc hiatric unit, was an authority on cults who had obs erved the People's Temple for eight years prior to the Jonestown deaths. When interviewed in the immediate aftermath, he made what strikes me as an inordinately instru ctive statement: \"This wouldn't have happened in California. But they lived in total alienation from the re st of the world in a jungle situation in a hostile country.\" Although lost in the welter of commentary following the tragedy, West's observation, together with what we know about the prin ciple of social proof , seems to me quite important to a satisfactory understanding of the compliant suicides. To my mind, the single act in the history of the People's Temp le that most contributed to the members' mindless compliance that day occurred a year earlier with the relocation of the Temple to a jungled country of unfamiliar customs and people. If we are to believe the stories of Jim Jones's malevolent genius, he realized fully the massive psychological impact such a move would have on his followers. All at once, they found themselves in a place they knew nothing about. South America, and the ra in forests of Guyana, especially, were unlike anything they had experienced in San Francisco. The environment—both physical and social—into which they were dropped must have seemed dreadfully uncertain. "},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"132 Chapter 4 Ah, uncertainty—the right-hand man of the pr inciple of social proof. We have already seen that when people are uncertain, they look to the actions of ot hers to guide their own actions. In the alien, G uyanese environment, then, Temple members were very ready to follow the lead of ot hers. As we have also seen, it is others of a special kind whose behavior will be most unquestioningly followed: simi lar others. Therein lies the awful beauty of Reverend Jones's relocati on strategy. In a country like Guyana, there were no similar others for a Jonestown resi dent but the people of Jonestown itself. What was right for a member of the commun ity was determined to a disproportionate degree by what other community members— influenced heavily by Jones— did and believed. When viewed in this light, the terrible orderliness, the lack of panic, the sense of calm with which these people moved to th e vat of poison and to their deaths seems more comprehensible. They hadn't been hypnotized by Jones; they had been convinced—partly by him but, more importantly , by the principle of social proof—that suicide was the correct conduct. Th e uncertainty they surely felt upon "},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Social Proof 133 first hearing the death comm and must have caused them to look around them for a definition of the appropriate response. It is worth particular note that they found two impressive pie ces of social evidence, each pointing in the same directi on. The first was the initial se t of their compatriots, who quickly and willingly took the poison drafts. There will always be a few such fanatically obedient individuals in any strong leader-dom inated group. Whether, in this instance, they had been specially instructed beforeha nd to serve as examples or whether they were just naturally the most compliant w ith Jones's wishes is difficult to know. No matter; the psychological effect of the acti ons of those individua ls must have been potent. If the suicides of similar others in news stories can influe nce total strangers to kill themselves, imagine how enormously mo re compelling such an act would be when performed without hesitation by one's nei ghbors in a place like Jonestown. The second source of social evidence came from the re actions of the crowd itself. Given the conditions, I suspect that what occurred was a large-scale instance of the pluralistic ignorance phenomenon. Each Jonestowne r looked to the actions of surrounding individuals to assess the situation and—f inding calmness because everyone else, too, was surreptitiously assessing rather than re acting—\"learned\" that patient turntaking was the correct behavior. Such misinterpreted, but nonetheless convincing, social evidence, would be expected to result precisely in the ghastly co mposure of the assemblage that waited in the tropics of G uyana for businesslike death. From my own perspective, most attempts to analyze the Jonestown incident have focused too much on the personal qualities of Jim Jones. Although he was without question a man of rare dynamism, the power he wielded strikes me as coming less from his remarkable personal style than from his understanding of fundamental psychological principles. His real genius as a leader was hi s realization of the limitations of individual leadership. No leader can hope to persuade, regularly and single-handedly, all the members of the group. A forceful leader ca n reasonably expect, how ever, to persuade some sizable proportion of group members. Then the raw information that a substantial number of group members has been convinced can, by itself, convince the rest. Thus, the most influential leaders are those w ho know how to arrange group conditions to allow the principle of social proof to work in their favor. It is in this that Jones appears to have been inspired. His masterstroke wa s the decision to move the People's Temple community from urban San Francisco to the remoteness of equatorial South America, where the conditions of uncertain ty and ex-lusive similarity would make the principle of social proof operate for him as perhaps now here else. There a se ttlement of a thousand people, much too large to be held ersistent sway by the force of one man's pe rsonality, could be changed from a following into a herd. As slaughterhouse operators have long known, the mentality of a 1 makes it easy to manage. Simply get some members moving in the desired direction and the others—responding not so much to th e lead animal as to those immediately surrounding them—will peacefully and mechan ically go along. The powers the amazing Reverend Jones, then, are probably best understood not in terms of his dramatic personal style but in his profound knowle dge of the art of social jujitsu."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"134 Chapter 4 DEFENSE I began this chapter with an account of the rela tively harmless practice of laugh tracking and moved on to stories of murder and suicid e—all explained by the principle of social proof. How can we expect to defend ourselv es against a weapon of influence that pervades such a vast range of behavior? The difficulty is compounded by the realization that, most of the time, we don't want to gua rd against the information that social proof provides. The evidence it offers about th e way we should act is usually valid and valuable (Hill, 1982; Laughlin, 1980; Warnik & Sanders, 1980). With it we can cruise confidently through countless de cisions without having to in vestigate the detailed pros and cons of each. In this sens e, the principle of social pr oof equips us with a wonderful kind of automatic pilot device not un like that aboard most aircraft. Yet there are occasional, but real, problem s with automatic pi lots. Those problems appear whenever the flight information lock ed into the control mechanism is wrong. In these instances, we will be taken off course. Depending on the size of the error, the consequences can be severe; but, because the automatic pilot afforded by the principle of social proof is more often an ally than an enemy, we can't be expected to want simply to disconnect it. Thus, we are faced with a classic problem: how to make use of a piece of equipment that simultaneously be nefits and imperils our welfare. Fortunately, there is a way out of the dilemm a. Because the disadvantages of automatic pilots arise principally when incorrect data have been put into the control system, our best defense against these disadva ntages is to recognize when th e data are in error. If we can become sensitive to situations in which the social proof automatic pilot is working with inaccurate information, we can disengage the mechanism and grasp the controls when we need to. Sabotage There are two types of situations in which in correct data cause the principle of social proof to give us poor counsel. The first o ccurs when the social evidence has been purposely falsified. Invariably these situations are manufactured by e xploiters intent on creating the impression —reality be damned—that a multitude is performing the way the exploiters want us to perform. The canned laughter of TV comedy shows is one variety of faked data of this sort, but there is a great deal more, and much of the fakery is strikingly obvious. For instance, canned responses are not unique to the electronic media or even to the electronic age. In fact, the heavy-handed exploi tation of the principle of social proof can be traced through the history of grand opera, one of our most venerable art forms. This is the phenomenon called claquing, said to have begun in 1820 by a pair of Paris opera- house habitues named Sauton and Porcher. The men were more than opera-goers, though. They were businessmen whose product was applause. "},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Social Proof 135 Organizing under the title L'Assurance des Succ es Dramatiques, they leased themselves and their employees to singers and opera ma nagers who wished to be assured of an appreciative audience response. So effec tive were Sauton and Porcher in stimulating genuine audience reaction with their rigged re actions that, before long, claques (usually consisting of a leader— chef de claque —and several individual claqueurs) had become an established and persistent tradition throughout the world of opera. As music historian Robert Sabin (1964) notes, \"By 1830 the cla que was a full-bloom institution, collecting by day, applauding by night, all in the honest open.... But it is altoge ther probable that neither Sauton, nor his ally Porc her, had a notion of the extent to which their scheme of paid applause would be adopted a nd applied wherever opera is sung.\" As claquing grew and devel oped, its practitioners offere d an array of styles and strengths. In the same way that laugh-trac k producers hire indivi duals who excel in titters, chuckles, or belly laughs, the cl aques spawned their own specialists—the pleureuse, chosen for her ability to weep on cue; the bisseur, who called \"bis\" (repeat) and \"encore\" in ecstatic tones; and, in direct kinship with today's laugh-track performer, the rieur, selected for the infecti ous quality of his laugh. For our purposes, though, the most instructiv e parallel to modern forms of canned response is the conspicuous character of th e fakery. No special need was seen to disguise or vary the claque, who often sa t in the same seats, performance after performance, year af ter year, led by a chefde claque two decades into his position. Even the monetary transactions were not hidden from the pub lic. Indeed, one hundred years after the birth of claqui ng, a reader of the London Musical Times could scan the advertised rates of the Italian claqueurs (see Figure 4.3). Whether in the world ofRigoletto or TV sit-coms, then, audiences have been successfully manipulated by those who use social evidence, even when that evidence has been openly falsified. "},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"136 Chapter 4 What Sauton and Porcher realized about th e mechanical way that we abide by the principle of social proof is understood as we ll by a variety of toda y's profiteers. They see no need to hide the manufactured natu re of the social evidence they provide— witness the amateurish quality of the average TV laugh track. They seem almost smug in the recognition of our predicament: Either we must allow them to fool us or we must abandon the precious automatic pilots that make us so vulnerable to their tricks. In their certainty that they have us trapped, howev er, such exploiters have made a crucial mistake. The laxity with which they construct phony social evidence gives us a way to fight back. Because automatic pilots can be engaged and disengaged at will, we can cruise along trusting in the course steered by the principle of social proof until we recognize that inaccurate data are being used. Then we can take the controls, make the necessary correction for the misinformation, and reset the automatic pilot. The transparency of the rigged social proof we get th ese days provides us with exactly the cue we need for knowing when to perform this simple mane uver. With no more cost than a bit of vigilance for plainly counterfeit social evid ence, then, we can protect ourselves nicely. Let's take an example. A bit earlier, I noted the proliferation of average person-on-the- street ads, in which a number of ordinary people speak glowingly of a product, often without knowing that their words are being recorded. As would be expected according to the principle of social proof, these te stimonials from \"average people like you and me\" make for quite effective advertising campaigns. They have always included a relatively subtle kind of dist ortion: We hear only from t hose who like the product; as a result, we get an understandably biased pictur e of the amount of social support for it. More recently, though, a cruder and more uneth ical sort of fals ification has been introduced. Commercial producers often don't bo ther to get genuine testimonials. They merely hire actors to play the roles of average people testifying in an unrehearsed fashion to an interviewer. It is amazing how bald-faced these \"unrehearsed interview\" commercials can be. The situat ions are obviously staged, th e participants are clearly actors, and the dialogue is unmistakably prewritten. I know that whenever I encounter an influence attempt of this sort, it sets off in me a kind of alarm with a clear directive: Attention! Attention! B ad social proof in this situation. Temporarily disc onnect automatic pilot. It's so easy to do. We need only make a conscious decision to be alert to c ounterfeit social evidence. We can relax until the exploiters' evident fakery is spotted, at which time we can pounce. And we should pounce with a vengeance. I am speaking of more than simply ignoring the misinformation, although this defensive tact ic is certainly called for. I am speaking of aggressive counterattack. Whenever possi ble we ought to sting those responsible for the rigging of social evidence. We shoul d purchase no products featured in phony \"unrehearsed interview\" commercials. More over, each manufacturer of the items should receive a letter explaining our response a nd recommending that they discontinue use of the advertising agency that produced so deceptive a presentation of their product. "},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Social Proof 137 Of course, we don't always want to trust th e actions of others to direct our conduct— especially in a situation important enough to warrant our personal investigation of the pros and cons, or one in whic h we are experts—but we do wa nt to be able to count on others' behavior as a source of valid informatio n in a wide range of settings. If we find in such settings that we ca nnot trust the information to be valid because someone has tampered with the evidence, we ought to be re ady to strike back. In such instances, I personally feel driven by more than an aver sion to being duped. I bristle at the thought of being pushed into an unacceptable corner by those who would use one of my hedges against the decisional overload of modern lif e against me. And I get a genuine sense of righteousness by lashing out when they try. If you are like me, so should you. Looking Up In addition to the times when social evidence is deliberately faked, there is another time when the principle of social proof will regularly steer us wrong. In such an "},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"138 Chapter 4 instance, an innocent, natura l error will produce snowballing social proof that pushes us to an incorrect decision. The pluralistic ignorance phenomeno n, in which everyone at an emergency sees no cause for alarm, is one exam ple of this process. The best illustration I know, however, comes from Singapore, where a few years ago, for no good reason, customers of a local bank began drawing out their money in a frenzy. The run on this respected bank remained a mystery until much later, when researchers interviewing participants discovered its peculiar cause: An unexpected bus strike had created an abnormally large crowd waiting at the bus stop in front of the bank that day. Mistaking the gathering for a crush of customers poise d to withdraw their funds from a failing bank, passersby panicked and go t in line to withdraw thei r deposits, which led more passersby to do the same. Soon after opening its doors, the bank was forced to close to prevent a complete crash (\"News,\" 1988). "},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Social Proof 139 This account provides certain insi ghts into the way we respond to social proof. First, we seem to assume that if a lot of people are doing the same thing, they must know something we don't. Especially when we ar e uncertain, we are wi lling to place an enormous amount of trust in the collec tive knowledge of the crowd. Second, quite frequently the crowd is mistaken because its members are not acting on the basis of any superior information but are reacting, themse lves, to the principle of social proof. There is a lesson here: An automatic pilot device, like social proof, should never be trusted fully; even when no saboteur has slipped information into the mechanism, it can sometimes go haywire by itself. We need to check the machine from time to time to be sure that it hasn't worked itself out of sync with the other sources of evidence in the situation—the objective facts, our prior e xperiences, our own judgments. Fortunately, this precaution requires neither much effort nor much time. A quick glance around is all that is needed. And this little precaution is well worth it. The consequences of single- minded reliance on social evidence can be frightening. For instance, a serious international incident developed in 1983 when a Korean Airlines jet strayed deep into Soviet airspace and was shot down by Russian fighters. Subsequent analysis determined that during the flight, the jetliner's crew had never checked their progress manually, relying entirely on thei r autopilot, which had been fe d the wrong magnetic heading at the flight's outset (Staff, 1993). Certainly, a flier whose plane is locked into automatic pilot would be wise to glance occasionally at the instrument panel and out the window. In the same way, we need to look up and around periodically whenever we ar e locked into the ev idence of the crowd. Without this simple safeguard against misgui ded social proof, our outcomes might well run parallel to those of the Korean Ai rliner and the Singa pore bank: crash. READER'S REPORT 4.2 From a Former Racetrack Employee I became aware of one method of faking soci al evidence to one's advantage while working at a racetrack. In order to lower the odds and make more money, some bettors are able to sway the public to bet on bad horses. Odds at a racetrack are based on where the money is being bet. The more money on a horse, the better the odds. Ma ny people who play the horse s have surprisingly little knowledge of racing or betting strategy. Thus, especially when they don't know much about the horses in a particular race, a lo t of times they'll simply bet the favorite. Because tote boards display up-to-the-minut e odds, the public can always tell who the current favorite is. The system that a high ro ller can use to alter the odds is actually quite simple. The guy has in mind a horse he feels has a good chance of winning. Next he chooses a horse that has long odds (say, 15 to 1) and doesn't have a realistic chance to win. The minute the mutual windows open, the guy puts down $100 on the inferior horse, creating an instant favorite whose odds on the board drop to about 2 to 1. "},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"140 Chapter 4 Now the elements of social proof begin to work. People who are uncertain of how to bet the race look to the tote board to see which horse the early bettors have decided is a favorite, and they follow. A snowballing effect now occurs as other people continue to bet the favorite. At this point, the high rolle r can go back to the window and bet heavily on his true favorite, which will have better odds now because the \"new favorite\" has been pushed down the board. If the guy wins, th e initial $100 investme nt will have been worth it many times over. I've seen this happen myself. I remember one time a person put down $100 on a pre- race 10 to 1 shot, making it the early favorite . The rumors started circulating around the track—the early bettors knew something. Next thing you know, everyone (myself included) was betting on this horse. It e nded up running last and had a bad leg. Many people lost a lot of money. Somebody came out ahead, though. We'll never know who. But he is the one with all the money. He understood the theory of social proof. Author's note: Once again we can see that social pr oof is most telling for those who feel unfamiliar or unsure in a specific situation and who, consequently, must look outside of themselves for evidenc e of how best to behave there. SUMMARY • The principle of social proof states that one important means that people use to decide what to believe or how to act in a situation is to look at what other people are believing or doing there. Powerful imitative effects have been found among both children and adults and in such diverse activities as purchase decisions , charity donations, and phobia remission. The principle of social proof can be used to stimulate a person's compliance with a request by informing the person that ma ny other individuals (the more, the better) are or have been complying with it. • Social proof is most influential under two conditions. The first is uncertainty. When people are unsure, when the situation is ambi guous, they are more likely to attend to the actions of others and to accept those actions as correct. In ambiguous situations, for instance, the decisions of bysta nders to help are much more influenced by the actions of other bystanders than when the situation is a clear-cut emergency. The second condition under which social proof is most influential is similarity: People ar e more inclined to follow the lead of similar others. Evidence for the powerful effect of the actions of similar others on human behavior can be read ily seen in the suicide statistics compiled by sociologist David Phillips. Those statisti cs indicate that af ter highly publicized suicide stories other troubled individuals, who are similar to the suicide-story victim, decide to kill themselves. An analysis of the mass suicide incident at Jonestown, Guyana, suggests that the group's leader, Reverend Jim Jones, used both of the "},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Social Proof 141 factors of uncertainty and similarity to induce a herdlike suicide response from the majority of the Jonestown population. Recommendations to reduce our susceptibility to faulty social proof include a sensitivity to clearly counterfeit eviden ce of what similar others ar e doing and a recognition that the actions of similar others should not form the sole basis for our decisions.

What migh t be startling to note, however, is that this simple rule is used in hundreds of ways by total strangers to get us to comply with their requests. The clearest illustration I know of the professional exploitati on of the liking rule is the Tupperware party, which I consider a cla ssic compliance setting. Anybody familiar with the workings of a Tupperware party will r ecognize the use of the various weapons of influence we have examined so far: • Reciprocity. To start, games are played and prizes won by the party goers; anyone who doesn't win a prize gets to choose one from a grab bag so that everyone has received a gift before the buying begins. • Commitment. Participants are urged to describe publicly the uses and benefits they have found for the Tupperw are they already own. • Social proof. Once the buying begins, each purchase build s the idea that other, similar people want the products; th erefore, it must be good. All the weapons of influence are present to he lp things along, but the real power of the Tupperware party comes from a particular a rrangement that trades on the liking rule. Despite the entertaining and persuasive selling skills of the Tupperware demonstrator, the true request to purchase the product does not come from this stranger; it comes from a friend to every person in the room. Oh, the Tupperware re presentative may physically ask for each party goer's order, all right ; but the more psychologically compelling requester is sitting off to the side, smiling, ch atting, and serving refreshments. She is the party hostess, who has called her friends toge ther for the demonstration in her home and who, everyone knows, makes a profit from each piece sold at the party. By providing the hostess with a percentage of the take, the Tupperware Home Parties Corporation arranges for its customers to buy fr om and for a friend rather than from an unknown salesperson. In this way, the attr action, the warmth, the security, and the obligation of friendship are brought to bear on the sales setting (Tay lor, 1978). In fact, consumer researchers who have examined th e social ties between the hostess and the party goers in home party sale s settings have affirmed the power of the company's approach: The strength of that social bond is twice as likely to determine product purchase as is preference fo r the product itself (Frenzen & Davis, 1990). The results have been remarkable. It was recently estimated that Tupperware sales now exceed 2.5 million dollars a day! Indeed, Tupperware's success has spread around the world to societies in Europe, Latin America, and Asia , where one's place in a network of friends and family is more socially significant than in the United States (Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 1995). As a result, now less th an a quarter of Tupperware sales take place in North America. 144 "},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Liking 145 What is interesting is that the customers appear to be fully aware of the liking and friendship pressures embodied in the Tuppe rware party. Some don't seem to mind; others do, but don't seem to know how to a void these pressures. One woman I spoke with described her reactions with more th an a bit of frustra tion in her voice. It's gotten to the point now wh ere I hate to be invited to Tupperware parties. I've got all the containers I need; and if I wanted any more, I could buy another brand cheaper in the store. But when a friend calls up, I feel li ke I have to go. And when I get there, I feel like I have to buy something. What c an I do? It's for one of my friends. With so irresistible an ally as friends hip, it is little wonde r that the Tupperware Corporation has abandoned retail sales outle ts and is pushing the home party concept. Statistics reveal that a Tupperware party now starts somewhere every 2.7 seconds. Of course, all sorts of other compliance professi onals recognize the pressure to say yes to someone we know and like. Take, for instance, the growing number of charity organizations that recruit volunteers to canvass for donations close to their own "},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"146 Chapters homes. They understand perfectly how much mo re difficult it is for us to turn down a charity request when it comes from a friend or neighbor. Other compliance professionals have found that the friend doesn't even have to be present to be effective; often, just the mention of the friends' name is enough. The Shaklee Corporation, which specializes in door-to-door sales of various home-related products, advises its salespeople to use the \"endless chain\" method for finding new customers. Once a customer admits that he or she likes a product, that customer can be pressed for the names of friends who woul d also appreciate learning about it. The individuals on that list can then be approached for sales and a list of their friends, who can serve as sources for still other potential customers, and so on in an endless chain. The key to the success of this method is that each new prospect is visited by a salesperson armed with the name of a frie nd \"who suggested I call on you.\" Turning the salesperson away under those circumstances is difficult; it's almost like rejecting the friend. The Shaklee sales manual insists that employees use this system: \"It would be impossible to overestimate its value.

She told me that one of my buddies had placed my name on something called the \"MCI Friends and Family Calling Circle.\" This friend of mine, Brad, is a guy I grew up with but w ho moved to New Jersey last year for a job. He still calls me pretty regula rly to get the news on the guys we used to hang out with. The saleswoman told me that he could save 20 percen t on all the calls he made to the people on his Calling-Circle list, provided they are MCI phone company subscribers. Then she asked me if I wanted to switch to MCI to get all the blah, blah, blah benefits of MCI service, and so that Brad could save 20 per cent on his calls to me. Well, I couldn't have cared less about the bene fits of MCI service; I was perfectly happy with the long distance company I had. But th e part about wanting to save Brad money on our calls really got to me. For me to say that I didn't want to be in his Calling Circle and didn't care about saving him money woul d have sounded like a real affront to our friendship when he heard about it. So, to avoid insulting him, I told her to switch me to MCI. I used to wonder why women would go to a Tupperware Party just because a friend was holding it, and then buy stuff they didn't wa nt once they were there. I don't wonder anymore. Author's note: This reader is not alone in being able to testify to the power of the pressures embodied in MCI's Calling Circle idea. When Consumer Reports magazine inquired into the practice, the MCI salesperson they interviewed was quite succinct: \"It works 9 out of 10 times,\" he said. MAKING FRIENDS TO INFLUENCE PEOPLE Compliance practitioners' widespread use of the liking bond between friends tells us much about the power of the liking rule to produce assent. In fact, we find that such professionals seek to benefit from the rule even when already formed friendships are not present for them to employ. Under these circ umstances, the professionals still make use of the liking bond by employing a compliance strategy that is qui te direct: They first get us to like them. There is a man in Detroit, Joe Girard, who sp ecialized in using the liking rule to sell Chevrolets. He became wealthy in the process, making over $200,000 a year. "},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"148 Chapters With such a salary, we might guess that he was a high-level GM executive or perhaps the owner of a Chevrolet dealership. But no. He made his money as a salesman on the showroom floor. He was phenomen al at what he did. For twel ve years stra ight, he won the title of \"Number One Car Salesman\"; he averaged more than five cars and trucks sold every day he worked; and he has been called the world's \"greatest car salesman\" by the Guinness Book of World Records. For all his success, the formula he employed was surprisingly simple. It consisted of offering people just two things : a fair price and someone th ey liked to buy from. \"And that's it,\" he claimed in an interview. \"Finding the salesman you like, plus the price. Put them both together, and you get a deal.\" Fine. The Joe Girard formula tells us how vita l the liking rule is to his business, but it doesn't tell us nearly enough. For one thing, it doesn't tell us why customers liked him more than some other salesperson who offe red a fair price. Th ere is a crucial—and fascinating—general question that Joe's formula leaves unanswered. What are the factors that cause one person to like another? If we knew that answer, we would be a long way toward understanding how people such as Joe can so successfully arrange to have us like them and, conversely, how we mi ght successfully arrange to have others like us. Fortunately, social scientists have been asking this question for decades. Their accumulated evidence has allowed them to id entify a number of factors that reliably cause liking. As we will see, each is clever ly used by compliance professionals to urge us along the road to \"yes.\" WHY DO I LIKE YOU? LE T ME LIST THE REASONS Physical Attractiveness Although it is generally acknow ledged that good-looking pe ople have an advantage in social interaction, recent findings indicate th at we may have sorely underestimated the size and reach of that advantage. There seems to be a click, whirr response to attractive people. Like all click, whirr reactions, it happens automati cally, without forethought. The response itself falls into a cate gory that social scientists call halo effects. A halo effect occurs when one positive characteristic of a person dominates the way that person is viewed by others. The evid ence is now clear that physical attractiveness is often such a characteristic. Research has shown that we automatica lly assign to good-looking individuals such favorable traits as talent, kindness, honesty, and intelligence (for a review of this evidence, see Eagly, Ashmore, Makhijani , & Longo, 1991). Furthermore, we make these judgments without being aware that phys ical attractiveness pl ays a role in the process. Some consequences of this uncons cious assumption that \"good-looking equals good\" scare me. For example, a study of the 1974 Canadian federal elections found that attractive candidates received more than two and a half times as many votes as unattractive candidates (Efran & Patterson, 1976 ). Despite such evidence of favoritism toward handsome politicians, follow-up research demon- "},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Liking 149 strated that voters did not realize their bi as. In fact, 73 percent of Canadian voters surveyed denied in the strongest possible term s that their votes had been influenced by physical appearance; only 14 percent even allowed for the possibility of such influence (Efran & Patterson, 1976). Voters can deny the impact of a ttractiveness on electability all they want, but evidence has continued to confirm its troubling presence (Budesheim & DePaola, 1994). A similar effect has been found in hiring situations. In one study, good grooming of applicants in a simulated employment in terview accounted for more favorable hiring decisions than did job qualifications—this, even though the interviewers claimed that appearance played a small ro le in their choices (Mack & Rainey, 1990). The advantage given to attractive workers extends past hiring day to payday. Economists examining U.S. and Canadian samples have found that at tractive individuals get paid an average of 12-14 percent more than their unattractive coworkers (Ham-mermesh & Biddle, 1994). Equally unsettling research indi cates that our judicial process is similarly susceptible to the influences of body dimensions and bone st ructure. It now app ears that good-looking people are likely to receive highly favorab le treatment in the legal system (see Castellow, Wuensch, & Moore, 1991; a nd Downs & Lyons, 1990, for reviews). For example, in a Pennsylvania study (Stewa rt, 1980), researchers rated the physical attractiveness of 74 separate male defendants at the start of their criminal trials. When, much later, the researchers checked court r ecords for the results of these cases, they found that the handsome men had received si gnificantly lighter sentences. In fact, attractive defendants were twice as likely to avoid jail as unattractive defendants. 1 In another study—this one on the damages aw arded in a staged negligence trial—a defendant who was better looking than his victim was assessed an average amount of $5,623; but when the victim was more attractive of the two, 'This finding—that attractive defendants, ev en when they are found guilty, are less likely to be sentenced to prison—helps explain one fascinating experiment in criminology (Kurtzburg, Safar, & Cavior, 1968) . Some New York City jail inmates with facial disfigurements underwen t plastic surgery while incarc erated; other inmates with similar disfigurements did not. Furthermor e, some members of each group received services (such as counseling, tr aining, etc.) designed to rehab ilitate them to society. One year after the inmates had been released from jail, a check of the records revealed that (except for heroin addicts) criminals given the cosmetic surgery were significantly less likely to have returned to jail. The most interesting feature of this finding was that it was equally true for those inmates who had not received the traditional rehabilitative services and for those who had. Apparently, so me criminologists then argued that when it comes to ugly inmates, prisons would be be tter off to abandon the costly rehabilitation services they typically provide and offer plas tic surgery instead; the surgery seems to be at least as effective and decidedly less expensive. The importance of the Pennsylvania data (Ste wart, 1980) is that it suggests that the argument for surgery as a means of rehabil itation may be faulty. Making ugly criminals more attractive may not reduce the chances th at they will commit another crime; it may only reduce their chances of being sent to jail for it."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"150 Chapter 5 the average compensation was $10,051. What's more, both male and female jurors exhibited the attractiveness-based favoritism (Kulka & Kessler, 1978). Other experiments have demonstrated that attractive people are more likely to obtain help when in need (Benson, Karabenic, & Lerner, 1976) and are more persuasive in changing the opinions of an audience (Cha iken, 1979). Here, too, both sexes respond in the same way. In the Benson et al. study on helping, for instance, the better-looking men and women received aid more often, even from members of their own sex. A major exception to this rule might be expected to occur, of course, if the attractive person is viewed as a direct competitor, especially a romantic rival. Short of this qualification, though, it is apparent that good-looking people enjoy an enormous social advantage in our culture. They are better liked, more persuasive, more fr equently helpe d, and seen as possessing more desirable persona lity traits and greater intell ectual capacities. It appears that the social benefits of good looks begin to accumulate quite early. Research on elementary school children shows that adults view aggressive acts as less naughty when performed by an attractive child (Dion, 1972) and that teachers presume good-looking children to be more intelligent than their le ss attractive classmates (Ritts, Patterson, & Tubbs, 1992). It is hardly any wonder, th en, that the halo of physical attractiveness is regularly exploited by compliance professionals. Becau se we like attractive people, and because we tend to comply with those we like, it makes sense that sales training programs include grooming hints, fashi onable clothiers select their floor staffs from among the good-looking candidates, and con men and women are attractive. 2 Similarity What if physical appearance is not much at issue? After all, most people possess average looks. Are there other factors that can be used to produce liking? As both researchers and compliance professionals know, there are several, and one of the most influential is similarity. We like people who are similar to us (Byrne, 1971). This fact seems to hold true whether the similarity is in the area of opinions, personality traits, background, or lifestyle. Consequently, those who want us to like them so that we will comply with 2 Have you ever noticed that despite their good looks, many attractive people don't seem to share the positive impressions of their pers onalities and abilities that observers have? Research has not only confirmed the tenuous and inconsistent relationship between attractiveness and self-esteem (see Adam s, 1977), it has also offered a possible explanation. One set of authors has pr oduced evidence suggesting that good-looking people are aware that other people's positive evaluations of them are not based on their actual traits and abilities but are often caused by an attractiveness \"halo\" (Major, Carrington, & Carnevale, 1984). Consequently, many attractive people who are exposed to this confusing information may be left with an uncertain self-concept. "},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Liking 151 them can accomplish that purpose by appearing si milar to us in a wide variety of ways. Dress is a good example. Several studies have demonstrated that we are more likely to help those who dress like us. In one study, done in the early 1970s when young people tended to dress in either \"hippie\" or \"s traight\" fashion, experimenters donned hippie or straight attire and as ked college students on campus fo r a dime to make a phone call. When the experimenter was dressed in the same way as the student, the request was granted in more than two-thirds of the inst ances; when the student and requester were dissimilarly dressed, the dime was provided less than half the tim e (Emswiller, Deaux, & Willits, 1971). Another experiment showed how automatic our positive response to similar others can be. Marchers in an an tiwar demonstration were found to be more likely to sign the petition of a similarly dressed requester and to do so without bothering to read it first (Suedfeld, Bochner, & Matas, 1971). Click, whirr. Another way requesters can manipulate similari ty to increase liking and compliance is to claim that they have backgrounds and inte rests similar to ours. Car salespeople, for example, are trained to look for evidence of such things while examining a customer's trade-in. If there is camping gear in the trunk, the salespeople might mention, later on, how they love to get away from the city when ever they can; if there are golf balls on the back seat, they might remark that they hope the rain will hold off until they can play the eighteen holes they scheduled for later in the day; if they notice that the car was purchased out of state, they might ask wh ere a customer is from and report—with surprise—that they (or their spouse) were born there, too. As trivial as these similarities may seem, th ey appear to work (Brewer, 1979; Tajfel, 1981). One researcher who examined the sale s records of insurance companies found that customers were more likely to buy insurance when a salesperson was like them in age, religion, politics, and cigarette-smoki ng habits (Evans, 1963). Another researcher was able to significantly increase the percen tage of people who re sponded to a mailed survey by changing one small feature of the re quest: On a cover letter, he modified the name of the survey-taker to be similar to that of the survey re cipient. Thus, Robert Greer received the survey from a survey center official named Bob Gregar while Cynthia Johnston received hers from a surv ey center official na med Cindy Johanson. In two separate studies, adding this little bit of sim ilarity to the exch ange nearly doubled survey compliance (Garner, 1999). These se emingly minor commonalties can affect decisions that go well be yond whose insurance to purch ase or whose survey to complete. They can affect the decision of w hose life to save. When asked to rank-order a waiting list of patients su ffering from kidney disorder as to their deservingness for the next available treatment, people chose those whose political party preference matched their own (Furnham, 1996). Because even small similarities can be e ffective in producing a positive response to another and because a veneer of similari ty can be so easily manufactured, I would "},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"152 Chapters advise special caution in the presence of requesters who claim to be \"just like you.\" 3 Indeed, it would be wise these days to be careful around salespeople who just seem to be just like you. Many sales trai ning programs now urge trainees to \"mirror and match\" the customer's body posture, mood, and verbal styl e, as similarities along each of these dimensions have been shown to lead to positive results (Chartrand & Bargh, 1999; Locke & Horowitz, 1990; Woodside & Davenport, 1974). Compliments Actor McLean Stevenson once described how hi s wife tricked him into marriage: \"She said she liked me.\" Although designed for a lau gh, the remark is as instructive as it is humorous. The information that someone fa ncies us can be a bewitchingly effective device for producing return liking and willing compliance (Berscheid & Walster, 1978; Howard, Gengler, & Jain, 1995, 1997). So, often wh en people flatter us or claim affinity for us, they want something from us. Remember Joe Girard, the world's \"greatest ca r salesman,\" who says the secret of his success was getting customers to like him? He did something that, on the face of it, seems foolish and costly. Each month he se nt every one of his more than 13,000 former customers a holiday greeting card containing a printed message. The holiday greeting card changed from month to month (Ha ppy New Year, Happy Valentine's Day, Happy Thanksgiving, and so on), but the message pr inted on the face of the card never varied. It read, \"I like you.\" As Joe explained it, \"T here's nothing else on the card, nothin' but my name. I'm just telling 'em that I like 'em.\" \"I like you.\" It came in the mail every year , 12 times a year, lik e clockwork. \"I like you,\" on a printed card that went to 13,000 ot her people, too. Could a statement of liking so impersonal, obviously designed to sell cars, really work : Joe Girard thought so, and a man as successful as he was at what he did deserves our attention. Joe understood an important fact about human nature: we are phenomenal suckers for flattery. Although there are limits to our gullibility—especially when we can be sure that the flatterer is trying to manipulat e us (Jones & Wortman, 1973)—we tend, as a rule, to believe praise and to like those who provide it, often when it is probably untrue (Byrne, Rasche, & Kelley, 1974). An experiment done on a group of men in North Carolina shows how helpless we can be in the face of praise. The men in the study received comments about themselves from another person who needed a favor from them. Some of the men got only positive comments, some got only negative comments, and some got a mixture of good and bad. There were three interesting findings. First, the evaluator who pr ovided only praise was liked best by the men. Second, this tendency held true even when Additional work suggests yet another reason for caution wh en dealing with similar requesters: we typically undere stimate the degree to which si milarity affects our liking for another (Gon-zales, Davis, Loney, Lukens, & Junghans, 1983). "},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Liking 153 the men fully realized that the flatterer st ood to gain from their liking him. Finally, unlike the other types of comm ents, pure praise did not have to be accurate to work. Positive comments produced just as much likin g for the flatterer when they were untrue as when they were true (Drachman, deCarufel, & Insko, 1978). Apparently we have such an automatically positive reaction to compliments that we can fall victim to someone who uses them in an obvious attempt to win our favor. Click, whirr. When seen in this light, the expense of printing and mailing well over 150,000 \"I like you\" cards each year seems neither as foolish nor as costly as before. "},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"154 Chapters Contact and Cooperation For the most part, we like things that are familiar to us (Zajonc, 1968). To prove the point to yourself, try a litt le experiment. Get the negativ e of an old photograph that shows a front view of your face and have it developed into a pair of pictures—one that shows you as you actually look and one that shows a revers e image (so that the right and left sides of your face ar e interchanged). Now decide which version of your face you like better and ask a good friend to make the choice, too. If you are at all like the group of Milwaukee women on whom this procedure was tried, you should notice something odd: Your friend will prefer the tr ue print, but you will prefer the reverse image. Why? Because you both will be responding favorably to the more familiar face—your friend to the one th e world sees and you to the transposed one you find in the mirror every day (Mita, Dernier, & Knight, 1977). Because of its effect on liking, familiarity plays a role in decisions about all sorts of things, including the politicians we elect (Grush, 1980; Grush, McKeough, & Ahlering, 1978). It appears that in an election boot h voters often choose a candidate merely because the name seems familiar. In one cont roversial Ohio election a few years ago, a man given little chance of wi nning the state attorney-gener al race swept to victory when, shortly before the election, he change d his name to Brown—a family name of much Ohio political tradition. How could such a thing happen? The answer li es partially in the unconscious way that familiarity affects liking. Often we don't rea lize that our attitude toward something has been influenced by the number of times we have been exposed to it in the past. For example, in one experiment, the faces of seve ral individuals were fl ashed on a screen so quickly that, later on, the subjects who were e xposed to the faces in this manner couldn't recall having seen any of them before. Yet, the more frequently a person's face was flashed on the screen, the more these subjects came to like that person when they met in a subsequent interaction. And because greate r liking leads to greate r social influence, these subjects were also more persuaded by the opinion statements of the individuals whose faces had appeared on the screen most frequently (Bornstein, Leone, & Galley, 1987). On the basis of evidence that we are more favorably disposed toward the things we have had contact with, some people have recomm ended a \"contact\" approach to improving race relations. They argue that, simply by providing individuals of different ethnic backgrounds with more exposure to one anot her as equals, those individuals will naturally come to like each ot her better. However, when scientists have examined school integration—the area offe ring the single best test of the contact approach—they have discovered quite the opposite pattern. School desegregation is more likely to increase prejudice between blacks and whites than to decrease it (Stephan, 1978). Let's stay with the issue of school desegregation for a wh ile. However well in-tentioned the proponents of interracial harmony through simple contact are, their approach is unlikely to bear fruit because the argument on which it is ba sed is terribly misinformed (Gerard, 1983; Maruyama, Miller, & Ho ltz, 1986). First of all, research"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Liking 155 has shown that the school setting is not a melting pot where children interact as readily with members of other ethnic groups as th ey do with their own. Years after formal school integration, there is litt le social integration. The stude nts clot together ethnically, separating themselves, for the most part , from other groups (Rogers, Hen-nigan, Bowman, & Miller, 1984; Oskamp & Schultz , 1998). Second, even if there were much more interethnic interaction, research s hows that becoming familiar with something through repeated contact doesn't necessarily cause greater liking (Gaer t-ner et al., 1999). In fact, continued exposure to a person or object under unpleasant conditions such as frustration, conflict, or competition leads to less liking (Burgess & Sales, 1971; Swap, 1977; Zajonc, Markus, & Wilson, 1974). The typical American classroom fosters precisely these unpleasant conditions. Consider the illuminating report of psychologi st Elliot Aronson, called in to consult with school authorities on problems in the Aus tin, Texas, schools. His description of the way he found education proceeding in the sta ndard classroom could apply to nearly any public school in the United States: In general, here is how it works: The teacher stands in front of the class and asks a question. Six to ten children strain in th eir seats and wave their hands in the teacher's face, eager to be called on and show how smart they are. Several others sit quietly with eyes averted, trying to become invisible. Wh en the teacher calls on one child, you see looks of disappointment and di smay on the faces of the ea ger students, who missed a chance to get the teacher's approval; and you will see relief on the faces of the others who didn't know the answer.... This game is fie rcely competitive and the stakes are high, because the kids are competing for the love and approval of one of the two or three most important people in their world. Further, this teaching process guarantees that the children will not learn to like and understand each other. Conjure up your own exp erience. If you knew the right answer and the teacher called on someone else, you probably hoped that he or she would make a mistake so that you would have a chance to display your knowledge. If you were called on and failed, or if you didn 't even raise your hand to compete, you probably envied and resented your cla ssmates who knew the answer. Children who fail in this system become jealous and rese ntful of the succe sses, putting them down as teacher's pets or even resorting to violence against them in the school yard. The successful students, for their part, often hold the unsu ccessful children in contempt, calling them \"dumb\" or \"stupid.\" (Aronson, 1975, pp. 44, 47) Should we wonder, then, why strict school desegregation—whethe r by enforced busing, district rezoning, or school cl osures—so frequently produ ces increased rather than decreased prejudice? When our children find their pleasant soci al and friendship contacts within their ethnic boundaries and ge t repeated exposure to other groups only in the competitive cauldron of the classroom, we might expect as much. "},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"156 Chapters Are there available solutions to this probl em? One possibility might be to end our attempts at school integrati on, but that hardly seems work able. Even if we were to ignore the inevitable legal and constitutional challenges and the disruptive societal wrangle such a retreat would provide, ther e are solid reasons for pursuing classroom integration. For instance, although white stude nts' achievement levels remain steady, it is 10 times more likely that the academic performance of minority students will significantly increase rather than significan tly decline after dese gregation (Stephan, 1978). We must be cautious in our approach to sc hool desegregation so that we do not throw out the baby with the bath water. The idea, of course, is to jettison just the water, leaving the baby shining from the bath. Ri ght now, though, our baby is soaking in the Schmutzwasser of increased racial hostility. Fortuna tely, real hope for draining away that hostility is emerging from the research of education specialists into the concept of \"cooperative learning.\" Because much of th e heightened prejudice from classroom desegregation seems to stem from increased exposure to outside group members as rivals, these educators have experimented with forms of learning in which cooperation rather than competition with classmates is central. Off to Camp To understand the logic of the cooperative approach, it helps to reexamine the fascinating, four-decade-old res earch program of Turkish-born social scientist Muzafer Sherif and his colleagues (Sherif, Harvey, White, Hood, & Sherif, 1961 ). Intrigued with the issue of intergroup conflict, the research team decided to investigate th e process as it developed in boys' summer camps. Although th e boys never realized that they were participants in an experiment, Sherif and hi s associates consistently engaged in artful manipulations of the camp's social envi ronment to observe the effects on group relations. What the researchers learned is th at it didn't take much to bring on certain kinds of ill will. Simply separating the boys into two residence cabins was enough to stimulate a \"we versus they\" feeling between the groups; le tting the boys assign names to the two groups (the Eagles and the Rattlers) accelerated the sense of rivalry. The boys soon began to demean the qualities and accomplishments of the other group; however, these forms of hostility were minor compared to what occurred when the experimenters purposely introduced competitive activities into the groups' meetings with one another. Cabin-against-cabin treasure hunts, tugs-of- war, and athletic contests produced name- calling and confrontations. During the comp etitions, members of the opposing team were labeled \"cheaters,\" \"sneaks,\" and \"sti nkers.\" Afterward, cabins were raided, rival banners were stolen and burne d, threatening signs were post ed, and lunchroom scuffles were commonplace. At this point, it was evident to Sherif that the recipe for disharmony was quick and easy: just separa te the participants into groups and let th em sit for a while in their own juices. Then mix together over the flame of continued competition. And there you have it: Cross-group hatred at a rolling boil. A more challenging issue then faced the experimenters: how to remove the now entrenched hostility. They first tried the cont act approach of bringing the bands together more often. Even when the joint activities were pleasant, such as movies and"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Liking 157 social events, the results were disastrous . Picnics produced food fights, entertainment programs gave way to shouting contests, di ning-hall lines degenerated into shoving matches. Sherif and his research team began to worry that, in Dr. Frankenstein fashion, they might have created a monster they could no longer control. The n, at the height of the strife, they tried a strategy that was at once simple and effective. They constructed a series of situations in which competition between the groups would have harmed everyone's interest; instead, c ooperation was necessary for mutual benefit. On a day-long outing, the single truck availabl e to go into town fo r food was \"found\" to be stuck. The boys were assembled and all pulled and pushed together until the vehicle was on its way. In another instance, the resear chers arranged for an interruption of the camp's water supply, which came through pipe s from a distant tank. Presented with the common crisis and realizing the need for uni fied action, the boys organized themselves harmoniously to find and fix the problem before day's end. In yet another circumstance requiring cooperation, the campers were inform ed that a desirable movie was available for rental but that the camp could not afford it. Aware that the only solution was to combine resources, the boys pooled their money for the film and spent a very congenial evening together enjoying it. The consequences of these cooperative ventures though not instantaneous, were nonetheless striking. Successful joint effort s toward common goals steadily bridged the rift between the two groups. Before long, the verbal baiting had died, the jostling in lines had ended, and the boys had begun to inte rmix at the meal tables. Further, when asked to list their best frie nds, significant numbers changed from an earlier exclusive naming of in-group chums to a listing that in cluded boys in the other group. Some even thanked the researchers for the opportunity to rate their friends again because they had changed their minds since the earlier evalua tion. In one reveali ng episode, the boys were returning from a campf ire on a single bus—something th at would have produced bedlam before but, at that point, was specif ically requested by the boys. When the bus stopped at a refreshment sta nd, the boys of one group, with $5 left in their treasury, decided to treat their former bitter adversar ies to milkshakes! We can trace the roots of this surprising turnabout to t hose times when the boys had to view one another as allies instead of opponents. The crucial procedur e was the experimenters' imposition of common goals on the groups. It wa s the cooperation required to achieve these goals that finally allowed the rival group members to experience one another as reasonable fellows, valued helpers, friends, and frie nds of friends (Wright, Aaron, McLaughlin- Volpe, & Ropp, 1997). When success resulted fr om the mutual efforts, it became especially difficult to maintain feelings of hostility toward those who had been teammates in the triumph. 4 You should not assume from these descriptio ns that successful cooperation works to reduce intergroup hostility only among school-a ge children. Subsequent research has found similar results of similar procedures in college groups (Worchel, 1979) and business organizations (Blake & Mout on, 1979). In these and most all groups, cooperation not only leads to greater liking but to greater group success (Stanne, D. W. Johnson, & R. T. Johnson, 1999). "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"158 Chapters Back to School In the welter of racial tensions that fo llowed school desegregation, certain educational psychologists began to see the relevance to th e classroom in Sherif et al.'s findings. If only the learning experience ther e could be modified to in clude at least occasional interethnic cooperation toward mutual succe sses, perhaps cross-gr oup friendships would have a place to grow. Although similar projects have been under wa y in various states (S. W. Cook, 1990, DeVries & Slavin, 1978; D. W. Johnson & R. T Johnson, 1983; Oskamp & Schultz, 1998), an especially intere sting approach in this direction—termed the jigsaw classroom—was developed by El liot Aronson and his colleagues in Texas and California (Aronson, Stepha n, Sikes, Blaney, & Snapp, 1978). The essence of the jigsaw route to learning is to require that students work together to master the material to be te sted on an upcoming examination. This end is accomplished by grouping students into cooperating teams and giving each student only part of the information—one piece of the puzzle—necessary to pass the test. Under this system the students must take turns teaching and help ing one another. Everyone needs everyone else to do well. Like Sherif's campers wo rking on tasks that could be successfully accomplished only jointly, the students become allies rather than enemies. When tried in newly desegregated classr ooms, the jigsaw approach has generated impressive results. Studies have shown that, compared to other classrooms in the same school using the traditional competitive met hod, jigsaw learning stimulated significantly more friendship and less prejudice among et hnic groups. Besides this vital reduction in hostility, there were other adva ntages: minority students' self -esteem, liking for school, and test scores improved. The white studen ts benefited, too. Their self-esteem and liking for school went up, and their test perf ormance was at least as high as that of whites in traditional classes (Aronson, Bridgeman, & Geffner, 1978a, 1978b). There is a tendency when faced with positive results like those from the jigsaw classroom to become overly enthusiastic a bout a single, simple solution to a difficult problem. Experience should tell us that such problems rarely yield to a simple remedy. That is no doubt true in this case as well. Even within the boundaries of cooperative learning procedures, the issues are comp lex (Rosenfield & Stephan, 1981; Slavin, 1983). Before we can feel truly comfortable wi th the jigsaw, or any similar approach to learning and liking, much more research is n eeded to determine how frequently, in what size doses, at which ages, and in which sorts of groups cooperative strategies will work. We also need to know the best way for teachers to institute new methods—provided they will institute them at all. After all, not only are cooperative learning techniques a radical departure from the traditional, familiar routine of most teachers, but they may also threaten a teacher's sense of importanc e in the classroom by turning over much of the instruction to the students. Finally, we must realize that competition has its place, too. It can serve as a valuable motivator of desirable action and an important builder of self-concept. The task, then, is not to eliminate aca- "},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Liking 159 demic competition but to br eak its monopoly in the classroom by introducing regular cooperative techniques that incl ude members of all ethnic gr oups and lead to successful outcomes. Despite these qualifications, I cannot help but be encouraged by the evidence to date. When I talk to my students, or even my neighbors and friends, about the prospects for cooperative learning approaches, I can feel the optimism rise in me. The bhc schools have for so long been sources of discouraging news—sinking test scores, teacher burnout, increasing crime, and of cour se, racial conflict. Now there is at least one crack in the gloom, and I find my self genuinely excited about it. What's the point of this digr ession into the effects of sc hool desegregation in race relations? The point is to make two points. First, although the familiarity pro-luced by contact usually leads to greater liki ng, the opposite occurs if the contact ties distasteful experiences with it. Therefore, when children of different racial groups are thrown into the incessant, harsh competition of the standard American classroom, we ought to—and do—see hostilities worsen. S econd, the evidence that team-oriented learning is an antidote to this disorder tell s us about the heavy im-Pact of cooperation on the liking process. "},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"160 Chapters Before we assume that cooperation is a powerful cause of liking, we should first pass it through what, to my mind, is th e acid test: Do compliance pr actitioners systematically use cooperation to get us to like them so that we will say yes to their requests? Do they point it out when it exists naturally in a situ ation? Do they try to amplify it when it exists only weakly? And, most instructive of all, do they manufacture it when it isn't there at all? As it turns out, cooperation passes the test w ith flying colors. Compliance professionals are forever attempting to establish that we and they are working for the same goals, that we must \"pull together\" for mutual benefit, that they are, in essence, our teammates. A host of examples is possible. Most are fam iliar, such as the new-car salespeople who take our side and \"do battle\" with their bosses to secure us a good deal. 5 One rather spectacular illustration occurs in a setting few of us would recognize firsthand, because the professionals are police in terrogators whose job is to induce suspects to confess to crime. In recent years, the courts have imposed a va riety of restrictions on the way police must behave in handling suspected criminals, especially in seeking confessions. Many procedures that, in the past, led to admi ssions of guilt can no longer be employed for fear that they will result in cases being dismissed. As yet, however, the courts have found nothing illegal in the poli ce's use of subtle psycholog y. For this reason, criminal interrogations have taken increa singly to the use of such pl oys as the one they call Good Cop/Bad Cop. Good Cop/Bad Cop works as follows: A young robbery suspect, for example, who has been advised of his rights a nd is maintaining his innocence, is brought to a room to be questioned by a pair of officers. One of the of ficers, either because the part suits him or because it is merely his turn, plays the role of Bad Cop. Before the suspect even sits down, Bad Cop curses \"the-son-of-a-bitch\" for the robbery. For the rest of the session his words come only with snarls and growls. He kicks the prisoner's chair to emphasize his points. When he looks at the suspect, he seems to see a mound of garbage. If the suspect challenges Bad Cop's accusations or just refuses to answer them, Bad Cop becomes livid. His rage soars. He swears he will do everything possible to assure a maximum sentence. He says he has friends in the district attorney's office who will hear from him of the suspect's noncooperative att itude and will prosecute the case hard. At the outset of Bad Cop's performance, hi s partner, Good Cop, sits in the background. Then, slowly, Good Cop starts to chip in. First he speaks only to Bad Cop, 5 In truth, little in th e way of combat takes place when the salesman enters the manager's office under such circumstances. Often, becau se the salesman knows exactly the price below which he cannot go, he and the boss d on't even speak. In one car dealership I infiltrated while researching this book, it wa s common for a salesman to have a soft drink or cigarette in silence while the boss continued working. After a seemly time, the salesman would loosen his tie and return to his customers, looking weary but carrying the deal he had just \"hammered out\" for th em—the same deal he had in mind before entering the boss' office."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Liking 161 trying to temper the burg eoning anger. \"Calm down, Frank, calm down.\" But Bad Cop shouts back, \"Don't tell me to calm down when he's lying right to my face! I hate these lying bastards!\" A bit later, Good Cop actually says something in the suspect's behalf. \"Take it easy, Frank, he's only a kid.\" Not much in the way of support, but compared to the rantings of Bad Cop, the words fall like music on the prisoner's ears. Still, Bad Cop is unconvinced. \"Kid? He's no kid. He's a pun k. That's what he is, a punk. And I'll tell you something else. He's over 18, and that's all I need to get his ass sent so far behind bars they'll need a flashlight to find him.\" Now Good Cop begins to speak directly to th e suspect, calling him by his first name and pointing out any positive details of the case. \"I'll tell you, Kenny, you're lucky that nobody was hurt and you weren't armed. When y ou come up for sentencing, that'll look good.\" If the suspect persists in claiming innocence, Bad Cop launches into another tirade of curses and threats. This time Good Cop stops him, \"Okay, Frank,\" handing Bad Cop some money, \"I think we could all use some coffee. How about getting us three cups?\" When Bad Cop is gone, it's time for Good Cop's big scene: \"Look, man, I don't know why, but my partner doesn't like you, and he's gonna try to get you. And he's gonna be able to do it, because we've got enough evid ence right now. And he's right about the D.A.'s office going hard on guys who don't coope rate. You're looking at five years, man, five years! Now, I don't want to se e that happen to you. So if you admit you robbed that place right now, before he gets b ack, I'll take charge of your case and put in a good word for you to the D. A. If we work t ogether on this, we can cut that five years down to two, maybe one. Do us both a favor , Kenny. Just tell me how you did it, and let's start working on getti ng you through this.\" A full confession frequently follows. Good Cop/Bad Cop works as well as it does for several reasons: The fear of long incarceration is quickly instilled by Bad Cop's threats; the perceptual contrast principle (see Chapter 1) ensures that compared to the raving, venomous Bad Cop, the interrogator playing Good Cop will seem like an especially reasonable and kind person (Kamisar, 1980); and because Good Cop has intervened repeatedly on the suspect's behalf—has even spent his own money for a cup of coffee—the reciprocity rule pressures for a return favor (Rafaeli & Sutton, 1991). The main reason that the technique is effective, though, is that it gives the suspect the idea that there is someone on his side, someone with his welfare in mi nd, someone working together with him, for him. In most situations, such a person woul d be viewed very favor ably, but in the deep trouble our robbery suspect finds himself, that person takes on the character of a savior. And from savior, it is but a short step to trusted father confessor. CONDITIONING AND ASSOCIATION_________________ 'Why do they blame me, Doc?\" It was the shaky telephone voice of a local TV weath- e rman. He had been given my number when he called the psychology department at "},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"162 Chapter 5 my university to find someone who could answer his question—a question that had always puzzled him but had recently begun to bother and depress him. \"I mean, it's crazy, isn't it? Ev erybody knows that I just report the weather, that I don't order it, right? So how come I get so much flak when the weather's bad? During the floods last year, I got hate mail! One guy thr eatened to shoot me if it didn't stop raining. Christ, I'm still looking over my shoulder from that one. And the people I work with at the station do it, too! Sometimes, right on the air, they'll zing me about a heat wave or something. They have to know that I'm not responsible, but that doesn't seem to stop them. Can you help me understand this, Doc? It's really getting me down.\" We made an appointment to talk in my offi ce, where I tried to explain that he was the victim of an ages-old click, whirr response that people have to things they perceive as merely connected to one anothe r. Instances of this response abound in modern life. I felt that the example most likely to help the di stressed weatherman w ould require a bit of ancient history. I asked him to consider the precarious fate of the imperial messengers of old Persia. Any such messenger assigned the role of military courier had special cause to hope mightily for Persian battlefiel d successes. With news of victory in his pouch, he would be treated as a hero upon his arrival at the palace. The food, drink, and women of his choice were provided gladly a nd sumptuously. Should his message tell of military disaster, though, the reception woul d be quite different: He was summarily slain. I hoped that the point of this story would not be lost on the weatherman. I wanted him to be aware of a fact that is as true today as it was in the time of ancient Persia: The nature of bad news infects th e teller. There is a natural huma n tendency to dislike a person who brings us unpleasant information, even when that person did not cause the bad news. The simple association with it is enough to stimulate our dislike (Manis, Cornell, & Moore, 1974). There was something else I hoped the weat herman would get from the historical example. Not only was he joined in his pred icament by centuries of other \"tellers,\" but also, compared to some (such as the Persia n messengers), he was very well-off. At the end of our session, he said something to convin ce me that he apprec iated this point quite clearly. \"Doc,\" he said on his way out, \"I feel a lot better about my job now. I mean, I'm in Phoenix where the sun shines 300 da ys a year, right? Thank God I don't do the weather in Buffalo.\" The weatherman's parting comment reveals that he understood more than I had told him about the principle that was influencing hi s viewers' liking for him. Being connected with bad weather does have a negative effect , but being connected with sunshine should do wonders for his popularity. And he was ri ght. The principle of association is a general one, governing both nega tive and positive connections. An innocent association with either bad things or good things will influen ce how people feel about us (Lott & Lott, 1965). Our instruction about the way negative associ ation works seems to have been primarily undertaken by our parents. Remember how they are always warning us against"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Liking 163 "},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"164 Chapters playing with the bad kids down the street? Re member how they said it didn't matter if we did nothing bad ourselves because, in the eyes of the neighborhood, we would be \"known by the company we kept.\" Our pare nts were teaching us about guilt by association—and they were giving us a lesso n in the negative side of the principle of association. And they were right. People do assume that we have the same personality traits as our friends (Miller, Campbell, Twedt, & O'Connell, 1966). As for the positive associations, it is the co mpliance professionals who teach the lesson. They are incessantly trying to connect themselves or their products with the things we like. Did you ever wonder what all thos e good-looking models are doing standing around in the automobile ads? What the adve rtiser hopes they are doing is lending their positive traits—beauty and desirability—to the car s. The advertiser is betting that we will respond to the product in the same ways we respond to the attractive models merely associated with it—and we do. In one study, men who saw a new-car ad that included a seductive female model rated the car as faster, more appealing, more expens ive-looking, and bette r-designed than did men who viewed the same ad without the model. Yet when asked later, the men refused to believe that the presence of the young wo man had influenced their judgments (Smith & Engel, 1968). Although there are other examples (Bie rley, McSweeney, & Vannieuwkerk, 1985; Gorn, 1982), perhaps the most intriguing evid ence of the way the association principle can unconsciously stimulate us to part w ith our money comes from a series of investigations on credit cards and spending (Feinberg, 1986). Within modern life, credit cards are a relatively new de vice with a psychologically no teworthy characteristic: They allow us to get the immediate benefits of goods and services while deferring the costs weeks into the future. Consequently, we are mo re likely to associate credit cards and the insignias, symbols, and logos that represen t them with the posit ive rather than the negative aspects of spending. Consumer researcher Richard Feinberg wonde red what effects the presence of such credit cards and credit card materials had on our tendencies to spend. In a set of studies done in West Lafayette, Indiana, he got some fascinating—and disturbing— results. First, restaurant patrons gave larger tips when paying with a credit card instead of cash. In a second study, college student s were willing to spend an average of 29 percent more money for mail-order catalog items when they examined the items in a room that contained some MasterCard insignias; moreover, they had no awareness that the credit card insignias were part of the experiment. A final study sh owed that when asked to contribute to charity (the Un ited Way), college students were markedly more likely to give money if the room they were in contai ned MasterCard insignias than if it did not (87 percent versus 33 percent). This last fi nding is simultaneously the most unsettling and instructive concerning the power of the association principle to generate compliance. Even though credit cards them selves were not used for the charity donation, the mere presence of their symbol (with its atte ndant positive associations) spurred people to spend more cash. This last phenomenon has b een replicated in a pair of restaurant studies in which patrons received their bills on tip tray s that either did or"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Liking 165 did not contain a credit card insignia. Th e diners tipped significantly more in the presence of the insignia, even when they paid with cash (McCall and Belmont, 1996). 6 Because the association principle works so well—and so unconsciously— manufacturers regularly rush to connect th eir products with the current cultural rage. During the days of the first American moon shot, everything from breakfast drink to deodorant was sold with allusi ons to the American space pr ogram. In Olympiad years, we are told precisely the official hair sp rays and facial tissue of our Olympic teams. 7 During the 1970s, when the magic cultural con cept appeared to be \"naturalness,\" the \"natural\" bandwagon was crowded to cap acity. Sometimes the connections to naturalness didn't even make sense: \"Cha nge your hair color naturally\" urged one popular TV commercial. Similarly, although it made great sense th at sales of Mars Rover toys would jump after a U.S. Pathfi nder rocket landed the real thing on the red planet in 1997, it made little sense that the same would happen for the sales of Mars Candy Bars, which have nothing to do with the space project but are named after the candy company's founder, Franklin Mars (White, 1997). The linking of celebrities to products is another way advertisers cash in on the association principle. Professiona l athletes are paid to connect themselves to things that can be directly relevant to th eir roles (sports shoes, tennis racquets, golf balls) or wholly irrelevant (soft drinks, popcorn poppers, panty hose). The important thing for the advertiser is to establish the connection; it doesn't have to be a logical one, just a positive one. Of course, popular entertainers provide anothe r form of desirability that manufacturers have always paid dearly to tie to their goods. Recently, politicians have recognized the ability of a celebrity linkage to sway voters. According to Democratic Party consultant Tom Yamuda, who prepared a report titled \"Celebrities = Sell-Ebrities,\" movie star endorsement is \"the very best way to ge t your wish to become law\" (Glass, 1997). Presidential candidates assemble stables of well-known nonpo-litical figure s who either actively participate in, or merely lend thei r names to, a campaign. Even at state and local levels, a similar game is played. Take as evidence Subsequent research by Feinbe rg (1990) strengthens the association explanation for his results. He has found that the presence of cred it card insignias in a room only facilitates spending by people who have had a positive hi story with credit cards. Those who have had a negative history with credit cards —because they've paid an above-average number of interest charges in the previous year—do not show the facilitation effect. In fact, these individuals are more conservative in their spending tendencies when in the mere presence of credit card logos. The rights to such associations do not co me cheaply. Corporate contributors spend millions to win sponsorships for the Olympics . But this amount pales in comparison to the many millions more these companies then spend to advertise their connection to the event. Yet it may he that the largest dollar fi gure of all for the corporate sponsors is the one on the profit line.

Does the Name Pavlov Ring a Bell? While politicians have long strained to as sociate themselves with the values of motherhood, country, and apple pie, it may be in the last of these connections—to food— that they have been most clever. For instance, it is White House tradition to try to sway the votes of balking legislators over a meal. It can be a picnic lunch, a sumptuous breakfast, or an elegant dinner; but when an important bi ll is up for grabs, out comes the silverware. Political fund-ra ising these days regularly involves the presentation of food. Notice, too, that at the typical fund -raising dinner the speeches and the appeals for further contribu tions and heightened effort never come before the meal is served, only during or after. There are several advantages to this technique. For example, time is saved and the reciprocity ru le is engaged. The least recognized benefit, however, may be the one uncovered in re search conducted in the 1930s by the distinguished psychologist Gregory Razran (1938). Using what he termed the \"luncheon techni que,\" he found that his subjects become fonder of the people and things they experienced while they were eating. In the example most relevant for our purposes (Razran, 1940 ), subjects were pr esented with some political statements they had rated once before. At the end of the experiment, after all the political statements had been presented, Razran found that only certain of them had gained in approval—those th at had been shown while food was being eaten. These changes in liking seem to have occurred unc onsciously, since the subjects could not remember which of the statements they had seen while the food was being served. 8 How did Razran come up with the luncheon technique? What made him think it would work? The answer may lie in the dual scholar ly roles he played during his career. Not only was he a respected independent resear cher, he was also one of the earliest translators into English of the pioneering ps ychological literature of Russia. It was a literature dedicated to the study of the a ssociation principle and dominated by the thinking of a brilliant man, Ivan Pavlov. Although a scientist of broad a nd varied talent—he had, for instance, won a Nobel Prize years earlier for his work on the dige stive system—Pavlov' s most important experimental demonstration was simplicity it self. He showed that he could get an animal's typical response to food (saliva tion) to be directed toward something To demonstrate that the principle of associ ation also works for unpleasant experiences, Razran (1940) included in his experiment a condition in which certain participants had putrid odors Piped into the room while they were shown the political slogans. In this case, approval ratings for the slogans declined. "},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"168 Chapters irrelevant to food (a bell) merely by c onnecting the two things in the animal's experience. If the presenta tion of food to a dog was always accompanied by the sound of a bell, soon the dog would sa livate to the bell alone, even when there was no food to be had. It is not a long step from Pavlov's classic de monstration to Razran's luncheon technique. Obviously, a normal reaction to food can be tr ansferred to some other thing through the process of raw association. Razran's insight was that there are many normal responses to food besides salivation, one of them being a goo d and favorable feeling. Therefore, it is possible to attach this pleasant feeling, this positive attitude, to anything (political statements being only an example) that is closely associated with good food. Nor is there a long step from the lunche on technique to the compliance professionals' realization that all ki nds of desirable things can subs titute for food in lending their likable qualities to the ideas, products, and people artificia lly linked to them. In the final analysis, then, that is why those good-looking models stand around in the magazine ads. That is why radio programmers are instructed to insert the station's call-letters jingle immediately before a big hit song is playe d. And that is even why the women playing Barnyard Bingo at a Tupperwar e party must yell the word Tupper-ware rather than Bingo before they can rush to the center of th e floor for a prize. It may be Tupperware for the players, but it's Bingo! for the company. Just because we are often unaware victim s of compliance practitioners' use of the association principle doesn't mean that we don't understand how it works or don't use it ourselves. There is ample evidence, for instance, that we understand fully the predicament of a Persian imperial messe nger or modern-day weatherman announcing the bad news. In fact, we can be counted on to take steps to avoi d putting ourselves in any similar positions. Research done at the Un iversity of Georgia shows just how we operate when faced with the task of comm unicating good or bad news (Rosen & Tesser, 1970). Students waiting for an experiment to begin were given the job of informing a fellow student that an important phone call ha d come in for him. Half the time the call was supposed to bring good news and half the time, bad news. The researchers found that the students conveyed the information very differently depending on its quality. When the news was positive, the tellers were sure to mention that feature: \"You just got a phone call with great news. Better see the experimenter for the details.\" When the news was unfavorable, they kept themselves apart from it: \"You just got a phone call. Better see the experimenter for the details.\" Obviously, the studen ts had previously learned that, to be liked, they should c onnect themselves to good news but not bad news. From the News and Weather to the Sports A lot of strange behavior can be explaine d by the fact that people understand the association principle well enough to try to link themselves to positive events and separate themselves from negative events—e ven when they have not caused the events. "},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Liking 169 Some of the strangest of such behavior ta kes place in the great arena of sports. The actions of the athletes are not the issue, t hough. After all, in the heated contact of the game, they are entitled to an occasional eccen tric outburst. Instead, it is the often raging, irrational, boundless fervor of sports fans that seems, on its face, so puzzling. How can we account for wild sports riots in Europe, or the murder of players and referees by South American soccer crowds gone berserk, or the unnecessary lavish-ness of gifts provided by local fans to already wealthy Am erican ballplayers on the special \"day\" set aside to honor them? Rationall y, none of this makes sense. It's just a game! Isn't it? Hardly. The relationship between sport and earnest fan is an ything but game-like. It is serious, intense, and highly personal. An ap t illustration comes from one of my favorite anecdotes. It concerns a World War II soldie r who returned to his home in the Balkans after the war and shortly th ereafter stopped speaking. Medical examinations could find no physical cause for the problem. Ther e was no wound, no brain damage, no vocal impairment. He could read, write, understand a conversation, and follow orders. Yet he would not talk—not for his docto rs, not for his friends, not ev en for his pleading family. Perplexed and exasperated, his doctors moved him to another city and placed him in a veterans' hospital where he remained for 30 years, never breaking his self-imposed silence and sinking into a lif e of social isolation. Then one day, a radio in his ward happened to be tuned to a soccer match between his hometown team and a traditional rival. When at a crucial point of play the re feree called a foul against a player from the mute veteran's home team, he jumped from hi s chair, glared at the radio, and spoke his first words in more than three decades: \"Y ou dumb ass!\" he cried. \"Are you trying to give them the match?\" With that, he returned to his chair and to a silence he never again violated. There are two important lessons to be derive d from this true story. The first concerns the sheer power of the phenomenon. The vetera n's desire to have his hometown team succeed was so strong that it alone produced a deviation from his solidly entrenched way of life. The second lesson reveals much about the nature of the union of sports and sports fans, something crucial to its basic character: It is a personal thing. Whatever fragment of an identity that ravaged, mu te man still possessed was engaged by soccer play. No matter how weakened his ego may have become after 30 years of wordless stagnation in a hospital ward, it was invol ved in the outcome of the match. Why? Because he, personally, would be diminished by a hometown defeat, and he, personally, would be enhanced by a hometown victory. How? Through the princi ple of association. The mere connection of birthplace hooked him, wrapped him, tied him to the approaching triumph or failure. This phenomenon helps explain the tragic event that befell te nnis superstar Monica Seles in April of 1993. In the midst of a match at the Citizen Cup Tournament in Hamburg, Germany, a spectator lunged out of the stands and buried a boning knife m her back. In one sense, Seles and the tourna ment security crew had been worried about just such an occurrence. It happened at th e time of the brutal civil war in Bosnia "},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"170 Chapters between the Serbs and the Croats when accusa tions of Serbian atrocities were making worldwide headlines. Seles, Serbian by birt h, had been the subject of various death threats and political attacks for months be fore the incident, causing her to travel frequently under another name, to make multiple plane reservations, and even to wear a disguise. When her assailant struck, everyone assumed that his act was connected to the bloody strife in Seles' homeland. But, no; her attacker, an unemployed lathe operator from eastern Germany, was not a political or ethnic terrorist. He was a sports fan. His intent was not to kill Seles but only to injure her so that her rival__and his countrywoman—Steffi Graf could regain the N o. 1 ranking that she had previously lost to Seles. What centuries-old ethnic hatreds a nd a raging war had not been able to do to Monica Seles, the power of sports accomplished. As distinguished author Isaac Asimov (1975) put it in describing our reactions to the contests we view, \"All things being equal, you root for your own sex, your own culture, your own locality ... and what you want to prove is that you are better than the other person. Whomever you root for represents you; and when he [or she] wins, you win.\" When viewed in this light, the passion of a s ports fan begins to make sense. The game is no light diversion to be enjoyed for its inhere nt form and artistry. The self is at stake. That is why hometown crowds are so adori ng and, more tellingly, so grateful toward those regularly responsible for home-team vict ories. That is also why the same crowds are often ferocious in their treatment of players, coaches, and officials implicated in athletic failures. 9 So we want our affiliated sports teams to win to prove our own superiority, but to whom are we trying to prove it? Ourselves, certain ly, but to everyone el se, too. According to the association principle, if we can su rround ourselves with success that we are connected with in even a superficial way (f or example, place of residence), our public prestige will rise. All this tells me is that we purposefully manipulate the visibility of our connections with winners and losers in order to ma ke ourselves look good to anyone who views these connections. By showcasing the positiv e associations and burying the negative ones, we are trying to get observers to thi nk more highly of us and to like us more. There are many ways we go about this, but one of the simplest and most pervasive is in the pronouns we use. Have you noticed for example, how often after a home-team victory fans crowd into the range of a TV camera, thrust their index fingers high, and shout, \"We're number one! We're number one!\" Note that the ca ll is not \"They're number one\" or even \"Our team is number one.\" The pronoun is we, designed to imply the closest possible iden tity with the team. 9 Take, for example, the case of Andres Es cobar who, as a member of the Colombian national team, accidentally tipped a ball in to his own team's net during a World Cup soccer match in 1994. The \"auto-goal\" led to a U.S. team victory and to the elimination of the favored Colombians from the competition. Back home two weeks later, Escobar was executed in a restaurant by two gunmen, who shot him 12 times for his mistake."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Liking 171 "},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"172 Chapters Note also that nothing similar occurs in th e case of failure. No television viewer will ever hear the chant, \"We're in last place! We're in last place!\" Home-team defeats are the times for distancing oneself. Here we is not nearly as preferred as the insulating pronoun they. To prove the point, I once did a small experiment in which students at Arizona State University were phoned and aske d to describe the outcome of a football game their school team had played a few w eeks earlier (Cialdini et al., 1976). Some of the students were asked the out come of a certain game their team had lost; the other students were asked the outcome of a di fferent game—one their team had won. My fellow researcher, Avril Thorne, and I simply listened to what was said and recorded the percentage of students who used the word we in their descriptions. When the results were tabulated, it was obvious that the stude nts had tried to connect themselves to success by using the pronoun we to describe their school- team victory—\"We beat Houston, 17 to 14,\" or \"We won.\" In the case of the lost game, however, we was rarely used. Instead, the students used terms designed to keep themselves separate from their defeated team—\"They lost to Missouri, 30 to 20,\" or \"I don't know the score, but Arizona State got beat.\" Perhap s the twin desires to connect ourselves to winners and to distance ourselves from losers were combin ed consummately in the remarks of one particular student. After dryly recounting th e score of the home-team defeat—\"Arizona State lost it, 30 to 20\"—he blurted in anguish, \"They threw away our chance for a national championship!\" "},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Liking 173 Although the desire to bask in reflected glory exists to a degree in all of us, there seems to be something special about people who woul d take this normal tendency too far. Just what kind of people are they? Unless I miss my guess, they are not merely great sports aficionados; they are indivi duals with hidden personality flaws: poor self-concepts. Deep inside is a sense of low personal worth that directs them to seek prestige not from the generation or promotion of their own attainments but from the generation or promotion of their associations with others' attainments. Th ere are several varieties of this species that bloom throughout our culture. The persistent name-dropper is a classic example. So, too, is the rock-music groupie, w ho trades sexual favors for the right to tell friends that she or he was \"with\" a famous mu sician for a time. No matter which form it takes, the behavior of such individuals shares a similar theme—the rather tragic view of accomplishment as deriving from outside the self. Certain of these people work the associati on principle in a slightly different way. Instead of striving to inflate their visible connect ions to others of success, they strive to inflate the success of others they are visibl y connected to. The clearest illustration is the notorious \"stage mother,\" obsessed with securing stardom for he r child. Of course, women are not alone in this regard. In 1991, a Davenport, Iowa, obstetrician cut off service to the wives of three school official s, reportedly because his son had not been given enough playing time in school basketba ll games. One of the wives was eight months pregnant at the time. READER'S REPORT 5.2 From a Los Angeles Movie Studio Employee Because I work in the industry, I'm a huge film buff. The biggest night of the year for me is the night of the Academy Awards. I even tape the shows so I can replay the acceptance speeches of the arti sts I really admire. One of my favorite speeches was what Kevin Costner said after his film Dances with Wolves won best picture in 1991.1 liked it because he was responding to critics who say that the movies aren't important. In fact, I liked it so much th at I copied it down. But there is one thing about the speech that I never understood before. Here's what he said about winning the best picture award: \"While it may not be as important as the rest of the world situation, it will always be important to us. My family will never forget what happe ned here; my Native American brothers and sisters, especi ally the Lakota Sioux, will ne ver forget, and the people I went to high school with will never forget.\" OK, I get why Kevin Costner would never fo rget this enormous honor. And I also get why his family would never forget it. And I even get why Native Americans would remember it, since the film is about them. But I never understood why he mentioned the people he went to high school with. Then, I read about how sports fans think they can \"bask in the reflected glory\" of their hometown stars and te ams. And, I realized that it's the same thing. Everyone who went to sc hool with Kevin Costne r would be telling everyone about their connection the day after he won the Oscar, thinking that"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"174 Chapters they would get some prestige out of it even though they had zero to do with the film. They would be right, too, because that's how it works. You don't have to be a star to get the glory. Sometimes you only have to be associated with the star somehow. How interesting. Author's note: I've seen this sort of thing work in my own life when I've told architect friends that I was bom in the same place as the great Frank Lloyd Wright. Please understand, I can't even draw a straight line; but I can see the favorable reaction in my friends' eyes. \"Wow,\" they seem to say, \"You and Frank Lloyd Wright?\" DEFENSE Because liking can be increased by many m eans, a list of the defenses against compliance professionals who employ the lik ing rule must, oddly enough, be a short one. It would be pointless to construct a horde of specific countertactics to combat each of the countless versions of the various ways to influence liking. There are simply too many routes to be blocked effectively with such a one-on-one strategy. Besides, several of the factors leading to lik ing—physical attractiveness, familiarity, association— have been shown to work unconsciously to pr oduce their effects on us , making it unlikely that we could muster a timely protection against them anyway. Instead we need to consider a general appro ach, one that can be applied to any of the liking-related factors to neutralize th eir unwelcome influence on our compliance decisions. The secret to such an approach ma y lie in its timing. Rather than trying to recognize and prevent the action of liking factor s before they have a chance to work on us, we might be well advised to let them work. Our vigila nce should be directed not toward the things that may produce undue liking for a compliance practitioner but toward the fact that undue liking has been produced. The time to call out the defense is when we feel ourselves liking the prac titioner more than we should under the circumstances. By concentrating our attention on the effects rather than the causes, we can avoid the laborious, nearly impossible task of trying to detect and deflect the many psychological influences on liking. Instead, we have to be sensitive to only one thing related to liking in our contacts with compliance practitioners: the feeling that we have come to like the practitioner more quickly or more deeply than we would have expected. Once we notice this feeling, we will have been tipped off that there is probably some tactic being used, and we can start taking the necessary countermeasures. Note that the strategy I am suggesting borrows much from the jujitsu style favored by the compliance professionals themselves. We don't attempt to restrain the influence of the fact ors that cause liking. Quite the contrary. We allow those factors to exert their force, and then we use that force in our campaign against those who woul d profit by them. The stronger the force, the more conspicuous it becomes and, conse quently, the more subject to our alerted defenses. "},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Liking 175 Suppose, for example, we find ourselves ba rgaining on the price of a new car with Dealin' Dan, a candidate for Joe Girard's v acated \"Greatest Car Salesman\" title. After talking a while and negotiating a bit, Dan wants to close the deal: he wants us to decide to buy the car. Before any such decision is made, we should ask ourselves the crucial question, \"In the 25 minutes I've known this guy, have I come to like him more than I would have expected?\" If the answer is yes, we might want to reflect on the ways Dan behaved during those few minut es. We might recall that he has fed us (coffee and doughnuts), complimented us on our choice of options and color combinations, made us laugh, and cooperated with us against the sales manager to ge t us a better deal. Although such a review of events might be in formative, it is not a necessary step in protecting ourselves from the liking rule. Once we discover that we have come to like Dan more than we would have expecte d, we don't have to know why. The simple recognition of unwarranted liking should be enough to get us to react against it. One possible reaction would be to reverse the process and ac tively dislike Dan, but that might be unfair to him and contrary to our ow n interests. After all, some individuals are naturally likeable, and Dan might just be one of them. It wouldn't be right to turn automatically against those compliance prof essionals who happen to be most likeable. Besides, for our own sakes, we wouldn't wa nt to shut ourselves off from business interactions with such nice pe ople, especially when they may be offering us the best available deal. I recommend a different reaction. If our answ er to the crucial question is \"Yes, under the circumstances, I like this guy peculiarly well,\" this should be the si gnal that the time has come for a quick countermaneuver: Ment ally separate Dan from that Chevy or Toyota he's trying to sell. It is vital to remember at this point that, should we choose Dan's car, we will be driving it, not him, off the dealership lot. It is irrelevant to a wise automobile purchase that we find Dan likeab le because he is good-looking, claims an interest in our favorite hobby, is funny, or has relatives living where we grew up. Our proper response, then, is a conscious effo rt to concentrate excl usively on the merits of the deal and the car Dan has for us. Of course, when we make a compliance decision, it is always a good idea to separate our fee lings about the requester from the request. Once immersed in even a brief personal and sociable contact with a requester, however, we may easily forget that dis tinction. In those instances when we don't care one way or the other about a requester, forgetting to make the distinction won't steer us very far wrong. The big mistakes are likely to come when we like the person making the request. That's why it is so important to be alert to a sense of undue liking for a compliance practitioner. The recognition of that feeling can serve as our reminder to separate the dealer from the merits of the deal and to make our decision based on considerations related only to the latter. Were we all to follo w this procedure, I am certain we would be much more pleased with the results of our exchanges with comp liance professionals— though I suspect that Dealin' Dan would not. "},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"176 Chapters SUMMARY People prefer to say yes to individuals they know and like. Recognizing this rule, compliance professionals commonly increase th eir effectiveness by emphasizing several factors that increase their overall attractiv eness and likability. One feature of a person that influences overall liking is physic al attractiveness. Although it has long been suspected that physical beauty provides an advantage in social interaction, research indicates that the a dvantage may be greater than s upposed. Physical attractiveness seems to engender a halo effect that extends to favorable impressions of other traits such as talent, kindness, and intelligence. As a re sult, attractive people are more persuasive both in terms of getting what they reque st and in changing others' attitudes. A second factor that influences liking and compliance is similarity. We like people who are like us, and we are more willing to say ye s to their requests, often in an unthinking manner. Another factor that produces liki ng is praise. Although they can sometimes backfire when crudely transparent, comp liments generally enhance liking and, thus, compliance. Increased familiarity through repeated contac t with a person or thing is yet another factor that normally facilitates liking. This relationship holds true principally when the contact takes place under positive rather than negative circumstances. One positive circumstance that works especially well is mutual and successful cooperation. A fifth factor linked to liking is a ssociation. By connecting themse lves or their products with positive things, advertisers, politicians, and me rchandisers frequently seek to share in the positivity through the proce ss of association. Other indi viduals as well (sports fans, for example) appear to recognize the effect of simple connections and try to associate themselves with favorable events and distan ce themselves from unfavorable events in the eyes of observers. A potentially effective strategy for reduci ng the unwanted influence of liking on compliance decisions requires a special sensit ivity to the experience of undue liking for a requester. Upon recognizing that we like a requester inordina tely well under the circumstances, we should step back from th e social interaction, mentally separate the requester from his or her offer, and make any compliance decision based solely on the merits of the offer.

Suppose further that, finding the idea of such an experiment intriguing, you contact the director of the study, Professor Stanley Mil-gram, and make arrangements to participate in an hour-long session. When you arrive at the laboratory suite, you meet two men. One is the researcher in charge of the experiment, clearly evidenced by the grey lab coat he wears and the clipboard he carries. The othe r is a volunteer like yourself who seems quite av erage in all respects. After initial greetings and pleasantries are ex changed, the researcher begins to explain the procedures to be followed. He says that the experiment is a study of how punishment affects learning and memory. Theref ore, one participant will have the task of learning pairs of words in a long list until each pair can be recalled perfectly; this person is to be called the Learner. The other pa rticipant's job will be to test the Learner's memory and to deliver increasingly strong electr ic shocks for every mistake; this person will be designated the Teacher. Naturally, you get a bit nervous at this news . Your apprehension increases when, after drawing lots with your partne r, you find that you are assi gned the Learner role. You hadn't expected the possibility of pain as part of the study, so you briefly consider leaving. But no, you think, there's plenty of ti me for that if need be and, besides how strong a shock could it be? After you have had a chance to study the list of word pairs, the researcher straps you into a chair and, with the Teacher looking on, attaches electrodes to your arm. More worried now about the effect of the shock, you inquire into its sever ity. The researcher's response is hardly comforti ng. He says that although th e shocks can be extremely painful, they will cause you \"no permanent tissue damage.\" With that, the researcher and Teacher leave you alone and go to the next room where the Teacher asks you the test questions through an in tercom system and delivers el ectric punishment for every wrong response. As the test proceeds, you quickly recognize the pattern that the Teacher follows: He asks the question and waits for your answer over the intercom. Whenever you err, he announces the voltage of the shock you are about to receive and pulls a lever to deliver the punishment. The most troubling thing is that, with each error you make, the shock increases by 15 volts. The first part of the test progresses smoot hly. The shocks are annoying but tolerable. Later on, though, as you make more mistak es and the shock voltages climb, the punishment begins to hurt enough to disrupt your concentration, wh ich leads to more errors and ever more disruptive shocks. At the 75-, 90-, and 105-volt levels, the Pain makes you grunt audibly. At 120 volts, you excl aim into the intercom that the shocks are really starting to hurt. You take one more puni shment with a groan and decide that you can't take much more pain. After the Teacher delivers the 150-volt "},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"180 Chapter 6 shock, you shout back into the intercom \"That' s all. Get me out of here. Get me out of here, please. Let me out.\" Instead of the assurance you expect from th e Teacher, that he and the researcher are coming to release you, he merely gives you th e next test question to answer. Surprised and confused you mumble the first answer to come into your head. It's wrong, of course, and the Teacher delivers a 165-volt shock. You scream at the Teacher to stop, to let you out. He responds only with the next test question—and with the next slashing shock, when your frenzied answer is incorrect. Y ou can't hold down the panic any longer, the shocks are so strong now they make you writh e and shriek. You kick the wall, demand to be released, and beg the Teacher to help you. However, the test questions continue as before and so do the dreaded shocks—in searing jolts of 195, 210, 225, 240, 255, 270, 285, and 300 volts. You realize that you can't possibly answer the questions correctly now, so you shout to the Teacher that you won' t answer his questions anymore. Nothing changes; the Teacher interprets your failure to respond as an incorrect response and sends another bolt. The ordeal continues in this way until, finally, the power of the shocks stuns you into near-paralysis. You can no longer cry out, no longer struggle. You can only feel each terrible el ectric bite. Perhaps, you think, this total inactivity will cause the Teacher to stop. There can be no reason to continue this experiment, but he proceeds relentlessly, calling out the test questions, announcing the horrid shock levels (above 400 volts now), and pulling the levers. What must this man be like, you wonder in confusion. Why doesn't he help me? Why won't he stop? THE POWER OF AUTHORITY PRESSURE For most of us, the previous scenario reads like a bad dream. To recognize how nightmarish it is, though, we s hould understand that, in most respects, it is real. There was such an experiment—actually, a w hole series—run by a psychology professor named Milgram (1974) in which participants in the Teacher role were willing to deliver continued, intense, and dangerous levels of shock to a kicki ng, screeching, pleading Learner. Only one major aspect of the expe riment was not genuine. No real shock was delivered; the Learner, who re peatedly cried out in agony for mercy and release, was not a true subject but an actor who only pretended to be s hocked. The actual purpose of Milgram's study, then, had nothing to do with the effects of punish ment on learning and memory. Rather, it involved an entirely di fferent question: When it is their job, how much suffering will ordinary people be willi ng to inflict on an en tirely innocent other person? The answer is most unsettling. Under circumst ances mirroring precisely the features of the \"bad dream,\" the typical Teacher was wi lling to deliver as much pain as was available to give. Rather than yield to the pleas of the victim, about two-thirds of the subjects in Milgram's experiment pulled ever y one of the 30 shock switches in front of them and continued to engage the la st switch (450 volts) until the re- "},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Authority 1 81 searcher ended the experiment. More alarming still, almost none of the 40 subjects in this study quit his job as Teacher when the vi ctim first began to demand his release, nor later when he began to beg for it, nor even later when his reaction to each shock had become, in Milgram's words, \"definitely an agonized scream.\" These results surprised everyone associated with the project, Milgram included. In fact, before the study began, he asked groups of colleagues, graduate students, and psychology majors at Yale University (where the experiment was performed) to read a copy of the experimental procedures and estimate how many subjects would go all the way to the last (450-volt) shock. Invariably, the answers fell in th e 1-2 percent range. A separate group of 39 psychiatrists predic ted that only about one person in a thousand would be willing to continue to the end. No one, then, was prepared for the behavior pattern that the experiment actually produced. How can we explain that alarming pattern? Pe rhaps, as some have argued, it has to do with the fact that the subjects were all males who are known as a group for "},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"182 Chapter 6 their aggressive tendencies, or that the s ubjects didn't recognize th e potential harm that such high shock voltages could cause, or that the subjects were a freakish collection of moral cretins who enjoyed the chance to in flict misery. There is good evidence against each of these possibilities. First, a later ex periment showed that the subjects' sex was irrelevant to their willingness to give all the shocks to the victim; female Teachers were just as likely to do so as were the males in Milgram's initial study. Another experiment investigat ed the explanation that su bjects weren't aware of the potential physical danger to the victim. In th is experiment the victim was instructed to announce that he had a heart condition and to declare that his hear t was being affected by the shock: \"That's all. Get me out of he re. I told you I had heart trouble. My heart's starting to bother me. I refuse to go on. Le t me out.\" Once again the results were the same; 65 percent of the subjects carried out their duties faithfully through to the maximum shock. Finally, the explanation that Milgram's subjects were a twis ted, sadistic bunch not at all representative of average citizens has proven unsatisfactory as well. The people who answered Milgram's newspaper ad to pa rticipate in his \"memory\" experiment represented a standard cross section of ages , occupations, and educational levels within our society. What's more, later on, a battery of personality scales showed these people to be quite normal psychologically, with not a hi nt of psychosis as a group. They were, in fact, just like you and me; or, as Milgram likes to term it, they are you and me. If he is right that his studies implicate us in thei r grisly findings, the unanswered question becomes an uncomfortably personal one, \"What could make us do such things?\" Milgram is sure he knows the answer. It has to do, he says, with a deep-seated sense of duty to authority. According to Milgram, th e real culprit in the experiments was his subjects' inability to defy the wishes of th e boss, the lab-coated researcher who urged and, if necessary, directed the subjects to pe rform their duties, desp ite the emotional and physical mayhem they were causing. The evidence supporting Milgram's obedience-t o-authority explanation is strong. First, it is clear that, without the researcher's dir ectives to continue, the subjects would have ended the experiment quickly. They hated wh at they were doing a nd agonized over their victim's anguish. They implored the researcher to let them stop. When he refused, they went on, but in the process th ey trembled, they perspire d, they shook, they stammered protests and additional pleas for the victim's release. Th eir fingernails dug into their own flesh; they bit their lips until they bled; they held their heads in their hands; some fell into fits of uncontrollable nervous laughter. An outside observer to Milgram's initial experiment described one subject. / observed a mature and initia lly poised businessman enter the laboratory smiling and confident. Within 20 minutes he was reduced to a twitching, "},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Authority 183 stuttering wreck, who was rapidly approachi ng a point of nervous collapse. He constantly pulled on his earlobe and twisted his hands. At one point he pushed his fist into his forehead and muttered: \"Oh, God, le t's stop it.\" And ye t he continued to respond to every word of the experimenter and obeyed to the end. (Milgram, 1963, p. 377) In addition to these observations, Milgram has provided even more convincing evidence for the obedience-to-authorit y interpretation of his subj ects' behavior. In a later experiment, for instance, he had the research er and the victim switch scripts so that the researcher told the Teacher to stop delive ring shocks to the vic tim, while the victim insisted bravely that the Teacher continue. The result couldn't have been clearer; 100 percent of the subjects refused to give one additional shock when it was merely the fellow subject who demanded it. The identical finding appeared in another version of the experiment in which the researcher and fellow subject switched ro les so that it was the researcher who was strapped into the ch air and the fellow subj ect who ordered the Teacher to continue—over the protests of th e researcher. Again, not one subject touched another shock lever. The extreme degree to which subjects in Milgram's studies obeyed the orders of authority was documented in yet another variatio n of the basic experiments. In this case, the Teacher faced two researchers who issu ed contradictory orders; one ordered the Teacher to terminate the shocks when the vi ctim cried out for release, while the other maintained that the experiment should go on. These conflicting instructions reliably produced what may have been the project's only humor: In tragicomic be-fuddlement and with eyes darting from one researcher to another, subjects woul d beseech the pair to agree on a single command to follow, \"Wait, wa it. Which is it going to be? One says stop, one says go.... Which is it!?\" When the researchers remained at loggerheads, the subjects tried frantically to determine who was the bigger boss. Failing this route to obedience with the authority, every subject finally followed his better instincts and ended the shocks. As in the other experimental variations, such a re sult would hardly be expected had the subjects' motivations invo lved some form of sadism or neurotic aggressiveness. 1 To Milgram's mind, evidence of a chilling phenomenon emerges repeatedly from his accumulated data. \"It is the extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority that constitutes the chief finding of the study\" (Milgram, 1974). There are sobering implications of th is finding for those concerned about the ability of another form of author ity—government—to extract frightening The basic experiment, as well as all these an d other variations on it, is presented in Milgram's highly readable Obedience to Authority, 1974. A review of much of the subsequent research on obedience can be found in Blass (1991, 1999) and in Miller, Collins, & Brief (1995). "},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"184 Chapter 6 levels of obedience fr om ordinary citizens. 2 Furthermore, the finding tells us something about the sheer strength of authority pre ssures in controlling our behavior. After witnessing Milgram's subjects squirming and sweating and suffering at their task, could anyone doubt the power of the force that held them there? For those whose doubts remain, the story of S. Brian Willson might prove instructive. On September 1, 1987, to protest U.S. shipme nts of military equipment to Nicaragua, Mr. Willson and two other men stretched thei r bodies across the railroad tracks leading out of the Naval Weapons Station in Concord, California. The protes ters were confident that their act would halt the scheduled trai n's progress that day, as they had notified navy and railroad officials of their intent three days before. But the civilian crew, which had been given orders not to stop, never even slowed the train, despite being able to see the protesters 600 feet ahea d. Although two of the men managed to scramble out of harm's way, Mr. Willson was not quick enough to avoid being struck and having both legs severed below the knee. Because navy medical corpsmen at the scene refused to treat him or allow him to be taken to the hospital in thei r ambulance, onlookers— including Mr. Willson's wife and son—were left to try to staunch the flow of blood for 45 minutes until a private ambulance arrived. Amazingly, Mr. Willson, who served four years in Vietnam, does not blame either the crewmen or the corpsmen for his misfortune; he points his finger, instead, at a system that constrained their actions through the pressure to obey. \"They were just doing what I did in 'Nam. They were following orders that are part of an insane policy. They're the fall guys.\" Although the crew members shared Mr. Willson's assessment of them as victims, they did not share his magnanimity. In what is perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the incident, the train crew filed suit against him, requesting punitive damages for the \"humiliation, mental anguish, and physical stress\" they suffered because he hadn't allowed them to carry out their orders without cutting off his legs. 2 In fact, Milgram first began his investiga tions in an attempt to understand how the German citizenry could have participated in the concentration camp destruction of millions of innocents during the years of Nazi ascendancy. After testing his experimental procedures in the United States, he had planned to take them to Germany, a country whose populace he was sure woul d provide enough obedience for a full-flown scientific analysis of the concept. The first eye-opening experiment in New Haven, Connecticut, however, make it clear that he could save his money and stay close to home. \"I found so much obedience,\" he sai d, \"I hardly saw the need of taking the experiment to Germany.\" More telling evidence, perhaps, of a w illingness to submit to authorized command within the American character comes from a national survey taken after the trial of Lieutenant William Galley, who ordered his sold iers to kill the inhabitants—infants and toddlers as well as their parents and gra ndparents—of My Lai, Vietnam (Kelman & Hamilton, 1989). A majority of Americans (51 percent) responded that if so ordered, they too would shoot all the residents of a Vietnamese village. But Americans have no monopoly on the need to obey authority. When Milgram's basic procedure was eventually repeated in Holla nd, Germany, Spain, Italy, Austra lia, and Jordan, the results were similar (see Meeus & Raaijmakers, 1986, for a review)."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Authority 185 THE ALLURES AND DANGERS OF BLIND OBEDIENCE Whenever we are faced with a potent motivator of human action, it is natural to expect that good reasons exist for the motivation. In the case of obedience to authority, even a brief consideration of human social orga nization offers justification aplenty. A multilayered and widely accepted system of authority confers an immense advantage upon a society. It allows the de velopment of sophist icated structures for production of resources, trade, defense, expansion, and social control that would otherwise be impossible. At the opposite end, the alternativ e is anarchy, a state hardly known for its beneficial effects on cultural groups and one that the social philosopher Thomas Hobbes assures us would render life \"s olitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\" Consequently, we are trained from birth to believe that obe dience to proper aut hority is right and disobedience is wrong. This message fills th e parental lessons, the schoolhouse rhymes, stories, and songs of our childhood and is carried forward in th e legal, military, and political systems we encounter as adults . Notions of submi ssion and loyalty to legitimate rule are accorded much value in each. Religious instruction co ntributes as well. The very first book of the Bible, for example, describes how failure to obey the ultimate authority resulted in the loss of paradise for Adam, Eve, and the rest of the human race. Should that particular metaphor prove too subtle, just a bit further into the Old Test ament, we can read—in what might be the closest biblical representation of the Milg ram experiment—the respectful account of Abraham's willingness to plunge a dagger th rough the heart of his young son because God, without any explanation, ordered it. We l earn in this story that the correctness of an action was not judged by such considerations as apparent senselessness, harmfulness, injustice, or usual moral st andards, but by the mere co mmand of a higher authority. Abraham's tormented ordeal was a test of obedience, and he—like Milgram's subjects, who perhaps had learned an early lesson from him—passed. Stories like those of Abraham and Milgram's subjects can tell us a great deal about obedience's power and value in our culture. In another sens e, however, the stories may be misleading. We rarely agonize to such a degree over the pros a nd cons of authority demands. In fact, our obedience frequently takes place in a click, whirr fashion with little or no conscious delibera tion. Information from a rec ognized authority can provide us a valuable shortcut for deci ding how to act in a situation. After all, as Milgram suggests, conforming to the dictates of authority figures has always had genuine practical advantages for us. Early on, these people (parents, teachers) knew more than we did, and we found that taking their advice proved beneficial—partly because of their greater wisdom and partly because they controlled our rewards and punishments. As adults, the sa me benefits persist for the same reasons, though the authority figures are now employ ers, judges, and gove rnment leaders. Because their positions speak of greater a ccess to information and power, it makes sense to comply with the wishes of properly consti tuted authorities. It makes so much sense, in fact, that we often do so when it makes no sense at all. "},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"186 Chapter 6 This paradox is, of course, the same one that attends all major weapons of influence. In this instance, once we realize that obedience to authority is mostly rewarding, it is easy to allow ourselves the conve nience of automatic obedience. The simultaneous blessing and curse of such blind obedience is its mech anical character. We don't have to think, therefore we don't. Although such mindless ob edience leads us to appropriate action most of the time, there will be conspic uous exceptions because we are reacting, not thinking. Let's take an example from one facet of our lives in which authority pressures are visible and strong: medicine. Health is enormously important to us. Thus, physicians, who possess great knowledge and influence in this vital area, hold the position of respected authorities. In addition, the medi cal establishment has a clearly terraced power and prestige structure. The various kinds of health workers well understand the level of their jobs in this structure, and they well underst and, too, that M.D.s sit at the top. No one may overrule a doctor's judgment in a case, except, perhaps, another doctor of higher rank. Consequently, a long-established tradition of automatic obedience to doctors' orders has develope d among health care staffs. The worrisome possibility arises, then, that when a physician makes a clear error, no one lower in the hierarchy will think to question it—precisely because, once a legitimate authority has given an order, subordinates stop thinking in the situation and start reacting. Mix this kind of click, whirr response into a complex hospital environment and mistakes are inevitable. Indeed, a st udy by the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration shows that, for patient medi cation alone, the average hospital has a 12 percent daily error rate. Errors in the medicine patients receive can occur for a variety of reasons. However, in their book Medication Errors: Causes and Prevention (1981), Temple University professors of pharmacy Michael Cohen and Neil Davis attribute much of the problem to the mindless deference given to the \"boss\" of a patient's case: th e attending physician. According to Cohen, \"in case after case, patients, nurses, pharmacists, and other physicians do not question the prescription.\" Take, for example, the strange case of the \"rectal earache\" reported by Cohen and Da vis. A physician ordered ear drops to be administered to the right ear of a patient su ffering pain and infecti on there. Instead of writing out completely the location \"Ri ght ear\" on the prescr iption, the doctor abbreviated it so that the instructions r ead \"place in R ear.\" Upon receiving the prescription, the duty nurse promptly put the required number of ear drops into the patient's anus. Obviously, rectal treatment of an earache made no sense, but neither the patient nor the nurse questioned it. The important lesson of th is story is that in many situations in which a legitimate authority has spoken, what would otherwise make sense is irrelevant. In these instances, we don't consider the si tuation as a whole but attend and respond to only one aspect of it. We are not the only species to give sometimes single-minded deference to those in authority positions. In monkey colonies, where rigid dominance hierarchies exist, beneficial innovations (for ex ample, learning how to use a stick to bring food into"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Authority 1 87 the cage area) do not spread quickly through the group unless they are taught first to a dominant animal. When a lower animal is ta ught the new concept first, the rest of the colony remains mostly oblivious to its va lue. One study, cited by Ardry (1970), on the introduction of new food tastes to Japanese monkeys provides a nice illustration. In one troop, a taste for caramels was developed by in troducing this new food into the diet of young peripherals, low on the status ladder. Th e taste for caramels inched slowly up the ranks: A year and a half later, only 51 per cent of the colony had acquired it, but still none of the leaders. Contrast this with wh at happened in a second troop where wheat was introduced first to the leader: Wh eat eating—to this point unknown to these monkeys—spread through the whole colony w ithin four hours. Very much the same thing happened in 1995 on the Chicago Bulls basketball team when the acknowledged leader and star, Michael Jord an, began eating three Energy Booster bars before each game. According to substitute player Steve Kerr, \"B. J. Armstrong [another non-star player] and I were the only ones eating them before. Then Michael eats some, and now everybody's eating them\" (Shappell, 1995). "},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"188 Chapter 6 Wherever our behaviors are governed in such an unthinking manner, we can be confident that there will be compliance professionals trying to take advantage. Returning to the field of medicine, we can see that advertisers have frequently commissioned the respect accorded doctors in our culture by hiring actors to play the roles of doctors speaking on behalf of the product. My favorite example was a TV commercial featuring the actor Robert Y oung warning people against the dangers of caffeine and recommending caffeine-free Sa nka brand coffee. The commercial was highly successful, selling so much Sanka that it was played for years in several versions. Why should this commercial prove so effec tive? Why on earth would we take Robert Young's word for the health consequences of decaffeinated coffee? Because— as the advertising agency that hired him knew perf ectly well—he was associated in the minds of the American public with Ma rcus Welby, M.D., the role he played in an earlier long- running television series. Objectively, it doe sn't make sense to be swayed by the comments of a man we know to be just an actor who used to play a doctor; but, practically, that man sold the Sanka. CONNOTATION NOT CONTENT From the first time I saw it, I found the most intriguing feature of Robert Young's Sanka commercial to be its ability to use the influe nce of the authority principle without ever providing a real authority. The appearance of authority was enough. This tells us something important about unthinking reacti ons to authority figures. When in a click, whirr mode, we are often as vulnerable to the sy mbols of authority as to the substance. Several of these symbols can reliably tri gger our compliance in the absence of the genuine substance of authority. Consequent ly, these symbols are employed extensively by those compliance professionals who are shor t on substance. Con artists, for example, drape themselves with the titles, the clothes, and the trappings of authority. They love nothing more than to emerge elegantly dressed from a fine automobile and to introduce themselves to their prospective \"marks\" as Doctor or Judge or Professor or Commissioner Someone. They understand that wh en they are so adorned their chances for compliance are greatly increased. Each of these three types of symbols of authority—titles, clothes, and trappings—has its own story and is worth a separate look. Titles Titles are simultaneously the most difficult and the easiest symbols of authority to acquire. To earn a title normally takes years of work and achievement. Yet, it is possible for somebody who has put in none of this effo rt to adopt the mere label and receive a kind of automatic deference. As we have see n, actors in TV commercials and con artists do it successfully all the time. "},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Authority 189 I recently talked with a friend—a faculty member at a well-know n eastern university— who provided a telling illustration of the way our actions are frequently more influenced by a title than by the nature of the person cl aiming it. My friend travels quite a bit and often finds himself chatting with strangers in ba rs, restaurants, and airports. He says that he has learned through much experience during these conversations never to use his title of professor. When he does, he finds th at the tenor of the interaction changes immediately. People who have been spontaneo us and interesting conversation partners for the previous half hour become respec tful, accepting, and dull. His opinions that before may have produced a lively exch ange now generate extended (and highly grammatical) statements of accord. Annoye d and slightly bewildered by the phenomenon—because as he says, \"I'm still the same guy they've been talking to for the last 30 minutes, right?\"—my friend now regul arly lies about his occupation in such situations. What an eccentric shift from the more t ypical pattern in which certain compliance practitioners lie about titles they don't truly have. Either way, however, such practiced dishonesty makes the same point about the ability of a symbol of authority to influence behavior. I wonder whether my professor friend—who is somewhat short—would be so eager to hide his title if he knew that, besides making strangers more accommodating, it also makes them see him as taller. Studies investigating the way in which authority status affects perceptions of size have found that pr estigious titles lead to height distortions. In one experiment conducted on five classes of Australian college students, a man was introduced as a visitor from Cambridge Univer sity in England. However, his status at Cambridge was represented differently in each of the classes. To one class, he was presented as a student; to a s econd class, a demonstrator; to another, a lecturer; to yet another, a senior lecturer; to a fifth, a professor. After he left the room, the class was asked to estimate his height. It was found that with each increase in status, the same man grew in perceived height by an average of a half-inch, so that as the \"professor\" he was seen as 2 1/2 inches taller than as the \"student\" (P. R. Wilson, 1968). Another study found that after winning an election, politicia ns become taller in the eyes of the citizenry (Higham & Garment, 1992). It is worth the time for a small detour to pursue this interesting connection between status and perceived size, as it shows up in a variety of ways. In one study in which children were asked to judge th e size of coins, for example, they most overestimated the size of the more valuable co ins (Bruner & Goodman, 1947). Adu lts are just as guilty of such distortions. In a study by Dukes and Bevan (1952), college students drew cards on which were printed monetary values rangi ng from $3.00 to -$3.00; the students won or lost the amount shown on the cards they pick ed. Afterward, they were asked to rate the size of each card. Although all th e cards were exactly the same size, those that had the extreme values—positive or negative—were s een as physically larg er. Thus, it is not necessarily the pleasantness of a thing that makes it seem bigger, it is its importance. "},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"190 Chapter 6 Because we see size and status as related, it is possible for certain individuals to benefit by substituting the former for the latter. In some animal societies, in which the status of an animal is assigned on the basis of domi nance, size is an important factor in determining which animal will achie ve which status level in the group. 3 Usually, in combat with a rival, the larger and more powerful animal wins. To avoid the harmful effects to the group of such physical conflict, however, many species employ methods that frequently involve more form than fracas. The two rivals confront each other with showy aggression displays that invariably include size-enhancing tricks. Various mammals arch their backs and bristle their coats; fish exte nd their fins and puff themselves up with water; birds unfurl a nd flutter their wings. Very often, this exhibition alone is enough to se nd one of the histrionic warriors into retreat leaving the contested status position to the seemingly larger and stronger rival. Fur, fins, and feathers. Isn't it interesting how these most delica te of parts can be exploited to give the impre ssion of substance and weight? There are two lessons for us here. One is specific to the association between size and status: The connection of those two features can be profitably empl oyed by individuals who are able to 3 Subhumans are not alone in this regard, even in modern times.

This possibility is precisely why con artists, even those of averag e or slightly above average he ight, commonly wear lifts in their shoes. The other lesson is more genera l: The outward signs of power and authority frequently may be counterfeited with the flimsi est of materials. Let' s return to the realm of titles for an example—an example that invol ves what, in several ways, is the scariest experiment I know. A group of researchers, composed of doctors and nurses with connections to three midwestern hospitals , became increasingly concerned with the extent of mechanical obedience to doctors' orde rs on the part of nurses. It seemed to the researchers that even highly trained and skill ed nurses were not usi ng that training or skill sufficiently to check on a doctor's j udgment; instead, when confronted with a physician's directives, they would simply defer. We saw how this process accounted for the case of the rectally ad ministered ear drops, but the midwestern researchers took things se veral steps further. First, they wanted to find out whether such cases were isolated in cidents or representative of a widespread phenomenon. Second, they wanted to examine the problem in the context of a serious treatment error: the gross over-p rescription of an unauthorized drug to a hospital patient. Finally, they wanted to see what would happe n if they physically removed the authority figure from the situation and substituted an unfamiliar voice on the phone, offering only the frailest evidence of author ity—the claimed title \"doctor.\" One of the researchers made an identical phone call to 22 separate nurses' stations on various surgical, medical, pediat ric, and psychiatric wards. He identified himself as a hospital physician and directed the answer ing nurse to give 20 milligrams of a drug (Astrogen) to a specific ward patient. There were four exce llent reasons for the nurse's caution in response to this order: (1) the prescription was transmitted by phone, in direct violation of hospital policy; (2) the medication itself wa s unauthorized. Astrogen had not been cleared for use nor pl aced on the ward stock list; (3) the prescribed dosage was obviously and dangerously excessive. The medica tion containers clearl y stated that the \"maximum daily dose\" was only 10 milligrams, ha lf of what had been ordered; (4) the directive was given by a man the nurse had neve r met, seen, or even talked with before on the phone. Yet, in 95 percen t of the instances, the nurses went straight to the ward medicine cabinet where they secured the or dered dosage of Astroge n and started for the patient's room to administer it. It was at this point that they were stopped by a secret observer, who revealed the na ture of the experiment (Hofling, Brotzman, Dalrymple, Graves, & Pierce, 1966). The results are frightening indeed. That 95 percent of regular staff nurses complied unhesitatingly with a patently improper instruction of this sort must give us all as potential hospital patients gr eat reason for concern. Given the U.S. Health Financing Care Administration estimate of a 12 percen t daily medication error rate in American hospitals, stays of longer than a week make it li kely that we will be re cipients of such an error. What the midwestern study shows is that the mistakes are hardly limited to the trivial slips in the administration of harmle ss ear drops or the like, but extend to grave and dangerous blunders. "},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"192 Chapter 6 In interpreting their unsettling findings, the researchers came to an instructive conclusion: In a real-life situation corres ponding to the experimental one, there would, in theory, be two professional intelligences, the doctor's and the nurse's, worki ng to ensure that a given procedure be undertaken in a manner be neficial to the patient or, at the very least, not detrimental to him [or her]. Th e experiment strongly suggests, however, that one of these intelligences is, for all practical purposes, nonfunctioning. (Hofling et al, 1966, p. 176) It seems that, in the face of a physician's directives, the nurses unhooked their \"professional intelligences\" and moved to a click, whirr form of responding. None of their considerable medical training or know ledge was engaged in the decision about what to do. Instead, because obedience to legiti mate authority had always been the most preferred and efficient action in their work setting, they were willi ng to err on the side of automatic obedience. It is all the more instru ctive that they have traveled so far in this direction that their error had come in response not to genuin e authority but to its most easily falsified symbol—a bare title. 4 Perhaps as dismaying as the mechanical de ference given to indi viduals whose titles bespeak authority is the evidence for a mechani cal resistance to the ideas of individuals whose titles suggest a lack of authority. In the realm of scholarly publication, a revealing study was done by psychologists Dougl as Peters and Ste phen Ceci (1982). They took 12 articles that had been publishe d 18 to 32 months earlier by authors from prestigious universities and, changing nothing but the names and affiliations of the authors to those of unknowns from \"Tri-Val ley Center for Human Potential,\" they resubmitted the articles in manuscript form to the journals that had already published them. Nine of the doctored articles went through the review pr ocess undetected and, remarkably, eight were rejected, even though each had been publishe d shortly before by the same journal when it had been submitted by researchers with more prestigious reputations and affiliations. A similar, but le ss scientific, experiment was tried by a popular writer who typed word-f or-word Jerzy Kosinski's novel Steps and sent the manuscript to 28 literary agencies and publishing houses 10 years after the book had sold nearly a half million copies and had won the National Book Award. The manuscript, now carrying the name of an unkno wn, was rejected as inadequate by all 28 organizations including Rando m House, the novel's original publisher (C. Ross, 1979). 4 Additional data collect ed in the Hofling et al. study suggest that nurses may not be conscious of the extent to which the title \"doctor\" sways their judgments and actions. A separate group of 33 nurses and student nurse s were asked what they would have done in the experimental situation. Contrary to the actual findings, onl y two predicted that they would have given th e medication as ordered.

I occasionally return home to visit family and the like. As in most pl aces these days, most of the small Italian specialty stores are gone, having been replaced by larger supermarkets. My mother sent me supermarket shopping during a visit for a load of canned tomatoes, and I noticed that nearly all the cans of Furmano Italian diced tomatoes were sold out. Searching a bit on the shelf immediately beneath the almost empty shelf, I found a full shelf (loaded, even!) of Furman brand diced tomatoes. Looking closely at the labels, I realized that Furmano is Furman. The company had just ad ded an \"o\" to its name when distributing some of its products. I guess it must be b ecause, when selling Italian-style foods, you're perceived as more of an authority if your name ends in a vowel. Author's note: The man who wrote this report also co mmented that the added letter \"o \" was doing double duty as an influence trig ger in that store. Not only did it lend authority to the manufacturer, in an \"Ita lian ghetto,\" it made the company appear similar to its customers. Clothes A second kind of authority symbol that can trigger our mechanical compliance is clothing. Though more tangible than a title, the cloak of authority is every bit as fake- able. Police bunco files bulge with records of con artists whose methods include the quick change. In chameleon style, they adopt the hospital whites, priestly black, army green, or police blue that the situation requi res for maximum advantage. Only too late do their victims realize that the garb of authority is hardly its guarantee. A series of studies by social psychologi st Leonard Bickman (1974) indicates how difficult it can be to resist requests that come from figures in authority attire. Bickman's basic procedure was to ask passersby on the st reet to comply with some sort of odd request (for example, to pick up a discarded paper bag or to stand on the other side of a bus-stop sign). In half of the instances, the requester—a young man— was dressed in ordinary street clothes: th e rest of the time, he wore a security guard's uniform. Regardless of the type of request, many mo re people obeyed the requester when he was wearing the guard costume. Similar results have been obtained when the uniformed requester was female (Bushman, 1988). Especially revealing was one version of the experiment in which the requester stopped pedestrians and pointed to a man standing by a parkin g meter 50 feet away. The requester, whether dressed normally or as a se curity guard, always said the same thing to the pedestrian, \"You see that guy ove r there by the meter? He's overparked but doesn't have any change. Give him a dime !\" The requester then turned a corner "},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"194 Chapters and walked away so that by the time the pede strian reached the meter, the requester was out of sight. The power of his uniform lasted, however, even after he was long gone: Nearly all of the pedestrians complied with his directive when he wore the guard costume, but fewer than half did so when he was dressed normally. 5 It is interesting to note that, later on, Bickman found college students guessed with considerable accuracy the perc entage of compliance that o ccurred in the experiment when the requester wore street clothes (50 pe rcent versus the actual 42 percent); yet, the students greatly underestimated the percen tage of compliance when he was in uniform—63 percent versus the actual 92 percent (Bickman, 1974). Less blatant in its connotation than a uniform, but nonetheless effective, is another kind of attire that has traditionally indicated authority status in our culture: the well-tailored business suit. It, too, can evoke a telling form of deferenc e from total strangers. In a study conducted in Texas, for instance, rese archers arranged for a 31-year-old man to violate the law by crossing the street against the traffic light on a variety of occasions. In half of the cases, he was dressed in a freshly pressed business suit and tie; on the other occasions, he wore a work shirt and trousers. The researchers watched from a distance and counted the number of pedestri ans waiting at the corner who followed the man across the street. Like the children of Hamlin who crowded after the Pied Piper, 3'/2 times as many people swept into tra ffic behind the suited ja ywalker (Lefkowitz, Blake, & Mouton, 1955). In this case, though, the magic came not from his pipe but from his pinstripes. It is noteworthy that the two types of aut hority apparel shown by these studies to be influential—the guard uniform and the bus iness suit—are combined deftly by confidence artists in a fraud called the bank examiner scheme. The target of the swindle can be anyone, but elderly persons living al one are preferred. The con begins when a man dressed in a properly conservative three- piece business suit appears at the door of a likely victim. Everything about the con man's clothing speaks of propriety and respectability. The white shirt is starched; th e wingtip shoes glow darkly. His suit is not trendy but classic: the lapels are three inches wide—no more , no less; the cloth is heavy and substantial, even in July; the t ones are muted—business blue, business gray, business black. He explains to his intended victim—perhap s a widow he secretly followed home from the bank a day or two earli er—that he is a professiona l bank examiner who, in the course of auditing the books of her bank, ha s found some seeming irregularities. He thinks he has spotted the culprit, a bank o fficer who is regularly doctoring reports of transactions in certain accounts. He says th at the widow's account may be one of these, but he can't be sure until he has hard evidence; therefore, he has come to ask 5 A study by Mauro (1984) may explain why th e requester in uniform was effective, even after he had left the scene.

Would she help out by withdrawing her savings so a team of examiners and responsible bank officials can trace the record of the transaction as it passes across the suspect's desk? Often, the appearance and presentation of \"b ank examiner\" are so impressive that the victim never thinks to check on their validity with even a simple phone call. Instead, she drives to the bank, withdraws all her money, and returns home with it to wait with the examiner for word on the success of the trap. When the message comes, it is delivered by a uniformed \"bank guard\" who arrives afte r closing hours to announce that all is well—apparently, the widow's account was no t one of those being tampered with. Greatly relieved, the examiner offers gr acious thanks and, since the bank is now conveniently closed, instructs the guard to return the wido w's money to the vault, to save her the trouble of doing so the next day. With smiles and handshakes all around, the guard leaves with the funds while the examiner expresses a few more minutes of thanks before he, too, exits. Naturally, as the victim eventually discovers, the \"guard\" is no more a guard than the \"examiner\" is an examiner. What they are is a pair of bunco artists who have recognized the capacity of carefully counterfeited uniforms to click us into mesmerized compliance with \"authority.\" Trappings Aside from its function in uniforms, clothing can symbolize a more generalized type of authority when it serves an ornamental pur pose. Finely styled and expensive clothes carry an aura of status and position, as do similar trapping s such as jewelry and cars. The last of these status symbols is particul arly interesting in the United States where \"the American love affair with the automobile\" gives it unusual significance. According to the findings of a study done in the San Francisco Bay area, owners of prestige autos receive a special kind of deference from others. The experimenters discovered that motorists would wait signif icantly longer before honking their horns at a new, luxury car stopped in front of a green traffic light than at an older, economy model. The motorists had little patience with the economy-car driver: Nearly all sounded their horns, and the majority of these did so more than once; two simply rammed into the rear bumper. So intimidating was the aura of the prestige automobile, however, that 50 percen t of the motorists waited respec tfully behind it, never touching their horns until it moved on (Doob & Gross, 1968). Later the researchers asked college student s what they would have done in such situations. Compared to the actual findings of the experiment, the students consistently underestimated the time it would take them to honk at the luxury car. The male students were especially inaccurate, feeling that they would honk faster at the prestige-than at the economy-car driver; of course, the study itse lf showed just the opposite. Note the similarity of this pattern to much other rese arch on authority pressu res. As in Milgram's research, the midwestern hospital nur ses' study, and the security guard "},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"196 Chapter 6 uniform experiment, people were unable to pr edict correctly how th ey or others would react to authority influence. In each instance, the effect of such influence was grossly underestimated. This property of authority st atus may account for much of its success as a compliance device. Not only does it wo rk forcefully on us, but it does so unexpectedly. DEFENSE One protective tactic we can use against auth ority status is. to remove its element of surprise. Because we typically misperceive the profound impact of authority (and its symbols) on our actions, we become insuffi ciently cautious abou t its presence in compliance situations. A fundamental form of de fense against this problem, therefore, is a heightened awareness of authority power. When this awareness is coupled with a recognition of how easily author ity symbols can be faked, the benefit will be a properly guarded approach to situations i nvolving authority influence attempts. Sounds simple, right? And in a way it is. A better understanding of the workings of authority influence should help us resist it. Yet, there is a perverse complication— the familiar one inherent in all weapons of influe nce: We shouldn't want to resist authority altogether or even most of the time. Gene rally, authority figures know what they are talking about. Physicians, judge s, corporate executives, legisl ative leaders, and the like have typically gained thei r positions through superior knowledge and judgment. Thus, as a rule, their directives offer excellent counsel. Authorities, then, are freque ntly experts; indeed, one di ctionary definition of an authority is an expert. In most cases, it w ould be foolish to try to substitute our less informed judgments for those of an expert, an authority. At the same time, we have seen in settings ranging from street corners to hospitals that it would be foolis h to rely on authority direction in all cases. The trick is to be able to recognize without much strain or vigilance when authority directives ar e best followed and when they are not. Authoritative Authority Posing two questions to ourselves can help enormously to determine when authority directives should and should not be followe d. The first question to ask when we are confronted with what appears to be an authority figure's influence attempt is \"Is this authority truly an expert?\" This question fo cuses our attention on tw o crucial pieces of information: the authority's credentials and the relevance of those credentials to the topic at hand. By turning in this simple way to the evidence for authority status, we can avoid the major pitfalls of automatic defere nce. An illustration or two is in order. Let's examine the highly successful Robert Young Sanka commercial in this light. If, rather than responding to his \"Marcu s Welby, M.D.\" association, people had "},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Authority 197 focused on Young's actual status as an aut hority, I am confident that the commercial would not have had so long and productiv e a run. Obviously, Robert Young did not possess a physician's training or knowledge. We all know that. What he did possess, however, was a physician's title, \"M.D.\" Now, clearly, it wa s an empty title, connected to him in our minds through the device of pl ayacting. We all know that, but isn't it fascinating how, when we are whirring along, what is obvious often doesn't matter unless we pay specific attention to it? That is why the \"Is this authority truly an expert?\" question can be so valuable— it brings our attention to the obvious. It m oves us effortlessly away from a focus on possibly meaningless symbols toward a consid eration of genuine authority credentials. What's more, the question forces us to di stinguish between rele vant authorities and irrelevant authorities. This distinction is easy to forget when the push of authority pressure is combined with the rush of m odern life. The Texas pedestrians who bustled into city traffic behind a business-suited ja ywalker are prime exampl es. Even if the man were the business authority hi s clothes suggested he might be, he was unlikely to be a greater authority on cr ossing the street than those w ho followed him into traffic. Still, they did follow, as if his label, authority, overwhelmed the vital difference between relevant and irrelevant forms. Had they bothered to ask themselves whether he represented a true expert in the situati on, someone whose actions indicated superior knowledge, I expect the result would have been quite different. The same process applies to Robert Young, a man who was not without expertise. He had a long career with many achievements in a difficult busin ess. However, his skills and knowledge were as an actor, not a doctor. When, in viewing the famous coffee commercial, we focus on his true credentials, we realize quick ly that he should be no more believed than would be any other successful actor w ho claims that Sanka is healthful. Sly Sincerity Suppose, though, that we are confronted with an authority who we determine is a relevant expert. Before submitting to authority influence, we should ask a second simple question, \"How truthful can we expect the expert to be?\" Authorities, even the best informed, may not present their information honestly to us; therefore, we need to consider their trustworthine ss in the situation. Most of the time we do. We allow ourselves to be swayed more by experts w ho seem to be impartial than by those who have something to gain by convincing us (Eagly, Wood, & Chaiken, 1978); research has shown this to be true around the world (McGuinnies & Ward, 1980). By wondering how an expert stands to benefit from our co mpliance, we give ourselves another safety net against undue and automatic influence. Even knowledgeable authorities in a field will not persuade us until we are satisfied that their messages represent the facts faithfully. When asking ourselves about an authority's trustworthiness, we should keep in mind a little tactic compliance practitioners often use to assure us of their sincerity: They will argue somewhat against their own in terests. Correctly practiced, this "},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"198 Chapter 6 approach can be a subtle yet effective de vice for \"proving\" their honesty. Perhaps they will mention a small shortcoming in their position or product (\"Oh, the disadvantages of Benson & Hedges\"). Invariably though, the draw back will be a secondary one that is easily overcome by more significant advantag es—\"Listerine, the taste you hate three times a day\"; \"Avis: We're number two, but we try harder\"; \"L'Oreal, a bit more expensive and worth it.\" By establishing th eir basic truthfulness on minor issues, the compliance professionals who use this ploy can then be more believable when stressing the important aspects of their argument (Hunt, Domzal, & Kernan, 1981; Settle & Gorden, 1974; Smith & Hunt, 1978). I have seen this approach used with devastating effect in a place that few of us recognize as a compliance setting—a restaura nt. It is no secret that, because of shamelessly low wages, servers in restaurant s must supplement their earnings with tips. Leaving the sine qua non of good service aside, the mo st successful waiters and waitresses know certain tricks for increasing tips. They also know that the larger a customer's bill, the larger the amount of mone y they are likely to receive in a standard gratuity. In these two regards, then—buildin g the size of the customer's charge and building the percentage of that charge that is given as a tip—servers regularly act as compliance agents. Hoping to find out how they operate, I applied for a position as a waiter at several fairly expensive restaurants. Without experience, though, the best I could do was to land a busboy job that, as things turned out, pr ovided me a propitious vantage point from which to watch and analyze the action. Before long, I realized what the other employees already knew: that the most successful wa iter in the place was Vincent who somehow arranged for patrons to order more and tip hi gher. The other servers were not even close to him in weekly earnings. So I began to linger in my duties around Vin cent's tables to observe his technique. I quickly learned that his styl e was to have no single styl e. He had a repertoire of approaches, each ready to be used under th e appropriate circumstances. When the customers were a family, he was effervescen t—even slightly clow nish— directing his remarks as often to the children as the a dults. With a young couple on a date, he became formal and a bit imperious in an attemp t to intimidate the young man (to whom he spoke exclusively) into orderi ng and tipping lavishly. With an older, married couple, he retained the formality but dropped the superior air in favor of a respectful orientation to both members of the couple. Should the patr on be dining alone, Vincent selected a friendly demeanor—cordial, conversational, and warm. Vincent reserved the trick of seeming to argue against his own interests for large parties of 8 to 12 people. His technique was veined with genius. When it was time for the first person, normally a woman, to order, he went into his act. No matter what she elected, Vincent reacted identically: His brow fu rrowed, his hand hovered above his order pad, and after looking quickly over his shoulder for the manager, he leaned conspiratorially toward the table to report for all to hear \"I'm afraid that is not as good "},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Authority 199 tonight as it normally is. Might I recommend instead th e___or the___?\" (At this point, Vincent suggested a pair of menu items that were slightly le ss expensive than the dish the patron had selected initially .) \"They are both ex cellent tonight.\" With this single maneuver, Vincent engaged se veral important principles of influence. First, even those who did not take his suggestions felt th at Vincent had done them a favor by offering valuable information to he lp them order. Everyone felt grateful, and consequently, the rule for reciprocity would work in his favor when it came time for them to decide on his gratuity. Besides hi king the percentage of his tip, Vincent's maneuver also placed him in a favorable pos ition to increase the size of the party's order. It established him as an authority on the current stores of the house: he clearly knew what was and wasn't good that night. Moreover—and here is where seeming to argue against his own interests comes in—it proved him to be a trustworthy informant because he recommended dishes that were slightly less expensive than the one originally ordered. Rather than trying to line his own pockets, he seemed to have the customers' best interests at heart. To all appearances, he was at once knowledg eable and honest, a combination that gave him great credibility. Vincent was quick to expl oit the advantage of this credible image. When the party had finished giving their food orders, he would say, \"Very well, and would you like me to suggest or select wine to go with your meals?\" As I watched the scene repeated almost nightly, there was a notable consistency to the customer's reaction—smiles, nods, and, for th e most part, general assent. Even from my vantage point, I could read their thoughts from their faces. \"Sure,\" the customers seemed to say, \"You know what's good here, and you're obviously on our side. Tell us what to get.\" Looking pleased, Vincent, who did know his vintages, would respond with some excellent (and costly) choice s. He was similarly persuasive when it came time for dessert decisions. Patrons who otherwise would have passed up the dessert course or shared with a friend we re swayed to partake fully by Vincent's rapturous descriptions of th e baked Alaska and chocolate mousse. Who, after all, is more believable than a demonstrat ed expert of proven sincerity? By combining the factors of reciprocity and credible authority into a single, elegant maneuver, Vincent was able to inflate substa ntially both the percentage of his tip and the base charge on which it was figured. His proceeds from this trick were handsome indeed. Notice, though, that much of his prof it came from an apparent lack of concern for personal profit. Seeming to argue against hi s financial interests served those interests extremely well. 6 This same strategy can be used effectively in a variety of other situations as well. For example, one researcher found that letters of recommendation sent to the personnel directors of major corporations produced th e most favorable results for job candidates when the letters contained one unflatte ring comment about the candidates in an otherwise wholly positive set of specific remarks (Knouse, 1983). "},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"READER'S REPORT 6.2 From a Young Businessman About two years ago, I was trying to sell my old car. One day I passed a used car lot with a sign reading, \"We will sell your car for more.\" Just what I wanted, I thought; so, I stopped in to talk with the owner. I told him I wanted to get about $3,000 for my old car, and he said he thought I should be as king for a lot more because it was worth at least $3,500. This came as a real surprise to me because the way their consignment system worked the larger my asking price fo r the car, the less mone y was left over for them to keep after they sold it to somebody. By telling me to ask for more than $3,000, they were cutting off their own profits. Just like your Vincent the waiter example, they were seeming to argue against their own in terests so I'd see them as trustworthy authorities, but I didn't realiz e this until much later. A nyway, I went along with the owner's idea that my car was worth more than I'd first thought, and set my asking price at $3,500. After they'd had my car on their lot for a couple of days, they called saying that someone was really interested in it but that the price was a little too high. Would I be willing to drop my price by $200 to sell the car? Convinced that they had my interests at heart, I agreed. The next day they called b ack to say the buyer's financing had fallen through and that he couldn't buy the car. In th e next two weeks, I got two more calls from the dealership, each asking me to dr op my price $200 to seal a sale to some customer. Both times I OK'd it because I stil l believed they were trustworthy. But each time, the alleged deal fell through. I was suspicions enough to call a friend whose family was in the car business. He said this was an old trick designed to get sellers like me to reduce their asking prices to super low levels, giving the dealership big profits when they finally sold the car. So, I went over there and took my car. As I was leaving, they were still trying to persuade me to let them keep it because they had a \"hot prospect\" they were sure would buy it if I'd only knock off another $200. Author's note: Once again, we see the influence of the contrast principle combining with the principle of primary interest. In this case, after the $3,500 figure was set, each $200 nick seemed small in comparison. SUMMARY • In the Milgram studies of obedience we can see evidence of strong pressure in our society for compliance with the requests of an authority. Acting c ontrary to their own preferences, many normal, psychologically he althy individuals were willing to deliver dangerous and severe levels of pain to another person because they were directed to do so by an authority figure. The strength of this tendency to obey legitimate authorities comes from systematic socialization practices de- "},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Authority 201 signed to instill in members of society the perception that such obedience constitutes correct conduct. In addition, it is frequently adaptive to obey the dictates of genuine authorities because such individuals usually possess high levels of knowledge, wisdom, and power. For these reasons, deference to auth orities can occur in a mindless fashion as a kind of decision-making shortcut. • When reacting to authority in an automatic fashion, there is a tendency to do so in response to the mere symbols of authority rath er than to its substance. Three kinds of symbols that have been shown by research to be effective in this regard are titles, clothing, and automobiles. In separate studi es investigating the influence of these symbols, individuals possessing one or a nother of them (and no other legitimizing credentials) were accorded more deference or obedience by those they encountered. Moreover, in each instance, individuals who deferred or obeyed underestimated the effect of authority pressures on their behaviors. • It is possible to defend ourselves against the detrimental effects of authority influence by asking two questions: Is this authority trul y an expert? How trut hful can we expect this expert to be? The first question directs our attention away from symbols and toward evidence for authority status. The second advises us to cons ider not just the expert's knowledge in the situation but also his or her trustworthiness. With regard to this second consideration, we should be al ert to the trust-en hancing tactic in which communicators first provide some mildly negative informati on about themselves. Through this strategy they create a perception of honesty that ma kes all subsequent information seem more credible to observers. STUDY QUESTIONS Content Mastery 1.

CHESTERTON "},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"The city of Mesa, Arizona, is a suburb in the Phoenix area where I live. Perhaps the most notable features of Me sa are its sizable Mormon po pulation—next to Salt Lake City, the largest in the world—and a huge Mo rmon temple located on exquisitely kept grounds in the center of the city. Alt hough I had appreciated the landscaping and architecture from a distance, I had never been interested enough in the temple to go inside, until the day I read a newspaper article that told of a special inner sector of Mormon temples to which no one has access but faithful members of the church. Even potential converts must not see it; however, there is one exception to the rule. For a few days immediately after a temple is newly constructed, non-members are allowed to tour the entire structure, including th e otherwise restricted section. The newspaper story reported th at the Mesa temple had be en recently refurbished and that the renovations had b een extensive enough to clas sify it as \"new\" by church standards. Thus, for the next several days only, non-Mormon visitors could see the temple area traditionally banned to them. I remember quite well the effect this article had on me: I immediately resolved to take a tour; but when I phoned a friend to ask if he wanted to come along, I came to understand so mething that changed my decision just as quickly. After declining the invitation, my friend wonde red why / seemed so intent on a visit. I was forced to admit that, no, I had never been inclined toward the id ea of a temple tour before, that I had no questions about the Morm on religion I wanted answered, that I had no general interest in church architecture, and that I expected to find nothing more spectacular or stirring than what I might see at a number of ot her churches in the area. It became clear as I spoke that th e special lure of the temple had a sole cause: If I did not experience the restricted sector soon, I w ould never again have the chance. Something that, on its own merits, held little appeal for me had become decidedly more attractive merely because it was rapidl y becoming less available. LESS IS BEST AND LOSS IS WORST ________________________ I count myself far from alone in this weakness. Almost everyone is vulnerable to the scarcity principle in some form. Take as evidence the experience of Florida State University students who, like most undergraduat es when surveyed, rated the quality of their campus cafeteria food uns atisfactory. Nine days later, according to a second survey, they had changed their minds. Someth ing had happened to make them like their cafeteria's food significantly better than befo re. Interestingly, the event that caused them to shift their opinions had nothi ng to do with the quality of the food service, which had not changed a whit. But its availability had. On the day of the second survey, the students had learned that, because of a fire, they could not eat at the cafeteria for the next two weeks (West, 1975). 204"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Scarcity 205 Collectors of everything from baseball cards to antiques are keenly aware of the scarcity principle's influence in determining the worth of an item. As a rule, if an item is rare or becoming rare, it is more valuable. Espe cially enlightening on the importance of scarcity in the collectibles market is the phenomenon of the \"precious mistake.\" Flawed items—a blurred stamp or double-struck coin—a re sometimes the most valued of all, Thus, a stamp carrying a three-eyed likene ss of George Washingt on is anatomically incorrect, aesthetically unappeal ing, and yet highly sought after. There is instructive irony here: Imperfections that would otherw ise make for rubbish make for prized possessions when they bring along an abiding scarcity. Since my own encounter with the scarcity principle— that opportunities seem more valuable to us when they are less available —I have begun to notice its influence over a whole range of my actions. For instance, I rou tinely will interrupt an interesting face-to- face conversation to answer the ring of an unkno wn caller. In such a situation, the caller possesses a compelling feature that my face-to-face partner does not—potential unavailability. If I don't take the call, I might miss it (and the information it carries) for good. Never mind that the present conversati on may be highly engaging or important— much more than I could reasonably expect an average phone call to be. With each unanswered ring, the phone interaction becomes less retrievable. For that reason and for that moment, I want it more than the other conversation. People seem to be more motivated by the thought of losing some thing than by the thought of gaining something of equal value. For instance, college students experienced much stronger emotions when asked to im agine losses as opposed to gains in their romantic relationships or in their grade point averages (Ketelaar, 1995). Especially under conditions of risk and uncertainty, the threat of potential loss plays a powerful role in human decision making (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981; De Dreu & McCusker, 1997). Health researchers Alexander Rothma n and Peter Salovey have applied this insight to the medical arena, where individuals are frequently urged to undergo tests to detect existing illnesses (e.g., mammography procedures, HIV screenings, cancer self- examinations). Because such tests involve th e risk that a disease will be found and the uncertainty that it will be cured, messages stressing potential losses are most effective (Rothman & Salovey, 1997; Rothman, Martin o, Bedell, Detweiler, & Salovey, 1999). For example, pamphlets advising young wome n to check for breast cancer through self- examinations are significantly more successful if they state their cas e in terms of what stands to be lost rather than gained (M ey-erwitz & Chaiken, 1987). In a similar vein, physicians' letters to smokers describing the numb er of years of life that will be lost if they don't quit are more effective than letters describing the number of years that will be gained if they do quit (Wilson, Kaplan, & Schneiderman, 1987; Wilson, Purdon, & Wallston, 1988). Limited Numbers With the scarcity principle operating so pow erfully on the worth we assign things, it is natural that compliance professionals will do some similar operating of their "},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"206 Chapter 7 own. Probably the most straight forward use of the scarcity principle occurs in the \"limited-number\" tactic in which a customer is informed that a certain product is in short supply that cannot be guaranteed to last long. During the tim e I was researching compliance strategies by infiltrating va rious organizations, I saw the limited-number tactic employed repeatedly in a range of situations: \"The re aren't more than five convertibles with this engine left in the st ate. And when they're gone, that's it, 'cause we're not making 'em anymore.\" \"This is one of only two unsold corner lots in the entire development. You wouldn't want the other one; it's got a nasty east-west exposure.\" \"You may want to think se riously about buying more th an one case today because production is backed way up and there's no telling when we'll get any more in.\" Sometimes the limited-number information was true, sometimes it was wholly false. In each instance, however, the intent was to convi nce customers of an item's scarcity and thereby increase its immediate value in thei r eyes. I admit to de veloping a grudging admiration for the practitioners who made th is simple device work in a multitude of ways and styles. I -was most impressed, however, with a particular version that extended the basic approach to its logical extreme by selling a piece of merchandise at its scarcest point—when it seemingly could no longer be had. The tactic was played to perfection in one appliance st ore I investigated where 30 to 50 percent of the stock was regularly listed on sale. Suppos e a couple in the store seeme d, from a distance, to be moderately interested in a certain sale item. There are all sorts of cues that tip off such interest—closer-than-normal examination of the appliance, a casual look at any instruction booklets associated with the appl iance, discussions held in front of the appliance, but no attempt to seek out a salesperson fo r further information. After observing the couple so engaged, a salespers on might approach and say, \"I see you're interested in this model he re, and I can understand why: it' s a great machine at a great price. But, unfortunately, I so ld it to another couple not more than 20 minutes ago. And, if I'm not mistaken, it was the last one we had.\" The customers' disappointment registers unmis takably. Because of its lost availability, the appliance suddenly becomes more attractive. Typically, on e of the customers asks if there is any chance that an unsold model st ill exists in the store's back room or warehouse or other location. \"Well,\" the salesper son allows, \"that is possible, and I'd be willing to check. But do I understand that this is the model you want and if I can get it for you at this price, you'll take it?\" Therein lies the beauty of the technique. In accord with the scarcity principle the customers are asked to commit to buying the appliance when it looks least available and therefore most desirable. Many customers do agree to purchase at this singularly vulnerable time . Thus, when the salesperson (invariably) returns with the news that an additional supply of the appliance has been found, it is also with a pen and sales contract in hand. Th e information that the desired model is in good supply actually may make some customer s find it less attractive again (Schwarz, 1984), although by then the business transacti on has progressed too far for most people to renege. The purchase decision made and co mmitted to publicly at an earlier, crucial point still holds. They buy. "},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Scarcity 207 Time Limits Related to the limited-number technique is th e \"deadline\" tactic in which some official time limit is placed on the customer's opportunity to get what the compliance professional is offering. Much like my expe rience with the Mormon temple's inner sanctum, people frequently find themselves doing what they wouldn't much care to do simply because the time to do so is running out. The adept merchandiser makes this tendency pay off by arranging and publicizing cu stomer deadlines that generate interest where none may have existed before. Concentr ated instances of this approach often occur in movie advertising. In fact, I recen tly noticed that one theater owner, with remarkable singleness of purpose, had manage d to invoke the scarcity principle three separate times in just five words of copy: \"Exclusive, limited engagement ends soon!\" A variant of the deadline tactic is much fa vored by some face-to-face, high-pressure sellers because it carries the ultimate decision deadline: right now. Customers"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"208 Chapter 7 are often told that unless they make an immediate decision to buy, they will have to purchase the item at a higher price later or th ey will be unable to purchase it at all. A prospective health-club member or automob ile buyer might Learn that the deal offered by the salesperson is good for that one time only; should the customer leave the premises, the deal is off. One large child-p ortrait photography comp any urges parents to buy as many poses and copies as they can afford because \"stocking limitations force us to burn the unsold pictures of your childre n within 24 hours.\" A door-to-door magazine solicitor might say that salespeople are in the customer's area for just a day; after that, they, and the customer's chance to buy their magazine package, will be long gone. A home vacuum cleaner operation I infiltrated inst ructed its sales trainees to claim that, \"I have so many other people to see that I have the time to visit a family only once. It's company policy that even if you decide later that you want this machine, I can't come back and sell it to you.\" This, of course, is nonsense; the company and its representatives are in the business of maki ng sales, and any customer who called for another visit would be accommodated gladly. As the company sales manager impressed on his trainees, the true purpose of the \"can 't come back\" claim has nothing to do with reducing overburdened sales sche dules. It is to \"keep the prospects from taking the time to think the deal over by scaring them into believing they can't have it later, which makes them want it now.\" PSYCHOLOGICAL REACTANCE The evidence, then, is clear. Compliance pract itioners' reliance on scarcity as a weapon of influence is frequent, wi de-ranging, systematic, and diverse. Whenever this is the case with a weapon of influence, we can be assured that the principle involved has notable power in directing human action. With the scarcity principl e, that power comes from two major sources. The first is familiar. Like the other weapons of influence, the scarcity principle trades on our weakness for shortcuts. The weakness is, as before, an enlightened one. We know that the things that are difficult to get are typically better than those that are easy to get (Lynn, 1989). As such, we can often use an item's availability to help us quickly and correc tly decide on its quality. Thus, one reason for the potency of the scarcity principle is that, by following it, we are usually and efficiently right. 1 In addition, there is a unique, sec ondary source of power within the scarcity principle: As oppor tunities become less available, we lose freedoms. And we hate to lose the freedoms we already have. Th is desire to preser ve our established 'Without wishing to minimize the advantage of this type of shor tcut or the dangers associated with it, I should note that these advantages and dangers are essentially the same ones that we have examined in previ ous chapters. Accordingly, I will not focus on this theme in the remainder of the present chapter, except to say at this point that the key to properly using the shortcut feature of scarc ity is to be alert to the distinction between naturally occurring, honest scarcity and th e fabricated variety favored by certain compliance practitioners. "},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Scarcity 209 prerogatives is the centerpiece of psychol ogical reactance theory, developed by psychologist Jack Brehm to e xplain the human response to diminishing personal control '. W. Brehm, 1966; S. S. Brehm & J. W. Brehm, 1981). According to the theory whenever free choice is limited or threatened, the need to retain our freedoms makes us want them (as well as the goods and services associated with them) significantly ore than before. Therefore, when increasing scar city-or anything else —interferes with our prior access to some item, we will react against the interference by wanting and trying to possess the item more than we did before. As simple as the kernel of the theory s eems, its shoots and roots curl extensively through much of the social environmen t. From the garden of young love to "},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"210 Chapter 7 the jungle of armed revolution to the fruits of the marketplace, impressive amounts of our behavior can be explained by examini ng the tendrils of psyc hological reactance. Before beginning such an examination, though, it would be helpful to determine when people first show the desire to fight against restrict ions of their freedoms. Child psychologists have traced the tendency back to the age of 2—a time identified as a problem by parents and widely known to them as \"the terrible twos.\" Most parents attest to seeing more contrary behavior in their children around this period. Two-year- olds seem masters of the art of resistance to outside pressure, especially from their parents. Tell them one thi ng, they do the oppos ite; give them one toy, they want another; pick them up against their will, th ey wriggle and squirm to be put down; put them down agains: their will, they claw and struggle to be carried. One Virginia-based study nicely captured the style of terrible twos among boys who averaged 24 months in age (S. S. Br ehm & Weintraub, 1977). The boys accompanied their mothers into a room containing two e qually attractive toys. The toys were always arranged so that one stood ne xt to a transparent Plexigla s barrier and the other stood behind the barrier. For some of the boys, th e Plexiglas sheet was only a foot high— forming no real barrier to the toy behind it, since the boys could easily reach over the top. For the other boys, however, the Plexigla s was 2 feet high, e ffectively blocking their access to one toy unless they went ar ound the barrier. The re searchers wanted to see how quickly the toddlers would make c ontact with the toys under these conditions. Their findings were clear. When the barrier was too short to restrict access to the toy behind it, the boys showed no special preference for either of the toys; on the average, the toy next to the barrier was touched just as quickly as the one behind it. When the barrier was high enough to be a true obstacl e, however, the boys we nt directly to the obstructed toy, making contact w ith it three times faster than with the unobstructed toy. In all, the boys in this st udy demonstrated the classic terrible-twos response to a limitation of their freedom: outright defiance. 2 Why should psychological reacta nce emerge at the age of 2? Perhaps the answer has to do with a crucial change that most children go through about this time. It is then that they first come to a recognition of themselv es as individuals. No longer do they view themselves as mere extensions of the social milieu but rather as identifiable, singular, and separate beings (Levine, 1983; Lewis & Brooks-Gunn, 1979; Mahler. Pine, & Bergman, 1975). This developing concept of autonomy brings natu rally with it the concept of freedom. An independent being is one with choices; a child with the newfound realization that he or she is such a being will want to explore the length and breadth of the options. Perhaps we should be neither surprised 2 Two-year-old girls in this study did not show the same resistant response to the large barrier as did the boys. Another study suggest ed this to be the case not because girls don't oppose attempts to limit their freedoms. In stead, it appears that they are primarily reactant to restrictions that come from other persons rather than from physical barriers (S. S. Brehm, 1981).

They have come to a recent and exhilarating perspec tive of themselves: they are freestanding human entities. Vital questions of choice, rights, and contro l now need to be asked and answered within their small minds. The tende ncy to fight for every liberty and against every restriction might be best understood, th en, as a quest for information. By testing severely the limits of their freedoms (and, coincidentally, th e patience of their parents), the children are discovering where in their wo rlds they can expect to be controlled and where to be in control. As we will see late r, it is the wise parent who provides highly consistent information. Adult Reactance: Love, Guns, and Suds Although the terrible twos may be the most noticeable age of psychological reactance, we show the strong tendency to react against re strictions on our freedoms of action throughout our lives. One other age does st and out, however, as a time when this tendency takes an especially rebellious form: the teenage years. An enlightened neighbor once advised me, \"If you really want to get something done, you've got three options: do it yourself, pay top dollar, or forbid your teenagers to do it.\" Like the twos, this period is characterized by an emerging sense of individuality. For teenagers, the emergence is out of the role of child, with all of its atte ndant parental control, and toward the role of adult, with all of its attendant rights and duties. Not surprisingly, adolescents tend to focus less on the duties than on the rights they feel they have as young adults. Not surprisingly, again, imposing tr aditional parental authority at these times is often counterproductive; teenagers will sneak, scheme, and fight to resist such attempts at control. Nothing illustrates the boomerang quality of parental pressure on adolescent behavior quite so clearly as a phenome non known as the \"Romeo and Ju liet effect.\" As we know, Romeo Montague and Juliet Capul et were the ill-fated Shakespearean characters whose love was doomed by a feud between their families. Defying all parental attempts to keep them apart, the teenagers won a lasting union in their tragic act of twin suicide, an ultimate assertion of free will. The intensity of the couple's feelings a nd actions has always been a source of wonderment and puzzlement to observers of the play. How could such inordinate devotion develop so quickly in a pair so young? A romantic might suggest rare and perfect love. A social scientis t, though, might point to the ro le of parental interference and the psychological reactance it can produ ce. Perhaps the passion of Romeo and Juliet was not initially so consuming that it tran scended the extensive ba rriers erected by the families. Perhaps, instead, it was fueled to a white heat by the placement of those barriers. Could it be that had the youngsters been left to their own devices, their inflamed devotion would have amounted to no more than a flicker of puppy love? Because the story is a work of fiction, such questions are, of course, hypothetical and any answer to them speculative. However, it is possible to ask and answer with more certainty similar questions about modern-day Romeos and Juliets.

According to a study done with 140 Colorado teenage couples, that is exactly wh at they do. The researchers in this study found that although parental interference was linked to some problems in the relationship—the partners view ed one another more critica lly and reported a greater number of negative behaviors in the other—that interferen ce also made the pair feel greater love for each other and desire for ma rriage. During the course of the study, as parental interference intensif ied, so did the love experience. When the interference weakened, romantic feelings actually cooled (Drisco ll, Davis, & Lipetz, 1972). 3 READER'S REPORT 7.1 From a Blacksburg, Virginia, Woman Last Christmas I met a 27-year-old man. I was 19. Although he really wasn't my type, I went out with him—probably because it was a status thing to date an older man— but I really didn't become interested in him until my folks expressed their concern about his age. The more they got on my case about it, the more in love I became. It only lasted five months, but this was about four months longer than it would have lasted if my parents hadn't said anything. Author's note: Although Romeo and Juliet have long since passed away, it appears that the Romeo and Juliet effect is alive and well and making re gular appearances in places like Blacksburg, Virginia. For twos and teens, then, psychological r eactance flows across th e broad surface of experience, always turbulent and forceful. For most of the rest of us, the pool of reactant energy lies quiet and covere d, erupting geyserlike only on occasion (Ruback & Juieng, 1997). Still, these eruptions manife st themselves in a variety of 3 The occurrence of the Romeo a nd Juliet effect should not be interpreted as a warning to parents to be always accepting of their teenag ers' romantic choices. New players at this delicate game are likely to err often and, cons equently, would benefit from the direction of an adult with greater pers pective and experience. In prov iding such direction, parents should recognize that teenagers, who see themselves as you ng adults, will not respond well to control attempts that are typical of parent-child relationships. Especially in the clearly adult arena of mating, adult tools of influence (pre ference and persuasion) will be more effective than traditional form s of parental contro l (prohibitions and punishments). Although the experience of th e Montague and Capulet families is an extreme example, heavy-handed restrictions on a young romantic alliance may well turn it clandestine, torrid, and sad. "},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"214 Chapter 7 fascinating ways that are of interest not on ly to the student of human behavior but to lawmakers and policymakers as well Foe instance, there's the odd case of Kennesa w, Georgia, the town that enacted a law requiring every adult resident to own a gun and ammunition, under penalty of six months in jail and a $200 fine. A]l the f eatures of the Kennesaw gun law make it a prime target for psychological reactance. Th e freedom that the law restricts is an important, longstanding one to which most Amer ican citizens f eel entitled. Furthermore, the law was passed by the Kennesaw City C ouncil with a minimum of public input. Reactance theory would predict that under thes e circumstances few of the adults in the town of 5.400 would obey. Yet, the newspaper reports testifie d that three to four weeks after passage of the law, firearms sales in Kennesaw were—no pun intended—booming. How are we to make sense of this apparent contradiction of the re actance principle? The answer is by looking a bit cl oser at those who were buyi ng Kennesaw's guns. Interviews with Kennesaw store owners revealed that the gun buyers were not town residents at all, but visitors, many of them lu red by publicity to purchase thei r initial guns in Kennesaw. Donna Green, proprietor of a shop describe d in one newspaper article as a virtual \"grocery store of firearms,\" summed it up: \"Business is great. But they're almost all being bought up by people from out of town. We've only had two or three local people buy a gun to comply with the law.\" After passage of th e law, then, gun buying had become a frequent activity in Kennesaw, but not among those it was intended to cover; they were massively noncompliant. Only thos e individuals whose fr eedom in the matter had not been restricted by the law had the inclination to live by it. A similar situation arose a decade earlier several hundred miles south of Kennesaw, when, to protect the environment, Dade County (Miami), Florida, imposed an antiphosphate ordinance prohibiting the us e—and possession!—of laundry or cleaning products containing phosphates. A study done to determine the social impact of the law discovered two parallel reactions on the part of Miami residents. First, in what seems a Florida tradition, many Miarnians turned to smuggling. Sometimes with neighbors and friends in large \"soap carava ns,\" they drove to nearby c ounties to load up on phosphate detergents. Hoarding quickly developed and, in the rush of obsession that frequently characterizes hoarders, families boasted of having 20-year supplies of phosphate cleaners. The second reaction to the law was more sub tle and more general than the deliberate defiance of the smugglers and hoarders. Spurred by the tendency to want what they could no longer have, the majority of Miam i consumers came to see phosphate cleaners as better products than before. Compared to Tampa residents, who were not affected by the Dade County ordinance, the citizens of Miami rated phosphate detergents gentler, more effective in cold water, better white ners and fresheners, and more powerful on stains. After passage of the law, they had even come to believe that phosphate detergents poured more easily (Mazis , 1975; Mazis, Settle, & Leslie, 1973). "},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Scarcity 215 This sort of response is typical of individuals who have lost an established freedom; and recognizing that it is typical is crucial to understa nding how psychological reactance and the principle of scarcity work. When something becomes less available our freedom to have it is limited, and we experience an increased desire for it. We rarely recognize, however, that psychological reactance has cau sed us to want the item more; all we know is that we want it. To make sense of our heightened desire for the item, we begin to assign it positive qualities. In the case of the Dade Count y antiphosphate law—and in other instances of newly restricted av ailability— assuming a cause-and-effect relationship between desire and merit is a faulty supposition. Phosphate detergents clean, whiten, and pour no better after they are banned than they do before. We just assume they do because we find that we desire them more. Censorship The tendency to want what has been banned, a nd, therefore, to presume that it is more worthwhile is not limited to commodities su ch as laundry soap; it also extends to restrictions on information. In an age when the ability to acquire, store, and manage information increasingly affects access to wealth and power, it is important to understand how we typically r eact to attempts to censor or otherwise constrain our access to information. Although much data exis t concerning our reactions to observing various kinds of poten tially censorable material—media violence, pornography, radical political rhetoric—there is surprisingly lit tle evidence on our reac tions to the censoring of this material. Fortunately, the results of the few studies that have been done on censorship are highly consistent. Almost inva riably, our response to banned information is to want to receive that information to a greater extent and to become more favorable toward it than we were before the ban. (Ashmore, Ramchandra, & Jones, 1971; Wicklund & Brehm, 1974; Worchel & Arnold, 1973; Worchel, Arnold, & Baker, 1975; Worchel, 1992). The intriguing finding about the effects of censored informa tion on an audience is not that audience members want to have the information more than before; that seems natural. Rather, it is that they come to be lieve in the informati on more, even though they haven't received it. For example, when University of North Carolina students learned that a speech opposing coed dorms on cam pus would be banned, they became more opposed to the idea of coed dorms (Worch el, Arnold, & Baker, 1975). Thus, without ever hearing the speech, the students becam e more sympathetic to its argument. This raises the worrisome possibility that especi ally clever individuals holding a weak or unpopular position on an issue can get us to agree with that position by arranging to have their message restricted. The irony is that for such people—members of fringe political groups, for example—the most effect ive strategy may not be to publicize their unpopular views but to get those views offici ally censored and then to publicize the censorship. Perhaps the authors of this country's Constitution were acting as much as sophisticated social ps ychologists as staunch civil libertarians when "},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"216 Chapter 7 they wrote the remarkably permissive free speech provision of the First Amendment. By refusing to re&train freedom of speech, they may have been trying to minimize the chance that new political notions would win support via the irrational course of psychological reactance. 4 Of course, political ideas are not the only kind that are susceptible to restriction. Access to sexually oriented material is also fre quently limited. Although not as sensational as the occasional police crackdown on \"adult\" booksto res and theaters, regular pressure is applied by parents and citizens groups to cen sor the sexual content of educational material ranging from sex education and hygiene texts to school library books. Both sides in the struggle seem to be well intenti oned and the issues are not simple, as they involve such matters as morality, art, pare ntal control over the schools, and freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment. From a purely psychological point of view, however, those favoring strict censorship may wish to examine closely the results of a study done on Purdue University undergra duates (Zellinger, Fromkin. Speller, & Kohn, 1974). In this study, students were shown some advertisements for a novel. For half the students, the advertising copy included the statement \"a book for adults only, restricted to those 21 years and over\"; the other half of the students read no such age restriction on the book. When the researcher later asked the students to indicate th eir feelings toward the book, they discovered the same pair of reactions we have noted with other bans: Those who learned of the age restriction want ed to read the book mo re and believed that they would like the book more than did those who thought their access to the book was unlimited. It might be argued that, although these resu lts may be true for a small sample of sexually inclined college students, they would not apply to students in junior and senior high schools, where the sex curricula battle s are actually being waged. Two factors make me doubt such an argument. First, developmental psychologists report that the desire to oppose adult control generally begins quite ear ly in adolescence, around the start of the teenage years. Nonscientific observe rs have also noted the early rise of these strong oppositional tendencies. Shakespeare, scholars tell us, placed Romeo and Juliet at the ages of 15 and 13 years, respectivel y. Second, the pattern of reactions exhibited by the Purdue students is not uni que to the topic of sex and t hus can't be attributed to any great preoccupation with sex that college students may have (Bushman & Stack, 1996). In fact, the pattern is common to exte rnally imposed restrictions in general. Limiting access to the book had the same eff ects as did banning phosphate detergents in Florida or censoring a speech in North Ca rolina: The people involved wanted the restricted item more and, as a result, felt more favorable toward it. Those who support the official banning of sexually relevant materials from school curricula have the avowed goal of reduc ing the orientation of the society, es- 4 Evidence that reactance can cause people to take political action they would otherwise not have taken comes from a study by He ilman (1976).

"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Scarcity 217 pecially of its youth, toward eroticism. In the light of the Purdue study and in the context of other research on the effects of imposed restra ints, one must wonder whether official censorship as a means may not be anti thetical to the goal. If we are to believe the implications of the research, then censo rship is likely to increase the desire of students for sexual material and, consequently, to cause them to view themselves as the kind of individuals who like such material. The term official censorship usually makes us think of ba ns on political or sexually explicit material, yet there is another common sort of official censorship that we don't think of in the same way, proba bly because it occurs after the fact. Often in a jury trial, a piece of evidence or testimony will be intr oduced, only to be ruled inadmissible by the presiding judge, who may then admonish the jurors to disr egard that evidence. From this perspective, the judge ma y be viewed as a censor, though the form of the censorship is odd. The presentation of the information to the jury is not banne d—too late for that— it's the jury's use of the information that is banned. How effective are such instructions from a judge? Is it possible that, for jury me mbers who feel it is their right to consider all the available information, declarations of inad-missibility may actually cause psychological reactance, leading the jurors to use the evidence to a greater extent? These were some of the questions asked in a large-scale jury rese arch project conducted by the University of Chicago Law School (B roeder, 1959). One reason the results of the Chicago jury project are informative is that the participants were individuals who were actually on jury duty at the time and who agreed to be members of \"experimental juries\" formed by the researchers. These experimental juries then heard tapes of evidence from previous trials and deliberated as if they were deciding the case. In the study most relevant to our interest in official censorsh ip, 30 such juries heard the case of a woman who was injured by a car driven by a careless male defenda nt. The first finding of the study was no surprise: When the driver said he had liability insurance, the jurors awarded his victim an average of $4,000 more than when he said he had no insurance ($37,000 versus $33,000). Thus, as insurance companies have long suspected, juries make larger awards to vict ims if an insurance company will have to pay. The second finding of the study is the fascinating one, though. If the driver said he was insured and the judge ruled that evidence inadmissible (d irecting the jury to disregard it), the instruction to disregard had a boomerang effect, causing an average award of $46,000. So, when certain juries learned that the driv er was insured, they increased the damage payment by $4,000. When other juries were told officially that they must disregard the information, they used it still more, in creasing the damage payment by $13,000. It appears, then, that even the proper, offici al censorship of a cour troom setting creates problems for the censor. We react to informa tion restriction there, as we do in other areas, by valuing the banned information more than ever (for additional evidence, see Wolf & Montgomery, 1977). The realization that we value limited information allows us to apply the scarcity principle to real ms beyond material commodities. The principle works for messages, communica tions, and knowledge, too. Ta king this perspective, we can see that "},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"218 Chapter 7 information may not have to be censored for MS to value it more; it need only be scarce. According to the scarcity principle, we will find a piece of information more persuasive if we think that we can't ge t it elsewhere. This idea—that exclusive information is mare persuasive inform ation—is central to the thinking of two psychologists, Timothy Brock and Howa rd Fromkin, who have developed a \"commodity theory\" analysis of pers uasion (Brock, 1968; Fromkin & Brock, 1971). The strongest support I know for Brock and Fromkin's theory comes from a small experiment done by a student of mine (Kni shinsky, 1982). At the time, the student was also a successful businessman, the owne r of a beef-importing company, who had returned to school to get advanced training in marketing. After we talked in my office one day about scarcity and exclusivity of in formation, he decided to do a study using his sales staff. The company's customers—buyers for supermarkets and other retail food outlets—were called on the phone as usual by a salesperson a nd asked for a purchase in one of three ways. One set of customers hear d a standard sales presentation before being asked for their orders. Anothe r set of customers heard the standard sales presentation plus information that the supply of importe d beef was likely to be scarce in the upcoming months. A third group received the standard sales presentation and the information about a scarce supply of beef, t oo; however, they also learned that the scarce supply news was not generally available information—it had come, they were told, from certain exclusive contacts that the company had. 5 Thus, the customers who received this last sales presentation learned that not only was the availability of the product limited, so too was the news con cerning it—the scarcity double-whammy. The results of the experiment quickly becam e apparent when the company salespeople began to urge the owner to buy more beef because there wasn't enough in the inventory to keep up with all the orders they were receiving. Compared to the customers who got only the standard sales appeal, t hose who were also to ld about the future scarcity of beef bought more than twice as much. The real boost in sales, however, occurred among the customers who heard of the impending scar city via \"exclusive\" information. They purchased six times the amount that the customers who receiv ed only the standard sales pitch did. Apparently, the fact that the news about the scarcity information was itself scarce made it especially persuasive. OPTIMAL CONDITIONS_______________________________ Much like the other effective weapons of in fluence, the scarcity principle is more effective at some times than at others. An im portant practical defense, then, is to find out when scarcity works best on us. A great deal can be learned from an experiment 5 For ethical reasons, the information provided to the customers was always true. There was an impending foreign beef shortage and this news had, indeed, come to the company through its exclusive sources. "},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Scarcity 219 devised by social psychologi st Stephen Worchel and his colleagues (Worchel, Lee, & Adewole, 1975). The basic procedure used by Worchel and his research team was simple: Participants in a consumer prefer ence study were given a chocolate chip cookie from a jar and asked to taste a nd rate its quality. For half of the raters, the jar contained ten cookies; for the other half, it contained just two. As we might expect from the scarcity principle, when th e cookie was one of only two available, it was rated more favorably than when it was one of ten. The cookie in short supply was rated as more desirable to eat in the future, more attractiv e as a consumer item, and more costly than the identical cookie in abundant supply. Although this pattern of result s provides a rather striking validation of the scarcity principle, it doesn't tell us anything we don't already know. Once again, we see that a less available item is more desired and valu ed. The real worth of the cookie study comes from two additional findings. Let's take them one at a time, as each deserves thorough consideration. New Scarcity: Costlier C ookies and Civil Conflict The first of these noteworthy results involved a small variation in the experiment's basic procedure. Rather than rating the cookies und er conditions of constant scarcity, some participants were first given ajar of ten cooki es that was then repl aced by ajar of two cookies. Thus, before taking a bite, certain of the participants saw their abundant supply of cookies reduced to a scarce supply. Othe r participants, however, knew only scarcity of supply from the onset, as the number of cookie s in their jars was le ft at two. With this procedure, the researchers were seeking to an swer a question about t ypes of scarcity: Do we value more those things that have beco me recently less available to us or those things that have always been scarce? In the cookie experiment, the answer was plain. The drop from abundance to scarcity produced a decidedly more positive reaction to the cookies than did constant scarcity. The idea that newly experienced scarcity is the more powerful kind applies to situations well beyond the bounds of the cookie study. Fo r example, social scientists have determined that such scarcity is a prim ary cause of political turmoil and violence. Perhaps the most prominent proponent of th is argument is James C. Davies (1962, 1969) who states that we are most likely to find revolutions at a time when a period of improving economic and social conditions is followed by a short, sharp reversal in those conditions. Thus, it is not the traditionally most downtrodden people— those who have come to see their deprivation as part of th e natural order of things—who are especially likely to revolt. Instead, revolu tionaries are more likely to be those who have been given at least some taste of a be tter life. When the economic a nd social improvements they have experienced and come to expect suddenl y become less available, they desire them more than ever and often rise up violently to secure them. For instance, it is little recognized that at the time of the Ameri can Revolution, the colonists had the highest standard of living and the lo west taxes in the Western Wo rld. According to historian Thomas Fleming (1997), it wasn't until the "},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"220 Chapter 7 British sought a cut of this widespread prosperity (by levying taxes) that the Americans revolted. Davies has gathered persuasive evidence for his novel thesis from a range of revolutions, revolts, and inte rnal wars, including the Fr ench, Russian, and Egyptian revolutions, as well as such domestic uprisings as Dorr's Rebellion in nineteenth- century Rhode Island, the American Civil Wa r, and the urban black riots of the 1960s. In each case, a time of increasing well-being preceded a tight cluster of reversals that burst into violence. The racial conflict in America's cities dur ing the mid-1960s repres ents a case in point that many of us can recall. At the time, it was not uncommon to hear the question, \"Why now?\" It didn't seem to make sense that w ithin their 300-year history, most of which had been spent in servitude and much of the rest in privation, American blacks would choose the socially progressive sixties as th e time to revolt. Indeed, as Davies points out, the two decades after the start of World War II had br ought dramatic political and economic gains to the black population. In 1940, blacks faced stringent legal restrictions in such areas as housing, transportation a nd education; moreover, even when the amount of education was the same, the average black family earned only a bit more than half the amount its counterpart white fam ily earned. Fifteen years later, much had changed. Federal legislation had struck down as unacceptable formal and informal attempts to segregate blacks in school s, public places, housing, and employment settings. Economic advances had been made, too; black family income had risen from 56 to 80 percent of that of a co mparably educated white family. Then, according to Davies' analysis of social conditions, this rapid progress was stymied by events that soured the hea dy optimism of previous years. First, political and legal change proved substantially easier to en act than social cha nge. Despite all the progressive legislation of the 1940s a nd 1950s, blacks perceived that most neighborhoods, jobs, and schools remained se gregated. Thus, the Washington-based victories came to feel like defeats at home. For example, in the four years following the Supreme Court's 1954 decision to integrate all public schools, blacks were the targets of 530 acts of violence (direct in timidation of black children and parents, bombings and burnings) designed to prevent school integrati on. This violence gene rated the perception of another sort of setback in black progress. For the first time since well before World War II, when lynchings had occurred at an av erage rate of 78 per y ear, blacks had to be concerned about the basic safety of their fa milies. The new violence was not limited to the education issue, either. Peaceful civi l rights demonstrations of the time were frequently confronted by hostile crowds—and police. Still another type of downturn occurred w ithin the black populace in economic progress. In 1962, the income of a black fa mily had slid back to 74 pe rcent of that of a similarly educated white family. By Davies's argument, the most illuminating aspect of this 74 percent figure is not that it represented a long-term increas e in prosperity from prewar levels, but that it represented a short-term decline from the flush levels of the mid- 1950s. In 1963 came the Birmingham riots and, in staccato suc- "},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Scarcity 221 cession, scores of violent demonstrations , building toward th e major upheavals of Watts, Newark, and Detroit. In keeping with a distinct historical pattern of revol ution, blacks in the United States were more rebellious when their pr olonged progress was some what curtailed than they were before it began. This pattern o ffers a valuable lesson for would-be rulers: When it comes to freedoms, it is more dangerous to have given for a while than never to have given at all. The problem for a governme nt that seeks to improve the political and economic status of a traditionally oppressed group is that, in so doing, it establishes freedoms for the group where none ex isted before. Should these now established freedoms become less available, there will be an especially hot variety of hell to pay. We can look to more recent events in the fo rmer Soviet Union for evidence that this basic rule still holds. Afte r decades of repression, Mi khail Gorbachev began granting the Soviet populace new liberties, privileges , and choices via the twin polices of glasnost and perestroika. Alarmed by the direction thei r nation was taking, a small group of government, military, and KGB offi cials staged a coup, placing Gorbachev under house arrest and announcing on August 19, 1991, that they had assumed power and were moving to reinstate the old order. Mo st of the world imagined that the Soviet people, known for their characteristic acquiescence to subjugation, would passively yield as they had always done. Time magazine editor, Lance Morrow, described his own reaction similarly: \"At first the coup s eemed to confirm the norm. The news administered a dark shock, followed immedi ately by a depressed sense of resignation: of course, of course, the Russians must reve rt to their essential selves, to their own history. Gorbachev and glasnost were an aberration; now we are back to fatal normality\" (1991). But these were not to be normal times. Fo r one thing, Gorbachev had not governed in the tradition of the czars or Stalin or any of the line of oppressive post-War rulers who had not allowed even a breath of freedom to the masses. He had ceded them certain rights and choices. And when these now es tablished freedoms were threatened, the people lashed out the way a dog would if so meone tried taking a fresh bone from its mouth. Within hours of the junta's announcement, thousands were in the streets erecting barricades, confronting armed troops, surr ounding tanks, and defying curfews. The uprising was so swift, so massive, so unitary in its opposition to any retreat from the gains of glasnost that after only three riotous days, the astonished officials relented, surrendering their power and pleading for mercy from Chairman Gorbachev. Had they been students of history—or of psychology—the failed plotters would not have been so surprised by the tidal wave of popular resist ance that swallowed their coup. From the vantage point of either discipline, they coul d have learned an invariant lesson: Freedoms once granted will not be relinquished without a fight. The lesson applies to the politics of family as well as country. The parent who grants privileges or enforces rules erratically i nvites rebellion by unw ittingly establishing freedoms for the child. The pa rent who only sometimes prohibits between-meal sweets may create for the child the freedom to have such snacks. At that point,"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"222 Chapter 7 enforcing the rule becomes a much more di fficult and explosive matter because the child is no longer merely lacking a never-pos sessed right but is lo sing an established one. As we have seen in the case of political freedoms and (especially pertinent to the present discussion) chocolate chip cookies, peop le see a thing as more desirable when it recently has become less available than when it has been scarce all along. We should not be surprised, then, that research shows that parent s who enforce and discipline inconsistently produce generally rebelli ous children (Lytton, 1979; O'Leary, 1995). 6 ^o avoid this problem, parents needn't be severe or unduly rigid rulekeepers. For example, a child who unavoidably misses l unch can be given a before-dinner snack because this would not violate the normal ru le against such snacks and, consequently, would not establish a genera l freedom. The difficulty conies when the child is capriciously allowed a treat on some days but not on others and can see no good reason for the difference. It is this arbitrary a pproach that can build perceived freedoms and provoke rebellion. "},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Scarcity 223 READER'S REPORT 7.2 From a New York Investment Manager I recently read a story in the Wall Street Journal that illustrates the scarcity principle and how people want whatever is taken away from them. Th e article described how Procter & Gamble tried an experiment in upstate New York by eliminating all savings coupons for their products and replacing the co upons with lower everyday prices. This produced a big consumer revolt—with boyco tts, and protests, and a firestorm of complaints—even though Procter & Gamble's data showed that only 2 percent of coupons are used and that, on average dur ing the no-coupon experiment, consumers paid the same for P&G products with less in convenience. According to the article, the revolt happened because of something that P&G didn't recognize: \"Coupons, to many people, are practically an inalienable right .\" It is amazing how strongly people react when you try to take things awa y, even if they never use them. Author's note: Although Procter & Gamble executives may have been perplexed by this seemingly irrational consumer response, they inadvertently contribu ted to it. Discount coupons have been part of the American scene for over a century, and P&G had actively \"couponed\" its products for decades, thereby helping to establish coupons as something consumers had a right to expect. A nd it's always the long-established rights that people fight most ferociously to preserve. Competition for Scarce Resources: Foolish Fury Let's look back to the cookie study for another insight into the way we react to scarcity. We've already seen from the results of that study that scarce cook ies were rated higher than abundant cookies and that newly scarce cookies were rated higher still. Staying with the newly scarce cookies now, we find th at certain cookies were the highest rated of all—those that became less available be cause of a demand for them. Remember that in the experiment the participants who experi enced new scarcity had been given a jar of ten cookies that was then replaced with a jar of only two c ookies. Actually, the researchers created this scarcity in one of tw o ways. Certain participants were told that some of their cookies had to be given away to other raters in order to supply the demand for cookies in the study. Another set of partic ipants was told that the number of their cookies had to be reduced because the resear cher had simply made a mistake and given them the wrong jar initially. The results showed that th ose whose cookies became scarce through the process of social demand liked the cookies significantly more than did those whose cookies became scarce by mistake. In fact, the cookies made less available through social demand were rated the most desirable of any in the study. This finding highlights the importance of competition in the pursuit of limited resources. Not only do we want the same item more when it is scar ce, we want it most when we are in competition for it. Advertiser s often try to exploit this tendency in "},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"224 Chapter 7 us. In their ads, we learn that \"popular de mand\" for an item is so great that we must \"hurry to buy\"; we see a crow d pressing against the doors, of a store before the start of a sale; we watch a flock of hands quickly depl ete a supermarket shel f of a product. There is more to such images than the idea of ordi nary social proof. The- message is not just that the product is good because other people think so. but also that we are in direct competition with those people for it. The feeling of being in competition for scarce resources has powerful motivating properties. The ardor of an indifferent lover surges with the appearance of i. rival. It is often for reasons of strategy, therefore, that romantic partners re veal (or invent) the attentions of a new admirer. Salespeople are taught to play the same game with indecisive customers. For example, a realto r who is trying to sell a house to a \"fence- sitting\" prospect sometimes will call the prospect with news of another potential buyer who has seen the house, liked it, and is schedule d to return the fo llowing day to talk about terms. When wholly fabricated, th e new bidder is commonl y described as an outsider with plenty of money: \"an out-of-state investor buy ing for tax purposes\" and \"a physician and his wife moving into town\" ar e favorites. The tactic, called in some circles \"goosing 'em off the fence,\" can work devastatingly well. The thought of losing out to a rival frequently turns a buyer from hesitant to zealous, There is something almost phys ical about the desire to ha ve a contested item. Shoppers at big close-out or bargain sales report being caught up emotionally in the event. Charged by the crush of competitors, they swarm and struggle to claim merchandise they would otherwise disdain. Such beha vior brings to mind the \"feeding frenzy\" phenomenon of wild, indiscriminate ea ting among animal groups. Commercial fishermen exploit the phenomenon by throwing a quantity of loose bait to large schools of certain fish. Soon the water is a roili ng expanse of thrashing fins and snapping mouths competing for the food. At this poin t, the fishermen save time and money by dropping unbated lines into the water, since the crazed fish will bite ferociously at anything, including bare metal hooks. There is a noticeable parallel between the ways that commercial fishermen and department stores generate a competitive fu ry among those they wi sh to hook. To attract and arouse the catch, fishermen scatter some loose bait called chum. For similar purposes, department stores holding a bargai n sale toss out a few especially good deals on prominently advertised items called loss leaders. If the bait—of either form—has done its job, a large and eager crowd forms to snap it up. Soon, in the rush to score, the group becomes agitated, nearly blinded, by th e adversarial nature of the situation. Human beings and fish alike lose perspective on what they want and begin striking at whatever is being contested. One wonders wh ether the tuna flapping on a dry deck with only a bare hook in its mouth shares the wh at-hit-me bewilderment of the shopper arriving home with a load of department store bilge. Lest we believe that the competition-for-lim ited-resources fever occurs only in such unsophisticated forms of life as tuna a nd bargain basement shoppers, we should examine the story behind a remarkable purchase decision made in 1973 by Barry Diller, who was vice president for prime-time programming of the American Broad-"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Scarcity 225 casting Company and who went on to head Pa ramount Pictures and the Fox Televi-sion Network. He agreed to pay $3.3 million for a single television showing of the movie The Poseidon Adventure. The figure is noteworthy in that it greatly exceeded the highest price ever before paid for a one-time movie showing—$2 million for Pat-ton. In fact, the payment was so excessive that ABC figured to lose $1 million on the Poseidon showing. As NBC vice president for special programs, Bill Storke declared at the tune, \"There's no way they can get their money back, no way at all\""},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"226 Chapter 7 How could an astute and experienced businessman like Diller go for a deal that would produce an expected loss of $1 million\"? Th e answer may lie in a second noteworthy aspect of the sale: It was the first time th at a motion picture had been offered to the networks in an open-bid auction. Never before had the three networks been forced to battle for a scarce resource in quite this way. The novel idea of a competitive auction was the brainchild of the movie's flamboya nt showman producer, Irwin Allen, and 20th Century-Fox vice president. William Self, who must have been ecstatic about the outcome. How can we be sure that it was the auction format that generated the spectacular sales price rather than the blockbluster quality of the movie itself? Some comments from the auction participants provide impressive evidence. First came a statement from the victor, Barry Diller, in tended to set future policy for his network. In language sounding like it could have escaped only from between clenched teeth, he said, \"ABC has decided regarding its policy for the future that it would never again enter into an auction situation.\" Even more instructive are the remarks of Diller's rival, Robert Wood, then president of CBS Televisi on, who nearly lost hi s head and outbid his competitors at ABC and NBC: We were very rational at the start. We priced the movie out , in terms of what it could bring in for us, then allowed a certain value on top of that for exploitation. But then the bidding started. ABC opened w ith $2 million. I came back with $2.4. ABC went $2.8. And the fever of th e thing caught us. Like a guy who had lost his mind, I kept bidding. Finally, 1 went to $3.2; and there came a moment when I sa id to myself, \"Good grief, if I get it, what the heck am I going to do with it?\" When ABC finally topped me, my main feeling was relief. It's been very educational. (MacKenzie. 1974, p. 4) According to interviewer Bob MacKenzie, when Wood said, \"It's been very educational,\" he was smiling. We can be su re that when ABC's Diller vowed \"never again,\" he was not. Both men had clea rly learned a lesson from the \"Great Poseidon Auction.\" The reason that both could not smile as a consequence was that, for one, there had been a $ 1 million tuition charge. Fortunately , there is a valuable but drastically less expensive lesson here for us, too. It is inst ructive to note that the smiling man was the one who had lost the highly sought-after prize. As a general rule, when the dust settles and we find losers looking a nd speaking like winners (and vice versa), we should be especially wary of the conditions that ki cked up the dust—in the present case, open competition for a scarce resource. As the TV executives learned, extreme caution is advised whenever we encounter the devilish construction of scarcity plus rivalry. "},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Scarcity 227 "},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"228 Chapter 7 DEFENSE It is easy enough to feel properly warned against scarcity pressures, but it is substantially more difficult to act on that warning. Part of the problem is that our typical reaction to scarcity hinders our ability to think. When we watch as something we want becomes less available, a physic al agitation sets in. Especial ly in those cases involving direct competition, the blood comes up, the focu s narrows, and emotions rise. As this visceral current advances, the c ognitive, rational side retreats. In the rush of arousal, it is difficult to be calm and studied in our appr oach. As CBS-TV president Robert Wood commented in the wake of his Poseidon adventure, \"you get caught up in the mania of the thing, the acceleration of it. Logic goes right out the window\" (MacKenzie, 1974). Here's our predicament, then: Knowing the causes and workings of scarcity pressures may not be sufficient to protect us from them because knowing is a cognitive act, and cognitive processes are suppre ssed by our emotional reaction to scarcity pressures. In fact, this may be the reason for the great effec tiveness of scarcity t actics. When they are employed properly, our first line of defe nse against foolish behavior—a thoughtful analysis of the situation—becomes less likely. If, because of brain-clouding arousal, we can 't rely on our knowledge about the scarcity principle to stimulate properly cautious beha vior, what can we use? Perhaps, in fine jujitsu style, we can use the arousal itself as our prime cue. In this way, we can turn the enemy's strength to our advantage. Rather than relying on a c onsidered, cognitive analysis of the entire situati on, we might well tune ourselves to just the internal, visceral sweep for our warning. By learning to flag the experience of heightening arousal in a compliance situation, we can alert ourselves to the possibility of sc arcity tactics there and to the need for caution. Suppose, however, we accomplish this trick of using the rising tide of arousal as a signal to calm ourselves and to proceed with care. What then? Is there any other piece of information we can use to help make a proper decision in the f ace of scarcity? After all, merely recognizing that we ought to move carefully doesn't tell us the direction in which to move; it only provides the n ecessary context for a thoughtful decision. Fortunately there is information available on which we can base thoughtful decisions about scarce items. It comes, once again, from the chocolate chip cookie study, where the researchers uncovered something that seems strange but ri ngs true regarding scarcity: Even though the scarce cookies were rated as signif icantly more desirable, they were not rated as any better-tasting than the abundant cookies. So, despite the increased yearning that scarcity caused (the raters said they wanted to have more of the scarce cookies in the future and would pay a greater price for them), it did not make the cookies taste one whit better. Therein lies an important insight. The joy is not in the experiencing of a scarce commodity but in th e possessing of it. It is important that we not confuse the two. Whenever we confront the scarcity pressures surrounding some item, we must also confront th e question of what it is we "},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Scarcity 229 want from the item. If the an swer is that we want the th ing for the social, economic, or psychological benefits of possessing somethi ng rare, then, fine; scarcity pressures will give us a good indication of how much we would want to pay for it—the less available it is, the more valuable to us it will be. Ho wever, very often we don't want a thing for the pure sake of owning it. We want it, instead, for its utility value; we want to eat it or drink it or touch it or hear it or drive it or ot herwise use it. In such cases it is vital to remember that scarce things do not taste or feel or sound or ride or work any better because of their limited availability. Although this point is simple it can often escape us when we experience the heightened desirability that scarce items naturally possess. I can cite a family example. My brother Richard supported himself th rough school by employing a co mpliance trick that cashed in handsomely on the tendency of most people to miss that simple point. In fact, his tactic was so effective in this regard that he had to work only a few hours each weekend for his money, leaving the rest of the time free for his studies. Richard sold cars, but not in a showroom or on a car lot. He woul d buy a couple of used cars sold privately through the newspaper on one weekend, and addi ng nothing but soap and water, would sell them at a decided pr ofit through the newspaper on the following weekend. To do this, he had to know three things. First, he had to know enough about cars to buy those that were offered for sale at the bottom of their blue book price range but that could be legitimately resold for a hi gher price. Second, once he got the car, he had to know how to write a newspaper ad that would s timulate substantial buyer interest. Third, once a buyer arrived, he had to know how to use the s carcity principle to generate more desire for the car than it pe rhaps deserved. Richard knew how to do all three. For our purposes, though, we need to examine his craft with just the third. For a car he had purchased on the prior week end, he would place an ad in the Sunday paper. Because he knew how to write a good ad, he usually re ceived an array of calls from potential buyers on Sunday morning. Each prospect who was in terested enough to want to see the car was gi ven an appointment time— the same appointment time. So, if six people were scheduled, they were all scheduled for, say, 2:00 that afternoon. This little device of simultaneous scheduling paved the way for later compliance because it created an atmosphere of competition for a limited resource. Typically, the first prospect to arrive would begin a studie d examination of the car and would engage in standard car-buying behavi or, such as pointing out any blemishes or deficiencies and asking if the price were negotiable. The psychology of the situation changed radically, however, when the second bu yer drove up. The avai lability of the car to either prospect suddenly became limited by the presence of the other. Often the earlier arrival, inadvertently stoking the se nse of rivalry, would assert his right to primary consideration. \"Just a minute now, I was he re first.\" If he didn't assert that right, Richard would do it for him. Addressing the second buyer, he would say, \"Excuse me, but this other gentleman was here before you. So, can I ask you to wait "},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"230 Chapter 7 on the other side of the driveway for a few minut es until he's finished looking at the car? Then, if he decides he doesn't want it or if he can't make up his mind, I'll show it to you.\" Richard claims it was possible to watch the agitation grow on the first buyer's face. His leisurely assessment of the car's pros and cons had suddenly become a now-or-never, limited-time-only rush to a decision over a cont ested resource. If he didn't decide for the car—at Richard's asking price—in the next few minutes, he might lose it for good to that... that. .. lurking newcomer over there. The second buyer would be equally agitated by the combination of rivalr y and restricted availabil ity. He would pace about the periphery of things, visibly straining to get at this s uddenly more desirable hunk of metal. Should 2:00 appointment number one fail to buy or even fail to decide quickly enough, 2:00 appointment number two was ready to pounce. If these conditions alone were not enough to secure a favorable purchase decision immediately, the trap snapped securely shut as soon as the third 2:00 appointment arrived on the scene. According to Richard, stacked-up competition was usually too much for the first prospect to bear. He would end the pressure quickly by either agreeing to Richard's price or by leaving abruptly. In the latter instance, the second arrival would strike at the chance to buy out of a sense of relief coupled with a new feeling of rivalry with that... th at... lurking newcomer over there. All those buyers who co ntributed to my brother's colleg e education failed to recognize a fundamental fact about their purchases: The in creased desire that spurred them to buy had little to do with the merits of the car . The failure of recognition occurred for two reasons. First, the situation that Richard arranged for them produced an emotional reaction that made it difficult for them to th ink straight. Second, as a consequence, they never stopped to think that the reason they wanted the car in the first place was to use it, not merely to have it. The competition-for-a-scarce-resource pressures Richard applied affected only their desire to have the car in the sense of possessi ng it. Those pressures did not affect the value of the car in terms of the real pur pose for which they had wanted it. Should we find ourselves beset by scarcity pr essures in a complianc e situation, then, our best response would occur in a two-stage sequence. As soon as we feel the tide of emotional arousal that flows from scarcity in fluences, we should use that rise in arousal as a signal to stop short. Panicky, feverish reactions have no place in wise compliance decisions. We need to calm our selves and regain a rational perspective. Once that is done, we can move to the second stage by aski ng ourselves why we want the item under consideration. If the answer is that we wa nt it primarily for the purpose of owning it, then we should use its availability to help gauge how much we w ould want to spend for it. However, if the answer is that we want it primarily for its function (that is, we want something good to drive or drink or eat), th en we must remember that the item under consideration will function equally well whethe r scarce or plentiful. Quite simply, we need to recall that the scarce cookies didn't taste any better. "},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Scarcity 231 SUMMARY • According to the scarcity principle, pe ople assign more value to opportunities when they are less available. The use of this principle for profit can be seen in such compliance techniques as the \"limited nu mber\" and \"deadline\" tactics, wherein practitioners try to convince us that access to what they are offering is restricted by amount or time. • The scarcity principle holds for two reasons. First, because things that are difficult to attain are typically more valuable, the availabi lity of an item or experience can serve as a shortcut cue to its quality. Second, as things become less accessible, we lose freedoms. According to psychological reac tance theory, we respond to the loss of freedoms by wanting to have them (along with the goods and serv ices connected to them) more than before. • As a motivator, psychological reactance is present throughout the gr eat majority of the life span. However, it is especially evident at a pair of ages: the terrible twos and the teenage years. Both of these times are characterized by an emerging sense of individuality, which brings to prominence su ch issues as control, rights, and freedom. Consequently, individuals at these ages are especially sensitive to restrictions. • In addition to its effect on the valuati on of commodities, the scarcity principle also applies to the way that information is eval uated. Research indica tes that the act of limiting access to a message causes individuals to want to receive it more and to become more favorable to it. The latter of these findings—that limited information is more persuasive—seems the more surprising. In the case of censorship, this effect occurs even when the message has not been received. When a message has been received, it is more effective if it is perc eived as consisting of exclusive information. • The scarcity principle is most likely to hold true under two optimizing conditions. First, scarce items are heightened in value wh en they are newly scarce. That is, we value those things that have become recently restrict ed more than those that were restricted all along. Second, we are most attrac ted to scarce resources when we compete with others for them. • It is difficult to steel ourselves cognitively against scarcity pressures because they have an emotion-arousing quality that makes thinking difficult. In defense, we might try to be alert to a rush of arousal in situations involving s carcity. Once alerted, we can take steps to calm the arousal and assess the merits of th e opportunity in terms of why we want it. STUDY QUESTIONS Content Mastery 1.

The program was made distinctive by Pine's caustic and confrontational style with his guests—f or the most part, a collection of exposure- hungry entertainers, would-be ce lebrities, and representative s of fringe political or social organizations. The host's abrasive ap proach was designed to provoke his guests into arguments, to fluster them into emba rrassing admissions, and generally to make them look foolish. It was not uncommon for Pine to introduce a visitor and launch immediately into an attack on the individu al's beliefs, talent, or appearance. Some people claimed that Pine's acid personal styl e was partially caused by a leg amputation that had embittered him to life; others sai d, no, that he was just vituperative by nature. One evening rock musician Frank Zappa was a guest on the show. This was at a time in the 1960s when very long hair on men was still unusual and controversial. As soon as Zappa had been introduced and seated, the following exchange occurred: Pine: I guess your long hair makes you a girl. Zappa: I guess your wooden leg makes you a table. PRIMITIVE AUTOMATICITY Aside from containing what may be my favor ite ad-lib, the dialogu e between Pine and Zappa illustrates a fundamental theme of this book: Very often when we make a decision about someone or something we do n't use all of the relevant available information. We use, instead, only a single, highly representative piece of the total. An isolated piece of information, even though it no rmally counsels us correctly, can lead us to clearly stupid mistakes—mistakes that, wh en exploited by clever others, leave us looking silly or worse. At the same time, a complicating compani on theme has been present throughout this book: Despite the susceptibility to stupid de cisions that accompanies a reliance on a single feature of the available data, the pace of modern life demands that we frequently use this shortcut. Recall that early in Chapter 1, we compared this shortcut to the automatic responding of lower animals, whos e elaborate behavior patterns could be triggered by the presence of a lone stim ulus feature—a cheep-cheep sound, a shade of red breast feather, or a specific sequence of light flashes. The reason these lower animals must often rely on such solitary stimul us features of their environments is their restricted mental capacity. Their small brains cannot begin to "},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Instant Influence 235 register and process all of the relevant information in their environments. So these species have evolved special sensitivities to certain aspects of the information. Because those selected aspects of information are normally enough to cue a correct response, the system is usually very efficient: Whenev er a mother turkey hears cheep, cheep, click, whirr, out rolls the proper maternal behavior in a mechanical fashion that conserves much of her limited brainpower for dealing w ith the other situati ons and choices she must face in her day. We, of course, have vastly mo re effective brain mechanisms than do mother turkeys, or any other animal group, for that matter. We ar e unchallenged in the ability to take into account a multitude of relevant facts and, c onsequently, to make good decisions. Indeed, it is this information-processing advantage ove r other species that has helped make us the dominant form of life on the planet. Still, we have our capacity limitations, too; and, for the sake of efficiency, we must sometimes retreat from the time-consuming, sophisticated, fully informed brand of decision making to a more automatic, primitive, single-feature type of responding. For instance, in deciding whether to say yes or no to a requester, we frequently pay attention to a single piece of the relevant information in the situation. In preceding chapters, we have explored several of the most popular of the single pieces of information that we use to prompt our compliance decisions. Th ey are the most popular prompts precisely because they are the most reliable ones, those that normally point us toward the correct choice. That is why we employ the factors of reciprocation, consiste ncy, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity so often and so automatica lly in making our compliance decisions. Each, by itself, provides a highly relia ble cue as to when we will be better off saying yes instead of no. We are likely to use these lone cues when we don't have th e inclination, time, energy, or cognitive resources to undertake a complete analysis of the situ ation. When we are rushed, stressed, uncertain, indifferent, distra cted, or fatigued, we tend to focus on less of the information available to us. When making decisions under these circumstances, we often revert to the rather primitive but necessary single-piece-of-good-evidence approach. 1 All this leads to an unnerving insight: With th e sophisticated mental apparatus we have used to build world em inence as a species, we have created an environment so complex, fast-paced, and info rmation-laden that we must increasingly deal with it in the fashion of th e animals we long ago transcended. Sometimes the consequences can be calam itous. Remember the FBI's infamously misguided assault on Branch Davidian Church headquarters in Wac o, Texas?

MODERN AUTOMATICITY John Stuart Mill, the British economist, politic al thinker, and philosopher of science, died over 125 years ago. The year of his death (1873) is important because he is reputed to have been the last man to know everyt hing there was to know in the world. Today, the notion that one of us could be aware of all known facts is laugha ble. After eons of slow accumulation, human knowledge has snow balled into an era of momentum-fed, multiplicative, monstrous expansion. We now live in a world where most of the information is less than 15 y ears old. In certain fields of science alone (physics, for example), knowledge is said to double every eight years. The scientific information explosion is not limited to such arcane arenas as molecular chemistry or quantum physics, but extends to everyday areas of know ledge where we strive to keep ourselves current—health, child development, nutrition. What's more, this rapid growth is likely to continue, since researchers are pumping their newest findings into an estimated 400,000 scientific journals worldwide. Apart from the streaking advan ce of science, things are quic kly changing much closer to home. According to yearly Ga llup polls, the issues rated as most important on the public agenda are becoming more diverse and are su rviving on that agenda for a shorter time (McCombs & Zhu, 1995). In addition, we travel more and faster; we relocate more frequently to new residences, which are bui lt and torn down more quickly; we contact more people and have shorter relationships with them; in the supermarket, car showroom, and shopping mall, we are faced wi th an array of choices among styles and products that were unheard-of last year and may well be obs olete or forgotten by next year. Novelty, transience, diversity, a nd acceleration are acknowledged as prime descriptors of civilized existence. This avalanche of information and c hoices is made possible by burgeoning technological progress. Leadi ng the way are developments in our ability to collect, store, retrieve, and communicate information. At first, the fruits of such advances were limited to large organizations—government ag encies or powerful corporations. With further developments in telecommunicati ons and computer technology, access to such staggering amounts of information is falling within the reach of individual citizens.

In 1972, Norman Macrae, an editor of the The Economist, speculated prophetically about a time in the future: The prospect is, after all, t hat we are going to enter an age when any duffer sitting at a computer terminal in his laboratory or of fice or public library or home can delve through unimaginable increased mountains of information in mass- assembly data banks with mechanical powers of concentration and calculation that will be greater by a factor of tens of thousands than was ever available to the human brain of even an Einstein. (Macrae, 1972) Just one decade later, Time magazine signaled that Macrae's future age had arrived by naming a machine, the personal com puter, as its Man of the Year. Time's editors defended their choice by citing the consumer \"stampede\" to purchase small computers and by arguing that \"America [and], in a larger perspective, the entire world will never be the same.\" Macrae's vision is presently be ing realized. Millions of ordinary \"duffers\" are sitting in front of computers with the pot ential to present and analyze enough data to bury an Einstein. Modern day visionaries—like Bill Gates, ch airman of Microsoft—agree with Macrae, asserting that we are creating an array of devices capable of delivering a universe of information \"to anyone, anywhere, anytime\" (Davidson, 1999). But notice something telling: Our modern era, of ten termed The Information Age, has never been called The Knowledge Age. Information does not translate directly into knowledge . It must first be processed—accessed, absorbed, comprehended, integrated, and retained. "},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"238 Chapter 8 SHORTCUTS SHALL BE SACRED Because technology can evolve much faster th an we can, our natural capacity to process information is likely to be increasingly inad equate to handle the abundance of change, choice, and the challenge that is characteristic of modern life. More and more frequently, we will find ourselves in the position of lower animals—with a mental apparatus that is unequipped to deal thorough ly with the intricacy and richness of the outside environment. Unlike the lower animals, whose cognitive powers have always teen relatively deficient, we have created our own deficiency by constructing a radically more complex world. The consequence of our ne w deficiency is the same as that of the animals' long-standing one: when making a deci sion, we will less frequently engage in a fully considered analysis of the total situ ation. In response to this \"paralysis of analysis,\" we will revert increasingly to a fo cus on a single, usually reliable feature of the situation. When those single features are truly reliable, there is nothin g inherently wrong with the- shortcut approach of narrowed attention a nd automatic responding to a particular piece of information. The problem comes when something causes the normally trustworthy cues to counsel us poorly, to lead us to erroneous actions and wrongheaded decisions. As we have seen, one such cau se is the trickery of certain compliance practitioners, who seek to profit from the mindless and mechani cal nature of shortcut responding. If, as it seems, the frequency of shortcut responding is increasing with the pace and form of modern life, we can be sure that the frequency of this trickery is destined to increase as well. What can we do about the expected intensifie d attack on our system of shortcuts? More than evasive action, I urge fo rceful counterassault; howev er, there is an important qualification. Compliance professionals who play fairly by the rules of shortcut responding are not to be considered the enemy; to the contrary, they are our allies in an efficient and adaptive process of exchange. The proper targets for counter-aggression are only those individuals who falsify, counter feit, or misrepresent the evidence that naturally cues our shortcut responses. Let's take an illustration from what is perhaps our most frequently used shortcut. According to the principle of social proof, we often decide to do what other people like us are doing. It makes all kinds of sense since, most of the time, an action that is popular in a given situation is also functional and appropriate. Thus, an advertiser who, without using deceptive statistics, provides informati on that a brand of toothpaste is the largest selling has offered us valuable evidence about the quality of the product and the probability that we will like it. Provided that we are in the market for a tube of good toothpaste, we might want to rely on that single piece of information, popularity, to decide to try it. This strategy will likely stee r us right, will unlikely steer us far wrong, and will conserve our cognitive energies for dealing with the rest of our increasingly information-laden, decision-overloaded environm ent. The advertiser who allows us to use effectively this efficient strategy is hardly our antagoni st but rather our cooperating partner. "},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Instant Influence 239 The story becomes quite different, however, when a compliance practitioner tries to stimulate a shortcut response by giving us a fraudulent signal for it. The enemy is an advertiser who seeks to create an image of popularity for a brand of toothpaste by, say, constructing a series of staged \"unrehearsed interview\" commercials in which an array of actors posing as ordinary citizens praises the product. He re, where the evidence of popularity is counterfeit, we, the principle of social proof, and our shortcut response to it, are all being exploited. In an earlier chapter, I recomm ended against the purchase of any product featured in a faked \"unrehearsed in terview\" ad and urged that we send the product manufacturers letters de tailing the reason and sugges ting that they dismiss their advertising agency. I also recommended ex tending this aggressive stance to any situation in which a compliance professional a buses the principle of social proof (or any other weapon of influence) in this manner. We should refuse to watch TV programs that use canned laughter. If we see a bartender begi n a shift by salting the tip jar with a bill or two, that bartender should get no tip from us. If, after waiting in line outside a nightclub, we discover from the amount of available space th at the wait wa s designed to impress passersby with false evidence of the club's popularity, we should leave immediately and announce our reason to those still in line. In short, we should be willing to use boycott, threat, c onfrontation, censure, tirade, nearly anything, to retaliate. I don't consider myself pugnaci ous by nature, but I actively advocate such belligerent actions because in a way I am at war with the exploiters. We all are. It is important to recognize, however, that their motive for prof it is not the cause for hostilities; that motive, after all, is something we each shar e to an extent. The re al treachery, and what we cannot tolerate, is any attempt to make their profit in a wa y that threatens the reliability of our shortcuts. The blitz of m odern daily life demands that we have faithful shortcuts, sound rules of thumb in order to handle it all. These are no longer luxuries; they are out-and-out necessities that figure to become increasingly vital as the pulse quickens. That is why we should want to re taliate whenever we see someone betraying one of our rules of thumb for profit. We want th at rule to be as effective as possible. To the degree that its fitness for duty is regularly undercut by the tricks of a profiteer, we naturally will use it less and w ill be less able to cope effi ciently with the decisional burdens of our day. That we cannot allow w ithout a fight. The stak es are far too high. SUMMARY • Modern life is different from any earlier time. Because of remarkable technological advances, information is burgeoning, choices and alternatives ar e expanding, knowledge is exploding. In this avalanche of change and choice, we have had to adjust. One fundamental adjustment has come in the wa y we make decisions. Although we all wish to make the most thoughtful, fully consider ed decision possible in any situation, the changing form and accelerating pace of "},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"240 Chapter 8 modern life frequently deprive us of the prope r conditions for such a careful analysis of all the relevant pros and cons. More and mo re, we are forced to resort to another decision-making approach—a shor tcut approach in which the decision to comply (or agree or believe or buy) is made on the ba sis of a single, usua lly reliable piece of information. The most reliable and, therefor e, most popular such single triggers for compliance are those described throughou t this book. They are commitments, opportunities for reciprocation, the compliant be havior of similar others, feelings of liking or friendship, authority dire ctives, and scarcity information. • Because of the increasing tendency for cognitive overload in our society, the prevalence of shortcut decision maki ng is likely to increase proportionately. Compliance professionals who infu se their requests with one or another of the triggers of influence are more likely to be successful. The use of these triggers by practitioners is not necessarily exploitative. It only becomes so when the trigger is not a natural feature of the situation but is fabricated by the prac titioner. In order to retain the beneficial character of shortcut response, it is impor tant to oppose such fabrication by all appropriate means. STUDY QUESTIONS Critical Thinking 1. Pick any three of the weapons of influe nce described in this book. Discuss in each case how the weapon coul d be used to enhance complian ce in what you would consider an exploitative manner and in what you w ould consider a nonexploitative manner. 2. For each of the three weapons of influe nce you choose, describe the way you would defend yourself should the weapon be used against you in an e xploitative fashion. 3. Describe the three most important lessons that you have learne d about the influence process from this book. "},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"References Aaker, D. A. (1991). Managing brand equity.
