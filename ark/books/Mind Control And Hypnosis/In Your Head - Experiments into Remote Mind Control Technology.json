[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Temp IN YOUR HEAD: EXPERIMENTS INTO REMOTE MIND CONTROL TECHNOLOGY by Jim Keith An excerpt from his book Mind Control - World Control. Experiments into Remote Mind Control methods has been well researched since the 50's The Soviets reportedly began to delve into the biological effect of microwaves as early as 1953. A number of laboratories were set up across the Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe, including one at the Institute of Hygiene and Occupational Diseases Academy of Medical Sciences. Although the Soviets reported on their experiments in the open literature, the parameteres they defined were insufficient for duplicating the experiments, and some scientists in the United States questioned whether the whole matter was disinformation. It was not. http://www.mindcontrolforums.com/pro-freedom.co.uk/in_your_head.html (1 of 9) [9/15/2004 1:50:51 AM]"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Temp Early CIA funding provided the wherewithal for a project launched at Honeywell, Inc. for \"a method to penetrate inside a man's mind and control his brain waves over long distance.\" At the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Maitland Baldwin, under CIA supervision, bombarded the brains of lobotomised monkeys with radio waves. According to researcher Alex Constantine, \"His CIA monitors noted weird excesses: in one experiment, Baldwin decapitated a monkey and transplanted its head to the body of another, then attempted to restore it to life with radar saturation.\" In 1964, CIA Director Richard Helms sent a memo to the Warren Commission, mentioning \"biological radio communication.\" Helms' theorising about such methods was truly reminiscent of Orwell's 1984. He said, \"Cybernetics [or computer theory] can be used in the moulding of a child's character, the inculcation of knowledge and techniques, the amassing of experience, the establishment of social behaviour patterns... all functions which can be summarised as control of the growth processes of the individual.\" In 1977 Dr. Sam Koslov, the scientific assistant to the Secretary of the Navy, was briefed on a number of current research projects. One of them, in progress at Stanford Research Institute was named \"ELF and Mind Control.\" ELF is the acronym of extremely low frequency electromagnetic radiation. Koslov didn't like the sound of that project and ordered it cancelled, but according to the Washington Post, the funding was merely diverted into a different project heading and continued to go forward. The following report, although anonymous, provides a detailed first person encounter with what may be government electromagnetic testing. It was published in an underground magazine a few years ago. I do not maintain that reports such as these are absolute proof of government electromagnetic testing on citizenry, but well-reasoned accounts such as the following must be taken into consideration: \"The large black top of the Federal Building in San Francisco looks like a giant air-conditioning vent, 50 feet tall, comprising the entire top of the building. It is actually a radar, microwave, and radio transparent shield for an array of communications devices on the roof of the building. Such \"blinds\" on top of government buildings are nothing unusual, it isn't necessary to visually remind everybody that such buildings also are likenesses of Orwell's Ministry of Information (read, CIA). And as such are in need of systems of communications independent of civilian mediums. Which, anyway, would be purposely interrupted in any serious case of civil unrest. \"It is important to note three facts at this point, the purpose of which will come clear in the end: First, the Federal building is located at the base of a broad hill. It is on the low rise of this hill where San Francisco's 'Skid Row' district, the 'Tenderloin,' uneasily rests. And so the Federal Building can be seen from virtually any place in the Tenderloin. And let us reverse this thought: virtually any place in the Tenderloin may be seen from the Federal Building. And it is this unimpeded view which brings to mind the second oddly coinciding factor; that Low Frequency Electromagnetic emissions like television broadcasts will not pass through earth (hills, or the horizon), nor do they even pass very well through buildings, and so require a fairly clear shot, unlike higher frequency emissions like radio. This is why you have to put TV antennas on the roof. http://www.mindcontrolforums.com/pro-freedom.co.uk/in_your_head.html (2 of 9) [9/15/2004 1:50:51 AM]"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Temp \"Now fact three: Extremely Low Frequency transmissions, or ELFs, have been the focus of significant research by the military intelligence machines of several governments, including our own. ELF developments for military purposes is based on indications that ELFs at close range seem to cause aberrations in the thought processes of human beings, such as hallucinations, disordered thought, confusion, aggression, depression anger, hopelessness. Not unlike television, a close companion to ELFs in the electromagnetic spectrum. It is not difficult to imagine the value of such a weapon to our secret government, so fond of the disruption of societies, the control and subjugation of individuals, and of war, 'the insane death dance of paranoid societies.' \"Now with these three things in mind, consider this fourth. Since I have had the fortune to live for three years in this ring of hell, the Tenderloin, I have noticed something very odd. At least 15 times I have noticed in the morning or early evening a pronounced buzzing or humming. Very low and hard to hear. Something like the sound which some can hear of a TV that is on in a room, but with the volume off. And on looking for the source of this sound, I found that it seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. In other words it seemed to be coming from inside my head. I do not mean this figuratively. I mean that my head seemed to resonate with the vibration. And I felt that my thoughts were disrupted. The buzzing seemed to make thoughts fall apart just before forming, like sand on a vibrating metal plate, and I felt vaguely angry. On the third or fourth occurrence of this, I noticed that in the wake of the buzzing sound, an unusual number of fights could be heard breaking out all around me. From out on the streets, and from adjoining buildings, and apartments, came the shouts and threats of people overcome with anger. And I thought, though at first it seemed horrible to consider, 'Hadn't ELF subjects reported the feeling or sound of buzzing in their heads?' and 'what better section of the population could be chosen on which to conduct ELF experiments.' A large percentage of inner urban dwellers are already so close to the edge that he or she is highly likely to express any fluctuation of mood with a corresponding fluctuation of activity which might come to the attention of the police. In a neighbourhood where aberrant behaviour is common and expected, slight increases of such behaviour would go completely unnoticed, but would be detectable by careful observation of incoming reports to the police department. It would be unlikely in the extreme that anyone would associate the strange buzzing sound with unaccountable accompanying emotional swings. Impossible that someone would suspect secret agents of systematically barraging the politically powerless with mood and consciousness ELF waves from atop the Federal Building. But even if such an impossibility came to pass, and allegations were made, would they not automatically be discredited by the general perception of the poor (i.e. Tenderloin inhabitants) as mentally unstable, alcoholic, drug addicted, and of the government as an essentially well meaning parent, who would not really ever purposely harm her children? \"Tests of ELF effects could be precisely monitored by the existing police department recording system (at no extra cost), all recorded on the justice system's networked national computer system, containing exact times of complaints, record of outcome, location, identity, profile, and criminal history of all persons involved. Police department ignorance of the tests would actually be desirable. The entire operation could be run by as few as two people. ELF broadcast times would simply be correlated with any flux of reports to the police department. And the exact nature of the ELF effects on human emotion would be http://www.mindcontrolforums.com/pro-freedom.co.uk/in_your_head.html (3 of 9) [9/15/2004 1:50:51 AM]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Temp conveniently built into the data received from police reports. For example, an increase of domestic violence at 4%, and suicides 2%, perhaps one or two extra stabbings during your special hour-long broadcast of the latest ELF 'Top Ten'. A decrease in premeditated crimes might indicate a breakdown of thought process during the time of ELF transmission. Do you see? A double blind experiment (neither police nor populace have any idea) on a perfectly contained and monitored large population control subjects, in a typical city, with an 'in place' monitoring system (police reports) with a plus or minus accuracy allowance of virtually 0% since the experiment can be performed an unlimited number of times over a period of years. Could such malignant experiments be pulled off in any other setting? If your aim were to induce murders, violence, psychosis, severe depression, or suicide, you couldn't really go calling on John Hopkins University now, could you? Anyway, the very point of such a thing would be its use on urban populations. Listen, you have a little country somewhere, you destabilise the populace with ELFs and conventional means and overwhelm the local law enforcement agencies, martial law is declared, the democratically elected government falls. You install a corrupt dictator. You say to the American people, 'We must send humanitarian aid.' A hundred million dollars is allocated to the small country. The corrupt dictator steals the goods and money, and deposits the laundered free and clear taxpayer dollars in an offshore American bank. Beginning to get the picture? Think of how perfectly foolproof this is, how elegant, how appealing, how logical, how insidious, how horrible, how possible, and all it costs is the suffering of thousands of people. \"Postscript; last week the buzzing happened again, so loud yet so easily dismissed against the background of city noise. How could I prove to myself that it was not simply just coming from my head, could I possibly have the rare hearing condition, tinnitus, which causes ringing in the ears? I remembered a Mr. Science experiment where the electromagnetic transparency of various substances was being demonstrated. A portable radio was placed into a wooden box. 'Hear that? The radio is still playing, which means? That's right, wood is electromagnetically transparent.' The radio was imprisoned in various other containers to see what would happen. Then finally it was wrapped in aluminium foil, and fell silent. I ran into the kitchen and grabbed the tin foil. Pulling a three foot strip of it, I wrapped it around my head, and the buzzing stopped.\" One of the strangest - and most ominous - episodes in the history of electromagnetic irradiation research is the construction of the network of Ground Wave Emergency Network (GWEN) towers, in the 1980s. The GWEN towers are almost 300 feet tall, and a 330-foot web of copper wiring extends out from them, broadcasting bursts of very low frequency (VLF) messages at 20 minute intervals or, from another source, hour intervals. These towers are spaced 200 miles apart from each other and describe a straight line across America. At this time there are 54 operational towers, although at least 29 more are scheduled to be constructed. It is claimed that GWEN is part of the COG (Continuity of Government) program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, designed to keep government functional in the case of disaster, including nuclear war. Some sources disagree that this is the purpose of the project, citing the statement of Colonel Paul Hanson, GWEN Program Director for the Air Force. Hanson has said, \"The towers will http://www.mindcontrolforums.com/pro-freedom.co.uk/in_your_head.html (4 of 9) [9/15/2004 1:50:51 AM]"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Temp not help wage a nuclear war because they would be destroyed in any protracted confrontation.\" Others note that since the GWEN hardware is transistor based, they are particularly vulnerable to the electromagnetic pulses of nuclear explosions. The location of the GWEN towers is also a matter of public record, meaning that they could easily be targeted in case of war or even terrorist threat. Robert O. Becker, M.D., in Crosscurrents: The Perils of Electropollution, says of GWEN: \"GWEN is a superb system, in combination with cyclotron resonance, for producing behavioural alterations in the civilian population. The average strength of the steady geomagnetic field varies from place to place across the United States. Therefore, if one wished to resonate a specific ion in living things in a specific locality, one would require a specific frequency for that location. The spacing of GWEN transmitters 200 miles apart across the United States would allow such specific frequencies to be 'tailored' to the geomagnetic-field strength in each GWEN area.\" A similar system is SECOM II, composed of five broadcasting towers in Idaho, New Mexico, Missouri, South Carolina, and Maryland. These towers were ostensibly constructed as communication links between a central monitoring station and vehicles carrying nuclear weapons and nuclear materials. SECOM II broadcasts in the 3-12 MHz range, which, coincidentally or not, precisely blankets the resonant frequency of the human organism. Another group of towers is mentioned in an anonymous paper titled \"Mind Control Operations/Aquarius Group Activities,\" that states, \"With a general ignorance through arrogance of most public population in the U.S. erection of large cellular towers being carried out under HIGH TONE and ZENO are largely going completely unnoticed. These projects are being carried out in private business capacities and therefore in Deep Black Operations cover. However, public populations would be wise to educate themselves in the construction of these seemingly innocent towers in large population areas. The cellular 800 MHZ waves are a constant wave. Due to the great proliferation of towers in key population areas, they will have a devastating effect.\" An oft-heard allegation is that the CIA has developed a mind control technology they refer to as RHIC- EDOM. The acronym stands for \"Radio Hypnotic Intracerebra Control-Electronic Dissolution of Memory,\" and refers to the ability to induce a hypnotic state from remote locations, impart hypnotic commands, and erase the memory of the programming and the period of time that it took place in. This technology allegedly includes electromagnetic broadcasting as well as intramuscular implants. The erasure of memory is reportedly accomplished by the electromagnetic stimulation of the chemical acetylcholine in the brain. The first mention of RHIC-EDOM was in the 1969 book Were We Controlled? By the pseudonymous Lincoln Lawrence. Lawrence describes RHIS-EDOM in this manner: \"It is the ultra-sophisticated application of post-hypnotic suggestion triggered at will by radio transmission. It is a recurring hypnotic state, reinduced automatically at intervals by the same radio control. An individual is brought under hypnosis. This can be done either with his knowledge - or without it by use of narco-hypnosis, which can be brought into play under many guises. He is then programmed to http://www.mindcontrolforums.com/pro-freedom.co.uk/in_your_head.html (5 of 9) [9/15/2004 1:50:51 AM]"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Temp perform certain actions and maintain certain attitudes upon radio signal.\" Lawrence claimed that Lee Harvey Oswald had been manipulated through RHIC-EDOM, but not by the Russians or the CIA or its brethren. According to Lawrence, Oswald's controllers had been a worldwide cabal of commodities merchants who, through the assassination of the president, wanted to drive stock down and make a fortune. The idea is not entirely implausible. The only other mention of RHIC-EDOM claiming insider knowledge of the technology is an article by James L. Moore, in a 1975 issue of Modern People magazine. In that article, Moore claimed that he possessed a 350-page manual originating from CIA sources on RHIC-EDOM. The manual had supposedly been prepared by the CIA shortly after the murder of John F. Kennedy. Verifying RHIC-EDOM are the researchers of the late L.L. Vasiliev, professor of physiology at the University of Leningrad, who described one experiment in remote hypnosis using undefined techniques of radio control: \"As a control of the subject's condition, when she was outside the laboratory in another set of experiments, a radio set was used. The results obtained indicate that the method of using radio signals substantially enhances the experimental possibilities. I.F. Tomaschevsky [a Russian physiologist] carried out the first experiments with this subject at a distance of one or two rooms, and under conditions that the participant would not know or suspect that she would be experimented with. In other cases, the sender was not in the same house, and someone else observed the subject's behaviour. Subsequent experiments at considerable distances were successful. One such experiment was carried out in the park at a distance. Mental suggestions to go to sleep were compiled with within a minute.\" Interesting in the context of RHIC-EDOM technology is a statement made almost ten years after the publication of Were We Controlled? Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, the MKULTRA heavyweight, during questioning by Senator Richard Schweicker in 1977 Senate hearings on CIA drug testing responded as follows: SCHWEIKER: Some of the projects under MKULTRA involved hypnosis, is that correct? GOTTLIEB: Yes. SCHWEICKER Did any of these projects involve something called radio hypnotic intracerebral control, which is a combination, as I understand it, in layman's terms, of radio transmissions and hypnosis. GOTTLIEB: My answer is \"No.\" SCHWEICKER: None whatsoever? GOTTLIEB: Well, I am trying to be responsive to the terms you used. As I remember it, there was a current interest, running interest, all the time in what effects people's standing in the field of radio energy have, and it could easily have been that somewhere in many projects, someone was trying to see if you could hypnotise someone easier if he was standing in a radio beam. That would seem like a reasonable piece of research to do. Another statement was made by J.F. Schapitz who, working with the Department of Defense in 1974, filed the following research proposal: http://www.mindcontrolforums.com/pro-freedom.co.uk/in_your_head.html (6 of 9) [9/15/2004 1:50:51 AM]"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Temp \"In this investigation it will be shown that the spoken word of the hypnotist may be conveyed by modulated electro-magnetic energy directly into the subconscious parts of the human grain - i.e., without employing any technical devices for receiving or transcoding the messages and without the person exposed to such influence having a chance to control the information input consciously.\" Schapitz proposed an experiment wherein a subject would be subconsciously told to leave the laboratory, the command triggered by a word or action from the researcher. As in the tricks played by stage hypnotists, Schapitz was certain that the subject would rationalise the otherwise irrational desire to leave the lab. Records of Schapitz' research, beyond the initial proposal, have never been declassified. In a way, proof of the existence of RHIC-EDOM does not much matter. It is not vitally important if Lincoln Lawrence or James L. Moore were speaking from personal knowledge, or simply speculation that they wanted to render more believable. \"RHIC-EDOM\" is in essence just a name that describes a technology close to or identical to others that have been demonstrated to exist. A specific Russian mind control technology was outed by the American Defense News in 1993, termed \"acoustic psycho-correction.\" According to the magazine, \"The Russian capability, demonstrated in a series of laboratory experiments dating back to the mid-1970s, could be used to suppress riots, control dissidents, demoralise or disable opposing forces and enhance the performance of friendly special operations teams, sources say. \"Pioneered by the government-funded Department of Psycho-Correction at the Moscow Medical Academy, acoustic psycho-correction involves the transmission of specific commands via static or white noise bands into the human subconscious without upsetting other intellectual functions. Experts said that laboratory demonstrations have shown encouraging results after exposure of less than one minute.\" Janet Morris, science fiction author and research director of the U.S. Global Strategy Council, a Washington, D.C. think tank, is one the leading lights in the field of non-lethal weaponry which in practice is a nice euphemism that includes techniques of mind control. According to Tactical Technology magazine, \"While visiting Russia in November 1991, Morris and other members of a team sent to investigate Russian technologies for commercial development were invited to a demonstration of a mind control technology A volunteer from the U.S. team sat down in front of a computer screen as innocuous words flashed across the screen. The volunteer was only required to tell which words he liked and which words he disliked. At the end of the demonstration the Russian staff started revealing the sensitive, innermost thoughts o the volunteer - none of which had been previously discussed. The recorded message was mixed with what appeared to be white noise or static, so when played back it became indecipherable. Since there were no more volunteers in the U.S. group, the Russians volunteered to go upstairs and let the Americans choose a mental patient for a demonstration. The Americans declined the offer. \"The Russians told Morris of a demonstration in which a group of workers were outside the hospital working on the grounds. The staff sent an acoustic psycho-correction message via their machine to the workers telling them to put down their tools, knock on the door of the hospital and ask if there was anything else they could do. The workers did exactly that, the Russians said. http://www.mindcontrolforums.com/pro-freedom.co.uk/in_your_head.html (7 of 9) [9/15/2004 1:50:51 AM]"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Temp \"The Russians admitted to using this technology for special operations teams selection and performance enhancement and to aid their Olympic athletes and an Antarctic exploration team. Unlike lie detectors, this machine can determine when the truth is spoken, according to Morris. \"Being an infrasound, very low frequency-type transmission, the acoustic psycho-correction message is transmitted via bone conduction. This means that earplugs will not restrict the message. An entire body protection system would be required to stop reception. The message, according to the Russians, bypasses the conscious level and is acted on almost immediately. The Russians say that the messages are acted upon with exposure times of under one minute. \"Morris envisions this technology will be miniaturised into a hand-held device. Presently, the International Healthline Corp. of Richmond, Va., is planning to bring a Russian team of specialists to the U.S. in the near future to further demonstrate the capability. International Healthline is a private corporation that is exploring Russian medical technologies for import to the U.S.\" A specific application of electronics in mind control is in the direct broadcasting of audible sounds, including voices, to the human brain. In 1961, biophysicist Allen Frey, working for the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), announced that human beings are capable of hearing microwave broadcasts, in the case of his experiments, what he described as buzzing or knocking sounds. Frey suggested \"stimulating the nervous system without the damage caused by electrodes.\" In 1973, Dr. Joseph C. Sharp, at Walter Reed Hospital, while in a soundproof room heard spoken words broadcast by \"pulsed microwave audiogram.\" Broadcast in a range between 300 MHz to 3GHz. Sharp was able to identify words that were broadcast without any form of electronic translation device - by direct transmission to the brain. A 1976 Defense Intelligence Agency report credited the Soviets with having made the same discovery as Sharp and Grove, although this was apparently disinformation in the interest of encouraging Congress to appropriate funding in order to play a pretended \"catch up\" with the Russians. One electromagnetic weapon that transmits at the frequency of the human nervous system is, according to research Harlan Girard, manufactured by Loral Electro-Optical Systems in Pasadena, California. In substantiation, it is reported that Loral had previously done research on electromagnetic weaponry for Lt. Gen. Leonard Peroots of the U.S. Air Force. Peroots is reported to have requested a weapon that would broadcast negative messages directly to the minds of friendly troops. A study by A.W. Guy and others, released in 1975 by the DIA, reported on experiments to determine the particulars of the phenomenon of audible electromagnetics, and its relation to such things a pulse power, pulse shape, and frequency. Along with a number of details about the nature of electromagnetic interaction with humans and animals. Guy explained why the microwaves were audible: microscopic thermal expansion of brain tissues. Guy had even experimented with sending Morse code via http://www.mindcontrolforums.com/pro-freedom.co.uk/in_your_head.html (8 of 9) [9/15/2004 1:50:51 AM]"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Temp microwaves. Also reported on were Soviet capabilities: \"Sounds and possibly even words which appear to be originating intercranially can be induced by signal modulations at very low power densities.\" Dr. Robert O. Becker, in The Body Electric, commented on the technology: \"Such a device has obvious applications in covert operations designed to drive a target crazy with 'voices' or deliver undetected instructions to a programmed assassin.\" As with many other instances of claimed mind control, separating subjects experiencing hallucinatory voices from those broadcast electronically is a difficult task. One possible solution is suggested by Judy Wall, in her article \"Synthetic Telepathy.\", published in 1996. Wall proposed that the effect of microwave voices could be detected with an electroencephalograph (EEG) machine. The main drawback - this technique is that if whatever agency was broadcasting the messages was aware of the use of monitoring equipment, the messages would undoubtedly stop. As Wall states, \"While it is not a perfect solution, it is hopefully a start towards monitoring, validating, and correcting the problem of involuntary mind control experimentation and harassment of innocent victims.
