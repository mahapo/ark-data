[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Underground Hypnosis Course Presents... Inducing A Hypnotic State – Step By Step Guide (In A Controlled Situation) The first thing to do is to make sure that you have agreement and permission. If I’m doing work with anybody for anything the first thing I say is, “Now you agree that we can do hypnosis together and it’s okay.” Okay, so I have their permission that it’s okay to do hypnosis. If I’m doing self-hypnosis it’s probably pretty evident that I do have permission already. The other thing you need is some kind of intention. What is the intent for going into hypnosis? Otherwise it’s just a nice, relaxing sleep. So it might be we’re going to do hypnosis for the purpose of the stage show, or we’re going to do hypnosis for the purpose of helping you be better motivated, or maybe we are just going to do some hypnosis so that you can feel as if you had eight hours sleep in just a few minutes. So we have an intention, a purpose now. So the unconscious mind knows what we’re going for. This is the verbal “Hypnosis Contract”. Whenever either party steps outside of the bounds of the contract the hypnosis basically stops."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" If I were to say to somebody, “Hey, we’re going to do hypnosis so that you can feel as if you had eight hours of sleep in just a few moments” and somewhere in the middle of the hypnosis session, I said, “Okay, now you’re going to cluck like a chicken”, Their unconscious mind would say, “Hey, that’s not playing by the rules” And they would wake themselves up. We have their intention, now we need to do the “Progressive Relaxation Induction”. Have them get comfortable or if you’re doing self-hypnosis you’d get yourself comfortable, and you take a couple of nice, deep breaths, which helps to relax us, and then you can either do it with your eyes closed, or sometimes you’ll do it with the eyes open and have them focus and stare at something. So let’s pretend that we’re doing it with self- hypnosis. You’d go ahead and you’d close your eyes and you’d just concentrate on relaxing, say, your feet. Start at one end and you relax every group of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"muscles all the way up your body. So we’d start with relaxing the feet and then we relax the ankles and you have to imagine that these things are actually happening. So if you’re sitting there and you’re thinking to yourself, “Okay, I’m relaxing my feet, relaxing, relaxing, relaxing”, That’s not really doing it. BUT If you’re sitting there thinking, Okay, I’m relaxing my feet now, and you consciously feel the feet relax and the muscles just kind of go loose and limp, then that’s what we’re talking about. Then you relax the muscle groups up from the ankles and then to the calf, and you work your way up through all the major muscle groups, all the way up the body, making sure you, you know, you get the knees, you get the back, you get the torso, you move all the way up and you relax the head and relax down the arms. Generally by this point the brain is, is to that point where it’s just, boom! Bored to death and you drop into trance. If you don’t have some kind of mechanism set up in advance, you will probably either drift straight off to sleep and sleep, or you will say, Well, this isn’t working and I’m still conscious of what’s going on and you’ll pop out of trance. for instance when I do it, I will tell myself, for"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"self-hypnosis I will say, Okay, I will do the self- hypnosis and I will wake up in exactly 30 minutes, or I wake up at exactly 5:30, so I have a specific parameter when I’m going to stop doing the hypnosis. I will literally wake up in 30 minutes. I do it every single night when I go to sleep. I say, I have to get out of bed at 5:00. I set the alarm but nine times out of ten, I wake up at 4:58 wide awake and I say, Hm. Gee. I’m awake. It must be 4:59. It must be almost 5:00. And then, boom. The alarm goes off. That’s an internal clock and everybody has one and with the hypnosis you can use it to your advantage and it works immensely well. I’ve done it – I will, you know, take a cat nap for 20 minutes, and then I can get on with my day. It’s a tremendously powerful – And you go through the process of relaxing the body all the way up. When you relax down the arms, relax the neck, and I started this technique as a kid, when I was nine years old. The book said, Oh, start relaxing from the head down. But it, it just kind of struck me odd. If I’m relaxing my head, if I relax my brain, and I relax my head and my face, then how am I going to – I’m not relaxing the rest of my body, because"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"once I relax that, then I can’t think. So I swapped it around and I start at the feet and go up. Then my entire body’s relaxed by the time I get up to my head, and then the head when I relax the head and the face, boom, I just drift off. And then – Depending on who you read or who you listen to or talk to, some people when they’re doing hypnosis relaxation instructions start at the head and work their way down, and other people start at the feet and work their way up. Whatever works good and feels good to you at that particular moment. So you’ve already given yourself the intention of sleep sound and be fully rested, I’ll wake up 7:00, and you walk yourself all the way through it and you’ll relax all the way up, there may come a time, I know there did for me, when relaxed my body completely and my brain is still conscious and I’m thinking, Well, this didn’t work this time. The thing to do is not panic and to not say, Oh, it didn’t work. Say, Okay, now I’m relaxed, now we’ll do it again and go even deeper now. And then you go through the relaxation process again. So in that respect I suppose you could say it’s kind of like counting sheep except that you have a specific intention and a specific outcome in mind and the unconscious mind recognizes this and so it gets you"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"to where you want to be. It’s not really difficult to perfect. It just requires the time to work with it within the parameters of what works well for you. For instance, I’ve been doing it for so long and I have given myself the post- hypnotic suggestion that any time I need to get some rest or to sleep I can take a couple of deep breaths and count backwards from five, 5-4-3-2-1, and when I reach one I’ll drop into a nice deep sleep. And – I haven’t tossed and turned since I was nine years old, since I learned these techniques – A trigger is a different word for an anchor, and an anchor is an NLP term. A trigger would be a hypnosis term. you know, you might use, if you had no training whatsoever you’d say, Wow, that really hit a hot button, didn’t it? Or a sore spot. Or something along those lines, okay. So basically triggers or anchors or hot buttons are implanted in the unconscious mind when the person is in a specific state, whether they’re in a really hyperactive state ’cause a trance state also, or if they’re in a very sad or depressed state, that’s a trance state also. and something unique is done with a, with a verbal cue or an emotional cue. For instance, if you were at a really, really sad funeral and somebody came up and patted you on the shoulder and said, Oh, wow, I feel really bad for you, and they touched you on the shoulder in a certain"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"way, that’s setting an anchor. You’re deep in a depressed state and they’ve touched you on the shoulder. They said a specific thing, Gee, I feel really sad for you, and six months later, a year later, somebody comes up and in the same tonality of voice says, Hey, how you doing? Or Wow, that’s just terrible, and taps you, hits you on the shoulder in the same spot – they fire off that anchor. They set off that trigger, and you’ll find your emotional state hitting that same place that you were in way back then. By the same token, if you’re in a really happy state, you’re in a really ecstatic state and somebody says, Wow, that was great! Or if you, you know, you, you’re playing a sport, and you, you kick a field goal and you clench your fist and you go, “Yes!” Six months down the road if you’re having a bad day and you still do that, you clench that fist and you say to yourself, or even out loud, you say, “Yes!” It will change your emotional state. It will change the way you feel. It’ll, it’ll kick off the brain and will send off the same endorphins and you will feel as if you just kicked that goal again."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" We plant triggers all the time. We plant good ones, we plant bad ones. You know, people do it to us all the time. Good ones and bad ones. So it’s really good to be aware of them so that you can collapse them, as we say, or you can plant enough good ones that you can overcome the bad ones.
