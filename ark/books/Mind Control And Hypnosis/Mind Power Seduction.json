The idea that you have the power within you to change your reality is not a far fetched concept. People have be doing it for eons. Some non mainstream religions preach this, and even some species of animals are able to manipulate their reality (but that is a whole other story). So why haven’t you learned or heard about these techniques before? Well, there are a whole slew of possible reasons why this type of knowledge has slipped from your hands (and you could probably come up with some of your own). Some reasons might involve “conspiracy” type suppression (i.e. government, educational institutions), money sucking courses & lectures, techniques shrouded in advanced eastern religions, not the right books in the library/bookstores, info offered in obscure occult publications, or any other possibilities. Much of the mind power information out there is not that effective, in my opinion. My job is to filter all the different forms of mind power usage into one totally effective, totally easy-to-understand book of knowledge that will be your key to unlocking YOUR hidden magical potential. My \"suppressed knowledge coffee pot\" has been brewing all my life ... I’ve had to change the filter frequently, but now the best of all the mind power 'beans' are in one great pot for you to consume! Just like coffee, my beverage of wisdom will open your eyes and get your blood pumping. (Well your pumping blood will be your reward once you implement these techniques.) Just what is “mind power”? Your mind is what you use to think; power is a form of strength. What you will be able to do after you read this book is to strengthen your ability to think. Getting your thinking stronger is accomplished by one main skill ... becoming conscious. You must be"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"fully aware of your true self, your true situation, your true surroundings and your true life. This book will teach you this 'becoming conscious' concept and its importance for mental seduction. An important idea that should remain in your awareness is that there is much more to what you think that exists around you. Let me give you an example. As you live your life, you carry within your belief system that there are certain things that you cannot see with your eyes. You don’t (or rarely) think about these things. You can smell odors but you cannot generally see the odor smell as it travels in the air. You can watch television, but you cannot see the frequency waves coming into your television antenna. You know your food is getting cooked in the microwave, but you can’t see the little microwaves moving around if you look through the glass door. You can hear music sounds from a speaker but you can’t generally see those sound vibrations with your eyes. You cannot see these things with your physical eyes in everyday living but a part of you is conscious of these seemingly invisible things. What I mean by \"a part of you is conscious of these invisible things\" is that it is within your reality to believe that the things you can’t see really do exist. Your reality can believe it or can comprehend it without understanding the detailed workings of it. Even though you cannot see these things, you know that they are going on; it is thus within your belief system. If you were holding a cellular phone and someone told you “hey, what really is happening is that your phone is receiving and transmitting frequencies or vibrations that you cannot see with your eyes” ... you would not think this to be a bizarre idea. It is within your reality and belief system. You are conscious of this on some level if you try to use your cellular phone in a remote location. You know that the airwaves can’t reach you and you might get static. You are acknowledging that the invisible aspect of the cellular phone’s frequency wave (or lack of) is having an effect on your what you are needing to do. You are acknowledging the invisible aspect of things when you put your antenna up in your car in order for the radio to catch the waves better ... or when you put on the lead apron before getting an x- ray at the hospital. It is interesting that you are not able to see many things around you yet you are conscious or aware of the fact that they do exist. These invisible things are not a bizarre concept to you even though you might not fully understand the science behind them. You accept it within your beliefs and it becomes a part of the reality you live in. When it becomes your reality, you usual don’t give it conscious thought. I mentioned before that there is much more to the things and world around you than you know. If you cannot see the TV waves coming to your TV antenna, yet your awareness knows (without thinking) that they do exist ... why is it difficult for most people to believe that your mind can emit vibrations and frequencies that cannot be seen? With all the electrical invisible frequencies that pass through us from all electrical sources, why do we overlook or have a difficult time understanding that there is human invisible “noise” that passes through us? The knowledge that your mind has the ability to affect the events and world around you still seems a bit bizarre to most people. This has a difficult time becoming the reality and awareness of most people even though invisible x-rays or television waves can be accepted. To put it simply ... to the average person, it just doesn’t seem believable that your mind can emit frequencies and effect the environment in the same was that, say, cell phones emit frequencies and effect the environment. You are going to learn about the unseen things around you. You are going to become aware of what you normally can’t see. This non-visible world around you will become your reality as you"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"begin to practice these techniques. Unlike random invisible particles zooming around your bag of popcorn in your microwave without your control, the invisible mind power realms around you can be harnessed and taken control of. This book won’t show you how to actually see these invisible realms with your own eyes, but it will show you how to grasp and mold these unseen forces to do your bidding. As you begin to do this, this new awareness will become your reality and common experience, and then 'frequencies coming from your brain to the brain of others' will not seem so far fetched."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Your Thoughts Have The Power The events in your life and the experiences around you are the result of what you have chosen to allow into your life. Many people do not want to believe this because it would mean that any negative thing that ever happened to them was asked for and wanted. You might not have specifically asked to be mugged but there is something within you that allowed it to happen. Sometimes people can really see how the power of their mind can affect their daily lives. Some of them use this awareness to guide their lives in a better direction. And then of course there is the majority who cannot even conceive of such an concept. The reason why so many people cannot accept this \"you get what you ask for\" idea is that it is very difficult to pinpoint life events stemming from your thoughts when you are not consciously making it happen. When you get good at consciously molding your life from your thoughts, you will see it happen and see just how it happens. If you were to think the thought that you now have a bag of apples in your refrigerator, you won’t instantly find a bag if you went to your fridge and looked. Your mind will give you what you want but it works through the events and energies around you. Someone might bring you a bag, or you might visit a friend and then out of the blue they will have an extra bag of apples left over from the boy scout picnic. Your goals WILL manifest, but you will have to know what to look for and just how to be patient. I will teach you all of this so don’t worry. As you take more control over your power to influence the world around you, you can then change the way that things are molded (as opposed to just waiting for it to come to you). You’ve probably known someone who constantly complains about their health, and no matter what they do ... they are always sick. This is a result of subtle mind power influence. Some people are the types who always look for the bad in others. Their events and experiences will tend to confirm this negativeness over and over. People will always mistreat them because their mind is so devoted to proving that “people are terrible”. I once knew someone who was always stressed out on how much household cleaning they had to do. They always said with such emotion just how burned out they were and how the cleaning is endless. If they knew a little more about the power that their mind has on their surroundings, then they might not be so eager to jump into a fit about constant cleaning. For their own powers of their mind was ensuring that there was always a mess or situations to create the constant work. This doesn’t mean that if stray thoughts of your car going into the gutter while driving is going to make it happen. Your mind really just makes things happen when you believe and feel it to be true. Besides, most stray negative thoughts just get mixed with all the rest and loose their power quickly. If you’ve ever gotten mad at someone and wished them dead, you will notice that they didn't drop dead. There is a difference between wishing, hoping, craving and how the mind actually brings you your goals. Your mind is terribly obedient. Your mind will do what you ask (like a genie) if you ask it the correct way!"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I guess when people criticize these types of concepts, the big picture that they have to deal with is just how the mind can reach out and manipulate events, people, surroundings, etc. This is a mindboggling thing to think about. Kind of like trying to understand where we all came from and how the universe was created and whom or how was it created. It is important for you to realize that if you want to be successful in harnessing your mind for seducing and arousing others, there is a portion of knowledge that you need not to worry about. That portion is the actual scientific workings of how mental energies effect physical surroundings. If scientists have a difficult time trying to prove this, it would be a waste of time trying to explain how it completely works (especially when there are so many different theories out there). I don’t want to waste too much of your time with unnecessary information. You can pursue the physics behind thought power on your own. What you need to know it that it does work; and you need to know the techniques. You could compare it to driving a car. You do not need to know fully how the car runs and how the engine works in order to use the car. If you know that it does work and the techniques to get it going, then it will serve your needs. The more you know about the engine, the more power to you; but it’s not necessary to know the details in order to actually use the car for running errands or something. I will give you the general gist on how the mind influences events, but I’ll leave the Ph.D. studies in this field for you to follow-up on. My specialty is the techniques and APPLICATION. I won’t scrimp you on techniques and you will have a powerful assortment of techniques once you get done with this book. If you have ever studied the art of lucid dreaming you can find a similar (car related) example here. Lucid dreaming occurs when you become ‘awake’ or aware in your night-time dreams, yet you are still sleeping. You simply become conscious in your dream and you realize that you are in a dream. Perhaps you have experienced this, with the usual response of waking up immediately from your sleep once your mind realizes it is dreaming. When you learn to take control with certain techniques, you can become fully conscious and aware while you are in a dream state. This dream world can supply you with unlimitless adventures of your choosing. You simply will them to happen. You make it happen with your mind. Without going off on this topic, the point I am trying to make is this: When you are lucid in your dreams and you find that you are about to loose control or wake up, a simple technique that you can do is tell or make your dream-self to spin around really fast like a spinning toy top. This technique usually puts you in another dream but you still have your conscious control and awareness; you still know that you are in a dream and have full control over what happens to you. This spin technique works. I have little idea of how it works and why it works but it does work. The mechanics of it is not important. It’s the use of the technique that is important. I could do research to find out how this little technique works but I would rather just know it does and get down to enjoying the experience of lucid dreaming. When you learn the techniques that I am teaching you, you might not fully understand how they work. I’ll do my best to teach you, but some techniques are like driving a car ... who cares how the car works, just drive the damn thing. Do you fret before-hand trying to prove to yourself that this machine with four wheels can actually move, and/or how the heck is this possible? No ... you know it works and use the machine. Well, some people would rather fret over whether there is such a thing as mind power influence. They might say 'prove it'. Don't be like that ... believe and trust that it works and get this machine of your mind to work for you. The reason that I"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"mention this is to remind you that there are forces much more powerful than yourself and they cannot be explained so easily. I will try to cover some of these higher concepts throughout this book, just to help expand your mind to new levels of understanding. Discovering the fact that your mind can effect your surroundings can best be seen when you apply the techniques. This world around you is what most people refer to as the 3rd dimensional world. A drawing on a piece of paper would be considered 2 dimensional (for simplicity). The 4th dimensional world is something different though. Some people refer to this as the world you are in when you are dreaming. Others say that you enter a higher dimension when you use drugs. Still others think that this is where you go when you die. Whatever your belief, your thoughts are more easily manifested on this higher dimension than on the 3rd dimension, as this is the dimension of thought. When you are lucid in a dream you could say to yourself, “I want a peach pie to be in front of me” and you will have one instantly. Your dream body can eat it too! If you were to do this in this 3rd dimensional world, you would probably have to go to the store and get one or else wait for your mind to get you one through the events in your life. Everybody wishes a million dollars but few get it. The reason that your mind affects higher dimensional levels easier is that your brainwaves or thought waves are on a much more equal or harmonic scale with that level. Thoughts and higher dimensions go hand-in-hand. This idea is very important and is one of my unique understandings that you need to know. You might find techniques that can be applied to this world around you but techniques that involve higher dimensions or higher levels of awareness will have a quicker and more powerful effect than 3 dimensional techniques. If you want to make a map of a city, you could walk down every street and take note of the roads and buildings. There are probably lots of ways to do this on the ground (car, skateboard, bus, etc). If you want quicker results, you could go up above the city in a plane or helicopter thus getting a better, quicker and easier view. Your map would be finished sooner this way than the prior. The same too with mind power techniques ... if you do it from a higher level, then you will have quicker results. Before we can do this, you must learn the basics about dimensions. We will get to this in the next chapter. One of the keys to using your thoughts to manipulate your life and your life's events is to see it within you using your inner vision. Yes, it’s that concept of visualizing and I will cover this in a way like you’ve never read before in any book. When you see your goal in your mind as if it was actually happening, you are in effect tricking your subconscious or your unaware mind. Your mind’s eye is the like the molding place. This is where it starts. Your mind’s eye (imagination or inner sight) gets the ball rolling and then the part of your mind that can manipulate events kicks in. Much has been written about visualizing; most of it hooky and most of it not completely detailed. This book is not just about visualizing but it’s about how to specifically train your mind so you can apply it to seducing and arousing others. Holding an image in your mind is a necessary step at manifesting your wants and desires. You already see this around you in literally millions of ways. Let me show you what I mean and then you will understand that it’s not so far fetched. Everything around you once began as someone’s thoughts. Let’s avoid the big “God” picture right now. If you notice a house, it is obvious that it is real. You can touch it and you can feel it. You could smell it and even taste the front door and you would find that the house is a real 3 dimensional physical object. It’s there, it’s manifested. If you trace back to how it was made, you"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"will see that it came eventually from someone’s thought. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO NOTICE THIS. Someone had to first think up the general design for the house in their mind. It manifested into the 3rd dimensional world by putting those initial thoughts down on paper as a blueprint. After this comes the manufacturing and construction, all aspects of both began as someone's thoughts. Everything around you started this way. Just look at the things in your life that you have created. If you are an artist, your artwork first starts in your mind and your heart and then materializes with the help of tools such as paint or clay. The way you have the furniture positioned around you began first in your thoughts. You had to decide and use your mind to place your furniture so it looks just right to you. You then use your muscle power to move or rearrange the furniture to your mind’s picture. While we are on furniture, you must become conscious of the fact that the furniture design once began in the mind of a furniture maker. Now this all might sound very obvious and I’m not trying to belittle your intelligence ... but when you look all around you, how bizarre is it really that people’s thoughts create their reality around them? It’s not such a strange concept now when you are reminded that almost everything around you once first began in the mind and thoughts of someone. Therefore, materialization of thought is something that you are already fully experienced in and hence your mind should easily believe that you can get anything you want in life. You just need to become conscious and aware that thoughts can be materialized easily. If you think that materialization of thoughts is a mystical concept, then the whole world is a magical place and magic happens everywhere from the making of a burger at a fast food restaurant, to landscaping a house, to the invention of a lightbulb. Thought started it all. Most people don’t look at life in this way and that’s why your new “eyes” will separate you and give you a powerful advantage over others. Some of you might think that this is not magic. Thought, to blueprint, to manufacturing, to house is not the same. Wrong. It is only not the same in the fact that with mind power seduction, following your mental image ... the universe will be making the blueprint, manufacturing and final manifestation of your intended goal. Understanding that thought to manifestation is all around you breaks down the mental barrier that mind power influence in not possible. When you are using your mind power to seduce others, there are a few factors that you need to know. When you are fully involved in all the techniques, your clarity is very important. What you see in your mind and the way you do it must be as clear as you can get it. Less attention towards the person you are wanting to seduce and a more clearer thought in your mind is how it should work. You need your mind to develop a rapport with the person (I will teach you this) but once this rapport is made, your main umph should be on the clearest manipulation of your thoughts. You’ll see how this all works soon. I’m just trying to give you a foundation to develop from. You won’t get everything at once, but when you are finished reading this book, you should go back and note down or highlight these little pointers. If you are using your mind for arousal of another person, you are doing a form of telepathic communication. You are using your mind and thoughts to try to communicate something to another person. There is a heck of a lot written about telepathy so I won’t tell you what you can find elsewhere. You want the rare and repressed stuff don’t you? There are 3 modes in a human being where telepathic abilities seem to function."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"One way is called instinctual telepathy. This is the type that results when the energy of one etheric body hits the etheric body of another. The etheric body is a word coined to refer to the subtle, non-physical body or shell that surrounds you. Everybody has an etheric body and I shall get into this concept later. The telepathic “message” is carried with this etheric substance and best reaches a person in the solar plexus area of the body. This point is a direct link to another subtle, invisible body that is part of your make up. This has be often called the astral body but is usually referred to as the emotional or feeling body (again, I’ll get to this later). Prana is the name given to a powerful life-giving energy that is everywhere. It has many names: Orgone energy, Chi, Life-Force, Serpent Power, Light Spiral and tons more. I’m not trying to give you a heap of eastern concepts here, just a quick understanding; it will all be useful when using mind power seduction. Your spleen is near that solar plexus center where this prana stuff gets into you normally. Have you ever heard the expression, “I have a gut feeling that ...” and other phrases? These are a result of etheric energies or ideas hitting the solar plexus area and then into the consciousness of the person. Back in Atlantis and in Lumerian times, the solar plexus was the area where the people received telepathic impressions (which mainly took the place of verbal speech). The telepathic thoughts were set through the entire area of the diaphragm. This is mainly lost in modern day industrialized civilizations. When a mother senses danger towards her child or that something is taking place with their child, this etheric instinctual telepathy is taking place. When you get involved in a close relationship with someone other than your blood family, you might experience when both of you start to say something and it turns out to be the same thing. My partner and I do this all the time. We sometimes even crave the same foods at the same time. This is a form in instintual etheric based telepathic communication. This type is a little more specific in the fact that not only is there a link in the solar plexus area but also an etheric connection in the throat area. This later type of instintual telepathy is also known as mental telepathy. The next mode of telepathy is referred to as mental telepathy. Mental telepathy stems usually from the throat area and a little from the heart ... and a tad from the solar plexus area. When you are practicing your seduction techniques, the throat area is where your thoughts mainly travel out from. At first, those thoughts will mainly hit the person in the solar plexus area. As you become more skilled at your mind power work, they will hit the person in the throat area. When you are using the techniques, you will not be really needing to know where the thoughts hit. If you want to use this little bit of info with your techniques, then great. But it’s not necessary because it happens automatically. Besides, I don’t want to clutter up your techniques. I spent years developing an easy method so you can skip things such as advanced yoga or tofu diet life-styles. I will however clutter you up with a little foundation knowledge though. This is because when you understand what is going on with mind power techniques, you will have more confidence, find it easier to allow into your reality of things and most importantly ... to give you a good foundation so that you yourself can advance far beyond the scope of this book. Not only will you have a great foundation for seducing others with your mind (and how to stay on top), but you will be able to apply this knowledge for literally anything you desire. When you become a very advanced human being, your telepathic mode will become that of intuitional telepathy. This is when you are receptive and able to communicate with higher things and for higher purposes. This style of mind work causes your nonphysical communications to be"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"received from area between your eyebrows and sent out from your throat area. Yogis call this area between the eyebrow area the Ajna Center. It isn’t really some hard to understand mystical concept when you know the stuff I know, the same that I want to teach you. It has to do with sacred geometry and how the “shape” of thoughts and energies move and expand. When I refer to \"higher things\" I am talking about things that are at a higher level than seducing someone or higher than using mind power to get a raise in salary at work. I have acquired a deep understanding of ancient technologies. Communicating with the Earth, higher life forms, dimensional beings and nonphysical thought forms are all types of higher communication. When people pray to “God”, they are attempting a form of intuitional telepathy but their thoughts are usually solar plexus based and have little effect. The praying is more out of instinct rather than intuitive communication with their higher self. Two of the strongest ways of defeating your telepathic ability are an overly strong desire to achieve successful results, and the fear of failure. When you are doing advanced mind power work, you must have an attitude like “I don’t care” and non-obsessiveness. Do your techniques but don’t put a huge amount of your energy into worrying about failure or success. When your attitude to yourself is that of 100% pure confidence and assurance, you’ll do your techniques and then change your focus or attention on something else. You will 'blow it off' because you know that your techniques and skill ALWAYS work and will sooner or later get you what you want. When you are trying to make a mental thought based connection with someone, you are creating a nonphysical link between yourself and that person. When you carry a load of emotion into that link, it creates energy that repulses the original thought work. If you are worried about failure or not getting success, these powerful emotions act like a boomerang and return back to you because there is more of an energy link on your side and less on the other person’s side. Of course, you will be a little unsure of yourself at first. Just relax, be confident and do the techniques. And when you are done, move on to something else knowing that your techniques are taking effect and working their magic on the person you want. I’m also not trying to say don’t think about it when you are not doing the techniques. You can think about it during the day if you want. After all, it’s exciting knowing that you are learning and using your mind for seduction purposes. Just let them be confident “yeah, everything is going my way” type of thoughts rather than “what if it doesn’t work” or “I have to succeed so bad”. You WILL succeed if you have the knowledge, use it correctly and then let the power of your mind go to work. This is important and once you see that you can get anybody you desire, you will have incredible confidence within yourself that goes into effect even before you start the techniques. My mind is so developed that just my intent at using mind power techniques starts the ball rolling. When I say to myself that I’m going to do a half-hour of techniques when I get home, my mind starts the process because it knows what I’m going do and knows how I’m going to do it and it knows that I never fail at it. Then often my goals are achieved even before I practice my techniques! This is how powerful your mind will become. The better and better you become at this and the more practice you do, the easier and easier it becomes. So to end up this paragraph, I suggest to you that you detach your intense desire when using these techniques and you will find quicker results. This idea of non-attachment is found when you study ancient hermetic principles. I will mention these principles later in the book. When you are doing mind power based seduction techniques, your thoughts have an effect on"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"your sympathetic nervous system. Your mind actually produces adrenaline-like compounds within your sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is usually related to the “flight” or “fight” emotional responses that surround a threat (crisis telepathy). Crisis telepathy exists on a much more 'danger' level and is the result of tremendous adrenaline-like compounds being manufactured with the person in danger. Crisis telepathy is different than the “mother-child” sympathetic telepathy in that the telepathic connection in a crisis situation reaches strangers and people not normally connected to you in life. Many people have experienced the feeling to look behind them while walking down a street. The second after they do, they witness a terrible car accident . It is crisis telepathy occurring where the person who is experiencing a major trauma is sending out strong signals to the people in the surrounding area. Your sympathetic nervous system will produce the same compounds of chemicals that are produced during crisis telepathy except in your case (if using mind power seduction techniques), the adrenaline-like compounds will be the result of Love/sexual based intuition and mental stimulus (rather than fear or crisis based intuition/mental stimulus). When you are fully working with these mps techniques, these natural chemicals produced in your brain can give you a great rush and will surely make your mind power seduction work more enjoyable. I'll save you the pain of my going into all the theories of just how telepathy works on a physical level. The non-verbal communication link has many different and varied opinions. There are some concrete answers but these should be limited so we can get closer to how to make people fall in love with you. I will reveal to you the exact, in my opinion, way that your thought “comes to mind” in the person you are wanting to seduce. It’s in the next chapter."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Brain Frequencies & Brain Inducers Your brain is like a radio ... it can receive and emit electrical frequencies. Frequencies are the intervals in which electrical activity is measured and charted. The AM dial of your radio covers a certain kHz range. This is the range that the AM signal is broadcasted from a radio tower and then received by your radio antenna. The FM dial on your radio covers part of the MHz range (Mega Hertz). This is the range that the FM signal is broadcasted from a tower and then received by your radio antenna. Everything around you emits some sort of electrical interval that can be measured and charted. Everything from a hug to a lightening storm; from a laser beam to microwaved food. From colors to sound. From the rhythms of living organisms to the different layers of the Earth’s atmosphere. Researcher Dan Winter has even been able to determine the frequency of a person feeling and expressing the emotion of love. Love, has its own frequency range and geometry. Some of these frequencies can easily be measured such as x-rays and radioactive rays but things such as thought waves and emotional waves are still being researched. Since everything is emitting frequencies of some sort, these frequencies are all around you and are even penetrating your body. From the electrical pulse of a computer to the frequency waves of a portable telephone; these unseen frequencies all pass through you. The Earth also has its own assortment of frequencies. The ionosphere is a layer of electrically charged particles that surrounds the planet. This layer absorbs radio waves thus making it a charged layer. It extends about 80 miles from the surface of the Earth and it forms a capacitor with the earth (meaning it is able to store an electrical charge, like a battery). The great inventor, Nikola Tesla, knew all about this stuff. Everytime you plug something into an electrical outlet you are getting a piece of Tesla’s creation into your life. He also invented radar and was the true inventor of the radio (not Marconi). He was very knowledgeable about the electrical charge of the earth’s ionosphere. With the help of a special broadcast tower containing his famous Tesla Coil, he could power all the light bulbs in an entire city from a far distance away using this “broadcasted” electrical energy. If this coil/tower setup became a fully harnessed method of extracting electrical energy from the Earth, you would need to just stick a steel pole into the ground along with a special cheap setup to power everything in your house. Doesn't matter what part of the world you live in. From the remote North Pole to the metropolis of New York. Remember, this is free-energy that the earth naturally produces in unlimited amounts (unlike oil, gas energy which depletes natural resources). For those who are interested, Tesla’s 'free energy system' was bumped out by the industrialists of that time. After all, how could you meter free energy. These days, we are forced to pay monthly to power things in our house ... when Telsa proved free energy could be a reality"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"for the world. Now this might seem a waste of time for you to know this but get this ... When your body moves, those movements are transmitted to the earth's environment around you. The ionosphere layer (also called the ionospheric cavity) has a frequency of about 9.5 cps (cycles per second - was around 7.5 but now it is increasing quickly). Your body is vibrating between 6.8 to 9.5 Hz. Your skeleton and all your internal organs moves in step with each other (coherently) at around 8 - 9 cps. This simply means that your body and the ionosphere cavity around the earth are in total sync together. You and the planet resonate with each other and share energy between each other. Just how far can you share or transfer your energy to the earth’s electromagnetic cavity? About 40,000 km, or just about the entire perimeter of the planet. In other words, the signals generated from your mind and body will travel all the way around the planet in about one seventh of a second through this ionosphere cavity. You know that the farther you get away from a radio station, the worse the reception becomes. Well, the movements of your body spreading around the planet doesn’t hardly loose its strength. This frequency link between human bodies and the environment is why there is a relationship between solar/lunar/thunderstorm activity and human behavior changes (i.e. \"moon madness\"). There is even a similar relationship (if you charted it) to the change in solar (sun) radiation and stock prices. Not only do we affect our environment but the environment affects us because we both vibrate at the same frequency (7 - 9.5 cps). Or rather, a better way to put it, we and the planet are changing in frequency both the same. When you begin to apply your mind power seduction techniques on the person you are trying to win, your thoughts are not just 'whims in the mist'; they are concrete and real and are actually having an effect in the environment (mentioned above). When you understand about the frequencies of the mind, you’ll see how other people's thoughtwaves can easily get in sync with yours. And your environment will assist in this process. As the planetary frequency increases, so too your personal frequency. Thus you will find your power to manifest will happen easier and quicker. But this is a whole other story. It has to do with the decreasing frequency of the planet and the increasing frequency ... thus providing little \"buffer\" between this 3rd dimensional world and the higher levels. You should know that this is the perfect time in our modern planetary history to be learning to develop your mental skills. Have you ever seen or read about those sleep research labs that hook up a person to equipment in order to measure their brainwave activity while they sleep? These EEG machines can show the researchers all types of things, such as when the person is having a nightmare or when the person is in a very deep sleep. Besides the fact the person being studied upon usually is paid for sleeping (and maybe paying their way through university) another benefit resulted from the research. It is very important to your mind power seduction techniques. It is firmly established from extensive research that the human brain has certain frequencies depending upon what the mind is doing. EEG results show that when a person is wide awake, the frequency range of the brain/mind is 14 - 30 cps (cycles per second or hertz). This has been given the name of 'Beta'. BETA: 14 - 30 cps - when the mind is engaged in physical activity and is alert."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"ALPHA: 7 - 13 cps - like when you are day dreaming or in a meditative state. THETA: 3.5 - 7 cps - the exact moment when you fall asleep. DELTA: 0.5 - 3.5 cps - when you are cold out zonked (very deep sleep). [Notice the frequency change from Theta to Alpha to Beta. See how it increases? As I said earlier, the frequency of the planet is also increasing. Could this mean the planet is starting to wake up? An interesting thought when you consider the times we are in!] You access all of these different states throughout your full 24 hour day (unless you’re an insomniac). When you have a highly developed mind, you can access or get into any of these states at will. This is what I hope you will develop when you begin to put this book into use. These states sort of merge together so that you can have high and lows of each brain state. If your brainwaves are at 7 cps, it could be considered low alpha or very high theta. If your brainwave state is 6 cps, it could be considered very low alpha or high theta. When your brain gets into these different states, you experience things differently and your thoughts have different effects on you and your environment. You will be working with all these states when using mind power seduction techniques. However the Alpha and Theta state will be found to be particularly useful and these two brain states will be accessed the most. The lower the state, the more relaxed your brain is. Imagine a bicycle tire on a moving bike. Let the tire represent the brainwave, let the rotation or movement of the tire represent the frequency, and let the person riding the bike represent the brain. When the bike is going at a moderate/medium speed (fast enough to get where you want but not fast enough to build a sweat), the tire might spin around one complete turn 30 times in one minute. If the person started peddling faster, the tire might go around 60 times in a minute. At this point, the person is building up a sweat and of course the person is not too relaxed ... they are working full force. When the person slows down their peddling, the tire might spin around 10 times in one minute. Obviously, the frequency of the tire is much slower than the fastest speed and obviously the person riding the bike (the brain) is very much relaxed. The slower your brainwave, the more relaxed your mind/brain/body is. There are five main reasons why you need to change your brainwave cycle when you want to sexually arouse someone just with your mind: 1) Your brainwaves will become closer to the natural frequency of the ionosphere. If you have been understanding everything I’ve written so far you will see why this is necessary ... namely you will have an easier time manipulating and effecting your environment. We are not talking the clouds, ground and trees, etc ... but your space around you within which you live i.e. energy/time/space. It’s like driving your car at night time. During the nighttime it's obviously dark ... So to move around easier you need to turn your car lights on. When you lower your brainwave cycle to a cycle that’s closer to the ionosphere you are sort of 'turning your lights on' in the ionosphere, so your mind will be able to move around easier; your mind will have easier access to manipulate your surroundings (energy/time/space). 2) Your awareness and your ability to use your mind will become easier and stronger. This will effect all your mind power work. You will be able to access different states of awareness and"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"different levels of consciousness (kind of like getting high but without drugs and their destructive side-effects). 3) Your heart rate will slow down and your bodily functions will relax. Remember in the introduction (unless you didn’t read it) how I reminded you that your 'unaware' part of your mind takes care of all your inner bodily functions? Your mind has to take care of a lot of stuff, from cell development, to blood pumping, to analyzing nerve stimulus, to accessing memory, to digestion, to balance and tons more. Your mind is obviously busy and all this happens while you do other things; you don’t have to think about it. Since you are not thinking about these things during you daily life, these processes are governed by your unaware mind (some people call it the subconscious, but its name doesn’t matter). Basically, when your brainwaves are slower and thus your mind is more relaxed ... your body will be more relaxed and then your mind spends less time keeping the body going. Your unaware mind will have more time, so-to-speak, to work with your techniques. When less blood needs to be pumped to your body functions, then more blood will be pumped to your brain when you are using mind power techniques. Your brain will be more nourished when your body is relaxed. I don’t want you to think that when you are very busy that your unaware mind will put your seduction techniques on hold till your body is relaxed. Having a relaxed body is just a way to help yourself with the techniques. Slower bodily functions is very important when it comes to stomach digestion. Digestion uses a lot of energy. Digestion will quicken when your body is relaxed and when less energy is spent trying to digest that food, then more energy can be put to use with your seduction techniques. If you want to make things really conducive and easy on your energy level, then try to do the techniques on an empty stomach (not starving, just empty). You will notice a difference and your stomach making those digesting noises won’t bring you out of your relaxed brain state. This doesn’t mean that you have to have an empty stomach if you are practicing your techniques in a public place. I’m just suggesting a way to ease your body up during the times when you are doing advanced mind power techniques when you are in a deep ‘meditative’ state. Other things can effect your energy level and I’ll get to these later under the 'increasing power' chapter. 4) You can become more focused when your brainwaves are slower. It’s hard to focus on studying when you a sitting beside a construction site with 10 jackhammers blasting. I probably could get focused because my mind is very highly trained (with practice), and yours will too if not already. But if you were studying for exams while in a relaxed state (even with the TV on in the background) you will have an easier time focusing. When everything is deadly quiet around you and you are very relaxed, your mind will focus even better and your mind will absorb the info easier (unless you get bored and fall asleep). 5) You are accessing different parts and functions of your brain so you basically have the advantage over others who are not trained in this. Now some people might think that getting into these brain states is a very difficult thing to do. There are a great amount of machines that you can buy to help get your brain into these states. I have seen and used a great amount of these machines throughout my life and I found that only a handful were effective and beneficial. If you can get into these brain states with your own mental"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"capacity, you will be better off in the long run. You will be developing the art of 'internal technology' instead of relying on external technology. If the whole world went completely wacko today (perhaps it already is) or World War III hit tomorrow, then your access to outward electronic technology might be limited (especially if something happened to main electrical power sources). Everything you need to become a very advanced human is within you already. Mastering the art of internal technology is the biggest suggestion I could ever impose on you (yes ... more important than mind power seduction methods). You’ll see what I mean as the years go by. If you do wish to purchase a commercial unit to effectuate your brainwaves, do your shopping. Whatever you do, don’t become dependent upon the instrument. When you read the chapter on radionics, you will learn how simple radionic machines can assist you in getting into various brain states (all without the use of electronics). An important thing to remember is that brainwave machines and the like is a growing business. This book you are reading for under $40 will be more beneficial to you than any $1,000 brainwave unit. Opt for the internal technology within you as opposed to the external technologies around you. You will see just how important this is in the very near future, as I have said. Along the same line as ‘brainwave synchronizers’ are audio tapes; from hypnosis to subliminals to new age music. None of these are necessary but if you find you can relax better with them, then use them. Hypnosis tapes seem to be different variations on the same theme. There are thousands of ways to “go under” just as there are thousands of ways to meditate. The secret I find is to just find your own way ... and that will be the correct way. The way you use your mind power will be as unique to you as your fingerprints! This book will give you great techniques, but you will find you own variations over time; and I recommend this. In fact, if you are not finding your own variations, then you are limiting your creativity. Guided meditation tapes are too ridged for me. If the technique on a tape doesn’t feel comfortable to you, then you are stuck with it if you want to keep on using the tape. Music is another thing however. Music is a great tool for me. It began when I was a teenager. I simply got bored sometimes when I was doing my mind power work (remember I was learning from scratch with no one to teach me). When I got bored, I simply put on some headphones and cranked the tunes. This kept my mind alert yet I could get my brain into very deep states. The music actually enhanced my work and kept me company during the endless nights staying awake practicing general mind power techniques. It really kicked in when CD’s came out. I could put a few songs on repeat and never be interrupted for hours; creating a very powerful music/trance state. I found this to be a great way to leave my body (yeah, I do that too). I really don’t like new age music (like Yanni, Indian flutes, etc). You can keep it. I want to mention one very important tape that would benefit you greatly. I would highly recommend it for mind power seduction work. It is extremely powerful and can access unbelievable brain states. \"Wave Form\" is a very powerful tape. It’s not a tape of music but rather tones and vibrations of the Theta frequency range. It is created through the use of a special “tonal matrix” in which a Perfect Harmonic Fifth is the focal point for various musical and tonal patterns. In music theory, the Perfect Harmonic Fifth is basically the third note in a major chord or triad. For instance, in a C chord, the Perfect Harmonic fifth is G. The Perfect Harmonic Fifth has long been associated with healing and altered states, and listening to this interval gives most people a sense of completeness and resolution. This recording is the result of Tom Kenyon's work. Very fine stuff. If you want to get into the geometry of harmonic fifth, read the book \"GeoMusic\" by James"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Furia. \"Wave Form\" combines this principle of the Perfect Harmonic Fifth with a stereo panning technique in which portions of the music and sound patterning are sent to the left ear while the rest of it is sent to the right ear. The effect is a deeply relaxing and pleasant massage-like feeling in the center of the brain. It is not uncommon for people to have highly unusual experiences with this tape such as out of body Experiences (OBE’s) or contact with inner realities. All sort sorts of altered states can be accessed with this tape if you work with it. It can greatly enhance your mind power seduction work. If you use headphones with it (as is recommended), it can take you out of your current awareness and into a deeper level pretty quickly. It can even get you close to a Theta level of brainwave activity because its frequency is in the Theta range. This tape is available through Source Books and costs around $19. You can contact Source Books at 1-800-637-5222. If you are interested in purchasing the cassette, be sure it is \"Wave Form 1\" as there are two. I do not recommend the second, only the first in the series. When you get good at accessing different brain states, you can apply a technique that is often used in NLP. NLP is short for 'neuro-linguistic-programming'. It’s a special way of programming your mind. There is a chapter coming up on one of these techniques that you will find beneficial. When you are using mind power seduction techniques, you will be doing a set of techniques when you are alone and a different set of techniques when you are in front of the person. You can mix and match these to your pleasing. When you are alone, you have more time to develop the art of slowing down your brainwaves. When you are out in public, you obviously can’t get into deep states as easy; there is just too much stimulus. To get through this barrier there is a technique that can put your brain into pre-programmed brain states (even when you are in a very public situation). It has often been called \"anchoring\" or \"keying\". You’ve experienced this when you’ve heard a song that you haven’t heard in years ... and that song totally makes you remember or feel that time in the past. The music anchored you to that time. When you apply mind power seduction techniques, you can apply an anchor for a particular brain state so you will get into that brain state instantly and quickly just like in the example when you recalled an old memory/feeling from listening to a song. The two most important brain states that you will be using for mind power seduction are the Alpha range (7 - 13cps) and the Theta range (3.5 - 7cps). You will first develop your skill in the Alpha range. When your brain state is at this rate, you will be in a relaxed, daydream like state. This is the first key brainwave state for influencing. When you are in this state, your thoughts break from the barrier of time and space. You can send your thoughts around the globe and they will get there and your thoughts will have hardly any barriers in their way. This means that your thoughts will have the ability to get into the thoughts of someone else. You will be able to program the person in this state. Getting your brain into the Alpha state is the first key to mind manipulation and influence."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Higher Dimensional Levels Understanding the concept of dimensions is very important for these type’s of studies. To the general population of the world, \"just what are dimensions\" is a question that is difficult for them to answer. Scientist’s have their own opinion but it usually is just theory. Eastern religions have a great idea but it can be hard to figure it out from their writings or advanced teachings if you don't have the time to study it. When you do come across the truths of dimensions, it is often blurred in fancy language or hard to understand images with a vast terminology. Now, I'm not that efficient to present this whole idea to you in an easy to understand way. This is a deep concept that can go way beyond hundreds of pages. I will try to give you a rough idea of just what dimensions are and why this knowledge is important for mind power seduction (not to mention for your awareness of just what is out there). The first thing you should realize is that all higher dimensional levels are all merged together. When someone talks about moving up to another dimension (and not too many people talk about this), the moving up idea does not mean going up as in vertical up. Nor does it mean an upward change of awareness. Higher dimensions are up, below, around, inside, and every which way around and within you. They are all merged together like the ingredients in a pie are all mixed together. This of course means that you yourself are within higher dimensions other than this 3rd dimensional world around you. At this moment, you are within the 10th dimension as well as the 3rd dimension. The word 'dimension' is just a name given to the concept of reality levels. \"3d\" is just a name given to describe or represent your current world around you. You are tuned to a 3 dimensional world. Virtual reality video games are games that are trying to give you the feeling of this 3rd dimensional world within a computer simulated scene. But as I said a moment ago, not only are you in the 3rd dimension now, but you are also in the 10th, 4th, or whatever dimension at the same time. So if you are within all higher dimensions now, then why can't you see or experience them? You simply can't see or experience other dimensions because you are not tuned to them. It's just like a television. You can't see or experience channel 11 when you are tuned to channel 4. The same with a radio. You can't listen to 101.5 FM when you are tuned to 106.5 FM. Take a look at your FM radio dial sometime. Notice it shows the frequencies in MHz (mega-hertz). 101.5 MHz is in one place and 106.5 MHz is in another place. If you are listening to 101.5 FM and you want to listen to the other, you have to change the frequency. Experiencing other dimensions works in exactly the same way. You have to change the wavelength of what you are now to where you want to be. In simpler words, the difference"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"between dimensional worlds is their wavelength. This 3rd dimensional world has a certain wavelength and you are tuned into it. If you tuned into the wavelength of another dimension, you would experience and see this different world in the exact place where you are now! Wavelength is the key and this is very rare knowledge. Just like tuning into different channels on a TV you can tune into different dimensions if you know how. If you measured all the objects in this 3rd dimensional world around you, the average wavelength would be 7.23 centimeters. In quantum physics, every object consists of particles or waves (sound)(wavelength). It has its own sine-wave \"signature\" that can be measured. This is what is averaged and this is the wavelength of our 3rd dimension universe we are tuned to (7.23 centimeters). In Tibetan or Hindu teachings, this is the sound OM . If you changed your consciousness into another wavelength, the things you see around you would change according to the wavelength of that new world. Life is different on these different dimensions depending on where you are and what wavelength you are tuned in to. Just like there are people on this 3rd dimension, there is an abundance of life and intelligence on higher wavelengths. I really don't want to get into what's \"out there\" but I do want to mention the following things that can make you look at things in a new way. If you remember from your elementary school science class, all our planets in our solar system are pretty much dead (meaning that they cannot support human or organismic life). Venus has been described as a cold and barren planet. Sure some of the planets have abundance of gases and chemical particles but there is no \"life\". What you have to realize is that scientists who study these things are looking at these planets from a 3rd dimensional wavelength. They live in this 3rd dimensional world and use 3rd dimensional tools such as telescopes, computers, radar, radio receivers, lasers and a whole ton of other instruments to study planets and our solar system. What they cannot do though is tune into another wavelength and then study the planets from that different wavelength. If they were to do this, what they would find would be much different than \"cold and barren\". Archeologists have this same limitation as well. If they could map out an ancient site (for example) not just from this 7.23 wavelength but from a different wavelength ... what they would find would be much different than what's hidden in the dirt below their feet. Stonehenge looks like a nice arrangement of big boulders when you are tuned into this 3rd dimensional world but when you tune your awareness to another wavelength ... you see something much different. The pyramids in Egypt look like a great feat of construction/engineering/art from this 3rd dimensional wavelength. But when you change your awareness to a different wavelength, the pyramids are not only intricately built but you see something completely different. In between each dimensions are 12 harmonic levels. If you look at piano keys, the keys from one 'C ' to the next 'C' are five black keys and eight white keys making a total of 13 keys in between the C octave. Dimensions are exactly like this. The keys in between the octave (5 black, 8 white) are called 'overtones'. The points between different dimensions are also considered overtones. When someone \"dies\" they go to a level around the 3rd overtone of the 4th dimension. The 'astral plane' (as some call it), is found on the 1st or 2nd overtones of the 4th dimension. Right now, we are sitting on the 3rd dimensional level. Our world is changing to something very new. People have described this change in a host of"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"different ways. Religions have a vast amount of different descriptions of what is happening and what will be happening to the world. If you are slightly clued into what life is like in the 90's, you probably have some hunch that something is up or that we are all moving to something in the future. Even if you don't feel that something \"cosmic\" like is happening as described by every religion. You can probably sense that environmentally the Earth is changing from all the human's damage to it. Something has to happen from this point of view because natural resources, ozone layer, rainforests, chemicals, diseases, population increases are all getting in worse shape. This is obvious. If you do sense that something maybe on a spiritual side or a negative side is approaching, then you probably have your own variation of opinions of both these sides. If you really don't care then skip this next paragraph. What is happening is that this world is tuning into a higher wavelength. We are literally moving into another dimension. The 7.23 centimeter wavelength is slowly fading out and a new wavelength is moving in. Our awareness of the planet and all life is moving to a new wavelength. We're about to move into an area between the 10th and 12th overtones of the 4th dimension and this is described in a vast amount of ways by different religious, philosophical and 'societal' thought. The 10th to the 12th overtone of the 4th dimension is also known as 'Christ Consciousness'. People sometimes describe this worldly change as the return of Christ but it really means this shift in wavelength to this particular level. We are eventually going beyond this level of Christ Consciousness which a unique experience that will effect all life everywhere. Because of this, 'all eyes are on us' watching and waiting. Beings from higher dimensional levels are watching and observing (without interference). You cannot see them because they remain stable in one or more overtones higher than our own 3rd dimensional wavelength. If you were to tune into the next couple overtones and look up into the sky, the sky would look like a parking lot at the World Series ... jam packed. I won't give you dates when this series of events will occur because you probably already think I'm off my rocker. Perhaps you are wondering how you can change your wavelength to see higher or different dimensions. I'll give you a hint of this later but this is not the purpose of this book. The reason why I have included this chapter is to start to alter your awareness of things and to introduce you to a different way of looking at your thoughts. In the previous chapter, you learned about brain waves or brain frequencies. When you change your brain waves, you are starting to change your 'wavelength awareness'. You are starting to tune into different wavelengths. Changing your brainwaves is not the way to fully tune in another dimension; you have to do more for this to occur. But you are changing your awareness slightly when you alter your brain wave. It's like riding a bike. You are not really riding it until you are moving but pushing one foot down forward on one of the pedals is the start of the process. Your change of awareness starts as your brainwaves change. With regards to tuning into other dimensions, you do not need to work on changing your brainwaves. This is a natural reaction to dimensional awareness techniques (hinted on later). But as your awareness changes by consciously changing your brainwaves, your thoughts have an easier time getting to the person you want to seduce because you are slightly tuning into a different wavelength (not enough to go to a full dimension). Some of the garbage or the \"noise\" that may be in the way clears away when you can use your mind power from a slightly different viewpoint than what's around you."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Your thought waves are existing and travelling in higher dimensions (remember all dimensions are merged together with your mind/body now). The 3rd dimensional fog clears a bit when you change your brain waves and the 4th dimension can 'spark' through a little. One neat thing about dimensions and wavelength is that when you are fully tuned into higher wavelengths, your thoughts manifest immediately. If you are tuned into the 4th dimensional wavelength and you are able to remain stable there (just like you are stable in the 3rd dimension), you would just have to think something and your thoughts would create it instantly. If you thought of a banana to be in your hand ... it would appear and you could peel it and eat it! How this happens is a whole other book but what's important now is that when you alter your awareness a little, your thoughts will have a little quicker effect in your world."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"What You See Is What You Get Visualizing is in fact the secret. Don’t let the idea of visualizing freak you out. I’m not going to give you some far out 'spacey' methods like visualizing crystals while you burn incense. The techniques are easy and very powerful. Visualizing is necessary because that is what using your mind power is. If you know the correct way of seeing something in your mind then it will manifest in the world around. When you are in a higher dimension as mentioned earlier, it is your thoughts or the images that you create in your mind that manifest around you instantly. The same too within this 3rd dimension (except that it occurs slower). The idea of visualizing puts people off and society gives the same concept two different opinions depending on what makes sense to them. For example: If a draftsperson is designing a house and they have to visualize what they want the house to look like, then this type of visualization isn't considered 'esoteric'. If you visualize in the correct way to get someone to fall in love with you, then most people think you are involved in some sort of occult practices. It's funny how an artist uses visualizing to mold their artwork into what they see and feel in their mind and is sometimes referred to as a 'gift from God'. On the other hand, when someone uses visualizing to mold their reality into what they see and feel in their mind ... they are often called occultist, witches or devil worshipers. It's all how you look at it. This type of knowledge is my life and it has nothing to do with 'devil' types of things. My conclusion after dealing with people's viewpoints regarding visualizing and the like, is that if it is non-threatening to their egos ... then it is considered good. If it threatens their egos and makes them realize that there are other people out there who can create their own realities while their own lives remain messed up ... this knowledge is considered negative. I remember my youth when I had to go to Sunday School from time to time. Imagining (visualizing) God and angels and stuff was considered good (I would assume) since they were described much; and to describe something to someone requires the person receiving the info to use their imagination to put together the description. We were often told of bible teachings with the use of strong images and I remember being told to imagine this or that about Jesus. When I mentioned any type of visualizing concepts to my teacher (trying to find answers as a kid) ... I was promptly told that I was doing something in the 'devil's league'. It was around that time that I learned that if visualizing is used to assist in your reality (e.g. artist, builder, computer designer, composer) then it is accepted. If visualizing is used to create your reality then it is not accepted. Remember that you visualize all the time; everything you do and make first starts in your thoughts, so this is how you are going to use mind power seduction. Your mind will obey your thoughts and do your bidding. That same part of your mind that takes care of all your bodily functions knows how to interact with the cosmos and energy realms"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"around you. If you see something in your mind’s eye (your imagination) your higher self will go about and manifest it for you. If you hold the thought that you are always in abusive relationships, then your higher self will manifest it for you and you will continue to be in abusive relationships. If you are always holding in your thought that you are exhausted, then your higher self will ensure that you are always 'burnt out'. If you hold in your thought that you always get lost when you are driving, then your higher self will make it happen. These types of mind power influences come about in strange ways. It’s not so direct because you are not actually using specific techniques to make it happen. Your mind will create your thoughts around you depending on what you hold in your mind's eye. This doesn't mean that your life will become totally perfect in every single way. There still can be some glitches and setbacks and problems. They all can be solved with visualizing but you will find that you will want to use your skill for only certain aspects of your life; meaning that you will only channel it to certain things. In my life, I use these skills for certain things, extremely important things, and I let other areas go 'as the wind'. I just don't find it a good use of time to visualize getting all the green lights while driving (no matter how much I get annoyed by red lights every once in a while). I don't use visualizing to make a store always have sales on my favorite foods ... it's not that important. I even don't use visualizing to totally eliminate the jerks in my life. I've got some real selfish people in my life but I spend my visualizing time on more important things. This is what you must do ... choose what is important and put this knowledge into that. The reason why I mention this point is that I have been told by people - if your so good at all this stuff then why haven't you won the lottery or gotten out of a certain negative situation. You might get this also if you let people in on this type of knowledge. It's just what you choose to use your mental powers for just like this book is geared for mind power seduction and not mind power teleportation. The techniques in this book can only be carried out by you. Some try to get others to do the methods for them but the attempt will fail. Mind power seduction techniques work only for the person who is doing them. The person you are working on might get a little turned on for you but in time the person that your are wanting to seduce will go for the other person and not you! You have to be a part of the procedure because you will have the greatest mental link to that person (you’ve been noticing them, you’ve been craving for them, you want to have a relationship with them deeply on whatever level). This passion creates a very powerful link or connection and others cannot create this for you. Your drive towards that person or your drive to want to have them come to you can create powerful energy between you and the other person. It is best to focus on one person until you get good at the techniques. Once you have practiced a bit, you can easily influence many different people. Just keep track of your work. You can use your mental seduction ability for whatever your 'love' goals are. You might want to narrow in on one person in order to get a steady relationship or you might want to have many different people. Of course, there are some common sense risks with the later. If you use the knowledge in this book to get yourself the perfect mate that you can have a great loving, hot relationship with ... then you’ll be all set for life if you want. If you use the knowledge in this book to get yourself many partners and become a 'love guru', then I can’t stop you. There are pros and cons for both. Try at first to zero in on one person.

All of this will come in handy. I mean it, make a note on paper of the things above. You don’t need detailed pages but just enough of the things that you notice. Watch them and study them. Don’t follow them or stalk them. You don’t want info on their every move. What you want is to make note of the most noticeable things so when you do your mind power work you will have an easier time visualizing them. You want the stuff that strikes you and the stuff about their body (hair, speech, features, etc) only!! If they are good with children or like to watch television ... this is not important. When you start to use the specific visualizing techniques, you will want to see them as clearly as you can in your mind; as if they were in front of you. You might think that you can remember these noticeable features, but when you get down to the work, you will notice that your ability to visualize will be limited until you practice. It might be hard for you to visualize the sound of their voice but it might be easy to you to visualize the way they do their hair. That is why it is good to have a whole bunch of characteristics ready. As you practice, you will get better at visualizing the person. The reason that you note the place where you see them the most is that if your visualized image of them starts to fade and you can’t seem to hold what they look like in your mind ... you can simply imagine the place where you see them the most and then recreate their image before you take them back to your inner world. This will all make sense when you start. Remember, this is only part of your plan. It would be a good idea to plan your time and just when you will use the techniques. You, of course, want to be spontaneous to your heart's desires but there are other times that you need to make note of. Make a little plan of the time that you have available for mind power work and stick to that schedule. If you are using the techniques on a random person who happens to catch your eye, of course you cannot make a plan. The same if you are at a bar or in a public place. If you use some of the in front of the person techniques on someone who catches your eye at random, you will have less of an effect on them until you develop your skill away from the person. Using techniques in the middle of the night while a person sleeps will obviously be more effective than on a person in a supermarket line. As you build more and more skill, then the effect on the person in the supermarket line will be more effective. When you use my techniques on a person, they will feel like it is their own idea. You’ve been in a public place and had the idea that someone was very attractive to you, you felt drawn to them ... but that didn’t make you go for them. Maybe you had to go, maybe they were in the next car going the opposite way down the street. Maybe they were in a crowd and didn’t even see you."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"You still felt drawn to them but you didn’t go up to them. It was your own idea but you didn’t approach them. When you are in a crowded place (for example) and you use mind seduction techniques on a person, they might not drop everything and come running to you. They still might feel attracted to you but maybe they have to go, or maybe they are going the opposite way. Because you didn’t get them does not mean that you were unsuccessful ... it’s just the reality of the situation. Not everybody is going to come running to you if you are both just 'passer-byers'. Just like in the same way that you don’t go running to every person you are attracted to throughout the day. There is a little more advantage if you are in a place where you have an opportunity to meet this stranger or if you know you might see them someplace again. These are the opportunities. Even just seeing a person once, if you know you will see them again, put your techniques to full force. They will think about that first moment seeing you and then things will start to develop as they see you here and there again. A good example of this is if you are in school or at work. There are all sorts of opportunities to see a particular person again and again. Their thoughts (your influence) will begin to develop and then increase. If you interact with them every once in a while then things will develop quicker. If you never talk to them but just see them frequently, they will still develop strong feelings for you but a step will have to happen to bring you two to start talking or something. If they are a stranger that you see often, you could be totally influencing them for weeks and they still might not have enough guts to come and talk to you (even though they feel extremely drawn to you). There are some signs that you will notice (a later chapter) to show that your influence is taking effect, but you might have to make the first move. I don’t mean 'coming on' to them if they are a stranger; in fact you don’t need to come on to them at all. If they are shy, just say 'Hi' to them or make a connection or small talk while you continue your daily mind power influence. Then the next time you see them, you can have a quick chat again. As you say your hellos to them the odd time you see them, don’t show any sign of attraction to them. Let the feelings keep develop within them and let them come to you. It will happen on its own as you continue the influence. If you two are strangers and you are influencing them, there is also a good chance that they might not be so shy and that they will approach you will a little 'Hi' or something. Keep remembering (and I’ll keep telling you) that they will feel drawn to you under their own accord. This is the most natural process of these seduction techniques because the person will feel like it is their own idea and they won’t feel like anybody is controlling or swaying them. When it is natural like this it is more effective, longer lasting, and highly creative. If you are on a bus and you use these techniques on someone, they won’t turn around and make love to you right there. But if you let it develop naturally it will develop quickly and it will happen. If you are practicing the techniques (which I am slowly revealing) on a person that you know quite well, you will see results much quicker. You will have more opportunity to see the signs, more opportunity to influence them directly in front of them, and you will have more opportunity to let them come to you. I'm just trying to give you a rough idea on what to expect but of course you will come across every variation yourself. And of course, the more skilled you get at it, the better the results. If your skill is very fine tuned, you can have every person you frequently or casually interact with ... plus complete strangers may approach you the moment they see you! Reach for this goal if you want. It takes time to get this good but it can happen with practice, determination, creativity and patience."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"To effectively visualize, you must have a quiet place to do this. Your surroundings have to be quiet. It is best to begin to learn to visualize with the lights out. There is no need to focus on a candle or practice mantras or whatever else you might of heard before. Just closing your eyes is all you need to do at first. Eventually, you can keep your eyes open (in public places) and your visualizing skill will be developed enough to do in the broad daylight. Your surroundings must be free of drafts, blowing air, loud noises and other distractions. Nothing is more annoying when you are in a deep brain state and the telephone rings or you hear the neighbors making noise. Obviously it's not possible to get rid of all the noise but do your best to close yourself away from most noise. If you live with people, tell them you have a headache or something so you can have some peace for your work. If you cannot avoid noise in your surroundings then you can put on some headphones and block out the outside noise with music noise. Remember that this chapter on visualizing is starting you on your way to mind power seduction. I will teach you techniques that you can put to use when you are out in a public place, but all this leads up to and applies to it. You should make a goal to practice your visualizing work at least three times a day for 15 minutes each time. Keep track of what you do no matter how it goes. It is better to do the visualizing while you are sitting. Often when you are lying down you get too relaxed and you fall asleep. Also, at first it is easier to visualize your inner reality when your head is in the same vertical position that it is throughout your daily life (unless you live your life in bed all day). That is why sitting is good. You can either be sitting in a chair or be sitting on the floor. If you sit on the floor, there is no need to sit in some yogic posture with your legs wrapped around your neck with your arms in prayer position. Just sit down and perhaps lean against the bed or a wall or whatever. Sometimes putting a pillow under your butt or lower back helps if you are not used to it. The point is to get in a comfortable position so you can concentrate on your mental seduction work instead shifting frequently to get comfortable. You are going to be visualizing the person that you've had your eye on; the person you want. The key to visualizing is to see something in your mind as if it is really happening. This will be difficult at first but it will still have an effect on the person so you must not forget this. My skill at visualizing is so advanced that I can see things in my mind (even with my eyes open) just as real as the things around me in this 3rd dimensional world. As a child, my imagination was so developed that I would have fun creating my own images in this world that others couldn't see but only I could see. I never revealed this before until I wrote this book. I didn't know then that I could use this to mold my life. It was more like an entertainment skill rather than a self- improvement skill. It was when I started to incorporate visualizing with people that I began to learn that my visualizing was actually effecting the world around me. Things changed for me at this point. To see something in your mind as if it is actually happening just takes practice with some consideration to the following points. When you visualize, always put yourself in the 'picture' as if you were living it. Do not see yourself from a distance like you were watching a movie of yourself or something. In your visualizing, you do not see your face unless you visualize looking into a mirror. Most teaching on visualizing tells you to put yourself in a movie-like image so you"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"can see yourself separately. It's hard for people to separate themselves like this and that's why this type of technique is slow and rarely effective. You must be in your imagination as you are in your daily life. If you visualize yourself walking down the street, you won't be able to see your face, top of your head and back ... you'll be able to look down and see your legs, arms, chest just like your 'real' life. If you are a beginner to visualizing, you must first practice a little at first. Here's some tips for general practice sessions. To first start getting used to visualizing, just let your mind remember some event. This isn't a difficult thing to do. Close your eyes and imagine a memory that you had in the past. Don't worry about the details. They always clear up with practice. Also try visualizing different places that you go to in your present. If you work somewhere, imagine that you are at work. If you are a student, imagine sitting in your seat listening to a lecture. At first you don't really see the image with your physical eyes. It's in your mind, your imagination. That is why you can be visualizing a place and yet your physical eyes just see the 'black' of the insides of your eye lids. Your ability to visualize gets better with practice so don't try to rush it. You can still influence erotically without 100% perfect inner vision! You just have to become creative in your work. If you have a hard time imagining something on a seeing level, then try to focus in on one object instead of in a big surrounding like an office environment or at a ball game. It's important to remember that you want to achieve the feeling like it is really happening. You won't be good at this at first but you can trick your mind to believe this though. Here's how to become creative to make up for lack of experience. Actually, when you get experienced at this you increase the following techniques to become more creative than what I mention here. Trick your mind by keeping a slight little grin on your face and the thought in your head that this skill is so easy to do and that what you are imagining is as real as your outside world. When you get good at this stuff and your powers to influence have been developed, this grin will happen naturally because you will be so happy that you have this great ability. You can also trick your mind by incorporating the use of your other senses like smell, touch, taste and emotion. If you imagine that you are in a beautiful place, don't just see it ... smell it, touch it, taste it (if you want), hear it and feel it emotionally. It won't be 100% vivid, but the mind will have enough to work with. If you imagine that you are at work, feel your workplace (wall, desk, doors, etc), smell the air (photocopier solution, smelly co-worker, etc) and imagine the emotion or the feeling that you have at work. By creating in your mind's eye the feeling of actually doing or being somewhere, your unaware mind goes to work and molds this reality in your life. If you see in your mind that your boss fired you, you won't get fired the next day. If you kept up with it though, sooner or later you would get canned. Practice like crazy with this visualizing and you will get the hang of it in a couple weeks. Of course after years of doing this, your skill will be much different than now, but you only need a couple of weeks to get comfortable with this and used to the idea of adding this aspect of visualizing to your life. Your mental work will go to work immediately at your first time visualizing but getting into a new habit is something that needs at least a week to implement. It's like exercising. Your first time produces results; your body is getting a workout or your muscles"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"are working. But after doing exercises for a couple weeks, you will have gotten into the habit of doing it. You will be getting used to it. Once you allow yourself to get used to doing mind power work (no matter how basic at first) you will become more involved in it and more motivated to do it. How many times have you set a goal for yourself and then after a month goes by you say to yourself 'look what I could have gotten accomplished if I did a little bit everyday.'? Don't put this mind power work aside for a \"better time\". After 2 weeks of practicing you'll be more ahead than now and after 2 months you'll be way ahead from now. If you can't motivate yourself then you are out of luck and you will let this skill to the other people who read this book. I suggest that you do at least 3 times a day for 15 minutes each of visualizing. If you want to do more, then you will develop more quickly. If you want to do less, then you will develop slowly. Here's what I want you to do (but of course you can do what you want). Spend the first 5 minutes of your visualizing getting yourself used to the visualizing 'session' and then the rest of the time doing the mind power seduction. This initial practice time is when you imagine yourself somewhere where you are used to or remembering some event in the past. Or this is where you can imagine focusing on an object and imagining it with all your senses. You can imagine maybe a dog sitting beside you. You reach out and feel its fur as you pet it. You smell its fur and wonder why dogs always have that wet dog smell. Don't taste the dog but feel with all your senses the dog being beside you. You could even imagine walking the dog. Maybe you want to imagine an orange on a table in front of you. You pick it up and peel it. It squirts its juice in your face and then you eat it once it's peeled (don't forget to imagine spitting out the seeds). Then imagine letting a cat smell the orange peel and run away with a sour face. You can even imagine this book in your mind. Put it on your mind created table and feel yourself pick it up and flip through it. The symbol on the outside of the book is a radionic transfer symbols charged with a certain purpose (we’ll mention radionics later). If you incorporate this book into your visualizing, the symbols on the outside will be helping you! It's really up to you what you visualize during this first 5 minute period. If you set aside 1/2 hour, 3 times a day then spend the first little while doing this visualizing training and development. Of course to become a master at any artform, you need to practice. Practice is what people like to do the most. That is why there are so few Masters out there and tons of average folks without great mental skills. When you get a better feeling for this practice visualizing you can become more active in your visualizing rather than just imagining something more passively. Make something happen. If you remember something in the past, make something happen like a car coming through the building you are in. Imagine the lights going out or imagine the people around you are instantly wearing the same color clothing. If you are practicing with objects, grab an object and take it with you somewhere. Bring an object into a past memory or a present place. If you used the orange, then throw one of those orange peels at the blackboard in your class or imagine putting the whole unpeeled orange under a car tire watching it go splat! In your mind's eye, become more creative each time. Creativity is the best and most important way to get really good at this stuff. You may develop a great skill at seeing something as if it was real, but if you are not creative then you won't be able to expand your visualizing. Get as creative as you can be but implement this after about a week of simple practicing. The main reason why most people can't get the hang of it is that they give themselves too little time. 15 minutes 3 times a day is just a minimal guideline. Of course, when you get good you can throw this out the door. Then you can do how much, however long, whenever you want,"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"because your mind is trained. But for starters, stick to this minimal (and you might find that this is not long enough). It might just take you 15 minutes to get your mind and body relaxed enough so your imagination can get in gear. 3 times a day is more important than 15 minutes each time. If you do 15 minutes the first 2 times and then 45 minute the third (probably in the evening) then that might be better suited for you. This is what the first couple weeks practice takes care of; getting you in a comfortable routine until you get skilled enough to do it whenever you want. One of my readers practices this stuff as often as she can. She takes 15 minutes after breakfast, a few minutes in the shower, more time on the bus (practicing with eyes open) and then throughout the day, even if it's just for couple minutes. In the evening she says she does at least an hour, sometimes more. She totals anywhere from 2 - 4 hours a day. Her skill, of course, is great and she could probably turn any of you on with just your picture. She finds that the better she gets at it, the more she practices: \"It really gets in my system especially when I apply this knowledge to other areas in my life\". I know this to be true and I do my mind power work for often hours on end. My work is extremely much more advanced than seduction visualizing (as you'll read later) but I can spend 8 - 10 hours a day doing it if I wanted to. My friends around me know that I am usually spending a least a few hours a night doing my 'weird stuff' (as they joke). Little do they know that I can easily out of body travel and easily lucid dream so my nightly life when I am 'sleeping' is very active and alive and not limited to just a few hours of basic mental work. I even do most of visualizing while standing and with my eyes open. Pretty strange sight for someone who steps into the room where I am in a deep trance yet standing. You should try to keep good track of what you are visualizing and your practice sessions. Make a list of what you can practice while you visualize. Keep adding to this list daily. An uncommon event like turning on your television with a remote can become a creative visualizing practice session. Take that remote in your imagination and see it and feel it. See a button and remember what's written on it. Then become active and change the image. Make the words appear different on the button. Instead of 'volume +' imagine the volume up button now reads 'red walls' and when you push it ... the walls around you become red (getting creative). Go back to visualizing the remote and what it feels like and then change another button like 'channel +' to 'hand cuffs\". When you push it, you can imagine that you are now wearing handcuffs. When you push another button on the remote, the handcuffs fall off and you then grab (feel) them and throw them at the TV with a crash of the television screen (hearing). Go crazy with this stuff because the more creative with your visualizing the better, quicker and easier you will develop advanced mind power skills. Keep track of this too. It makes you more active in the whole training/learning process. So this is the stuff for to do for the first little bit of your visualizing session. The next half of each session gets into the good stuff - the mind power seduction visualizing!"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"What You See Is What You Get Part 2 Remember the information in the chapter about brain waves? I mentioned that it is important that you be in a particular brain state in order for these techniques to be effective. You can get success with your brain in an ordinary waking state but your manipulation of the reality around you becomes more pronounced when you are able to lower your brain state. If you forgot, your waking state is the Beta state. This is when your brain is emitting frequencies in the 14 - 30 Hz (hertz) range. When you are in a relaxed state with your eyes closed and imagining, you are in an Alpha state (7 - 13 cps). This Alpha state is the key state for your seduction work. When you are in this state, the effect will be the most pronounced upon the mind of the person you are wanting to influence. Your thoughts will be able to get to them more clearly with more power. Being in a Theta state is also very powerful as well, but it is very difficult for the average person to achieve. Some people take years to achieve a conscious Theta state and some can never achieve this. Remember your brain is in this Theta state at the point just prior to sleep ... the instant before. Can you ever remember this exact moment? You can often remember starting to fall asleep; maybe random images flash or music in your room seems to go on for a long time while only a minute has passed. This is when you are in a very deep Alpha; just approaching Theta. But the actual moment of Theta is the Point of Amnesia. This is rarely remembered by most humans on the planet. Usually they just wake up and never recall the exact second that their consciousness fell into unconscious sleep. Out of body travelling occurs most prominently during the Delta state with exiting and entry in the Theta state. You leave your body every night that you lay down to sleep. Your astral body, soul body, etheric body (whatever you want to call it) 'lifts' and 'separates' from your physical body. It is usually slightly displaced and hovers an inch or two above your physical body. You never remember this because you 'detach' from your physical body and 'return' to your physical body at time when your brain is in a Theta state. This Point of Amnesia is very difficult to control but I will give a technique later because I am very adept at this level of mind control. This Point of Amnesia also occurs when you are born into your physical body. This kind of 'point' is called something else and is much bigger in scale, but it is the partial reason why you cannot remember your previous life before you came into this body for this lifetime. When you start controlling this Theta state, you can start to remember all sorts of things from previous lives. But the draw back is that your thoughts in Theta are instantly manifested and therefore lack of control can be cause problems if you cannot remain stable in this state. To give you an idea of the difference between doing mind power arousal work in an Alpha state"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"versus the Theta state ... if you were visualizing your fingers touching someone in an erotic way while you were in an Alpha state, the person would feel a slight tingling or warm erotic sensation followed by thoughts of you. It's subtle but it works. If you were in a controlled Theta state and you imagine the touch of your fingers on someone in an erotic fashion, the person would actually feel the touch as if your physical hand was actually touching them in person! That is how real it will feel for them! So you can see, Theta state visualizations are a great goal to work up to. Here's exactly how your thought waves get into the mind of another person (if you can understand it). Your thought waves (either Alpha or Theta) arrive outside of the skull of the person you are using mind power manipulation techniques on. From the outside of their skull, this incoming wavefront sets up a resonance or a vibration in the 5 sections of their cranial bone. Setting up a resonance of these 5 sections occurs when the wavefront \"bounces\" around equally to all the 5 sections. If you made a cross section of the skull as this event occurred and if you could see the resonance being established, the wavefront vibrations would form a pentagram within the skull with each point of the pentagram touching one of the 5 cranial sections. This pattern is called a \"fivefold standing wave\" pattern of Tachyons lowered to the vibrational rate (Alpha or Theta). These Tachyons interact with the liquid crystal structure of that person's brain structure. The Tachyons provide Deltons because they enfold energy. This in turn creates ante- matter and matter at the exact same time. When this dual action happens, electrons are formed and an electric pulse flows to the part of the brain that turns electrical impulses into thought ... thus thought is perceived by the person you are influencing. The crystalline structure is found in the calcium bone in the cranium (a layer around the inside of the skull). All this gets into tensor fields, micro-unified fields, electron shells, phase space, and Fourier translations so I will skip the heavy stuff. Now this knowledge is out there but I doubt you will read the above understanding in any book in a bookstore. This is great knowledge for mass mind control through ELF/ULF modulated RF or microwave non-hertzian wavefronts. Controlling people's thought from extremely low frequency waves that bounce off your hydro wires isn't something that certain factions don't want known."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Magic Touch The most important aspect to your seduction work is the concept of touch. You must develop this feeling of touching more strongly than your ability to see while visualizing. When the person is firmly in your visualized place (as best as you can get), imagine that they are naked. Your next step is to reach your hand out and touch them. Use your visualized sense of touch to erotically caress them with your hand. If you loose the entire image of the person that is alright. Just concentrate on the area of their body that you are touching. If you can't imagine what a certain part of their body looks like, make it up (it will still work). Using touch in your visualizing is the most important aspect to arousal and seducing! This skill must be developed and you should practice touching things in your mind so you can 'feel it' with your mind. You don't want to see yourself touching as much as you want to actually feel the touch. In your practice session, imagine touching things like a soft cat, ice cubes, sharp objects, rough objects, things with varied temperature ... anything, so you can fine tune your sense of touch within your mind. Also, throughout your daily life, touch things as much as you can and learn to enhance your feelings through your fingers. When you touch someone in your visualizing you are creating a tremendous powerful link to that person. It is this 'magic touch' that will drive them into a frenzy and eventually draw them to you. Explore them with your fingers, palms, hands and take your time. Let your imagination explore every sensation of touch on the person. If you are touching their genital area then explore their pubic hair, wetness, harness, tenderness, softness, warmness, hotness, quiverness, etc. You create in your mind what you are doing to them and what they are experiencing. Let your fingers and hands explore different areas of their body such as their nipples, mouth, ears, inner thighs, hair, knees, etc. No other technique in your mental ability can compare to this use of touch and there is no way for the person to avoid it. If you do it for only about 5 minutes, you will create effects that may last several hours. The person will begin to feel warmth, tingling, hardness, wetness and a turned on feeling. The longer you use this magic touch the excitement that will build up in the person will be hard to resist and they will have a strong attraction towards you (even if they don't know who you are). They won't even be able to fight these feelings because they are coming from deep inside of them 'on their own'. Remember this will take a little practice but it will hit them even on the first trials no matter how slight. Remember also to really FEEL the touch even if you cannot see it. Imagine it as if you were doing it right now. Soon I will get to how you can apply this technique to people throughout your daily life without having to go into a deep Alpha state but you should include deep visualizing of this kind in your work everyday. In my inner eye, I can totally FEEL the sensation of touch as if I were really doing it. I like to"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"explore the person's body in so many ways. Sometimes I can feel myself caressing their ears with one hand and caressing their clitoris with my other (since I'm a man attracted to women). Women who do these techniques can get the man they are wanting into a great passion by imagining the touch of their own hand stimulating the man's penis. Women should feel the hardness, pulsating, pubic hair, testicle movements, leg muscle contractions of the man they are visualizing (if you are gay man then you would do the same to the man you want). My ability at this is so developed that I can spend a couple hours mentally caressing the person I want. The person is in a completely different mind set the next time I see or talk to them. Especially when you incorporate visualizing scenarios along with your \"psychic\" touching. Visualizing scenarios is the second part of this magic touch. It should come only after you have mentally touched the person. It can be a couple minutes after or longer. What it is, is the extension of your work. If you are mentally touching someone in their genital area, start to visualize the persons reaction. Look up at their face and see their reaction (of course you control what happens). Watch and make their body move and quiver under your touch. Begin to visualize them in the way that you want to see them reacting to your touch all the while still feeling the caressing as if it was happening. By bringing in reactions, you are starting to create an entire scenario of passion and lust. Bring in to your newly developed sense of hearing and tasting and talking within your mind. Hear the person's moans along with your touch. Hear their voice. Begin to make things get passionate but try to do more of the giving than to visualize them doing the giving. You want to keep the job of arousing them and not letting your visualizing become a fantasy experience for your own pleasure. You might get aroused by this by try to stay in control and make sure you do most all of the giving. When you begin to add full visualizing to your mental touching, you can see the back that you are touching, you can see those breasts that you are stimulating, you can see those thighs that you are caressing. Make sure that the person becomes very aroused by this in your mind and especially make sure that they crave you and want you to do more and more! Try to avoid getting too fast with all of this. The slower you do your visualizing scenario and your visualizing touching, the more erotic it will be for them. When I do it, I sometimes spend a lengthy time on one part of their body until I move somewhere else or incorporate something else. This creates a deep passion within the real person and it continually forces me to concentrate and develop and remain stable with my sense of visualized touch for long periods of time. If you add to your visualizing oral movements on the person, you also create stronger feelings within the real person. Remember that you are doing the stuff to them and they are getting horny by it in your mind. You're not trying to get off on this. If you do, your heart will start to beat faster and you'll start to come out of your Alpha state. Of course, you need to feel some of it as you visualize because you want it to be. If you get turned on while doing these visualizations, then keep control and keep your eyes closed and channel this sexual energy into your visualizing. When you decide you've had enough of your session. Keep your eyes closed and return your mind to your imaginary place. You can still see that the person is lying down or wondering why you stopped, but try to explore your 'place' again before you open your eyes. This only takes a minute so don't give it anymore time. Then open your eyes and go back to your waking life."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"When you do this type of mind power work on someone, the influence on them is instant and physical no matter how far away they are. I'll get to the signs that shows their reaction to this work soon. If you've understood anything that I've taught you earlier you might think that it is necessary to visualize the person in the scenario that you wish to happen in real life. The scenario that you visualize should be only to arouse them and not how you want things in real life. Yes, it’s true that what you see is what you get but if you are visualizing them getting horny under your touch and yet you insist on visualizing them in a situation that you insist must happen in your real life, then your mind has to do more. It has to turn the person on and set up the events to manifest the exact scenario that you are insisting on. Your results will be slower this way.

Down the road, once you have a good lock on the person, you can incorporate specific visualized scenarios and they will come to pass in your real life. But it's better to start and wait till you start dating them so things will blossom more openly and freely at first. Once you have the person, then use your visualization to make the type of relationship you want. If you want a lot of intimacy and friendship, then visualize this with your seduction stuff. If you want them to go down on you a lot then, keep up this visualizing once you are dating them. Whatever you use your visualizing for, make the person react the way you want them to react and this will manifest in the real 3rd dimensional world. Your powers of your mind can be so developed for what ever you want. Just as a hypothetical example, if you wanted someone to get turned on by you whenever they had a shower by themselves, then visualize this daily and sure enough they will be thinking of you when they shower. You create the reality and the relationship you want as it develops. Or you can let it go its own way (if it fizzles and you don't care, them move on to someone else). Of course you won't have to continually visualize them being aroused by you, once it becomes your reality are having a relationship then the passion will develop physically and you should stop your sexual influence unless for enhancement purposes. You can visualize to enhance the situation or relationship but this is not a thing that you have to do forever. These feelings they have for you will be as if they were created by themselves so they won't feel unattracted to you unless you start becoming a jerk, don't know how to maintain a good friendship or cheat like crazy. Then naturally they will loose interest in you even though there could be a strong physical attraction. Of course you can still be a jerk and continue having them lust after you (with your visualizing) but this will soon be unrewarding to you as opposed to developing other aspects of your relationship like friendship, honestly, intimacy (nonsexual), playfulness and romance. If you combine all these later qualities with hot erotic mind power seduction, then you can understand how your abilities to seduce will become astronomical! When you are doing this visualized \"magic touch\" and seeing the person you want getting hot and bothered for you, your thoughts are travelling through ionosphere and reaching that person immediately. If you are in a good Alpha state, you are more connected with the ionosphere and your thoughts will travel easier and quicker. What happens to the person is this: First the physical sensation hits them without any awareness. Then they become aware that they are getting a little turned on. And then thoughts of you come into their mind. These thoughts may be very obvious to them and they will consciously feel attracted to you or these thoughts will be"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"a little more deeper and their unaware mind will make more of the connection. The later is not a bad thing because it is better to establish a deep foundation within the person's psyche. Often you might get a little turned on but don't really think about anybody specifically. Your unaware mind has often had some links to certain people and then when you see those people in your daily life you will become more aware of your attraction to them. As this increases, the times when you get a little aroused the thoughts of a certain person will come into your conscious awareness. This is how it might happen in the person you are working on. They might not instantly think hot thoughts about you but their subconscious mind will be associating these arousal feeling to you and then it will manifest as the person becomes more attracted to you. So if you don't see any instant reactions, don't worry because their subconscious mind will be programming their conscious mind to be drawn to you. Their subconscious mind will seek you out only and will not think that these arousal feelings are coming from someone else. Allow this to happen and you'll see that the person will come to you eventually. This won't take long. Remember, since this is a natural feeling that will be developing inside of them (as if it was their under their own accord), you probably will go through the usually motions like dating, getting to know each other and all that sort of stuff. But don't worry, you will be continually imbedding deep passionate feelings within them and they will manifest quicker than if you went through the usually motions without using mind power techniques. These feelings that you are visualizing upon them will last forever. I don't mean that they will feel turned on till the end of time but they will feel attracted to you in the same way you can be attracted to someone over decades. If you are doing these techniques while the person is sleeping then they will dream about you (they might forget the dream as most people do but it will still happen). Some 'experts' might say that influencing while the person is asleep is more effective than if the person is awake. Both are just as effective and both should be practiced. The person's 'guard' or something isn't down when they are asleep because your thoughts get to them NO MATTER WHAT, NO MATTER WHEN. So all this stuff is very effective when the person you want is absent and away from you. But what about when the person is in front of you and you can't close your eyes and visualize in Alpha and just what are the reactions that can be seen? Now for the techniques that can be put to use when you are near the person or are talking to the person. You still need to do the same \"magic touch\" but you don't have to close your eyes to do it. If you properly practice the touch sensations you don't need to visualize anything except the imaginary sensation of touch. Let's say the person is near you but they are not looking at you. Just experience the touch sensation in your mind like in the visualizing Alpha work earlier. Your brain will still produce Alpha waves because you are harnessing your imagination and it will be associated with your Alpha visualizing when you are alone. Just feel your hand go up their dress or down their pants in a gentle erotic manner. In your mind, do the same finger caresses and erotic touching that I mentioned earlier. Yeah, it's a little harder with your eyes open but it just takes a little more practice. As you are doing whatever you are doing physically (working, waiting in line, sitting in class, sitting in a bus) keep your mental thoughts on your touching and caressing of that person but do an added technique: remove their clothes in your mind and try to imagine them behaving in your mind like you want them to be (preferably becoming turned on"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"by your touching and caressing). At first, until you get good at \"live\" mental seduction, you can stick to just the touching sensation. In time it will be easier for you to visualize nakedness and eroticism while your eyes are open. The more your mind is mentally working on this the more Alpha waves you will be producing and the more of an effect this will have. My skill is so good that I can be in a public place with my eyes totally open yet I can visualize something in such detail that I loose complete focus of the 3rd dimensional world around me ( still I am totally aware of it because my eyes are still open and moving around). You will get this good too and then you will be producing deep Alpha waves and strong visualizations even when you carry on a conversation with someone! This is how good you will get. Until that time, don't forget the most important thing: the FEELING OF TOUCH AS IF YOU WERE ACTUALLY TOUCHING THEM. This is the most important thing even as your other skills become slowly developed. This is where 99.9% of your concentration should go. By the way, since I mentioned the word concentration you should never force any of these techniques. Your brain should remain relaxed and not in a intense will power type of concentration. Relaxed, feeling 100% touch sensation plus the added confidence will make your ability incredible without ever having to muster up any will power. Doing seduction techniques when you are near the person or doing seduction techniques when the person you want is not near your are two different skills that you have to develop. There are advantages and disadvantages of both. If the person is near you, you will able to see the effects. If the person is not in your presence (like a night when they are sleeping), you won't be able to notice certain signs until you see them (but at least you'll have more time to use mind power seduction techniques on them). Even though you will have less time to employ techniques if the person is in your sight, at least it will be easier to imagine touching them since that person is really near you. Get good at both areas of mind power seduction and learn and develop from both. When you do this, your different skills will cross over; you will be able to picture them better when you are not near them and you will be able to better visualize sexually when you are near them. When you are touching someone sexually with your mind power fingers, you will see many different things occurring. At first practice (and during your beginning skill) the person being influenced will start to get turned on but might not consciously associate it with you and will probably try to hide it (because they are in public). Eventually if you keep up the work on them, they will be drawn to you as their daily (or whenever) arousal keeps increasing. They will probably still hide it in public to an extent. If in a bar or in a relaxed place, they will probably flirt or unconsciously flirt. If in a place like a workplace, or school they will probably keep hiding it. Of course, it will get to them sooner or later and they will want to get to know you in whatever way they feel comfortable. If you have been working on them for a couple of weeks and you know that they must be feeling some sort of deep attraction to you, they still might be a little shy to approach you (especially if they don't know you). If this is the case, you should try and ease them through these new feelings by saying the first 'Hi', or aim to be near them alone for a few minutes. This is will get a chance for a meeting to take place which will increase the attraction because now the ice has broken."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"When the person is within your sight, you will be able to see the effects of your mind control. It's very important for your development that you notice these signs. The signs show you just how you are progressing. The better you get, the more of a reaction you get. If you don't see a reaction at first, don't despair. It just takes a little practice and pretty soon you will be seeing results. Once this occurs, you will become more and more motivated to do this work. As you mentally caress them (especially in the genital area) you will notice some of the following: Touching in the area you are influencing, scratching in different areas, heat/wetness/erection produced, worried or puzzled expressions, shifting position, crossing/uncrossing their legs, touching their hair, arranging clothing, lighting up a cigarette, eating, laughing and any movement that seems to be a reaction or cover-up from your influence. Sometimes the person will feel so turned on that they freeze up and try to leave the room due to the strong excitement factor. Sometimes they will feel drawn to look around and make eye contact (even if they are not consciously turning to look at you). . If you are doing this while speaking to the person on the phone, you might hear breathe changes, shifting noises, coughing, change in voice, changing topics and maybe even flirting. You, of course, will NEVER let them in on your secret ... NEVER. If you do, then their 'walls' might be too strong for you to break if you are inexperienced. Really take careful notice of the reactions and write them down for your study if you wish. If you are in a classroom or workplace, then you have a longer opportunity to do these techniques. If you are in a line in the supermarket, then you will have less time to do this and might see less reaction. But always remember that the effect is taking place. One of the best things you can do is to practice like crazy everywhere you can. And you can even practice on the same sex (even if you are not gay). If you are just practicing, then you are not trying to necessarily get someone turned on to you but rather you are trying to fine tune your skills and get reactions. You can sometimes get a great reactions by doing mental touching techniques on anybody you see. If you practice everywhere you can, you will experience the different time lengths you have to work with (someone in line compared to someone sitting in front of you in class). My skill is so good that I even practice on live television broadcasts. The signs are much more hidden since the person doing the live broadcast has been trained to 'stand still'. Since television usually shows the reporter from the chest up, I can study minute details in the face, eyes, ears etc. I don't want to look for the signs too much in this practice scenario because I am putting most of my thought into my psychic erotic touch. You have to be well practiced to see results (reactions) in live television. I get good reactions in this case when I mentally insert my fingers into the reporter’s mouth ... sometimes they blunder their speech. In a public place, you can do these techniques without even looking directly at the person. Glancing is normal in social situations but staring too may make the person uncomfortable. Check them out for a moment then look away and do your 'touches'. Remember you want these techniques to be as secret as possible, so you never hold yourself like you are some god with incredible powers emanating from your eyes. When you get good, you can do other things while you are doing your techniques so you blend in completely with the humans around you. If you are behind the person at any distant, you can look at them but you should be smart when you have eye contact with them. Eventually you can mentally touch them even while you are talking to the person. You carry on a conversation (not sexual in nature) but you inner eye is feeling with 100% touch whatever part of their body you want. The less you do flirty type actions or"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"conversations while you are doing mind power techniques, the more they will feel drawn to you on their own (since they think you are not provoking or trying to stimulate them with flirting). Keep the macho talk for the people who don't know these secrets. Make sure your conversations are fun, at ease and take an interest in them without any sign of direct flirting. This won't cause any blockages in the other person as your mind seduction powers hit their mind through the back door. At first the person will become nicer to you and will become more talkative; you know, more friendly. Rejection will also decrease after a couple weeks if they have ever considered you 'not their type'. This attitude is changing. Near the end, the person will probably feel drowsy a lot and be very affectionate towards you. If you are prone to doing long intense visualizing sessions, the person will have a brightness in their eyes and will also experience tiredness or insomnia. Look for all these clues because they show you that things are changing. Just because you might not see a lot of noticeable reactions does not mean that you are ineffective with your methods. Every person is different and every person takes their own time. Just keep up with it and you will get that person sooner or later! Besides physical reactions that you can notice, there will be a host of behavioral or overall reactions to watch for. These are the signs of a person's changing attitude. These will begin from a few days after you start your work on them to when you finally get them (romantically, sexually or both). When this happens, you should cease your mind power seduction and work on developing the relationship. If you keep doing it constantly, your mind will never learn that it was finally successful and thus can relax and enjoy the rewards. At first the person will become nicer to you and will become more talkative; you know, more friendly.

Just keep up with it and you will get that person sooner or later!"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Increasing The Force As you begin to understand and use these techniques in your life, you can move beyond their basic methods and expand them to generate more power. Any books you can get on mind power or psychic techniques can be useful and you can grab bits and pieces from these different sources for your benefit. To be honest, I have given you enough foundation of how your mind can influence around you so that you can even go to a book store or library and jot down some points from various books. Obviously, the more you study things that are considered 'occult' the more things you can find. Everybody finds their own ways of increasing their power to influence. Some practice Yoga, some do Tai-Chi, some implement Karate training, some do Pranayama (yogic breathing), some get into crystals and stuff, some use subliminal tapes and self hypnosis techniques, some try magick, some try Tantric Sexual Yoga, some use brainwave inducing devices and the list goes on. The reason why I am not going to discuss some of these things mentioned above is because I don't want you to think that you have to do a lot of other 'holistic' training to use mind power seduction techniques. You can if you wish, and it will increase your power, but you get involved into what you want if you want. I would rather teach you more rare knowledge because all the above interests are readily available (except maybe Pranayama) if you seek them out in your city. Radionics/psychotronics/Psionics are very rare. Have you ever heard of them? These are great tools for your development and mind power seduction abilities. They allow you to increase your power by far without having to get into a 'new age' life-style. The information of radionics and the like will be in the next chapter. For this chapter I will give you some general information which will increase your power to influence. I'm sure that you will find it a great asset to your mind power seduction work. These pointers and additions will be brief but hopefully they will get you on you own path of exploring other ways to enhance your power. I will first start with how to approach the Theta level of brainwave activity for mind power seduction usage. Since full conscious Theta manipulation is a very advanced subject and is only accomplished by a handful of people ... I will not go into detail in this book. Besides, when you are able to remain conscious while in a Theta state, you won't want to be spending your time on mind power seducing or arousing. As mentioned in a previous chapter, your brainwaves emit a Theta frequency at the moment just before sleep. To incorporate mental based seduction techniques with this Theta brain state is very easy to do in practice. This should never become your choice of techniques since it is only an enhancer to your Alpha work (a good enhancer that is). The procedure is to do your usual Alpha visualizing but instead of doing it during the day or in an evening session, you want to do it when you are in bed and ready for sleep. Make sure you are ready for sleep and you won't need to get up and set the alarm or whatever. It's very simple ... just keep up your visualizing as long as possible as you drift into a sleep. As stated in the earlier"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"chapter, you won't be able to remember the exact moment that you fall asleep, but let your visualizing be the last thing in your thoughts. Of course, you cannot force this action and expect to consciously notice something. Just do your visualizing and soon you'll be asleep. The moment you do fall asleep, your Theta brainwaves will pass through those thoughts or visualizations and give them a great burst of energy. What usually happens in most situations is that just a few minutes or so before you are about to fall asleep, you change body position and stop what you are doing (thinking, listen to music, etc). You usually don't remember when this happens so it's hard to stop this. However with practice and self-programming, you will remain visualizing until you reach the Theta state. After that, you will stop visualizing (because you are now asleep) but all you need is that quick moment of Theta. Remember when I mentioned that if you are in a Theta state the person you are working on will actually feel your mental touches as if a hand was really there? Well this will happen at that moment if your visualization remains stable up to this point. It will be quick and instantaneous, but it will have a great effect especially since you will be doing Alpha work (deep Alpha) as you slowly drift into sleep. It's like giving your visualizing a shot of electricity at this moment of Theta. It is important that you give some time to develop your own self by using your mind power skill. I spend equal time using mind power techniques to accomplish any goal and equal time using mind power techniques to develop myself. And yes, I mean equal. This way no only does your skill develop for mental persuasion but yourself as a person develops too. This will give you greater power in the long run. It's up to you what you want to develop within yourself other than mental abilities at seduction but you can use mind power to do it. Spend some time visualizing other things to enhance your life (job, money, friends, knowledge, memory, etc). Since you are in an Alpha state when you visualize, you will be in the perfect state to influence your own mind and hence your own reality with other aspects of important things. Just visualize yourself as if you were all ready the way you want to be (e.g. ... with a promotion, with a new car, getting the audition, people treating you with respect, improved health, etc.). One of the best things you can do that relates to mind power seduction is to spend time visualizing yourself with tremendous powers of seduction. See yourself having easy success at it, see yourself influencing people easily, see other people being jealous of you because the opposite sex always falls for you, see yourself in the way that you want yourself to be after practicing mental seduction for a year, see yourself always with a grin knowing that you always get any person you want, or whatever. If you do this, it will quicken the results of your mind power seduction work because you are literally molding yourself into becoming powerful at it as you do become powerful at it. Your diet can greatly affect your mental powers. Consuming a great amount of junk food and meat puts more work into your body; energy that could better be spent on mind development. I'm not going to preach diet stuff on you that's why I'll keep this short. If you change your diet to that of a no meat, no junk food diet, it won't be too long before your visualizations become clearer and easier since your body is cleaning toxins and chemical additive out of your system. Your blood will be cleaner and this will nourish your brain and soul. I never really understood this till I began studying yogic Pranayama and the geometry behind chemicals. It's really beyond the scope of this book to give you 'spiritual' aspects of a good diet. All you need to know is that it is very important since the body uses much energy for digestion. The toxins in meat and chemical created foods do take their toll even though you probably won't want to admit it. Some of the"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"chemicals are deliberately added to food for psychological manipulation (but that's a whole other story). Just try to eat healthy. And of course, exercise helps tremendously. You will gain more self-confidence, endurance, discipline and a healthy heart and mind. Avoid drugs when doing mind power work. You might think that it will enhance your work. But the 'enlightenment' you think you experience when you are high is chemical induced as opposed to the enlightenment you will experience from a developed, trained and practiced mind. The later type of a high you won't loose ... as your awareness grows and changes your life does. Often with drugs, you experience false awareness’ that go away as you come down or wake up the next morning. Combining drugs and mind power will ensure that your brain and mind never develops naturally and you will usually get caught in the 'trip' rather than focusing on the seduction. Besides, if you ever learn to use your mind to literally take yourself into higher dimensions with the Merkaba field mentioned in a later chapter ... your experience will be better than any drug! Any mind power work that you do whether it's seducing people, travelling to other dimensions, out of body travelling to the past or whatever - you must have a little understanding of Hermetic Philosophy. This philosophy embodies the following principles: 1) Every human is a transmitter and receiver of impulses that exist and live within a specific wavelength. 2) These impulses can be detected by a trained mind. 3) A human individual's subconscious mind is interconnected with the 'universal' subconscious. Within all individuals is the holographic duplicate of then entire universe. 4) Intuition is the what you use to become receptive on this level. 5) The \"feeling of knowing\" transmits like a radio with this wavelength. Now these 5 principles might not be too clear to you on first sight and this stuff can get very in- depth (like any philosophy) ... so here is the basic gust that will apply to your mental powers. To access the universal matrix (God, source of all consciousness), you are required to do things that seem 'counter opposite' to what you normally do. If you hope for things you are implying an uncertainty and a desire in the future which has yet to be fulfilled. If you imagine for things, you are anticipating the future and are not uncertain. This there is a fine line between the idea of hoping compared to imagining (or creating). Here it is in even clear terms. Hermetic principles only operate in the present. If you want something in this material 3rd dimensional world, and it can be reasonably available to you, all you have to do is transmit that want to your subconscious mind. Your subconscious mind will create your wishes only if the desire is transmitted properly to it from your conscious mind. Now here's that fine line ... to make your desire successfully reach your subconscious mind (connected with the universe), your conscious mind must cease to exercise the desire. As long as the conscious mind wants something, the very act of wanting implies a future tense in regard to fulfillment. Since your subconscious only deals with the present moment, any idea that is offered to it that is not in"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"context with the present moment, that idea will be ignored. So the way that you apply this to your mind power seduction work is that you must 'see' your desire as if already satisfied; as if you were doing it in the present. This highlights what I've stated many times: that when you do your psychic touches you must feel it 100% and feel it as if it was happening in the present. The same goes for when you are doing seduction 'scenario' visualizing. You must see and feel (with visualizing) the scenario as if it is happening in the present. Of course, you do this to the best of your ability and you will still get results even if you cannot feel the total present tense in your visualizing. The more you feel and experience your visualization work as if it were in the present moment, the quicker your results. Let me tell you a tip that I've discovered - you can trick your subconscious mind if you can act or pretend. If you have a hard time feeling the 'presentness', you can pretend to feel it until it starts to feel real. If you hold yourself as if it is happening in the present moment (even though you are acting) you will find that real feeling of present awareness with your visualization will come to you easier. Actors and actresses can do this very easily. They can feel a situation as if it were really happening in the present even though they are pretending to be someone else in someone else's situation. Once the performance is done though, they go back to their lives. You can do the same but don't stop the feeling ... continue it until your visualizing becomes real. And don't just feel (or pretend to feel) the present tense in your visualizing. When you are done, hold yourself or feel yourself as if you actually had touched or experienced something with that person. If you had actually had a seduction encounter with someone for real, you would be thinking about it and remember it later wouldn't you? Do the same after your visualizing even if it is just a little bit. Keep a inner smile on your face because you got to caress and seduce the person that you desire. You are training yourself to not only visualize the experience as if it was happening but you are training yourself to live the experience as if it was a part of your life. This Hermetic process is difficult for most beginners to apply. It requires you to believe that a desired condition exists before it can be manifested in the physical world. If you WISH for a desired state, or HOPE that it will come to pass, you are automatically thinking in the FUTURE tense. As long as you want something, and the want remains unfulfilled (on this 3rd dimension), your aspirations are centered in the future and cannot be transmitted to the eternal now of the subconscious. Hence, \"desire nothing and there is nothing you shall not realize.\" Don't hope for your desire but live them and experience them as if they were happening. Do this with your visualizations and into the way you carry yourself and feel your thoughts throughout the day. Your subconscious is a force that awaits activation and response through knowingness and certainty - thus \"Blind Trust\". The mind is not capable of bringing anything to pass except when it is accomplished by the emotional counterpart of the idea. Feeling is the secret. You obtain your desire by feeling as if you already had what you want. I will finish this chapter with some techniques for dealing with resistance. Don't let the mention of resistance worry you. The mind power seduction techniques I have given you in this book are not direct domination type. Your are not forcing the feelings in the person. You are creating the feelings in the person and they will manifest in their own mind as if it was their own idea. They will always feel turned on by you or attracted to you with these techniques but they might resist it for many reasons. Perhaps they are married or live far away from you and they are avoiding"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"thinking about you in these new ways. Perhaps you were not normally their type and they are now confused as to why they find you attractive. Or perhaps they have much peer pressure on what a lover should be or look like and showing up with you might make they \"look bad\" to their friends. If this last one is the case, they are probably not mature enough to want to have a relationship with you anyway. Perhaps the person is normally very religious or have a very religious family ... that person will probably suppress that they want to make love to you or avoid you because you come from a different religious background. A lot of things might cause resistance and the person you are working on will try to suppress these new love thoughts of you. If they are resisting, they may show fear, withdrawal or begin to reject you. Signs of resistance are things that you should notice and write down as with all noticeable reactions. By noticing reactions (good or bad) you will get a better idea of how to best approach your specific mind power techniques. I really shouldn't say \"good or bad\" because any bad sign is a good sign. Signs of resistance show you that things are starting to work. All it means is that it will take longer for the programming to work. It does not mean that your efforts will not work. So here's how to deal with resistance completely which will further guarantee your success. 1) You can apply more intense and longer visualizing until the person's resistance breaks down. This will boost your power even if the person is suppressing their feelings or ignoring you. They will learn that resisting you will cause more visualizing on your part (of course, this is all on an unconscious level since they don't consciously know that you are using mind power techniques on them). 2) You can make a U-turn and visualize them very much wanting to achieve your goal yet at the same time in your visualizing, you give them the cold shoulder. While you visualize, make them want you and be so eager to please you yet you blow them off and reject them. This can also break the person's resistance completely because their mind cannot understand this influence or how to solve it and therefore the person is without defense. 3) You should cease doing your mind power techniques for a few days and then start again with more force. Continue this stop and starting if the person still resists. These pauses can be very effective because when you are holding off on your techniques for a few days, the unaware mind of the person feels that the pressure is off and the person begins to let down their defenses. When the defenses go down, all your visualizing begins to creeps into the person's mind. When your mental images are blocked, they don't fade away. They just 'hand around' until an open is made into the person's mind. If the person is resisting, the visualizing you have done just waits and accumulates until there is a clear opening into the mind (such as when their defenses are down). 4) If the person is showing signs of being fearful about the new horny feelings you are creating in them, use your visualizing to slow down the passion. A gentle touch is often needed and then you can slowly build up the visualizing to erotic, intense levels. Visualize being friends at first and doing friend things (non-threatening) and then work up to lustful things after a few weeks. This technique is important if you are trying to get a person to fall in love with you. You first visualize being happy and comfortable with you; maybe laughing and playing and then put in the sexual scenarios when you have fully instilled the 'safe' scenarios. 5) If their unconscious mind can't handle the load of your influence, the person may even try"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"getting away from you. This can occur even if they don't even know you but they are resisting unconsciously. It doesn't matter how far the distance (the farther the better) since their defenses will go down and you can continue to do your work and your influence will gain entry into their mind much easier. The only problem is that you won't be able to monitor their reactions or signs of changed behavior, but that's OK because sparks should fly the next time they see you. And if you keep up with it during after they move, they will begin to miss you like crazy. If the person you are working is resisting to some extent, then work with one or all of these techniques. Be very alert of their signs so you can use the best technique. Some people get ill from energy/strength loss when trying to wrestle against your influence. Sooner or later, their subconscious mind will give up if you keep up the work. They will become yours. Every person is different and every situation is different so enjoy this diversity because it will fine tune your mental abilities and give you great experience at this type of work for future efforts. The next two chapters will give you some IDEAS on some more ways to increase your power. One is on radionics (as mentioned earlier) and in the other one I talk about neurological triggers and anchors."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Radionics, Psionics, Sacred Geometry There are many technologies that are kept hidden from the average person.

When I refer to the word “technologies”, I am not referring to massive electronics, hardware, computers or billion dollar machines. These are not that type of technologies. But rather they are mind-based, etheric connecting representations and connectors. This probably doesn’t make much sense at this point but it soon will. In order to understand these technologies, I will refresh you on the basics: The world around you and all the things in it are more than what you see. Your physical eyes can only see things which you consider physical because of limitations imposed upon all humans eons ago. That means that if you removed your limitations on what your eyes can see, then you will see many other things other than the physical surroundings. Most people would think “Well what else is there to see?” My response is ... “lots!” The things you see around you (including people and especially people) are not just physical in nature. They all have physical qualities but they also have other qualities as well. They exist on other levels. One level of existence is on this physical world or more properly termed with the limitations of physical language ... the third dimensional level. There are more levels than this third dimension. Too many, in fact, to count. One thing about these levels is that they all coincide or merge together like all the ingredients to make a pie merge together to form the completed pie. With regards to radionics and other side-technologies of the same family, the other level we are interested in is what is commonly called the “etheric” level. In actuality it is not called this, but this is an English world associated with this level and so it has stuck. Another level that you might heard of has been called the “astral” level. There are twelve overtones between levels (or dimensions or octaves). As stated before, the physical world is on the third dimensional level. The astral level exists on the first and second overtones of the 4th dimension. This “astral plane” is where you first go to when you leave your physical body. The “etheric plane” is lower than this astral level being more near and connected with the 3rd dimension. Everything you see around you occupies higher levels other than this physical plane. To get to the point, all physical objects and structures (including people) have an etheric structure. Your physical body is not the only thing moving and functioning. You also have an etheric body; an invisible body that can been seen when you move up to higher levels or train yourself to see this level with your physical eyes. All objects have an etheric body as well as a physical body. Cars, trees, books, food and even things that you can’t see with your eyes such as music vibrations, smells and ... thoughts!"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Thoughts exist on higher levels such as the “etheric” or “astral” and can actually be seen when you access these levels. With skill, practice and knowledge your thoughts can be seen on this physical world so you can make an image of something appear in front of people if you had the know how. This might sound bizarre, but you and everyone around you actually does this already in a slightly different way. Remember ... Every human-made thing you see around you once began as a thought. Take a T-shirt for example. The design for the shirt began in someone’s thoughts. The chemistry of the inks or fiber structure in the shirt once began and was created by someone thinking about it; using their thoughts to design it. The machines that made the shirt first had to be thought of by someone (probably an engineer) who transferred their thoughts onto paper or computer as a new design. When you look at this concept of making your thoughts appear in front of people in this sense, it won’t seem so far fetched and this is the first step for breaking down the limitations in your mind that you cannot “manifest things out of the blue”. The music a musician creates first begins in their thoughts. Whether it’s the thought of how they want it to sound exactly or the thought of maybe “I should try this to see how this sounds”. Once the CD is pressed, you have a physical object that once began as thought: from the music, to the artistic designs on the CD, to the actual machinery designed to make the CD ... all components from thoughts. This etheric level can be accessed in many ways from this physical level. One way to do this is through radionics. Radionics make the connection or the link from the etheric plane to the physical plane and visa versa. A radionic machine can make a connection to the etheric body of a tree or to the thoughts (etheric level) of a person. And since you and your mind exist on all these levels at once, the radionic machine is really only helping your mind and awareness to make the connection. It is really your mind that is doing the work but with the help of the radionic “machine” to make the connection between the nonphysical world and the physical world. Compare it to reading a map. Your mind is really doing the work but it gets is bearings with the help of the map. The map is only helping your mind to sort and arrange information in the correct way to get your bearings and give you direction. The same applies with the radionic machine. It is only helping your mind to sort and arrange information in the correct way to get your goal working in the right direction and the best way. Since radionic machines are only mind/etheric connecting tools, they do not have to be full of complicated physical components. That is why this knowledge is kept hidden from people. Radionics works with settings that makes links between thoughtwaves to events/goals. Your mental link in a part of the machine often called the \"well\" allows the flow of Prana, Chi, life force from the radionic device to reach your target or goal. The setting (“rate”) that you establish with the \"stick pad\" increases the energy towards a specific action (your goal). The rate is a representation of a specific action that you wish to carry out. When you use radionic applications for the betterment of humans and the planet (such as finding missing children, preventing earthquakes, making soil fertile in dry Third World countries) then the full truth of radionics comes to you in time (as a reward from higher sources) as it did for me. The highest form of radionics require the use of no physical instruments or things at all (internal radionics). It is just done by thoughts alone! This is my specialty and requires very secret knowledge. Since your thoughts are real on a higher level and not just some invisible wisp in"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"your brain ... you can create radionic machines that exist, run and are powered from a higher level all completely invisible from this physical world! There are many advantages to this; some being that you are not limited to size, they are invisible to practically everyone on this planet and they can be extremely complicated without having to fork out any money to make the things. And since all levels are existing together, someone in the physical world could pass through a component of an etheric radionic machine and never see or feel a thing! If I pulled you out of your body to the etheric plane or taught you how to access this plane on your own, you would be absolutely stunned at the massive, complicated, huge radionic setup that hovers above, blends with, and goes deep beneath my city. With the flick of my thoughts, I can instantly “call up” other radionic machines in the same place where the other one was or I can hook them all together (another advantage of “internal radionics”). The secret knowledge of “Psionics” is used to help with radionics. Psionics have many different descriptions. For the scope of this book, I will mention that Psionics are ways to amplify and trap energy by using conducive patterns. A simple circle can be considered psionic in nature because the circle emits certain vibrations. A collection of circles creates even more energy and more power. All sorts of designs can do this if you know which designs. The advantage is that you can use these energies for your own goals. The circular patterns below generate a lot of energy and you can \"charge\" you goals in the center. I have a large free pattern at my website that is psionic in nature. Since radionics are tools and machines for your mind/etheric functioning, the possibilities of uses are unlimited to what you can imagine. A list could be endless in radionic applications but here is a list of just some of the things you can do with a radionic machine. After you read this you’ll see why radionics is so secret. This list does not necessarily represent my personal uses for radionics since many are highly immoral and radionics is only one branch of my work. Consider this a generic list of possible uses: - Healing yourself or others of illness, disease, etc. - Removing pests from your home without chemicals. - Removing pests from crops without chemicals. - Teleportation (moving your body around the globe with your thoughts alone). - Levitation (raising physical objects into the air e.g. ... pyramid stones). - Assisting with creative artistic endeavors. - Personal protection. - Psychic warfare if you are under attack. - Removal of alien implants in your body. - Accessing other dimensions and realities. - Gaining secret knowledge. - Reading the mind of others. - Remote viewing (invisible cameras inside places of your choice). - Telepathic communication between individuals. - Wireless, invisible telephonic transmission (say good-bye to high phone bills and great if a disaster hits and all the phone lines are down)."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"- As an FM stereo. - Military applications. - Removal of harmful ELF, electromagnetic frequencies surrounding you. - Broadcasting music or images (my specialty). - Tapping into satellite systems. - Remote viewing beyond the planet to other planets. - Interdimensional warehouse construction. - Making water taste better. - Programming water to have particular qualities to enhance personal development. - Invoking the Light. - Spreading Love more creatively to anyone or anything. - Winning the lottery. - Dematerialization of physical structures. - Breaking down time/space grids around your house for truly multidimensional living. - Accessing higher levels of consciousness and help from higher sources. - Inducing brainstates and altered states. - Programming specific energy patterns into anything. - Transferring the energy of ancient power sources into psionic, radionic devices. The list could go on and on. As you see, the question of morals comes up with many applications that are within your reach with radionics. You will find that any knowledge that comes to you on a higher level has to go through your conscious morals. Most people think that because it is \"higher knowledge\" and awareness, it is always on the positive side. This is not so. Higher knowledge can be used for both good and bad depending upon your choice. You can go to higher levels of awarenesses and dimensions and be a totally 'evil' person. The control structures on this planet have been set up and implemented by negative beings on reside on higher dimensions. A rule to follow is to keep your radionic work centered around Love always, with no exceptions. For example, use your radionic machine for remote viewing to find missing children but don’t use it to watch your favorite actor/actress take a shower. I often notice most after someone reads this book is that they want more information on radionics. The subject quickly becomes tempting. This is our natural tendency to seek power in external devices. Let me state clearly that all of the above applications can be accomplished with the mind alone; for the radionic unit is not actually doing the power or work ... it is your mind. The devices only to help focus the intent. With a highly trained and practiced mind, you need no machine to do this for you. Radionics is a branch of Psionics which uses instruments to analyze and transmit information about and to etheric fields. The main key in radionic work is what is known as the “rate”. The"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"rate is nothing more than a language for translating psychic (mental) impressions into numbers. Everything in existence can be converted into numerical form. This is very complex to get into so I’ll keep it simple. Think back to your high school mathematics about the mathematical symbol called “pi”. If you remember, this pi notation starts with 3.1416 ... and continues to infinity; it never ends. What your math teacher didn’t mention (because they don’t know this) is that everything in existence is contained numerically within the decimal places of “pi”. If you were to convert your name into numbers, it would be found somewhere in pi. If you were to convert your bodily cellular structure into numerical notations, it would be found somewhere in pi. Your car’s license plate could be found in pie. The time and date of your physical death is within pi. The memory and experience or a childhood trauma is within the pi notation somewhere. Feelings, thoughts, emotions, memories, goals, dreams, purposes, whatever, can be converted to a numerical form and found somewhere in pi. The amount of atoms that you have breathed in your life so far can be found in pi. The amount of atoms you will breath for the rest of your life can be found in pi. A radionic visualization can be converted into numbers and be found somewhere in pi. You name it, it is somewhere in pi. That is why pi is such a sacred mathematical notation and the pyramids are all built from this notational formula. When you take a “rate” in radionics, what you are really doing is accessing this pi notation (and other things) on a higher level; your mind is converting your thoughts or etheric structures into a numerical form. You don’t need a calculator to do this. Your mind does it all since you are connected to all things on an unconscious level. There are many different types of rates depending upon your radionic use. If you were to take a “contact” rate of a person for healing purposes, then this rate or series of numbers places you in contact with the person’s etheric body. If you were to take a contact rate for a population of people, then this rate or series of numbers places you in contact with all the people’s etheric bodies. If you were to take a contact rate for a television satellite in orbit around the earth, then this rate or series of numbers places you in contact with the satellite’s etheric body. The contact will be maintained until you break it, something like an open phone line. Contact rates change each time you wish to get in touch with the structure, so there is no point in recording them for future use. If you are trying to make a connection with something, then you would take a contact rate. A rate is done with the dials on the radionic machine. “Analysis” rates are used when you want to analyze something or to take a rate for something that will not change. This rate never changes and can be recorded and used for future use. Other types of rates are pattern rates, broadcast rates, balance rates, light rates, Orgone rates, telepathic rates, just to name a few out of hundreds. Remember that I’m trying to introduce you to something very advanced, repressed and powerful so I am just revealing the basic. The more rates you take with your radionic use, the more intricate of a connection you will make to the etheric energy and more success you will get with your radionic machine. Eventually, when you get very skilled at internal radionics, rates can be taken in the thousands just by your thoughts alone and connections will be made without you having to deal with any numbers. How could you possibly do something like this automatically? It’s simple ... make a radionic machine that will do it for you and tap into it whenever you need to deal with massive amounts of rates (being creative)!"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"A rate can be taken with your radionic machine very simply; almost too simply to believe that it works. It’s done with the use of what is known as a “stick pad”. A pendulum can also be used after some preliminary practice but the stick pad is just as good. This pad can be made from anything flat and smooth. Even though plastic and rubber are not natural, they work extremely well and that’s why the top of a coffee can is sufficient. Copper and gold are the best. The procedure is to pass or rub or stroke your right thumb on the flat surface with just enough pressure to move smoothly but with some friction. When you make the numerical connection your thumb will seem to stick or stop on the pad. A “stick” is hard to describe but you will know it when you feel it; it’s different for each individual. Essentially, the pad seems to “grab” the thumb and stop it. This is the connection. What is really happening is that you are consciously asking your subconscious mind to access the pi notation by giving a sample number to try. As you stroke the pad, your subconscious mind is determining if the number that you have asked to access is the correct number to use. If it is not the correct number, your thumb will continue to pass over the pad as you stroke it. If it is the correct number, your subconscious mind responds by releasing minute amounts of etheric energy from your thumb to “grab” the etheric particles of the pad. You don’t worry about the technicalities of this. Your mind takes care of it all. Just the action of you rubbing the pad slowly and asking your mind if it is the correct number, and knowing that your thumb will stick if it is the correct number, is all you have to do. Your subconscious mind takes care of the rest. You know that when you eat something, the food will get digested in your stomach and pass into your body but you don’t have to think about all the chemical, biological, neurological, physiological responses and mechanisms within your body to make this happen. You just eat and your subconscious mind takes care of the details. If your conscious mind says that is how you will take a rate for the numbers and what will happen if the correct number is found, then leave it up to your subconscious mind to make it happen. Just rub the pad and your thumb will stick for you at the correct moment. Radionics were one of the type of technologies that was used in ancient civilizations, except they were far more advanced than ours. The mind/machines were much different than current radionic machines. Most were powered by natural earth grid energies and earth source energies found in crystals, stones, etc. They were also powered by thought, sacred geometry, sounds and more. Radionics have changed form and use throughout the ages. Medieval times revealed different types as well as some native aboriginal rituals (dancing, art, chanting, etc) were radionic in nature (much different than modern radionics). Radionics is like languages, there are so many different types, variations, branches, levels and uses. I know some people that can move stone with just their voices. I've seen it many times. They have a great knowledge of sound and harmonics but also they use the Earth as a type of radionic machine and dance a certain way which is their \"rate\". Their beats and steps upon the ground give them the \"numbers\" to make the connection between their mind, voices and their intent. Their movement upon the ground reflects sacred geometry enabling them to generate even more power. This stuff can get very heavy duty and that is why it is rarely known and why you probably won't even believe this chapter. If all this seems pretty far fetched, that's OK. This is nature's way of ensuring only certain people get this knowledge. But despite the rarity of this knowledge, you will be surprised at just how many people are involved in radionic research. I myself am a radionic researcher and my applications of my radionic technology are very vast."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"I am working on the broadcast of sounds, tones, harmonics and frequencies worldwide without using any electronics. This might seem strange but wouldn't it be neat if your city was engulfed with music? Music that seemed to come from nowhere ... music that penetrated all physical structure ... music that healed and got rid of disease, fear and lower awareness levels. My people are working on this right now worldwide. Imagine being awaken in the middle of the night to amazing music that filled the skies and then days later the people in your city began physical and mental healing processes. Imagine 3rd world countries being engulfed with music and then days later, the Earth would begin to give food and growth in vegetation. Imagine images being \"broadcast\" into television sets all over the country that interrupted all channels and revealed the truth about things (via radionic live cameras into the past). Wacko stuff eh? Speaking of radionic cameras, I have a full webpage devoted to Dr. Ruth Drown’s radionic camera of the 1950’s. Well it's all possible if you know how with radionics and sacred geometry. All this won't sound so strange when you hear music rain down from the skies in your city. When the timing is right and the balance is centered ... it will happen and it will start to bring people into new awarenesses and a new world in a positive way as opposed to the negative fearful ways (doomsday, Armageddon, aliens coming to get you, etc). So what's the deal with sacred geometry? I've mentioned it enough times and I thought that it would be nice to give you a little hint of it (I stress little). Yeah, you could use radionics for mind power seduction but I've included this chapter to spark your awareness to new levels ... to give you a little taste of there's-more-out-there-than-you-know. When your mind is raised to new levels, your thoughts and use of your thoughts gain more power. Sacred geometry is the language of everything. You probably remember learning about geometry in school (or are currently learning). 'Sacred' geometry is a little different than the stuff they teach you in school. This type of geometry has to do with shapes and mathematics but more on a 'cosmic' level. The prominent aspect of sacred geometry is that everything (EVERYTHING) is a by-product of geometry and everything (EVERYTHING) is connected by geometry. Geometry can be described mathematically (this is not hidden) so there is mathematics (sacred mathematics) in all things ... from the pyramids to your eye sight. Geometry can be found in everything in the universe and understanding of sacred geometry can give you the knowledge of all the universe. Obviously this can take books and books to begin to describe so this knowledge that you'll find here is just a slight taste. When you understand the geometry in everything, you can begin to understand how life works and how we all fit together in the cosmos. Everything is created in a certain geometric way and has geometric properties ... from DNA, to bodily cells, to trees, to dimensions, to language, to viruses, to music, to computers, to chemicals, to atoms. Here are the basic geometric shapes. They are often called the Platonic Solids. These are the components of so many things in the universe, from the energy fields around the planet to the energy fields around your body. They can even describe your cellular structure and your DNA if you know how to put them together. They even show exactly how the universe was created if you know how to understand them. The most important image of sacred geometry is the Flower of Life because within it contains all of creation. Everything is created using this geometric pattern; everything from music, to"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"language, to nature. This will not be readily seen to you if you have never seen or studied sacred geometry. Remember that sacred geometry is not just nice images on paper. These are motions and formations in multiple dimensions. For example, the Flower of Life is made up of a collection of spheres that are interlocked. When they move in a certain way they can change form and create what is called a Tube Torus. This is the shape of our universe (in 3d of course depicted in a 2d way on paper). There is so much contained in this image that would take a book to really describe. One of the things that I find most interesting is that all alphabets of all languages can be found in this image (see Dan Winter’s work). It's all a matter of how you view it and what you view. If you picked a certain section of this tube and rotated it around, you could clearly see each letter of the English alphabet or even the Hebrew alphabet. When you convert the Bible in it's original Hebrew text into this image, the Bible can literally take shape in sacred geometry. This Tube Torus also shows the gravitational force of the magnetic components of this planet. Even all the ancient sites are laid out on one of the line spirals (called the Fibonacci spiral). This is a mathematical spiral that comes from a certain relationship of numbers depicting organic growth. If you study the layout and placement of all the ancient temples and structures, they all lay on this Fibonacci spiral and stem from one particular point in Egypt. The Fibonacci spiral can be seen all throughout nature (rams horn, nautilus shell, sunflower double spiral) and is the connection between music and the world around us if you study it. These ‘symbols’ occur everywhere in the universe. You cannot understand why all this has been hidden from you because full knowledge of this is can make you a very powerful and enlightened human. The Earth has energy fields surrounding it called grids. There are many different types of grids around the planet and they have many different geometric shape. Ancient people knew about these grids lines or ley lines as sometimes called. This is a free source of natural power if you can tap into the grids. Nikola Tesla (the inventor of the radio) knew all about this stuff and designed some amazing things (most of which you will never read about). Once of his biggest accomplishments that wasn't hidden from the public was his ability to broadcast electricity anywhere on the planet. With 8 special 'generators' (Tesla Coils) placed in certain positions on the planet ... he could tap into these grid energies and the result would be complete electrical power for the entire world. It's interesting that these 'towers' would have to be placed at certain grid points coinciding with sacred geometric energy points. He knew something big but little became of this invention (yet!). Nikola did leave a big impression on the world though. Everytime you plug something into your 60Hz outlet in the wall, you are using his invention (AC current). A little bit of Tesla is everywhere ... in every home and every business. He was always one of my idols since childhood because of his secret technology that I am mastering and because he was able to see every invention in his mind perfectly even before he put it on paper. That's why he got it right the very first time when manufacturing a prototype. He was a genius at visualization, and he applied this for the good of all with his inventions. However the best of his work has been carefully hidden from the public. So just how important is this information? Well sacred geometry can give you extraordinary abilities and can even give you the vehicle for moving into other dimensions! Around your body is an energy field that consists of two interlocking tetrahedrons. This image on a flat scale is also known as the Star of David (however the true knowledge of this image is"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"still pretty much secret). On a full 3 dimensional scale, this image is a field of energy in the shape of two interlocking tetrahedrons called a Merkaba or Merkabah. You have this field around you however it's probably not activated (only about 3,000 people on this planet have a full active Merkaba fields). You can activate it though with very hidden techniques. This energy field is your own 'vehicle' for moving into higher dimensions. Without giving away the secret, what you do is you get this field spinning around you at a certain ration (Fibonacci ratio). When it hits a certain speed (0.9 speed of light), it bulges out like a disk and thus becomes your own consciousness driven vehicle for interdimensional travel! UFOs are the same thing except they are created with electronics (external Merkaba). The one I described above is an \"internal Merkaba\" and does not use electronics but rather certain breathing techniques, certain visualization techniques and a Love for all life everywhere. When you get this field spinning, it bulges out to 55 feet. This Merkabah field is connected to your energy/chakra points. If you look at any yogic or eastern chakra chart, you will see the geometry of the double tetrahedron located at the 'Heart' Chakra. I did not go into full detail here about the usage and methods of radionics. If you are interested in this field, then I can assume that it is already pulling on you use it for mind power seduction. If you do feel pulled, then something within you is seeking to find answers using outside technologies. Everything you need for advanced mental powers is inside you. If you give up your power to outside technologies (even alternative ones), then your mind will be less developed and you will be needing to rely on these devices. This is not a paradigm to move towards as it is very important to break out of the world mind-set that technologies are necessary. The paradigm you want to seek towards is the paradigm of complete internal technology. But when you are sufficiently developed with your inner skills, then I have lots of information and tools available at my website for you to learn from and use."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Neurological Triggers These techniques go back hundreds of years and can give you very sharp & clear inner vision. All types of information is stored in your brain and these techniques will bring this information instantly into your mind. Give them plenty of practice and you will see what I mean. The pictures in your mind have to be very clear and powerful in order for your mind power to be effective. The clearer the picture, the easier it will be for you to feel as if you are actually experiencing your visualized goal. This first method will enhance your general clarity of your inner eye. Go outside during the day when the sun is shining brightly. With your eyes closed, look directly at the sun. Ever heard of \"full spectrum lights\"? You can use these if you don’t live in a sunny place. Stare at the sun with your eyes closed for about 15 - 30 seconds. With you eyes still closed and looking at the sun, massage your eyes for the same amount of time (15 - 30 seconds). This will produce lots of colors within your sight. Try to keep the colors focused in your mind and awareness as the colors appear. As you hold these colors in your mind and you can “see” them with your eyes closed, move your head away and back towards the sun a few times. Do this movement for about half a minute. Pause for a little and repeat the entire procedure a few times. Be careful not to rub your eyes too much; just a gentle massage. If you can hold the colors in your mind for more than 30 seconds, then continue to do so. The key is not to try and see the colors for a long time. The key is clarity in retaining what colors you see and the movement to and away from the sun. What you are doing is stimulating the cones of your eyes which effects the direct interaction of information going to your brain - thus giving you a more clearer visualization ability. When I was a young boy, I remember rubbing my eyes (usually before bed). If it was dark in my room, rubbing my eyes for about 90 seconds cause me to see all sorts of colors and colored dots that looked liked stars in the sky (at least I used to pretend these little dots were stars). If I kept my eyes closed for a moment after my rubbing, I tried to counts the clumps or see clearly the individual dots of colors. Even though I think I rubbed my eyes too long (since they got sore), little did I know that I was improving my powers of visualization in an unplanned way. This, and the methods to follow, might seem very basic but you should not underestimate the power that they have. You just need to work with them to see for yourself. 1) This is an exercise for the lens of your eyes, which will keep them flexible and will in turn enhance your powers of visualization. Start by looking at a book placed at a distance of 6 inches away from you. Then look and focus on something far away (about 6 feet). If you wear glasses, don't use them for these exercises. Keep this focusing up back and forth without straining. This will give you great strength in the lenses of your eyes which will make it better to visualize. Remember, when you visualize you are still using your eyes (just"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"in a different way) combined with your imagination. 2) Place something that you can read on a wall at the same height as your eyes. This can be a page of newspaper or magazine or whatever. Stand as close as you need to in order to read the text. Next, step back a little and try to read the text. Practice this everyday going just a tad farther back each time. You only need to practice about a few minutes a day and remember with all these exercises ... DO NOT STRAIN YOUR EYES. You must remain relaxed. 3) In this exercise you place a book as close to your face as possible but you can still be able to read it. Read for a few seconds. Practice daily for a few minutes. The eye positions given now will open up hidden information in your brain as well as strengthen your memory, focus and learning capacity. These are natural neurological triggers that stimulate certain parts of your brain's electrical impulses which can then create specific results. 1) To recall visual memories, look straight ahead and then up to the left. Hold your eyes here for 25 seconds. This process forces your mind to recall visual memories when you are wanting to remember them. It will also strengthen your visual memory (visualization). 2) To access hearing or sound memory you need to look down and to the left. You must do this when you are visualizing something that has sound. Look down and to the left in your visualizing and your inner hearing will be more developed. This can be important because adding sound to your visualizing can increase your influence. If you are in that Alpha place of yours, maybe visualize a CD player at the bottom left corner of your sight. Look to that location in your visualizing and turn on the CD. Listening to music while you do Alpha work can bring total clarity in your visualizing over time. If your mind starts to tune into the physical music rather than the music in your visualizing, just do this trigger. 3) To recall or enhance your touch memory or touch visualizing, practice looking down to the right. Practice these triggers in your daily life while you remember the appropriate memory (touch). When you visualize, do these triggers in your mind's eye and enhance the appropriate sensation. 4) Looking up to the right is a very important trigger. While visualizing, this trigger can access new visual formations. For example, when you have created your imaginary Alpha room for seduction, lock it into this trigger by looking up to the right and telling yourself that your brain has now made a trigger connection with your Alpha place. Over time, it will become easier to access this Alpha scenario when you start to visualize and look up to the right to bring this place into your imagination. Practice in the day for 1 minute looking up to the right and create new visual images. 5) Taste and smell can be accessed by looking straight down. 6) To access new sound forms, look straight and to the right. If you practice this and use it in your visualizing, you will open yourself up to all sorts of new sounds. 7) To recall auditory memory, look straight and to the left."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The key is this ... after you practice these exercises and recall the appropriate trigger (taste, touch, etc), do all the movements in the order shown for about 20 seconds each. This will open up your \"third eye\" and it will make your visualization penetrate the deep depths of your mind (the subconscious). This whole procedure can take only 5 minutes but will greatly enhance your visualization skill and creativity. You can do this 'going around the clock' procedure before you start your visualizing. These brain triggers might seem like a mystery to you. They have also been called anchors or links. They are just physical movements or stimulus that creates a link to a specific psychological process, feeling or experience. Have you ever listened to a song that you haven't heard in years and when you listen to the song you can remember the time in your life when that song was prominent. You might not remember a specific moment but the song might be linked with a \"great summer\" or an old lover. Even listening to a song years later still brings up the old memories or feelings you felt then. This is just a trigger that has been made between the physical hearing of a song to a particular time in your past. If you've never experienced this then you are probably not old enough yet. The most prominent triggers of this sort are linked to your high school years since this is the flowering of emotional awareness combined with listen to a lot of music (as most youth do). My first experience with this type of triggering was when I was a young boy. I used to play in a youth military band and for one summer we traveled all around southern Ontario in Canada, performing in parades and events. One time we were played in a 'old-age' retirement home for WWI and WWII veterans. We were to walk (or march) through this home where all the bed- ridden men were sitting in their wheel chairs or hospital beds. As about 25 of us young boys and girls played (accompanied with about 10 drummers), the Scottish war songs filled the air in this retirement home. Usually when we played in front of people, the people were always smiling (whether enjoying the music or laughing at us) or tapping their feet or clapping or whatever. But at this place, I noticed something that shocked me and my awareness ... As we marched through the building, most of the elderly men were in tears. Not just crying with a gentle sob but rather letting out all emotions with mouths hanging wide open and tears flowing like crazy. I couldn't hear their cries because the music was very loud, yet I realized at that moment what was happening. Our music was triggering all memories or feelings that these men had during their fighting days. Especially since most of these veterans were in regiments or militia units that had experience when pipe bands and brass bands use to literally play in the field along side the soldiers. It was at that moment that I realized the power of what the music that I was playing could do on people. The point is that music can create a great trigger within people but music is not the only trigger. If you have a bad experience while in a high place ('height' not drug) you will associate those negative feelings with a high elevation and thus - fear of heights. The same sort of trigger has been created with all sorts of things in people's lives whether fearing the boogie man under the bed to a dislike of a particular food that gave you a bad experience. Sexual triggers are also very powerful and the most common triggers occur when looking a photograph and you remember or feel a past event. You can use triggers to your advantage by creating your own neurological links with certain experiences or feelings.

The effect won't happen right away but if you keep up with the trigger for a few weeks or months, all you have to do is to do the exact same squeeze and the same confident feelings will come up. When you are in the height of your visualizing seduction scenario, maybe touch a certain two fingers together at this moment. If you keep this up each time, when you around the person you can do this trigger that you have created and your mind will emit all those vibrations and feelings that you were experiencing at the moment you programmed them into your trigger. Even your basic Alpha state can be triggered to a discrete connection you make with your fingers, hands, ear lobes, or whatever. If you apply the exact same trigger every time you are in an Alpha state, then it won't be long when you can induce these Alpha waves just by applying the trigger. This is great if you are in public places and you wish to induce Alpha brainwaves when you are active. You can also create triggers with physical objects. You just link them with your experience over and over and soon you can just apply the trigger to get into that experience. Triggers are only limited to your creativity. Here's one creative trigger. While you are visualizing your psychic touching, visualize yourself reaching up to the shoulder of the person you are working on. Place your hand on their shoulder gently for a quick second and then go back to your sexual visualizing. If you repeat this for a few weeks in your visualizing, wait till the person is in front of you and then quickly place your real hand in the exact same quick way on their shoulder (as you did in your visualizing). You will be activating a double trigger here ... your mental seduction Alpha influence and the person will quickly become turned on because you have induced this trigger to be associated with an erotic experience. You can touch their shoulder quickly in an nonintruding way if it's a quick 'reassurance' type of touch or if you want to pull up your sock or something and you need someone to lean on for a second. It's up to you to get creative with the art of triggering and up to you to figure out creative discrete ways to implement these. Just make sure that your trigger is the exact same when you are programming it and then applying it. I'd love to hear of your creative uses for triggers as you develop skill at this.

The hardest part of Mind Power Seduction is getting off one's butt and applying the techniques. :) We are all prone to laziness and procrastination. But if you are serious about developing this unique and powerful skill... you must practice, practice and practice. That is how you will become a master at it. At the end of the Mind Power Seduction Manual, I offered some things to remember. Below are some additional pointers and good things to keep in mind. § When the mental image is complete, it can be superimposed upon reality. Your mind can then manipulate the image and thus manipulate the reality. § When reality becomes private for you, you are outside of the perceptual fields of any other lifeform whose sensory endowments are similar to your own. Then you have the opportunity for meditation, exempt from the theoretical bondage of sharing another's perceptual field. § Within this world of polarity, choice and free will, you have an opportunity to realize your full potential to become a 'cosmic creator'. § As we all near the close of a great planetary cycle, more than ever, it becomes increasingly important that your beliefs not be limited by what you have been taught via your orthodox education. You have to learn trust yourself, your feelings and the process of your life. § Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is for you § Persistence is the hard work you do after you've finished doing the hard work you already did § There are those who see an opportunity and then there are those who SEIZE an opportunity! § Look at these worlds spinning out of nothingness. That is within your power § Motivation is when your dreams put on work clothes."}]
