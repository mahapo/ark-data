In this book I hope you will discover the amazing and wondrous mind that you have. I hope you will experience aspects of yourself that you had not explored up until now. An ultimately I hope for you to experience yourself as a deserving a worthy person who seeks out pleasure and joy, not only sexually but in every moment of every day. Join me... in an adventure of your mind. The use of hypnosis for seduction is an art. The goal of having better sex is very exciting and enticing for several reasons. If we can tap into our mind’s ability to find greater levels of arousal, and to create those states on command we can experience more of who we are. To connect with someone and discover the chemistry that stirs us deeply to a state of desire... is one of our deepest, most powerful drives. Now, you will discover what puts us in a state of rapport, trust, and desire and sparks what we call chemistry. There are many books written about the use of hypnosis for seduction by men, for men, that tell you how to pick up and seduce women. And while they have lots of good ideas, they are"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"not written by women, and they don’t have it from the inside source on what really makes a woman feel wanted. Much of the speed seduction that is available ends up making a man feel foolish and turning women away. The speed seduction teachers have the right techniques and some are brilliant. But, since it is results that count, and the results are judged by the women on the receiving end, a more refined approach is in order. I received an e-mail from a man who had obviously taken a Neuro Linguistic Programming course on seduction. His words were straight out of a seduction technique book. I just had to shake my head and wonder what woman would become weak with desire for these words. My first reaction was that he had something wrong with him, as he seemed so out of touch with reality. These words had no heart, no feelings being expressed and the feeling I was left with was to stay away. Even though there may have been a good man under it all, those canned words closed a door. Many, if not most men, think that a woman wants what they want. We think that others, male or female, will respond to the same things that make us fill with desire, go wild with passion and feel connected. Much of the training in this book will help you to detect what it is that others want. The audio tapes/CD’s will help you to unconsciously get inside of their reality and find out what they want. Once you give your subconscious mind permission to enter another’s reality, you give yourself permission to learn and experience what it is that makes them tick. Or tock. You already have hypnotic powers. If you can speak (and in some cases you don’t even need to do that to induce trance) you can create a state of trance. Much of the art of hypnotism has to do with the trances we live in day to day. Since we go in and out of trance throughout the day, it is a matter of practice to identify these trance states and use them for the greater good. Most people can become very entrancing with practice. It is a skill that can be learned and, as with any skill it r equires practice. Creating trance is not only in the words you say, but the way you say it, and it is not only the way you say it but the meaning and intention behind it. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"I believe that women have the ability to subconsciously read another person’s intentions. It may be that we are highly intuitive, or it might be that we can pick up imperceptible cues from a man that register in our subconscious mind and tell us if he is sincere or not. Never underestimate the ability of the mind to unconsciously pick up and lock onto information that you did not know you are sending! And this unconscious information is what creates a trance or sends us running the other way. The information that you are sending through subtle cues and language patterns is perceived on a subconscious level and creates a state in a person. The words you choose may touch a very special place in her that creates deep desire, a desire to be closer to you than she has ever wanted to be with any man. A feeling that is created in her that she would do anything for you... anything. Have you ever had that feeling about a woman? Do you know that the reasons that you have desire for a woman have virtually nothing in common with the reasons that she is going to want to get close to you? What makes you want a woman, is not necessarily what makes her want you. This first part of this training is going to be an understanding of what a woman or a man really wants. You will learn the art of rapport. Instant, magical rapport. Good rapport will open doors for you not only in relationships, but also in work, sales, and persuading others. Once you have mastered rapport, I can teach you how to create a trance that will help you tap into what a man or woman really “wants” and what will touch him or her very deeply. All this without so much as a touch. Once your partner feels that connection with you, and you have opened her subconscious mind, you can then suggest how wonderful it will be to give her what you have always dreamed of. The second part of the training will focus on what to do with the erotic mind once you have rapport and trust. I will teach you how to become a hypnotist, how to create powerful trance states and"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"even... drum roll... how to induce a hypnotic orgasm. Now I have your attention, yes? Now, first you need to know some things about yourself and about what your goals are. And I think you should know some things about me. I will go first. I have written the first part of this book primarily aimed at helping men creating rapport with women. All of this applies to women creating rapport with men as well, however, women typically create powerful rapport and state of desire with men.... without much training. So, while it is intended for both sexes, it is just that men need it more. Way more. Trust me. Another thing about me. I am a woman who loves romance, passion and sex. I love passion and I think it is the greatest gift that this universe will ever give us. I believe that our bodies were made to want and desire sex above and beyond all our other needs. I think that all the parts of our bodies are in some way, sex organs, and are designed to respond to pleasure. This is nature in its finest form. I also think that a lot of what life teaches us leaves us ashamed of our bodies and our sexuality. Especially for women. For you to create a safe, and pleasurable state for a woman to experience herself as sensual and beautiful is the greatest gift you can give her. That is hypnotic. That is a trance that she will come back for again and again. This is what we desire above everything else, and I imagine that what you want to create is desire. Once you have that you can have anything. This probably applies to most women. What we really want from sex is the desire and passion and the feeling we get when we really believe we are special, cared for and protected. You will find that in a woman, no matter how much she loves sex, she will not be yours, she will not truly give herself to you unless you find out what it is that really makes her feel special, that touches her in that special place.

About you: (go ahead, actually answer these) Why do you want to learn hypnosis? What is your ultimate outcome, or goal, in hypnosis? What do you want to create with a trance, in a woman? Are you interested in mind control or in persuasion? (Big difference, think about it) What kind of man/woman are you? (Be honest) are you sincere, arrogant, dishonest, likable, pleasant, hard to get to know, easy to be around, intimate, distant.... How do you see yourself?

And here, in this book, none of that is going to be explored. Not that it would not be a worthy pursuit, and granted there a lot of books that will explore the cutting edge of our potential. However, we are not going to do that here. While this book will explore many facets of the human mind, I will try to avoid fascinating you with details of the miracles, the magic, and the magnificence of the mind, and stay focused on one thing. Pleasure. Pure pleasure. Physically, emotionally and for those so inclined, spiritually. One of the most fascinating things about the human brain is the ability it has to create pleasure. In my private"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"practice, I have watched words transform deep emotional pain into pleasure. I have spent thousands of hours watching people lift themselves out of darkness and into the light. And when that happens there a wonderful transformation that happens in many areas of their life. Not the least of which is sexual. Imagine what might happen if you could freely express your sensuality... if you could release your inhibitions and be a seductress, or a powerfully seductive man. Imagine what might happen if you could let go of your preconditioned ideas about sex, your guilt from childhood and experience sex without hang-ups. I think this possibility exists in all of us. Not just in some. But in every one of us lies a potential to be fully alive, sensual and tantalizing. The only missing ingredient is permission. When you see people hypnotized on stage, they seem to have a freedom, an air about them that they never had before. But, in truth, they did have it before they ever set foot on stage. They already had the ability to sing or entertain, or to become a stripper! The only thing that the hypnosis added was permission. I remember a time when I had permission. I this case it was permission to be sensual. It was in one of those human potential groups and all of the women participating had to do this sensual dance and entice the men into feeling desirous of them. The magic was in the experience of giving ourselves permission to be sensual, to experience a gift that lies in each and every one of us, without shame, without reservation and without any threat of consequences. We danced and undulated as the men looked on and our most sensual part of ourselves took over. For most of us it was a life changing experience. And you can imagine, that for me, the daughter of a Southern Baptist minister, (yup, I’m the preacher’s daughter) how permission could alter my reality. As it turned out, my preacher dad grew up to be a sex therapist and now helps people with sexual problems that are a result of their religious beliefs. And as for me.... well, I get to write about it. I guess one of the big transformations was to go from being the daughter of a man who was EXTREMELY uncomfortable with me attending so much as a dance lesson. (dancing = sin) And then to"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"hear him talk about what he learned in school today, as he was 60 years old and getting his doctorate in Human Sexuality.... well it certainly gave my inner child a nudge. And it nudged me all the way into a discovery of our subconscious mind’s perception of our sexual selves. My conclusion, as a result of being a therapist, is that we are built, from head to toe, in mind and body to want and desire sex. There is no getting around it, no denying it, we are here to procreate. Every organ in our body is a sex organ. Our physical body is created to desire sex. When the sexual desire is turned on there is little that will stand in the way, and little that will tu rn it off. It is the one thing that we all share no matter what culture, what language, what training or upbringing we have. We can all experience our most powerful drive in the same way. I guess it’s a good thing we also come with a conscience. My experience with hypnosis has taught me that there is a greater capacity for joy in our sexual selves than most of us realize. Hypnosis is the tool that gives you access to the most powerful, most erotic and most intriguing sex organ in our bodies... our brain. Now maybe you thought that your genitals were your sex organs. Boy, were you wrong. The mind’s the thing. If you are familiar with hypnosis and familiar with sex, you will have a question on your mind that I have been asked a million times. “Can a person really have an orgasm just by being hypnotized?” It happened on the radio, as a hypnotist on Howard Stern’s show did it. Then again as a hypnotist on the Tom Leykis show did just that. And then I found a video from a well known hypnosis school that shows a woman hypnotized into having an orgasm with no physical contact. If you consider that our subconscious minds can create an orgasm while we sleep, with no contact, then you can imagine that it could be possible during our waking time if we can just find the way to access that state in the subconscious mind. Hypnosis is the vehicle that allows you to access the power of the subconscious mind."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"It can help you to change your beliefs, change your perceptions, and change your reality. And when it comes to sex, many of us would like to change our reality. And have some really great, mind bending sex.

This book will create the canvas for you to paint your desired reality and step into your new perceptions. This book is not going to change the world. But it might just rock yours! "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 2 What is hypnosis? “In my sex fantasy, nobody ever loves me for my mind.” -Nora Ephron Hypnosis is actually not sleep at all. It is simply a relaxed, focused state of concentration. You do it almost every day. Every time you daydream, or visualize an event in the past or future, that's hypnosis. Everyone can experience a state of hypnosis and new research shows that the results are the same regardless of the depth of trance. Sometimes just closing your eyes and taking a deep breath is enough to put yourself into a receptive state. Hypnotherapy is much more than just hypnosis, in that it looks for the deep seated causes of problems and solutions and answers within your own mind. With Hypnotherapy, your subconscious creates new and more powerful ways to solve problems, overcome fears and limitations, and make lasting changes in your life. Hypnosis is a state of mind that few can agree on. It is most difficult to define, impossible to find, and most hypnotized subjects will emerge saying that they don’t think they were hypnotized! There is a deep level of hypnosis called Somnambulism. In this state there is a dramatic slowing of the breathing, heart rate and skin color becomes pale. The subject however is not asleep. This"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"state is very distinctly different that sleep, in that your subject is very suggestible. Subjects in a state of somnambulism often have amnesia for the suggestions that were given. In other words, upon opening their eyes they will not remember anything that transpired during the session. Neuro Linguistic Programming is a technology that utilizes the language of the brain. Most NLP processes are relatively simple and yet are able to create profound change in the way the brain processes information. NLP is also a great way to make changes in the way we motivate ourselves, create desirable outcomes, and release the past. Understanding the language of the brain can help us to become powerful persuaders, and create desirable outcomes in business, personal and romantic relationships. Much of my work combines the cutting edge knowledge of Neuro Linguistic Programming and deep trance states to effect change. A growing offshoot of Neuro Linguistic Programming is NLS, which stands for Neuro Linguistic Seduction. Some of what you will learn in part one of this book is the gleaned from this concept. There are words and patterns that seduce and create attachment. There is a rapidly growing consciousness that works toward mastering the use of NLS to simply figure out how to get a date and get laid once in a while. Fascinating actually. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 3 The Hypnotic Mind “Men aren’t attracted to me by my mind, they’re attracted by what I don’t mind.” -Gypsy Rose Lee Everyone can be hypnotized. Not everyone is suggestible, however. Some people will resist suggestion under hypnosis because they think it would mean they are weak minded, or are being controlled. It is important to remember that a hypnotized person would probably not do anything under hypnosis that they would not do ordinarily. In other words, they will not violate their beliefs or values just because they are hypnotized. There is a very fine line here, and one, which is a subject of much debate among hypnotists. Can a person be made to do something against their will? Or maybe the more appropriate question....Can I make you dance naked on the table? Here’s how it works. You are someone who has never danced naked on a table. You feel it is wrong. I suggest to you in trance that you will do just that and you refuse. End of trust and end of trance. However, what if your deepest desire is to feel erotic and desired and you have a secret dream to just once, find out what it is like to do an erotic dance. I could suggest that, “in a moment you are"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"going to feel something that you have always wanted to feel, to experience yourself as more beautiful and desirable than you have ever felt. A deep part of you that longs for this feeling is listening to me now, and hears these words. No harm can come to you and you will feel that this is the most natural thing to do.” Now, I have a shot at it. Because now, I may have found a way to make the suggestion congruent with your values. If I did this, I would be running a great risk, because it would potentially destroy the trust that is needed for hypnosis. If you had agreed to dance naked on the table before the trance, then maybe. And make sure it is a sturdy table. When you hypnotize someone, if you violate that trust, you may never get it back. So, no naked table dancing... unless they beg for it. Persuasion Persuasion is an art. The best communicators have mastered persuasion and employ the power of words. Expert persuaders use hypnosis and suggestion in an awake state. We are often in trance during waking hours. We are very suggestible while in waking trance and our mind can become open and receptive to suggestion based on the words that are used. If you craft your words to create a state in the subconscious mind, and that state creates willingness to move toward a desired outcome, you are a master persuader. ( Much more about this later) Waking trance We live much of our lives in trance. We slip in and out of trance many times during the day, while driving, reading, and daydreaming. And during that time, the subconscious becomes more open and receptive. A person who is looking to create a state in another person will watch for signs that the person is going into trance during conversation. Breathing slows, eyes dilate, the gaze becomes slightly unfocused, shoulders may drop and the face muscles become relaxed."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" During this time of trance, we are suggestible. This is the most valuable learning that you may get from this book. Identify a waking trance in someone and use your power of persuasion with well crafted words, to create a desired outcome. If you have done your homework, and know what the other person wants, you can tap into their dreams and desires. Sad to say... con men are masters at this. They have the ability to find out what we really want, and fulfill our needs with a vision that matches our internal order. When a con man can identify our most basic needs and appeal to us from the language of our desire, we may see him with eyes of trust. This is not to say that master persuaders are con men. The best persuader comes from integrity and good intention. There is a common value in the con man, and the sincere and integrous man. They both understand your desires and dreams. They know how to find your values and speak to you from there. Conditioned responses A conditioned response is a command that states you will do, feel, hear or see something when the trigger is there. For instance, every time you feel my hand touch your skin you will relax deeper. Every time my hand touches your body, that part of your body will begin to tingle and get warm. That is an example of a conditioned response. During the training in this book, you will create many conditioned responses, some of them post-hypnotic. A post hypnotic suggestion is a conditioned response that affects you after the trance. For instance: Every time you see the color red, you will feel warm. If you see it consciously or subconsciously, your body will begin to get warmer, and you will feel a deep sensation of desire building within you. This creates a response that is conditioned upon you feeling a specific way when the condition is there. In the second part of this book, there are many suggestions for creating conditioned responses and ways to phrase your commands."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 4 Anchoring A student undergoing a word-association test was asked why a snowstorm put him in mind of sex. He replied frankly: “Because everything does.” -Honor Tracy Remember back to a time when you heard a song in High School, and maybe that song was playing when you were with a girl or boy you liked...maybe the first time you kissed... and now when you hear that song you feel just like you did then. Many of us experience these anchors. That warm, fuzzy feeling growing in you, taking you back to the state you were in at that time, is the result of an anchor. Sounds, smells, words and touch can be powerful anchors. Most anchors are set unintentionally. When we are in a highly emotional state, feeling loved, feeling fear or intense emotion, an anchor can be set very effectively. Every time that anchor is triggered, for instance we smell a certain perfume, hear that old song, or see an object, our mind re-creates the state we were in at the time. Some anchors are set unintentionally and can cause us great problems. Many phobic responses and fears are the result of an anchor that is stimulating the fear again. If you were in a car accident as a child, and it happened on a bridge, you might be extremely uncomfortable every time you go over a bridge now. You probably won’t know why you have a panicked feeling on bridges and overpasses since the response is taking place on a subconscious level. But you will get a heart pounding, eye opening reaction to the bridge."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" You can anchor a response in someone without his or her knowledge or permission. Covert anchoring can be done intentionally or unintentionally. If your girlfriend is upset and you touch her on the shoulder, you may be anchoring this negative state. If this is the only time you touch her or hold her in that way, you might be unintentionally anchoring that negative response. If you previously had set an anchor for a positive emotional state, you could now use this touch to intentionally shift her emotions to elicit a positive state. Or to elicit an on the spot orgasm. Stay tuned, more about this later. Many public speakers use anchors to increase the effectiveness of their message. A speaker will stand in a specific spot while speaking about positive future events, describing stories about how people feel and react in a positive way. That spot may anchor feelings of hope and dreams coming true. The speaker will keep coming back to that spot every time he wants to install a positive future feeling. When that spot is anchored, the speaker will then suggest you sign up for the next training, or buy the book. When the speaker steps into that spot your feelings of hope, dreams coming true, and excitement about the future are triggered. At that moment all you know is that owning that book or attending that training makes you feel great! Many sales people are learning about covert anchoring to create a state of desire that will help them close the sale. The sales person can anchor positive states in you with the position of their body, or a unique movement of an arm or touch of their face. Then when they need a positive emotional response from you, boom, they fire the anchor and ask the question. “How will it feel for you when you are able to double your business with our advertising program?” Well, I guess it feels good says the subconscious mind. The answer is, “Where do I sign!” If you have ever seen Anthony Robbins do a training, you may not have noticed the unusual movements he makes. If you were looking for them you would be as amazed as I am at the blatant anchoring he does. As he tells you a story and he elicits a feeling of hope, or fun or excitement, he slaps his hand against his arm"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"hard. You don’t realize why he is doing that, it is dismissed by the conscious mind. If you know what you’re looking for and watch closely you begin to notice how powerful of an anchor it is. He re- anchors it, slaps it hard, and when he is ready to elicit that feeling, boom. He slaps his arm hard, and you feel exactly the way he wants you to feel! Now for a little sexual desire anchoring. This is where it gets fun. Let’s say you are in an intimate conversation with a woman and you ask her about a time when she felt very loved, or a time when she felt completely relaxed. As she tells you, and as she re- creates that state, you notice the response as she is feeling it now, and BOOM you set an anchor. An anchor can be a touch- you could touch her shoulder, her hand or finger, or you could anchor it with a touch on your own body. You could touch your chin, ear or just place your fingers together in an unusual way. This anchor needs to be a unique movement, a touch or movement that is not typical. As a hypnotist, I use an anchor that is a touch on the shoulder. I place my hand on the shoulder muscle and give a little squeeze on the muscle. If I re- enforce the anchor several times, the next time I am with that person I can place my hand on their shoulder, give a little squeeze and your subconscious mind will do the rest! Think about a few unique anchors you can use with lovers, bosses, friends, and your children. Use them repetitively when you are in good rapport, and anchor those feelings that you want to anchor. Create an anchor for a child when you are proud of him. A touch on the shoulder or neck that is unique, can be re- anchored every time the child is feeling proud of himself. Then when your child is feeling down and needs a boost in her state, use the anchor and say, “I’m proud!” "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Stacking Anchors and Sexual Response You can create a word as an anchor, such as NICE, WONDERFUL, EXQUISITE, and say it while you are using the kinesthetic anchor. Now, you are stacking anchors. Adding an auditory anchor to a kinesthetic anchor deepens the experience. So, in conversation when you have accessed a state in a person’s mind, you will want to anchor it. When you have effectively anchored a state, you can re-create that state by firing the anchor and using the word that triggers the auditory anchor. The nice thing about anchors is every time you re-anchor an experience it will build and strengthen the effect of the anchor. Now, let’s say you want to make you partner feel loved, or feel desire for you, the moment she sees you. You fire your anchors covertly and continue with your conversation, or say nothing at all and allow your anchors to create an intense state of desire. Sexual anchoring is powerful, especially for women. Well, ok, for men, too. But you have to admit, it doesn’t take much to get you guys into a state of desire. Imagine if we built all these anchors and then started using them... you guys would be flat out uncontrollable. If you choose a word or a touch during a moment of intense sexual desire, especially during a moment of orgasm, and then fire that anchor later during normal conversation, you will recreate that state of desire. During sexual desire and especially during orgasm the mind is very open and receptive to suggestion. During that moment, you can place a kinesthetic (physical) anchor. This kinesthetic anchor needs to be something that you could easily use later, while in conversation or in public. It could be a squeeze of the shoulder, a stroke on the neck, a hand on the cheek, a touch on the ear. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"A well set anchor, repeated during several orgasmic moments can be a gold mine later. During that same time you can stack anchors. As you touch or squeeze her to set the kinesthetic anchor, also say a word or phrase that will connect with this state. Something like, I WANT YOU NOW Or, I’M YOURS Or, WARM IN HERE Then later, during a conversation, you can fire your kinesthetic anchor and say the words at the same time. You could even be commenting about the temperature of the room, and as you say “Is it just me, or is it getting WARM IN HERE”... and then you use the K anchor as well. You are accessing an orgasm state. Later, when you are together during a conversation, you can intentionally fire this anchor. If you have properly stacked your anchors and use them during a waking trance you will probably have to leave the restaurant. In other words, touch her exactly like you touched her during that orgasm. It will connect with the feelings of ecstasy and start the heart pumping... for you! If you do this right, don’t be surprised if she suddenly wants to go somewhere quiet with you. Well, it might not be quiet for long... The Whisper Anchor A whisper already has an effect of making us curious, wanting to hear what nobody else should hear. When you lean over and say something softly into your lover’s ear it will create a very focused state just because it is a whisper. You can also embed suggestions in the whisper. So imagine using your anchors to elicit a state of desire, then leaning in and whispering what it is that you want! A well placed word or phrase that has been anchored during a state of desire, such as I WANT YOU NOW , in a low whisper can be sensational. Set this anchor during sex. Use the exact same wording each time and say it in a whisper. Then fire the anchor later in a public setting. Whisper it low and soft,"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"and even if your partner acts like they don’t hear it, rest assured that their subconscious mind heard you just fine.

It is, for the most part, not possible to do mind control with hypnosis, unless you have your subject in an environment where they will not have outside influences, are deprived of certain needs, deprived of sleep and food, and rewarded for being obedient and faithful. It is a myth that I could walk up to you, snap my fingers and say sleep, and have you fall into my arms in a puddle. You have probably seen this in stage hypnosis or on TV, and it does work when the expectation is there, and the subject has volunteered to come up and be hypnotized. If someone has volunteered, and chosen to come up on stage, I need only look in his eyes and watch him melt. It probably won’t happen to the man on the street. Although if it could, you know I would have some major fun with it. When you learn hypnosis, and you tell someone you are a hypnotist, you have unlocked the first door. They will pr obably be intrigued and pre-conditioned just knowing that you are a hypnotist. They may think you have some mystical power and their subconscious mind may begin to go into a trance just looking"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"into your eyes. In my experience, most people are curious about hypnosis and have always wondered what it will be like to be hypnotized. So, there is a good state, yes? Interest, Curiosity, Desire, Trance You can intensify the amount of desire, or the object of desire with hypnosis. In trance, whether it is waking trance or closed eye trance, inserting words like, want me... closer to me... feel better here... as you trust me... can influence the mind into creating the desire for the person who is speaking. In the section on language patterns and embedded commands you will learn valuable ways to influence the mind into desire, willi ngness, and trust. You could also create desire for something like a certain sexual act, position, or favor. You could create a desire for oral sex in a woman who previously had no desire for it. ( Now I have your attention, huh?) However, if you are total putz, none of this will help you. You are going to have to study up on charisma and rapport. Trance and language patterns are good, but they cannot make up for bad intentions, stupidity, evil thoughts, or bad teeth. Mind control in many ways is a misconception. We don't really have the ability to control someone else’s mind with or without hypnosis. When a person responds to our suggestion, on some level there was agreement. Hypnosis and Waking Trance, can help to create a state of mind where we are more persuaded to do something or go along with something. The degree to which someone's mind agrees to go along with something is based on the level of trust. If there is no trust, there can be no hypnosis, or trance. And if there is no trance there is no suggestibility. "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 6 Hypnotic Response in Deep Trance “Lead me not into temptation, I can find the way myself.” -Rita Mae Brown Hypnosis can create amazing effects in deep trance. A person can be made to feel pain, to eliminate pain, get aroused, have orgasms, hallucinate the future, change bodily functions, slow heart rate, and even stop pain to the extent that surgery can be done under hypnosis as the only anesthesia. There is a well known effect of hypnosis that really shows how powerful the mind can be in creating a physical response based on thought. A person who is hypnotized can be told that they are going to feel a hot coal placed on their leg. An ice cube is placed on the leg and the brain has difficulty distinguishing this feeling from the intense heat of what it thinks is a hot coal. Now, the really exciting part is that in many cases, the skin will actually produce a burn. The skin will react just as a burned area of skin would, creating a blister and filling with fluid. If our minds are this powerful, and respond with such a dramatic change in the physiology with only a thought, imagine the possibilities for sexual pleasure! Not that we are going to be inflicting burns, honest. It is just an example of the mind’s ability to respond to suggestion. You cannot underestimate the power of thought. It is the one and only thing that truly creates your reality, your perceptions and your"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"beliefs. Your thought is the thing that you own, that you have control of, and that you choose. In my experience, with thousands of hours of hypnosis and hypnotherapy, I can tell you that I am still amazed at the ability of the subconscious mind to create the reality it desires and the response it has to the thoughts we think. I have worked with a lot of sexually dysfunctional and frustrated people. I know that their thoughts and the way they choose to respond to those thoughts, is the one thing they own. The one thing , that can bring intense happiness or intense sorrow, the one thing that is free and that nobody else can give you, sell you, or choose for you, is your ability to choose your thoughts. When someone who is impotent thinks about having sex, they typically think about the impending failure that is going to happen. If someone has premature ejaculation they think about how disappointed they will be... and usually nothing else! If you want to change the outcome you have to give your mind another possibility. If the only possible outcome is failure, then your mind can only find and produce all the responses needed to fulfill that outcome. You get to choose your thoughts. You get to choose how you feel on a minute to minute basis. If you project into the future minute or hour how bad you are going to feel, or how disappointed you will be when you can’t get an erection, then you produce only those feelings that go with that outcome. I have a little mantra that I use when I don’t like the way I feel. It is... “I choose how I feel”. Now... I am reminded that I can continue to feel this way or start feeling some other way! You also choose the way you think, so pay attention.

A woman could suggest to a man, that he will not be able to come until she says the word, or that he will not be able to have an erection for anyone but her. (Not nice, but hey, we chicks are looking for anything that will keep you from straying). A post hypnotic suggestion to create desire could be: “Whenever you see me touch my chin and say deeper , your body will get warm, your genitals will become very tingly and aroused... and with every breath you breathe....as you inhale that sensation will increase and grow and spread throughout your body.” Or this... “Whenever you hear the phone ring and it is my voice, your body will respond... your heartbeat will increase with every word that I say, as you feel this sensation growing deep inside of you, that sensation creates desire with each beat of your heart. This desire is for me, my smell, my touch, my body pressed against yours...” OK, you get the idea. Is it warm in here, or is it just me?"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" Once hypnotized, the mind has many possibilities for ways to experience pleasure. You could live out a forbidden fantasy, be actors in an erotic movie, increase sensation when you snap your fingers, turn up the intensity with a key word, suggest that you taste like the most delicious chocolate sauce, make genitals very sensitive to touch or to a puff of breath, create an orgasmic response from head to toe, become an animal and allow all your instincts to take over. You can travel together in trance, going to a place where both of you share an experience of extreme pleasure or a journey to an island paradise together. You can create a pleasure room in your mind, where upon passing through the door, you are only capable of receiving pleasure and enjoying the awaiting adventure! Once in this pleasure room, every sensation, touch or word could bring feelings of pleasure. The possibilities are endless, and if you have a basic knowledge of hypnosis, you can go straight to the scripts or to the CD or tape. If you are still working on gaining rapport and having enough charisma so that you can actually have someone to hypnotize, then read on. You can learn to be magnetic, charismatic and irresistible.

Have I shocked you?” And I said, “God no – I was just packing.” -Helen Lederer A person will not be hypnotized against their will. They can reject anything you suggest. But sometimes they don’t know they can reject it, or the offer is just too irresistible! So at times the suggestion can have an effect because the person worries that it will have an effect. Or it may have an effect because they want it to have an effect. You might suggest: Every time you touch your keys, your desire for me becomes greater and every time you hear your keys jingle... your desire for me grows and becomes almost unbearable, and you find that you can think of nothing else. The more you try to think of something else... the more your mind comes back to me... and the deep desire you feel... and you want and allow this to happen. "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Now, your subject has a choice of not accepting that suggestion, but the worry it creates for them about how they will respond when they touch their keys, will feed the suggestion over and over to their mind. What you resist persists. Another example would be in the case of insomnia. When an insomniac worries so much about whether or not they will sleep, that the worry alone creates the insomnia. The more they try not to think about whether or not they will sleep well the more anxiety it creates, producing the very thing they don’t want. Anytime you word a suggestion this way it becomes what is called, the law of reverse effect . The more you try to ______, the more you will find that you______. Or: Every time you think of _______, you will feel _______, and the more you try not to think of_______, the str onger this effect will be. When you form suggestions for your lover think about ways that you can create this reversed effect. Once you set up the possibility that they won’t be able to think of anything else the suggestion will grow and become self-fulfilling. 9 Rapport "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"“What comes first in a relationship is lust- then more lust.” -Jacqueline Bisset In order to create hypnosis there must first be rapport. When rapport is established, there is trust, and when the rapport deepens there is a subconscious trust. There can rarely be suggestibility without trust. There can be no trance without trust. To have trust, you must first be in good rapport with your subject. Rapport is the ability that some people come by naturally. We say that they have charisma. These people seem to have a magnetic personality. People who are able to create instant rapport have a lot of charm, and are very likable. The good news is that you don’t have to be born with great rapport. You can learn to have rapport and charisma, and with hypnosis you will learn to get yourself into a magnetic state on command. Being magnetic has its advantages! How do you create Instant Rapport? Having instant rapport allows us to persuade others. Persuasion is the art of bringing someone over to your way of thinking, whether it is for love, money or power. Persuasion can be achieved through language, intention and non-verbal communication. When we meet people who are very persuasive and seem genuine and sincere, we have to make a decision on some level to trust them. That decision is made based on what some people call a gut feeling. This gut feeling can be the result of words, body movements, eye movements, tone of voice, and the ability of the subconscious mind to perceive and compute these at an unconscious level. What is congruence? Our mind unconsciously has the ability to find c ongruence (in other words, does what you say match what you mean ?) and check all the data to find out if these verbal messages are"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"matching the internal messages. This congruence is what creates trust in the subconscious mind. When your words, body movements, eye movements, tone of voice all match on a subconscious level, it creates confidence and trust. Our subconscious mind knows if this trust is congruent and that is how we base our decisions on having sex, spending money, fa lling in love, and entering business relationships. Practicing these rapport skills is going to give you an advantage not only sexual, these skills will pay off big in your business and personal relationships. How does rapport make me Charismatic? Charisma is the charm that some people have when they have excellent skills in making all the outward signs match the internal signs. Add passion and sincerity, including internal integrity and intention and you become charismatic. One thing that charismatic people have in common is passion. They are excited about life and their words convey a passion for what they are doing. Notice some of the charismatic people that you know, and the one thing they all have in common is passion. Charisma can be learned and when a person has great skills in creating excellent rapport, congruence, and passion they have charisma. When you have charisma, you can be a very sincere man or woman and be very desirable to be around. When you are around someone who experiences life with passion you feel your own passion beginning to ignite. Your life feels a little more interesting and you feel more desirable. This is the heart of magnetism. So, what we want to do is: 1. create excellent rapport 2. gain trust 3. induce a waking trance 4. give suggestions 5. persuade another to come around to our way of thinking 6. create an irresistible magnetism "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"First and foremost, you must learn to create INSTANT RAPPORT. Good rapport is the way we feel about someone when we are alike . When the other person feels instantly comfortable with you and they don't really know why, that is probably great rapport.

I want to be closer to him.\""},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 10 A Master at Rapport “I am in favor of preserving the French habit of kissing ladies’ hands – after all, one must start somewhere.” - Sacha Guitry So, you want to become a master of rapport? You must start slowly and learn these skills, or rather master these skills one at a time until they become natural. It may seem odd the first few days, but then it will become automatic. As it becomes automatic you may find that other people respond to you differently. You may discover that others seem more interested in you, or more focused on what you have to say. Here is your assignment for the next few days. You will create instant rapport with everyone you meet. Even on the phone, (matching voice tone and tempo) you will create instant rapport. You must learn this before you can do any hypnosis, waking trance or suggestibility. 1. Match and Mirror the body movements. This one is very important. People who have charisma do this automatically. You stand like them, with the same body posture, you sit like them with your legs in a similar position. You gesture like them, almost as if you are a mirror. You tilt your head like"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"them when they tilt theirs. They will not notice that you are doing this consciously. It will be perceived by their subconscious mind on a deep level and they will begin to trust you without knowing why. The subconscious mind says that you are a lot like them. And we like people who are like us. You might feel uncomfortable doing this at first, and a little self conscious but it will get easier with time, and soon it will become automatic. Once you have the basics of matching and mirroring, you can use self hypnosis to make this skill become an unconscious automatic ability. You will be able to enter their reality and create an incredible connection. Use the tape or CD for magnetism. It will help you to have great unconscious rapport and will speed up the learning process. Listen to this tape for the entire week while you are practicing your rapport skills. 2. Match the persons pace and tone in their voice. Talk like them, speak slow and easy if they talk slow, fast and excited if they talk fast, and if they are monotone, you must be monotone. If they are excited you must match that level of excitement. If they are sad, you must first meet them in their sad state. It is true that happiness is contagious, but not when someone is in a very different state than that. Once you match their pace, you can then lead them into excitement, happiness or the state you desire. 3. Eye contact. You must maintain eye contact only to the extent that they maintain eye contact with you. If someone looks directly and constantly into your eyes, you match it. If they have wandering eyes, then yours must wander as well. You will create great discomfort for them if you have too much eye contact when they are not comfortable with strong eye contact. It will tell their subconscious mind that you are suspicious or invasive. And if they have strong eye contact, you must get"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"comfortable with it, and allow them to see into your eyes as well. Your eyes cannot dart around the room or avoid their glance. 4. Standing The position we take when we stand or sit with someone creates comfort. Women have no problem standing in a front to front position with other women and there is no invasion of personal space from this positioning. However, in the case of two men, or a man and a woman, you must change the position to a 90-degree angle. For comfort and rapport where there are two men standing, they should stand at an angle to each other. A man and woman should stand at an angle until you have good rapport. Once rapport is established, you can enter his or her personal space and stand face to face. Two women can stand face to face without it being invasive. A woman will feel comfortable if you stand face to face with her once rapport is established, however a man will not. 5. Listening. Before you respond to someone's statement or question, you must get across to him or her that you have heard what they said. This tells me that the person truly cares about me, that he cares about what I say, and that I can trust him. Before you speak, take a deep breath and pause. This tells the subconscious mind of your partner that you heard what was said and this creates trust. If you learn nothing else from this book, learn this : There is a great deal of sincerity, caring and trust that is created when someone conveys that they are listening and attentive to our needs. By taking a breath before you speak, you create a wonderful atmosphere of caring and trust. If you are a habitual interrupter, it may be time to stop talking and start listening. If you listen 90% of the time and speak 10% of the time in a conversation, you will probably be well liked!"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Interrupting tells me that you don’t care what I have to say. You are not interested in who I am, and that what you have to say is way more important than anything I could possibly say. If you are an interrupter you will have a difficult time establishing good rapport. Do these things for one week with everyone that you can. Refine these skills to the point where you are very comfortable with it. Remember that in order to create a Waking Hypnotic Trance in which suggestions are accepted by the subconscious we must first create trust. To create trust, we must have rapport. There is much more to learn, and once you master these skills you master the trance skills and create an opening for trance to happen. These rapport skills are subtle to the conscious mind, but to the subconscious mind they are gold. Now, do it for a week. Don’t just think about it, don’t just agree that this is a good idea, actually do it! Listen to the Hypnosis for Magnetism tape every day as you are creating excellent rapport. "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 11 Creating a Waking Trance “If you obey all the rules, you miss all the fun.” -Katherine Hepburn Matching-Pacing-Leading Let’s say you have mastered Rapport and you are giving out all the signals to his or her subconscious mind to trust you and like you, and you are listening sincerely. Now you can begin to create a waking trance. In a waking trance we begin to ask our partner’s subconscious mind to follow us by pacing and leading. Once the mind is unconsciously following us, we can then lead it into trance. Now you are ready to take your excellent rapport to the next level. You can begin now to match your partner’s breathing. Matching breathing can create a powerful connection with his or her subconscious mind. Breathe at the same pace as your partner. The subconscious mind will perceive this as a deep signal that he or she can trust you because you are so much like them. The previous skills you mastered, of matching and mirroring, should be almost automatic before you begin matching and pacing the breathing, so as you match the breathing it will easily fit in and flow. One way that you can help your mind to learn this is to notice the speech patterns. As someone speaks, they are breathing out. As"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"they pause, they are breathing in. Allow your breath to match their speech. When they are not speaking watch for the rise and fall of their chest. The breathing connection can be made very elegantly if you are not actively thinking about what movements you are trying to match. So, you should have your matching and mirroring by now, automatic. Remember the subtle cues of rapport and remember to fold your arms closed if theirs are closed, cross your legs if theirs are crossed, avoid eye contact if they do, keep eye contact if they do. By now you are probably doing all of this automatically and you are ready to learn to pace and lead. You can even match, mirror and pace someone who you are not even having a conversation with. You can do this with someone who is sitting or standing across a crowded room. The unconscious mind perceives much more than we can imagine and our mind will pick out of a group of people the ones who are most like us. I paced someone in an airport recently to test this theory. There were several hundred people waiting to board the plane. I chose a man, about 30 feet away, matched his movements, stance, breathing, but never made eye contact or even so much as a smile. A few minutes later, when I was in line to board, he walked right up next to me and said hi. This was more than a coincidence. His mind unconsciously found my similarity and out of a group of people and possibilities was drawn to the one who was most like him. Now that you are in Rapport, you are matching movements, breathing together, pacing voice and tone, you can begin to lead. Leading is the beginning of creating a waking trance. You can only lead once you are in deep rapport, and when the mind is unconsciously tuned in. As you lead the other person, you will find out what an amazing influence you have with your new power of persuasion. "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Leading means that we can change the way another person feels by changing our outward posture and body language or by the tempo or tone of our voice. If you are in good rapport and you change your posture, tone, or pace of your words, the other person will usually follow. This is a lot of fun when you notice that it is working. If your partner does not follow your lead, then you were not in good rapport. If you have been matching the voice tempo and volume, you can begin to lead with the tone of your voice. This is where you can begin to speak in a rhythm, and a more relaxing tone slowing your voice down to about 60 beats per minute. This will bring their heart rate down to a deeper level of relaxation. Physical leading starts with a body movement. When you are matching the breathing, tone, and physical posture, and are in rapport.... now you can lead. Begin to lead with your movements. Slow down your arms and finger movements, let all of your body physiology relax and slow down. Your partner’s mind will notice these almost imperceptible details and begin to follow. Drop your shoulders, relax your face muscles, let your arms and hands get heavy. Everything that you do to relax, she will begin to match and relax as well. Start by slowly uncrossing your arms. Try doing that as you both exhale, as it will feel like a sense of relief. Next, uncross your legs. He or she should, at this point, follow your movements and uncross her legs and not be aware of why they’re doing it. A small movement, such as a hand up to your face, will often be duplicated. Try a simple movement of reaching for your glass, nodding your head, tilting your head, etc. If your leading is effectively being followed, you are in good rapport and leading. A person’s breathing will respond to leading and you can slow down the heart rate, blood pressure and really help someone relax when you pace their breathing. This also becomes a very erotic and sexually stimulating form of leading. Breathing together"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"creates a powerful connection. When your partner’s mind unconsciously begins to match your breathing it connects in a way that makes us feel as if we are one. Slow your breathing down, sigh, and slow your hand and body movements down. Remember to match the breathing (very powerful) for a while before you lead their breathing. Remember to develop some rhythm in your voice, slowing down, letting your words flow very smoothly. Lower the tone of your voice, and slow down the pace of your words. Your partner should now begin to talk slower. Exhale when they do, pause before you speak, and lead them into a wonderfully relaxed state. Create a rapport mantra in your mind. As you converse, allow this rapport mantra relax you and her. It is a heck of a lot better than an inner voice that says, “I hope she is relaxing, what if she doesn’t follow me, this will never work.” Or, “What if she doesn’t like me, I can never find anything interesting to say, what if she notices I am nervous.” The mind unconsciously will pick up the intention of this mantra. So, find the words that relax you and carry the message that you want to send. I am like you, I trust you, and you trust me. As you repeat this in your mind, it will create a greater atmosphere of trust and will help create a comfortable outward look in your face and your body to convey a simple message. Now that you are in rapport, you can now begin to do some very small movements that will begin to create a waking trance. On the table, or on your glass, begin to create a slow rhythm with your hand or just one finger. This almost imperceptible movement will be picked up by the subconscious mind, but rarely noticed by the conscious mind. Try to get the rhythm to about 60 beats per minute. (Which is about one per second) That will help the heart rate to slow down to match that rhythm of your hand and begin the waking trance. Another way to crea te that rhythm is to make very"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"tiny circles with your first finger on the table or a glass. For a woman, this can be perceived as very erotic, and can stimulate her mind to think about having her clitoris or nipple slowly rubbed. This is best if it is very subtle so that the conscious mind cannot filter it out. Women can stroke a stem of a wine glass (this one I won’t have to explain) or make slow back and forth movements on a table or along the finger of her other hand. Many times we do this automatically when we are entering the sexual rapport zone. I cannot tell you how many times I have caught myself unconsciously stroking the stem of that wineglass! Talk about body language! Many women do that automatically without being aware of the message. After a certain amount of time in sexual rapport you can create a deep and comforting sigh... a very light little sigh... and the subconscious will feel a sense of relief, similar to the feeling or sound of a sensual sigh. All the while, you are matching his or her breathing, leaning in when she leans in, leaning away as he leans away, and moving together as a mirror. Her mind, during this time will be reaffirming how much you are like her, and continue to build an atmosphere of trust. And in that trust there are words and language patterns that you can use to begin the trance. A nice, almost imperceptible sigh placed right into these tiny movements can really open up desire. Watch for her little tiny movements now. There are movements that indicate receptiveness and desire. Look for a tilt of the head. This usually indicates curiosity and a desire to know more. In a woman, look for fingers playing with her hair, or stroking her hair or neck. This is a good subconscious indication that she wants to be touched by you. (Don’t touch her yet) Look for movements of the fingers such as stroking a glass, stroking another finger, neck, and face. All of these are signals that she is comfortable and in rapport with you. Match these little movements on your own and notice how she does them. Find a similar movement that you can do on your glass, the table, or your other finger. And don’t worry about whether she can see it or not,"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"her subconscious mind is perceiving it. The experience is better if she is not aware of it consciously because that is what hypnosis is... the bypass of the conscious mind.

"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 12 Rhythm Rhythm, especially when it is perceived below the conscious level, is a trance inducer. I guess that is why when you think about hypnosis, you think about the dangling watch slowly going back and forth as the subject slips into a deep trance. Hypnotic rhythm is all around us and is used for advertising, in retail stores and in churches. What seems like the pulsing hum of an air conditioner, may actually be a well planned recording cycling at a beat that will place you into a more suggestible mindset. It also makes us lose track of time and linger longer where we are. In trance there is typically a time distortion in the amount of perceived time that has passed. In a hypnosis session if I ask the client how long they think they were in trance, they usually say 10 minutes or so, when in reality is was anywhere from 30-60 minutes. This time distortion in waking trance is responsible for the feelings we have of time flying by. Last time you were driving down the highway and went past your exit without noticing how far you’d driven you were probably in a trance and lost track of time. The rhythm of the road often creates what is called highway hypnosis. You can create a hypnotic rhythm during conversation that will put your partner at ease and make them more suggestible. Remember that first you must have rapport."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" You can create a subtle rhythm with your voice, pacing your words to have a slow, steady movement to them. If you practice, your conversation will begin to take on a poetic feel as your rhythm carries your words from an ordinary bit of conversation, to an en- trancing and poetic flow of words. The rhythm can be created in your body movements. If you are standing you can begin a very slow sway from side to side. It doesn’t need to be much, but you will notice your partner swaying to match your rhythm in a short time. Sitting at a table you can use many things to create this rhythm. Begin a slow rhythmic movement that your partner can see, maybe rubbing your fingers on the glass, on the table, or on your other hand. Continue this movement slowly and steadily. Their mind will unconsciously perceive the movement, follow it and begin to enter trance. Match the rhythm that is in your voice as it lowers and becomes soft, easy and comfortable. You are close to creating a waking trance.

She leans away, crosses her arms, or looks to the side, or her eyes are averted. What happened? Something broke rapport. In an instant, as quickly as rapport can be established, it can be broken. Many times it is little things that you do, that are not a problem for you, but they are for somebody else. Here are a few. Looking away at another woman. When you are in deep rapport, you are being scrutinized unconsciously by her inner mind. The moment you look away and glance at another woman, before she could even consciously analyze it, her unconscious mind found a break in the matching energy. It would be almost as if there was a good movie playing and the film suddenly broke. Her mind says, If you like me so much, how did that other woman catch your eye, and steal you away?! Her mind has processed this on an unconscious level at the speed of light. It says that everything you just did and said may not be congruent with what you really mean or want, or may not be congruent with your true intention. "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" Looking at her breasts At some point you think... A careful glance at the breasts, an undetected wandering of the eyes, couldn’t hurt, after all she is looking away... not noticing .... Unless a part of her is noticing. Remember how perceptive the subconscious mind is and how it sees all, knows all, hears all. This is one of those times. So, she glances away and you glance down at her breasts, and feeling guilty about peeking you quickly look away. This causes distrust, even if you are only looking at them while she is looking away, her subconscious mind saw it. From a woman’s perspective it is one of those very confusing aspects of ourselves that even we don’t quite understand. Here is what our mind thinks “I want you to look at my beautiful breasts, I want you to touch them, stroke them and bring me waves of pleasure.... that is why I push them up and out of my dress like this, however the moment you glance at them, a part of me decides that all you want is me naked and I am not yet convinced that you want me for my mind, and also care about me deeply...so... you better keep your eyes up here, bub. For now anyway.” Remember... Interrupting is a powerful rapport breaker. (Remember to take the breath after she is done speaking, and before you begin your sentence) Interrupting also tells her that you don’t really care about what she says, and what you have to say is more important than what she has to say.

To feel beautiful and to feel special. It is not enough to hear you say it. It must be congruent with what you are saying, projecting and expressing. When you say all the right things and then you are doing things that break rapport, she no longer feels beautiful and special. Remember how powerful our subconscious minds are at detecting incongruence. Notice the things that others do that bug you, or make you bored. Notice what people do who fascinate you and have charisma. Chances are that their body language and behavior is in agreement with what they are saying. Begin to model those qualities and become congruent in your message. Sometimes you may want to break rapport. You may need to get out of the conversation you are in. You can intentionally break rapport by changing your body language, posture, and tempo of your voice. Mismatch the other person as much as possible and change your tempo. When you need to break rapport possibly during business negotiations that are not going properly, or a conversation that is asking questions you would rather not answer, you want to create discomfort. Changing tempo, and learning how to get out of rapport quickly, can help shift the other person so you can make a fast break. "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 14 Deepening Rapport and Creating Trance Lets say you have mastered Rapport and you are giving out all the signals to her subconscious mind to trust you and like you, and you are listening sincerely. You have tested your rapport by leading, and all the signals are there that she and you are in great rapport. Now you can begin to create a waking trance. You are ready to take the rapport to the next level. You now begin to match her breathing. You must breath at the same pace that she is. Her mind will perceive this as a deep signal that she can trust you because you are so much like her. The previous skills of matching and mirroring should be almost automatic before you go to the breathing matching, so it will fit in and flow. Also, if these skills are becoming automatic, you will not look like a total goober as you are trying to coordinate all these new skills at one time. Learn one, master it then move on to the next. Breathing together creates a powerful unconscious sexual state. Sex is initiated in the mind and we can create our sexual reality by being inside of each other’s minds. The easiest way to do this is to breathe together. A tantric sex practice teaches a breathing technique that some say can bring one to the state of orgasm as a result of the deeply"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"shared energy. This technique is simple. The two of you sit or lay in a position where your faces are very close. As one partner exhales the other partner simultaneously inhales. Then as that partner exhales the other inhales. This creates a circular flow of breath and a powerful state of connection. The effect is that you are breathing in your lover’s energy through their breath, and breathing your sexual energy out to them as they inhale it. There is an intense matching that is happening and a deeply arousing build of energy. The matching is probably the most powerful aspect of this erotic exchange. When you are breathing together at dinner or over coffee you connect with a piece of this powerful sexual connection technique. Matching your partner’s breathing can be done in a way that feels natural and easy. The last time you were feeling very connected your were probably already matching breathing without even knowing it. And if it can be done on an unconscious level and you choose those times when you want to strengthen the sexual feelings and get deeper into waking trance, you may notice how this breathing brings out your own feelings of sexual desire. Use your rapport mantra at this time so your unconscious mind will enter her reality. (from the audio portion) I am like you, I trust you, you trust me. (If that doesn’t fit you, choose one of your own that puts you in a connected state.) Look for signs of waking trance: Gazing or staring, pupils dilating, palms open, shoulders relaxed, face or jaw relaxing, daydreamy look, eyelids droopy. You are almost there.... 15 "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" Eye Contact The eyes are the window to the soul. (Where have I heard that before?...) Eye contact that doesn’t match can really hurt rapport. You can say so much in your communication of your eyes, and you can lose so much if you communicate the wrong message. Now is a good time to gaze into her eyes for just a little too long. Notice that there is a difference between staring and gazing. Try a gaze that feels as if you cannot take your eyes off of her. Turn your head to the side... as if to look away, while keeping your eyes on her. Look on with sincerity and acceptance. This is the difference between gazing and staring. Breathe your intention (and yes your intention should be good, not evil) outward to her as you send your thought through your eyes. A well-intentioned gaze can melt a woman. I think many people are afraid of eye contact. It may be the discomfort that we have in our own souls that makes it hard for us to maintain good, open eye contact. Maybe it is because we don’t want others to see too deep inside of us. If you have trouble with eye contact it will be very hard for people to see you as sincere, open and honest. Bad eye contact states very loudly that you have something to hide. It says that you are not willing to get close and let someone in. You can get more comfortable with eye contact with practice. If you have a friend who can help you, you can do a little practice. Exercise for Better Eye Contact Sit in two chairs facing each other, so that your knees are almost touching. On the first round, maintain eye contact for only one minute. Sixty short seconds without saying a word.... But these sixty may feel like an eternity. After sixty seconds, tell each other what your experience was. Talk about how it felt, what you felt the"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"other person was projecting, and about the feelings you were projecting. Next, maintain eye contact for tw o minutes. This time focus on a word that carries a feeling, without verbalizing the word, to the other person. During the entire time continue to send your thought through your eye contact to the other person. Here are some possibilities for you. Trust, safety, sensual, sad, pleasing, loving, fearful, curious, excited, erotic, healing. After the two minutes, talk about what you felt you were receiving from the other person. This exercise will greatly increase your ability to read another persons intentions. It will also help you to be more comfortable with good, trusting, inviting eye contact. Look at her body Permission granted! If you have good rapport and trust you can now break eye contact and look down at her body in an admiring way, sweeping slowly with your eyes from head to toe. Now here is an important part. Bring your eyes back up to hers after surveying her body. When you bring your eyes back to hers after gazing at her body, it conveys adoration, and approval. It says that you are not ashamed of what you did, rather than feeling guilty by looking away. When you look back in her eyes, take a deep breath and sigh. Say, you are so beautiful . Or just one word... lovely . As a woman I can tell you that this can be a powerful rapport maker! When a man looks at me in that open and obvious way and adores my body, hair or face it gives him permission to take the next step! "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"   "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 16 Primary Representational System We all have a primary way of experiencing our lives, our selves and the events around us. Some of us are visual, some are auditory, and some are kinesthetic. If you are creating rapport with someone who is primarily visual in processing information, and you speak and describe in auditory terms, it will be very difficult to connect and create rapport. For instance a husband says about his wife, “I don’t understand why my wife doesn’t think I love her. I tell her I love her everyday. How could I make it sound any clearer to her. It sounds like we just aren’t made for each other after all.” This tells me that he is primarily auditory. The way that he knows he is loved is by hearing it, and the way that he expects others to feel loved is by telling them. It is only the most obvious thing in the world to him, that in order to express your love, you must tell the other person. Here is what she says. “I just don’t feel loved by him. I feel like I am unlovable. He hardly ever touches me, and I don’t get a feeling of warmth from him. “ She feels loved when someone responds to her kinesthetic needs. She needs to be touched, to be held, and to"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"feel warm and comforted kinesthetically in order to know that she is loved. She also says, “I know he tells me he loves me, but those are just words and I the words just feel empty to me.” AHA! Now, you might understand why so many couples are expressing the same thing but the way it is received doesn’t have the right connection for them. No matter what your communication is, it will have the most powerful effect if you know which representational system to send it to. There is no wrong way to process information. Visual, auditory or kinesthetic are all wonderful and unique. There are no right or wrong ways to experience life. However, we all do it differently and if you are going to be a master at rapport you must find the system key. Begin to notice if your partner is visual, kinesthetic, or auditory. (I know this is a lot to learn, but it does get automatic after a while.) A good way to find out is to ask a question that will demand the answer you need. “Where did you go on vacation?” “What did you like most about the vacation?” “What was the most relaxing thing you did?” Visual: The sunsets were beautiful, just out of this world. I could really see myself going back there next year. When I laid in the hammock I could see the stars above and that view was one to remember. Auditory: The sound of the waves was so soothing, it was so quiet there. I listened to music at night, it seemed to float over the beach right to me and I told myself I would come back here next year. Kinesthetic: I loved laying on the warm sand, it was so comforting to feel myself soak up the warm, soothing sun. I took a long walk and I felt so at peace and had a real sense of balance... I feel I would go back next year. "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"This is a great way to find out their primary system. Now you can use your words to appeal to your partner in ways that will really connect for her. Tell your story from his or her system. Change your visual words to auditory words, or kinesthetic descriptions. Let your words paint a picture in her mind (V), or sound like music to her ears (A), or a create a soothing feeling in her soul (K)! And let the words flow smoothly, and descriptively. In my hypnotherapy practice I use as many different types of words as possible to include all three systems. Many of us have a primary modality and also process in a secondary modality. If you create a multi-sensory experience you‘ll have all your bases covered. Create words that have feeling, color, and sound. For instance.... “I was at a most beautiful place a few days ago, a h illside overlooking the valley, perhaps you have seen it? The sounds of the birds were very clear, it was the clearest day I think I have ever seen. Anyway, it seemed like I could hear the sounds of the birds even though they were far away, and then I noticed how many other sounds I could hear, almost as if I were hearing them inside of me.... Maybe you know what I mean. The reason I am telling you this is because of the very special feeling it gave me , a feeling that I was almost connected somehow, connected with nature, with the sounds ... almost as if the wind and the warm sun had a voice. You might think it is a little odd, but sometimes there is a moment when you notice that everything feels right , I mean... that you see things more clearly, you hear sounds deeper, and it just feels like you are meant to be right here, right now . Well, maybe you don’t know, I didn’t know until just then, like just in this instant, what it felt like to be totally entranced by my surroundings. It felt like I couldn’t leave, like I wanted to stay forever . It almost feels sensual... like the most satisfying sexual experience... to be this connected with something. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever felt like that?” In this story you have created a path to all of her senses. You have opened up a place in her subconscious where she can feel what she hears and sees, and a suggestion for her inner mind to"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"KNOW in an instant that she is entranced and “in tranced”. The words in italics are an example of embedded suggestions that will suggest to her subconscious mind that she should feel that way now. When she tells you about a time when she felt like that, you will have a better idea of which sense she predominately uses. Listen as she describes an experience and notice if she talks about what she sees, hears or feels. When you discover what her primary sense is, you can then create your language to match the way her mind works. "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 17 Charisma and other things we learn Charisma is a learned skill. Powerful persuaders have charisma. They are excellent at rapport, sincere, and gain your trust quickly. Charismatic people are passionate about life. Magnetism is created largely due to the passion that someone exudes when they believe in something or when they believe in themselves. Passion for life, for love, and for the moment can be intoxicating. Practice being passionate about something... about anything! Use colorful, descriptive, emotional words. Be in the moment, never distracted, and create a point of focus that allows you to be passionate and fully interested in what your partner is saying. Describe your feelings with rich and beautiful words. Women love men that can speak descriptively! Practice it from a book, from colorful stories, or from observing others who are passionate until you get your own special language that is filled with mysterious, provocative, delicious, passionate words. An Exercise in Passion This can be quite entertaining. Do it alone or with an adventurous friend. Give yourself permission to really let yourself go when you"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"do this. Get way out of your comfort zone and find out how passionate you really can be. I did this years ago in a group and it really created a powerful passion anchor for me. The kind of passion I am looking for here is not sexual passion. It is a passion for life, for the ordinary. Even the most boring and mundane of tasks can be experienced from a place of passion. So here’s what you do. 1. Choose a story . You are going to tell about something that you did recently that was very ordinary, but something that you like doing. It could be a time when you hit a golf ball well, when you did a flip off the high diving board, or when you baked a great cake. It could even be when you taught your dog to sit. 2. Tell the story . No preparation, just let it be spontaneous. For about 2-3 minutes tell it in your usual way. If you are alone, tell it to your dog or to the chair. If you have a partner, let them sit there and listen. 3. Start at the beginning of the story and tell it again. This time tell it with the most passion you have ever had. You are so excited about how it feels to hit that golf ball or bake that cake, that you can feel it in your bones! Use words that describe the sights, sounds, feelings, and smells. 4. Turn up the volume. When you are passionate your voice has excitement in it, the tempo quickens and you become animated. 5. Use colorful words. Fabulous, wonderful, intense, awesome, unbelievable, tremendous.... Etc. Beef up your experience with words that involve your audience. Your dog will love this, trust me. 6. Notice how your body responds. You probably will find that your pulse quickens and you feel more awake and more alive. If you push yourself, you will find that you come up with words and descriptions that you didn’t know you have. 7. Now repeat the entire process. And double the intensity! At some point you may find that you are getting very creative and more interesting than you ever imagined you could be. This is your passion! "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" Now, I am not saying that you express yourself with this off the wall intensity every time you talk with someone. What I am suggesting is that you find your passionate self, that you know how to come from a place of passion where others really get that you are an interesting, exciting person. When you operate from this place, others feel good being around you. They feel more passionate about life and feel more drawn to you. Passion makes you magnetic. Passion inspires others to be passionate as well. Now, go back and do the exercise! Hey... really do it! Now. OK? It will be fun, trust me. Do it. Go find the dog. He’ll love it.

If your outcome is that the woman across the room will find you irresistible when you speak to her, that is an outcome! If your outcome is to make a mutually beneficial business deal, get the outcome you desire clear in your mind before you enter negotiations. See your outcome that you desire, feel it, experience it as real, even hearing the words that you want the other person to say. Doing this will focus your mind and allow you to make subtle shifts in your approach, allowing your mind to think creatively, and to be spontaneous. Above all, having and outcome in mind often will heavily influence the subjects state of mind. The subconscious mind can perceive the outcome that another person has created and will be influenced in that direction simply because your mind has a solid perception of what the results will be. Defining your outcome takes only a few minutes, maybe 3-5 minutes, but you could do it in 30 seconds if that is all you have. Any amount of time spent focusing on the outcome, will increase the influential power you have while in rapport. Now, if you are in a public place and you see a woman you want to meet, create your outcome of how drawn she is to you and how she will feel she has known you for a long, long time. Maybe your outcome is that she"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"will have dinner with you or go for coffee tomorrow. If you focus on this outcome, seeing her having dinner with you, hearing your mutual laughter, and feeling comfortable and relaxed with her, you might be surprised when she approaches you first! Thoughts are powerful things. Others perceive our thoughts on a subconscious level and their feelings are shifted on some level based on our thoughts. Another word about those sexual outcomes. On an initial meeting with a woman, it is important NOT to place sex in your immediate outcome picture. Her subconscious mind will pick this up instantly and will feel that you are only after that one thing. (Unless of course she is also after only one thing. In which case you may want to tell her you are a hypnotist and she is under your spell and to follow you now.) It is OK to put this into an outcome picture after you have rapport and trust, but not before. It may close a door. As women, we know that sex is high on a man’s list of outcomes. Not a big surprise. However, we do want to feel that connection first. That bond is hard to create if the intention coming from the man is all about sex.

Or it can create a powerful disharmony in the subject’s subconscious mind. I recently listened to a radio call in show, and the caller talked about how much he loved his girlfriend and yet her voice really spoiled his romantic mood. He found it very hard to stay aroused when he heard her sharp, annoying voice.

You must find and develop your own irresistible voice. The number one way to change your voice quality is to practice it. Read these next few sentences out loud. As you read, allow your voice to become lower, softer, and smoother. This hypnotic voice comes from deep in your diaphragm. It is low and smooth, much like a soft moan, but with words. If your voice is nasal, or throaty, too high pitched, or choppy, it can annoy the listener and break rapport. Especially important is the effect of an accent. Accents can be highly erotic or highly annoying. Some"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"accents will make it harder to gain rapport in some cases, so it is especially important to practice getting a good tone to the voice so it conveys warmth, depth and sincerity. Take time to practice your soothing voice. Let it come from deep in your belly. Practice talking in flowing words with a soothing tone. As you are getting into rapport your voice should become lower and more pleasant, more melodic. Practice creating a rhythm with your voice. Imagine your voice having the quality of a beautiful song, with a comfortable melody, harmonious and balanced. Find a tape recorder and record your voice. Listen to your voice with headphones as you record it and you will be able to make the changes as you are speaking. I have heard women say things like, the moment I heard his voice I melted. It was so seductive. A great and seductive voice can make up for a lot of flaws. Use your voice to your advantage. Train it just as you would train your body to run farther or your fingers to type faster. Time spent training your voice will benefit you in business, negotiations, phone skills and above all, it will help you get more great sex! This is not the complete book.
