It is a book that is much needed in the occult community because it shows other magicians how to take memetics, semiotics, writing , and other related pursuits and adapt them to magical practices, while also pushing those magical practi ces into new directions. Magic is no longer restricted to ceremonial tools and garb. Magic is something more. Magic, in this book, is about taking the cultur al forces around u s and using the m to shape reality . That’s pretty powerful. In fact, it’s a recognition that if magic is to continue to evolve ; it has to evolve with the technology of the time, while also using that technology in ways that mo st people will probably never think of. The magician is a pers on who fits into any time, any space, and does so by choosing to take on the available tools and 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"cultur al mindsets and use them to achieve what s/he desires. What’s really imp ortant though is that We s and Edward recognize that the stories we tell about ourselves have magic, and all we need are the right tools to let that magic come forth and manifest into our lives. We can choose to tell our stories, or we can cho ose to manifest them. We can cho ose to create and work with chara cters who can help us achieve our goals, or we can continue to be at the mercy of other peo ple’s memes. I prefer a proactive approach and that is exact ly what Wes and Edward are offering in this book. Taking a proactive approach to magic necessarily involve s experimentation and inn ovation and you will find a lot of that in this book. Take your time, try out what the authors suggest, and let it soak into you. Let the memetic wizardr y they create show you the potential at your fingertips, as well as continue to pave a path toward the future of magica l practice . On a personal note, I’ll admit to being very pleased to see how Wes and Edward have taken some of my own theories and practi ces and derived their own variations and concepts fro m that work. It’s an ins piration for me to 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"keep experimenting and learning and creating. It provides me further incentive because it shows me other people are on a similar path to my own. That’s something which is really nee ded, because we are entering into new territory when it comes to magical practi ce. Having peo ple to journey with, to share ideas with, and to experiment with when you are in uncharted territory, makes what you do a bit less daunting, and also makes for some very intriguing discussions, as I discovered at Esoz one when I was able to chat with both Edward and We s for the first time in person. I still have hopes of getting some more time with them at some point, because there is so much I want to ask! That’s always the way of the experimenter. When you find others doing similar work, you suddenly feel as if a whole new horizon had appeared. Or at least, that’s how I feel after talking with both of them and reading their work. I hope their work will be as inspiring to you as it has been for me, and that it will fire within some of you a desire to write your own stories, develop your own practi ces, and share them with other magicians , and fellow travelers. We need all the inno vation we can get, especial ly given the times we live in. This book is another step in the right direction for magical practice . It challenges us to evol ve and grow and stop s ettling for less. 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"With that said, it’s time for me to depart and let Wes and Edward take the stage.

Seth Godin has replaced Joey Skaggs. Is any of this bad news? No. I quote the poet Diane DiPrima, who answered a similar question I p osed to her in 1 992 * : JM : It seems to me that rebellion i tself has become a commodity, t he media has co opted rebellions like rock- n-roll, Dada, Surrealism, poetry, the rebel figure.

Just ch eck your COINTELPRO history to see an example of a conscious conspiracy to stop us. Other times it was just a repetition of what has gone on before. Like the ants going back to where the garbage used to be. (laughs) I couldn't agree more. Back in the day, when I first started disse minating the Incunabula Papers via xero x, BBS, Gopher, FTP and eventually Web, eBook, print and audiobook * I was part of a new culture of on-line tricks ters, mages, clowns, and poets, known collectively as “culture jammers” (Mark Dery's claim to ownership of the term not withstanding) . 10 years later, I was being contac ted by representatives of corporate brands to 'do that thing' for their products. Eventually , someone dubbed 'that thing' as viral marketing, which was to mor ph in a few directions, one of which was Alternate Reality Gaming and a myriad of other 'ser vices' and methods of hawking wares. I give you this thumbnail look at the history of on-line meme tennis for a reason.

Moving far ahead of such Rube Goldberg attempts, Wes and Edward have drawn up a capable roadmap which leads... where? The good news is, they don't know anym ore than you or I do. The even better news is, they don't pretend to know. Most people hammer your mind with Thesis>Antithesis>Synthesis or as my my old friend the late Robert Anton Wilson said: “Here' s what is is, here' s what it isn't, now here's why you need to go tell everyone how smart I am.” I can't tell you how much that tired old formula skee ves me. When I do see people brave enoug h to (god forbid!) put the onus of drawing a conclusion back on the reader (heresy!), I am not only relived (what, me have to think?) my faith in humanity has it's execution stayed another day.

Now I am faced with a similar conundrum. What to say? How many pages could I go on about what you're about to read? In the end, why should I? (word count quotas not withstanding) .

Magic is perhaps the mo st loaded term we use through out the text, and we propose the same definition Taylor Ellwood puts forth in his book Multi- Media Magic: “ Magic involves making the improbable possible. It’s learning how even the slightest change you make can have a radical effect on the internal system of your psychology/spirituality, and the external system of the environment and universe you live in. ” 1 Memes are nearly as difficult to define, although Richard Dawkins was very 1 Ellwood, Taylor, (2008) Multi-Med ia Magic , p.90.

Cybernetics deals with systems that emb ody goals and networks which transmit memes include internal psychic processes, multi- or trans-media narratives, religious, governme ntal , corporate, and academic institutions, and both local and non-local social settings.

We use terms from magic such as egregore and sigil 8 as a way to illustra te the dynamic forces at work within group minds, as well as approaches to harnessing those forces to transform systems. There are two models of memetics we are using concurrently; one is the seed or virus model where small scale individual signals infect hosts and predis pose them to particul ar actions. This model is most useful for creating communications and understanding how they spread. The second is the entity mo del, useful for understanding political and social movements.

The Hollywood of today is the true sacred site of the elite magician. Thanks to the research of the last twenty years, we now have two models of memetic space: Meme space as cyberspace, a virtual space that occupies the nodal memory of a com municat ion network, and Meme space as long tail 11 , or a population of meme carriers .

Language which has emerged from both science and magic has a place in defining the coming paradigm. Our relation to the invisible is structured in accordan ce with magical theory, and the technological application now of waves, harmonics, wireless networks is manifesting emergent consciousness in precisely the ways predicted by magical theory. This isn’t to say that superstition is preferable to technic al knowledge. Magic has always been about the encoding of meaning, about symbolic liter acy, about the creat ion and even the restoration of calendars. Memetics is a way of comprehen ding the ramifications of such encoding, identifying the systems that result fro m rituals , and transmitting meaning into a goal- oriented complex system, the meme space. Understanding the me metic ecosphere ( see figure of meme ) and meta- biological organisms that share meme space alongside us flesh and blood types is the respo nsibility of the memeticist. 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The memetic ecos phere is directly analogous to the concept of cyberspace . A virtual space is created when the nodes of a communication network have me mory. While it is intermittent in time and space, it is concurrent in the imaginal time of the communication occurring. 12 An example of a limited form of cyberspace is the teleconference 13 , in which numerous telephone attendees meet in an auditory space where everyone is privy to the conversation and the conversation itself is being recorded for future playba ck. Nodal memory is a pattern that allows cyberspace to exist and this concept of nodal me mory holds true for human social networks as well. The mem ory of individuals is a kind of nodal memory, and the interac tion that individuals engage in form the connections that define the network. So in essence, there is a type of cyberspace that exists entirely on the 'hardware' of human brains and personal social interac tions. This cyberspace is the 'meme space' and has been called the Noos phere by Pierre Teilhard 14 before the concept of memetics was fully fleshe d out by Richard Dawkins. Once we have a conceptual space, it is simple enough to conceptuali ze the bodies that move within that space. These bodies are ideas, or me mes, and 12 We refer you to the a ppendix for more on ‘imaginal time.’ 13 The teleconfer ence is also an ideal interface for a mastermind group w orking non- locally., especially when supp lemented with file and document sharing online. 14 Teilhard de Ch ardin, Pierre (1959) The Phenomena of Man 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"their sur vival is dependent upon persistence in nodal mem ory. Memes incline the host organism to actions that further the me me's survival in some manner. Sometimes the actions increase replicat ion via com munication over various types of networks, sometimes they increase the meme 's persistence in memory. Many times the actions the meme encourages adjust these two primary factors indirectly . Observed actions are a kind of com munication, so meme s spread via performance as well as through verbal intera ction. Performing an action plants the idea of the performance as action in the minds of the observers. Think of this book as a capsid 15 for a virus, or casing for a plant’s seed. In order to survive and spread, memes need communication between potential hosts and a way to interac t with the host organism's motivational system. To carry this idea into the text itself, it is in this book’s best interest as a memetic wrapper for us as authors to include the next paragraph: Very few people make it past the first chapter of a book, just as many people never fully ingest a me me.

In addition, me mes that depen d on specific population and com municat ion patterns will not encourage the change of those patterns, as the memes that sup port these existing orders will be more common and have more traction in general within those patterns. Memes that depe nd on new technological advances in communication mediu ms will be more likely to encourage changes in the social order towards supporting those new mediums.

Thankfully this eventuality is unlikely, as in general memes will sup port communication innovation as a way to engender greater replica tion probability . In other words, reproduction is a primary drive for a memetic body in this conceptual nodal space.

A useful understanding is that there are many subsystems, or circuits, within the overall system of the world. There are many paths that a signal can take through these circui ts either serially or concurrently. The react ions to or transformations of our actions along these multiple pathways can either reinforce each other and increase the effects of our signals or conflict and decrease the effects. The greater the scope of our understanding the greater our abili ty to release signals that will be reinforced by more subsystems, and correspondingly the greater potential our actions can have toward manifesting change on the world.

Memetics doe s not in general affect things directly, but rather mu st work through, or on, human agents. While we are generally only conscious of me ssages that are delivered linearly via some specific linguisti c pattern, our nervous system also absorbs messages of ass ociat ional or juxtapositional natures. However, there is no reason to assume memetics requires language to operate. All identity construction, in addition to being a kind of bricolage , is also existent only within a social context. You do not have an identity without some kind of commu nity formation against which to project that identity. This commu nity space is also a theater in which performance and stress builds connections.

The “Zeigarnik Effect” is how an incom plete pattern never fully dro ps into one’s unconscious but remains free-floating in the preconscious mind.

An other instance of behavior modification through meme adoption is represented in the protocol or etiquette attached to specific social situations. The protocol of a coffee sho p, for example, exists in the mem ories of the staff of the shop and the environ ment which has been shaped to fit a set of behavioral expecta tions of the staff as well as the customer. Then, within that space, all of the individuals act according to those ex pectat ions. As the customers follow the cues made by the em ployees, they are obeying the protocol while at the same time reinforcing the protocol set that is part of the overall coffee sho p me meplex. Of course, over time the customers can affect changes in the way the store operates, but only if the staff accepts the differences in behavior, as the staff spends the most time in that space and as such has a greater influence over the protocol 63 of that space. Various social contexts could be envisioned as differently interconnected communication networks and we could examine how these 62 See Clive Thomas’ article, “Is the Tipp ing Point Toast?” at http://www.fa stcompany.com/ magazine/122/is- the-tipping-point-toast.html 63 Protocol is the expectation of how to behave within a particul ar context, and is often attached to a physical space. 124"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"configurations affect movement, retention, and alter ation of the content that exists on these networks. Bearing this in mind, let's examine ways in which to spread a signal on a com munication network. Referring again to the descriptors taken from The Tipping Point , we can understand connectors to be primary hubs within the network. They broadcast the meme into many different clusters, exposing many people to the signal but not necessarily effectively infecting those clusters with the meme. Salesman will alter the signal to suit their audiences, and while they don't expo se as many people to the me me they do infect a greater percentage than a connector. However, because they do alter the signal to fit their audience they carry the risk of distorting the signal. Mavens tend to hold the most detailed version of the signal, and act as a repository or cache of the me me's core message; however Mavens tend to broadcas t to the least number of p eople. Thus the three primary ways in which a signal spreads across a network relies on manipulating the content of the signal for the network, manipulating how the signal enters the network, or manipulating the structure of the network to more easily transmit the signal. Social epide mics or outbreaks are not alw ays biological in nature. Memes are socially transmitted and cannot exist in the absence of 125"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"communication or other social behaviors. Social pressures are a large part of the motivational strategies that memes depend on to leverage their mo vement and spread within a social body. Different social or communicative frameworks place different constraints on the replicat ion and survi val strategies of memes. Therefore different social structures encourage and strengthen different meme populations. It would be nearly impo ssible to imagine a 'Flat Earth' meme spreading by space travel to a lunar colony, for example. As pre viously me ntioned, if you want to affect someone emotionally, you should tell them a story. Stories are a fundamental human invention that predates logic, and for that matter appears to predate writing. Stories evolved after emotion and most likely came into being concurrent ly with language and consciousness. Stories fit neatly in between emotions and consciousness, and bind em otional feelings with a linear sen se of time. Stories began as a linear arrangement of emotional triggers with a beginning, middle, and end. As humans, we are wired to crave completeness to our stories, and this craving is how you can use a story to manipulate desire and behavior in individuals. 126"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The Zeigarnik 64 Effect, as discussed in chapter five, indicates that an inco mplete task or narrative is retained in one's me mory until it can be res olved. By telling a story with appropriate emotional triggers and leaving it incomplete in such a way that the only way to achieve satisfa ctory closure is for the audience or target to take a specific act ion is a way to exploit this effect 65 . This unknown partia l pattern is also the basis of hermeneutic code, and both the semic and hermeneutic codes work because of the brain's pattern recognition and its desire to close the figure. Narra tive is a primary pattern to the neuropathology of conscious thought. It is a pattern of linear causative relations that is particul arly compelling once recognized as such. Cliffhangers, ongoing serialized narrat ives, and nested NLP commands all involve this kind of incompleteness that engages me mory and cognition toward a specific end. Music in commercials often uses this technique as well, and even ringtones represent this kind of incompleteness and loo ping to alert the phone's owner to incoming calls.

Likewise, the whole pattern must someh ow be of value to the audience as a whole. As long as each piece is consistent, the non-linear storyteller is building a corresponding pattern in the mind of the audience. As they discover their own path through the web of synchronicity they will come to the source of the narrative because of a compulsion to complete the puzzle, fill in the blank, trac k down the meaning, or otherwise engage the media because of its discontinuous elements.

These are intelligen ces that are emergent properties of the com plex system that comp ose their bodies, and the individual peo ple within these social or corporate bodies are not in control because they are constrained by the system in which they are embedded.

But where does this leave the mind? Let's return to the computer metaphor again, this time e xamining the relation between hardware and software. Hardware is the machinery and software the protocol that dicta tes the performance of the machinery.

While some software comes pre-installed, for example your brain already knows how to direct your heart beating, kee p your lungs breathing, blink your eyes, all of which can be likened to the bios settings of a computer. Of course, you can make changes to these settings later by learning how to modify your heartbe at, or regulate your breathing, or consciously go without blinking for extended p eriods. After this pre-conscious bios layer the mental operating system is programmed. This other software needs to be learned when the brain is pro perly ready to absorb that data, such as learning to speak, defecate, swim, ride a bike or knit a sweater. Of course, the earlier these bits of software are learned the more integrated that knowledge becomes. This is why the programming we received in childhood can be so difficult to change, because the body has adapted to these ways of operating. Some research even suggests that mem ory is stored in muscle tissues, and further supports this integration of programming with the very structure of a growing body.

Again, this method is greatly enhanced by journaling or other form of record-keeping. One such altern ate for m of record-keeping that is possibly more effective than journaling for this kind of precon scious work is remixing and collage. Collage generally relates to visual and analog art, while remixing generally refers to digital audio and video work, but both are interchangea ble terms for the purp oses of this process of recording internal changes 70 . Your self is a system that takes input, or sensations, then processes that input using feedback loo ps. Most of these feedback loops (but not all of them) are operated by your brain, and eventually you out-put actions based on the input and the processing of that input. This is an analogy of one's self as a kind of black box. In order to change what you do and what happe ns as a result, there are three factors to consider experime nting with, and, of these, input is by far the easiest for you to effect, while the processing that transforms sensation into action is the hardest. One's output falls somewhere in between, as it is possible to convert sensation into action yet restrain oneself from performing that action through discipline. 70 We continue to promote collage work throughout this book because collage, by arranging pieces made of pre-existing media w ith a variety of materia ls into a new cohesive whole, is the same process of trimming, selecting, and arranging from v arious available sources that the br ain naturally utilizes to make sense of its environment as it develops. 136"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Begin by eliminating 71 sources of input that seem to exist purely to engage you with the hegemonic status quo. You may choo se to replace ordinary input with material fro m specific sources, and we also encourage you to spend at least some time creating your own media to extend your feedback loo ps into an externalized space. This brings us to the second factor, your output. You are constantly performing some sort of action, and as such are outputting signals constantly. What we suggest is spending at least some of that energy in the outputting of creatively producing a recorded me dia. There is an immediate power shift which occurs when you change from a passi ve media consumer to an act ive media producer. It doesn't matter if this media takes the form of drawings, music, text, video, or some other form of recorded expression, so long as it remains accessib le for you to experience as input at a point in the future. That said, it is better for this experime nt if what you are creat ing is as unstructured , as close to pure output as pos sible.

Do n't worry, you need not share this output with others if you don't want to - it is important that you periodically review these recordings. One of the best times to review this output is as input before you begin another creative session. This allows you to begin to get a grasp on the hardest factor to control, your processing of the input. In part, you have already started to do this by changing your input and feeding your output back into yourself. You can supplement this by learning various skills related to your for ms of expressio n. As mentioned elsewhere in this book, me dia criticism is an incredibly useful skill to pick up no matter what your area of creat ive expression and you will benefit from analyzing your output with this in mind.

Next, take each item and decide what single other factor on your list it leads into, keeping in mind that it is okay if some items have more than one factor leading to them.

As our conscious experience lags behind the events and actions of our lives, reality looks like an explana tion made up after the fact. However, a certain amount of life-as- game analogy does open up enorm ous possibilities for triggering change in the world 76 . When attempting to effect changes on others using memetic techniques, there are many layers of organization you can concentra te on, and many different angles of approach you can use. You could look at the linear causative structure of narrat ive, or instead focus on the underlying network structure of association. You could work with the cognitive layers of thought and em otion, or instead focus on preconscious dri ves and desires.

A meme needs to enter the human system by way of one of the senses. Its instructions mu st be encoded in a manner the nervous system can digest, and then act upon. For this we've appropriated NLP's representational systems of visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and olfactory channels. Most communication occurs beneath the layers of conscious thought because peo ple are only able to be conscious of a certa in percentage of the total sensory experience of any given moment in any given environ ment. Therefore, mo st of the information or input coming in along these various channels is being absorbed by the preconscious mind on a subliminal level. This knowledge provides a few tricks for tweaking a meme 's capsid to be more easily ingestible and infective. We could begin by changing linguistic or non-linguistic cues to lead the potential receiver through a sequence of sensory modalities, essentiall y training them in what NLP practi tioners term a 'strate gy.'

One's position in an officia l system of governance is only one measure of that indi vidual's politic al power. The totali ty of that individual's power can be figured by examining the lines of communication they can access and their abili ty to predict resp onses and reactions to their various transmitted signals along those communication lines. The overall political power of the individual then would be an estimate of that indi vidual's influence over the system of governance as a whole. This amount would change over time regardless of their official position in reference to the signals sent out by that individual or by other com ponents of the system in relation to that individual's signals.

Egregores are first and fore most emergent intelligen ces of an organization of people and the phy sical implements that carry out a specific egregore's directives.

A second layer of the egregore's manifestation is the network of relations between the people and the objects that make up the egregore, especially those lines of communication that exist.

In general, a communication is more powerfully affecting if it is grounded in experiential details. Describing the sights, sound s, smells, and other sensations of life brings a feeling of immediacy to any com municat ion. Except for specific purp oses where it is useful to be disassociative and abstra ct, you should include multi-sensory details in all of your signals 85 . The point of your signal is to affect react ion in your audience, to insert your experiences into their consciousness so that your desires then become theirs. Your art and output is not sim ply a matter of self expression when you are engaged in magical acts , it's more than a representation: it precipitates action. Kn owing who your audience is and what they want is the first step toward getting that audience to take the action you want them to take. In this vein, let’s examine the example of the bread store that just went out of busine ss.

A board or placa rd advertising specials to the street would have also helped transmit signals to tho se nearby that there were innovative products inside for special prices. These kinds of ideas can be abstra cted into any system or pattern, injecting flexible behavior where otherwise entropy might stifle growth. By setting your will out in a form that you can refer to, by externalizing it in a real and concrete way, you have initia ted a sequence of associative triggers. To fulfill your will, your job is to follow these trigger associations through the paths of synchronicity that they indicate, and act on these triggers. If your intentions are positive, then following these triggers will bring more positive change. Of course, the opposite is true as well, and it takes tremendous energy to sto p a negative intention fro m manifesting.

You don 't need to force it to grow upwards, but you do need to give it a nudge here and there and provide it with a structure on which to climb. In the same way, you need to know what me mes already inhabit a social space 86 and how to leverage your meme s off of those existing meme s across the communication network for your intentions to come to fruition. Just like internal psychic work, the primary comp onent for effective evolutionary progressi on is the inclusion of a factor of mem ory or recording. This recording must be partial and over-writab le, to allow for a kind of per petual flux. There is an inherent power in behavioral flexibility that comes with understanding that a 86 Both pub lic and counter- public spheres of discourse are social spaces, even subaltern groups h ave their own internal networks that influence the larger soci al spheres.

Linguistic training can help you learn a new way of internal and external expressio n and with each different language come correspondingly different assum ptions and limitat ions. Often an initiatory experience carries with it the adapta tion of a new set of language, and with it a new sense of possible appr oaches to any given problem.

Such subaltern counterpublic spheres of discourse also serve as a similar memetic pool as mastermind group s, although they exist as a result of marginali zation by the public sphere rather than as a result of deliberate formation. In these instances, private language tends toward as objective a description as possible of what is being defined. Both the metamodel of NLP 88 as described by John Grinder and Richard Bandler and E-Prime as described by David Bourland, Jr 89 , are examples of private language used as technology.

The manipulation of symbols then takes place both within the mind of the magician, as well as within the time stream of the physical and the shadow time wherein abstr act ions change. Thus, to con struct a ritual in physicali ty is the same as construct ing one within one's con scious awareness - and creat ing symb ols acts to prepare the min d for the use of those symbols. Your consciousness is the altar of the temple of yourself, and you have to figure out what symbolic forms hold meaning for you within that temple structure . 209"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"II. Traffic Dragon While I don’t necessarily fall under the aegis of the term pantheist I do tend to see life or intelligence at play all ov er the place. I tend to posit a kind of emergent intelligen ce in systems of sufficient complexity. The city itself is certa inly complex enough for emergent properties to take on a semblance of intelligence. Additionally traffic takes on this kind of com plexity. The different kinds of intera cting comp onents in the system of traffi c includes cars, the roads, traffic lights, the weather conditions, pede strians crossing streets, and so forth. Traffic is a system that communicates in terms of speeds and timing. Clearly if Traffic has awareness it does n ot think in human terms. Delays can propagate very quickly through the system. As each car slows earlier in sequence than the one in front of it the car at the end of a line must brake quickest and go slowest. If any car brakes later in sequence than the one in 210"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"front of it, it crashes into it. This slow down tends to be more total. Groups of cars will also tend to clump and group as close together as possible while avoiding impacts and then a gap and another clump. Reading the traffic system is largely going to be about the behaviour of cars. Looking at the speed they are traveling, looking at the relative density and clumpiness of the traffic flow. Most lights are relatively fixed features ignoring the pedestrian controlled crossing. To start working with Traffic you start by watching it. Fin d a place where two busy streets interact or maybe where the regular road system meets the highways. Watch it. Watch it at various times of day so that you see varying repeated patterns. Learn to feel the difference between rush hour, weekdays, weekends, and the middle of the night. Find ot her places to wat ch traffic from. Look for what stays the same what changes depending on changes in time or location. What you are trying to do is internalize the language of the streets. Don’t try to look for words, traffic may not be speaking at that high of level of complexity. Try to learn how to feel the MOOD of traffic . Not the mood of people in traffi c but the mood of the beast itself. Once you feel like you can read the mood of traffic its time to try to talk to it. In order to talk to it you nee d to place yourself where you can have an effect on it and read the 211"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"react ion. My suggestion is a pedestrian controlled traffic light that changes rather quickly. The quicker it changes the closer you can control the timing. As the effect of your triggering the crossing will create delays behind the cars that stop for the light, you can wat ch for the changes where you are. I do suggest you cross the street if you used the signal. It seems disres pectful to do otherwise and you don’t wish to draw ire fro m people in the cars you have sto pped. Try to vary the timing of your signaling. Spend all day there saying “Hi.” Look for patterns and differences in the effect or respon se to your signal. An other way to talk to traffic is to get in a car and enter the system. This allows for much richer signaling on your part than the binary switch of the crosswalk. However this places you as much more subject to the system of traffic. If you have gotten the atten tion of the traffic 212"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"dragon, if you have angered the beast this might be a dangerous time for you. My suggestion is to drive around the streets with no direction or schedule in mind. This will allow you to see a wider range of street conditions and frankly if traffic has noticed you, getting to anywhere on time may be difficult . During this time it might be a good idea to use the car only for com municat ing with traffic and use public transportation if you need to get anywhere. Up to this point we’ve been acting as if all cars are the same. Common sense tells us of course that they are not. Emergency vehicles are an interesting special case, they have greater effect on traffic conditions than it generally 213"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"has on them because the law legislates that other vehicles must get out of their way. However, the emergency vehicles can be summ oned by traffic when a vehicular collision occurs. Another special case is that of public transit vehicles. They have a set path through the networks of roads and should in general have a consistent effect on the traffic around them and could operate as a system clock to show how much the traffic is slowing down their predictab le circuits . The traffic dragon has millions of little sen se organs, they are called drivers. The nervous system of car drivers includes the ability to recognize certain types of vehicles and to discern colours. Try watching traffic for certain colour or colour combinations. The more you watch traffic the more you will see intelligent acts of sortilege; creations of patterns that you can read and interpret. The purpose of the foregoing work was to build up an adequate model of traffic behaviour in your brain. Once you have done this there are many other ways to access the traffi c entity. An important step to take is to start acting or thinking about traffic as if it is a person or perso n like. The reason for this is we have much more brain circuitry availa ble when we are thinking about people or people like things than we do if we seem them as inanimate. Asperger’s Syndrome folk may find the other way around 214"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"easier. For assistance for reading the mood of the roads, is to after looking at the conditions visualize the face and body language the traffic dragon would be making. In general it will be easier to read the mo od of this visualiza tion than the streets themselves. If you have built up an adequate model of traffic operations in your brain, you will find your traffic face to give you very useful information. 215"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"III. Memetics for the Artist We titled this book The Art of Memetics, and it see ms only right to end on a way for artists to apply memetics in a concrete way. If you are an artist , one of the most imp ortant questions you’ll face is this: How do you go about deciding where to promote your art? To begin, you might want to now go online, and check into a few different social networks. Obviou sly the biggest has been Myspace for some time, but other social networks also exist, each with their own benefits and flaws. I wouldn't tell you to go onto a social network and attempt to pro mote your work if I hadn't already seen the results it can bring. Figure out what you're looking to promote, and what is it that helps you know whether you are being successful. 216"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Artists have different motivations. You might be seeking simply to spread your work, be it traditional painting, music, photography, sculpture, or video work. Obviously different social networks can handle different media, some more effectively than others. If you' ve got a huge stockpile of homemade vide o, getting a youtube account , a google video account, perhaps a metacafe account and a lulu.tv account makes more sen se than getting a flickr account. On the other hand, if you rely on photos of your work or digital imagery in your art, then having a flickr account , a picasawe b account, and a deviantart account are very imp ortant . You don't have to rely on these types of sites if you have your own server space or web site where you' ve showcased your work, yet you should still con sider using the m as they allow you to tap into an already existing network, while your personal web site relies on search engine traffic and your own marketing efforts to bring in site traffic . Why is it that some artists break through into the art world and others are left trying to get by without any notice? If you' ve read the book up through until now, you probably can intuit the answer. It's due to public awareness, awareness within the right networks, the networks that are already enabled to sup port an artist, whatever their medium. 217"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"I don't know if you' ve read the full book, but even if you' ve just skimme d it and are reading the appendix, or if someone's marked out these passages for you to glance at, I can still help you take your work and put it in the right place to generate more interest. Would you like to see your paintings hanging in a gallery , get your films shown to a vast number of people, or hear your music on the local stations? Perhaps you want to be able to get your craf ts into auction sites online, or you want to see how it feels to have peo ple around the world experience a sculpture you 've made, or a story you' ve written . Some peo ple hang onto this desire without acting upon it, precisely because they're uncert ain of how to begin. If you could have hundreds or thou sands of people engaging with your work, experiencing your art, why would you let uncertain ty be a barrier? If you would choose to spend your time researching a few options, within a couple of weeks you 'd have found the right social networks online to start growing awareness of your creative talents.
