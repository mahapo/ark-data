Persuasion began with physical coercion. The bigger and stronger you were, the more people you were able to persuade. Soon mere strength was superseded by skill. More proficient fighters defeated hulks through nim ble and deft action. But persuasion was still based on physical force, albeit a more skilled force. Those with greater physical might and expertise were able to persuade those with less of the same. Weaponry evolved persuasion further and those with be tter arms (first sticks and stones, then spears and slings, then bows and arrows...), as well as those skilled with such arms, succeeded in persuading those with less. As man rapidly developed ever - increasing communicative sophistication, sheer force was o ccasionally replaced (or outwitted with) first by simple trading, later, through bargaining and deal making. Over the development of early civilization, as enlightened quid - pro - quo trade arrangements become more of the norm, the weapons of physical for ce were gradually replaced by the weapons of the mind and tongue. Those who had more refined thinking and speaking skills were able to more effectively persuade those with less of the same. Throughout the evolution of civilization, power has taken on many forms and exists in different ways all over the world today. Plain old power, manifesting in forms such as physical, political and social power, held by governments, leaders, positions, parents and school yard bullies continues to persuade, and alway s will. But the power of thoughts and words has become equally commanding, often succeeding traditional power, and the influence it carries, in our lives. The study of the power of words, and the manner in which those words are spoken, to influence our fellow man has continued to emerge as an area of acute interest to those who recognize its might, as well as their selfish potential for gain, through the mastery of the tools of verbal persuasion. We do not know if those who attempt to sell us one their ideas, products, services, ideals, or beliefs are genuine in their cause, or if they are tricksters . It may not matter (for the sake of the purpose of this work) because the opposing party views the passionate political leader of one party as a swindler. The champion, top - producing salesperson of a company, revered by both management and his peers, may be exposed as a defrauding con artist by an investigative,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 5 consumer advocate reporter. Often, success with the power of verbal persuasion is a relative t erm. It depends entirely whether you are on the giving or receiving end. Nonetheless, the pure trickster — the out - and - out con artist, the dishonest cheater, is always found out. Sometimes sooner, sometimes later, but the trickster who intentionally swind les and misleads others is ALWAYS discovered. ALWAYS. And the trickster never lasts. No matter what tools of influence he (or she) uses, they get found out. People catch on to their games and their ways. So they must change games, and jobs, and cons, and move to different towns, because they sell what they cannot deliver. And it’s such a waste! If they would only speak the truth, what awesome results they could achieve through their persuasive skill! Ralph Waldo Emerson so eloquently summed it al l up when he said, “Who you are shouts so loudly in my ears that I cannot hear what you are saying.” Who you are is so much more important than what you are trying to accomplish. And who you are always shines through. Regardless of how you attempt to pe rsuade others it is your inner motive that carries the most weight. If you do not believe in what you are selling, or if you believe it is not in the best interest of those you are trying to influence, you will not achieve long - lasting success. If your intentions are from the heart, genuine and pure, Covert Hypnosis, along with the many other tools and techniques of persuasion will serve you well, in the short and long terms.

This fictitious person interrupts you while you are try ing to finish a sentence, talks over you when you try to make a point, and criticizes your every suggestion. You don’t know anyone like this, do you? Your various conscious, overt attempts to temper your boss’ impolite and toxic treatment (such as stan ding up for your self and “feeding back” your responses to him (or her) in the same style and tone of voice he uses) have gotten you nowhere. In fact, such attempts at pointing out or “correcting” his nasty behavior have stirred the waters even further, a nd made you even more concerned about your relationship with your boss. What if you could “secretly” hypnotize your boss, during a seemingly normal, innocent conversation, and unconsciously persuade this ogre (or ogress as the case may be) into treating y ou properly? This is possible using the art of Covert Hypnosis. What if you were having problems with your teenage son who has begun to hang around with new friends — friends who are less than desirable? Your attempts to persuade your son to stop associa ting with these undesirables, and seek new friendships have flat - out failed. You have tried everything you know how to do, and gotten nowhere. What if you could tell your son a story, perhaps a series of stories over several weeks, and within these stori es, covertly hypnotize him, offering “irresistible” new choices that...suddenly become his own ideas. And then, a few weeks later, your son suddenly decides that he’s through with his old friends and has discovered a couple of new buddies to hang out with. Friends that have the kinds of attitudes and values that you consider good. Wouldn’t you like to be able to do this? Just imagine the possibilities of the awesome power of Covert Hypnosis. Maybe you are involved in a business of your own. Maybe you are contemplating starting a business. If either case is true for you, you will have to successfully market your product or service. You will have to convince people that what you are selling is what they should buy. Wouldn’t you like to be able to use hypnosis with your clients — and soon - to - be clients — to influence them to buy from you NOW? Persuasion gets so much easier when you use powerful covert methods, and they have no idea that you are doing it!"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 8 Perhaps you are interviewing for a great new posit ion; a new job that offers tremendous opportunity for doing exactly what you want to do, with excellent pay, great benefits, and all the perks you’ve dreamed of. The problem is, your competition is stiff. Wouldn’t you like to gain a competitive edge over the other candidates by secretly hypnotizing your prospective employer and planting suggestions in his or her mind that you are the one for the job, and that they must offer you the job? Maybe it’s your wife* that you’re interested in secretly hypnotizin g. Wouldn’t it be very cool to be able to hypnotize your wife and plant secret suggestions in her subconscious mind that induce immediate, incredible, and irresistible passion? Or delight and fascination? Or spontaneity and excitement? Perhaps you’re m ore interested in using Covert Hypnosis to help you and your wife to just stop arguing now , and instead, focus your energy on seeking out realistic solutions for the challenges you face. The applications are literally endless, and as you begin to really learn the tools and techniques of this powerful art, your unconscious mind will begin to discover many wonderful uses of Covert Hypnosis to help you influence people and events in your life. The tools you are about to be exposed to will allow you to do so me truly amazing things, provided to take the time and put forth the necessary effort needed to first learn the core concepts. Then practice them until you have absorbed their basic structure, and finally, persist until you have achieved mastery. If you d o these things, you will develop an entirely new set of very powerful skills that will serve you well, in all aspects of your life. (*Or husband, boyfriend, girlfriend or partner!)

Such methods put the onus of trance induction on the hypnotist and, quite often, both the hypnotist and the subject believe the hypnotist is the one controlling the experience. This, of course, is rarely true. Most people are unwilling, or very f earful of, anyone else trying to “control” them, or even allow another to induce an altered state in them. Some people may say they are willing subjects, but usually part of them is quite unwilling to relinquish control. It is this issue of control — or g iving up control — which creates so much resistance in the traditional approaches to hypnotizing others. You may or may not be familiar with how traditional hypnotic inductions are structured. If you are, here’s a brief review. If you’re not, here’s a cr ash course in how most hypnotists approach hypnotic induction. There are innumerable variations to this somewhat generic outline, but in general, this is the essence of the traditional methodology. The hypnotist usually has the subject sit in a chair an d asks them to sit comfortably with their feet planted squarely on the floor, and their hands resting on their lap. The subject is then told to relax, and asked to stare at an imaginary spot on the floor or wall. The hypnotist tells the subject to conti nue looking at the spot, to continue staring at that spot, and as they do, they will begin to feel their eyes get heavier and heavier, heavier and heavier. And, the hypnotist continues, as the subject’s eyes get heavier and heavier, they begin to get slee pier and sleepier...eyes heavier...feeling sleepier and sleepier...deeper and deeper and deeper... All the while the hypnotist speaks in a monotone, low voice. The suggestions for sleepiness and eye closure continue for at least ten minutes, often more like twe nty to twenty - five minutes. Frequently, suggestions are given for relaxation, starting at the top of the subject’s head and working down through all major muscle groups of their body, with suggestions for sleepiness and eye closure interspersed. For exa mple, the hypnotist will say, “The muscles around your head and neck are beginning to feel so relaxed...so loose and limp...so very much at ease...going deeper and deeper. Now your left shoulder is beginning to feel so relaxed...so loose and limp...and your eyes ar e continuing to become even heavier and heavier... This continues all the way down"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 11 throughout the subject’s body until all major muscle groups have been relaxed. In most cases, the hypnotist subjectively determines whether the subject is hypnotized. How do you know if a person is actually hypnotized? Well, that depends on how you define hypnosis. We will take a look at this interesting subject in the next chapter. Some hypnotists use tests to determine if the hypnotic state has been induced. Other hypn otists use tests to determine “how deep” their subject is. These tests include suggestions for arm levitation, eye catalepsy, arm catalepsy, regression, amnesia, and others. If the subject responds to a specific suggestion, they get a certain score on on e of several hypnotic depth scales, such as the Davis - Husband Scale, or the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale. According to traditional methods, if the subject does not respond adequately to the tests, that is, they don’t get the minimum score requir ed to be considered “officially hypnotized” the hypnotist may continue the induction, possible trying different techniques. Sometimes the hypnotist will “dismiss” the subject telling them they are “not responding” or that they are not capable of being hyp notized. The concept that a person is not responding is, in my opinion, a reflection on the hypnotist, not the subject. If a hypnotist is unable to induce a trance in a subject it’s more likely a signal that the hypnotist lacks flexibility in his approa ch and is not sensitive to altering his methods to fit what works for that unique subject. The idea that a person is not capable of being hypnotized is, in my opinion, absurd. Everyone can be hypnotized. If the hypnotist is skilled enough and has an ad equately diverse set of approaches, they can hypnotize anyone. If all a hypnotist knows is one or two techniques, they will only be able to hypnotize the subjects that happen to respond to those techniques. It is fair to say that everyone responds diffe rently to hypnosis, and it is impossible to determine who will respond quickly and who will take some time to hypnotize. Some individuals are highly susceptible to hypnotic influence; others are highly resistant. Those who are readily hypnotizable can dr op into trance literally in a few short minutes — even on the very first induction attempt. After several sessions of progressively deep hypnosis, these “somnambulists” can often be hypnotized in seconds using rapid induction techniques. If you are interes ted in studying the fascinating techniques of rapid induction hypnosis, additional resources are listed in Chapter 19 of this book. Those subjects that are not amenable to trance induction in a relatively short period or time, and those that seem complet ely unhypnotizeable, require more effort, greater variety of approach, and persistence on the part of the hypnotist. Milton Erickson, the famed Medical hypnotherapist and creator of the indirect approach to hypnosis, is reported to have said that he on ce spent over 300 hours trying to hypnotize one highly resistant subject. Always remember that whether you’re using traditional methods or advanced covert techniques, persistence defies resistance. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 12 Susceptibility and Depth Testing In Traditional Hypnosis The idea of susceptibility tests and depth scales is, in my opinion, highly limiting. These tests use rigid criteria based on limited techniques. Who says a person must demonstrate eye catalepsy in order to be considered “lightly” hypnotized? Is the re any “rule” that says a person must exhibit eye catalepsy? None that I’m aware of. And even if there was, who made up the rule? And who says it makes sense, or is accurate, or is right? As you will learn throughout your study of hypnosis, many of t he standards for defining hypnosis and measuring the depth of hypnosis are totally and completely “made up” by people who arbitrarily developed definitions and scales that they deemed appropriate. They might think that their definitions and scales are “a ccurate”, “right” and “true”, but in reality, they are simply estimations and opinions at best. A Silly Comparison That Illustrates The Subjective Nature of Hypnotic Scales and Tests Such arbitrary assignment is comparable to someone creating a “Pot Roast Acceptability Scale” that would list, in a very official looking format, the qualities necessary for a pot roast to be considered acceptable. We could call this the P.R.A.S., and it would delineate the proper temperature, color, consistency, and tas te needed for a pot roast to be acceptable, i.e., delicious and suitable for serving to family and guests. We could publish the P.R.A.S. in cookbooks, cooking journals, cuisine magazines, and stand behind this “standard” with resolute conviction that pot roast absolutely positively MUST meet the criteria of the P.R.A.S. in order to be designated as valid and bonafide. What if enough credible people in the world of cooking, e.g. long established cooks and chefs, editors of magazines, etc., buy in to the c oncept of the P.R.A.S. and consider it to be “right” and “true”? Over time, the P.R.A.S. becomes the accepted standard. But there is a problem. What if you don’t like pot roast made according to the requirements of the P.R.A.S.? What if you simply don ’t like the way pot roast tastes when it’s made according to the P.R.A.S.? What if you don’t “positively respond” to a dinner made in accordance with this scale? What if you object to it? Does that make your opinion wrong? Or is the scale wrong? The point I’m trying to make with this ridiculous example is that all of the hypnotic scales that are out there in the literature on hypnosis — and there is a massive amount of it — those scales ARE MADE UP by some individual who decided “this is the way it should be”. THEY MADE IT UP!!! Is there any scientific evidence that a person must exhibit eye catalepsy in order to legitimately be in a light trance? No. If you read of such evidence I suggest that you challenge it."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 13 Question all of the models that offer “ proof” and “evidence”. Challenge, question, debate, investigate and explore. But don’t accept “facts” just because they are given to you in a neatly organized table with footnotes, by someone with the letters “Ph.D.” after their name. Because if you do, you will likely buy in to a limited model of how things are supposed to be. Accept no limitations. Accept only the results you can produce by exploring, trying new things, and constantly asking yourself, “What would happen if I tried it this way...” You’l l be surprised at what delightful discoveries you’ll make. How Covert Hypnosis is Radically Different Where traditional approaches to hypnosis often use fixed techniques, rigid models and susceptibility scales to induce trance states, Covert Hypnosis t eaches you to customize your hypnotic induction to the unique human being you are hypnotizing. Any every human being is unique. That’s why, when you use Covert Hypnosis methods, every single induction will be different — specific to the person you are hypn otizing. Don’t be concerned that you will need to learn thousands of different inductions, because you won’t. You will learn a handful of very powerful tools that you will pick and choose from with each person you hypnotize. Each tool can be used in dif ferent ways. You will learn how to use each tool and when. Covert Hypnosis grows from the roots of Ericksonian - style approaches. I say Ericksonian “style” because there are numerous different models of Milton Erickson’s work. Earnest Rossi, William Hudson O’Hanlon, John Grinder and Richard Bandler, and Jay Haley are just a few of the many who have written on Erickson’s unique approach to hypnosis. If you were to read one book by each of these authors you would begin to see the difference in their un derstanding of Erickson’s philosophy and methods. You would also see a difference in the style of each author’s teaching. My development of the model of Covert Hypnosis was inspired by the work of Milton Erickson and has been influenced by many authors and teachers in the field of hypnosis. Erickson was the first practitioner of hypnosis, that I am aware of, to use indirect hypnotic approaches. Many others have further developed and expanded indirect techniques and the indirect approach is now becoming a recognized style of hypnosis and hypnotherapy, especially within the clinical world. Covert Hypnosis is different from indirect hypnosis in the crucial aspect that Covert Hypnosis is intentionally surreptitious. Most practitioners of indirect hypnosi s do not keep it a secret that they are attempting to hypnotize their subject. Therefore, the use of indirect hypnosis has usually been in a clinical setting with a subject who wants to be hypnotized and who is aware they are going to be hypnotized. The purpose of using indirect approaches is usually to decrease or bypass resistance to the traditional methods of trance induction. With Covert Hypnosis, your subject is not aware of your hypnotic techniques. Covert Hypnosis is a clandestine art. It is fo r this reason that Covert Hypnosis can be used — and in fact is already being used — in negotiations, sales transactions, religious proselytism, advertisements,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 14 court rooms, debates, and all other kinds of persuasive endeavors.

Ask ten hypnotists, or hypnotherapists, to give you a definition of hypnosis, hypnotism, or the hypnotic state and you will get ten different answers. Possibly ten completely different answers. This is because there is no universally accepted definition of hypnosis. If you look up the word hypnosis in the dictionary you will read something along the lines of “a sleep - like state”, or “to be in a state that resembles sleep”. Most hypnotists thou gh will disagree with the contention that hypnosis has anything to do with sleep. Many hypnotists will tell you that hypnosis is the opposite of sleep, a heightened state of acute awareness. Some hypnotists have talked about hypnosis as “an altered stat e of consciousness”, or “a state that is neither full consciousness nor full unconsciousness”. These are very vague descriptions of a state that has no agreed upon definition. The problem, of course is that if you can’t define it, how do you know when it is or is not present? There are the tests we discussed earlier that are supposed to help you discern if a subject is hypnotized. But, as I pointed out, those tests are arbitrarily created and do not necessarily prove anything. Besides, how can you pro ve that something is present when you can’t define it? Many people base their belief about what hypnosis is, or should be, on what they have been exposed to on television and in the movies. You’ve probably seen shows where a hypnotist, wearing a black o utfit, a goatee, and slicked - back hair, swings a pendulum and says to his (it’s never a woman, is it?) subject, “Look into my eyes...you are getting sleepy...very sleepy ”, and in a matter of moments, the subject drops into a profound trance, with their body c ompletely limp. The subject then proceeds to follow the every instruction of the often - evil hypnotist. When the subject awakens, the have no recollection of the events that took place while they were “under” the hypnotist’s spell. This fantastical port rayal of hypnosis has given hypnosis a bad name — and has also perpetuated the mystique of and many of the myths about hypnosis. Rarely if ever does hypnosis occur the way they show it on TV. However, there are aspects of what is shown that are accurate. Some people do in fact “drop into trance” in a matter of moments. Most do not “drop” that quickly. Some people do go completely limp and let their arms drop to their sides and their heads tilt forward; many don’t, though. Some people do “come out” of trance with absolutely zero recollection of what took place while they were hypnotized. Typically only a very small percentage of people experience total amnesia. A larger percentage experience partial amnesia. And even more people remember everything t hat happened while they were in trance. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 17 Are you now thoroughly confused about what hypnosis is? It is confusing, and much of what you decide to believe comes down to opinion based on your personal experience and what you choose to buy in to. For eve ry claim, statement or “fact” about hypnosis you can probably find hundreds of people to agree with that claim, statement or “fact”. And you can also find just as many people who will adamantly disagree with it as well. Such controversy is not limited to hypnotism. Most fields have within their circles an abundance of disagreement, debate and dissension. This is often how new branches of a specific field are created. The student learns from the teacher, thinking the teacher is absolutely brilliant an d infallible . Later, the student has a revelation, insight, or breakthrough that leads him to realize the teacher is way off track! Student and teacher debate, argue, and eventually part ways, and the student goes off to create a new field, theory or di scipline. This is common. What has always amazed me, however, is that peers often disagree about “facts”, “truth” and “what is right”. I once did some editing work on a book by a neurologist who believed absolutely and unequivocally in the “unipolar ” approach to diagnosing epilepsy. For years this man, a medical doctor, argued with dissenting colleagues that the unipolar method was the way to diagnose epilepsy — the right way, and the only proper way. This man was a prominent and respected researcher and a leader in the “unipolar” faction. Another faction, also medical doctors, vehemently disagreed with this man. Their “bipolar” approach was the only “true and correct way”. Ultimately, the bipolar folks won out, and it is this method that is commo nly used today. But the man who first developed the unipolar approach went to his grave believing in it — and believing that the bipolar folks were crazy. What absolutely astounded me, as a young editor, was that this debate of unipolar and bipolar approa ches was between highly educated and respected men! It took me a while to begin to understand that controversy is everywhere. Perhaps more so in the sciences than anywhere. The same is true in our legal system. Have you ever served jury duty? I’ve be en called to serve jury duty twice, and actually served once. I was 19 years old and very excited, albeit intimidated, about participating in our nation’s legal process. I looked forward to learning about the legal system and understanding just what goes on inside a courtroom. I was also looking forward to participating in a decision for justice. Assuming the case would be “cut and dried”, I figured that making a “just” decision would be simple and easy. After all, facts are facts, right? Wrong. Bei ng a juror turned out to be one of the most frustrating, painful and eye - opening experiences of my young life. I was incredibly surprised at the way “justice” was very hard to figure out. And what amazed me the most was the way both attorneys (plaintiff and defense) claimed that their client was absolutely, unequivocally, and certainly in the right. Both attorneys also stated that their opposition was absolutely, unequivocally and certainly wrong. There was no room for compromise. There was no middle o f the road. They were right and the “other” was wrong. And they both felt this way."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 18 What I soon realized was this wasn’t about justice. This wasn’t about right and wrong. It was all about winning. And both attorneys were out for blood. They would use every single method, approach, technique, tactic and the like to get the judge and jury to agree that they were right and the other side was wrong. They did not care about compromise, about gray areas, or about separating truth from lies. They only care d about winning. The opinion I developed through this experience is that trial law is about two things: persuasion and winning -- nothing else. If asked, “Do you really believe that your client is right?” Virtually all attorneys will publicly respond, “Absolutely”. In private, to a close and trusted friend, I suggest that often the answer would be very different. Why is this so in our legal system today? I believe the primary reason is because so many lawyers value winning, and the money that comes with winning more than they value truth. They did not get into law to serve justice; they got into law for the money, the prestige, and all the trappings that go with. Now their clients may believe, some of the time, that they are right, because of thei r deep conviction in their cause — whatever it is. This, of course, does not mean that they are truly “right”. Every single legal battle has two opposing sides. Both claim to be right. Both claim the other to be wrong. This happens every day — thousands o f times — across America. Every legal case comes replete with a preponderance of evidence (from both sides) designed to prove the accurateness of the party’s claims. Expert witnesses giving expert testimony, “scientific” reports, physical evidence, photog raphs, charts, pictures, etc. are offered, all designed to “prove” that “they” are right and the other is wrong. Facts are fact, right? Wrong. Experts disagree, evidence is challenged and accused of being “contaminated”, the character of key witnesses is attacked, and “scientific” reports are picked apart, with holes poked in their integrity. And the result? Frequently, confusion on the part of the jurors. Whom do you believe? Which expert is right? Which is wrong? What about hidden agendas? Ul terior motives? Often jurors don’t know whom to side with and end up making a decision on emotion, not the facts. Some jurors get so frustrated that they don’t care whom wins, or who is right, and go along with the decision a dominant juror has made. So me jurors are naturally leaders. Others are followers. Some have very strong beliefs and convictions. Others do not. Some jurors feel very good about the decision they made. Others do not. What’s my point about all of this, and what does it have to do with hypnosis? Controversy. I want to make clear that controversy is as much a part of hypnosis as it is a part of law. Or medicine. Or any other field often associated with strong beliefs and “facts”. If you were to simply accept one of the many definitions of hypnosis that are out there (as many, many people have — they don’t question what they are told, they just accept it as “fact”)"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 19 your understanding of hypnosis would be simple. But if you are like me, and challenge assertions, try to “pin dow n” specifics, and attempt to find proof of specific claims, you would, like me, see that there is tremendous controversy, ambiguity and mystification in the field known as hypnosis. And that’s a good understanding to have. Why? Because it means you ar e thinking for yourself, and not just accepting what some “expert” or “authority” said. I encourage you to challenge the ideas of others. Question their assertions. Debate their fundamental assumptions. Ask them to prove their main points with verifiab le evidence. When they give you proof, challenge it. Play devil’s advocate and make them stand behind their claims — not just with conviction that comes with arbitrary belief, but with evidence. Doing so will help you learn more than you ever imagined — abo ut the subject you are studying, and about yourself. Timothy Leary told me years ago, “Think for yourself and question authority”. (I had the good fortune of spending the better part of a day with Dr. Leary back in 1987 when he came to the university I was attending to speak. I was on the Speakers’ Forum Committee and drove several hours to pick him up. We had quite an interesting conversation during the three - hour ride back to campus.) Anyway, If I learned anything from Leary it was to question the assertions made by others, especially those that claim to be “experts” or “authorities” on any given subject. Many alleged authorities are simply caught up in their narrow way of thinking. They cannot see outside of their own reality. S - T - R - E - T - C - H you r mind and strive to understand many different perspectives on any issue and it will help you to become more creative and more philosophical about learning, knowledge, truth and life. And with the many different theories, approaches, understandings and mi s - understandings in the field of hypnosis, stretching your thinking faculties will be extremely useful. A Useful Working Definition “The Amazing Kreskin” has a definition of hypnosis that is, in my opinion, is the best one to come along yet. Kreskin ha s said that hypnosis does not exist -- that its existence is a myth. In his book Secrets of the Amazing Kreskin , he states, “hypnosis is persuasion to accept a suggestion”. That is a very insightful, well thought out and accurate definition. What I belie ve Kreskin means by that definition is that the “trance state” often believed to be associated with “hypnosis” is in fact completely separate from hypnosis, and has nothing to do with hypnosis. In other words, when a person is “hypnotized” they are simpl y following your suggestions. You have persuaded them to do what you say. Whether or not they experience anything that may be interpreted as being a “trance” (partial or total amnesia, the appearance of being unconscious, looking like a “zombie” etc.) is irrelevant. According to Kreskin, “hypnosis” does not exist. What people refer to as “hypnosis” is nothing more than persuasion or influence. And the people you “hypnotize” are simply"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 20 following your suggestions because of the “faith/prestige” relatio nship that you have established with them. Kreskin is so confidant that hypnosis does NOT exist that he has a standing offer of $100,000 open to anyone whom can prove that there is such a thing as the hypnotic state. Kreskin makes reference to this offer in his book, but doesn’t go into the details of the offer. Small print at the bottom of a photograph says that anyone who wants to go for the $100,000 must prove their case to a committee of scientists and meet certain criteria. Exactly what that means, I’m not sure, but I assume that the committee is, has been, or will be selected by Kreskin and the criteria will also be determined by Kreskin. Which is perfectly fair. After all, it is his hundred grand! Whether or not it can be proven that hypnosis d oes or does not exist is not the point of this book. That would be like trying to prove that one religion is right and all of the others are wrong. Such debates are highly personal, highly subjective, and very philosophical — and nobody ever wins. Thousa nds of people worldwide practice hypnosis today, and they believe it exists. And I believe it exists also. At least in the sense that hypnosis is communication directed specifically at the subconscious mind (also known as the “unconscious” or “other - than - conscious”). So, in conclusion of this discussion of “what is hypnosis, anyway?” you really will have to come to terms with your own belief about what hypnosis is and how to define it. I will leave you with my two favorite definitions of hypnosis. The first, which we’ve already discussed, is Kreskin’s: “Hypnosis is persuasion to accept a suggestion.” Kreskin makes no reference or distinction to the persuasion being directed to the subconscious or the conscious mind (at least not in anything I have read from Kreskin). Perhaps to him such a distinction is not necessary. The other definition is this: “Hypnosis is the use of unique suggestions to elicit unique responses.” Most often, hypnotists use suggestion to induce states of mind that make a p erson more amenable to further suggestion. That is the goal, whether using traditional or covert methods. Additionally, most hypnotists endeavor to direct their subject’s thought focus inward and communicate directly with the subject’s subconscious mind . The goal it to distract the conscious mind and avoid the resistance often given by the conscious mind.

If your subject doesn’t know you are hypnotizing them, you automatically bypass all conscious resistance to your hypnotic induction and suggestions. Instead of you tel ling them what you want them to do (telling people what to do often elicits resistance. Nobody likes to be told what to do.) you engage their imagination and use hypnotic techniques to make the idea seem irresistible. Your ideas, indirectly implanted thr ough Covert hypnosis, surface in their consciousness as their ideas.

You will likely want to read this entire book from beginning to end. Doing so will give you knowledge of the concepts. It won’t, however, make you good at using them. If you really want to become adept at using these tools, do it one technique at a time, first understanding the tool conceptually, then rehearsing the use of the tool consciously, and finally practicing the specific technique many times every day for an entire week. Do not succumb to the temptation to try and do it all at once. It is far more effective to master one tool at a time. If you do that, all of the pieces will come together quite naturally, without you even havin g to think about it. It’s much like learning the letters of the alphabet. Way back when you were a young child and you first learned the letters of the alphabet, it seemed like such a difficult task. To try and tell the difference between a d and a b . To know the difference between a c and an — it all seemed so large and complex. But soon, through much rehearsal and diligence, you began to form permanent images in your subconscious mind that stayed with you all of your life. And because you made the effort to learn the entire alphabet really thoroughly , one letter at a time, putting them all together to form words and sentences comes quite easily and automatically. Once you learn the pieces, inside and out, backwards and forwards, they stay with you... forever. And you can call on them at will, consciously and unconsciously; they are always there. Learning Covert Hypnosis is exactly like learning the alphabet. Learning each tool is like learning one letter. Pay the price, do the hard work or practic e, repetition, and memorization once, and you will OWN the techniques for a lifetime. And it’s so much easier if you give yourself a full week with each technique. Integrate each tool into your automatic processes. Build an intuition about how and when each tool is best used. This comes from thorough understanding and practice. You may find that listening to each technique is a powerful way to learn. Hearing the sounds, the specific voice inflections, the verbal patterns, over and over again, is an e xcellent way to learn for many people. Try recording your own voice as you practice each technique of Covert Hypnosis. Listen to the tape over and over again while you get ready for work or while doing light chores around the house. Hearing the techniqu es repeatedly will allow them to become absorbed into you unconscious allowing you to learn them automatically. This is a great way to enhance your learning of any subject."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 25 Another excellent way to rapidly learn Covert Hypnosis is to get a set of our Cov ert Hypnosis Home Study Course tapes. More information on this program is listed in the last chapter of this book. I can’t make you learn. All I can do is suggest a format for accelerated and in depth absorption of new knowledge. So here it is again: Learn, study and use one technique per week. The following chapters reveal the nuts and bolts of the Covert Techniques. To make your learning more effective (and easy), exercises are included at the end of each chapter.

This chapter will explain each specific tool, i.e., what it is, how it works. Subsequent chapters will go i nto depth on each tool. Step #1. Covert Model. Covert Hypnosis begins with conversation. Covert Hypnosis occurs within a conversation. This means that you will start your hypnotic procedure by striking up a normal (seemingly normal) discussion about anything. If the person whom you want to hypnotize is someone that you know well, and conversation comes easily and naturally, any topic you choose is fine. Any topic they choose will work as well, at least for beginning the conversation. If the person whom you wish to hypnotize is a complete stranger, such as someone you have just met, at a bus stop, at a seminar, a new employer (or prospective employer), someone you are interested in asking out on a date, etc., it is very useful to begin by offering a complement. Here’s an example: YOU: “That is an absolutely beautiful coat you’re wearing.” SUBJECT: “Thank you!” YOU: “Where did you get it?” SUBJECT: “Oh, I’m not really sure, it was a gift.” Now that a conversation has begun, you can start to ask t hem questions about themselves to get them talking. People love to talk about themselves. This is one of the great truths about interpersonal communications. It really has remained a great secret of interpersonal communication because so few people unde rstand or apply this simple truth. So remember this very powerful fact: “People love to talk about themselves” "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 28 Once you get the ball rolling, with a simple compliment, continue by asking them simple questions that require them to talk about what is most precious to them — their own life, their own interests, their hobbies, their dreams and aspirations, etc... A good way to bridge from an opener, such as, “That’s a beautiful coat you’re wearing...where did you get it?” is to pause — after they answer, and then m ake a light comment about something neutral, such as the weather. You can always comment about the weather. It’s got to be one of two subjects of conversation: The weather is either good, and something to be happy about, or the weather is bad, something to complain about. Regardless of which it is, you always have a neutral subject of conversation to use as a bridge after you compliment a person. The reason for the neutral bridge is that if you start off by asking too many personal questions, you might scare them. I once was in a mini mart buying a cup of coffee and I noticed, out of the corner of my eye, someone staring at me. I had that uncomfortable feeling that I was being watched. Out of the blue, a man walked up to me and said, “You look reall y familiar — do you work around here?” I answered, “No, I’m in this area on business.” He replied, “Oh, do you live around here?” I said, “No.” Then this stranger asked, “Where do you live?” Not wanting to give this complete stranger any personal inform ation, I made up a town and walked away. I could have said, “None of your business”, but I didn’t want to be rude or confrontational. I walked outside and this man followed me. I quickly walked to my car, avoiding any further eye contact with him, got into my car and locked the door. This man got into his car, then got out and walked over to my window, smiling. I rolled down my window just a little and said, “What?”. He handed me an envelope and began to tell me that he was self employed and was look ing for motivated people who want to earn extra money and build their own business. Immediately I recognized what he was doing — trying to recruit me for a multi - level marketing business. And then I understood why he had asked me those questions. Undoub tedly he has been to a recruitment training where they taught him how to “strike up a conversation” with total strangers by “getting them to talk about themselves”. Either he had been trained poorly or was improperly using a basically sound idea. This ma n was going around scaring people by acting like a weirdo. You can’t just walk up to people and start asking them highly personal questions — they’ll be spooked and think you’re a stalker or something. This is why I teach the gentle art of starting a conve rsation by complimenting, pausing, and then making a light, neutral comment about the weather. Then you can ask a safe personal question — something that is in an appropriate context for the situation. One example of such a question might be, if you are on a bus at 7:45 am, “On the way to work?” Chances are very good that they’ll say “Yes”. If they do, you can respond with a relatively safe follow - up question like, “What do you do?”"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 29 People love to talk about themselves — but only to people they like and t rust. Don’t scare people off by being too personal to quickly. In an upcoming chapter, I’ll teach you several excellent techniques for unconsciously establishing rapport with anyone you meet — in a matter of seconds. These rapid rapport - building methods, coupled with the questioning approach I just gave you, will allow you to build trust quickly, and start a conversation instantly, with virtually anyone you’ll ever meet. Step #2. Organized Multiple Stories. Covert hypnotists use stories with a hidden me aning. Organized stories means that you plan your stories in advance so that they are directed towards achieving a specific outcome. Multiple stories are, for the purpose of Covert Hypnosis, stories within stories. I prefer to use three levels or layers or stories. In other words, I begin to tell a story, then I very subtly I change to a second story. Then I begin a third story. Sound confusing? That’s exactly the point. The purpose of using stories is to deliver your persuasive message in a non - thr eatening, indirect manner. Stories have been used for that purpose for thousands of years. Multiple stories add power to the process by confusing the conscious mind. In Covert Hypnosis we want to communicate directly with the unconscious, or “other - than - conscious” mind. By telling long, winding, multi - layered stories, we distract and confuse the conscious mind and, using a variety of other techniques, send our message directly to the subconscious. Here’s an example of an Organized Multiple Story: The o ther day a friend of mine was telling me about a time when she went to Wisconsin. She really loved going there, and once went up with her husband to visit a friend’s farm. They had a really wonderful time, just enjoying the beautiful weather, country atm osphere, and nature. My friend loved to take long drives out in the Wisconsin countryside, looking at all of the beautiful sights, seeing the gorgeous trees, the bright flowing fields, and looking at the wondrous animals. “How fascinating it is”, she wou ld say, “to just gaze at the beautiful deer, with their brown coats and deep brown eyes. And how nice it is to look at the beautiful rabbits, with their white and grey coats, hopping through the fields. She would ride for hours in her car just really enj oying the moments, allowing herself to become absorbed in the present, not thinking of anything in particular, just really relaxing and living life to the fullest. On occasion, her husband’s long brown hair would blow in the wind and touch her face, insta ntly reminding her of the stories he would tell of his fishing trips, where slowly, peacefully, he would just drift out on the calm, peaceful lake, just listening, really listening to the sounds of nature surrounding him. The low murmur of the locust, the rustling of the trees in the night air, the occasional sound of water splashing as a fish would jump out of, and then fall back into the water. Really tuning in and just listening, closely and intensely, to the sounds all around him. How he loved to hea r those crystal clear sounds of nature. How it gave him such an inner sense of peace and tranquillity, allowing him to just tune out all other thoughts, and just really become"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 30 tuned in to the present moment. Giving him such a sense of inner calmness and comfort, very much like the feeling you get walking into a wonderfully warm, cozy log cabin, coming in from the bitter cold on a dark night in the deep of winter. All bundled up in a snow suit, wearing heavy gloves, snow boots, a wool hat and a scarf wrap ped around your face, your fingers and toes so cold that they’re numb. As you walk into the cabin, you feel a comforting rush of warm air all around you as you immediately see the intensely bright roaring fireplace glowing with an incredible heat. As you come closer to the fireplace you feel the intense heat on your face, and the warmth soothes and comforts your skin. You remove your scarf and hat and the comforting heat now flows around you ice cold ears, quickly warming them. As you remove your gloves and place your hands out in front of you, the delightful heat surrounds your fingers slowly thawing them and bringing about comfort and warmth. You remove your coat and boots and now begin to feel the heat all over your entire body. Starting from the to p of your head, the warmth feels so wonderful! So soothing, giving you such an incredible sense of comfort. Your face and neck are beginning to feel the warmth and a profound sense of relaxation begins to swell up inside you. Your shoulders and arms are now beginning to feel the warm soothing comfort as well, and now your fingers, too. The cold is just flowing out of your body, drifting away as the kind and gentle warmth pervades through you. Now you can feel the comforting heat and deep relaxation a ll the way down both legs and into your toes...so soothing, so relaxing, so comforting, and you can just let those incredibly comforting feelings continue to become stronger and bigger, making you feel so good inside. Now, that was a triple Organized Multi ple Story. I began telling a story, and then switched to another story, and then switched again to a third story. The transition from one story to the next was so smooth and seamless that the listener gets lost in the details. And this is precisely what you want them to do. You want to distract, or confuse, their conscious mind so that you can direct secret instructions to their unconscious mind. There were a number of other techniques included in the above stories, and you will learn about them lat er in this chapter. Combined, several of these techniques become incredibly powerful and highly persuasive. We will refer back to Organized Stories later in the book, but for now, just think of them as a story within a story that is designed to distract the conscious mind so that secret instructions can be directed to the subconscious. Bill O’Connell’s Truth #1 About Covert Hypnosis: “If you try to get a person to buy into your idea they will often resist.” Instead, tell that person a long, wanderin g story and indirectly suggest your"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 31 idea and they will likely think of that idea as their own at some point in the future. In a nut shell: “If it’s your idea, they resist. If it’s their idea, they support it.” Step #3. Verbal - Breathing Synchronizati on. This technique alone can work magic for you. It is amazingly potent and is my single favorite method for developing deep rapport with total strangers, literally in seconds. While the basic technique deals with breathing, we are going to take it seve ral steps further and expand on a number of highly effective ways to make people like and trust you rapidly. And if people like and trust you, your efforts to influence them will be very well received. Here’s the basic technique: Pace your verbalizati ons to match when your subject either inhales or exhales. In other words, talk only when they inhale or only when they exhale. The best way to determine when they are inhaling or exhaling is to watch their chest and/or stomach. When their chest rises, t hey are inhaling; when their chest lowers, they are exhaling. Watching the stomach works the same way; it’s just that different people breathe differently. Some people breathe in a way that raises their chest, resulting in a more noticeable movement in t he chest area; others breathe in a way that raises their chest, resulting in a more noticeable movement in the chest area; others breathe in a way that causes more motion in their stomach area. As you begin studying the way people breathe, and really begi n noticing slight movements, you will begin to develop an appreciation for subtle chest and stomach movements. It does not matter whether you choose to speak when your subject inhales or exhales. What matters is that you only speak when they inhale or e xhale. Stay consistent. This single technique is so amazingly powerful, as you will see for yourself once you begin using it. Verbal - breathing synchronization induces a deep, albeit temporary, rapport between you and your subject. Why does it work? I’ m not entirely sure, but I do believe that when you speak only when a person inhales or exhales, you become in tune with their natural and unconscious rhythm. In other words, you become like them because you are matching a part of their physiological cade nce. This brings us to: Bill O’Connell’s Truth #2 About Covert Hypnosis: “People like people who are like them. By subtly matching key aspects of their body language, you can become more like the person you wish to influence.” Verbal - breathing sync hronization works outside the consciousness of your subject’s mind. In other words, they are not aware that you are doing it — consciously. The unconscious, which controls breathing (and heart rate, and perspiration, and eye blinking, etc.), is very much a ware that you are in “synch” with it."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 32 The second step in developing unconscious rapport is to subtly mirror the way your subject moves their body. In other words, if they hold their head at a slight angle, you do the same. If they smile a certain way, y ou do the same. If they gesture repeatedly in a specific manner, you do the same. The same principle holds true with this mirroring technique: people like people who are like them. And by developing the same body posture, gestures, and movements as yo ur subject, you are saying to them, subconsciously, “I am like you!” Now, please read this next sentence carefully: When mirroring another person it is critical that you do not “mimic” them or make your movements in such and exaggerated manner as to be o bvious about what you are doing! Subtlety is the operative word here. Don’t do everything that they do; only some things that they do. In other words, pick out one or two major things that they do and key in on those. For example, if your subject sits back in their chair and crosses their left leg over their right leg, then you could sit like them — same posture, same leg crossing. And if they gesture a certain way when they get excited about something, you can gesture similarly when trying to get them excited about an idea. But don’t do everything they do. Don’t be a mimic. Just get in synch by being like them with a couple major aspects of their non - verbal language. The technique you just learned is my favorite way to induce deep rapport quickly. Years ago, when I was dating, I mirrored the body language of my dates at dinner. The rapport that ensued from using just this one technique was so profound that it became common for me to hear the comment, “I feel like I’ve known you my entire life!” I strongly urge you to try this single method in your dealings with others. The results you get will absolutely astound you. The third technique for developing deep rapport rapidly is to adjust your voice qualities to become similar to those of your subj ect. This technique continues along the lines of verbal - breathing synchronization, and mirroring body language, but takes it a step further. If your subject speaks softly, begin to adjust your voice to become soft like theirs. If your subject speaks slo wly, slow down your speech to a rate similar to theirs. If your subject speaks in monotone, you do the same. Volume, tone and speed are three excellent voice qualities to begin tuning into. Begin to pay attention to your own voice qualities. Play with them. Develop flexibility by impersonating the voices (in private!) of famous people as well as those around you. Try lowering your voice. Try raising your voice. Try speaking very quickly. Then speaking very slowly. Record your voice on tape, with a ll kinds of different variations in volume, tone and speed. Then play it back and listen to how you sound. It might surprise you to learn that you really do sound like the voice on the tape! The reason you don’t think that that’s how you really sound is because when you speak, you hear your voice filtered through your skull. You hear your voice through your ears, from sound waves coming in from out of your head as well sound wave penetrating internally through your head. "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 33 The greater flexibility you d evelop in your speaking ability, the better able you will be to adjust your voice qualities to match those around you, including those whom you want to influence. Step #4. Encrypted Instructions. As I stated earlier, if you tell someone to do somethin g, there is a high probability that they will resist. Bosses and parents often like to “tell” their employees and children what to do. And often employees and children feel they have to listen and obey. But of course, in the long run, they don’t have to listen and obey. Not forever. And if you “order” your employees or children to do things, I can guarantee you one thing will happen: they will resent you. Let me repeat that: They will resent you. And the reality is that you can only “boss around” you r employees or children for so long. Because if you make them resent you, they will leave you. They may not be able to do it right away. It may take some time. But rest assured, they will leave you if they resent you. I do not believe in ordering peop le around, especially if those people are children. It’s bad enough being an adult and having some control over your own life, and being able to make choices. Even with the freedom that comes with being an adult, it still sucks to be ordered around. But kids? What control do they have over the big decisions in their lives? If they have controlling parents, very little. It’s always the control freaks that want their kids to “behave” and then never give them the freedom (and positive encouragement) to d evelop responsible self - behavior. Anyway, my point is this: Nobody likes to be told what to do! You don’t. I don’t. Nobody likes to be bossed around, ordered around, or told that they have to do something. Encrypted Instructions let you direct the be havior of others without doing any of that. In its most basic form, an encrypted instruction is a statement to do something “hidden” inside of a question. Here’s an example: If I say to you, “Close the window!” I am telling you what to do. If, on the o ther hand, I say to you, “Can you please close the window?” I am ostensibly asking you to do something. But if I mark out the instruction portion of the sentence (through some verbal or non - verbal method), I can turn that question into an encrypted instru ction! Thus: “Can you please close the window ?” Notice in the above sentence that some of the words are italicized. It is the italicized words that I either say differently, e.g. use a different tone of voice, or I mark out through a unique hand gest ure. It is those words in Italics that are now the encrypted instruction. "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 34 The conscious mind hears a polite question. The unconscious mind hears a direct instruction! (And in hypnosis, it’s the unconscious mind that we want to influence — it’s the only o ne that listens!) To really develop an appreciation for the subtle ways you can embed an instruction within a question, I highly recommend that you get a set of my Covert Hypnosis Home Study Course audio tapes. On these tapes you will hear the voice infl ection and intonation that I use when encrypting instructions. The course can be ordered by contacting my office. I devote an entire chapter to Encrypted Instructions later in this book. In that chapter I will teach you several clever ways of creating E ncrypted Instructions. Once you learn the structure of each pattern, you will be able to spontaneously create “custom” Encrypted Instructions for each unique situation you are in, anytime during your life. Encrypted Instructions are a lot of fun becaus e you fool the conscious mind with a distracting question or other form of mental subterfuge, and, simultaneously, you tell the subconscious exactly what it is that you want it to do. It really is multi - level communication. You are carrying on two separa te and distinct conversations — one with your subject’s conscious mind, the other with their unconscious. We will delve much deeper into the design and use of Encrypted Instructions shortly. For now, I’m wondering if you can stop for a moment and just re ad this section on Encrypted Instructions again so that you find yourself becoming intrigued and fascinated with this very clever tool. Step #5. Repackaging Sensory Input. This requires some explanation. We all have senses with which we experience the world. Most of us have the ability to see, hear, touch, taste and smell. Those of us that have all of our senses are incredibly blessed and extremely fortunate. It is far too easy to take for granted the ability, for example, to see. Can you even imagi ne NOT being able to see? Not being able to look in the eyes of those you love? Not being able to enjoy a beautiful sunset? Not being able to enjoy the gorgeous colors on a late fall day? If you have your sight in good working order, you are blessed wi th an incredible gift from God. I feel so incredibly grateful that I can see! Many people are not so lucky. Think for a moment about how precious the ability to see really is. Now think about the ability to see both outside of your body as well as insi de your mind. What do I mean by that? Hold your hand up in front of you and look at it. Study it for 30 seconds. Look at the various shades of skin tone. Look at the outline of your fingers and thumb. Look at the lines and wrinkles. Your ability to see your own hand is a function of external visual sensory input. In other words, the ability to see outwardly. Now, after you read this paragraph, close your eyes and see a picture of your own hand that you just studied. See it in your mind’s eye. Can you see your own hand using just your imagination when your eyes are closed? Most of you can. Some people, though, do not have a well - developed conscious awareness of their ability to visualize. If you have trouble visualizing"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 35 (seeing pictures in your mind’s eye when your eyes are closed) simply stare at your hand again, with your eyes open. Then close your eyes and use your imagination and see a picture of your hand. Keep doing this, alternating between looking at your hand with your eyes open, and v isualizing an image of your hand with your eyes closed, until you can see your hand in your mind’s eye. The ability to visualize is something we all possess, although visualization is different for those people who have been blind since birth. They can’t remember what they have never seen, but they can see images that come to them in the form of dreams. Visualization is one of the main ways that people process information. Pictures are on of the primary ways that people remember the past and think about the future. You can tell when a person is thinking in pictures by carefully listening to the words they are using. A person making pictures inside their head will say things like, “Yes, I can see what you are saying.” They are seeing , that is making a picture in their mind’s eye , of what you are talking about. A person using visualization will also say things like, “That’s clear to me.” or, “That looks good.” See , clear , and look are all examples of visual thought processing. Now all people use al l of their available senses to create their own internal reality. But most of us have a favorite sense that we use more often that the others. Most people in the USA are more inclined to make pictures inside their heads when thinking. We in the US live in a highly visual culture. But not all people are predominantly visual. Some people create their internal reality primarily through sounds . These people still make pictures inside their head, and they still use their other sense as well, it’s just that they prefer using words and sounds over any other sense, at least most of the time. People who process their thoughts mainly through the auditory channel will use words such as, “listen”, “sounds” and “hear”. They will say things like, “I hope you are l istening carefully because this is very important, and “Yes, that truly sounds good to me”, as well as, “I hear what you are saying.” They hear what you are saying because they have a highly developed internal auditory sensory system. That is, they proce ss their own thoughts, and thus create their own reality, primarily through sounds and voices. Other people process information mainly through feelings. They aren’t consciously aware of pictures when they remember the past or think about the future. The y also often won’t admit to “talking to themselves” because they are so feeling - oriented. Yes, they do in fact say things to themselves and they do in fact make pictures inside their head, but consciously they are unaware that this is going on! It’s peop le who are very feeling - oriented that often claim they cannot visualize. They can, they just have to become conscious of their own ability. Now it is extremely important to point out that ALL PEOPLE use ALL of their senses. No one is a “visual”. Nobody uses sounds exclusively. And no one processes his or her internal reality through feelings alone. WE ALL USE ALL OF OUR AVAILABLE SENSORY"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 36 CHANNELS, EXTERNALLY (gathering sensory stimuli from outside ourselves) AS WELL AS INTERNALLY (processing thoughts inside our heads). We all use ALL of the senses we are blessed with. But we do tend to favor one sensory system over the others. And if we each have a “favorite” way of creating processing our own thoughts, that sensory channel will be the one we use mo st often, and thus will seem “normal” to us. For example, if you process your thoughts primarily through pictures, or if you are consciously aware of pictures more so than sounds and feelings, “seeing” things in your mind’s eye for you is quite natural an d easy to do. If I were to describe something to you using primarily sounds (auditory sensory channel) this would be — for you — out of the ordinary. (Out of your ordinary). And this is the basis for the process of repackaging sensory input. You repackage information (the words you speak) to “speak to” a sensory channel that is different from the one your subject favors. This serves to achieve your desired outcome of inducing an “altered” state. Any state that is different from what your subject ordinaril y experiences is “altered” from their “normal” reality. If you doubt this is true, consider this test: Engage in an ordinary conversation with a friend. Talk about simple, common events such as the day’s weather, gossip about an acquaintance, etc. The n close your eyes and keep them closed for 10 minutes. While keeping your eyes closed, continue the conversation. You will soon notice how your internal experience has changed. Your conscious awareness will be different or altered from how it normally i s because you don’t normally have a conversation with a friend for ten minutes with your eyes closed (this is true for most of you reading this. For some of you, such an experience will NOT be unusual, and you will need to alter your experience in some ot her manner — easy to do if you think about the numerous ways to accomplish this). The same “altered” state experience occurs when you repackage sensory input. You purposely make your subject experience their reality differently, and, in essence, knock them off their conscious balance. This serves to create for you a pathway into their unconscious mind. Here is an outline for using the Repackaging Sensory Input approach for inducing an altered state of consciousness in others: A. Determine what your subject’ s dominant sensory channel is. Do this by listening to the words they use to describe their own experience. B. While in conversation with your subject, begin speaking to them using their favored sensory channel. C. Switch to speaking in a different sensory chan nel in the middle of the conversation. Maintain use of this sensory channel for several minutes. Step # 6. Triggering Post - Hypnotic Instructions. Post - hypnotic instructions (or suggestions) are amongst the most fascinating and useful of all hypnotic t echniques. Post -"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 37 Hypnotic Instructions (PHIs) are essentially stimulus response or classical conditioning activities. You associate a pre - determined stimulus with a desired response. For example, while hypnotized you tell your subject that whenever the y hear the word “green”, they will have an intense desire to remove their watch. I set up this exact trigger on a subject. Once I brought the subject out of trance, I casually used the word green on several occasions. After the third repetition, my subj ect removed his watch and placed it on the couch next to him. When I asked him why he removed his watch, his first response was to say that he had not removed it. Upon pointing out his watch resting on the couch, my subject was amazed and in a state of d isbelief! Not only did he obey the PHI, he had total amnesia for it. You can covertly set up and then trigger PHIs through the use of Encrypted Instructions and Organized Multiple Stories. Such techniques will be explained in chapter 13. Chapter Seven Exercise for Mastery: Memorize the acronym C.O.V.E.R.T. and the meaning of each key element, e.g., Organized Multiple Stories — know what they are and be able to explain the general concept.

Your efforts are covert by design. That really is the primary dif ference between indirect hypnosis , developed by Milton Erickson in the 1940s, and Covert Hypnosis. People knew Erickson was a hypnotist and many of his subjects went to him seeking hypnosis. But Erickson was also a bit of a scoundrel, and liked to play t ricks on people. I strongly suspect that on more than one occasion he hypnotized a subject without telling them that he was doing so. And as you’ll learn in this chapter, as well as the next, Erickson hypnotized during seemingly innocent conversation and through telling stories about other people. One of Erickson’s favorite approaches in utilizing indirect hypnosis was to tell a story about another patient. After gathering information about his clients, such as what they hoped to achieve through his a ssistance as well as what they perceived the major roadblocks to be, Erickson would frequently say something to the affect of, “I had a client one time who...” and begin telling a complex tale that would delight, intrigue and ultimately entrance his subject. More on these entrancing stories later. For now, let us concentrate on the initiation of a conversation, and how this sets the stage for our covert efforts. Here is a simple, three - step model for developing conversations with anyone — people you know w ell to complete strangers. How to Start a Conversation: Step One: Prepare yourself . Attitude, memorized statements and questions. Step Two: Initiate a Conversation using sincere compliments, chitchat and questions about them. Step Three: Remember the Key to Successful Conversations: Keep your subject talking about themselves through questions, smiling, and attending skills. The more they talk about themselves, the more “interesting” they will think you are! The three simple steps listed above w ill work wonders for you with the vast majority of people that you wish to converse with. Let’s review each step carefully: "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 40 Step #1: Prepare yourself. Attitude, memorized questions and statements. Preparation is the critical key. If you know exactly w hat you are going to do, say and ask, and have rehearsed adequately, you are going to have a strong amount of confidence about what you’re doing. Remember — competence is the foundation that confidence rests upon. You cannot expect to be confident if you d o not prepare thoroughly. The best way to prepare is to begin with a script. Prepared opening questions and statements may seem “canned” to you, and yet they are necessary until you have become so adept at initiating and maintaining conversation that su ch “lines” become automatic or intuitive. Here are three excellent opening statements and questions that you can memorize, rehearse and become very skilled at using when striking up a conversation with anyone: “That coat (or other item they have in thei r possession) is very interesting, may I ask where you got it?” 1. “Can you believe this weather we’re having?” (Regardless of the weather, good or bad, this line works as an icebreaker). 2. “You look very familiar — where do I know you from?” This is a great l ead in to a series of questions such as, “Did you go to U of M?” (Or other geographically appropriate school), or, did you used to live in ________?” (Any nearby city), or “Do you work for ________?” (Name a large, local organization, corporation, agency, etc. It doesn’t matter if they say yes or no — that’s not the point. You simply want to initiate dialogue. As you practice and experiment, you will learn to comment or ask questions on/about the smallest pieces of information, which will serve to stimulat e a real conversation. Practice these opening questions on either an imaginary stranger or with a friend whom you trust and feel comfortable developing your skills with. Nothing works like the real world, so after several days of study and practice, get out there and start striking up conversations with total strangers. If you are naturally outgoing, this will be exceptionally easy for you and may seem unnecessary. If you are shy or introverted, this exercise may be excruciating. The only way to overco me this pain of talking with other people — especially strangers — is to get out there and do it, and keep at it. The more times you strike up a conversation with someone you do not know at all, the better you will get at it, and the easier it will get. Afte r 100 times, I guarantee you’ll be a pro. KEEP AT IT. Step #2: Initiate a conversation using sincere compliments, chitchat and questions about them. We already discussed beginning the conversation, but what if they don’t respond favorably, at least a t the start? You may choose to back of asking questions if they seem hesitant to answer. Transition into “self disclosure” and mention a few things about yourself, such as: “Boy, am I glad this week is almost over — I have had one tough week.” And then t ell them a thing or two about why your week has been difficult. As they say, misery loves company, and people love to bitch (including me). Once you start sharing some of your mild problems, they may be inclined to either share some of theirs, or possibl y begin advising you (people also love to give advice — especially when its unsolicited). "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 41 Another good self - disclosure approach is: “I can’t believe how fast time flies. It seems like just yesterday the year was just beginning”. (Obviously, you wouldn’t want to use this particular approach during January or February.) Probably the best approach is to just let out whatever is on your mind. Be honest. Talk about what you are thinking about. Talk about what you are concerned with, or looking forw ard to, or interested in. If you share information about yourself, most people will respond favorably and either comment on what you said, or ask you a question or two. The key to remember is that by talking about yourself you are looking to initiate a c onversation. You do not want the conversation to continue focusing on you. The focus should be on them. Which brings us to: Step #3: Remember the key to successful conversations — keep your subject talking about themselves through questions, smiling, an d good attending skills. The more they talk about themselves, the more interesting they will think you are! Dale Carnegie said, many years ago, “You can make more friends in two weeks by become interested in other people than you can in two years by try ing to get them interested in you”. I have found this statement to be absolutely accurate, and refer to it as “Carnegie’s Rule”. And you want to show your subject that you are interested in them through smiling and good attending skills. What are attend ing skills, you ask? They are simple and small (but very meaningful) ways to communicate that you are following what they are saying, and that you are interested in them continuing. A lack of good attending skills is a major reason that many people are lousy conversationalists. Far too many people are only interested in what they are going to say next, and it shows. They shake their head up and down while you are talking, as if to say, “Yea, yea, yea, -- hurry up and finish”. Or they may look away wit h a blank stare. Or they may interrupt you and cut you off mid sentence. These are classic examples of poor attending skills. Avoid them at all costs. Here are several examples of excellent attending skills that, with practice and use, will dramaticall y increase the success and positive impact you have as a Conversationalists: 1. Smile! Frequently. It takes practice, but a big, genuine smile is heart warming to most people and serves to instantly induce positive feelings in most people. 2. Maintain eye con tact. 3. S - L - O - W - L - Y nod your head up and down every 15 - 20 seconds to non - verbally convey that you are tracking what they are saying. 4. Use words/phrases such as, “Oh, that’s interesting”, and, “I see”, and, “Really? Tell me more about that”. To show your int erest and ask them to expand on what they are talking about. 5. Raise your eyebrows when they say something interesting. Again, this shows them that you are tracking. "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 42 These skills, along with the rapport - building tools you’ll learn about in the chapter on V erbal - Breathing Synchronization, will work wonders for you in developing strong bonds with people, very quickly. Chapter Eight Exercises for Mastery: 1. Commit to memory three different conversation - initiating questions. Memorize the five key attending skills. 2. Practice one different attending skill at least 15 times per day during the next week. 3. The next ten times you are in an elevator, strike up a brief conversation with someone on the elevator.  "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 43 CHAPTER NINE Organized Multiple St ories Covert Hypnosis really is story telling hypnosis. Stories are absolutely wonderful tools for persuading. They capture the imagination, they absorb listeners, and they set the stage for powerful emotional influence. The predominate reason that s tories are so effective in persuasion is that the listener does not consciously have to identify with any of the characters, themes, morals or outcomes of the story. But unconsciously it is very easy for them to identify with the intended message. And th at really is the main goal of using Covert Hypnosis — to get your subject to unconsciously connect with your intended message. In Covert Hypnosis we use Multiple Organized Stories designed to do two things: 1. Distract and confuse the conscious mind 2. Surreptit iously plant suggestions We already discusses the basic framework of Organized Multiple Stories (OMSs), so let’s continue by defining an easily learned, step - by - step formula for using them. The best way, in my opinion, to utilize OMSs is to have a stan dard set of three stories that you have memorized and can rely on at the spur of the moment. Take any three of your favorite stories either from your own personal experience, the experience of a friend, or fictitious stories that you are fond of. Then ch oose one key word that will remind you of each story. For example, if I were to choose a story about my most recent trip to the Wisconsin Dells, and then a story about my first year at college, and then another story about an old car that I once owned, my three key words could be: 1. Dells 2. College 3. Car I would then write the words down and, at first, write out specific highlights of each story next to each key word. I would keep a little piece of paper with the key words and highlights in my wallet (or pur se or pocket) for practice, and to spark my memory as needed. Once you have selected your three stories, next you need to select a series of transition phrases that let you easily and seamlessly segue from one story to the next. Here are a few excellent examples of transition phrases: 1. “Which reminds me of a time when...” 2. “And I had a friend once who...” 3. “Without paying attention too closely, suddenly I realized that...”"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 44 I particularly like number three, as it contains an encrypted instruction — “without paying attention too closely” can be subtly emphasized to instruct the subconscious mind to pay attention while telling the conscious mind not to. A fourth way to transition from one story to the next it to just do it, without any reason or explanation. I f your subject is already entranced by your story, you can very often just stop talking about one thing and start talking about something else. You’d be surprised at how easy this really is. This reminds me of a fascinating story I once heard about Abrah am Lincoln. It is said that Lincoln, being a practical joker, used to see how far he could go with fooling people. Here’s what he did: When guests would walk in to the ballroom of a formal dinner at the White House, the president would stand at the doo r, along with the First Lady and other dignitaries. As is tradition, while the guests would walk in, they would shake hands and offer salutations to each person in the line. While guests would stream in, Lincoln would smile, nod his head slightly, and shake each guests hand, and he would say common niceties such as, * “Welcome, glad to see you, good evening, etc.” Every third or fourth person, however, Lincoln is reputed to have said, “Your Mother’s a whore”. He did this of course without changing his voice tone or facial expression or posture one bit. He remained totally congruent — gently nodding his head, smiling etc. Most people did not even detect what Lincoln did. Those that thought they heard him say, “Your Mother’s a whore”, second - guessed th emselves, thinking, “did he just say what I think he said??? Of course not, he’s the President of the United States!!” Of course, the excitement of the evening, music playing in the background, and the noise of the crowd also very likely played a rol e in helping to distract the guests and make them wonder if they really heard what they thought they heard. But such distractions are common in life today. Use them to your advantage. (*I do not know exactly what phrases Lincoln used.) You will be amaz ed what you can get away with if you remain congruent and just keep talking! Your tone of voice and the pace at which you speak are both critically important. You want to speak in a soft and soothing manner, and, as you will learn all about in the next chapter, you want to synchronize your speech with the breathing rate of your subject. This is an incredibly powerful sub - conscious bonding tool. As far as the tone of voice is concerned, this brings us to: Bill O’Connell’s Truth #3 About Covert Hypnosi s: “When using Covert Hypnosis, speak as if you were trying to put a baby to sleep. Speak in a soft, gentle, soothing"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 45 tone of voice.” Now that we have discussed the basic structure of OMSs, let’s talk about how you put them to use. You don’t want to s imply tell a series of long, rambling stories for no specific purpose — you want to have a very specific outcome in mind. For simplicity sake, let’s call the purpose of your stories The Outcome. The Outcome is the point you want to drive home with your sub ject, but in such away that the conscious mind does not catch on. Before we go any further, take a moment to think of one specific thing that you want another person to do. This will be The Outcome that you want to include in your OMS. State your desire d outcome in positive terms, not negative terms. For example, don’t say, “I don’t want Sally to yell at me anymore”, instead state the outcome positively, “Sally speaks calmly and politely to me”. Another example would be, “Mike willingly does his homewo rk the hour before dinner” instead of, “Mike stops arguing with me about doing his homework”. Always state your outcome in the most positive terms possible. Talk about what you want, not about what you don’t want. Go ahead and write down one example so that you will remember it: The Outcome: ___________________________________________. What you want to do is disguise the message you are sending. There are three levels of disguise that we use in Covert Hypnosis: 1. Example 2. Inanimate Object 3. Removed Pro cess The Example technique involves describing what it is you want the subject to do in terms of another person. You are not talking about your subject, but another human being. Once use of this technique might be this: you want to persuade your wif e to purchase a remote - starting device for one of the family vehicles. You don’t want to bring up the idea directly because you strongly suspect that she will shoot it down. So instead, you decide to use Covert Hypnosis, specifically, Organized Multipl e Stories. You begin by determining the action that you want your wife to take (the Outcome), and then quickly construct a series of three stories that you can weave together. In one of the stories you decide to use the example technique: “Yesterday ther e was an article in the Tribune about a woman who had problems with her car starting on cold winter days. She bought this really helpful device that let’s her start the car from inside her house using a remote control.” Your are beginning to “drop a hin t”, to subtly suggest your idea. You are not telling your wife that you want to buy this new toy. You are not telling your wife that she should buy you"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 46 this new toy. And you are not trying to convince her of anything. You are simply telling her a story . Using the Example technique, you do not talk to your subjects directly about what you want them to do. You give examples of the idea that you want them to act on in use. Later, you will learn how to build emotional desire in your subjects using Encry pted Instructions and Triggering Post - Hypnotic Suggestions. Obviously, one does not have to be terribly astute to “pick up” on the use of the example technique. This is why you want to be very subtle when using it. Otherwise your subject will catch o n quickly. Just be low key and use the triple Organized Multiple Story approach when applying the example technique. Deliver your suggestions gently and indirectly. They will register subconsciously. The Inanimate Object technique involves using metap hor to describe what it is that you want your subject to do. Using this technique, you aren’t talking about them or another person — you are talking about a “thing”. Most people won’t consciously connect with a story about a “thing”. Here’s an example: “ Cars do not like this cold weather. Their oil gets thick as molasses, their valves stick, and their batteries drain, giving them very little power to crank the engine over with. One car wanted so bad to go inside where it was warm. He asked his owner if he could come in, but the owner had no garage. One day the car heard about an accessory that the owner could keep inside the warm house — a device that would allow the car to be started at the touch of a button, while the owner stayed inside. This wonderf ul invention let the owner warm the car up several times during the evening — and again first thing in the morning. This way the car’s battery stayed charged, the oil kept flowing easily, and the car started right up for the owner — every time. And this made the car so much happier.” That story conveys the indirect message that owning a remote car starting device is beneficial, but it does so through the fantasy of a car being “real”; having feelings, being able to think, etc. This use of the Inanimate Ob ject approach makes the story amusing, surreal, and emotional, while indirectly sending your message. Again, this technique would be used as one part of a three tier Organized Multiple Story, with Encrypted Instructions and Post - Hypnotic Instructions used to induce and build emotion. The Removed Process technique involves simply describing the motions one would have to go through to achieve the outcome you are going after. This approach specifically avoids using people or objects as examples and onl y describes processes, manners, and courses of action for doing a certain “thing” in a certain way. It’s nearly impossible to construct a story without referring to people, places or things (nouns), so you will have to include them in your Removed Process Stories, just don’t make them the focus of the story. Here’s an example: “...And sitting in the waiting room, awaiting the doctor’s call, there was this news report about this weather we’ve been having...so incredibly cold...and beginning right now to just fee l that piercing cold walking outside. Unable to open the car door because it froze...ears feeling like a"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 47 thousand sharp needles were sticking them...it hurts to breathe it is so bitter cold. Can you imagine how that pain feels? Wanting to avoid this terrib le bitter cold. Not wanting to feel this biting sub - zero chill. Just wanting to be warm now! So the report continues and talks about the ability to avoid the pain of the cold — at least some of the time — through a device that let’s you remotely start and warm up your car through a hand - held control. You don’t even have to go outside in that bitter cold until the car is warm! This is the kind of thing that you just want NOW. The show explained that many people are saying that you just have to have this n ow, feeling an uncontrollable urge to go buy this device today...” Reread the story above and try to locate the “Removed Process” suggestions included inside. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Now let’s read the story again with the covert processes underli ned: “...And sitting in the waiting room, awaiting the doctor’s call, there was this news report about this weather we’ve been having...so incredibly cold...and beginning right now to just feel that piercing cold walking outside. Unable to open the car door bec ause it froze... ears feeling like a thousand sharp needles were sticking them ...it hurts to breathe it is so bitter cold. Can you imagine how that pain feels? Wanting to avoid this terrible bitter cold. Not wanting to feel this biting sub - zero chill. Jus t wanting to be warm now! So the report continues and talks about the ability to avoid the pain of the cold — at least some of the time — through a device that let’s you remotely start and warm up your car through a hand - held control. You don’t even have to go outside in that bitter cold until the car is warm! This is the kind of thing that you just want NOW . The show explained that many people are saying that you just have to have this now , feeling an uncontrollable urge to go buy this device today ...” Rem oved Process Instructions are simply descriptions of how you want the subject to feel and actions you want them to take. They become more powerful when you combine them with Encrypted Instructions, which will be discussed at length in an upcoming chapter. Regardless of the type of techniques you decide to use when constructing your stories, you want to carefully select the words you use for maximum emotional impact. You do this to engage their imagination and build desire. SELL THEM THE BENEFITS USIN G EMOTIONALLY - LOADED SENSORY - BASED DESCRIPTIVE LANGUAGE You want to use your hypnotic languaging (all of the tools and techniques described in this book) to induce powerful emotions. You can do this by vividly describing how it is they will feel doing w hat it is you want them to do (irrespective of how disguised your message is). A very effective way to begin doing this now is to speak in “word pictures”. Word pictures are verbal descriptions of the details of pictures. Since most people process a large amount of their thoughts primarily through visualization, pictures are very useful in engaging the imagination and thought process of your"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 48 subjects. The more details you give, the “richer” or more vivid the experience will be for your subject. Fo r example, here are two descriptions of the “same” thing: 1. The calculator sat on her desk. 2. The calculator, with its off white plastic case, was lightly coated with dust. The number buttons were dark brown, while the function buttons (plus, minus, equals, e tc.) were a light brown, almost khaki. There were three blue memory buttons across the top and a bright red “clear all” button in the upper right hand corner. The small roll of white paper, on which the calculator could print, looked like it was about ha lf empty. The paper fed in from the top and up through a clear plastic guide with a serrated edge for easy tearing. Obviously you don’t need to go into that much detail about everything you speak about, but there will be times when you really want to m ake impact. The more details you provide, along with carefully chosen emotion words, the greater impact those words will have. This calculator example, while very descriptive with details is lacking emotion. You will want to add words describe emotiona l states (the states you want to induce) as appropriate. The more you know about your subject and their desires the better suited you will be for designing and inducing specific emotions. GUIDE THEIR THOUGHTS THROUGH LANGUAGE: You can very easily guid e the direction of your subject’s thoughts by simply interspersing such instructions in your speech, indirectly of course. Phrases such as: “letting your mind drift...NOW, and “just sitting there, with your eyes becoming more and more defocused...letting the sound of my voice slowly fade into the background as you begin to think about a specific time when...”, and “begin to make the experience real, right now...” can be included in all of your stories. They are presented not as directives aimed at your subject, b ut comments people have made, or comments you are making about a particular individual, thing, or event. If you want to induce, for example, a dreamy, trance - like state (you know, the kind of state you go into when you listen to a long, boring lecture, s peech or sermon) then make the experience real by re - creating a similar experience for them. Tell them a series of stories and then weave in a long, boring example. While you are doing this, describe how you want them to feel, e.g., “...and as he continued to work at this incredibly boring task, John began to grow weary, as if his mind kept saying over and over again, “you are getting so sleepy, so very sleepy . Your eyes are beginning to get heavier and heavier and it getting so hard to keep them up...they j ust want to c - l - o - s - e N - O - W...” Make the story real and vivid by describing how it is that you want them to feel. Voice inflection has a lot of impact here. We’ll talk more about that in the next chapter.

This is commonly known as rapport. It is highly desirable to be in strong rapport with the people you wish to influence. Chapter seven outlined three key appro aches to subconsciously inducing rapport with anyone: 1. timing your rate of speech so that you only speak when the subject is inhaling or exhaling (pick one and stick with it) 2. adjusting your body posture, slowly and subtly, to match your subject’s 3. adjusting your voice tone and tempo to that of your subject Again I will tell you that if you do theses three things, you will be amazed at the remarks you hear from people you have just met. People will begin to say to you, “I feel like I’ve known you a long tim e!”, and “we really seem to hit it off”, or “You really remind me of a good friend I have.” I would tell you to trust me on this, but I’d much rather you go out and use these covert bonding techniques — they are incredible! “People like people that are lik e themselves.” “Birds of a feather flock together.” Trite sayings? No. Very profound truths. Keep in mind that you are not obligated to try and pretend you are someone whom you really aren’t. That’s not the purpose. You want to influence your subj ect, and inducing a deep bond, ephemeral as it may be, is expedient for our purpose. I will now share with you three more outstanding tools for you to use in covertly inducing deep rapport with others, from total strangers to your family (sometimes it be nefits us to actually get in synch with those we truly care about!) This set of techniques includes: key word replay, ideological matching, and the synopsis method. Key word replay requires you to pay attention to certain words and phrases that your su bject is fond of (as indicated by their frequent use). For example, I once worked for a woman"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 52 who quite often would say, “Historically we have always....” And then go on to explain what and why she had done. This woman simply likes that phrase; she used it all the time. And if SHE likes it, then she will like it when I use it. There’s very little likelihood that this woman would pick up on my deliberate use of her pet phrase. But by using it, her subconscious mind says, “hey, this guy is like me — he mus t be smart!” Pay attention to the pet words and phrases people use. Make a mental note of those that are used in a positive context as well as those used to express negativity. Sprinkle your hypnotic stories with your subject’s favored phrases and you will strengthen the bond you are creating with them. Ideological matching is a forceful bonding tool. Have you ever been told, “Whenever you are with clients, do not talk about politics or religion”? This is because both politics and religion are ver y sensitive subjects. Many people hold strong political and religious opinions. And if your views differ from theirs, an argument or heated debate might ensue. At the very least, unspoken (or unconscious) resentment might arise. Rapport inducing, this is not. However, there is a fantastic upside to the “politics and religion” issue: If you and your subject are in accord with your views, nothing induces a state of affinity like it. Imagine someone who actually agrees with your views!! Wouldn’t that be a delight — to run into some stranger, strike up a conversation with them and find out they think like you! Now I’m not implying that you become a chameleon and change your deepest values with every stranger you meet. What I am implying is that the less y ou disagree with others the more in synch you will be. Spoken or unspoken, fewer disagreements (no matter how minor) enhances rapport. And the inverse is true as well. The more agreements you have, the stronger the rapport. So how do you actually put t his idea of “ideological matching” to work? Simple. Get your subject talking about highly emotional issues — issues that the subject has a deep conviction about. How do you get them talking? By directly and specifically asking them about such issues duri ng the course of your conversation. While they are explaining their views and opinions, you subtly nod your head up and down as if to say, “Yes, I agree”. But in fact you do not have to agree with the content of what they are saying, just that they are e ntitled to express their opinion. I have done this for many years. While a person was adamantly expressing themselves, I would nod my head and say to myself, yes...yes...yes...you are entitled to think what you want! At times, I would use a clever technique I stumbled upon where I would verbalize half of a thought aloud, and say the other half to myself: “Yes, I completely agree (that you are entitled to that opinion)”. The parenthetical portion of that thought was kept to myself."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 53 Another way to engage id eological rapport is to find areas of agreement within disagreements, and focus on those parts of a debate where you have common ground. You will want to think along these lines, as inevitably, someone is going to stop expounding their beliefs and say, “W ell what do YOU think??” Be prepared by thinking about the things you like in their argument. For example, if you are a died - in - the - wool conservative, you probably don’t care much for Bill Clinton. And if you have initiated a conversation with an indivi dual who, it turns out, is a died - in - the - wool liberal, and you want to influence them, you are going to need to say some positive things about the democratic party (not necessarily Clinton, unless they specifically bring his name up). Can you think of two or three good things the democrats are doing, have done, are planning on doing? If you are a liberal, and are trying to induce rapport with a conservative, can you think of two or three positive things to say about the conservative movement? If not, o r if you don’t feel comfortable doing so, DO NOT plan on using this technique — it WILL backfire. You do run the risk of being disingenuous if you try to fake that you believe something which you truly do not. I do not advocate dishonesty. I do promot e, however, the use of increasing the appearance of ideological congruence when it is used to induce compatibility with the express purpose of persuading others ethically. In other words, if your motive is pure, ideological matching can be both useful a nd noble. Select another technique if you are unable to congruently apply ideological matching. The synopsis method has actually been around for decades. It’s best known as the foundation for “empathic listening”. In its simplest form, the synopsis met hod involves remembering the key points of a person’s speech to you and then feeding them back — being as exact as you can in using their own words. You will be amazed at how practical this simple technique is. When you feedback another persons words — just as they spoke them, people have a tendency to feel that you truly understand them. And this, of course, is deeply powerful. Often, by “parroting” what they said, people are apt to think that YOU THINK THE SAME WAY. In other words, simply by repeating th eir words, they think you are agreeing with them! Bill O’Connell’s Truth #4 About Covert Hypnosis: “Before attempting to influence your subject induce a powerful bond with them.” Use these powerful techniques for rapid bonding with others and you will find yourself suddenly surprised and delighted at the speed and ease in which you develop strong rapport with people of all walks...

Encrypted Questions 2. Substitution 3. Reversal Encrypted Questions are clever and powerful. The best way to understand what an Encrypted Question is: “Encrypted Questions are Instruc tions encased within a question.” You can take any instruction and turn it into an Encrypted Instruction by using Encrypting the instruction within a question. Here’s an example: Instruction: “Clean up your Room!” Such an instruction will likely be ob jected to. As we discussed earlier, nobody likes to be ordered around. Now, let’s convert this instruction into an Encrypted Instruction using the Encrypted Question model: Encrypted Question: “I’m wondering how quickly you can clean up your room?” In this example, the complete instruction is still there. It’s just encased within a question format that serves to do two things: Number one, it’s no longer an order. The conscious mind no longer has to defend against an order. And number two, you can subtly deliver the instruction to the subject’s subconscious mind — without the conscious mind being aware of it (the conscious mind is aware of and focuses on the question ). You can add to the effectiveness of the Encrypted Instructions by placing emphas is on the instruction portion of your question. For example, in the following sentence, imagine that the portion in italics is spoken with a slight emphasis: “I’m wondering how quickly you can clean up your room ?” In this example, the clean up your roo m instruction is separated from the rest of the sentence/question through a slight change in voice inflection. The change in inflection does have to be slight so as to be imperceptible to the conscious mind. This is really easy once you know how and hav e practiced it adequately. Perhaps you will invest in a set of my Covert Hypnosis"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 56 Home Study Tapes to hear how to vary your inflection subtly and deliver powerful Encrypted Instructions. It may be challenging to try and imagine how these instructions sho uld be delivered until you hear them delivered correctly. Yes, you can learn from reading this book alone, but believe me, hearing the techniques in action will help you learn Covert Hypnosis all the more quicker with even deeper understanding. Now don’ t order your own set too soon, won’t you? It’s kind of like reading a book versus seeing the movie. Many people prefer reading novels instead of seeing the same story in the theater. They like to leave the images up to their imagination. But some peopl e prefer to go to the movies, and see the story come to life, right before their very eyes — and they get the whole story in two hours! The second way to deliver Encrypted Instructions is through Substitution . This approach involves substituting someone e lse’s words for your own. In other words, it’s not you making a statement, it’s someone else, someone who either doesn’t have the emotional “baggage” that you may have with the subject, or who does have more clout, respect, or influence than you . Here’s an example: You want your co - worker to agree to participate in a seminar with you. Instead of making a direct statement to them, you can substitute* who the statement comes from. First we’ll see how a direct statement/question would look: “I’m g oing to a really good seminar next week on effective interpersonal skills. I was wondering if you would like to go with me?” Now, we’ll apply the technique of substitution to this question: “The president of our company highly recommended a seminar on e ffective interpersonal skills. The seminar is next week. Would you like to go with me?” (*It helps immensely to pick someone who your subject is likely to respect, or someone who has a predisposition for influence with the subject. You are not always going to know this information about the people you want to influence, however. You also want to make sure that when you use substitution you are truthful and accurate about the things you say about others.) Now in the first example, it was you who was saying the seminar is good and therefore valuable to attend. You may not be in a position of influence with your subject. In the second example, using substitution, the endorsement for the seminar comes from someone who has implicit influence with your s ubject. This technique of substitution may seem simple or obvious to you. If so, let me ask you this: Do you use it regularly? Do you consciously endeavor to employ substitution, in a well thought - out manner, when planning to influence another? My gue ss is that while you may be aware of the technique of substitution, you probably do not use it very much at all in every day life. And certainly not to the extent that you could be using it when you really stop and"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 57 think...just for a minute...about how much m ore influential you can become by really taking the time to plan substitutions in advance. What you’re really doing with the Substitution technique of Encrypted Instructions is taking the influence one person already has with another, and attaching that influence to your instruction! Now that can be extremely powerful. The third method of encrypting instructions is through Reversal. Reversal is reverse psychology. Combined with one or more of the other techniques you are learning about in this book, Reversal becomes covert hypnotic reverse psychology. Let me explain: If I tell you to do something, say, wash the car, that is a direct order. As we have discussed previously, there is a high probability that you will object to such an order. If, howe ver, I say to you, “ Do NOT wash the car”, the only way for you to object to my “command” is to wash the car. This is an example of plain old reverse psychology. Now in this book, we are not talking about plain old reverse psychology. We want to add a hy pnotic spin to our persuasive approach, and do it in a surreptitious manner. To do this we would encase the reversal within a story and attach a desirable outcome to the end of the story. Let’s use the car wash example again. In this example, you want to convince someone to wash the family car (I’ll leave the “who” up to you): “I have a friend who was telling me about how excited he was to get lots of things done last weekend. He was explaining how good you could feel really getting an incredible sens e of satisfaction from doing the things you know that need to be done. He was telling me how he washed his car and how beautiful and clean it was and what a great feeling of accomplishment he had when he finished. Now I certainly wouldn’t want you to thi nk about that, now , at least not too soon...” Then you change the subject and move on to other topics. You have subtly and covertly implanted your suggestion. You didn’t give an order. You didn’t give a directive. You didn’t even ask the person to do an ything...you just told a story and told them not to think about what you just said. It’s important to point out that Reversal, like all covert techniques, are designed to be used independent of direct, authoritarian approaches. In other words, you do not want to argue with some one, or try to persuade them to think, feel or act in a certain way using traditional approaches, and then switch to covert methods — that’s NOT the way to use these tools. Covert Hypnosis is designed to be a new way of persuading. And to be effective it is crucial that you don’t jump to Covert Techniques after your conscious, logical attempts have failed. Start with Covert Hypnosis. Use the techniques fully and completely. Give them time to work. Speaking of time, it will help you a lot if you develop enough patience to give Covert techniques time to work. They typically operate on delay. You will usually see the results of your Covert persuasion manifest anywhere from several minutes to several days after you have given the hypnotic suggestions. Remember that the suggestions you are planting are directed"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 58 towards the subject’s subconscious mind. Your goal is for the suggestions to “suddenly appear” in the subject’s conscious mind, AS IF THEY WERE THEIR OWN IDEA. Remember, if it’s your idea, they will resist. If it’s their idea, they will support it. Covert Hypnosis takes your ideas and makes the subject think they are his/her own ideas. Chapter Eleven Exercises for Mastery : 1. Think of an idea that you would like to persuade an acquaintance to accept, act on, buy into, etc. Using that one idea, create: a. an encrypted question b. an story employing the principle of substitution c. a reversal statement 2.

"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 59 CHAPTER TWELVE Repackaging Sensory Input In a previous chapter the idea was discussed that most people process their thoughts through those sensory channels that they have. Those of us blessed with the ability to see, hear, feel, smell and taste have the capability to take in information (stimulus) from each of those sensory channels. We make sense of that “input” in our minds through those same senses, but through our imagination. In other words, you can see a tree through your eyes (visual channel sensory input), and you can “see” a tree with your eyes closed, in your mind, by using your imagination. Most people have a favored sensory channel — a preferred sense for processing their t houghts. Again, let me say that all people use all senses available to them but do tend to have a dominant or favorite one. If a person’s favored sensory channel is the visual channel, then they rely on that channel to process the majority of their thou ghts. Seeing pictures in their head is how they “make sense” of their world. This is “normal” for them. This is natural for them. This is comfortable for them. If you talk using words that “speak to” the visual channel (see, look, picture, clear, brig ht, big, etc.) your subject will easily and readily process the information you are offering. You are “speaking their language”. You are talking in terms which they automatically understand. If, however, you speak using words that are auditory channel oriented, you will make your subject experience their internal reality differently. Using auditory words makes a visually - oriented person think differently — in a way they are not accustomed to. What this does is induce an instantaneous altered state. An y state that is common or ordinary is “normal” — such as when they process information “their way”. If you cause them to process information in a manner inconsistent with what is normal, for them, you cause them to enter an altered state. By definition, a n “altered state” is any state altered from their normal state of consciousness. By switching from one sensory channel to another, you cause your subject to go inside their mind and think in a way they are not accustomed to. By continuing to speak using a sensory channel your subject does not normally/regularly use, you are altering their internal experience. Very often this causes the subject to become internally focused and absorbed in your story. This state of internal focus and absorption is exact ly what you want to occur. If you use the repackaging sensory input technique while telling a long, meandering organized multiple story, very often you will see your subject’s eyes glaze over as they become absorbed in your tale. This glazed eye look is evidence of internal focus and absorption,"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 60 commonly known as daydreaming or being lost in one’s thoughts. Of course, you are directing that daydream and surreptitiously guiding their thoughts. Keep it simple... Begin with one sensory channel (the subject ’s preferred channel), then switch to a second channel, then finally to a third channel.

"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 63 CHAPTER THIRTEEN Triggering Post - Hypnotic Instructions Post - Hypnotic Instructions (PHIs) are one of the cleverest tools to have in your Covert arsenal. In their simplest form, PHIs are stimulus - response links. Pavlov called this “classical conditioning”. You link a stimulus to a response, or you take advantage of an existing stimulus - response sequence. While classical conditioning has been around for decades, and there is a large amount of evidence supportin g its validity, few people recognize three things about them: 1. stimulus response triggers occur all the time 2. stimulus response links can be set up, and then triggered, covertly 3. most stimulus response links occur outside of conscious awareness You may not r ealize it but you trigger responses in people around you all the time. Automatically. It may be a certain facial expression that you give. It may be a gesture you offer. It may be the tone of your voice. But, unbeknownst to you, you do indeed trigger responses in other people with regularity. Don’t believe me? Ponder this question: Do you know anyone that has the unique ability to put you in a good mood whenever you see them? Start to analyze why this is so. Maybe it’s their personality. Perhaps they always have a kind word or a joke to make you laugh. Maybe they are always supportive. Or maybe they represent the type of person you want to be more like, in some way. Every time you are around them, and feel strong positive emotions, you uncons ciously associate those feelings to that person’s face. Their face then serves as a trigger (stimulus) that activates good feelings in you (response). Not convinced? Try this example: Have you even known someone who you really grew to dislike? I mean this individual had the ability to conjure up really bad feelings inside you. Think about the people you went to school with in the past, or used to work with, or maybe worked for. Maybe someone you dated fell into this category. Got someone in mind? N ow think back to a specific time when that person simply walked into the room. They were able to instantaneously induce a strong negative response in you — without even saying a word! Their face, in a flash, triggered all kinds of nasty emotions inside of you. That is stimulus - response conditioning. And some people are great at it, aren’t they? "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 64 The good news is that stimulus - response conditioning can be purposefully, and positively, set up in the form of PHIs. A stimulus - response link set up covertly b ecomes a Post - Hypnotic Instruction. Bill O’Connell’s Truth #5 About Covert Hypnosis: “Post - Hypnotic Instructions allow you to set up a trigger that, when activated, will automatically induce an emotional or behavioral response in others.” Setting up and then triggering PHIs is exactly what advertisers do. While you are deeply absorbed in a TV commercial, they engage your emotions, inducing powerful states of desire, then linking those states of desire to their product. For example, a beer commercial may be very funny, eliciting a strong, positive emotional state in the viewer. As soon as the viewer has the emotional response (they know when through extensive market research and “motivational research”) BAM! The product is shown. This simple sequenc e of eliciting a strong, positive emotional state and then showing the product the advertiser is selling is repeated over and over. The two get linked inside the mind. The Post - Hypnotic Instruction has been “programmed”. Now it’s just waiting to be trigg ered. So what triggers it? The next time the viewer finds themselves in the grocery store, and sees a picture of that specific brand of beer, BAM!, the trigger is fired and the linked emotional state is elicited. Suddenly, automatically, and entirely ou tside of their consciousness, the subject finds themselves wanting that beer. Beer is just one example. The same stimulus - response pattern can be — and is — used in advertising of all kinds. The great thing is that now you can harness this power and use it to get what you want, instead of having it used on you by marketers. There are two basic ways of utilizing PHIs that we will discuss here. There are more than three approaches to using PHIs, but we are going to concentrate on two excellent methods. Th e first is to utilize existing stimulus - response patterns in your subjects. You do this by becoming extremely sensitive and “tuned in” to what sets them off, both positively and negatively. For example, if you want to influence your husband, start by bec oming acutely aware of what triggers good moods in him. On what occasions has his mood rapidly changed from mediocre to elated? What triggered that mood change? Was is some type of good news? Did it have to do with a hobby or special interest he has? When you determine what the cause was, you will have your trigger. It may be something you can replicate, and it may not. Seek out triggers that you can easily reproduce or re - activate. For example, if there is a certain restaurant that your wife loves, just talking about that place will elicit positive emotions. Taking her their will likely intensify those emotions. How can you use these ready - made triggers to your advantage? "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 65 Well, taking your wife to her favorite restaurant in order to attempt to pe rsuade her to do something you want is a blatant tactic. It’s obvious. That is NOT what I am suggesting. Here’s what I DO suggest: During a conversation, casually mention several places, events, or people that you know are strong emotional triggers. W eave them in to your Organized Multiple Stories. Pre - conditioned emotional patterns are triggers that you can subtly fire off Covertly. They serve to put your subject at ease and induce good moods — both assets in covert persuasion. Don’t be obvious. Be indirect and obscure. The second way to apply PHIs is to elicit a specific existing emotional state and link it to what it is that you want them to do. You start the elicitation of a specific emotional state by asking a question such as: “Can you think of a time when you felt ___________?” When they say “yes”, bring out the details by asking them more specifics of that time. The more they go inside and re - live that experience, the more emotional it will be for them. For example, if you want to persua de your boss to go along with your decision to purchase a new $10,000 training program, ask a question that brings them back to a time when they made a purchasing decision that turned out well. You want your boss to re - experience the feelings associated w ith that decision. Help your boss feel those good feelings again. Make it real — vividly real. You do this with questions and the tone of your voice. Here’s an example: YOU: “Has there ever been a time when you made a very big purchase that turned out to be a great decision?” BOSS: “Sure.” YOU: “Can you tell me about it? What made it such a good decision?” BOSS: “We really needed to overhaul our hiring process and a one consultant had a program that sounded good, but was very expensive. I was i ndecisive because of the size of the investment. Ultimately I made the decision to go ahead and spend the $100,000 this guy charged. It turned out to be an excellent move. Turnover went down dramatically, and productivity increase 37% in the first 9 mon ths. We saved well over $250,000 by spending $100,000.” YOU: “Wow. How did that make you feel?” BOSS: “I was a hero around here. That single success made me the most eligible candidate for the vice - presidency, which I got several months later.” YOU : “And how did you feel when you became the hero?” BOSS: “Awesome!”"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 66 Now that you have assisted your boss in re - living that highly emotional positive experience, you want to set up a trigger so that you can reactivate these emotions on queue. So how d o we set up a trigger? It’s easy. You trigger can be, as we discussed earlier, a certain look , or facial expression. It can be anything. It must be unique, however. I’ll make it easy for you by giving you one simple trigger that you can memorize and use whenever needed: Reach up and grab your right ear and hold it for five seconds. That’s it. Simple. Unique. Different enough to not be “mixed up” with all of the other triggers we are all setting up and activating with one another all day long. W hen your subject is deep in the recollection of the experience that you helped them relive, reach up and grab your right ear and hold it for five seconds. I know that this sounds kind of strange, but believe me , it works. Don’t worry if you think your subject will catch on to the trigger you are setting up. Don’t even worry if they will wonder what you’re doing, if they do notice. If they ask why you are holding your ear, look at them strangely as if something is wrong with them and say, “What?” If they press, saying, “Why are you holding your ear?” say, “I don’t know” and change the subject. It is highly unlikely that your subject will catch on or comment to your ear holding trigger. But be prepared in case they do. ACVTIVATING YOUR TRIGGER Wh en you are ready to invoke the stimulus response pattern that you have so deftly set up, you want to position your subject properly. This means that you want to get them thinking about the object, circumstance, or idea which you are desirous of persuading them to accept. Once you have them thinking about what it is that you want them to do, reach up and fire off your trigger...and... BAM! You will induce the same emotional state linked to the trigger. You may have to activate the trigger two or three times i n some cases. Just keep talking, asking them questions, and maintaining the conversation while you subtly reach up and squeeze your ear. You really cannot appreciate how powerful Post - Hypnotic Instructions are until you experience their effect first hand . I assure you, the first time you fire off a PHI which you have carefully set up, and your subject complies with your request, you will feel a surge of adrenaline and excitement!

Each specific too l is unique and requires both the understanding of the concept as well as the effort to master the tool’s application. I can assure you that a simple “once over” reading of this book will not be sufficient if you want to put Covert Hypnosis to work for yo u. Take the time to learn the pieces, practice according to the exercises, and stick with your application of the techniques until you have absorbed and synthesized the material. There is no substitute for doing. Get out there and put your learning to u se while you are mastering it. Don’t wait until you have every technique down pat until you start applying your skills. Start using Covert Hypnosis today. Begin perfecting your talent tomorrow. Effective real world use of Covert Hypnosis requires, in m y opinion, two primary understandings and behaviors: flexibility and persistence. Nothing works all of the time. Let me repeat that: Nothing works all of the time. There are not any persuasive tools that with a 100% success ratio. If there were, we’d a ll be in trouble. Even the best “scientifically documented” tools of influence fail to work far more often than they succeed. And that’s OK. You don’t need to have a 100% hit ratio to be super successful. What you do need to do is keep at it, hang in t here, and constantly strive to improve your level of skill. Always remember Babe Ruth. He had more home runs than any other baseball player of his time. And he also had more strike outs than any other baseball player of his time. He held both records! The more you use Covert Hypnosis, the more success you will have with it, and the better you will get at it. REPITITION, REPITITION, REPITITION! When I was a kid, I was told, “Practice makes perfect”. The idea was that if you kept at it, you’d get better at anything. I believe that this is true. I also believe that you can stack the odds in your favor by using the incredible power of your imagination and visualizing yourself as you want to be. I have heard the platitude “practice make perfect” m odified as “perfect practice makes perfect” (I’m not sure by whom). What does this mean? It means that you want to see yourself as you want to be.

Let me repeat that: Use your mind’s eye as your studio, stadium or playground to visualize yourself performing perfectly. "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 71 Engage in daily self - hypnosis and spend ten minutes rehearsing your perfect performance of Covert Hypnosis. See yourself in clear, ri ch, and vivid detail, masterfully applying the tools of Covert Hypnosis. Do this daily for 30 days. HOW WELL WILL COVERT HYPNOSIS WORK? The factors affecting the results you will get using CH are innumerable. Because of this it is only prudent to repe at what we have all seen and heard so many times in advertisements : “All experiences are unique.” “Results will vary.” “Past performance is not indicative of future results.” All experiences truly are unique. The experiences you have tomorrow will be different form those you have today. You will be different tomorrow than you are today. Life is not static. It is ever - changing. So are people. Thus, results will vary from person to person and from situation to situation. And because of this, pas t performance will never be indicative of future results. Not on Wall Street, not in any sports arena, and not in any profession. Today’s top performers almost always become tomorrow’s “has - beens”. Some, of course, bow out gracefully, leave a legacy and are forever remembered for their greatness. They, of course, are the exceptions. Every student of this secret art will approach his or her own learning with a different background, different beliefs about possibility, a different style of learning and a different commitment to truly mastering the tools. This is one variable. How the tools are applied are a second huge variable. Some students will focus on one or two techniques and stick with them and have enormous success. Their narrow focus will s erve them. Other students will try one or two techniques and fail to stick with them and will thus yield poor results. Their narrow focus and lack of tenacity will be the cause. Other students will painstakingly study and master all of the techniques of Covert Hypnosis. They will adroitly apply the tools with skill, persistence, and determination. They will render positive results, even after initial stumbling. Others will learn all of the techniques but will try them out only a handful of times an d quickly give up. For these folks, success will not come. How Covert Hypnosis is applied is another variable. The context in which these tools are used is a third major variable. Some students will experiment with Covert Hypnosis in a wide range of environments, from getting their spouse to agree to go to a particular restaurant to persuading their boss to give them a raise, to influencing an insurance salesman to quote them a vary fair and reasonable price without any hassles. Because they experime nt with numerous environments, they will have various levels of success. Some successes will be better than others. Some will be worse than others. The people in this group know that the variables in each situation are vast and unique and that every ap plication of Covert Hypnosis is in fact a new experiment."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 72 Other people, however, will try the tools of Covert once or twice, hoping to hit the jackpot. When they don’t get the results they had desired, they quickly discard the tools as “ineffective”, pr ecluding any future application in a different context. Because this group is so quick to judge, they do not, and will not, yield positive results. When you add them up, the variables that affect the results Covert Hypnosis can produce are colossal. So me are within your control, others are not. There is no way to control or account for the majority of the variables that lie outside of your sphere of control. So do not worry about them. Key in on those that you can control: your level of skill, your pe rsistence, your commitment to improvement, and your commitment to on - going experimentation.

VOCAL TRAINING The sound of your voice is so critical when using Covert Hy pnosis. The greater range you have — and the greater conscious control you have over that range, the more effective you will be at developing deep levels of rapport and delivering Encrypted Instructions. Our Hypnotic voice training cassette teaches you how to do just this, and gives you dozens of specific examples. HYPNOTIZING THROUGH WITTNESSES A powerful method for covertly hypnotizing another person is to have the person whom you want to actually hypnotize witness or observe another person being hypn otized. Although you appear to be hypnotizing one person, it’s the person watching that you are actually directing your efforts towards. HYPNOTIZING THROUGH VIDEO TAPE This approach lets you hypnotize others across the country or even across the world — w ithout even being there! One way to do this is to simply video tape yourself hypnotizing another person and give specific suggestions to the person watching the tape. You can do this indirectly using all of the techniques you’ve learned in this book. A nother way to hypnotize by video tape is to talk about Covert Hypnosis — give a mini lecture on the subject — and actually do what you are talking about. For example, while you talk about Organized Multiple Stories, launch into a series of such stories. Then segue into talking about Encrypted Instructions and deliver four or five as you explain what they are. Next, you might tell another story, about a friend, who loved to set up and set off Post - Hypnotic Instructions, and then do just that while you weave y our PHIs into your story. There are many, many ways to intertwine actual CH techniques into stories. Just use your imagination and think up new ways of using stories, examples and analogies as the basis for explaining hypnotic techniques while you use th em. HYPNOTIZING THROUGH RELAXATION AND MEDITATION You can help one person — or an entire group of people — relax, reduce stress and feel better through relaxation exercises and guided meditations, and at the same time, apply every single technique you have learned in this book without your subjects’ awareness of what you are doing! Many therapists do this in private practice. They help their patients relax and/or deal"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 75 with their troubles through what they call “guided visualizations” or “relaxation exercis es” and actually use hypnotic techniques during the process. Some therapists do this consciously, and others are completely unaware that they do this. Irrespective of the intent, relaxation and meditation exercises are ideal environments for using Cover t Hypnosis. TEACHING OTHERS TO HYPNOTIZE FOR YOU If for some reason you are unable to get into direct contact with the individual whom you wish to hypnotize, one alternative strategy id to find someone who does have contact with this individual and have them do the hypnosis for you. An accomplice, ally, confederate, or conspirator — call them what you like, can very often prove extremely useful in your covert operations. ELECTRONIC HYPNOSIS There is a device on the market called the Brain Wave Synchro nizer that electronically induces an altered state in others. This fascinating gadget has been used by professionals, from dentists and clinicians to stage practitioners, and is reportedly highly effective in reducing the amount of time needed to induce a n altered state using traditional approaches. This device could also be used by the Covert practitioner under a variety of guises. I have personally experienced rapid altered states of consciousness by simply staring into a flashing strobe light. I sus pect that others too experience a shift in consciousness or conscious orientation from this simple and inexpensive apparatus. Perhaps you might experiment with this tool... REMEMBERING THE FAVORITE SONGS OF THOSE AROUND YOU If you truly want to be able to rapidly and secretly influence those around you, pay close attention to the events which precede their good moods. Most everyone is far more susceptible to persuasion when they are in a positive emotional state. Begin to pay close attention and beco me aware of what puts your spouse, your boss and your close friends in a good mood. Write down the events that precede these positive mood changes and see if you can detect patterns. We are all creatures of habit and consistently follow highly ritualize d patterns — even patterns of mood swings which we are not aware of ourselves. INDUCING POWERFUL EMOTIONAL STATES This simple question, which you can ask yourself before, during, or even after negotiations, altercations, or disputes can assist you in rad ically shifting your paradigm about influence: “What can I do to induce a positive mood in this person?”"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 76 You may define “positive mood” as happiness, joy, cheerfulness, relaxation, or even indifference, depending on the circumstances. The point is to get away from trying to “win” arguments, or to “be right”. Forget that crap. You will never always be right. There will always be someone who disagrees with you. Start thinking about inducing positive emotional and psychological states in other people . This one, simple shift in your approach will work wonders for you. By regularly putting others in positive moods, they will become programmed to want to make you happy! They will end up going out of their way to help you, and not even realize they are doing it! OLFACTORY HYPNOSIS The sense of smell is incredibly powerful and rapid at inducing full - blown recollections. Have you ever walked into someone’s home and smelled that certain smell which instantaneously brought you back to a time from your pa st? That’s the power of the sense of smell when it comes to triggering very strong emotional states. The olfactory sense actually stimulates Post - Hypnotic Instructions. Strong emotional states become linked to specific smells which, when triggered, indu ce the full - blown remembered experience. You can use this to your advantage by tuning into the olfactory hypnosis experiences of others. Any time someone says to you, “That smell!!! It reminds me of when....” They just had an olfactory - induced hypnotic e xperience. A simple, single smell catapulted them back to a time in their past. When this occurs, often you will see the person “zone out” for a few seconds as they go inside and relive the memory, fully and completely. Make no mistake about it — they “go internal” and feel the feelings, see the pictures, and hear the sounds of that moment from the past. Many people become completely absorbed in that reverie. For some people, their entire frame of mind will be altered for hours as they delight in (or str uggle with) the strong emotions an memories a single smell triggered. I know I’ve had this happen to me on many occasions. I’ll smell a certain scent — sometimes a very vague scent, that sends me off into my own world of thoughts and conjures up sometimes strange, dream - like emotions. Good or bad, olfactory hypnosis is very real and you can harness its power if you pay attention to the aromas which serve as psychological - emotional triggers in those around you. Once you detect them, you can make use of them.

Influencing our children to want to do their homework and chores. Influencing our spouses to understand our point of view — just once! Persuading our co - workers to buy into the new idea that we truly believe will revolutionize the co mpany — if only you could get everyone to just try it. It is in these everyday experiences that Covert Hypnosis can be most useful. It is in these everyday situations where we most often find our thoughts and energies focused. By applying the tools of Co vert Hypnosis in the common, everyday situations where you want to get another person to think, feel, or act in a certain way, is where I believe the most satisfaction and reward can come from. I say this because it’s the little things that drive us crazy ! How many times have you said to yourself, “If I could just get this person to ____, life would be SO much easier!”? With Covert Hypnosis, it can get easier. With the tools and techniques you have learned in this book, you can depart from the futile at tempts to argue, exhort and debate that are so draining. Covert Hypnosis lets you influence others calmly, peacefully, with positive energy and entertainment. Focus on the everyday issues and I believe you will reap the greatest rewards. EDUCATION Do you remember any teachers from your childhood who, to this day bring back very fond memories? Out of the dozens of instructors, teachers, and professors that taught you, were there one or two that had the most positive impact on you? When I was a chi ld, several magical teachers came into my life over the years. These enchanting men and women had a gift that made them likable, up - beat and magnetic. I always looked forward to going to the classes taught by these few, very special educators who would e ntrance their class for an hour at a time with interesting and delightful stories, games, exercises and projects. They made learning fun! What a concept! They made the desire to learn fun. Having a good time does not mean that you don’t get the job don e. Having a good time can be imperative to getting the job done! The best teachers I ever had inspired me to want to learn more because they were electrifying, interesting, exciting and kind people. And when I think back, the best teachers — like most hi ghly effective communicators — used and continue to use, many of the tools of Covert Hypnosis. They are very Covert (Covert Model), and have the natural ability to get others talking; they use lots of stories in their teachings (Organized Multiple Stories); and they have the ability to quickly bond with their students (Verbal Breathing Synchronization and related"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 79 rapport - building tools). When I think back, most of my favorite teachers used at least three of the five tools of Covert Hypnosis. And some of th em used the other two as well. FUND RAISING Whether you are engaged as a volunteer fund raiser for political purposes, a professional fund raiser selling your services to non - profit institutions, or just trying to help the local Boy Scout troop sell r affle tickets, Covert Hypnosis can help you persuade would be contributors more easily and effectively. Every huge fund raising effort is nothing more than dozens, hundreds or thousands of individual requests for financial support. And every individual request means, in most cases, a face - to - face interaction with another human being, which, of course, is an opportunity to use the tools of Covert Hypnosis. With every door you knock on, or every telephone call you make, consciously strive to get in tune with the human being you are communicating with. Speak in the same tone and tempo as they do. Mirror their body language. Smile with the same frequency they do. Become like them, if just for a few minutes. Before you ask for their support, think to yourself, “based on what this person shows outwardly, what type of interests, beliefs and values might they espouse? What is really important to them? What questions could I ask them that may elicit these values? How could I tie their values and beliefs into an Organized Multiple Story, Encrypted Instruction, or Post - Hypnotic Instruction? Everyone has “hot buttons” — issues, causes, and ideals that are near and dear to their heart. These are generally highly emotional and serve as well - habituated, read y - made Post - Hypnotic Instructions waiting to be triggered. The key is to link these PHIs to the cause you are working for and then fire them off. There is no need to complicate matters. One or two carefully designed questions are all you need to extr act the hot buttons of others. Then artfully entwine them with your cause. SALES It does not matter what you sell — insurance, cars, candles at parties, vitamins through multi - level marketing, retail cosmetics, million dollar computer networks, or h undred million dollar airplanes, most sales involve persuading other human beings face - to - face or over the phone. Usually both. Covert Hypnosis can be used in either environment to induce powerful harmony with your prospects. If you are currently in sal es, and earn most of your income through commission, it is no secret to you that you aren’t going to sell much to anyone if they do not like you."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 80 The best sales people I have ever known had the inherent inclination of becoming like the people they were se lling. They naturally gravitated towards shaping their outward behavior to be similar to their prospects’. Once again, people do tend to like people who are like them. But the top performers are generally complicated people who have a talent for really zeroing in on the “hidden” motivation that most buyers have. If you are in sales, the absolute best thing you can do, in my opinion, is to seek out the top performer in your company (assuming their is a top performer) and persuade them to let you spend a couple of weeks with them. Not a couple of hours — two solid weeks of immersion in their daily routine. You need to pick up the subtleties — the nuances of how they really act, not how they say they act. The two are almost always like night and day. If t he person you find makes over $100,000 a year (in 1998 dollars) there is a very high probability that they use many of the skills of Covert Hypnosis and have absolutely no idea that they are expert hypnotists! Most top - notch communicators naturally use ma ny, but not all, of the tools taught in this book. After all, that’s where the tools came from — the study of highly persuasive people. One word of caution when you find a top performing salesperson to emulate: be very cautious about what you tell them r egarding books you have read or seminars and tapes you have purchased. Most high income salespeople balk at formal sales training claiming that “you can’t learn what I do from a book or seminar”. Top salespeople are very often mavericks who don’t approve of the book learning approach. Don’t let their sneers affect you. As good as the top producers are at selling, they are notoriously bad at teaching what they do. That’s why you can listen to them — they cannot tell you how to do what they do. You have to observe them in action. And many excellent sales training courses and books were authored by non - sales types who couldn’t sell their way out of a paper bag, but are exceptionally adept at decoding precisely what great sales people really do and then d elineating the specifics step by step. Such delineation can prove to be extremely helpful to both the rookie salesperson as well as they seasoned veteran. Always keep an open mind, and stay hungry for continuing education. Constantly seek out opportuni ties to hang around with top producers from all different fields. NEGOTIATION You can negotiate virtually anything. Most people do not realize this. Many things that do not appear to be negotiable in fact are. And negotiation isn’t just about getting more (money, benefits, length of contract, etc.) for yourself, your side, your client or the organization you work for or represent, or giving up less. Negotiation is also about conflict resolution. And many conflicts do not involve money or financial is sues at all. Take for example the couple that keeps fighting about the same issues — month after month after month. Or the x - friends that had a falling out and haven’t spoken to each other in years. Or the neighbors that once were friendly with each othe r and now avoid any contact"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 81 whatsoever, and when they accidentally run into each other they don’t speak but just shoot cold stares back and forth. Such animosity can often be resolved through effective conflict resolution strategies, and Covert Hypnosis c an play a part in such mediation. LAW ENFORCEMENT If you are an officer of the law, the right voice inflection along with properly chosen words can help you lessen the intense emotions of recalcitrant citizens. Skillfully constructed stories may be u sed to convince a lawbreaker to surrender himself. And Post - Hypnotic Instructions might be used to induce sub - conscious flashes of fierce consequences assisting speeders in controlling their wayward and dangerous behavior. For example you might tell a speeder, once you’ve given them their ticket and are about to let them go, a short story about a person who was speeding and ended up causing a horrible wreck that killed three people. As your vivid and graphic story comes to a close, you could end with t his emotion - triggering thought (Say these words S - L - O - W - L - Y and deliberately with special inflection on the word “think”): “And the next time that you even think about exceeding the speed limit I wouldn’t want you to think too quickly, and imagine it viv idly NOW about how your speeding could cause a terrible car crash that could leave someone tragically paralyzed from the neck down, for the rest of their life.” This, of course, is only an example. What other emotion - inducing and behavior - altering applic ations of CH can you think of that may be useful in a law enforcement context? Just use your imagination and let the ideas flow... CREATIVITY/OPTIONS When a person gets “stuck” in any area of life, e.g. a bad relationship, a limited job, an un - fulfilling personal life, a lack of excitement, etc., that sense of “stuck - ness” comes from having too few options of possibility, or a lack of belief about being able to succeed with one or more of those options. You can help people expand their mental “zone of po ssibility” by covertly hypnotizing them and telling them story after story after story about people who were in similar situations and who chose creative new routes to follow in pursuit of finding satisfaction in their lives. Mind - expanding vague, genera l phrases can be very valuable when interspersed within your tales of possibility. Such nebulous phrases include: “Taking chances” “When God closes doors, he opens up windows. Now it was up to her to make the effort to go through it.” “Really feeling th at the time was right for something new”"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 82 “Knowing that the strange feeling in her stomach was a sign that now is the time for action” “And then he wondered, “What will happen if I don’t try this now?” “All her life, she had been conservative — was now the time to make a bold move? Yes! Now is the time!” “And them Mark pondered this thought, “What will this cost me if I don’t say yes to this chance?” “Wondering...a year from now do I want to be in the same place I am today?” “If not now, when?” Phrases li ke those above do not directly suggest any specific action but suggest action itself. It’s up to the listener to “fill in” what action needs to be taken, or what the consequences will be if no action is taken. Such vague generalities that suggest directi on but do not give precise “how to” instructions require the listener to draw the specifics of “how” from their unique personal experience and circumstances. This approach lets you assist someone in moving forward without telling them what to do. INTERPRE TATIONS Years ago, as a freshman in college, I took a course on communications that explained how we each develop our own “mosaic” of reality. Everything we hear, everything we see, everything we touch or taste is filtered through our own perceptual fil ters based on our different happenings in life, what we have or have not been exposed to, strong intellectual and/or emotional influences, etc. This is why each one of us experiences reality in a different way than the rest of us. My map of the territory is very different from yours. And your map of reality is very different from those around you. Because we all have different mosaics of perception and reality, we, quite naturally, interpret events differently from one another. Covert Hypnosis can he lp bridge some of those differences by fostering a sense of commonality between dissimilar views. One way to do this is by weaving examples of people trying to “see things from each others perspectives” into a series of Organized Multiple Stories. The genuine desire to try and see things from another perspective is the essence of succeeding in doing so, regardless of the specific techniques employed. Engendering such genuine desire can be facilitated through stories containing numerous vivid and descri ptive examples of people striving to experiment with new viewpoints on the issue. One way to do this is by telling a story about a Republican and a Democrat who vehemently disagreed on almost everything. In order to try and lessen the dissension betwe en them, both agreed to try and see the other’s viewpoint by arguing that view. In other words, the democrat would argue the republican’s position, and the republican would argue the democrat’s position. "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 83 To make the experience as real as possible, each person would take on the other’s body language, and use voice inflection similar to their counterpart. Both parties endeavored to truly experience the passion and commitment the other showed. And what happened? The republican developed a new sense of understanding and respect for the democrat, and vice - versa. Both became more tolerant and better able to comprehend the other’s true intentions. Both became better able to see the positive outcomes desired by the “other” who used to be the enemy. In th e end, the republican and the democrat were able to work together much more effectively, pursuing outcome beneficial and acceptable to both sides. In fact, no longer were they on opposing sides; instead, they had joined together to achieve good for all pa rties concerned. Did they continue to disagree on some issues? OF course. Did they have some irreconcilable issues? Absolutely. Were there occasional heated debates. Yes there were, and are today. But those differences no longer prevent them from mov ing forward towards shared ideals 80% of the time. DATING The single person will find that striking up a conversation using the tools of CH is extremely easy. Establishing rapport on first or second dates becomes a piece of cake when you use Verbal - Br eathing Synchronization and the related bonding techniques. And all kinds of states can be induced through Organized Multiple Stories, Encrypted Instructions and Post - Hypnotic Instructions. When I was single, I applied Verbal - Breathing Synchronization o n many first dates, and routinely had women say to me, “There’s just something about you — I feel like I’ve known you all my life!”. It really is incredible to elicit these kinds of responses regularly and by design. HAPPINESS If you know someone who jus t can’t seem to find their way out of a rut, an individual who seems to walk around with a cloud over their head, why not covertly hypnotize them? Perhaps you could tell them stories about people who suddenly became captivated by an exciting new hobby tha t they, in a flash, found themselves deeply absorbed in. Tell them story after story. Give them example after example. Try multiple approaches. Mail them a good set of motivational tapes — anonymously. I can’t tell you how fortunate I feel to have stu mbled upon a set of Zig Ziglar tapes when I was 19. I listened to those tapes over and over and over again, and am convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that Zig’s message seeped into my subconscious mind and persuaded me to embrace a set of beliefs that o pened up many new doors and sent me on a path of possibility. I believe that the repetition of listening to examples of “rags to riches” stories covertly hypnotized me into believing that I could emulate those I heard about."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 84 You very well may be able to h elp a friend or relative get out of a rut and onto a road to happiness and productivity by becoming entranced by stories of possibility, whether those stories are your own, or from a great motivator. INTERVIEWING/JOB HUNTING The next time you go on an i nterview, whether it is for a new job, a loan, venture capital, or for any other reason, you can gain stack the deck in your favor if you use the tools of Covert Hypnosis. You will be delightfully surprised to discover how people of all positions will go out of their way to help you if they have that special feeling inside about you. A lack of experience can be over looked, and a less than ideal credit rating can become “insignificant” compared to your other highly desirable traits (whatever they subject ively perceive those traits to be). What really matters is that the person you are sitting across from gets a powerful feeling in their gut that you are like them — and of course you know precisely how to induce this feeling. Once rapport has been establi shed, ask the interviewer to recall a time when an ideal, or close to ideal, candidate applied for a job with them and was offered the position. Ask them about details of that experience. Get them to go inside and mentally and emotionally re - live that ti me. As they do, set up your trigger. Then, subtly, during your answers to their questions, fire off that trigger and induce those same wonderful feelings in them again. Don’t be afraid to use CH on receptionists, administrative assistants, and everyone else you come in contact with during the course of your interviewing. The more people whom you favorable impress, the better your odds of success are.

They all want to influence you to do something that will benefit them. The minister wants you to join his church and learn the “true” way to heaven. The pol itician wants you to vote for him and buy in to his political ideology. The insurance salesman wants you to sign a contract and give him a big fat check so that he can earn a large commission. Persuasion is everywhere. But there are others who want to i nfluence you as well. Your boss wants to persuade you to support his ideas and programs. Your coworkers want to persuade you to agree with them on opinions they hold regarding the company or specific managers. Your friends want to persuade you to accomp any them to certain events, movies and shopping excursions. Persuasion is everywhere. But there are other, less obvious examples of people who want to persuade you, and people who persuade those you care about. For example, your child’s friends. They i nfluence your child — perhaps more than you realize. Who has more influence, you or the friends? For some of you, this is a difficult question to answer truthfully. Persuasion is everywhere. Advertisers want to sell you more goods and services. Politici ans want to sell you their ideas. Religious leaders want to sell you the way to salvation. And drug dealers want to sell your children drugs. The list goes on and on. Persuasion is everywhere. Call it what you want. Persuasion. Influence. Salesmans hip. Manipulation. The bottom line is the same thing: one person trying to get another person to do what they want them to do. The techniques persuaders use vary largely. Some persuaders are crude and blatant. Others are very sophisticated and pol ished. But again, their purpose is the same — to get you to behave in a way that they want. WHAT MAKES PERSUASION GOOD OR BAD? Generally, we tend to agree with the persuaders that share the same values and beliefs that we share. If you are a conservative Christian, for example, you probably esteem Pat Robertson. You probably think he is a good man, doing the right thing. Robertson is a very compelling persuader. He uses many forms of influence because he fervently believes in his work. But if you ar e a liberal, you probably think Robertson is a fanatic — you may even think he’s dangerous. As a liberal, you may even resent Robertson for attempting to restrict your freedom. "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 87 The Catholics and the Protestants. The Israelis and the Arabs. The Republican s and the Democrats — all are examples of long - running, intensely fought differences. Differences of opinion. Differences of belief. Differences of value. Differences of principle. It all comes down to what you believe in based on your deepest principa ls and values. And how we develop our values is a subject that would takes more room than this entire book to discuss adequately. But that’s not our purpose here. Our purpose is to make clear that persuasion, influence, and manipulations are all around us all of the time. We all use and are subject to influence. Some of us are more inclined to want to persuade others. Some of us are more skilled at doing so. But what determines if our persuasive endeavors are “right” or “good” or “moral” depends not on the tools and techniques that we use, but on our values and principles. And the principles we embrace our constantly subject to attack and disputation. WHO BENEFITS? WHO IS HARMED? It is my belief that persuasion is good if it helps the person you are persuading. It is also my belief that persuasion is bad if it harms the person you are using it on. It is my sincere admonition that you ask yourself this question before attempting to persuade another human being into doing anything, regardless of t he techniques you use: Is what I am considering doing truly in the best interest of all parties concerned? If not, re - think your possibilities and develop new alternatives. Postpone taking action until you come up with an approach that is in the best i nterest of all parties involved. One that you honestly feel good about. Whatever you do, always obey the law, consult your conscience, and, above all, do no harm.

I have asked those same questions myself many times during the discovery and development of Covert Hy pnosis. I know from my own experience what kind of results the application of Covert Hypnosis can yield. I know what Covert Hypnosis has done for me. And, in the final analysis, only you can prove that Covert Hypnosis works — or does not work — for you. O nly you can prove to yourself that the techniques are genuine, effective, and useful — and only you will know that they are effective for you in your life. Here’s why: There are three primary categories of “proof”: scientific study, testimonial, and person al experience. Each one has its pros and cons, and we will take a look at the value — as well as the imperfections of each method of “proof”. Scientific studies are often conducted in university research laboratories. A researcher develops a theory and designs an experiment to prove that the theory is valid (or disprove it, as the case may be). The researcher then seeks an abundance of evidence to back up the validity of his or her assertion. There are two fundamental categories of social/psychologi cal research — quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative studies seek to document measurable differences in large groups, or large numbers of small groups. Quantitative studies take into consideration lots of people and document recurring patterns, usuall y patterns the researcher is endeavoring to demonstrate the existence of. Qualitative studies, in contrast, usually involve a very small study population (as small as a single participant, better known as a case study), but with great time and effort put into the details and particulars of the individual(s) being studied. Quantitative analysis is generally considered more “scientific” than qualitative as it better lends itself to objectivity — the same trait or pattern is observed and documented in “contr olled” conditions, repeatedly. This is its upside. Qualitative analysis, on the other hand, better lends itself to subjectivity by its very nature. One researcher is studying one subject, (or other small sample population) and this group size, by scie ntific standards, is not considered statistically significant. Moreover, it is very easy for the researcher to “read in” what he or she is hoping to find. Qualitative studies also provide a convenient environment for the researcher to directly influence the outcome of the experiment. That is to say, he or she may directly or indirectly, consciously or unconsciously sway the individual they are supposed to be observing."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 89 The upside to qualitative study is it provides an ideal atmosphere for in - depth probi ng and affords the conveniences of recording large quantities of data about the individual subject — something hardly feasible for a quantitative study involving hundreds, perhaps thousands, of participants. Typically, in social or psychological quantitati ve research experimentation, two groups are created, the control group, and the experimental group. Usually, in well - designed studies, every effort is made to keep potential variables as constant as possible in both groups. This is so that when the one v ariable that is being tested is introduced into the experimental group, it is easy to accurately measure the difference in outcome between the control group and the experimental group. If a scientific study is indeed well designed, well conducted, careful ly documented and properly interpreted, its results can be extremely valuable. The scientific study of social and psychological effects of specific criteria can help to point us in the right direction of what is genuinely effective or ineffective, helpful or harmful, useful or fruitless — and not only in the social sciences of course, in many other fields as well. I firmly believe that scientific study is a valuable and worthy endeavor, and I sincerely welcome the empirical study of Covert Hypnosis. I have not scientifically evaluated Covert Hypnosis, but would encourage anyone interested in doing so to move forward with enthusiasm and alacrity. But scientific experimentation is not all that it’s cracked up to be. Scientific study had a downside — and a dar k side as well. The downside is that far too often, because a study is published in a professional journal, or conducted by an individual with impressive credentials, the study is received as gospel. And it just isn’t so. There is a tremendous amount of room for error, omission, erroneous conclusion, bias, and subjectivity in scientific studies. Even the most thoroughly prepared and carefully controlled experiments end up not “proving” anything, but merely suggesting indications, trends, tendencies, a nd the like. Even when something, such as a medication, is “clinically proven” to be effective in reducing specific symptoms, generally it’s for a certain percentage of those involved in the study, not for the entire experimental group. For example, a pain reliever may be “clinically proven to reduce or eliminate headaches in 73% of study participants”. That means that 27% did not get relief at all! Which means, although the drug is “clinically proven to be effective”, there is a 27% chance that it w ill not work at all for you! The dark side of scientific experimentation is that there are those scientists who want so bad to prove that their theory is correct, that they either consciously or unconsciously influence the outcome of their study to get the result they want. There are many ways this can be done, from subtly making testing controls “looser” rather than “tighter”, to unconsciously selecting more favorable test subjects, to boldly mis - recording data. It does happen."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 90 Replication is supposed to be the check in place that prevents “bad science” from making it into the main stream. The theory is that if your peers (other researchers) can consistently duplicate results similar to yours, using the same research protocol that you used, then your fin dings are valid. If your peers attempt to duplicate your study and end up with dissimilar results, or inconsistent results, then your research is deemed invalid, unconvincing, and groundless. Again, I believe that scientific research is a good thing, but I also believe that it is crucial to interpret scientific studies with good critical thinking skills. When I was a senior in college I conducted several studies or my own (being a Behavioral Science major), including a study about studies, and came to th e conclusion that scientific studies in the psychological and social sciences do not “prove” anything, but can, if well designed and well implemented, suggest patterns, trends, and inclinations. And of course, any scientific findings are subject to interp retation and context. Existing Literature on Indirect Hypnosis There is an enormous amount of literature on the subject of indirect hypnosis. The articles and books written by Milton Erickson, M.D. alone constitute vast evidence of its existence and us efulness. Erickson documented hundreds of case histories where he used indirect approaches to hypnosis, as well as other fascinating non - hypnotic indirect communication strategies. In addition to Erickson’s seminal work, dozens of other books and articl es have been published on the methods, uses and successes of indirect hypnosis. Such works include manuals for hypnotherapy courses, books on selling and salesmanship, as well as articles found in both professional scientific and lay publications. The i nterested reader will find dozens of entries in library databases (look under hypnosis; there will be sub - headings for “indirect”). The vast body of existing literature on indirect methods gives much credibility to the basic principles of this approach to hypnosis. The next major category of proof is testimonial evidence. Testimony is offered by individuals who have had a positive (or negative) experience with a specific product, service, organization, belief, idea — whatever — it can be anything. Testi monials are given by those willing to attest to the validity of a specific thing. Testimonials are the personal experience of others. Testimonial evidence, of course, has an upside as well as a down side. The upside of testimonial evidence is that if large numbers of people attest to the validity of a claim (e.g. where a defendant was at a specific time, the benefits of a product or service, or the character of a political candidate) we often tend to be swayed by their claims. Many people backing up a claim offers social validation to the claim. "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 91 The downside of testimonial evidence is that just because one person (or persons) believes something — according to their perceptions, values, principles, etc — doesn’t necessarily mean that you will agree with them. Nor does it mean that you will have a similar experience. We are all so different in many ways. Just because I — and three of my best friends — tell you that a certain restaurant is “the best” does not mean that you will like it. Nonetheless, testi monial evidence is used by lawyers, marketers, and persuaders of all types every day. It does have very real power. That doesn’t mean, however, that it offers irrefutable proof. Personal experience is the final major category of proof. Personal experi ence is the most relied upon form of proof there is. Think about the decisions that you make regularly in your life. What evidence do you use to make most of your decisions? Consider these five examples: 1. The jobs you have chosen. 2. The over the counter me dications you choose. 3. The stores that you patronize. 4. The experts whose advice you follow. 5. The type of milk that you buy. Let’s examine the first one — the jobs you have chosen. Assuming you are employed, why did you select the job you are currently in? D id the company convince you to accept the position with a scientific study which showed that 93% of all employees at the firm were satisfied with their jobs? Did the company offer any type of scientific evidence? Or did you base you decision on testimon ial evidence? Did the company show you a video of various employees attesting to the excellent work environment, outstanding benefits and opportunities for growth? Or did you base your decision on personal experience — a gut feeling — that the company was th e right one for you? What really made you decide to take the job — scientific evidence, testimonial evidence, or personal experience? How about example #2, over the counter medications. Every single drug approved by the FDA must undergo extensive scientif ic testing to prove, among other things, that the drug is more effective than a placebo. How many of the scientific studies have you read? Have you, and do you continue to, base your decision to use a specific drug, such as a pain reliever, on the scien tific evidence that the drug works? Or do you base your decision on what other people tell you works? Or do you rely on your own personal experience, have tried several, and continuing to buy the one that has proven to work best for you? If you are lik e 90% of the people I have asked the above two questions to, you rely primarily on your own personal experience when making such decisions. Let’s continue with the rest of our examples. Why do you shop at certain stores? Does scientific proof have any thing to do with it? Is it because other people you know and respect shop their? Or is it because you just like those stores? "},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 92 How about expert advice. For every “expert” out there claiming that their approach to diets, managing finances, relationships , etc. is better that the rest, there is another “expert” claiming the opposite. Which ones do you believe? Why? The final example, where you buy your milk (assuming that you drink milk) is my favorite because milk is about as simple and as basic as i t gets. Where do you buy your milk? Why? I will tell you that the milk that I buy is purchased because I like the way that it tastes and it’s bought at the store that is most convenient to me at the time. I have never read a research report on milk, an d I do not care what type of milk my neighbor buys. I buy a specific brand of milk because I have had good personal experience with that brand. I like it and it serves me well. I suspect that your reasons are similar. How we “prove” things in every day life, for the most part, has nothing to do with science. For some people, testimonial evidence often is very persuasive, but by and large, the ultimate form of proof is our own personal experience. To each individual, personal experience is real and ver ifiable. And it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks. We know what works for us and we know what does not work, for us. Only you can prove that Covert Hypnosis will work — for you. If there were studies that “proved” CH is effective, they would not pro ve that it would work for all people in all circumstances. At best such studies would suggest that the basic principles are effective with a certain percentage of people in a very specific context. I want you to be the judge. Learn the tools inside an d out. Put them to use. Then judge for yourself.

I call it Covert Collaboration. Train two friends, co - workers, or co - conspirators how to covertly hypnotize and then synchronize your approaches and begin to multiply the effect of Covert hypnosis! Appendix II The E.A.S. Technique E.A.S. stands for “Eye, Arm, Side”, and is an incredibly clever method of using a long - standing traditional stage hypnosis technique on your subject without them know ing it!!!. If you add the word “Youth”, the method becomes really E.A.S.Y. to remember...Eye, Arm, Side, Youth....E.A.S.Y., don’t you think? Here’s what the acronym means: Eye Arm Side Youth Let me explain: You ask your subject to play a little game with you (after you have established rapport by starting a conversation, through verbal - breathing synchronization, mirroring, etc. Next you ask your subject to close their eyes . Next you ask your subject to lift their arm up over their head. Then you tell yo ur subject to let their arm slowly and gently drift down to their side only as quickly as they can fully remember a very pleasant experience from their youth . That’s the induction. Quick, simple, and E.A.S.Y. Try it. I think you’ll like it. Here are some tips for making the most of this rapid hypnotic inducer: 1. When you ask the subject to remember a very pleasant experience from their youth, if they hesitate, suggest that they must have at least one time from their youth when they were very happy, ev en if it was just for five minutes. (There are those people who claim they have no pleasant memories from their childhood. These folks choose to"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 103 remember only the bad stuff. Everyone has had some good, and some great experiences, even if they don’t real ize it. Gently push them to remember a specific time). 2. If they persist with their claim of “no pleasant experiences”, ask them to use their imagination and pretend what it would be like to have a pleasant memory from their youth. 3. When they begin rememb ering the experience, give them suggestions for making the experience more real and more intense, e.g. “make the images bigger and brighter. Bring the pictures up closer and make them more clearly focused. Turn up the sound and let the experience become louder”, etc. 4. If they move their arm down towards their side too quickly, reach out and grab it and tell them to go slowly — S — L — O — W — L — Y. 5. When their arm does touch their side, give them a post - hypnotic instruction and then tell them to open their eyes. A ppendix III The Handshake Induction This is a powerful, 100% non - verbal, rapid induction technique that you will come to love. To induce an altered state with only a handshake, reach out to hold your subject’s hand as you normally would. After two or t hree typical up and down motions, begin to let go of the subject’s hand — just for a millisecond, only letting go of your grasp slightly. Then quickly re - grasp fully. Then release your grasp again — and quickly re - grasp applying slightly more pressure with on e finger than the rest. Then release your grasp a third time — only slightly — and then re - grasp their hand one final time, this time applying slight pressure with a different finger. While you are doing these “finger gymnastics”, gaze directly into your sub ject’s eyes and then, with your final grasp, move your gaze slightly above their head and behind them — as if you were looking right through them. What the handshake induction does is induce an altered state through confusion. Handshakes are normally quite normal. No surprises in most shakes of the hand. But with the hypnotic handshake, you start to let go...then re - grasp. Then start to let go...and re - grasp — but differently. Then start to let go...and re - grasp again. This sudden unusual behavior confuses you r subject, making them “go inside” and try to figure out what they should do. Essentially, this technique temporarily knocks them off their mental balance. When you gaze directly into their eyes, they typically will use your stare as a focal point. By t ransitioning your gaze to slightly above and behind them, you give the appearance that you"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 104 are looking right through them, also a slightly bizarre and slightly disconcerting behavior. The subject is caught between the habitual response of a typically very normal and automatic experience and the strange and unexpected twist you have thrown at them. An inwardly - focused altered state results. As soon as you shift your gaze to above and behind them, immediately begin an organized multiple story. They will quickly become entranced.

Many of my customers have written to thank me for teaching hypnosis in a way that makes learning easy, and I have been deeply gratified by the comments my customers have provided about my courses. Some students have written to say that they have studied hypnosis for years, but not until they studied my videos did “it all come together”. Doctors and Psychologists, in addition to lay people who have zero prior experience in hypnosis, have written expressing thanks for my clear and concise instruction — and have been so enthusiastic about my courses that they have given me permission to use their comments as testimonials (please see my other e - bay auctions).

After numerous requests from customers to create a Certification course, I am please to anno unce my new Professional Hypnosis Certification Course, presented by The Institute for the advanced Study of Hypnotism – A Division of Hypnosis Secrets, Inc. This brand new Certification course is different from all others on the market in a number of impo rtant ways. Specifically: • This can be done by anyone • No special skills are necessary • You don't need prior training • No complicated system • No over - priced, drawn - out courses • Certification is guaranteed While most hypnosis certification courses cost betwee n $400 and $5,000, my course sells for only $199. I’ve priced my certification course very reasonably. I can do this because I have intentionally eliminated the long, drawn - out, boring lectures that most courses include. I’ve also made a very conscious eff ort to not include un - proven theory that most hypnosis instructors thrive on. You won’t get any mumbo jumbo or hocus - pocus in this concise, evidence - based, fast - paced program. You will get a large amount of scientifically proven, factual and contemporary i nstruction on hypnosis, including how it works, how to use it on yourself and others, along with specific step - by - step instructions for the application of hypnosis in many areas. Warning! This Course is NOT for Everyone! In the Accelerated Professional Hypnosis Certification Course I cover a lot of information quickly. The course contents are presented in an accelerated manner. If you like fast - paced instruction, and like to apply what you learn immediately, this course is definitely right up your alley. Consider buying it right now. On the other hand, if you like to be “hand held” and don’t pick up on new ideas too quickly, I would advise you to seek instruction elsewhere. People who learn quickly and want only the finest instruction in hypnosis — without all of the unnecessary drawn - out lectures and unproven theory will want to buy this course immediately. In this fascinating course you will learn more about hypnosis, why it works, how it really works, and exactly what to say and do in this program than in the expensive, drawn - out courses that cost an arm and a leg. How You Can Benefit From My Expense: "},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"COVERT HYPNOSIS ________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ Bill O’Connell 109 Over the years I have spent thousands of dollars on hypnosis courses, books, tapes and seminars. Through experience I have determined what is valuable a nd what is a waste of time. Because I have spent all of this money on programs and independent research, you don’t have to. You benefit because of my expense. I will teach you what works, what is proven scientifically, and teach you exactly what to say and do. But I’ll go even further, and NOT waste your time with unproven nonsense and long - boring lectures. A Little - Known Secret: My certifications are from two of the largest and best known hypnosis organizations in the world, The American Board of Hypnot herapy and The National Guild of Hypnotists. In my course I will teach you how I became certified by these organizations, and reveal to you a little - known secret that will allow you to become certified by them as well. This is a secret that I have not reve aled in any of my other programs, and it’s one that can save you a great deal of money. I will tell you all about it, in detail, in this course. I’ve taken a good hard look at different programs being offered. I’ve studied some of the most successful, mo st respected hypnotists in the world. I’ll let you in on a little secret: there is a lot of nonsense being peddled to the unsuspecting consumer when it comes to hypnosis. A lot of what is taught in many hypnosis programs, including those that cost $1,500 t o $5,000 is pure bunk. Nonsense. Hocus pocus. Unproven theory. Breakthroughs in the Understanding of Hypnosis: Recent discoveries in research have shed a great deal of light on how and why hypnosis really works. The old fashioned theories have been disp roven and discredited. Modern scientific studies have systematically, repeatedly and consistently proven the underpinnings of hypnosis. And I will share these discoveries with you in my course. You will learn what works...and how to avoid what does not. The course includes all of the information, exercises and self - directed study that you need to be able to successfully hypnotize anyone (including yourself) and assist them with general self - improvement changes they seek (smoking cessation, non - medical we ight loss, stress reduction, sports improvement, motivation, etc.) What You Will Receive: The Accelerated Professional Hypnosis Certification Course is presented on one (1) VHS Video, six (6) audio cassettes, and a bound training manual.
