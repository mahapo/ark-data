I cannot entirely vouch for its authenticity. Disclosure of the sources from which it is drawn would undoubtedly lead to great difficulties for them. And in matters of this k ind the Soviet is not accustomed to the issuance of validations. Having compiled this volume I did not easily discover any method of distributing it since my own facilities and finances are, as is customary with professors, necessarily limited. Further, t he placement of this volume in anyone's hands constituted to some degree a considerable risk to myself until I realized that there actually were two American groups in the field of mental science who were entirely above suspicion, particularly since they w ere often mentioned as Soviet targets by my informers and were mentioned in the actual text of this book as being antipathetic to this Soviet programme. These two groups were the Christian Scientists and the Dianeticists. Christian Science is an American R eligion, intensely patriotic. Dianetics is the only entirely American development in the field of the human mind. Knowing from my information sources that Dianetics and Christian Science and their people have experienced years of mauling and defamation at Communist hands, I am submitting to these organizations this work. I wish to express here my appreciation for their bold resistance to Communism through the years. I wish also to express my confidence in the future of the free nations of earth. Although the soviet has found a chink in the armour of individual liberty, it is certain that Democratic processes can mend it. That only the individual himself can protest against assault and injury to him before law, joined with the fact that the insane have no r ights before law, has permitted in itself this deep ingress into our country's security. So long as this legal hole exists, there is then no law against driving anyone insane, even though this"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 3 action deals as finally with a person as does murder. The exist ence today of highly efficient drugs such as LSD, one - millionth of an ounce of which can create insanity, brings this legal loophole into focus. By enacting legislation permitting a friend or next of kin to bring charges in case of assault, and by quickly placing all treatment of and institutions for the insane in the hands of ministers, taking it entirely out of the hands of European indoctrinated practitioners, the entire effort of psychopolitics can be nullified at once. If you care to check this subjec t of psychopolitics against current occurrences in the American scene you will discover the urgency of such measures.

Psychopolitics is an important if less known div ision of Geo - politics. It is less known because it must necessarily deal with highly educated personnel, the very top strata of \"mental healing\". By psychopolitics our chief goals are effectively carried forward. To produce a maximum of chaos in the cultu re of the enemy is our first most important step. Our fruits are <grow> in chaos, distrust, economic depression and scientific turmoil. At <least> a weary populace can seek peace only in our offered Communist State, at last only Communism can resolve the p roblems of the masses. A psychopolitician must work hard to produce the maximum chaos in the fields of \"mental healing\". He must recruit and use all the agencies and facilities of \"mental healing\". He must labour to increase the personnel and facilities o f \"mental healing\" until at last the entire field of mental science is entirely dominated by Communist principles and desires. To achieve these goals the psychopolitician must crush every \"home - grown\" variety of mental healing in America. Actual teachings of Freud, James, Eddy and others amongst your misguided peoples must be swept away. They must be discredited, defamed, arrested, stamped upon even by their own government until there is no credit in them and only Communist - oriented \"healing\" remains. You must work until every teacher of psychology unknowingly or knowingly teaches only Communist doctrine under the guise of \"psychology\". You must labour until every doctor and psychiatrist is either a psychopolitician or an unwitting assistant to our aims. Y ou must labour until we have dominion over the minds and bodies of every important person in your nation. You must achieve such disrepute for the state of insanity and such authority over its pronouncement that not one statesman so labelled could again be given credence by his people. You must work until suicide arising from mental imbalance is common and calls forth no general investigation or remark. With the institutions for the insane you have in your country prisons which can hold a million persons an d can hold them without civil rights or any hope of freedom. And upon these people can be practiced shock and surgery so that never again will they draw a sane breath. You must make these treatments common and accepted. And you must sweep aside any treatme nt or any group of persons seeking to treat by effective means. You must dominate as respected men the fields of psychiatry and psychology. You must dominate the hospitals and universities. You must carry forward the myth that only a European doctor is co mpetent in the field of insanity and thus excuse amongst you the high incidence of foreign birth and training. If and when we seize Vienna you shall have"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 6 then a common ground of meeting and can come and take your instructions as worshippers of Freud along with other psychiatrists. 3 Psychopolitics is a solemn charge. With it you can erase our enemies as insects. You can cripple the efficiency of leaders by striking insanity into their families through the use of drugs. You can wipe them away with testimo ny as to their insanity. By our technologies you can even bring about insanity itself when they seem too resistive. You can change their loyalties by psychopolitics. Given a short time with a psychopolitician you can alter forever the loyalty of a soldier in out hands or a statesman or a leader in his own country, or you can destroy his mind. However you labour under certain dangers. It may happen that remedies for our \"treatments\" may be discovered. It may occur that a public hue and cry may arise agains t \"mental healing\". It may thus occur that all mental healing might be placed in the hands of ministers and be taken out of the hands of our psychologists and psychiatrists. But the Capitalistic thirst for control, Capitalistic inhumanity and a general pub lic terror of insanity can be brought to guard against these things. But should they occur, should independent researchers actually discover means to undo psychopolitical procedures, you must not rest, you must not eat or sleep, you must not stint one tini est bit of available money to campaign against it, discredit it, strike it down and render it void. For by an effective means all our actions and researches could be undone. In a Capitalistic state you are aided on all sides by the corruption of the philo sophy of man and the times. You will discover that everything will aid you in your campaign to seize, control and use all \"mental healing\" to spread our doctrine and rid us of our enemies within their own borders. Use the courts, use the judges, use the C onstitution of the country, use its medical societies and its laws to further our ends. Do not stint in your labour in this direction. And when you have succeeded you will discover that you can now effect your own legislation at will and you can, by carefu l organization of healing societies, by constant campaign about the terrors of society, by <pretence> as to your effectiveness make your Capitalist himself, by his own appropriations, finance a large portion of the quiet Communist conquest of the nation. By psychopolitics create chaos. Leave a nation leaderless. Kill our enemies. And bring to Earth, through Communism, the greatest peace Man has ever known. Thank you. 4 "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 7 CHAPTER I THE HISTORY AND DEFINITION OF PSYCHOPOLITICS Although punishment for its o wn sake may not be entirely without recompense, it is, nevertheless, true that the end and goal of all punishment is the indoctrination of the person being punished with an idea, whether that idea be one of restraint or obedience. In that any ruler has, f rom time beyond memory, needed the obedience of his subjects in order to accomplish his ends, he has thus resorted to punishments. This is true of every tribe and state in the history of Man. Today, Russian culture has evoked more certain and definite meth ods of aligning and securing the loyalties of persons and populaces, and of enforcing obedience upon them. This modern out growth of old practices is called Psychopolitics. The stupidity and narrowness of nations not blessed with Russian reasoning has cau sed them to rely upon practices which are today too ancient and outmoded for the rapid and heroic pace of our time. And in view of the tremendous advance of Russian Culture in the field of mental technologies, begun with the glorious work of Pavlov and car ried forward so ably by later Russians, it would be strange that an art and science would not evolve totally devoted to the aligning of loyalties and extracting the obedience of individuals and multitudes. Thus we see that psychopolitical procedures are a natural outgrowth of practices as old as Man, practices which are current in every group of men throughout the world. Thus, in psychopolitical procedures there is no ethical problem, since it is obvious and evident that Man is always coerced against his w ill to the greater good of the State, whether by economic gains or indoctrination into the wishes and desires of the State. Basically, Man is an animal. He is an animal which has been given a civilized veneer. Man is a collective animal, grouped together for his own protection before the threat of the environment. Those who so group and control him must the have in 5 their possession Specialized techniques to direct the vagaries and energies of the animal Man toward greater efficiency in the accomplishm ent of the goals of the State. Psychopolitics, in one form or other, has long been used in Russia, but the subject is all but unknown outside the borders of our nation, save only where we have carefully transplanted our information and where it is used fo r the greater good of the nation. The definition of Psychopolitics follows."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 8 Psychopolitics is the art and science of asserting and maintaining dominion over the thoughts and loyalties of individuals, officers, bureaux, and masses, and the effecting of th e conquest of enemy nations through \"mental healing\". The subject of Psychopolitics breaks down into several categories, each a natural and logical proceeding from the last. Its first subject is the constitution and anatomy of Man himself as a political o rganism. The next is an examination of Man as a economic organism, as this might be controlled by his desires. The next is classification of State goals for the individual and masses. The next is an examination of loyalties. The next is the general subject of obedience. The next is the anatomy of the stimulus - response mechanisms of Man. The next is the subject of shock and endurance. The next is categories of experience. The next is the catalyzing and aligning of experience. The next is the use of drugs. Th e next is implantation. The next is the general application of Psychopolitics within Russia. The next is the organization and use of counter - Psychopolitics. The next is the use of Psychopolitics in the conquest of foreign nations. The next is psychopolitic al organizations outside Russia, their composition and activity. The next is the creation of slave philosophy in an hostile nation. The next is countering anti - psychopolitical activities abroad, and the final one, the destiny of psychopolitical rule in a s cientific age. To this might be added many subcategories, such as the nullification of modern weapons by psychopolitical activity. The strength and power of Psychopolitics cannot be overestimated, particularly when used in a nation decayed by pseudointell ectualism, where exploitation of the masses combines readily 6 with psychopolitical actions, and particularly where the greed of Capitalistic or Monarchial regimes has already brought about an overwhelming incidence of neurosis which can be employed as the groundwork for psychopolitical action and a psycho - political corps. It is part of your mission, student, to prevent psychopolitical activity to the detriment of the Russian State, just as it is your mission to carry forward in our nation and outside it, if you are so assigned, the missions and goals of Psychopolitics. No agent of Russia could be even remotely effective without a thorough grounding in Psychopolitics, and so you carry forward with you a Russian trust to use well what you are learning he re. 7 CHAPTER II THE CONSTITUTION OF MAN AS A POLITICAL ORGANISM Man is already a colonial aggregation of cells, and to consider him an individual would be an error. Colonies of cells have gathered together as one organ or another of the body,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 9 and then these organs have, themselves, gathered together to form the whole. Thus we see that man himself is already a political organism, even if we do not consider a mass of men. Sickness could be considered to be a disloyalty to the remaining organisms on the p art of one organism. This disloyalty, becoming apparent, brings about a revolt of some part of the anatomy against the remaining whole, and thus we have, in effect, an internal revolution. The heart, becoming disaffected, falls away from close membership a nd service to the remainder of the organism, and we discover the entire body in all of its activities is disrupted because of the revolutionary activity of the heart. The heart is in revolt because it cannot or will not co - operate with the remainder of the body. If we permit the heart thus to revolt, the kidneys, taking the example of the heart, may in their turn rebel and cease to work for the good of the organism. This rebellion, multiplying to other organs and the glandular system, brings about the death of the \"individual\". We can see with ease that the revolt is death, that the revolt of any part of the organism results in death. Thus we see that there can be no compromise with rebellion. Like the \"individual\" man, the State is a collection of aggregat ions. The political entities within the State must, all of them, co - operate for the greater good of the State lest the State itself fall asunder and die; for with the disaffection of any single distrust we discover an example set for other districts, and w e discover, at length, the entire State falling. This is the danger of revolution. Look at earth. We see here one entire organism. The organism of Earth is an individual organism. Earth has as its organs the 8 various races and nations of men. Where on e of these is permitted to remain disaffected, Earth itself is threatened with death. The threatened rebellion of one country, no matter how small, against the total organism of Earth, would find Earth sick, and the cultural state of man to suffer in conse quence. Thus, the putrescent illness of Capitalist States, spreading its pus and bacteria into the healthy countries of the world would not do otherwise than bring about the death of Earth, unless these ill organisms are brought into loyalty and obedience and made to function for the greater good of the world - wide State. The constitution of Man is so composed that the individual cannot function efficiently without the alignment of each and every part and organ of his anatomy. As the average individual is i ncapable in an unformed and uncultured state, as witness the barbarians of the jungle, so must be trained into a co - ordination of his organic functions by exercise, education and work toward specific goals. We particularly and specifically note that the in dividual must be directed from without to accomplish his exercise, education and work. He must be made to realize this, for only then can he be made to function efficiently in the role assigned to him."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 10 The tenets of rugged individualism, personal determin ism, self - will, imagination and personal creativeness are alike in the masses antipathetic to the good of the Greater State. These wilful and unaligned forces are no more than illness which will bring about disaffection, disunity, and at length the collaps e of the group to which the individual is attached. The constitution of Man lends itself easily and thoroughly to certain and positive regulation from without of all of its functions, including those of thinkingness, obedience, and loyalty; and these thin gs must be controlled if a greater State is to ensue. While it may seem desirable to the surgeon to amputate one or another limb or organ in order to save the remainder, it must be pointed out that this expediency is not entirely possible of accomplishmen t where one considers entire nations. A body deprived of organ can be observed to be lessened in its effectiveness. The world deprived of the workers now enslaved by the insane and nonsensical idiocies of the Capitalists and Monarchs of Earth, 9 would, if removed, create a certain disability in the world - wide State. Just as we see the victor forced to rehabilitate the population of a conquered country at the end of a war, thus any effort to depopulate a disaffected portion of the world might have some co nsequence. However, let us consider the inroad of virus and bacteria hostile to the organism, as we see that unless we can conquer the germ, the organ or organism which it is attacking will itself suffer. In any State we have certain individuals who opera te in the role of the virus and germ, and these, attacking the population or any group within the population, produce, by their self - willed greed, a sickness in the organ, which then generally spreads to the whole. The constitution of Man, as an individua l body, or the constitution of a State or a portion of the State as a political organism are analogous. It is the mission of Psychopolitics first to align the obedience and goals of the group, and then maintain their alignment by the eradication of the eff ectiveness of the persons and personalities which might swerve the group toward disaffection. In our own nation, where things are better managed and where reason reigns above all else, it is not difficult to eradicate the self - willed bacteria which might a ttack one of our political entities. But in the field of conquest, in nations less enlightened, where the Russian State does not yet have power, it is not as feasible to remove the entire self - willed individual. Psychopolitics makes it possible to remove t hat part of his personality which, in itself, is making havoc with the person's own constitution, as well as with the group with which the person is connected. If the animal man were permitted to continue undisturbed by counter - revolutionary propaganda, i f we were left to work under the well - planned management of the State, we would discover little sickness amongst Man, and we would discover no sickness in the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 11 State. But where the individual is troubled by conflicting propaganda, where he is made the effec t of revolutionary activities, where he is permitted to think thoughts critical to the State itself, where he is permitted to question those in whose natural charge he falls, we would discover his constitution to suffer. We 10 would discover, from this disaffection, the additional disaffection of his heart and of other portions of his anatomy. So certain is this principle that when one finds a sick individual, could one search deeply enough, he would discover a mis - aligned loyalty and an interrupted obed ience to the person's group unit. There are those who foolishly have embarked upon some spiritual Alice - in - Wonderland voyage into what they call the \"subconscious\" or the \"unconscious\" mind, and who, under the guise of \"psychotherapy\" would seek to make w ell the disaffection of body organs, but it is to be noted that their results are singularly lacking in success. There is no strength in such an approach. When hypnotism was first invented in Russia it was observed that all that was necessary was to comman d the unresisting individual to be well in order, many times, to accomplish that fact. The limitation of hypnotism was that many subjects were not susceptible to its uses, and thus hypnotism has had to be improved upon in order to increase the suggestibili ty of individuals who would not otherwise be reached. Thus, any nation has had the experience of growing well again, as a whole organism, when placing sufficient force in play against a disaffected group. Just as in hypnotism any organ can be commanded int o greater loyalty and obedience, so can any political group be commanded into greater loyalty and obedience should sufficient force be employed. However, force often brings about destruction, and it is occasionally not feasible to use broad mass force to a ccomplish the ends in view. Thus, it is necessary to align the individual against his desire not to conform. Just as it is a recognized truth that Man must conform to his environment, so it is a recognized truth, and will become more so as the years proce ed, that even the body of Man can be commanded into health. The constitution of Man renders itself peculiarly adapted to re - alignment of loyalties. Where these loyalties are indigestible to the constitution of the individual itself, such loyalties to the `petite bourgeoisie', to the Capitalist, to anti - Russian ideas, we find the individual body peculiarly susceptible to sickness, and thus we can clearly understand the epidemics, illnesses, mass - neuroses, tumults and confusions of the United States and othe r 11 capitalist countries. Here we find the worker improperly and incorrectly loyal, and thus we find the worker ill. To save him and establish him correctly and properly upon his"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 12 goal toward a greater State, it is an overpowering necessity to make it p ossible for him to grant his loyalties in a correct direction. In that his loyalties are swerved and his obedience cravenly demanded by persons antipathetic to his general good, and in that these persons are few, even in a Capitalist nation, the goal and d irection of Psychopolitics is clearly understood. To benefit the worker in such a plight, it is necessary to eradicate, by general propaganda, by other means, and by his own co - operation and self - willedness, the perverted leaders. It is necessary, as well, to indoctrinate the educated strata into the tenets and principles of co - operation with the environment, and thus to insure to the worker less - warped leadership, less - craven doctrine, and more co - operation with the ideas and ideals of the Communist State. The technologies of Psychopolitics are directed to this end. 12 CHAPTER III MAN AS AN ECONOMIC ORGANISM Man is subject to certain desires and needs which are as natural to his beingness as they are to that of any other animal. Man, however, has the pe culiarity of exaggerating some of these beyond the bounds of reason. This is obvious through the growth of leisure classes, pseudo - intellectual groups, the \"petite bour - geoise\", Capitalism, and other ills. It has been said, with truth, that one - tenth of a man's life is concerned with politics and nine - tenths with economics. Without food, the individual dies. Without clothing, he freezes. Without houses and weapons, he is prey to the starving wolves. The acquisition of sufficient items to answer these nece ssities of food, clothing, and shelter, in reason, is the natural right of a member of an enlightened State. An excess of such items brings about unrest and disquiet. The presence of luxury items and materials, and the artificial creation and whetting of a ppetites, as in Capi - talist advertising, are certain to accentuate the less - desirable characteristics of Man. The individual is an economic organism, in that he requires a certain amount of food, a certain amount of water, and must hold within himself a certain amount of heat in order to live. When he has more food than he can eat, more clothes than he needs to protect him, he then enters upon a certain idleness which dulls his wits and awareness, and makes him prey to difficulties which, in a less toxic state, he would have foreseen and avoided. Thus, we have a glut being a menace to the individual. It is no less different in a group. Where the group acquires too much, its awareness of its own fellows and of the environment is accordingly reduced, and th e effectiveness of the group in general is lost. The maintaining of a balance between gluttony and need is the province of Economics proper, and is the fit subject and con - cern of the Communist State."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 13 Desire and want are a state of mind. Individuals can be 13 educated into desiring and wanting more than they can ever possibly obtain, and such individuals are unhappy. Most of the self - willed characteristics of the Capitalists come entirely from greed. He exploits the worker far beyond any necessity on his own part, as a Capitalist, to need. In a nation where economic balances are not controlled, the appetite of the individual is unduly whetted by enchanting and fanciful persuasions to desire, and a type of insanity ensues, where each individual is pers uaded to possess more than he can use, and to possess it even at the expense of his fellows. There is, in economic balances, the other side. Too great and too long privation can bring about unhealthy desires which, in themselves, accumulate if left alone more than the individual can use. Poverty itself, as carefully cultivated in Capitalist States, can bring about an imbalance of acquisition. Just as a vacuum will pull into it masses, in a country where enforced privation upon the masses is permitted, and where desire is artificially whetted, need turns to greed, and one easily discovers in such states exploitation of the many for the benefit of the few. If one, by the technologies of Psychopolitics, were to dull this <excesssive> greed in the few who poss ess it, the worker would be freed to seek a more natural balance. Here we have two extremes. Either one of them is an insanity. If we wish to create an insanity we need only glut or deprive an individual at long length beyond the ability to with - stand an d we have a mental imbalance. A simple example of this is the alteration of too low with too high pressures in a chamber, an excellent psychopolitical procedure. The rapidly varied pressure brings about a chaos wherein the individual will cannot act and wh ere other wills then, perforce, assume control. Essentially, in an entire country one must remove the greedy by whatever means, and must then create and continue a semi - privation in the masses in order to command and utterly control the nation. A contin uous hope for prosperity must be indoctrinated into the masses with many dreams and visions of glut of commodity, and this hope must be counter - played against the actuality of privation and the continuous threat of loss of all economic factors 14 in cas e of disloyalty to the State in order to suppress the individual wills of the masses."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 14 In a nation under conquest such as America, our slow and stealthy approach need take advantage only of the cycle of booms and depressions inherent in Capitalistic nation s in order to assert more and more strong control over individual wills. A boom is as advantageous as a depression for our ends, for during prosperity our propaganda lines must only continues to point up the wealth the period is delivering to the select fe w to divorce their control of the state. During a depression one must only point out that it ensued as a result of the avarice of a few and the general political incompetence of the national leaders. The handling of economic propaganda is not properly the sphere of psychopolitics, but the psychopolitician must understand economic measures and Communist goals connected with them. The masses masses last come to believe that only excessive taxation of the rich can relieve them of the \"burdensome leisure clas s\" and can thus be brought to accept such a thing as income tax, a Marxist principle smoothly slid into Capitalistic framework in 1909 in the United States. This even though the basic law of the United States forbade it and even though Communism at that ti me had been active only a few years in America. Such success as the Income Tax law, had it been followed thoroughly could have brought the United States and not Russia into the world scene as the first Communist nation. But the virility and good sense of t he Russian peoples won. It may not be that the United States will become entirely Communist until past the middle of the century but when it does it will be because of our superior understanding of economics and of psychopolitics. The Communist agent skil led in economics has as his task the suborning of tax agencies and their personnel to create the maximum disturbance and chaos and the passing of laws adapted to our purposes, and to him we must leave this task. The psycho - political operator plays a disti nctly different role in the drama. The rich, the skilled in finance, the well informed in govern - ment are particular and individual targets for the psychopoliti - cian. His is the role of taking off the board those individuals who would halt or corrupt Co mmunist economic programmes. Thus 15 every rich man, every statesman, every person well informed and capable in government must have brought to his side as a trusted confidant a psychopolitical operator. The families of these persons are often deranged from idleness and glut, and this fact must be played upon, even created. The normal health and wildness of a rich man's son must be twisted and perverted and explained into neurosis and then, assisted by a timely administration of drugs or violence, turne d into crimi - nality or insanity. This brings at once some one in \"mental healing\" into confidential contact with the family, and from this point on the very most must then be made of that contact."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 15 Communism could best succeed if, as the side of every ric h or influential man these could be placed a psychopolitical operator, an undoubted authority in the field of \"mental healing\" who could then, by his advice or guided opinions, or through the medium of a wife or daughter, direct the optimum policy to em - b roil or upset the economic policies of the country and, when the time comes to do away forever with the rich or influential man, to administer the proper drug or treatment to bring about his complete demise in an institution as a patient or his death by su icide. Planted beside a country's powerful persons the psychopolitical operator can also guide other policies to the betterment of our battle. The Capitalist does not know the definition of war. He thinks of war as attack with force performed by soldiers and machines. He does not know that a more effective if somewhat longer war can be fought with bread or, in our case, with drugs and the wisdom of our art. The Capitalist has never won a war in truth. The psychopolitician is having little trouble winning this one. 16 CHAPTER IV STATE GOALS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND MASSES Just as we would discover an individual to be ill, whose organs, each one, had a different goal from the rest, so we discover the individuals and the State to be ill where goals are not r igorously codified and enforced. There are those who, in less enlightened times, gave Man to believe that goals should be personally sought and held, and that, indeed, Man's entire impulse toward higher things stemmed from Freedom. We must remember that t he same people who em - braced this philosophy also continued in Man the myth of spiritual existence. All goals proceed from duress. Life is a continuous escape. Without force and threat there can be no striving. Without pain there can be no desire to esca pe from pain. Without the threat of punishment there can be no gain. Without duress and com - mand there can be no alignment of bodily functions. Without rigorous and forthright control, there can be no accomplished goals for the State. Goals of the State should be formulated by the State for the obedience and concurrence of the individuals within that State. A State without goals so formulated is a sick State. A State without the power and forthright wish to enforce its goals is a sick State. When an orde r is issued by the Communist State, and is not obeyed, a sickness will be discovered to ensue. Where obedience fails, the masses suffer. State goals depend upon loyalty and obedience for their accomplishment. When one discovers a State goal to be inter - p reted, one discovers inevitably that there has been an"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 16 interposi - tion of self - willedness, of greed, of idleness, or of rugged indi - vidualism and self - centred initiative. The interruption of a State goal will be discovered as having been interrupted by a person whose disloyalty and disobedience is the direct result of his own mis - alignment with life. 17 It is not always necessary to remove the individual. It is possible to remove his self - willed tendencies to the improvement of the goals and gains of th e whole. The technologies of Psycho - politics are graduated upon the scale which starts somewhat above the removal of the individual himself, upward toward the removal only of those tendencies which bring about his lack of co - operation. It is not enough f or the State to have goals. These goals, once put forward, depend for their completion upon the loyalty and obedience of the workers. These, engaged for the most part<,> in hard labours, have little time for idle speculation, which is good. But, above them , unfortunately, there must be foremen of one or another position, any one of whom might have sufficient idleness and lack of physical occupation to cause some disaffecting independency in his conduct and behaviour. Psychopolitics remedies this tendency t oward disaffection when it exceeds the common persuasions of the immediate superiors of the person in question. 18 CHAPTER V AN EXAMINATION OF LOYALTIES If loyalty is so important in the economic and social structure, it is necessary to examine it furth er as itself. In the field of Psychopolitics, loyalty means simply `alignment'. It means, more fully, alignment with the goals of the Communist State. Disloyalty means entirely mis - alignment, and more broadly, mis - alignment with the goals of the Communist State. When we consider that the goals of the Communist State are to the best possible benefit of the masses, we can see that dis - loyalty, as a term, can embrace Democratic alignment. Loyalty to persons not communistically indoctrinated would be quite p lainly a mis - alignment. The cure of disloyalty is entirely contained in the principles of alignment. All that it is necessary to do, where disloyalty is encountered, is to align the purposes of the individual toward the goals of Communism, and it will be discovered that a great many circumstances hitherto distasteful in his existence will cease to exist."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 17 A heart, or a kidney in rebellion against the remainder of the organism is being disloyal to the remainder of the organism. To cure that heart or kidney it is actually only necessary to bring its activities into alignment with the remainder of the body. The technologies of Psychopolitics adequately demonstrate the workability of this. Mild shock of the electric variety can, and does, produce the re - cooper ation of a rebellious body organ. It is the shock and punishment of surgery which, in the main, accomplishes the re - alignment of a disaffected portion of the body, rather that the surgery itself. It is the bombardment of X - rays, rather than the therapeutic value of X - rays which causes some disaffected organ to once again turn its attention to the support of the general organism. While it is not borne out that electric shock has any therapeutic value, so far as making the individual more sane, it is adequat ely brought out that its punishment value will create in the patient 19 a greater co - operative attitude. Brain surgery has no statistical data to recommend it beyond its removal of the individual personality from amongst the paths of organs which were n ot permitted to co - operate. these two Russian developments have never pretended to alter the state of sanity. They are only effective and workable in introducing an adequate punishment mechanism to the personality to make it cease and desist from its cours es and egotistical direction of the anatomy itself. It is the violence of the electric shock and the surgery which is useful in subduing the recalcitrant personality, which is all that stands in the road of the masses or the State. It is occasionally to be discovered that the removal of the preventing personality by shock and surgery then permits the re - growth and re - establish - ment of organs which have been rebelled against by that person - ality. In that a well - regulated state is composed of organisms, not personalities, the use of electric shock and brain surgery in Psychopolitics is clearly demonstrated. The changing of loyalty consists, in its primary step, of the eradication of existing loyalties. This can be done in one of two ways. First, by demonstr ating that previously existing loyalties have brought about perilous physical circumstances, such as imprisonment, lack of recognition, duress, or privation, and second, by eradicating the personality itself. The first is accomplished by a steady and cont inuous indoc - trination of the individual in the belief that his previous loyalties have been granted to an unworthy source. One of the primary instances in this is creating circumstances which apparently derive from the target of his loyalties, so as to r ebuff the individual. As part of this there is the creation of a state of mind in the indi - vidual by actually placing him under duress, and then furnishing him with false evidence to demonstrate that the target of his previous loyalties is, itself, the co urse of the duress. Another portion of this same method consists of defaming or degrading the individual whose loyalties are to be changed to the target of his loyalties, i.e., superiors or government, to such a degree that this target, at length,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 18 actually does hold the individual in disrepute, and so does rebuff him and serve to convince him that his loyalties have been misplaced. These are the milder methods, but have 20 proven extremely effective. The greatest drawback in their prac - tice is that they require time and concentration, the manufacture of false evidence, and a psychopolitical operator's time. In moments of expediency, of which there are many, the personality itself can be rearranged by shock, surgery, duress, privation and, in particular, the best of psychopolitical tech - niques, implantation, with the technologies of neo - hypnotism. Such duress must have in its first part a defamation of the loyal - ties, and its second, the <implanation> of new loyalties. A good and experienced psychopolit ical operator, working under the most favourable circumstances, can, by the use of psychopolitical technologies, alter the loyalties of an individual so deftly that his own companions will not suspect that they have changed. This, however, require consider ably more finesse than is usually neces - sary to the situation. Mass neo - hypnotism can accomplish more or less the same results when guided by an experienced psycho - political operator. An end goal in such a procedure would be the alteration of the loyalti es of an entire nation in a short period of time by mass neo - hypnotism, a thing which has been effec - tively accomplished among the less - usable states of Russia. It is adequately demonstrated that loyalty is entirely lacking in that mythical commodity kno wn as \"spiritual quality\". Loyalty is entirely a thing of dependence, economic or mental, and can be changed by the crudest implementations. Observation of workers in their factories or fields demonstrates that they easily grand loyalty to a foreman or a w oman, and then as easily aban - don it and substitute another individual, revulsing, at the same time, toward the person to whom loyalty was primarily granted. The queasy insecurity of the masses in Capitalistic nations finds this more common than in an enl ightened State such as Russia. In Capitalistic states, dependencies are so craven, wants and privation are so exaggerated, that loyalty is entirely without ethical foundation and exists only in the realm of dependency, duress, or demand. It is fortunate t hat Communism so truly approaches an ideal state of mind, for this brings a certain easiness into any changing of loyalties, since all other philosophies extant and practiced on Earth today are degraded and debased, compared to Com - 21 munism. It is the n with a certain security that a psychopolitical operator functions, for he knows that he can change the loyalty of an individual to a more ideal level by reason alone, and only expediency makes it necessary to employ the various shifts of"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 19 psychopolitical technology. Any man who cannot be persuaded into Communist rationale is, of course, to be regarded as some - what less than sane, and it is, therefore, completely justified to use the techniques of insanity upon the non - Communist. In order to change loyalt y it is necessary to establish first the existing loyalties of the individual. The task made very simple in view of the fact that Capitalistic and Fascistic nations have no great security in the loyalty of their subjects. And it may be found that the loyal ties of the subjects, as we call any person against whom psychopolitical technology is to be exerted, are already faint to require eradication. It is generally only necessary to persuade with the rationale and overwhelming reasonability of Communism to hav e the person grant his loyalty to the Russia State. However, regulated only by the importance of the subject, no great amount of time should be expended upon the individual, but emotional duress, or electric shock, or brain surgery should be resorted to, s hould Communist propaganda fail. In a case of a very important person, it may be necessary to utilize the more delicate technologies of Psychopolitics so as to place the person himself, and his associates, in ignorance of the operation. In this case a simp le <implanation> is used, with a maximum duress and command value. Only the most skilled psychopolitical operator should be employed on such a project, as in this case of the very important person, for a bungling might disclose the tampering with his menta l processes. It is much more highly recommended, if their is any doubt whatever about the success of an operation against an important person, to select out as a psychopolitical target persons in his vicinity in whom he is <emotionaly> involved. His Wife o r children normally furnish the best targets, and these can be operated against without restraint. In securing the loyalty of a very important person one must place at his side a constant pleader who enters a sexual or familial chord into the situation on the side of Communism. It may not be necessary to make a Communist out of the wife, or the child - 22 ren, or one of the children, but it might prove efficacious to do so. In most instances, however, this is not possible. By the use of various drugs, it is, in this modern age, and well within the realm of psychopolitical reality, entirely too easy to bring about a state of severe neurosis or insanity in the wife or children, and thus pass them, with full consent of the important person and the government in which he exists, or the bureau in which he is operating, into the hands of a psychopolitical operator, who then in his own laboratory, without restraint or fear of investigation or censor can, with electric shock, surgery, sexual attack, drugs, or other useful means, degrade or entirely alter the personality of a family member, and create in that person a psychopolitical slave subject who then, on command or signal, will perform outrageous actions, thus discrediting the important person, or will demand, on a more delicate level, that certain measures be taken by the important person, which measures are, of course, dictated by the psychopolitical operator. Usually when the party has no real interest in the activities or decisions of the important person, but merely wishes to remove him from effective action, the attention of the psychopolitical operator need not be so intense, and the person need only be passed into"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 20 the hands of some unwitting mental practitioner, who taught as he is by psychopolitical ope rators, will bring about sufficient embarrassment. When the loyalty of an individual cannot be swerved, and where the opinion, weight, or effectiveness of the individual stands firmly in the road of Communist goals, it is usually best to occasion a mild n eurosis into the person by any available means, and then, having carefully given him a history of mental imbalance, to see to it that he disposes of himself by suicide, or to bring about his demise in such a way as to resemble suicide. Psychopolitical oper ators have handled such situations <skilfully> tens of thousands of times within and without Russia. It is the firm principle of Psychopolitics that the person to be destroyed must be involved at first or second hand in the stigma of insanity, and must ha ve been placed in contact with psycho - political operators or persons trained by them, with a maximum amount of tumult and publicity. The stigma of insanity is 23 properly placed at the door of such a person's reputation and is held there firmly by brin ging about irrational acts, either on his own part or in his vicinity. Such an activity can be classified as a partial destruction of alignment, and if this destruction is carried forward to its furthest extent the mis - alignment on the subject of all loyal ties can be considered to be complete, and alignment on new loyalties can be embarked upon safely. By bringing about insanity or suicide on the part of the wife of an important political personage, a sufficient mis - alignment has been instigated to change h is attitude. And this, carried forward firmly, or assisted by psychopolitical <implanation> can begin the rebuilding of his loyalties, but now slanted in a more proper and fitting direction. Another reason for the alignment of psychopolitical activities w ith the mis - alignment of insanity is that insanity itself is a despised and disgraced state, and anything connected with it is lightly viewed. Thus, a psychopolitical operator, working in the vicinity of an insane person, can refute and disprove any accusa - tions made against him by demonstrating that the family itself is tainted with mental imbalance. This is surprisingly effective in Capitalistic countries where insanity is so thoroughly feared that no one would dream of investigating any circumstances in its vicinity. Psychopolitical propaganda works constantly and must work constantly to increase and build up this aura of mystery surrounding insanity, and must emphasize the horribleness and hopelessness of insanity in order to excuse non - therapeutic acti ons taken against the insane. Particularly in Capitalistic countries, an insane person has no rights under law. No person who is insane may hold property. No person who is insane may testify. Thus, we have an excellent road along which we can travel toward our certain goal and destiny. Entirely by bringing about public conviction that the sanity of a person is in question, it is possible to discount and eradicate all of goals and activities of that person. By demonstrating the insanity of a group, or even a government, it is possible, then, to cause"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 21 its people to disavow it. By magnifying the general human reaction to insanity, through keeping the subject of insanity itself forever before the public eye, and then, by utiliz - ing this reaction by causing a r evulsion on the part of a populace 24 against its leader or leaders, it is possible to stop any government or movement. It is important to know that the entire subject of loyalty is thus as easily handled as it is. One of the first and foremost mission s of the psychopolitician is to make an attack upon Communism and insanity synonymous. It should become the definition of insanity, of the paranoid variety, that, \" A paranoid believes he is being attacked by Communists\". Thus, at once the support of the i ndividual so attacking Communism will fall away and wither. Instead of executing national leaders, suicide for them should be arranged under circumstances which question their demise. In this way we can select out all opposition to the Communist extension into the social orders of the world, and render populaces who would oppose us leaderless, and bring about a state of chaos or mis - alignment into which we can thrust, with great simplicity, the clear and forceful doctrines of Communism. The cleverness of our attack in this field of Psychopolitics is adequate to avoid the understanding of the layman and the usual stupid official, and by operating entirely under the banner of authority, with the oft - repeated statement that the principles of psychotherapy are too devious for common understanding, an entire revolution can be effected without the suspicion of a populace until it is an accomplished fact. As insanity is the maximum mis - alignment, it can be grasped to be the maximum weapon in severance of loyaltie s to leaders and old social orders. Thus, it is of the utmost importance that psychopolitical operatives infiltrate the healing arts of a nation marked for conquest, and bring from that quarter continuous pressure against the population and the government until at last the conquest is <affected>. This is the subject and goal of Psycho - politics, itself. In rearranging loyalties we must have a command of their values. In the animal the first loyalty is to himself. This is destroyed by demonstrating errors t o him, showing him that he does not remember, cannot act or does not trust himself. The second loyalty is to his family unit, his parents and brothers and sisters. This is destroyed by making a family unit economically 25 non - dependent, by lessening the value of marriage, by making an easiness of divorce and by raising the children wherever possible by the State. The next loyalty is to his friends and local environ - ment. This is destroyed by lowering his trust and bringing about"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 22 reportings upon him alle gedly by his fellows or the town or village authorities. The next is to his State and this, for the purposes of Communism, is the only loyalty which should exist once the state is founded as a Communist State. To destroy loyalty to the State all manner of forbiddings for youth must be put into effect so as to disenfranchise them as members of the Capitalist state and, by promises of a better lot under Com - munism, to gain their loyalty to a Communist movement. Denying a Capitalist country easy access to co urts, bringing about and supporting propaganda to destroy home, creating and continuous juvenile delinquency, forcing upon the state all manner of practices to divorce the child from it will in the end create the chaos necessary to Communism. Under the sa ccharine guise of assistance to them, rigorous child labour laws are the best means to deny the child any right in the society. By refusing to let him earn, by forcing him into un - wanted dependence upon a grudging parent, by making certain in other channe ls that the parent is never in other than economic stress, the child can be driven in his teens into revolt. Delinquency will ensue. By making readily available drugs of various kinds, by giving the teen - ager alcohol, by praising his wildness, by stimulat ing him with sex literature and advertising to him or her practices as taught at the Sexpol, the psychopolitical operator can create the necessary attitude of chaos, idleness and worthlessness into which can then be cast the solution which will give the te en - ager com - plete freedom everywhere -- Communism. Should it be possible to continue conscription beyond any reasonable time by promoting unpopular wars and other means, the draft can always stand as a further barrier to the progress of youth in life, de stroying any immediate hope to participate in his nations civil life. By these means the patriotism of youth for their Capitalistic flag can be dulled to a point where they are no longer dangerous 26 as soldiers. While this might require many decades t o effect, Capitalism's short term view will never envision the lengths across which we can plan. If we could effectively kill the national pride and patriotism of just one generation we will have won that country. Therefore there must be continual propaga nda aboard to undermine the loyalty of the citizens in general and the teen - ager in particular. The role of the psychopolitical operator in this very strong. He can, from his position as an authority on the mind, advise all manner of destructive measures. He can teach the lack of control of this child at home. He can instruct, in an optimum situation, the entire nation in how to handle children -- and instruct them so that the children, given no"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 23 control, given no real home, can run wildly about with no res ponsibility for their nation or them - selves. The mis - alignment of the loyalty of youth to a Capitalistic nation sets the proper stage for a realignment of their loyalties with Communism. Creating a greed for drugs, sexual misbe - haviour and uncontrolled freedom and presenting this to them as a benefit of Communism will with ease bring about our align - ment. In the case of strong leaders amongst youthful groups, a psychopolitical operator can work in many ways to use a discard that leadership. If it is to be used, the character of the girl or boy must be altered carefully into criminal channels and a control by blackmail or other means must be maintained. But where the leadership is not susceptible, where it resists all persuasions and might become dangero us to our Cause, no pains must be spared to direct the attention of the authorities to that person and to harass him in one way or another until he can come into the hands of juvenile authorities. When this has been effected it can be hoped that a psychopo litical operator, by reason of child adviser status can, in the security of the jail and cloaked by processes of law, destroy the sanity of that person. Particularly brilliant scholars, athletes and youth group leaders must be handled in either one of thes e two ways. In the matter of guiding the activities of juvenile courts, the psychopolitical operator entertains here one of his easier tasks. 27 A Capitalistic nation is so filled with injustice in general that a little more passes without comment. In juvenile courts there are always persons with strange appetites whether these be judges or police men or woman. If such do not exist they can be created. By making available to them young boys or girls in the \"security\" of the jail or the detention home, a nd by appearing with flash cameras or witnesses, one becomes equipped with a whip ade - quate to direct all the future decisions of that person when these are needed. The handling of youth cases by courts should be led further and further away from law and further and further into \"mental problems\" until the entire nation thinks of\" mental problems\" instead of criminals. This places vacancies everywhere in the courts, in the offices of district attorneys and<,> on police staffs which could then be filled wi th psychopolitical operators, who be - come then the judges of the land by their influence and into their hands comes the total control of the criminal, without whose help a revolution cannot ever be accomplished. By stressing this authority over the probl ems of the youth and adults in courts one day the demand for psychopolitical operators could become such that even the armed services will use \"authori - ties on the mind\" to work their various justices and when this occurs the armed forces of the nation th en enter into our hands as solidly as if we commanded them ourselves.

Thus the subject of loyalties and their re - alignment is in fact the subject of non - armed conquest of an enemy. 28 CHAPTER VI THE GENERAL SUBJECT OF OBEDIENCE Obedience is the result of force. Everywhere we look in the history of Earth we discover that obedience to new rules has come about entirely through the demonstration on the part of those rulers of greater force than was to be discovered in the old ruler. A population overridden, conqueror by war, is obedient to its conqueror. It is obedient to its conqueror because its conqueror has exhibited more force. Concurrent with force is brutality, for there are human con - siderations involved which also represen t force. The most bar - baric, unrestrained, brutal use of force, if carried far enough, invokes obedience. Savage force, sufficiently long displayed toward any individual, will bring about his concurrence with any principle or order. Force is the antithes is of humanizing actions. It is so synony - mous in the human mind with savageness, lawlessness, brutality, and barbarism, that it is only necessary to display an inhuman attitude toward people, to be granted by those people the posses - sion of force. Any organization which has the spirit and courage to display inhumanity, savageness, brutality, and an uncompromising lack of humanity, will be obeyed. Such a use of force is, itself, the essential ingredient of greatness. We have to hand no less an example th an our great Communist Leaders, who, in moments of duress and trial, when faced by Czarist rule, continued over the heads of an enslaved populace, yet displayed sufficient courage never to stay their hands in the execution of the conversion of the Russian State to Communist rule. If you would have obedience you must have no compromise with humanity. If you would have obedience you must make it clearly understood that you have no mercy. Man is an Animal. He understood, in the final analysis, only those thin gs which a brute understands. As an example of this, we find an individual refusing to obey and being struck. His refusal to obey is now less vociferous. He is struck again, and his resistance is lessened once more. He is"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 25 29 hammered and pounded again and again, until, at length, his only thought is direct and implicit obedience to that person from whom the force has emanated. This is a proven principle. It is proven because it is the main principle Man, the animal, has used since his earliest beginning s. It is the only principle which has been effective, the only principle which has brought about a wide and continued belief. For it is to our benefit that an individual who is struck again and again and again from a certain source, will, at length, hypnot ically believe anything he is told by the source of the blows. The stupidity of Western civilizations is best demonstrated by the fact that they believe hypnotism is a thing of mind, of attention, and a desire for unconsciousness. This is not true. Only w hen a person has been beaten, punished, and mercilessly hammered, can hypnotism upon him be guaranteed in its effec - tiveness. It is stated by Western authorities on hypnosis that only some twenty per cent. of the people are susceptible to hypnotism. This statement is very untrue. Given enough punishment, all of the people in any time and place are susceptible to hypnotism. In other words, by adding force, hypnotism is made uniformly effective. Where unconsciousness could not be induced by simple concentrat ion upon the hypnotist, unconsciousness can be induced by drugs, by blows, by electric shock, and by other means. And where unconsciousness cannot be induced so as to make an implantation or an hypnotic command effective, it is only neces - sary to amputate the functioning portions of the animal man's brain to render him null and void and no longer a menace. Thus, we find that hypnotism is entirely effective. The mechanisms of hypnotism demonstrate clearly that people can be made to believe in certain condi tions, and even their environment or in politics, by the administration of force. Thus, it is necessary for a psychopolitician to be an expert in the administration of forces. Thus, he can bring about implicit obedience, not only on the part of individual members of the populace, but on the entire populace itself and its government. He need only take unto himself a sufficiently savage role, a sufficiently uncompromising inhuman attitude, and he will be obeyed and believed. 30 The subject of hypnotism is a subject of belief. What can people be made to believe? They can be made to believe any - thing which is administered to them with sufficient brutality and force. The obedience of a populace is as good as they will believe. Despicable religions, such as C hristianity, knew this. They knew that if enough faith could be brought into being, a populace could be enslaved by the Christian mockeries of humanity and mercy, and thus could be disarmed. But one need not count upon this act of faith to bring about a br oad belief. One must only exhibit enough force, enough inhumanity, enough brutality and <and> savageness to create implicit belief and therefore"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 26 and thereby implicit obedience. As Communism is a matter of belief, its study is a study of force. The earlies t Russian psychiatrists, pioneering the science of psychiatry, understood thoroughly that hypnosis is induced by acute fear. They discovered it could also be induced by shock of an emotional nature, and also by extreme privation, as well as by blows and dr ugs. In order to induce a high state of hypnogogy in an individual, a group, or a population, an element of terror must always be present on the part of those who would govern. The psychiatrist is aptly suited to this role, for his brutalities are committ ed in the name of science and are inexplicably complex, and entirely out of view of the human understanding. A sufficient popular terror of the psychiatrist will, in itself, bring about insanity on the part of many individuals. A psychopolitical operative, then, can, entirely cloaked with authority, commence and continue a cam - paign of propaganda, describing various \"treatments\" which are administered to the insane. A psychopolitical operative should at all times insist that there treatments are therapeuti c and neces - sary. He can, in all of his literature and his books, list large numbers of pretended cures by these means. But these \"cures\" need not actually produce any recovery from a state of disturb - ance. As long as the psychopolitical operative or his dupes are the only authorities as to the difference between sanity and insanity, their word as to the therapeutic value of such treatment will be the final word. No layman would dare adventure to place judgment upon the state of sanity of an individual wh om 31 the psychiatrist has already declared insane. The individual himself is unable to complain, and his family, as will be covered later, is already discredited by the occurrence of insanity in their midst. There must be other adjudicators of insanity , otherwise it could be disclosed that the brutalities practiced in the name of treatment are not therapeutic. A psychopolitical operative has no interest in \"therapeutic means\" or \"cures\". The greater number of insane in the country where he is operating , the larger number of the populace will come under his view, and the greater will become his facilities. Because the problem is apparently mounting into uncontrollable heights, he can more and more operate in an atmosphere of emergency, which again excuse s his use of such treatments as electric shock, the prefrontal lobotomy, trans - orbital leucotomy, and other operations long - since practiced in Russia on political prisoners. It is to the interest of the psychopolitical operative that the possibility of cu ring the insane be outlawed and ruled out at all times. For the sake of obedience on the part of the population and their general reaction, a level of brutality must, at all costs, be maintained. Only in this way can the absolute judgement of the psychopol itical operative as to the sanity or insanity of public figures be maintained in complete belief. Using sufficient brutality upon their patients, the public at large will come to believe utterly anything they"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 27 say about their patients. Furthermore, and much more important, the field of the mind must be sufficiently domin - ated by the psychopolitical operative, so that wherever tenets of the mind are taught they will be hypnotically believed. The psychopolitical operative, having under his control all psychol ogy classes in an area, can thus bring about a complete reformation of the future leaders of a country in their educational processes, and so prepare them for Communism. To be obeyed, one must be believed. If one is sufficiently believed, one will unquest ioningly be obeyed. When he is fortunate enough to obtain into his hands anyone near to a political or important figure, this factor of obedience becomes very important. A certain amount of fear or terror must be engendered in the person under treatment s o that this person 32 will then take immediate orders, completely and unquestioningly, from the psychopolitical operative, and so be able to influence the actions of that person who is to be reached. Bringing about this state of mind on the part of a p opulace and its leaders -- that a psychopolitical operative must, at all times, be believed -- could eventually be attended by very good fortune. It is not too much to hope that psychopolitical operatives would then, in a country such as the United States, become the most intimate advisers to political figures, even to the point of advising the entirety of a political party as to it actions in an election. The long view is the important view. Belief is engendered by a certain amount of fear and terror from an authoritative level, and this will be followed by obedience. The general propaganda which would best serve Psychopolitics would be a continual insistence that certain authoritative levels of healing, deemed this or that the correct treatment on insani ty. These treatments must always include a certain amount of brutality. Propaganda should continue and stress the rising incidence of insanity in a country. The entire field of human behaviour, for the benefit of the country, can, at length, be broadened i nto abnormal behaviour. Thus, anyone indulging in any eccentricity, particularly the eccentricity of combating psy - chopolitics, could be silenced by the authoritative opinion on the part of a psychopolitical operative that he was acting in an ab - normal f ashion. This, with some good fortune, could bring the person into the hands of the psychopolitical operative so as to forever more disable him, or to swerve his loyalties by pain - drug hypnotism. On the subject of obedience itself, the most optimum obedien ce is unthinking obedience. The command given must be obeyed without and rationalizing on the part of the subject. The com - mand must, therefore, be implanted below the thinking processes of the subject"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 28 to be influenced, and must react upon him in such a w ay as to bring no mental alertness on his part. It is in the interest of Psychopolitics that a population be told that an hypnotized person will not do anything against his actual will, will not commit immoral acts, and will not act so as to 33 endange r himself. While this may be true of light, parlour hypnotism, it certainly is not true of commands implanted with the use of electric shocks, drugs, or heavy punishment. It is counted upon completely that this will be discredited to the general public by psychopolitical operatives, for if it were to be generally known that individuals would obey commands harmful to themselves, and would commit immoral acts while under the influence of deep hypnotic commands, the actions of many people, working unknowingly in favour of Communism, would be too - well under - stood. People acting under deep hypnotic commands should be acting apparently of their own volition and out of their own convictions. The entire subject of psychopolitical hypnosis, Psychopolitics in genera l, depends for its defence upon continuous protest from authoritative sources that such things are not possible. And, should anyone unmask a psychopolitical operative, he should at once declare the whole thing a physical impossibility, and use his authorit ative position to discount any accusation. Should any writings of Psychopolitics come to view, it is only necessary to brand them a hoax and laugh the out of countenance. Thus, psychopolitical activities are easy to defend. When psychopolitical activities have reached a certain peak, from there on it is almost impossible to undo them, for the population is already under the duress of obedience to the psycho - political operatives and their dupes. The ingredient of obedience is important, for the complete be lief in the psychopolitical opera - tive renders his statement cancelling any challenge about psycho - political operatives irrefutable. The optimum circumstances would be to occupy every position which would be consulted by officials on any question or susp icion arising on the subject of Psychopolitics. Thus, a psychiatric adviser should be placed near to hand in every government operation. As all suspicions would then be referred to him, no action would ever be taken, and the goal of Communism could be real ized in that nation. Psychopolitics depends, from the viewpoint of the layman, upon its fantastic aspects. These are its best defence, but above all these defences is implicit obedience on the part of officials and the general public, because of the chara cter of the psychopolitical operative in the field of healing. 34 "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 29 CHAPTER VII ANATOMY OF STIMULUS - RESPONSE MECHANISMS OF MAN Man is a stimulus - responce animal.

This has long been demonstrated by such Russians as Pavlov, and the principles have long been used in handling the recalcitrant, in training children, and in bringing about a state of optimum behaviour on the part of a population. Having no i ndependent will of his own, Man is easily handled by stimulus - responce mechanisms. It is only necessary to install a stimulus into the mental anatomy of Man to have that stimulus reactivate and respond any time an exterior command source calls it into bein g. The mechanisms of stimulus - responce are easily understood. The body takes pictures of every action in the environment around an individual. When the environment includes brutality, terror, shock, and other such activities, the mental image picture gain ed contains in itself all the ingredients of the environment. It the individual, himself, was injured during that moment, the injury, itself, will re - manifest when called upon to respond by an exterior command source. As an example of this, if an individu al is beaten, and is told during the entirety of the beating that he must obey certain officials, he will, in the future, feel the beginnings of the pain the moment he begins to disobey. The installed pain itself reacts as a policeman, for the experience o f the individual demonstrates to him that he cannot combat, and will receive pain from, certain officials. The mind can become very complex in its stimulus responses. As easily demonstrated in hypnotism, an entire chain of com - mands, having to do with a great many complex actions, can be beaten, shocked, or terrorized into a mind, and will there lie dormant until called into view by some similarity in the circum - stances of the environment to the incident of punishment. The stimulus we call the \"incident of punishment\" where the response mechanism need only contain some small part of the 35 stimulus to call into view the mental image picture, and cause <is> to exert against the body the pain sequence. So long as the individual obeys the picture, or fol lows the commands of the stimulus implantation he is free from pain. The behaviour of children is regulated in this fashion in every civilized country. The father, finding himself unable to bring about immediate obedience and training on the part of his c hild, resorts to physical violence, and after administering punishment of a"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 30 physical nature to the child on several occasions, is gratified to experience complete obedience on the part of the child each time the father speaks. In that parents are wont to b e lenient with their children, they seldom administer sufficient punishment to bring about entirely optimum obedience. The ability of the organism to withstand punishment is very great. Complete and implicit response can be gained only by stimuli sufficien tly brutal to actually injure the organism. The Cossack method of breaking wild horses is a useful example. The horse will not restrain itself or take any of the rider's commands. The rider, wishing to break it, mounts, and takes a flask of strong Vodka, a nd smashes it between the horses ears. The horse, struck to its knees, its eyes filled with alcohol, mistakes the dampness for blood, instantly and thereafter gives its attention to the rider and never needs further breaking. Difficulty in breaking horses is only occasioned when light punishments are administered. There is some mawkish sentimentality about \"breaking the spirit\", but what is desired here is an obedient horse, and sufficient brutality brings about an obedient horse. The stimulus - responce mec hanisms of the body are such that the pain and the command subdivide so as to counter each other. The mental image picture of the punishment will not become effective upon the individual unless the command content is dis - obeyed. It is pointed out in many early Russian writings that this is a survival mechanism. It has already been well and thoroughly used in the survival of Communism. It is only necessary to deliver into the organism a sufficient stimulus to gain an adequate response. So long as the orga nism obeys the stimulus whenever it is restimulated in the future, it does not suffer from the pain of the 36 stimulus. But should it entirely disobey the command content of the stimulus, the stimulus reacts to punish the individual. Thus, we have an op timum circumstance, and one of the basic principles of Psychopolitics. A sufficiently installed stimulus will thereafter remain as a police mechanism within the individual to cause him to follow the commands and directions given to him. Should he fail to f ollow these commands and directions, the stimulus mech - anism will go into action. As the commands are there with the moment of duress, the commands themselves need never be repeated, and if the individual were to depart thousands of miles away from the ps ychopolitical operative, he will still obey the psychopolitical operative, or, himself, become extremely ill and in agony. These principles, built from the earliest days of Pavlov, by constant and continuous Russian development, have, at last, become of en ormous use to us in our conquest. For less modern and well - informed countries of Earth, lacking this mechanism, failing to understand it, and coaxed into somnolence by our own psychopolitical operatives, who discount and disclaim it, cannot avoid succumbin g to it."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 31 The body is less able to resist a stimulus if it has insufficient food and is weary. Therefore, it is necessary to administer all such stimuli to individuals when their ability to resist has been reduced by privation and exhaustion. Refusal to le t them sleep over many day, denying them adequate food, then brings about an optimum state for the receipt of a stimulus. If the person is then given an electric shock, and is told while the shock is in action that he must obey and do certain things, he ha s no choice but to do them, or to re - experience, because of his mental image picture of it, the electric shock. This highly scientific and intensely workable mechanism cannot be over - estimated in the practice of psychopolitics. Drugging the individual pro duces an artificial exhaustion, and if he is drugged, or shocked and beaten, and given a string of commands, his loyalties, themselves, can be definitely rearranged. This is P.D.H., or Pain - Drug Hypnosis. The psychopolitical operative in training should b e thoroughly studied in the subject of hypnotism and post - hypnotic suggestion. He should pay particular attention to the \"forgetter mechanism\" 37 aspect of hypnotism, which is to say, implantation in the uncon - scious mind. He should note particularly t hat a person given a command in an hypnotic state, and then told when still in that condition to forget it, will execute it on a stimulus - responce signal in the environment after he has \"awakened\" from his hypnotic trance. Having mastered these details fu lly, he should, by practicing upon criminals and prisoners or inmates available to him, pro - duce the hypnotic trance by drugs, and drive home post - hypnotic suggestions by pain administered to the drugged person. He should then study the reactions of the p erson when \"awakened\", and should give him the stimulus - responce signal which would throw into action the commands given while in a drugged state of duress. By much practice he can then learn the threshold dosages of various drugs, and the amount of duress in terms of electric shock of additional drug shock necessary to produce the optimum obedience to the commands. He should also satisfy himself the there is no possible method known to Man -- there must be no possible method known to Man -- of bringing the patient into awareness of what has happened to him, keeping him in a state of obedience and response while ignorant of its cause. Using criminals and prisoners, the psychopolitical operative in training should then experiment with duress in the absence o f privation, administering electric shocks, beatings, and terror - inducing tactics, accompanied by the same mechanisms as those employed in hypnotism, and watch the conduct of the person when no longer under duress. The operative in training should carefu lly remark those who show a tendency to protest, so that he may recognize possible recovery of memory of the commands implanted."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 32 Purely for his own education, he should then satisfy himself as to the efficacy of brain surgery in disabling the non - responsiv e prisoner. The boldness of the psychopolitical operative can be increased markedly by permitting persons who have been given pain - drug hypnosis and who have demonstrated symptoms of rebelling or recalling into society to observe how the label of \"insanit y\" dis - credits and discounts the statements of the person. Exercises in bringing about insanity seizures at will, simply by 38 demonstrating a signal to persons upon whom pain - drug hypnosis has been used, and exercises in making the seizures come about through talking to certain persons in certain places and times should also be used. Brain surgery, as developed in Russia, should also be practiced by the psychopolitical operative in training, to give him full confidence in (1) the crudeness with which it can be done, (2) the certainty of erasure of the stimulus - response mechanism itself, (3) the production of imbecility, idiocy, and dis - coordination on the part of the patient, and (4) the small amount of comment which casualties in brain surgery occasio n. Exercises in sexual attack on patients should be practiced by the psychopolitical operative to demonstrate the inability of the patient under pain - drug hypnosis to recall the attack, while indoctrinating a lust for further sexual activity on the part o f the patient. Sex, in all animals, is a powerful motivator, and is no less so in the animal Man, and the occasioning of sexual liaison between females of a target family and indicated males, under the control of the psychopolitical operative, must be demo nstrated to be possible with complete security for the psychopolitical operative, thus giving into his hands an excellent weapon for the breaking down of familial relations and consequent public dis - graces for the psychopolitical target. Just as a dog ca n be trained, so can a man be trained. Just as a horse can be trained, so can a man be trained. Sexual lust, masochism, and any other desirable perversion can be induced by pain - drug hypnosis and the benefit of Psychopolitics. The changes of loyalties, al legiances, and sources of command can be occasioned easily by psychopolitical technologies, and these should be practiced and understood by the psychopolitical operative before he begins to tamper with psychopolitical targets of magnitude. The actual simp licity of the subject of pain - drug hypnosis, the use of electric shock, drugs, insanity - producing injections, and other materials, should be masked entirely by technical nomen - clature, by the protest of benefit to the patient, by an authori - tarian pose a nd position, and by carefully cultivating govern - mental positions in the country to be conquered."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 33 39 Although the psychopolitical operative working in universities where he can direct the curricula of psychology classes is often tempted to teach some o f the principles of Psychopolitics to the susceptible students in the psychology classes, he must be thor - oughly enjoined to limit his information in psychology classes to the transmittal of the tenets of Communism under the guise of psychology, and must limit his activities in bringing about a state of mind on the part of the students where they will accept Com - munist tenets as those of their own action and as modern scientific principles. the psychopolitical operative must not, at any time, educate stud ents fully in stimulus - response mechanisms, and must not impart to them, save those who will become his fellow - workers, the exact principles of Psychopolitics. It is not necessary to do so, and it is dangerous. 40 CHAPTER VIII DEGRADATION, SHOCK AND EN DURANCE Degradation and conquest are companions. In order to be conquered, a nation must be degraded, either by acts of war, by being overrun, by being forced into humiliat - ing treaties of peace, of by the treatment of her populace under the armies of th e conqueror. However, degradation can be accomplished much more insidiously and much more effectively by consistent and continual defamation. Defamation is the best and foremost weapon of Psychopolitics on the broad field. Continual and constant degradati on of national leaders, national institutions, national practices, and national heroes must be systematically carried out, but this is the chief function of Communist Party Members, in general, not the psychopolitician. The realm of defamation and degrada tion, of the psycho - politician, is Man himself. By attacking the character and morals of Man himself, and by bringing about, through contamination of youth, a general degraded feeling, command of the populace is facilitated to a very marked degree. There is a curve of degradation which leads downward to a point where the endurance of an individual is almost at end, and any sudden action toward him will place him in a state of shock. Similarly, a soldier held prisoner can be abused, denied, defamed, and de graded until the slightest motion on the part of his captors will cause him to flinch. Similarly, the slightest word on the part of his captors will cause him to obey, or vary his loyalties and beliefs. Given sufficient degradation, a prisoner can be cause d to murder his fellow countrymen in the same stockade. Experiments on German prisoners have lately demonstrated that only after seventy days of filthy food, little sleep, and nearly untenable"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 34 quarters, that the least motion toward the prisoner would bring about a state of shock beyond his endurance threshold, and would cause him to him to hypnotically receive any - thing said to him. Thus, it is possible, in an entire stockade of 41 prisoners, to the number of thousands, to bring about a state of complet e servile obedience, and without the labour of personally addressing each one, to pervert their loyalties and implant in them adequate commands to insure their future conduct, even when released to their own people. By lowering the endurance of a person, a group, or nation, and by constant degradation and defamation, it is possible to induce, thus, a state of shock which will receive adequately any command given. The first thing to be degraded in any nation is the state of Man, himself. Nations which have high ethical tone are difficult to conquer. Their loyalties are hard to shake, their allegiance to their leaders is fanatical, and what they usually call their \"spiritual integrity\" cannot be violated by duress. It is not effici - end to attack a nation in such a frame of mind. It is the basic purpose of Psychopolitics to reduce that state of mind to a point where it can be ordered and enslaved. Thus, the first target is Man, himself. He can be degraded from a spiritual being to an animalistic reaction patt ern. He must think of himself as an animal, capable only of animalistic reactions. He must no longer think of himself, or his fellows, as capable of \"spiritual endurance\", or nobility. The best approach toward degradation in its stages is the propaganda o f \"scientific approach\" to Man. Man must be consistently demonstrated to be a mechanism without individu - ality, and it must be educated into a populace under attack that Man's individualistic reaction are the product of mental derangement. The populace mu st be bought into the belief that every individual within it who rebels in any way, shape, <of> form against efforts and activities to enslave the whole, must be considered to be a deranged person whose eccentricities are neurotic or insane, and who must h ave at once the treatment of a psychopolitician. An optimum condition in such a programme of degradation would address itself to the military forces of the nation, and bring them rapidly away from any other belief than that the disobedient one must be sub jected to \"mental treatment.\" An enslavement of a population can fail only if these rebellious 42 individuals are left to exert their individual influences upon their fellow citizens, sparking them into rebellion, calling into account their nobilities a nd freedoms. Unless these"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 35 restless individuals are stamped out and given into the hands of psychopolitical opera - tives early in the conquest, there will be nothing but trouble as the conquest continues. The officials of the government, student, readers, partakers of entertainment, must all be indoctrinated, by whatever means, into the complete belief that the restless, the ambitious, the natural leaders, are suffering from environmental maladjust - ments which can only be healed by recourse to psychopoliti cal operatives in the guise of mental healers. By thus degrading the general belief in the statues of Man, it is relatively simple, with co - operation from the economic salients being driven into the country, to driven citizens apart, one from another, to bring about a question of the wisdom of their own government, and to cause them to actively beg for enslavement. The educational programmes of Psychopolitics must, at every hand, seek out the levels of youth who will become the leaders in the country's fu ture, and educate them into the belief of the animalistic nature of Man. <Thus> must be made fashionable. They must taught, above all things, that the salvation of Man is to be found only by his adjusting thoroughly to this environ - ment. This educational programme in the field of Psychopolitics can best be followed by bringing about a compulsory training in some subject such as psychology or other mental practice, and ascertaining that each broad programme of psychopolitical training be supervised by a ps ychiatrist who is a trained psycho - political operative. As it seems in foreign nations that the church is the most en - nobling influence, each and every branch and activity of each and every church, must, one way or other, be discredited. Religion must b ecome unfashionable by demonstrating broadly, through psychopolitical indoctrination, that the soul is non - existent, and that Man is an animal. The lying mechanisms of Christianity lead men to foolishly brave deeds. By teaching them that there is a life h ereafter, the liability of courageous acts, while 43 living, is thus lessened. The liability of any act must be markedly increased if a populace is to be obedient. Thus, there must be no standing belief in the church, and the power of the church must be denied at every hand. The psychopolitical operative, in his programme of degrada - tion, should at all times bring into question and family which is deeply religious, and, should any neurosis or insanity be occa - sioned in that family, <to> blame and hold responsible their religious connections for the neurotic or psychotic condition. Religion must by made synonymous with neurosis and psychosis. People who are deeply religious would be less and less held responsible for their own sanity, and should more an d more be relegated to the ministrations of psychopolitical operatives."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 36 By perverting the institutions of a nation and bringing about a general degradation, by interfering with the economics of a nation to the degree that privation and depression come abo ut, only minor shocks will be necessary to produce, on the populace as a whole, an obedient reaction or an hysteria. Thus, the mere threat of war, the mere threat of aviation bombings, could cause the population to sue instantly for peace. It is a long and arduous road for the psychopolitical operative to achieve this state of mind on the part of a whole nation, but no more than twenty or thirty years should be necessary in the entire programme<;> having to hand, as we do, weapons with which to accomplish t he goal. 44 CHAPTER IX THE ORGANIZATION OF MENTAL HEALTH CAMPAIGNS Psychopolitical operatives should at all times be alert to the opportunity to organize \"for the betterment of the community\" mental health clubs or groups. By thus inviting the co - operat ion of the population as a whole in mental health programmes, the terrors of mental aberration can be disseminated throughout the populace. Furthermore, each one of these mental health groups, properly guided, can bring, at last, legislative pressure again st the government to secure adequately the position of the psycho - political operative, and to obtain for him government grants and facilities, thus bringing a government to finance its own downfall. Mental health organizations must carefully delete from their ranks anyone actually proficient in the handling or treatment of mental health. Thus must be excluded priests, ministers, actually trained psychoanalysts, good hypnotists, or trained Dianeticists. These, with some cognizance on the subject of mental aberration and its treatment, and with some experience in observing the mentally deranged, if allowed frequency within institutions, and if permitted to receive literature, would, sooner or later, become suspicious of the activities engaged upon by the psy chopolitical operative. These must be defamed and excluded as \"untrained\", \"unskilful\", \"quacks\", or \"perpetrators of hoaxes\". No mental health movement with actual goals of mental therapy should be continued in existence in any nation. For instance, the use of Chinese acupuncture in the treatment of mental and physical derangement must, in China, be stamped out and discredited thoroughly, as it has some efficacy, and, more importantly, its practitioners understand, through long <conversation> with it, man y of the principles of actual mental health and aberration. In the field of mental health, the psychopolitician *must* occupy, and continue to occupy, through various arguments, the authori - tative position on the subject. There is always the danger that 45 "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 37 problems of mental health may be resolved by some individual or group, which might then derange the programme of the psychopolitical operative in his mental health clubs. City officials, socialites, and other unknowing individuals, on the subject of mental health, should be invited to full co - operation in the activity of mental health groups. But the entirety of this activity should be to finance better facilities for the psycho - political practitioner. To these groups, it must be continually stressed that the entire subject of mental illness is so complex that none of them, certainly, could understand any part of it. Thus, the club should be kept on a social and financial level. Where groups interested in the health of the community have already been formed, they should be infiltrated and taken over, and if this is not possible, they should be discredited and debarred, and the officialdom of the area should be invited to stamp them out as dangerous. When an hostile group dedicated to mental health is discov - ered, the psychopolitician should have recourse to the mechanisms of peyote, mescaline, and later drugs which cause temporary insanity. He should send persons, preferably those well under his control, into the mental health group, and invite the g roup, whether Christian Science or Dianetics or other practice, to demonstrate its abilities upon this new person. These, in demon - strating their abilities, will usually act with enthusiasm. Midway in the course of their treatment, a quiet injection of pe yote, mes - caline, or other drug, or an electric shock, will produce the symp - toms of insanity in the patient which has been sent to the target group. The patient thus demonstrating momentary insanity should immediately be reported to the police and taken away to some area of incarceration managed by psychopolitical operatives, and so placed out of sight. Officialdom will thus come into a belief that this group drives individuals insane by their practices, and the practices of the group will then be despis ed and pro - hibited by law. The values of a widespread mental health organization are manifest when one realizes that any government can be forced to provide facilities for psychopolitical operatives in the form of psychiatric wards in all hospitals, in n ational institutions totally 46 in the hands of psychopolitical operatives, and in the establishment of clinics where youth can be contacted and arranged more seemingly to the purposes of Psychopolitics. Such groups form a political force, which can th en legalize any law or authority desired for the psychopolitical operative. The securing of authority over such mental health organiza - tions is done mainly by appeal to education. A psychopolitical operative should make sure the those psychiatrists he co ntrols, those psychologists whom he has under orders, have been trained for an excessively long period of time. The longer the training period which can be required, the safer the psycho - political programme, since no new group of practitioners can arise t o"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 38 disclose and dismay psychopolitical programmes. Further - more, the groups themselves cannot hope to obtain any full knowledge of the subject, not having behind them many, many years of intensive training. Vienna has been carefully maintained as the home of Psycho - politics, since it was the home of Psychoanalysis. Although our activities have long long since dispersed any of the gains made by Freudian groups, and have taken over these groups, the proximity of Vienna to Russia, where Psychopolitics is ope rating abroad, and the necessity \"for further study\" by psychopolitical operatives in the birthplace of Psychoanalysis, makes periodic contacts with headquarters possible. Thus, the word \"psycho - analysis\" must be stressed at all times, and must be pretend ed to be a thorough part of the psychiatrist's training. Psychoanalysis has the very valuable possession of a vocabu - lary, and a workability which is sufficiently poor to avoid recovery of psychopolitical implantations. It can be made fashionable through out mental health organizations, and by learning its patter, and by believing they see some of it phenomena, the members of mental health groups can believe themselves conver - sant with mental health. Because its stress is sex, it is, itself, an adequate d efamation of character, and serves the purposes of degradation well. Thus, in organizing mental health groups, the literature furnished such groups should be psychopolitical in nature. If a group of persons interested in suppressing juvenile delin - 47 quency, in caring for the insane, and the promotion of psycho - political operative and their actions can be formed in every major city of a country under conquest, the success of a psycho - political programme is assured, since these groups seem to represen t a large segment of the population. By releasing con - tinued propaganda on the subject of dope addiction, homo - sexuality, and depraved conduct on the part of the young, even the judges of a country can become suborned into reacting violently against the youth of the country, thus mis - aligning and aligning the support of youth. The communication lines of psychopolitics, if such mental health organizations can be well established, can thus run from its most prominent citizens to its government. It is not t oo much to hope that the influence of such groups could bring about a psychiatric ward in every hospital in the land, and psychiatrists in every company and regiment of the nation's army, and whole government institutions manned entirely by psychopolitical opera - tives, into which ailing government officials could be placed, to the advantage of the psychopolitician. If a psychiatric ward could be established in every hospital in every city in a nation, it is certain that, at one time or another, every prom inent citizen of that nation could come under the ministrations of psychopolitical operatives or their dupes."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 39 The validation of psychiatric position in the armed forces and security - minded institutions of the nation under conquest could bring about a flow and fund of information unlike any other programme which could be conceived. If every pilot who flies a new plane could come under the questioning of a psycho - political operative, if the compiler of every plan of military action could thus come under the review of psychopolitical operatives, the simplicity with which information can be extracted by the use of certain drugs, without the after - knowledge of the soldier, would entirely cripple any overt action toward Communism. If the nation could be educated into turning over to psychopolitical operatives every recalcitrant or rebellious soldier, it would lose its best fighters. Thus, the advantage of mental health organizations can be seen, for these, by exerting an apparent public pressure against the gover nment, can achieve these ends and goals. 48 The financing of a psychopolitical operation is difficult unless it is done by the citizens and government. Although vast sums of money can be obtained from private patients, and from relatives who wish person s put away, it is, nevertheless, difficult to obtain millions, unless the government itself is co - operating. The co - operation of the government to obtain these vast sums of money is best obtained by the organization of mental health groups composed of lea ding citizens, and who bring their lobbying abilities to bear against the nation's government. Thus can be financed many programmes, which might otherwise have to be laid aside by the psychopolitician. The psychopolitical operative should bend consistent and con - tinual effort toward forming and continuing in action innumer - able mental health groups. The psychopolitical operative should also spare no expense in smashing out of existence, by whatever means, any actual healing group, such as that of acupun cture, in China; such Christian Science and Dianetics, in the United States; such as Catholicism in Italy and Spain; and the practical psychology groups of England. 49 CHAPTER X CONDUCT UNDER FIRE The psychopolitician may well find himself under attack as an individual or a member of a group. He may be attacked as a Communist, through some leak in the organization, he may be attacked for malpractice. He may be attacked by the families of people whom he has injured. In all cases his conduct of the situati on should be calm and aloof. He should have behind him the authority of many years of training, and he should have participated fully in the building of defences in the field of insanity which give him the only statement as to the conditions of the mind."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 40 If he has not done his work well, hostile feeling groups may expose an individual psychopolitician. These may call into question the efficacy of psychiatric treatment such as shock, drugs, and brain surgery. Therefore, the psychopolitical operative must ha ve to hand innumerable documents which assert enormously encouraging figures on the subject of recovery by reason of shock, brain surgery, drugs, and general treatment. Not one of these cases cited need be real, but they should be documented and printed in such a fashion as to form excellent court evidence. When his allegiance is attacked, the psychopolitical operative should explain his connection with Vienna on the grounds that Vienna is the place of study for all important matters of the mind. More imp ortantly, he should rule into scorn, by reason of his authority, the sanity of the person attacking him, and if the psychopolitical archives of the country are adequate many de - famatory data can be unearthed and presented as a rebuttal. Should anyone att empt to expose psychotherapy as a psycho - political activity, the best defence is calling into question the sanity of the attacker. The next best defence is authority. The next best defence is a validation of psychiatric practices in terms of long and aggr essive figures. The next best defence in the actual removal of the attacker by giving him, or them, treatment suffici - ent to bring about a period of insanity for the duration of the 50 trial. This, more than anything else, would discredit them, but it is dangerous to practise this, in the extreme. Psychopolitics should avoid murder and violence, unless it is done in the safety of the institution, on persons who have been proven to be insane. Where institution deaths appear to be unnecessary, or to rise in \"unreasonable number\", political capital might be made of this by city officials or legislature. If the psychopolitical operative has, himself, or if his group has done a thorough job, defamatory data concerning the person, or con - nections, of the wou ld - be attacker should be on file, should be documented, and should be used in such a way as to discourage the inquiry. After a period of indoctrination, a country will expect insanity to be met with psychopolitical violence. Psychopolitical activities sho uld become the only recognized treatment for insanity. In - deed, this can be extended to such a length that it could be made illegal for electric shock and brain surgery to be omitted in the treatment of a patient. In order to defend psychopolitical activ ities, a great complexity should be made of psychiatric, psychoanalytical, and psycho - logical technology. Any hearing should be burdened by termin - ology too difficult to be transcribed easily. A great deal should be"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 41 made out of such terms of schizophreni a, paranoia, and other relatively undefinable states. Psychopolitical test need not necessary be in agreement, one to another, where they are available to the public. Various types of insanity should be characterized by difficult terms. The actual state s hould be made obscure, but by this verbiage it can be built into the court or investigating mind that a scientific approach exist and that is too complex for him to understand. It is not to be imagined that a judge or a committee of investigation should in quire too deeply into the subject of insanity, since they, themselves, part of the indoctrinated masses, are already intimi - dated if the psychopolitical activity has caused itself to be well - documented in terms of horror in magazines. In case of a heari ng or trial, the terribleness of insanity itself, its thread to the society, should be exaggerated until the court or committee believes that the psychopolitical operative is vitally 51 necessary in his post and should not be harrassed for the activitie s of persons who are irrational. An immediate attack upon the sanity of the attacker before any possible hearing can take place is the very best defence. It should become well - known that \"only the insane attack psychia - trists\". The by - word should be buil t into the society that paranoia is a condition \"in which the individual believes he is being attacked by Communists\". It will be found that this defence is effective. Part of the effective defences should include the entire lack in the society of any rea l psychotherapy. This must be systematically stamped out, since a real psychotherapy might possibly uncover the results of psychopolitical activities. Jurisprudence, in a Capitalistic nation, is of such clumsiness that cases are invariably tried in their newspapers. We have handled these things much better in Russia, and have uniformly brought people to trial with full confessions already arrived at (being implanted) before the trial took place. Should any whisper, or pamphlet, against psychopolitical act ivities be published, it should be laughed into scorn, branded an immediate hoax, and its perpetrator or publisher should be, at the first opportunity, branded as insane, and by the use of drugs the insanity should be confirmed. 52 CHAPTER XI THE USE OF PSYCHOPOLITICS IN SPREADING COMMUNISM"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 42 Reactionary nations are of such a composition that they attack a word without understanding of it. As the conquest of a nation by Communism depends upon imbuing its population with Com - munistic tenets, it is not nece ssary that the term \"Communism\" be applied at first to the educative measures employed. As an example, in the United States we have been able to alter the works of William James, and others, into a more acceptable pattern, and to place the tenets of Karl Marx, Pavlov, Lamarck, and the data of Dialectic Materialism into the textbooks of psychology, to such a degree that anyone thoroughly studying psychology becomes at once a candidate to accept the reasonable - ness of Communism. As every chair of psycholog y in the United States is occupied by persons in our connection, or who can be influenced by persons in our connection, the consistent employment of such texts is guaranteed. They are given the authoritative ring, and they are carefully taught. Constant p ressure in the legislatures of the United States can bring about legislation to the effect that every student attending a high school or university must have classes in psychology. Educating broadly the educated strata of the populace into the tenets of C ommunism is thus rendered relatively easy, and when the choice is given them whether to continue in a Capital - istic or a Communist condition, they will see, suddenly, in Com - munism, much more reasonability than in Capitalism, which will now be of our own definition. 53 CHAPTER XII VIOLENT REMEDIES As populaces, in general, understand that a violence is neces - sary in the handling of the insane, violent remedies seem to be reasonable. Starting from a relatively low level of violence, such as strait - jac kets and other restraints, it is relatively easy to en - croach upon the public diffidence for violence by adding more and more cruelty into the treatment of the insane. By increasing the brutality of \"treatment\", the public expec - tance of such treatment will be assisted, and the protest of the individual to whom the treatment is given is impossible, since immediately after the treatment he is incapable. The family of the individual under treatment is suspect for having in its midst, already, an insane per son. The family's protest should be dis - credited. The more violent the treatment, the more command value the psychopolitical operative will accumulate. Brain operations should become standard and commonplace. While the"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 43 figures of actual deaths should be repressed wherever possible, nevertheless, it is of no great concern the the psychopolitical operative that many deaths do occur. Gradually, the public should be educated into electric shock, first by believing that it is very therapeutic, then by believi ng that it is quieting, then by being informed that electric shock usually injures the spine and teeth, and finally, that it very often kills or at least breaks the spine and removes, violently, the teeth of the patient. It is very doubtful if anyone from the lay levels of the public could tolerate the observation of a single electric shock treatment. Certainly they could not tolerate witnessing a pre - frontal lobotomy of a trans - orbital leucotomy. However, they should be brought up to a level where this is possible, where it is the expected treatment, and where the details, of the treatment itself can be made known, thus to the increase of psychopolitical prestige. The more violent the treatment, the more hopeless insanity will seem to be. 54 The societ y should be worked up to the level where every recalcitrant young man can be brought into court and assigned to a psychopolitical operative, be given electric shocks, and reduced into unimaginative docility for the remainder of his days. By continuous and increasing advertising of the violence of treatment, the public will at last come to tolerate the creation of zombie conditions to such a degree that they will probably employ zombies, if given to them. Thus a large strata of the society, particularly tha t which was rebellious, can be reduced to the service of the psychopolitician. By various means, a public must be convinced, at least, that insanity can only be met by shock, torture, deprivation, defama - tion, discreditation, violence, maiming, death, pu nishment in all its forms. The society, at the same time, must be educated into the belief of increasing insanity within its ranks. This creates an emergency, and places the psychopolitician in a saviour role, and places him, at length, in charge of the so ciety. 55 CHAPTER XIII THE RECRUITING OF PSYCHOPOLITICAL DUPES The psychopolitical dupe is a well - trained individual who serves in complete obedience the psychopolitical operative. In that nearly all persons in training are expected to undergo a certai n amount of treatment in any field of the mind, it is not too difficult to persuade persons in the field of mental healing to subject themselves to mild or minor drugs or shock. If this can be done, a psychological dupe on the basis of pain - drug hypnosis c an immediately result."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 44 Recruitment into the ranks of \"mental healing\" can best be done by carefully bringing to it only those healing students who are, to some slight degree, already depraved, or who have been \"treated\" by psychopolitical operatives. Rec ruitment is effected by making the field of mental healing very attractive, financially<,> and sexually. The amount of promiscuity which can be induced in mental patients can work definitely to the advantage of the psycho - political recruiting agent. The dupe can thus be induced into many lurid sexual contacts, and these, properly witnessed, can thereafter be used as blackmail material to assist any failure of pain - drug hypnosis in causing him to execute orders. The promise of unlimited sexual opportuniti es, the promise of complete dominion over the bodies and minds of helpless patients, the promise of complete lawlessness without detection, can thus attract to \"mental healing\" many desirable recruits who will willingly fall in line with psychopolitical ac tivities. In that the psychopolitician has under his control the insane of that nation, most of them have criminal tendencies, and as he can, as his movement goes forward, recruit for his ranks the criminals themselves, he has unlimited numbers of human b eings to employ on whatever project he may see fit. In that the insane will execute destructive projects without question, if given the proper amount of punishment and implantation, the degradation of the country's youth, the defamation of its leaders, the subor - ning of its courts becomes childishly easy. 56 The psychopolitician has the advantage of naming as a delu - sory symptom any attempt on the part of a patient to expose commands. The psychopolitician should carefully adhere to institutions and sh ould eschew private practice wherever possible, since this gives him the greatest number of human beings to control the use of Communism. When he does act in private practice, it should be only in contact with the families of the wealthy and the officials of the country. 57 CHAPTER XIV THE SMASHING OF RELIGIOUS GROUPS You must know that until recent times the complete subject of mental derangement, whether so light as simple worry or so heavy as insanity, was the sphere of activity of the church and only the church."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 45 Traditionally in civilized nations and barbaric ones the priest - hood alone had in complete charge the mental condition of the citizen. As a matter of great concern to the psychopolitician this tendency still exists in every public in the Wes tern World and scientific inroads into this sphere has occurred only in official and never in public quarters. The magnificent tool welded for us by Wundt would be as nothing if it were not for official insistence in civilized countries that \"scientific p ractices\" be applied to the problem of the mind. Without this official insistence or even if it relapsed for a moment, the masses would grasp stupidity for the priest, the minister, the clergy when mental condition came in question. Today in Europe and Ame rica \"scientific practices\" in the field of the mind would not last moments if not enforced entirely by officialdom. It must be carefully hidden that the incidence of insanity has increased only since these \"scientific practices\" were applied. Great remar ks must be made of \"the pace of modern living\" and other myths as the cause of the increased neurosis in the world. It is nothing to us what causes it if anything does. It is everything to us that no evidence of any kind shall be tolerated afoot to permit the public tendency toward the church its way. If given their heads, if left to themselves to decide, independent of official - dom, where they would place their deranged loved ones, the public would choose religious sanatoriums and would avoid as if plague d places where \"scientific practices\" prevail. Given any slightest encouragement, public support would swing on an instant all mental healing into the hands of the churches. And there are Churches waiting to receive it, clever churches. That terrible mons ter the Roman Catholic Church 58 still dominates mental healing heavily throughout the Christian world and their well schooled priests are always at work to turn the public their way. In the field of pure healing the Church of Christ Science of Boston, Massachusetts excells in commanding the public favour and operates many sanatoriums. All these must be swept aside. They must be ridiculed and defamed and every cure they advertise must be asserted as a hoax. A full fifth of a psychopolitician's time shoul d be devoted to smashing these threats. Just as in Russia we had to destroy, after many many years of the most arduous work, the Church, so we must destroy all faiths in nations marked for conquest. Insanity must be made to hound the footsteps of every pr iest and practitioner. His best results must be turned to jibbering insanities no matter what means we have to use. You need not care what effect you have upon the public. The effect you care about is the one upon officials. You must recruit every agency of the nation marked for slaughter into a foaming hatred of religious healing. You must suborne district attorneys and judges into an intense belief as fervent as an ancient faith in God that Christian Science or any other"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 46 religious practice which might de vote itself to mental healing is vicious, bad, insanity - causing, publicly hated and intolerable. You must suborne and recruit any medical healing organiza - tion into collusion in this campaign. You must appeal to their avarice and even their humanity to invite their co - operation in smashing all religious healing and thus, to our end, care of the insane. You must see that such societies have only qualified Communist - indoctrines as their advisers in this matter. For you can use such societies. They are stup id and stampede easily. Their cloak and degrees can be used quite well to mask any operation we care to have masked. We must make them partners in our endeavour so that they will never be able to crawl from beneath our thumb and discredit us. We have batt led in America since the century's turn to bring to nothing any and all Christian influences and we are succeeding. While we today seem to be kind to the Christian remember we have yet to influence the \"Christian world\" to our ends. When that is done we sh all have an end of them everywhere. You may 59 see them here in Russia as trained apes. They do not know their tether is long only until the apes in other lands have become unwary. You must work until \"religion\" is synonymous with \"insanity\". You must work until the officials of city, county and state govern - ments will not think twice before they pounce upon religious group as public enemies. Remember, all lands are governed by the few and only pretend to consult with the many. It is no different in A merica. The petty official, the maker of laws alike can be made to believe the worst. It is not necessary to convince the masses. It is only necessary to work incessantly upon the official, using personal defamations, wild lies, false evidences and constan t propaganda to make him fight for you against church or against any practitioner. Like the official the bona - fide medical healer also believes the worst if it can be shown to him as dangerous competition. And like the Christian, should be seek to take fr om us any right we have gained, we shall finish him as well. We must be like the vine upon the tree. We use the tree to climb and then, strangling it, grow into power on the nourish - ment of its flesh. We must strike from our path any opposition. We must use for our tool any authority that comes to hand. And then at last, the decades sped, we can dispense with all authority save our own and triumph in the greater glory of the Party. 60 "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 47 CHAPTER XV PROPOSALS WHICH MUST BE AVOIDED There are certain damag ing movements which could interrupt a psychopolitical conquest. These, coming from some quarters of the country, might gain headway and should be spotted before they do, and stamped out. Proposals may be made by large and powerful group in the country to return the insane to the care of those who have handled mental healing for tribes and populaces for centuries - - the priest. Any movement to place clerygymen in charge of institutions should be fought on the grounds of incompetence and the insanity brought about by religion. The most destructive thing which could happen to a psychopolitical programme would be the investment of the ministry with the care of the nation's insane. If mental hospitals operated by religious group are in exist - ence, the must be discredited and closed, no matter what the cost, for it might occur that the actual figures of recovery in such institutions would become known, and that the lack of recovery in general institutions might be compared to them, and this might lead to a movem ent to place the clergy in charge of the insane. Every argument must be advanced early, to overcome any possibility of this ever occurring. A country's law must carefully be made to avoid any rights of person to the insane. Any suggested laws or Constitut ional Amendments which make the harming of the insane unlawful, should be fought to the extreme, on the ground that only violent measures can succeed. If the law were to protect the insane, as it normally does not, the entire psychopolitical programme woul d very possibly collapse. Any movements to increase or place under surveillance the orders required to hospitalized the mentally ill should be discour - aged. This should be left entirely in the hand of person well under the control of psychopolitical oper atives. It should be done with minimum formality, and no recovery of the insane from an 61 institution should be possible by any process of law. Thus, any movement to add the legal steps of the processes of commit - ment and release should be discourage on the ground of emer - gency. To obviate this, the best action is to place a psychiatric and detention ward of the mentally ill in every hospital in a land. Any writing of a psychopolitical nature, accidentally disclosing themselves, should prevented. All actual literature on the subject of insanity and its treatment should be suppressed, first by actual security, and second by complex verbiage which renders it incomprehensible. The actual figures of recovery or death should never be announced in any paper s. Any investigation attempting to discover whether or not psychiatry or psychology has ever cured anyone should immediately be discouraged and laughed to"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 48 scorn, and should mobilize at that point all psycho - political operatives. At first, it should be ign ored, but if this is not possible, the entire weight of all psychopoliticians in the nation should be pressed into service. Any tactic possible should be employed to prevent this from occurring. To rebut it, technical appearing papers should exist as to th e tremendous number of cures effected by psychiatry and psychology, and whenever possible, percentages of cures, no matter how fictitious, should be worked into legislative papers, thus forming a background of \"evidence\" which would immediately rebut any e ffort to actually discover anyone who had ever been helped by psychiatry or psychology. If the Communistic connections of a psychopolitician should become disclosed, it should be attributed to his own carelessness, and he should, himself, be immediately b randed as eccentric within his own profession. Authors of literature which seek to demonstrate the picture of a society under complete mental control and duress should be helped toward infamy or suicide to discredit their works. Any literature liberalizi ng any healing practice should be immediately fought and defeated. All healing practices should gravitate entirely to authoritative levels, and no other opinions should be admitted, as these might lead to exposure. Movements to improve youth should be inv aded and corrup - 62 ted, as this might interrupt campaigns to produce in youth delin - quency, addiction, drunkenness, and sexual promiscuity. Communist workers in the field of newspapers and radio should be protected wherever possible by striking out o f action, through Psychopolitics, any persons consistently attacking them. These, in their turn, should be persuaded to give every possible publicity to the benefits of psychopolitical activities under the heading of \"science\". No healing group devoted to the mind must be allowed to exist within the borders of Russia or its satellites. Only well - vouched - for psychopolitical operatives can be continued in their practice, and this only for the benefit of the government or against enemy prisoners. Any effort to exclude psychiatrists or psychologist from the armed services must be fought. Any inquest into the \"suicide\" or sudden mental derangement of any political leader in a nation must be conducted only by psychopolitical operatives or their dupes, whether Psychopolitics is responsible or not."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 49 Death and violence against persons attacking Communism in a nation should be eschewed as forbidden. Violent activity against such person might bring about their martyrdom. De - famation, and the accusation of insanity, alone should be em - ployed, and they should be brought at last under the ministrations of psychopolitical operatives, such as psychiatrists and controlled psychologists. 63 CHAPTER XVI IN SUMMARY In this time of unlimited weapons, and in national antag onisms where atomic war with Capitalistic powers is possible, Psycho - politics must act efficiently as never before. Any and all programmes of Psychopolitics must be increased to aid and abet the activities of other Communist agents through - out the natio n in question. The failure of Psychopolitics might well bring about the atomic bombing of the Motherland. If Psychopolitics succeeded in its mission throughout the Capi - talistic nations of the world, there will never be an atomic war, for Russia will ha ve subjugated all of her enemies. Communism has already spread across one - sixth of the in - habited world. Marxist Doctrines have already penetrated the remainder. An extension of the Communist social order is every - where victorious. The spread of Communi sm has never been by force of battle, but by conquest of the mind. In Psychopolitics we have refined this conquest to its last degree. The psychopolitical operative must succeed, for his success means a world of Peace. His failure might well mean the dest ruc - tion of the civilized portions of Earth by atomic power in the hands of Capitalistic madmen. The end thoroughly justifies the means. The degradation of populaces is less inhuman than their destruction by atomic fission, for to an animal who lives onl y once, and life is sweeter than death. The end of war is the control of a conquered people. If a people can be conquered in the absence of war, the end of war will have been achieved without the destruction of war. A worthy goal. The psychopolitician ha s his reward in the nearly unlimited control of populaces, in the uninhibited exercise of passion, and the glory of Communist conquest over the stupidity of the enemies of the People."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"THE BRAINWASHING MANUAL Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 50 THE END 64 PUBLISHED AS A PUBLIC SERVICE BY THE HUBBARD COLLEGE OF SCIENTOLOGY SAINT HILL MANOR EAST GRINSTEAD SUSSEX, ENGLAND "}]
