Warning Containing highly controversial techniques of psychic seduction, this book merely serves as a tool to promulgate hidden knowledge as a form of entertainment. In no way does the author endorse the use of these techniques to bend the will of others. You the reader, are advised to exercise necessary discretion and to consult your personal code of ethics. Ponder this well. At the end of this manual, you will have mastered arcane wisdom which allows you to arouse feelings of attraction. Inciting infatuation in the minds of others will come easily. This is no power to be taken lightly. Use it wisely . Preface The magic of mental seduction and control. It is the ultimate power. Envision yourself stepping into a room exuding tremendous charisma. Feel yourself bathing in the stares of many admiring, fawning eyes. What would you give to wield such power? Notice how some people “just seem to have it?” And strangely, many of them are average looking. Their manner of dress may be nondescript. Physically, they have unremarkable features. But somehow... an aura of appeal, charm, dominant sexuality emanates and draws others like flies to a honey pot. These men and women are naturally endowed with mental powers that subconsciously draw others to them. But don’t despair that you’re missing out on the fun. The techniques and instructions that you are about to learn in this book will unleash that power! The idea that you have the power within you to change your reality is not implausible. It’s been done it for ages. So why haven’t you learned or heard about these techniques before? Well, there is a gamut of possible reasons why this valuable type of knowledge has slipped from your hands. Some reasons might involve the secrecy of occult cults, atrociously priced courses and lectures, and systems shrouded in religions. Mind power skills, sadly, have largely been underdeveloped for the aforementioned reasons. Mostly, however, it is because mystical knowledge is considered passé in this day and age. Society cannot reconcile the intangible with the scientific world. Such is the folly of mankind and the reason for slow progress over the centuries. Scientists of the old were considered crackpots, magicians and lunatics only because the forces they dealt with were largely invisible and misunderstood. It took eons to generate acceptance for the theories which we now take for granted, such as gravity and the existence of radio waves. Today, we are no different from the myopic men of the past. We close our eyes in skepticism to powers that are out of the realm of our experience. Extrasensory perception, magick, thought waves, psycho kinesis, and parapsychology are still subject to much scoffing and skepticism. Perhaps in the future, magic, thought waves and human frequencies may transform into household science. The Mind The mind has conceived millions of thoughts and ideas which have shaped our world; hence mind power is a form of strength. What you will be able to do after you read this book is to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"2 strengthen your ability to think and use your thoughts to shape reality . This is the ultimate reason you purchased this manual: to influence others and your environment. Once you learn how to unleash the power of your thoughts, you will detect subtle but wonderful changes in your life. Enhancing your thought energy is accomplished by one main skill-- becoming conscious. You must be aware of your true self, and your surroundings. I will teach you how to ‘become fully conscious’ like a zen master. Consciousness is of penultimate importance for psychically- induced mental influence. Throughout this manual, you will develop your powers of concentration and visualization. These skills are the foundation of mind power control. Having accomplished these basic skills, you will learn how to activate and heighten your other senses of hearing, touch and smell to further intensify the control you possess over your hidden powers. Hidden Frequencies It is important that you understand that there is more that goes on around you than you are aware of. An illustration, for clarity: You carry within your belief system certain things that you cannot see with your eyes. You don’t think about these things; nevertheless, you affirm its existence. For instance, you detect aromas but you cannot generally see the odor as it wafts in the air. You snuggle in front of television, but you cannot see the radio waves coming into your antenna. You can hear music sounds from a hi-fi but you can’t generally see those sound vibrations with your eyes. You cannot see these things with your physical eyes in everyday living but a part of you is conscious of these seemingly invisible things. Is it not intriguing that you are not able to see many things around you; nevertheless you are conscious or aware of the fact that they do exist. These invisible entities are not a bizarre concept to you even though you might not fully understand the science behind them. You absorb it within and take it as a reality. When it transforms into your reality, you usually don’t give it conscious thought. With all the invisible frequencies, radio waves, and plasma emanations that pass through us from our environment, why do we overlook that there is human invisible frequency that passes through us? The knowledge that your mind has the ability to affect the events and world around has been toyed around for eons. It has been ascribed various labels, such as positive thinking , goal discernment and even white magic. The mind has tremendous power. And truly, it can create reality out of the immaterial. Seduction and mental influence is just a small fraction of the applications of mind power. It is necessary to learn about the unseen things around you. This invisible world around you will become your reality as you begin to practice mind power techniques. Through discipline, you can reign in your untapped powers and focus it upon results. Unlike chaotic invisible particles zooming around your meatloaf in a microwave, the invisible energy realms around you can be harnessed and taken control of. You may never actually see these invisible realms with your physical vision, but this will never stop you from wielding these unseen forces to realize your wishes. As you begin to do this, this new awareness will become your reality, and then emanations coming from your brain to the brain of others will become as easy as activating your TV set. By harnessing such thought waves, you induce a strong psychic"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"3 rapport which serves to attract others irresistibly to you. The ultimate aim of this tome is to allow you to influence others without ever uttering a word or making explicit gestures. It is solely through your mind that you will control, seduce and manipulate the will of others. Understand that you are going to be learning how to influence others through covert tactics. The techniques presented in this manual are for the mental seduction of others. A bonus is that the system can be extended to suit your other needs. Furthermore, this book also teaches you how to use the universal forces for other self-improvement purposes. Psychic healing, telepathy and psychic command are among them. Just as with Ph.D of Persuasion, most of the theory has been milled away, leaving the core application of mind power techniques. This book seeks to teach methods with as minimal explanation of theory as possible. Just as you operate a TV with the barest perception to its operation, you will confidently activate your latent powers of mental influence without understanding why it is working in the first place. But rest assured, it WILL work. From the moment of its conception, this book was destined to be a concise manual under thirty pages, which will be a “survival book” to be rapidly referred to. The development of this book actually began four years ago, but its release had been temporarily halted because much study was first carried out to ascertain the veracity of its theory and application. Use this book as a reference for mind power developments. Read once, then get about practicing the techniques. Don’t stop your training at any level. Push on and reap the benefits. Remember that only you possess this power. That is your advantage. (For any further questions on theory, kindly participate in the forum or mailing list. Your queries will be attended to there.) In a while you will master mental seduction techniques; you shall insert potent thoughts into others minds compelling others to be attracted to you as if it was their own idea. Powerful? Truly. This is ultimate influence since the person never realizes they are being seduced! You hold a powerful weapon of seduction. Wield your powers wisely."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"4 Chapter one Energy is All Around Us There are unseen waves of energy all around us all the time. Where they have come from, and where they are off too, few of us know. How many different waves there are around us, nobody can be certain. Technology, through science has discovered a few of them in recent years, but how many others are out there or in here, is a mystery. They’ve been around as long as the world has been around. For example, the room you are sitting in now is filled with all kinds of energy waves and currents. Take the TV, and plug it in. Now tune it. What results? A sharp screen. Music. Commercials. Perhaps a soap opera. Electricity is the driver of the TV set. And just as electricity is invisible, so are the myriad of other frequencies which can be controlled solely by thought. These are the frequencies you should master in order to effect mental influence. Scientists admit that they know little about energy. They know that it is, of course, but they don’t know what it is. Isn’t it stupendous that in an era where electricity is commanded at will, we still don’t truly know what it is, or why it works? It does work, and that is enough for most of us. There is also an energy, a life force that flows to the ends of the universe. This energy is endowed with characteristics that make it susceptible to mental control. Called by many names, such as orgone , prana and ki , it is the stuff of life. Existence will be impossible without it. It is an untapped reservoir, inextinguishable and exceedingly potent. This energy is shaped by our thoughts and it in turn shapes our reality. The events in your life are the result of what you have chosen to allow into your life. When you improve at consciously shaping your life from your thoughts, you will see it happen and see just how it unravels. If you were to envision a red Ferrari parked in your driveway and looked outside, you won’t see it. Your mind will always give you what you want but it performs through the events and hidden energies around you. You may win the car in a raffle, or your friend will pass by and lend you one. Your goals eventually will materialize but you will have to know what to look for and just how to be patient. Actually, this is the basis for all witchcraft (black and white), magic, and mystic ceremonies. Energy (and all other hidden frequencies) is concentrated in a series of rituals intended to condense and distill it with a forcefully created objective and it is subsequently released into the environment to manifest into a reality. Energy is shaped by thought for an outcome. All magic works by this principle. We create realities from our thoughts because our thoughts travel through the hidden energies and these thoughts materialize into tangible form. Notice how well positive thinking works? Positive thinking harnesses positive energies and effects favorable outcomes most of the time. This is the simplest use of energy. But since it requires little effort, positive thinking is not as concentrated, nor as effective as true psychic or mental control. There is a superior technique to gain control of the hidden energy waves in order to attain irresistible power."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"5 Visualization In order to allow your thoughts to manipulate your life and your environment you must see it within you using your inner vision. That is the concept of visualizing and it is the foundation of your coursework for mind power development. You must learn to see in your mind’s eye. When you achieve an even more advanced state, you must be able, at will, to feel, touch and smell whatever you visualize. At this heightened level, you can influence anyone with the snap of your fingers. Make this your goal. When you see your goal in your mind as if it was actually happening, you are in effect tricking your subconscious. Your mind’s eye sets off a chain reaction. This is where everything starts. Your imagination gets the ball rolling and then the part of your mind that can influence events kicks in. Holding an image in your mind is a necessary step to manifest your desires. Mental Arousal When you are using your mind to seduce others, remember that your clarity must be laser-sharp. What you see in your mind and the way you do it must be as clear as you can get it. You need your mind to develop a rapport with the person but once this rapport is made, your main thrust should be on the clearest manipulation of your thoughts. The previous discussion on energy, visualization set the framework of mind power seduction and control. It is within this system that the methods of Psychic Seduction™ rests. Recap It is at this point when theory steps aside for application. You do not need to understand how things work, just know that it does. The previous discussion served merely to give a handle hold on the mysteries you will attempt to control. Before moving on to the meat and potatoes of this course, remember once more the vital concepts: • Thought creates reality. Irrefutable evidence has proven this. Bridges, buildings, even mathematical treatises initially started out as thoughts in the minds of their inventors. • Thought can influence the minds of others and all worldly events through visualization. The clearer the visualization, and the more involved all the senses are, the more potent the effect. • Energy ( prana, orgone) infuse thoughts with power and magnifies its effects. By manipulating energy (this will be discussed later), you will be able to generate sufficient force to create reality from thoughts. • When reality is generated from thought, it may not be exactly the way you expected it, but it will be along the same theme. Using your mind power to create a house will not cause a house to appear out of mid-air, but it will channel events leading to the possession of a house. For instance, you may “run into” a real estate broker with a low-priced house who will sell you a charming little chalet. Your thoughts drew him to you."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"6 Chapter Two Lowering Brain Frequencies to Get in Sync Your brain functions like a television set—it receives and emits electrical impulses. These frequencies are the intervals in which electrical activity within your brain cells are measured. Everything around you emits frequencies that can be measured and charted. Everything from a telephone to car engines to computer monitors to a lightning storm. Colors emit frequencies. All life, likewise, emit these impulses. These unseen frequencies all traverse through you. The Earth itself vibrates with an assortment of frequencies. You and the planet resonate with each other and share energy between each other. The Schumann Resonance Theory points out that the earth’s magnetic field vibrates at a steady 7.83Hz tone This is the resonance frequency of the Earth's magnetic field, making it a very natural meditation frequency for meditation. If you can somehow lower your bodily and mental frequencies to this level, you tune in to the vast unquenchable supply of life energies pervading the entire planet. It is this energy that will enable you to empower your thoughts and project it with such force that reality is reshaped with your mind alone. In order to unleash your mind seduction techniques on the person you are trying to influence, you infuse your thoughts with this Shumann Resonance frequency and draw upon yourself a vortex of energy. Hence, your thoughts become concrete and real and actually have an effect in the environment. There is another reason why you want to lower your brain frequency to the 7.83Hz level. At this tone, your thoughts easily penetrate the minds of others at a subliminal level. The bottom- line: you create strong emotions and feelings within the other person that he accepts to be his own. This is of vital importance! When you fully grasp the frequencies of the mind, you’ll understand how other people’s thought waves can easily get in sync with yours. Your environment (infused with energy) will assist in this exhilarating process. Thus the key to mind power control and all other forms of psychic manipulation (telepathy, healing, etc) is to lower your mental frequency to match the earth’s, and thereby tune in. Once in sync with the planet, you automatically absorb large quantities of energy that you can project into your thoughts. Thus you will find your power to manifest will happen easier and quicker. Extensive research established that the human brain vibrates at certain frequencies depending upon what the mind is doing. EEG results show that when a person is wide awake, the frequency range of the brain/mind is 14 - 30 cps (cycles per second or hertz). This is known as the “beta” state of mind. In this condition, the mind is engaged in active pursuits and alert. Below the beta state of mind are a series of other mental conditions. The chart illustrates:"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"7 ALPHA: 7 - 13 cps Day dreaming condition; highly meditative state. Associated with super learning and enhanced memory THETA: 3.5 - 7 cps Deeply relaxed condition; the exact moment when you fall asleep. Associated with extrasensory skills and psychic abilities. DELTA: 0.5 – 3.5 cps Deep, very deep sleep. A stage of heightened immunity. You unconsciously access all of these different states throughout the day. When you have sufficiently advanced your mind, you can access or get into any of these states at will. Let this be one of your objectives. These four states meld together so that you experience high and lows of each brainwave state. If your brainwaves hum at 7hz, it could be considered low alpha or very high theta. When your brain accesses these different states, you experience things differently and your thoughts acquire surprising effects on you and your environment The alpha and theta state is found to be the most effective condition for mind power exercises. The lower the state, the more rested your brain is. In conclusion here are three main reasons why you need to change your brainwave cycle when you want to mentally control others or your environment just with your mind: • You vibrate at the Shumann Resonance which allows you to tune in to the earth’s natural field. At resonance level, you draw in massive amounts of energy which empower your thoughts for irresistible control. • Your ability to use your mind increases and empowers your mind power work. You must be able to access different states of awareness and different levels of consciousness. In these states, your heart rate slows down and your body relaxes. Your mind will have more time to effect the objectives of your techniques. Ultimately, it is your focus that does the job. Technique to Lower Your BrainWave State. Before you ever attempt mind seduction, telepathy, healing, or magick, first lower your brainwave state. The ideal state is the theta state. At this level, you are supremely relaxed. You know you have reached the theta state when you are no longer conscious of your body. Outside sounds and impressions no longer register upon your senses. All that is and everything that shall be, exists in your mind. It is only your mind and your mind’s thoughts that exist in the theta state. At the theta state, you are vibrating at the earth’s frequency (some people actually feel ripples and tremors) and absorbing a great deal of energy. Your thoughts are lucid... and more importantly, very very powerful. So the first step is to lower your brain wave state. There are three methods. The first is The Brainwave Entrainment Technique™, the second is the Corrector Technique™ , and the third is the Color Entrainment Technique™. All are powerful."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"8 The Brainwave Entrainment Technique ™ On the Psychic Seduction website is a special “preset” data file to be used with the Brainwave Generator ™ (created by Noramaa Solutions). The preset is called Deep Mind Three which generates the Shumann Resonance frequency. This file uses binaural rhythms with the sole objective of causing your brainwaves to lower to the ideal level. Import the preset and activate Brainwave Generator. It will take about 5 minutes for your brain to descend to a relaxing theta level. While listening to the sounds from your headphones, you must be lying down, legs uncrossed and arms at the sides. Avoid placing pillows under your head (you may get a cricked neck.) With the lights out, and the doors locked, close your eyes, breathe slowly and deeply and listen to the music guide you down a series of relaxed states. You know you’ve reached the theta state when your awareness of the outside world has disappeared. Electronic BrainWave entrainment for those who find it hard to use the Corrector Technique™ and the Color Entrainment Technique™. It is alright to use this technique for short term only. After awhile, you should rely on your own power to bring down your brainwave state. Depending on the external systems for relaxation is like using a crutch to walk forever. Eventually, you must walk on your own. On a side note, please be forewarned of the expected side-effects of this mp3 file (all very GOOD I assure you.) First, this program decreases your need for sleep. You will notice needing less than 6 hours of rest per day. Second, your energy levels will increase after each listening. It is like waking from a long nap. Finally, you may experience flashes of creativity and extreme lucidity. Feel free to use this program file for other purposes other than mind power preparation. Using these brainwave regulating frequencies on a regular basis has a known side-effect of permanently conditioning the mind. Listening to theta sound waves daily forces your brain to resonate at this frequency even long after the listening session. The impact, hence, is residual. When your mind resonates at the theta frequency, expect the following to occur: enhanced learning, increased psychic experiences and intuition, boosted immune systems and of course, the need for less sleep. The Corrector Technique™ At the front of your brain is a part known as the corrector. This is the section which coordinates the work of the brain and all its parts. Place you palm on your forehead; the corrector is about 3- 5 cm beneath. In order to reach the theta state, you must learn to cool the corrector. To achieve this, you should imagine that the temperature of the corrector is lower than the temperature of the rest of your brain. First rub your forehead, and get a feel of where your corrector is. Then, try to feel it slowly freezing and turning into a block of ice. This imagination leads to the constriction of the corrector’s blood vessels. By consciously lowering the temperature of the brain, you lower your brainwave state. After doing this, you will notice that your thoughts have gone dull. Fewer thoughts and emotions cross your mind. The brain will eventually vibrate at a lower level. At a point, no thoughts may be present anymore. This is the theta level."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"9 The Color-Entrainment Technique ™ For the visually oriented, this technique can drop brainwave rates to theta very rapidly. The Colors Technique enables you to achieve the mental powers you have set out to possess. Recall the colors of the rainbow? Here’s a refresher: Red, Orange Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet. In order to achieve the theta brainwave state. You must lie down, uncross your legs and arms, and breathe in slowly. After awhile, envision in your mind’s eye any red object. See an apple, Or perhaps a red Corvette. Really visualize it three dimensionally and drink in the detail. See the shimmer, the sparkle. Hold the image for about thirty seconds then fade the picture away. Start visualizing any orange object. It can be the orange fruit or a basketball. See the ridges on the basketball. Imagine the roughness of its hide. Fade the image away then do the same for Yellow until you have reached the color Violet. At this point, your brain is vibrating at low Alpha levels. Proceed to deepen the relaxation state: When all the colors have been visualized, imagine yourself appearing in front of a staircase that is leading downwards into the darkness. There are EXACTLY 21 steps. Step down to the first step and feel the sensation of actually stepping down. Step down onto the second step and experience the impression of descent. Do the same till the 21 st step. Upon reaching this last step, visualize a door ahead. Study it. Notice the details. Is it wood? Steel? Plastic. This is the door to your special place . A highly spiritual plane. Open the door and imagine your dream world . It may be a lake, a mountain range, even outer space. Whatever you choose, make sure it isn’t the place where you are now. You have entered a place where you can retreat to for hours on end just to meditate, to think, to converse with whatever denizen you decide to manifest here. This is you sacred place. Your sacred place vibrates with energy. Breathe in and imagine absorbing tremendous amounts of energy. Do this for about three minutes. Now, you are ready to being the seduction. From now on, this will also be the place where you will conduct all your mind power techniques."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"10 Chapter three Mind Seduction Recall how thoughts have force, and how energy infuses power into your thoughts. While in this special place, you are infused with energy and are vibrating at the special resonance frequency recently discussed. This is the ideal state for mind seduction. Once you have entered your special place, you simply have to imagine the person you wish to influence appearing before you. Try to focus on conjuring a fully three-dimensional image, such that you actually feel his/her presence. In your mind’s eye, picture the sparkle of her eye, smell the muskiness of her perfume. Be aware of her clothes fluttering in the wind. The more intense the visualization, the stronger the mind-link you are creating with the real person. In order to attract this person to you in the real world requires a VERY simple formula. The principle of Psychic Seduction™: Sexual attraction can be instantly effected by mentally undressing and seducing the conjured person you see before you in your dream world. As your mind creates this mental seduction, powerful thoughts are flowing from your mind to hers in the real world. As you seduce her in your special place, her mind is bombarded with escalating sensations of arousal. She will associate these feelings with you and consider you the source of her attraction. Mental seduction takes little effort. First, imagine her naked, and run your fingers through her hair, across her neck and shoulders. Caress her breasts and rim her nipples gently, soothingly. At this point, the image of the person may be wavering and you may even lose sight of her body as a whole. This is no cause for alarm. Just concentrate on the body part that you are caressing and fondling. An awareness that the person you are caressing is the person you seek to arouse is enough. Here is a rule of utmost importance: Visualization must be comprehensive and dynamic. This requires that you don’t only see your hands fondling the object of your desire, you actually feel the sensations of your caress. You must be so immersed in your action that you actually experience the erotic touching and prodding Without the feeling sensations, you lose more than half of your power. Your thoughts will fail to generate enough force to instill desire into the thoughts of your target. Most of your concentration should be directed to the genital area. If your target is a woman, spread her legs and fondle her clitoris and caress her vagina. See the folds of her flesh as you feel the warmth and moistness of her pubic mound. As you mentally ravish the genital area, blood will be surging into the privates of the real person. It will incite desire and extremely intense emotions. She will start to think about you and seek you out. As you caress and fondle her breasts, vagina and legs, make the images dynamic, such that you see the orgasmic expression on her face, you hear little gasps of pleasure and your hands feel the sensation of her quivering flesh. This is called dynamic visioning (TM) and it causes your target to act in that same manner in the real world. It compels her to emotionally behave in the same"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"11 manner. When some time has elapsed, terminate the seduction by finally leading her to a climax. See and feel her buckle and quiver under your hands in the throes of orgasm. Then see her lie still and contented. Allow the image to then fade away. How long does this session require? Twenty minutes should be enough for a start. You will have planted subliminal desire within her by then. As you accomplish such mind power work on someone, the influence on her is instant and physical no matter how far away they are. By caressing the area you are influencing, you produce actual bodily responses, such as wetness and skin flushing. The effects typically last for about an hour. Sometimes prolonged states of arousal can result from very lucid and intense visualizing. Very Important Note As you go about your visualizing, you must take care not to arouse yourself!! The power of your mind will be greatest if you conduct the seduction with an almost clinical disposition. The moment your pulse quickens, the minute your heart pounds from the sexual mental images you generate, you risk speeding up your brainwave pattern beyond the theta levels and back up to the beta levels. YOU WILL CUT THE PSYCHIC CONNECTION THIS WAY! The seduction will cease. This is why control is absolutely necessary. Restrain the horniness within you as you perform your work. Your goal is to attract others to you—not to mentally stimulate yourself. Leave that to crass amateurs and undisciplined individuals. Mental control over others requires strict control of your own emotions. Remember, the more clinical your approach, the better. As you visualize the genitalia you stimulate, pretend to be a doctor. Doctors do not get horny. Follow Up Medicine In order to heighten the attraction to you, you need to re-apply the previous techniques for some days (preferably at night when the mind is easily influenced.) In time, she will overtly manifest her feelings. Signs can involve shyness in your presence to outrageous flirting. You will know the signs when you see it. I have developed a powerful technique to use as a follow-up to the primary method. This secondary technique can be applied almost anywhere, and in vacant time periods to maximize the ongoing arousal you seek to generate. This is called the Organ Heating Method .™ Organ Heating Method ™ To apply this method, you will learn to heat and cool your hands. The first step is to relax. Sit on a chair and prop your hand upon a table. Gaze at your hand. See the folds, the little hairs, the ridges. Then, imagine that it is not yours . Feel its sensations—then imagine that it lives a separate life. You must believe in your mind that it is now an entity distinct from you with its own life force. Dissociate yourself with it. Command your brain that this body part is no longer under your control; tell your brain that there are no nerves connecting this hand to your body. As you do this, your hand may grow cold. Try to move your hand. You will be surprised to see that"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"12 it refuses to budge. At this point, imagine that the hand is heating up. Imagine fire surging into the hand. The technique can be improved by imagining liquid fire coursing down your arm and surging into the hand. As the fire cascades, revel in the imagined sensations of heat. Feel the air rising around the hand. See the glow of the energy. Within two to five minutes, the hand will physically heat up. Your hands will blaze with tingles and spikes of energy. Observe your hand. You will notice angry red splotches. With that little technique, you have manipulated chi / ki energy and caused surplus storage of this etheric energy within your hands and arms. This energy is used by shamans to heal. Warlocks use it to destroy. Martial artists (aikido and kung fu) practitioners deploy ki to defeat larger opponents. Psions use it to manipulate events and affect reality. You will use it for seduction. It takes little time, but once you’ve mastered that little exercise, you can apply it to mental seduction efforts. The trick is to identify your hand or any other personal body part with that of your target’s genitals . You have to perceive your hand and her genitals as one solid object, and afterwards heat up the hand. As the hand heats up, so will her genitals. This is the desired response. Blood will surge into her clitoris and infuse her vaginal walls. Sexual excitement will pound her thoughts. Because of the link, she will associate her feelings of arousal with you. Done on a daily basis, you will create tremendous rapport with the woman you are influencing. Imagine doing this every hour on the hour!! Credo While the Organ Heating Technique™ doesn’t occur in the theta state, it will still work because of the intense psychic link created when the association between hand and genital is made. The constant repetition will all the more enhance its power and create the desired result: sexual attraction, desire, and warmth."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"13 The Final Chapter of Basic Psychic Seduction Applications Psychic Seduction™ can be applied on members of the same sex! Instead of inciting desire, it will instead create strong feelings of warmth and camaraderie. Friendships, working relationships are ideal candidates for revitalization with this method (if you can stomach fondling your best friend’s genitals). The mind control techniques also allow you to obtain favors from strangers, your bosses or even difficult people. Imagine that your hand is your boss’s genitals and heat it up as you request for a raise. He will associate the warm emotions generated, with you. Chances are, you will get that raise. Apply this technique when bargaining at the flea market or purchasing from those notorious used car dealers. People targeted with this technique will perceive you to be charismatic and charming. A Devious Application Psychic Seduction™ boasts of the power to temporarily halt the mental capacity of others. Remember the corrector previously mentioned? Imagine your hand to be someone’s corrector, and cool it down. His thinking processes will grind to a halt. Where can this be applied? When losing a debate with an obviously smarter person is a good time to unleash the vengeance of your iniquities. Healing Purposes Afflicted with pains and anxieties? The best time to cleanse yourself of such maladies is when you are recuperating in your special place . Visit your special place and visualize a small pond of effervescent, shimmering water. Wade into the pond and feel your disease and affliction melt into the pond. As the pond blackens with the disease, feel yourself glow stronger and brighter. When you have reached health, step out of the pond and will it to disappear, together with your sickness. Advanced Psychic Seduction The following sections constitute advanced techniques of psychic seduction. At this level, the practitioner is expected to have mastered beyond the rudiments of simple visualization. It is essential that emotions, feelings, and sensations of touch can be conjured at will. Without this vital ingredient, advanced psychic seduction cannot occur. It takes about one month of continuous practice and visualization in order to properly develop the required abilities. I recommend that you do not proceed to this section without this requirement. Dissatisfaction may result if the techniques fail—and they WILL fail without this prerequisite."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"14 First topic: Advanced Anchoring Advanced Anchoring for Psychic Seduction Altered States Accessing ™ Much of the advanced techniques rely on altered states of the mind. By resonating at the Shumann Resonance, energy is increased and telepathy becomes easy. The problem is that most seduction must occur in the presence of the target and while wide awake. There is a work-around to that dilemma— anchoring. The key is to anchor the altered brainwave state induced during the theta level. In the previous chapters, the Color-Entrainment technique allowed you to access the theta state of mind, and while in that state, you proceeded with psychic seduction. The Color-Entrainment technique can be exploited, if coupled with an anchor, to create altered states almost instantaneously. The goal of anchoring is to create a “push-button” action that can instantly recreate the theta state of mind anytime and anywhere. Here is how: 1. Relax on a chair and use the Color-Entrainment technique to descend to alpha state. Wait a few minutes AFTER reaching the state, then allow yourself to drift to sleep. Do NOT attempt any seduction visualization. At that point called the threshold of sleep, when colors and starbursts are popping in your eyes, and you are aware of impending sleep, anchor the state by joining the thumb of your right hand to your pinky. Mentally vocalize the word “theta” as you do this, then fall asleep. You have set up a powerful anchor that allows you to access the theta state. 2. Psychologists have ascertained that memory becomes permanent if something is repeated eight times. That IS the magic number. We want the power of the anchor to be imbedded deep into your psyche, so step one must be repeated EIGHT times within one day. Space out the exercise by an hour. 3. In order to fire the anchor and access theta state anytime in the future, simply join your thumb to your pinky and silently mutter “theta.” Your mind will automatically resonate at the low level frequencies generated by the Color-Entrainment technique. You are at the optimum psychic seduction mind set. The Seducer’s Mind Set ™ What if you could radiate tremendous sexual energy wherever you go? Imagine—women or men drawn to you like iron to a magnet. Feel tremendous charisma oozing from your pores. Experience a rush as others seem drawn to you for no apparent reason. You can achieve this! Anchoring can effect a powerful change within yourself and augment your telepathic prowess. If you can rewire your brainwave patterns, such that seductive thoughts constantly broadcast from your mind to those around you, attracting others becomes child’s play! The method necessitates a few steps: 1. Fire the anchor discussed in the previous section by joining your thumb to your pinky. It is necessary to alter your brain state."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"15 2. Close your eyes and visualize beautiful women (or men) flanking you. Drink in the detail and be aware of the life that radiates from them. Note the expressions on their faces. The greater the detail, the more powerful the energy you will create. 3. Transform yourself literally into a human attractor with irresistible magnetic properties. Imagine that your body has acquired the molecules of a real lodestone. You are now a living woman magnet. Radiate visible tendrils of force to the women in your periphery. Feel yourself tugging at them, and simultaneously feel them tug back at you. You must ENERGIZE the feeling. Feel your hair stand on end. You are a magnet, and the women are visibly drawn in irresistibly. Note the consternation on their faces melt into desire. Envision that they resist slightly, but ultimately they yield as they physically, emotionally and spiritually get drawn closer and closer. 4. Finally all of them surround and caress you, floating on a high of euphoria. Wallow in the embraces and revel in the emotional sensations of the attraction they feel towards you. They embrace, caress and hug you. 5. At the peak of the experience, anchor the state by joining your thumb to your middle finger and utter “seduction.” You have created a powerful anchor that you can use anytime. 6. The anchor can be further reinforced by redoing the visualization and recalling peak performance experiences, such as during a previous tremendously passionate lovemaking incident. Recall the experience, then as you ride the crest of emotion, anchor it! Join your thumb to your middle finger and utter “seduction.” 7. Occasions that call for an instant seduction booster shot can be served by that anchor. When you release the anchor, you not only overwhelm yourself with positive thoughts, you literally release tendrils of crackling energy towards all those around you. Women in your field of vision may suddenly feel attraction or warmth. Notice that some may even create circumstances to meet you. Perhaps a wink, a brush... someone bumps into you.... Asks a question. 8. Your decisiveness will then determine the outcome of the situation. Act quickly. What is the rationale behind this method? During peak experiences, the mind vibrates at frequencies that affect not just yourself, but others. Psychic emanations branch through space and influence the thoughts of people in the vicinity. Notice how extremely happy people create other happy people; recall how glum individuals pull others down? Emotions are viral. They propagate. Our thoughts affect ourselves and others. The more powerful the emotions, the greater the effect. Seductive thoughts vibrate at intense levels and creates mental frequencies which easily effect amorous influence. Advanced Mind Control Thoughts create reality. The physical world is a tangible manifestation of thoughts. What we see before us once existed in the minds of others. While your thoughts can affect the material plane, so can it alter the thoughts of others. Normally, you cannot simply create a mental command and expect others to do your bidding."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"16 Why can we create tangible reality from thoughts but fail to influence the thoughts of others? What is missing? Energy. Your mind and the mind of others vibrate with etheric matter known as prana (or ki). In order to override someone’s mind, you need to charge your thoughts with far greater energy. Finding the cosmic switch and plugging into vast untapped energy is easier than you can imagine, because all the necessary tools already hum away within you... these psychic power centers are known as your chakras . You possess an advantage over others when you can manipulate your chakras at will. Chakras are whirling balls of energy. Kirlian photography proved the existence of these energy centers. Invisible, these energy balls number over a hundred. Major and minor energy centers are located throughout your body and provide you with psychic energy. These charkas draw energy from your environment and act as refining and distribution centers for your astral body. Aikido masters are adept at manipulating these centers. Some have advanced to the degree of crushing the charkas of others and incapacitating larger opponents. But such skill is not necessary for psychic seduction. To seduce the minds of others, you will tap your energy centers for power and infuse your thoughts with this energy. Once infused, you can control others very easily and invoke primal emotions. Psychic Thought Tracers ™ Remote Psychic Seduction. Picture yourself influencing the mind of a beautiful target from the comfort of your home—without the arduous sexual visualizing required in the previous sections of this book. Psychic Thought Tracers ™ are globes of energy which you release into the atmosphere to carry out your seduction work. These are “tracers” because they hunt down your quarry and infuse them with thoughts of warmth, attraction... and yes, lust, for you. Creating a Psychic Thought Tracer requires about a week of practice, but the effort pays off in spades. Here’s the method: 1. Stand straight up and access your altered state using the method previously discussed. 2. Hold your hands out before you, both facing each other at a distance of six inches. Pretend you are holding a small basketball. 3. At the center of both palms are minor chakras—small glowing balls of energy. You must activate these chakras. To do so, visualize them rotating counterclockwise. After five rotations, mentally tear them open. Feel a strong tearing sensation, like you ripped open the energy balls on both hand. Your hand will throb and turn red. Feel the chakras gush forth golden energy in a stream. Project the gush between your hands, forming an iridescent globe of psychic energy. Allow the ball to grow and become dense. At a certain point you will feel resistance and the flow will ebb. The ball had become saturated and is primed for release. 4. A greater energy source exists in the chakra which floats 7 inches above your head. Tap this energy. Imagine a globe of silver energy floating above you. Feel its warmth, then forcefully tear it open with mental force. As it rips, feel energy cascade down to your crown and"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"17 ignite the crown chakra that sits there. As it ignites, imagine the energy coarse downwards to you third eye chakra and light it up as well. The energy then surges on to the heart and ignites the heart chakra . The heart chakra opens and floods energy which spills down your palms and into the ball that is already growing. 5. You must link the energy ball with the intent or purpose. To facilitate the linkage, you can name the energy globe. It must be a unique name that may have strong meaning for you. Call it by name then command THREE times (the number three holds mystical and psychic properties. It is said that calling your guardian angel three times invokes your spirit guide) in a simple statement of your wish. Say, “Markus, I will you to make Lisa fall deeply in love with me!” Voice out the command in sure, certain tones. Speak with power. Infuse the Globe with intent, then close your eyes and release your named globe into the atmosphere towards your target. As you release the globe, fill yourself with expectation that the object of your desire will be infused with the ball. 6. Send out energy globes throughout the day to increase the effect. Experimentation has shown that three balls are enough to change a woman’s (or man’s) perception towards you. You can invoke a range of emotions from your quarry, depending on your command. But the most effective commands are those which demand intense emotions, such as love, fear or desire. The Ultimate Seduction ™ I’ve saved the best for last. The Ultimate Seduction is for those who crave to see instant response and who disdain remote influence. The Ultimate Seduction is a favorite of many simply because of its effectiveness. You can see results immediately after applying it. But because of its power, this technique takes the longest to master because of the great visualization required. Ultimate Seduction unifies all the previous methods. Here’s how to induce irresistible desire in the minds of your target: 1. Once again, fire the altered states anchor while you can see the woman (or man) of your dreams. 2. Silently declare to yourself, “Girls, come to ME. I attract girls!” This is your new anchor that will allow you to recreate the state you will be inducing at this point forward. 3. Gaze at the woman and fill your mind with nothing but loving thoughts. Think “I want to love you”, “I want to give you my all.”, “I want to do the best I can for you.” If you can, imagine these thoughts as pink balls floating towards your target. This is known as the softener , and it creates psychic rapport between you because all negative barriers go down in the onslaught of loving thoughts. Pink is also known as the universal energy solvent which can penetrate all energy defenses that someone may have set up against you. 4. Occasionally drop your gaze downwards... a flirtatious tactic that can invoke curious thoughts in your quarry. After a while, make darting glances, while sending out more loving thoughts when you can."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"18 5. Approach your quarry a little bit. Mention again, “Girls come to me! I attract girls!” and as you approach, throw out beams of energy from your chest, palms and eyes towards hers. Infuse the energy you send towards her with your intentions. Your desires. Your emotions. Feel a tremendous attraction between you. 6. As you edge close, imagine the magnetic pull getting stronger... like a real lodestone drawing an iron bar. The sensation must be tangible. The mind thinks in pictures and by creating these sensations and throwing out the seductive thoughts, you are creating irresistible thoughts in the mind of your quarry. 7. Feel the woman tugging back as you tug at her. Increase the glowing tendrils of force. 8. When you intuitively sense the moment of saturation, project a final burst of pink energy from your chest to hers. You are charging her heart chakra with your personal energy. 9. Open a conversation while maintaining a steady gaze. You WILL notice a deep flush, nervousness and perhaps... a glint of attraction in her eye. Aura Meld ™ The greatest source of energy is the earth’s core. Within the earth seethes a mass of primordial energy which you can use to enhance your aura and generate sensations of warmth around you. The Aura Meld allows you to expand your aura and use it to enshroud others with your personal energy, thereby making them sympathetic (and loving) towards you. The technique is simple. 1. Stand straight and close your eyes. Part your legs shoulder width, arms at the sides. Become aware of the polar core at the earth’s center. As your awareness intensifies, you will become aware of the tips of your fingers and the bottoms of your feet start to tingle. 2. When the tingling sensation begins, imagine the core opening a vast conduit of energy and flooding you with vibrant green and purple hues. The energy surges upwards through your feet and body, onto your crown. Very soon, your body will vibrate. 3. Allow the energy flow to continue as you imagine the sun itself to radiate silver and yellow rays from above . The energy courses down and co-mingles with the flow from the earth. You sit in a powerful maelstrom of colors which go in both directions. The reverse polarities infuse your aura with energy and expands it by 7 feet. Feel it and see it expand 7 feet in radius around you. 4. Command the energies around you to solidify in a permanent whirling cylinder of rainbow colors. There are two surfaces to the cylinder. The inner surface revolves counter- clockwise. The external surface revolves in a clockwise direction. Command the energies. Give it a name and will it along these lines, “I will you, Amon Ra, to enshroud me with love, protection and guidance. ” It is important you voice the intent THREE times and with utmost expectation. Open your eyes and imagine a sudden explosion of power emanating from you outwards. 5. Feel calm and peace. As you enter the real world, walk with expectation that people WILL gravitate towards you."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"19 Note: The energy eventually leaks out. The maximum length of time you can expect the aura to surround you with your command of allure and seduction is about 12 hours. After that, you must re-energize. There are additional benefits to the Aura Meld. • Psychic attacks against you will fail and bounce back to the originator. • Your immune system shoots up. • People will feel tremendous energy and upliftment near you. • You radiate tremendous chi which make your thoughts more powerful. Your intuition goes off the scale and your will creates reality with greater ease. Advanced Psychic Seduction Addendum Hyper Mental Techniques for Seduction The Remote Viewing Seduction ™ The transference of the mind into another body is possible in very relaxed states. There is a science behind this, and it is called remote viewing. Remote viewing had been used extensively by Russian scientists to locate missing persons, dredge up nuclear subs and identify missile silos. The development of this advanced psychic technology had received tremendous attention because of the potential economic and military gains. Remote viewing, once mastered, easily endows individuals with unsurpassed powers. Imagine, you could physically see secrets transpiring behind locked rooms and events going on in opposite ends of the globe! Remote viewing empowers you to temporarily transfer your consciousness to another place, preferably in another body, in order to remotely access sights, sounds and sensations. For purposes of seduction, this book adapts remote viewing strategies to influence the thoughts of your target, without being physically present. Whether he or she is in the next room or in the next continent, your influence will be strongly felt. Of all the tactics in this book, this strategy allows you to experience the emotions that your target may be feeling at the moment. The methodology comprises of simple steps that require minimum effort to master. Practice the steps at least eight times to ensure that your brain gets used to the sensations. 1. Lie down perfectly still with your arms at your sides and your legs uncrossed. You must access the theta state either through the Corrector Method or the Color Entrainment technique. 2. When all outside sounds appear to have faded away, you will first picture in your mind’s internal field of vision the entire body of your target. See him or her in full three dimension. As you gaze at the body, create a globe of purple energy (it is an extremely"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"20 spiritual vibration) which enshrouds both of you. Allow the energy to permeate both of your bodies and cause both of you to vibrate at the same frequency. See her expression of calm and peace. 3. Start to recreate her surroundings imagine a physical environment around both of you. The accuracy need not coincide with her reality. 4. Force your consciousness out of your imagined body and into your target’s. You are now in her, looking out from your eyes. See your body from her eyes. See your surroundings from her body. Feel that you are now HER. If the link is strong, your imagined surroundings will disappear and reappear, forming the actual surroundings where she is currently at. Wait a minute and try to access your emotions and feelings that you know to be hers. You must attempt to get into synch with her true reality. You will find yourself bombarded with different alien sensations. 5. Once you feel that you are truly her, gaze at YOUR body which you left behind. Look at it, and imagine yourself falling in love with your image. Feel yourself yearning and desiring for your body. Walk over to your body in her body and hug yourself. Feel a rush of intense emotions. Automatically, you will create strong feelings of desire in the real person... strong desires for YOU! 6. You can remain in this created reality for about 20 to 30 minutes, but no longer because your target’s mind will begin to resist your influence. Depart immediately to waking state when you feel that you have created a very strong connection. Psychic Handshake ™ There is a tantric secret used by masters of seduction to psychically seduce others through a mere handshake! Before you go out into the world, open your hand and stare at your palm. Rub your palm until it turns red. Now visualize the glowing ball of energy in your palm. This is your palm chakra. Imagine it whirling counterclockwise and spewing out rivulets of light. You can wait for 2 minutes, then mentally TEAR it open. Feel a crackling and tearing sensation. You have activated your chakra. Imagine red and pink ribbons of energy streaming into your chakra. Your hand will actually throb and turn very red. If it doesn’t, something must be very wrong with you. Allow energy to continuously surge into your hand. As you do so, imagine the energy to be very sexual, very virile. If you wish, you can imagine the energy streaming from hundreds of thousands of vaginas and penises around the world. Your hand transforms into a sexual magnet. Eventually, the energy flow will ebb and your hand will refuse to absorb anymore. At that point, gaze intently at your hand and command it to draw desire from whomever it touches. In your mind, energize a picture of women (or men) falling in love with you the moment they shake your hand. When you feel that you have sufficiently created the thoughtform, raise your hand to the sky and picture blue cylinders of light flooding in and locking in your command and your energies in your palm. The blue light prevents extreme energy leaks and allows your hand to remain “seductive” for about six hours. Take your hand to war. When you shake hands, feel and imagine your prospect writhing in"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"21 sexual pleasure. You must KNOW inside that they feel great attraction towards you. Feel confident that desire ignites with even the slightest touch. Whenever you do this, your palm automatically recreates a sexual energy field and incites arousal within the other person. Magick Candle Spell Candles properly charged with psychic energy can weave spells of attraction. There is a simple spell you can use to generate bursts of desire. The effects are not very long lasting; nevertheless, you can use it for your own entertainment. The procedure calls for a simple pink candle, a little bit of kerosene and a lighter. Hold the candle to your forehead and imagine your body absorbing tremendous red-tinged energy from the earth. Feel the energy flood up your legs, torso, arms and head. As you do so, channel the energy into the candle. Compel yourself to believe that the candle is your prospect’s vagina (if she is a girl) or his penis (if he is a guy). You are infusing the candle with a psychic link. Start to imagine that the candle acquires human qualities of softness and fleshy sensations. Grasp the candle tightly and believe within yourself that it has wholly and totally transformed into her genitals. You must KNOW it is her genitals. Open your eyes and reverently breathe upon the candle, sprinkle its wick with kerosene. Close your eyes again and KNOW that you are about to cause your prospect to explode into orgasm. Open your eyes and light the candle. As the wick flares up, picture your prospect throb in excitement for just 3 seconds, then BANISH all thoughts from your mind. Throw away the candle and think no more of the session. You have released tremendous energy which cause her to get strongly attracted to you. Now is the perfect time to reach the telephone. Pentagram Spell ™ Creating reality from thoughts can be a tall order, but if you infuse enough ki energy into it, it will happen. There is a technique, called the Pentagram Spell that draws on tremendous amounts of chi over a span of 1 month, and if done right, it will grant you a wish. You will discover the success rate of this system to exceed your expectations. Pentagram Spell - To create reality from thought, using energy First know exactly WHAT you want. Create a *sentence of desire*, a very specific sentence of your wish detailing who, what, where, when, and why. *For instance, \"I wish for $1M, tax free, delivered TO ME with no strings attached on May 15,2001\"* That is your wish, and now, we will translate that into symbols that will draw contiuous (ki/chi/pranic) energy for one month. Remember, without energy, nothing can occur. Your car can’t run. The oven won’t burn. Your magick will not work. You will now get a large piece of paper and draw a 5 pointed star on it. At the top of the star draw a symbol for \"I\". The top of the star symbolizes WHO gets the wish. It can also symbolize who or what is the target of your magic influence."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"22 Go clockwise. At the next point is the \"what\" section.\" What exactly are you wishing for. Since you are wishing for $1M tax free, you can draw a dollar bill with broken chains to symbolize money with no catches. In psionic language, the “what” section is the trend, or the instruction given to a spell. This is what you want to happen! At the the next point, is the \"where\" section. Draw a symbol of your house because you want the money delivered to your home. The where section dictates where the ki energy should create the reality you desire. At the next point is the \"when\" section. Draw a calendar with the exact date when you want the event to occur. The when section is important because your energies will gather force to manifest your wish on this exact date. At the last point of the star, is the “WHY\" section. In symbols, write WHY you think you are deserving of this wish. You can reason that this wish will help you be of better service to your fellow man. In that case, draw a pillar supporting the world. Remember that entities other than ourselves exists. There are angels, demons and spirits. Should one be passing by and desirous to assist you, your rationale for casting the spell will determine its decision to help you. Now that you have created your pentagram, stare at it and be fully aware of what each and every symbol mean. Post the drawing on a place that you will see everyday, very frequently. Now stare at it, and in full tones, repeat the statement of your desire three times, and as you do so, go over the symbols as you intone each word. After the third repetition, run out of the room and don't think of it any longer. Now, each day, as you pass by the drawing (the more frequent, the better), drink in the symbols with full intent and full meaning, understanding exactly what each one means. Each time you do this, you infuse your original intent with ki. This ki goes out into the world and acts to create reality out of your written thought. After about a month, you will pass by the paper and you may discover a great repulsion from the paper. That means, that the paper is fully infused with power and ready to be finally released. When you feel that moment has arrived, stand before your paper and intone three times again, your statement of desire, and as you do so, look at each symbol and know what they mean. After the third intonation, throw your arms in the air, yell loudly, and feel a great release of energy from the symbols and the drawing, surging into the environment and finally creating a reality out of your thoughts. At this point, the drawing will feel empty and devoid of energy. That is because all intent and ki had finally left and is now actively manipulating reality according to your plan. Burn up the drawing and wait in full expectation for the result on the exact day of your bidding. I've learned of this \"magic spell\" 10 years ago. I noticed a 100% effectiveness, from accelerating the growth of plants to fixing damaged friendships (for others), to healing diseaes, to creating attraction and receiving small, but tidy sums of income. Cosmic Force Charging A professional psychic, David St. Claire came across a simple technique of tapping into the Cosmic Forces in order to unleash great quantities of energy in order to effect a change in the environment. The Cosmic Force goes by many appellations. Christians call Him God. Buddhists call him Buddha. Scientists call him Intelligent Energy. To maintain religious neutrality, let us"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"23 refer to the universal over-mind as the Cosmic Force. Atheists can disregard this section, but to their great disadvantage. From my field testing, this is the one technique that delivers results constantly. Religious people normally communicate with God via prayer and if done right, prayers tend to be answered. There are many ways of wording your requests and heaping praises upon the Cosmic Force, but have you noticed that some people have their prayers answered more often than not? They have intuitively discovered the right manner of making requests. There is a special technique of beseeching the Cosmic Force to have a petition granted. You will discover how easy it is to transform your life with just this technique alone. Once you apply this system to enrich your life, you will realize how indispensable it is for your day to day existence. Take note, however: the Cosmic Force technique cannot be used for iniquities. I recommend that your purposes be pure, and that you are deserving of your request. Do not expect the Cosmic Force to violate his own natural laws. It would be analogous to requesting God to worship other gods. Memorize now, the following phrase: I call upon the Cosmic Force (or God), and bring him into my being, requesting for strength, protection and guidance. This is the magic phrase you have to use to tune into the frequency and energies of the Cosmic Force. Knowing this phrase is the first step to aligning yourself into the frequencies of the universal intelligence. Now to the salient parts: Stand straight, with feet shoulder width apart and your hands raised in supplication to the heavens. Close your eyes. Breathe in deeply and slowly ten times. At the tenth breath, inhale, and say, “I call upon the Cosmic Force, and bring him into my being” then pause, exhale, then proclaim, “ and request for strength, protection and guidance.” Throughout your proclamation, be very aware of the meanings of each word. You must realize the implications of the words strength, protection and guidance. If you merely gloss over the magic phrase mindlessly, the system will not work. You will repeat the statement two more times, breathing as you do so. At the third statement, you will experience something out of the ordinary. Electricity may have coursed down your spine. The earth may seem to shudder. Warmth or cold may have spread over your body. There is a reason for this. By standing up, breathing, lowering your brain wave and proclaiming the magic phrase, you have naturally plugged yourself into the God-energies and gotten in synch . David St. Clair likens it to tuning into a radio station at a specific megahertz rating. Once you have aligned yourself with these higher energies, transmitting your needs to the Cosmic Force becomes easy. An important point: it is not the magic phrase itself, but the thought and meaning behind the magic phrase that creates the link with Cosmic Force. Hence, great importance must be attached to the meaning. Feel and release the meaning of the magic phrase as you loudly proclaim it. Creating the link with the Cosmic Force is the first half of the session. The second half is the part which may concern you the most: the petitions. In the stillness of your mind, request from the Cosmic Force exactly what you desire, where you need it, when you want it and why you are"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"24 deserving of it. These elements are vital. As you speak, do so humbly and with a tone that you would use when conversing with an old friend. Avoid high faluting words and fancy appellations. As you make your petition, feel that your wish had already been granted. From there, you can terminate the session by thanking the Cosmic Force for past granted wishes. Cross your arms across your chest, as you see mummies do. According to David St. Claire, this releases the pent up energy. Open your eyes. Your desire WILL be granted if you executed the technique to the letter, and bore a strong positive expectation. Cosmic Telepathy Telepathy, thought transference and emotional transmissions can be boosted by 100% with the Cosmic Force technique. Again, I urge you against any unethical deployment of this technique. Do NOT use this system to seduce others into something against their will. It may backfire. Cosmic-charged telepathy demands very little effort and yields surprising results! For purposes of illustration, assume that you desire Ms. Clarissa Wakefield to give you a date (This is a morally neutral request, and therefore permissible). Call the Cosmic Force into yourself with the previous method. Petition the Cosmic Force for intervention. You could request Him for a chance to meet your dream lady and that she receive you warmly. Make the request as detailed and fervent as possible. Mingle your emotions with positive expectations that your desire will be granted. You have completed the first step. The next requires a bit of visualization. With your eyes are still closed, breathe in deeply three times. As you do so, feel the rush of energy of the Cosmic Force infusing your being. Your body may begin violent shuddering, as though ice were pouring down your spine. You have powered up with an unlimited energy reservoir. Now see the person before you. Put in as much three dimensional detail as you can. Perhaps, you can see her seated, in familiar surroundings. Now with your psychic hands, hold her head and see your thumbs lightly touch her forehead, preferably her third eye. Look deeply into her eyes and tell her, “Clarissa Wakefield, this is (state your name). I have been thinking of you and I really want to meet you. Please go out with me. I’d love us to have fun together. You’d enjoy my company. We’d have fun together” Repeat your message numerous times, full of emotion, steeped with intent. Don’t forget to mention your name in the beginning, as well as hers. This is to ensure that messages will not be mistaken. While broadcasting your message, feel all the pent up energy cascading down your arms, to your hand, in into her head. The ki energy and cosmic energy that you send into your hallucination mingles with your real thoughts and cascades through space into the person you are actually trying to influence. These energies boost the telepathic thought 100% and guarantee that your message gets through, whatever she may be doing at the moment. After some minutes, you will feel a repulsion of energy and a little voice will tell you that you’ve gotten through. At that point you can stop broadcasting. Thank the Cosmic Force, cross your arms, open your eyes, and expect a phone call."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"25 The Telepathic Cosmic Force technique is highly effective in other types of situations. Whether you seek a raise from your boss, you want your lover to be faithful or you wish to scare away an enemy, you simply have to word your emotionally charged message and send it off. If you can feel and see the message that you send, all the more powerful will be your transmission. Don’t expect the telepathic transfer to be successful if you are sending messages that cannot be felt emotionally or seen visually. If you try to send, “The answer is 238912 times 3341 plus the square root of 8121” to your girlfriend who is taking an exam, you will be disappointed. There isn’t enough emotional and visual material that your mind can use to send this type of message. I have attempted this technique over vast distances to convey snippets of emotions. The technique had never failed me yet. Advanced Organ Heating™ This technique leverages the power of the two chakras, or power centers in your palms. Even though your target may not be before you, you will learn to unleash tremendous amounts of energy at his or her sexual organs and effect arousal. Hold our your hands before you, palms facing together. As with the previous techniques, activate the two chakras by letting them whirl a bit and then mentally tearing them open. Will your palms to begin sucking in light and warmth around it. Allow five minutes of charging. Your palms should be burning red and throbbing. Try to test that you have enough energy already. Chose one of your thighs. Place one palm on the left side of your thigh, and the other on the right side. Your thigh is now sandwiched between both palms (but don’t let your palms touch your thighs!). Release the energy into your thighs. Essentially, you are double charging your thigh. As you pour on the energy, your thighs shall begin to quiver and heat up because of the opposite polarities of energy that comes from two directions. If your thighs heat up, that means you’ve done the previous steps perfectly. You can begin seduction. Charge up your palms again for five minutes, then close your eyes. Now imagine that your target is standing before you, naked. You are facing her from her side, not her front. That means that you can see her shoulders, the side of her head and the side of her body. Now place one hand in front of her genitals, and one hand behind her genitals. Her genitals, like your thigh, are sandwiched between your palms. Release the energy and see red, glowing light pour into her. As you do so, see the genitals heat up and acquire a glow. The genitals should throb visibly. See wetness. Within ten minutes, your energy will be totally released and she will be sufficiently aroused or attracted to you. Her thoughts will be bombarded with warm images of you. This is the perfect time to start a conversation. Give her a ring.

Knell proposes the following amendment: Instead of using the hand to heat the target organ, link awareness of the third eye (the energy center directly between the physical eyes with the prospect’s clit. Close the eyes and imagine them to be pools of red water. Allow the eyes to flood the clit with a rush of heated red water. In time, the prospect’s physical clitoris will respond to the flood of energy and realize an arousal towards the operator. Knell can be contacted at knellyoung@hotmail.com Tim Gula’s Pitch Fork Method Tim modified the Corrector method to rapidly access theta states. Attempts to cool down the corrector can be accomplished by envisioning a pitch fork embedded through the skull with a large, cold ice cube at the end. The imagery facilitates rapid constriction of blood vessels in the area, thereby lowering the brain temperature. Intense vibration of the body may be expected. Tim can be contacted at TimGula@aol.com Angel’s Phone Number You can EASILY transmit your desire to be called by your prospect! Angel discovered that after accessing a very relaxed state, and conjuring a realistic 3D image of your target, you simply lean over to the ear of her ghost and whisper insistently that you wish to be called at your home number. If you do so with full intent and confidence, your prospect will return your call! Angel can be contacted at angelwings21@msn.com Massimo’s Clitoral Method Massimo Tira mixed some principles of the Knell Young's Eye Method with the standard Organ Heating Techinique. Reasoning that the clitoris is easier to stimulate because is not as large an organ as the whole groin area (as Knell suggested), Massimo proposed that psychic organ heating can be accomplished much more rapidly by concentrating on a mental link created between the clit and the finger tip. The following are his suggestions: 1. Imagine the tip of the index finger as the girl's clitoris and then concentrate on it to make it warmer. As with the Organ Heating Method, you simply have to visualize heat surging into the index finger. 2. The index finger tip will eventually become hot and throbbing. Simultaneously, the clitoris linked mentally to the finger tip will have been infused with blood. Ninja then suggests tickling the finger with the fingers of the other hands, physically while concentrating on the aware ness of the tip being the clitoris. The clitoris would be pulsating strongly at this point. 3. To consummate the session and intensify the psychic transfer of energy, the seducer can begin to suck the tip of the clitoris/finger (He proposes doing this physically, but you can hallucinate it, if you prefer not to suck your finger)and at the same time, visualize the face of the girl getting excited and approaching satisfaction. The process can be aided by"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"27 transforming the hallucination into a total experience of sight/sound/tactile sensations. The more real the hallucination, the greater the remote influence. 4. The tactic can be used on men as well, with concentration on the head instead. 5. As with the previous techniques, the psychic rapport will be established most strongly if the seducer maintains a low brainwave state at the alpha level: the implication is that you must not arouse yourself. Instead, approach the session clinically as a doctor would. Massimo can be contacted at ninja@nightmail.com Even More Techniques! More of their techniques can be found in the archives of UltimateSeduction@egroups.com Epilogue Psychic Seduction™ was designed to deliver maximum impact only with continuous practice. As a babe cannot run the moment it was born, so can not expect to produce results in as short as a week. Give yourself time. One month should be enough to boost your capacity to effect almost instantaneous attraction. Work at it. By this point, you may have wondered at the numerous images of sex and steamy sensuality throughout the manual. Even though you bombard your prospect’s mind with such thoughts, she (he) will not really see those pictures as you sent them. The Psychic Seduction System requires those vivid images simply to create the necessary mental and psychic thought links. What happens when you apply all the techniques in this book is to create a very favorable and attractive impression of yourself in her (his) mind. She will perceive you to be very sexy and charismatic. This is because you have mentally stroked her psychic passion centers. Other than that, do not expect her to actually see the sexy images that you transmit. A user of the Psychic Seduction III system claims that he got his wife to stay in one room and he stayed in the other. Applying the Thought Tracers and Advanced Organ Heating (I provided him with this technique prior to the release of Psychic Seduction IV), he got her to climax remotely! He then asked her what sensations and images she experienced. Her reply was not surprising. She felt herself getting very aroused as blood rushed to her sexual organs. Her mind flashed fleeting images of her husband and she felt strongly attracted to him. Involuntarily, she did climax without self-stimulation, in much the same way that males experience nocturnal emissions. When asked if she saw any sexual images, she replied that she didn’t. She just felt an increasing excitement and she vaguely felt that her arousal was connected to thoughts of her husband. She even felt as though her husband were near her! Sources Psychic Seduction The body of this work draws from documented records of mind control which was practiced in German hamlets in the early 1200’s. At the time of religious upheaval, and in the subsequent industrial age, much of this knowledge had been lost. History witnessed its rising again in the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"28 1800s, this time in Russia. While unverified, an account elaborates a tale of monks carrying with them forbidden books on the hidden arts, scientific inventions, orgone technology and a specialized system of agriculture. These books were sold to a Dr. Trotsky for fund raising purposes. Organ Heating Method I and II The OHM was discovered by accident. The author played around with pranic healing in the past and stumbled across the positive correlation between associating body parts with external objects. Once a mind association is made between personal body parts and foreign bodies, all it takes is concentrated will to effect psychic manipulation. Advanced Psychic Seduction The Author developed Advanced Psychic Seduction with help from the following tomes. • Rigorous thought experimentation projects (the way Einstein conducted his science experiments) • The Unseen World, by Barbara Stabiner • Iron Shirt Chi Kung by Mantak Chia • Witchcraft, Wicca and The Other Side by Leonor Constance. • David St. Claire’s Lessons in Instant ESP by David St. Claire • Scott Smith (ss1atlanta@yahoo.com) provided invaluable insight into Psychic Tracers. Apparently, he sourced material from The Mindlist which is run by JC Claudio. You can access extremely powerful material at jcclaudio.com • Various NLP and behavioral resources. Aura Meld The last technique is a personal method devised by the author in his High School days when Wicca was his burning hobby.
