To objectively ascertain the following, one may nee d to re-examine preconceived ideologies relating to the dualistic nature of mank ind. Resolving the philosophical question of whether we are inherently good or inherently evil is tantamount in shaping our percep tion of reality; specifically, the spiritual variable within the equation of life. This exposition is substantiated by declassified U. S. government documents, individuals formerly connected to the U.S. intellig ence communities, historical writings, researchers knowledgeable in mind control , publications from mental health practitioners, and interviews taken from sur vivors unwittingly subjected to a highly complex form of trauma-based mind control kn own as MONARCH programming. A word of caution for survivors of intensively syst ematic mind control and/or some form of ritualized abuse: There are numerous “trigg ers” in this article. It is therefore recommended not to read it unless appropr iate support systems are in place or if you have a thoroughly reintegrated pers onality A Brief History of Control The Mystery Religions of ancient Egypt, Greece, Ind ia and Babylon helped lay the foundation for occultism, meaning “hidden knowledge .” One of the earliest writings giving reference to occultism is the Egypt ian Book of the Dead, a compilation of rituals explicitly describing method s of torture and intimidation (to create trauma), the use of potions (drugs) and the casting of spells (hypnotism), ultimately resulting in the total enslavement of th e initiate.[1] These have been the main ingredients for a part of occultism known as Satanism, throughout the ages. During the 13th Century, the Roman Catholic chu rch increased and solidified its dominion throughout Europe with the infamous In quisition. Satanism survived this period of persecution, deeply entrenching itse lf under the veil of various esoteric groups."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In 1776, a Bavarian Jesuit by the name of Adam Wei shaupt was commissioned by the House of Rothschild to centralize the power bas e of the Mystery Religions into what is commonly known as the Illuminati, meaning “ Enlightened Ones.” This was an amalgamation of powerful occultic bloodlines, el ite secret societies and influential Masonic fraternities, with the desire t o construct the framework for a “New World Order.” The outward goal of this Utopia was to bring forth universal happiness to the human race. However, their underly ing intention was to gradually increase control over the masses, thus becoming mas ters of the planet. The Anglo Alliance By the 19th century, Great Britain and Germany were recognized as the primary geographic areas of Illuminati control. It then sho uld be of little surprise to know the first work in Behavioral Science research was e stablished in England in 1882, while much of the early medical and psychiatric tec hniques involved in mind control were pioneered at the Kaiser Wilhelm Instit ute in Germany. The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations was set up in London i n 1921 to study the “breaking point” of humans. Kurt Lewin, a German psychologist , became the director of the Tavistock Institute in 1932, about the same time Na zi Germany was increasing its research into neuropsychology, parapsychology and m ulti-generational occultism. Interestingly, a progressive exchange of scientific ideas was taking place between England and Germany, most notably in the field of e ugenics: the movement devoted to “improving” the human species through th e control of hereditary factors in mating. The nefariously enigmatic union between the two countries was bonded, partly through the Order of the Golden Dawn , a secret society which consisted of many high ranking officials in the Naz i party and British aristocracy. Top SS Nazi officer Heinrich Himmler, was in charge of a scientific project called Lebersborn, which included selective breeding and a doption of children, a peculiarly large number of twins among them.[2] The purpose of the program was to create a super-race (Aryans) who would have tota l allegiance to the cause of the Third Reich(New World Order). Much of the preliminary experimentation concerning genetic engineering and behavior modification was conducted by Dr. Josef Me ngele at Auschwitz, where he coldly analyzed the effects of trauma-bonding, eye- coloring and “twinning” upon his victims. Beside the insidious surgical experim entation performed at the concentration camp, some of the children were subje cted to massive amounts of electroshock. Sadly, many of them did not survive t he brutality. Concurrently, “brain-washing” was carried out on inm ates at Dachau, who were placed under hypnosis and given the hallucinogenic drug mescaline. During the war, parallel behavioral research was led by Dr. Ge orge Estabrooks of Colgate University. His involvement with the Army, CID, FBI and other agencies remains shrouded in secrecy. However, Estabrooks would occ asionally “slip” and discuss his work involving the creation of hypno-programmed cou riers and hypnotically- induced split personalities.[3] After WWII, the U.S. Department of Defense secretly imported many of the top German Nazi and Italian Fascist scientists and spie s into the United States via South America and the Vatican. The code name for this ope ration was Project PAPERCLIP.[4] One of the more prominent finds for th e U.S. was German General Reinhard Gehlen. Hitler’s Chief of Intelligence agai nst Russia. Upon arriving in Washington D.C. in 1945, Gehlen met extensively with President Truman, General William “Wild Bill” Donovan, Director of the Office of Strategic Services(OSS) and"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Allen Dulles, who would later become the stalwart h ead of the CIA. The objective of their brain-storming sessions was to reorganize the nominal American intelligence operation, transforming it into a high ly-efficient covert organization. The culmination of their efforts produced the Centra l Intelligence Group in 1946, renamed the Central Intelligence Agency(CIA) in 1947 . Reinhard Gehlen also had profound influence in help ing to create the National Security Council, from which the National Security A ct of 1947 was derived. This particular piece of legislation was implemented to protect an unconscionable number of illegal government activities, including clandestine mind control programs. The Evolution of Project MKULTRA With the CIA and National Security Council firmly est ablished, the first in a series of covert brain-washing programs was initiated by t he Navy in the fall of 1947. Project CHATTER was developed in response to the Sov iet’s “successes” through the use of “truth drugs.” This rationale, however w as simply a cover story if the program were to be exposed. The research focused on the identification and testing of such drugs for use in interrogations and the recruitment of agents.[5] The project was officially terminated in 1953. The CIA decided to expand their efforts in the area of behavior modification, with the advent of Project BLUEBIRD, approved by directo r Allen Dulles in 1950. Its objectives were to; (1) discover a means of conditi oning personnel to prevent unauthorized extraction of information from them by known means, (2) investigate the possibility of control of an individual by appl ication of special interrogation techniques, (3) investigate memory enhancement and (4) establish defensive means for preventing hostile control of agency pers onnel. In August 1951, Project BLUE BIRD was renamed Project ARTICHOKE, which evalu ated offensive uses of interrogation techniques, including hypnosis and dr ugs The program ceased in 1956. Three years prior to the halt of Project ART ICHOKE, Project MKULTRA came into existence on April 13, 1953 along the lines pr oposed by Richard Helms, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (DDCI) with the rati onale of establishing a “special funding mechanism of extreme sensitivity.”[6] The hypothetical etymology of “MK” may possibly sta nd for “Mind Kontrolle.” The obvious translation of the German word “Kontrolle” into English is “control.”[7] A host of German doctors, procured from the post war Nazi talent pool, were an invaluable asset toward the development of MKULTRA. The correlation between the concentration camp experiments and the numerous sub-projects of MKULTRA are clearly evident. The various avenues used to co ntrol human behavior under MKULTRA included radiation, electroshock, psycholog y, psychiatry, sociology, anthropology, graphology, harassment substances and paramilitary devices and materials “LSD” being the most widely dispensed “ma terial”. A special procedure, designated MKDELTA, was established to govern the u se of MKULTRA abroad. MKULTRA/DELTA materials were used for harassment, d iscrediting or disabling purposes.[8] Of the 149 subprojects under the umbre lla of MKULTRA having been identified, Project MONARCH, officially begun by the U.S. Army in the early 1960’s (although unofficially implemented much earlier) ap pears to be the most prominent and is still classified as TOP SECRET for “National Security” reasons.[9] MONARCH may have culminated from MKSEARCH subprojects , such as operation SPELLBINDER, which was set up to create “sleeper” a ssassins (i e. “Manchurian candidates”) who could be activated upon receiving a key word or phrase while in a post-hypnotic trance. Operation OFTEN, a study whic h attempted to harness the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"power of occultic forces was possibly one of severa l cover programs to hide the insidious reality of Project MONARCH. Definition and Description The name MONARCH is not necessarily defined within t he context of royal nobility, but rather refers to the monarch butterfly. When a person is undergoing trauma induced by electroshock, a feeling of light-headedn ess is evidenced; as if one is floating or fluttering like a butterfly. There is a lso a symbolic representation pertaining to the transformation or metamorphosis o f this beautiful insect: from a caterpillar to a cocoon (dormancy, inactivity ), to a butterfly (new creation) which will return to its point of origin. Such is the mig ratory pattern that makes this species unique. Occultic symbolism may give additional insight into the true meaning Psyche is the word for both “soul” and “butterfly” coming from th e belief that human souls become butterflies while searching for a new reinca rnation. [10] Some ancient mystical groups, such as the Gnostics, saw the butterfly as a symbol of corrupt flesh. The “Angel of Death” (remember Me ngele?) in Gnostic art works was portrayed crushing the butterfly.[11] A marione tte is a puppet that is attached to strings and is controlled by the puppet master, hence MONARCH programming is also referred to as the “Marionette Syndrome.” “Imp erial Conditioning” is another term used, while some mental health therapists know it as “Conditioned Stimulus Response Sequences.” Project MONARCH could be best d escribed as a form of structured dissociation and occultic integration, i n order to compartmentalize the mind into multiple personalities within a systemati c framework. During this process, a Satanic ritual, usually including Cabalis tic mysticism, is performed with the purpose of attaching a particular demon or grou p of demons to the corresponding alter(s). Of course, most skeptics wo uld view this as simply a means to enhance trauma within the victim, negating any irrational belief that demonic possession actually occurs. Alters and Triggers Another way of examining this convoluted victimizat ion of body and soul is by looking at it as a complex computer program: A file (alter) is created through trauma, repetition and reinforcement. In order to a ctivate (trigger) the file, a specific access code or password (cue or command) i s required. The victim/survivor is called a “slave” by the programmer/handler, who in turn is perceived as “master” or “god.” About 75% are female, since they possess a higher tolerance for pain and tend to dissociate easier than males. Subj ects are used mainly for cover operations, prostitution and pornography; involveme nt in the entertainment industry is notable. A former military officer con nected to the DIA, told this writer, “In the ‘big picture’ these people [MONARCH victims] are in all walks of life, from the bum on the street to the white-colla r guy”. In corroboration, a retired CIA agent vaguely discussed the use of such personnel to be used as “plants” or “chameleons” for the purpose of infiltr ating a designated group, gathering information and/or injecting an ulterior agenda. There are an inordinate amount of alters in the vic tim/survivor with numerous back-up programs, mirrors and shadows. A division o f light-side (good) and dark- side (bad) alters are interwoven in the mind and ro tate on an axis. One of the main internal structures, (of which thei r are many) within the system is shaped like a double-helix, consisting of seven lev els. Each system has an internal"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"programmer which oversees the “gatekeeper” (demons? ) who grant or deny entry into the different rooms. A few of the internal ima ges predominately seen by victims/survivors are trees, the Cabalistic “Tree of Life,” with adjoining root systems, infinity loops, ancient symbols and letter s, spider webs, mirrors or glass shattering, masks, castles, mazes, demons/monsters/ aliens, sea shells, butterflies, snakes, ribbons, bows, flowers, hour glasses, clock s, robots, chain-of-command diagrams and/or schematics of computer circuitry bo ards. Bloodlines and Twinning A majority of the victims/survivors come from multi -generational Satanic families (bloodlines) and are ostensibly programmed “to fill their destiny as the chosen ones or chosen generations” (a term coined by Mengele at Auschwitz). Some are adopted out to families of similar origin. Others u sed in this neurological nightmare are deemed as the “expendable ones” (non-bloodliner s), usually coming from orphanages, foster care homes, or incestuous famili es with a long history of pedophilia. There also appears to be a pattern of f amily members affiliated with government or military intelligence agencies. Many of the abused come from families who use Cathol icism, Mormonism, or charismatic Christianity as a “front” for their abom inable activities (though members of other religious groups are also involved .) Victims/survivors generally respond more readily to a rigid religious (dogmatic, legalistic) hierarchical structure because it paral lels their base programming. Authority usually goes unchallenged, as their will has been usurped through subjective and command-oriented conditioning. Physical identification characteristics on victims/ survivors often include multiple electrical prod scars and/or resultant moles on the ir skin. A few may have had various parts of their bodies mutilated by knives, branding irons, or needles, Butterfly or occult tattoos are also common. Genera lly, bloodliners are less likely to have the subsequent markings, as their skin is t o “remain pure and unblemished.” The ultimate purpose of the sophisticated manipulat ion of these individuals may sound unrealistic, depending upon our interpretive understanding of the physical and spiritual realms. The deepest and darkest alter s within bloodliners are purported to be dormant until the “Anti-Christ’ is r evealed. These “New World Order” alters supposedly contain call-back orders a nd instructions to train and/or initiate a large influx of people (possibly clones or “soulless ones”), thereby stimulating social control programs into the new mi llennium. Non-biological “twinning” is yet another bizarre feature observed within MONARCH programming. For instance, two young non related children would be ceremoniously initiated in a magical “soul-bonding” ritual so they might be “ins eparably paired for eternity” (possibly another Mengele connection?). They essent ially share two halves of the programmed information, making them interdependent upon one another. Paranormal phenomenon such as astral projection, te lepathy, ESP, etc. appear to be more pronounced between those who have undergone this process. Levels of MONARCH Programming [12] ALPHA. Regarded as “general” or regular programming within the base control personality; characterized by extremely pronounced memory retention, along with"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"substantially increased physical strength and visua l acuity. Alpha programming is accomplished through deliberately subdividing the v ictims personality which, in essence, causes a left brain-right brain division, allowing for a programmed union of L and R through neuron pathway stimulation. BETA. Referred to as “sexual” programming. This pro gramming eliminates all learned moral convictions and stimulates the primit ive sexual instinct, devoid of inhibitions. “cat” alters may come out at this leve l. DELTA. This is known as “killer” programming, origi nally developed for training special agents or elite soldiers (i.e. Delta Force, First Earth Battalion, Mossad, etc.) in covert operations. Optimal adrenal output and co ntrolled aggression is evident. Subjects are devoid of fear; very systematic in car rying out their assignment. Self- destruct or suicide instructions are layered in at this level. THETA considered to the “psychic” programming. Blo odliners (those coming from multi-generational Satanic families) were determine d to exhibit a greater propensity for having telepathic abilities than did non-bloodliners. Due to its evident limitations, however, various forms of elec tronic mind control systems were developed and introduced, namely, bio-medical human telemetry devices (brain implants), directed-energy lasers using micr owaves and/or electromagnetics. It is reported these are used in conjunction with highly-advanced computers and sophisticated satellite tracking syst ems. OMEGA. A “self-destruct” form of programming, also known as “Code Green.” The corresponding behaviors include suicidal tendencies and/or self-mutilation. This program is generally activated when the victim/surv ivor begins therapy or interrogation and too much memory is being recovere d. GAMMA. Another form of system protection is through “deception” programming, which elicits misinformation and misdirection. This level is intertwined with demonology and tends to regenerate itself at a late r time if inappropriately deactivated. Method and Components The initial process begins with creating dissociati on within the subject, usually occurring from the time of birth to about six years . This is primarily achieved through the use of electroshock (ECT) and is at time s performed even when the child is in the mother’s womb. Due to the severe tr auma induced through ECT, sexual abuse and other methods, the mind splits off into alternate personalities from the core. Formerly referred to as Multiple Pe rsonality Disorder, it is presently recognized as Dissociative Identity Disorder and is the basis for MONARCH programming. Further conditioning of the victim’s m ind is enhanced through hypnotism, double-bind coercion, pleasure-pain reve rsals, food, water, sleep and sensory deprivation, along with various drugs which alter certain cerebral functions. The next stage is to embed and compress detailed co mmands or messages within the specified alter. This is achieved through the u se of hi-tech headsets, in conjunction with computer-driven generators which e mit inaudible sound waves or harmonics that affect the RNA covering of neuron pa thways to the subconscious and unconscious mind. “Virtual Reality” optical de vices are sometimes used simultaneously with the harmonic generators project ing pulsating colored lights,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"subliminals and split-screen visuals. High voltage electroshock is then used for memory dissolution. Programming is updated periodically and reinforced through visual, auditory and written mediums. Some of the first programming them es included the Wizard of Oz and Alice and Wonderland, both heavily saturated wi th occultic symbolism. Many of the recent Disney movies and cartoons are used in a two-fold manner: desensitizing the majority of the population, using subliminals a nd neuro-linguistic programming, and deliberately constructing specific triggers and keys for base programming of highly-impressionable MONARCH children. A prime example of how subliminal programming works is by looking at the recent Disney cinematic sensation Pochahontas, curiously b illed as their “33rd” (highest degree in Scottish Rite Freemasonry) animated movie . In the movie, Grandmother Willow is a mystical 400 year old tree who counsels the motherless Pochahontas to listen to her heart and help her realize all the an swers lie within. Grandmother Willow is constantly talking in “double-speak” and using “reversals” (i.e. “Sometimes the right path is not the easiest one”; the esoteric derivative being: the left path [the path that leads to destruction] is the easiest one. In Illuminati Structured MPD Systems, the willow tree represents the occultic powers of Druidism. The intrinsic imagery of the tree’s branc hes, leaves and root systems are very significant, as some of the dark spiritual pro per ties associated with the Willow Tree Programming are: (I) The branches are used to whip victims in ritual s for “cleansing” purposes, (2) A willow tree can endure severe weather disturbances (i.e. storms) and is known for it’s pliability or flexibility. Victims/Survivors of the programming describe the willow’s branches wrapping around them, with no hop e of escape, (3) The deep root system of the willow tree makes the victim/sur vivor feel as if they are falling deeper and deeper into an abyss while in a hypnotic trance. Music plays an instrumental role in programming, th rough combinations of variable tones, rhythms and words. Frightmeister Stephen Kin g’s numerous novels and subsequent movies, are purported by credible source s to be used for such villainous purposes. One of his latest books, Insomnia, featur es a picture of King with the trigger phrase “WE NEVER SLEEP,” (indicative of som eone with MPD/ DID) below an all-seeing eye. A partial list of other mediums us ed to reinforce base programming are: Pinnochio, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, E. T., Star Wars, Ghost Bus ters, Trancers II, Batman, Bewitched, Fantasy Island, Reboot, Tiny Toons, Duck Tails, The Dead Sea Scrolls and The Tall Book of Make Believe. A few movies wh ich depict or portray some aspect of MONARCH programming are Hell raiser 3, Rai sing Cain, Labyrinth, Telefon, Johnny Mneumonic, Point of No Return, The Lawnmower Man and Closet Land. Programmers and Places It’s difficult to figure out who the original progr ammer of this satanic project was, due to the substantial amount of disinformation and cross-contamination propagated by the “powers that be.” The two that we nt by the color-coded name of Dr. Green are a Jewish doctor named Dr. Gruenba um, who supposedly collaborated with the Nazis during WWII, and Dr. Jo sef Mengele, whose trademark of cold blooded and calculating brutality has not o nly scarred the souls of survivors"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"from Auschwitz, but also a countless number of vict ims throughout the world. Mengele’s direct involvement at the infamous Auschw itz concentration camp was suspiciously downplayed during the Nuremberg Trials , and consequently no intensified effort by the U.S. and it’s allies was directed toward his capture.[13] As a means to confuse serious investigators as to h is whereabouts, U.S. officials would report Mengele being a non-threatening, reclu se in Paraguay or Brazil, or that he was simply dead (the “Angel of Death” mirac ulously must have come back to life at least five different times). His unprecedented research, at the expense of thous ands of lives, undoubtedly was a significant bonus to U.S. interests, Besides usin g the pseudonym of Dr. Green, survivors knew him as Vaterchen (daddy), Schoner Jo sef (beautiful Joseph), David and Fairchild. A gracefully handsome man of slight stature, Mengele would disarm people with his gentle demeanor, while at other tim es, he would explode into violent rages.[14] Other characteristics remembered by survivors were the cadence of his shiny black boots as he paced back and forth and his I-love-you/l-love-you- not” daisy game. When he pulled off the last daisy petal, he would maliciously torture and kill a small child in front of the othe r child he was programming. Distraught survivors also recalled being thrown nak ed into cages with monkeys, who were trained to viciously abuse them. Evidentl y, Mengele enjoyed reducing people to the level of animals. He also would purpo sely restrain his victims from crying, screaming, or showing any excessive emotion . Dr. D. Ewen Cameron, also known as Dr. White, was th e former head of the Canadian, American and World Psychiatric Association s. Because of Cameron’s extensive experience and credentials, the ClA’s Alle n Dulles funneled millions of dollars throughout organizations like the society f or the Investigation of Human Ecology, which Cameron ruthlessly presided over. Exp erimentations were conducted at several locations in Montreal, mostly at McGill University, St Mary’s Hospital and Allan Memorial Institute. Besides the conventional methods of psychiatric tyr anny, such as electroshock drug injections and lobotomies, Cameron conceived the tec hnique of “psychic driving,” wherein unsuspecting patients were kept in a drug i nduced coma for several weeks and administered a regimen of electroshocks, while electronic helmets were strapped to their heads and repetitive auditory mes sages were transmitted at variable speeds.[15] Many of those exploited were abused children which had been run through the Roman Catholic orphanage system. Not surprisingly, Dr Cameron has been conveniently left out of most psychiatric journals. This may have been, in fact, largely due to Project MKULTRA being publicly expos ed in 1970, through lawsuits filed by Canadian survivors and their families. The CIA and Canadian government settled out of court so as not to be required to of ficially admit to any wrongdoing. A former U.S. Army Lt. Col. in the DIA’s Psychologic al Warfare Division, Michael Aquino, is the latest in a line of alleged governme nt-sponsored sadists. Aquino, an eccentric genius, founded the Temple of Set, an off shoot of Anton LaVey’s Church of Satan. His obsession with Nazi pagan rituals and his hypnotic manipulation of people made him an ideal candidate for the position of “Master Programmer.” Aquino was connected with the Presidio Army Base da y care scandal, in which he was accused child molestation. Much to the dismay of the young victims’ parents, all charges were dismissed.

The original “Dr. Black” was apparently Leo Wheeler, the nephew of deceased General Ear1e G. Wheeler, who was the comm ander of the Joint Chiefs of Staffs during the Vietnam War.

The names and locations of some of the major instit utions involved in MONARCH programming experimentation were/are: Cornell, Duke, Princeton, UCLA, University of Roches ter, MIT, Georgetown University Hospital, Maimonides Medical Center, St. Elizabeth’s Hospital (Washington D.C.), Bell Laboratories, Stanford Resea rch Institute, Westinghouse Friendship Laboratories, General Electric, ARCO and Manking Research Unlimited, The “final product” was/is usually created on milit ary installations and bases, where maximum security is required.

The book, The Control of Candy Jones, (Playboy Press) portrays her 12 years of intrigue a nd suspense as a spy for the CIA. Jones, whose birth name is Jessica Wilcox, apparent ly fit the physiological profile as to be one of the initial experiments or human gu inea pigs under the government’s “scientific” project, MKULTRA. The most publicized case of MONARCH monomania has su rfaced through the book TRANCE Formation of America: The True Life Story of a ClA Slave by Cathy O’Brien. On the back cover it emphatically states, “Cathy O’Brien is the only voca l and recovered survivor of the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Central Intelligence Agency’s MKULTRA Project Monarc h mind control operation” This documented autobiography contains compelling a ccounts of O’Brien’s years of unrelenting incest and eventual introduction into P roject MONARCH by her perverted father. Along with co-author Mark PhiIlip s, her rescuer and deprogrammer, Cathy covers an almost unbelievable ar ray of conspiratorial crime: forced prostitution (white slavery) with those in t he upper echelons of world politics, covert assignments as a “drug mule” and c ourier, and the country-western music industry’s relationship with illegal CIA activ ities. Paul Bonaci a courageous survivor who endured almos t two decades of degradation under Project MONARCH, has disclosed strong corrobor ating evidence of widescale crimes and corruption from the municipal/state leve l all the way up to the White House.[17] He has testified about sexually-abused m ales selected from Boy’s Town in Nebraska and taken to nearby Offut AFB, where he says they were subjected to intense MONARCH programming, directed mainly by Comma nder Bill Plemmons and former Lt. Col. Michael Aquino.[18] After thoroughly tormenting the young boys into mindless oblivion, they were used (along with girls) for pornography and prostitution with several of the nation’s political and economic power brokers. Bonnaci recalled being transported from the Air For ce base via cargo planes to McClelland AFB in California. Along with other unfort unate adolescents and teenagers, he was driven to the elite retreat, Bohe mian Grove. The perpetrators took full advantage of these innocent victims, comm itting unthinkable perversions in order to satisfy their deviant lusts. Some victi ms were apparently murdered, further traumatizing already terrified and broken c hildren. An unsuitable actress of marginal talent (now deceased), a morally-corrup t T.V. evangelist, a heralded former Green Beret officer and a popular country-we stern singer are a few others likely having succumbed to MONARCH madness. Lee Har vey Oswald, Sirhan-Sirhan, Charlie Manson, John Hinckley Jr., Mark Chapman, Davi d Koresh, Tim McVeigh and John Salvi are some notable names of infamy, strong ly suspected of being pawns who were spawned by MKULTRA. Deprogrammers and Exposers Dr. Corydon Hammond, a Psychologist from the Univers ity of Utah, delivered a stunning lecture entitled “Hypnosis in MPD: Ritual Abuse” at the Fourth Annual Eastern Regional Conference on Abuse and Multiple Pe rsonality, June 25, 1992 in Alexandria, Virginia. He essentially confirmed the suspicions of the attentive crowd of mental health professionals, wherein a certain p ercentage of their clients had undergone mind control programming in an intensivel y systematic manner. Hammond alluded to the Nazi connection, military an d CIA mind control research, Greek letter and color programming and specifically mentioned the Monarch Project in relation to a form of operative conditio ning. Shortly after his ground breaking speech, he receiv ed death threats. Not wanting to jeopardize the safety of his family, Dr. Hammond s topped disseminating any follow-up information, until recently. Mark Philli ps, a former electronics subcontractor for the Department of Defense, was pr ivy to some of the top secret mind control activities perpetrated by the U.S. gov ernment. His inquisitive demeanor, strong conscience and heart-felt concern for Cathy O’Brien, a “Presidential Model’ under Project MONARCH, prompted him to reveal the inner- workings of this grand deception beginning about 19 91. As the story goes, he helped Ms. O’Brien escape from her captors and was able to deprogram her in about a years time in Alaska. The controversial Phi llips has his share of critics who are skeptical of the veracity of his claims. New O rleans therapist Valerie Wolf"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"introduced two of her patients before the President ’s Committee on Human Radiation Experiments on March 15, 1995 in Washingt on D.C. The astonishing testimony made by these two brave women included ac counts of German doctors, torture, drugs, electroshock, hypnosis and rape, be sides being exposed to an undetermined amount of radiation. Both Wolf and her patients stated they recovered the memories of this CIA program without r egression or hypnosis techniques.[19] Wolf presently devotes much of her time to counseling such survivors. A former labor attorney for Atlantic Richfield Co., David E. Rosenbaum, conducted a nine year investigation (1983-1992) concerning al legations of physical torture and coercive conditioning of numerous employees at an A RCO plant in Monaca, PA.[20] His clients, Jerry L. Dotey and Ann White, were vic tims of apparent radiation exposure; but as Mr. Rosenbaum probed deeper in the subsequent interview sessions, a “Pandora’s Box” was unveiled. His most astonishing conclusion was that Jerry Dotey and Ann White were likely the off-sprin g of Adolf Hitler, based in part on the uncanny resemblance from photos (facial feat ures; bone structure and size were taken into consideration). Rosenbaum also sta tes, “They both exhibit feelings and experiences that indicate they are twi ns.” Dotey and White were allegedly subjected to torture of many kinds while under drug induced hypnosis, with each one undergoing at least three training te chniques by plant physicians. Each victim was trained to enter into a hypnotic st ate upon the occurrence of specific stimuli, usually involving a “cue” word or phrase and trained to “remember to forget” what transpired in the hypnoti c state. They were repeatedly subjected to identical stimulus-response sequence, to produce nearly automatic reactions to the particular status. MKULTRA veteran , Dr. Bernard Diamond, Dr. Martin Orne and Dr. Josef Mengele regularly visite d the ARCO plant, according to Rosenbaum. The special conditioning of Dotey and W hite was intended for the artificial creation of dual German personalities. R osenbaum, who is Jewish, has maintained a deep friendship with the two, despite the seemingly precarious circumstances. Other renowned therapists involved in deprogramming are Cynthia Byrtus, Pamela Monday, Steve Ogilvie, Bennett Braun, Jerry Mungadz e and Colin Ross. Some Christian counselors have been able to eliminate par ts of the programming with limited success. Journalists who have recently expounded on the subj ect matter in exemplary fashion are Walter Bowart, Operation Mind Control, J on Rappoport, U.S. Government Mind-Control Experiments on Children and A lex Constantine, Psychic Dictatorship In The USA Conclusion The most incriminating statement to date made by a government official as to the possible existence of Project MONARCH was extracted by Anton Chaitkin, a writer for the publication, The New Federalist. When former CIA Director William Colby was asked dir ectly, “What about monarch?” he replied angrily and ambiguously, “We s topped that between the late 1960’s and the early 1970’s.” Suffice to say that s ociety, in its apparent state of cognitive dissonance, is generally in denial of the over whelming evidence of this multifarious conspiracy. Numerous victims/ survivor s of Project MONARCH are in desperate need of help. However, the great majority of people are too preoccupied with themselves to show any genuine com passion toward these"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"severely wounded individuals. Apathy has taken over the minds of the masses, who choose to exist within the comforts of this world. Reality has thus become obscured by relativism and selfishness. Although there has been some progress in deprogramm ing and reintegrating therapies, a much greater problem needs to be recti fied. The Holy Bible addresses this problem as the fragmentation of the soul (Ezek iel 13:20). A spiritual restoration is what is truly needed (Psalm 23:3) bu t can only take place by completely trusting in Jesus Christ as the way to sa lvation (John 3:16; I Peter 3:18) and deliverance from demonic oppression and/or poss ession (Mark 16:17). The true humility of Christ and the love of God effectiv ely counters the pride and hatred of Satan. Statistically, the road to recovery for these survi vors of unimaginable depravity is a long and tedious one, but God is the ultimate heale r and only within his time, through His strength and by His grace, can the capt ives be set free (Isaiah 61:1).
