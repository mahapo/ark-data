From The Cabinet of Dr Caligari to the tales of Svengali and the bookand films of The Manchurian Candidate, the theme of robotically controlledassassins and hypnotically controlled slaves is in fact a common plot point.Even comedies such as The Naked Gun and later Zoolander use this theme ofassassins who do not know they are assassins; one could even argue that The PiedPiper employed mind manipulation techniques in order to steal away the childrenof his clients. We are also shown in many films and media presentations the concept of multiplepersonalities in characters; this plot device has in fact become old hat now inHollywood through overuse, the audience is no longer shocked to find that themain protagonist is in actuality themselves, the suspect they are looking for,unknown to their true personality. A separate person has manifest within themind of the protagonist, completely detached in actions and memory to theoriginal core personality. This schism is usually shown as the result of someevent or trauma so powerful as to literally shatter the mind of the protagonistinto distinct personalities. This plot point is perhaps more accurate than mostpeople realise. This manipulation of the mind is actually far from science fiction and has beenwell documented in primary sources such as declassified documents, courthearings, exposés in the media by those involved boasting at their prowess andby insider whistle-blowers. The subject has also been discussed by manyresearchers in a secondary sense; notable inclusions are the fantastic anddetailed work of Jim Keith and Dr. Colin Ross. Many of the books in the public eye are littered with disinformation, usuallysuggesting there is little actual success in the field of mind manipulation. Iwill draw together the evidence to show the scope of these projects and provethat mind control, in all its forms, was and is used to control us on numerouslevels. What exactly do we mean by mind control? We are talking about the ability tocontrol a person’s thoughts and actions, in order to have them do the bidding oftheir programmers against their own will and in some cases, against their ownmoral code. In this realm, we are speaking of robotically controlledindividuals, slaves to the whims of their masters. This can not only apply tothe individual in programming of personal thought and action but can also beutilised in the arena of mass manipulation or mass programming, affecting largesections of the public. This can run the gamut from advertising techniques thatmanipulate our subconscious without our knowledge, to lies by the media and fullmilitary propaganda designed to shape the ideology of a nation. Indeed, theapplication of individual mind control experiments would instantly fail were itnot for the mass manipulation techniques that tell the public; this sort oftechnique is not possible, it is in the arena of science fiction or espionagethrillers. What I intend to prove is that this is far from science fiction. The fact that U.S., U.K., Chinese and Russian governments were involved invarying levels of individual and mass mind control programmes is not evendenied, rather it is often passed over with the explanation that, “it was adifferent time, the cold war made us paranoid and justified our actions” and ofcourse the classic, “we never achieved our goals in any meaningful senseanyway”. In fact we can even see the propaganda posters from Nazi Germany orCommunist Russia and in our wise Western way, decode them for the manipulationthey are, without applying that same critical analysis to the images weourselves are presented with every day. We seem to forget that the aim ofpropaganda is to disguise itself as fact. The U.S. mind control programmes started in April 1950 with the beginning of thefabled Project BLUEBIRD. The official reason for any U.S. involvement with thedark arts of mind control is that it was a response to Communist methods usedagainst American G.I.’s in the Korean War, fearing that Americans were beingbrainwashed into confessing and defecting to the Communist regime. However, asthe start of this programme predates the cited conflict, we can see clearly thatthis explanation too is manipulative propaganda directed against the public tomanage their perceptions of the world. Project CHATTER was a United States Navy[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy] programme beginning in theautumn of 1947, primarily involved in the testing of different drugs ininterrogation scenarios and collecting results on their usefulness. Theprogramme was led by Dr. Charles Savage of the Naval Medical Research Institute[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Medical_Research_Institute], Bethesda,Maryland [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda,_Maryland] and ran from 1947 to1953. The doctors involved used both natural and synthetic concoctions on theirtest subjects in order to achieve their required results. Project CHATTERinvolved experimentation on animals and humans alike, with large doses ofscopolamine, mescaline and various other potions and narcotics used ininterrogation scenarios. This project also predated the Korean War. Project ARTICHOKE was the continuation of BLUEBIRD, officially beginning on 20August 1951, and run by the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Scientific_Intelligence]. The desiredresults of the project were charted in a memo, dated January 1952, that stated, \"Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our biddingagainst his will and even against fundamental laws of nature, such asself-preservation?\" [1] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn1] The project studied hypnosis [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnosis], forcedmorphine [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine] and heroin addiction[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence], followed by subsequentforced withdrawal and the use of various other chemicals, among other methods,in order to produce amnesia and other vulnerable states in subjects, ostensiblyfor interrogation purposes. A CIA Document, dated 26 April 1952, stated thatthose employed in Artichoke interrogations, “Used heroin on a routine basis (as this) can be useful in reverse because ofthe stresses produced when they are withdrawn from those who are addicted totheir use.” BLUEBIRD and ARTICHOKE were rolled into the umbrella term MK ULTRA in 1953. Whentalking about mind control projects, the term MK ULTRA is often used to refer tomind control experiments in general as its brief was so varied. MK ULTRA had atleast 149 sub projects that we know of. In 1963, MK ULTRA was renamed MK SEARCH, which ran until the early 1970’s whenall pertinent documentation was destroyed at the behest of the CIA and theprojects then officially disbanded, although more likely were reclassified.Other projects that emerged from the U.S. administration were MK NAOMI, MK DELTAand QKHILLTOP. Though different delineations had slightly different aims andobjectives, we can view all these projects as a continuation of the broaderheading of mind control experimentation. MK NAOMI reportedly focused onbiological projects including biological warfare[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_warfare] agents; specifically, to storematerials that could either incapacitate or kill a test subject and to developdevices for the diffusion of such materials. This is essentially flowerylanguage for individual and mass drugging. A 1967 CIA memo uncovered by theChurch Committee [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee] (aninvestigation into clandestine government experimentation, conducted in 1975)showed evidence of at least three covert techniques for attacking and poisoningcrops that had been examined under field conditions, meaning they were tested inreal world scenarios. On 25 November 1969, President Richard Nixon[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon] officially abolished any militarypractice involving biological weapons and Project MK NAOMI was dissolved. On 14February 1970, a presidential order was invoked to outlaw all stockpiles ofbacteriological weapons and nonliving toxins. This however, did not deter U.S.scientists from stockpiling huge amounts of lethal shellfish poisons in FortDetrick until the mid 1970’s. The center of mind control in the U.K. appears to be a charitable organizationnamed Tavistock. The Tavistock Clinic began during the First World War, treatingreturning soldiers suffering from shell shock as a result of their horrificexperiences. The clinic itself sprang up out of Wellington House, the BritishMilitary propaganda agency responsible for weaning public opinion round to anacceptance of war with Germany. The studies on the effects of trauma and thebreaking point of humans proved seemingly invaluable as the clinic morphed intothe Tavistock Institute of Human Relations and began to focus on organizing anddirecting social orders through social psychological manipulation. Tavistock, employing its psychological methods, is used by corporations,citizens and countries to define the norms, entrain business leaders and gentlycoerce society into the direction that is best for it, in their considered,authoritarian opinion. By understanding and utilizing the effects of trauma,they can reduce the critical analysis of individuals or a nation, terrifyingthem to run into the arms of their authoritarian saviors, namely the state, atany given problem that threatens them. Tavistock practitioners discovered the most effective way to ensure devotion tothe leaders was to provide a solution to the terrible problems faced by thepeople. These manufactured external events shake the core of the populous, whichlook to authority to save them and provide a solution. Acting like a consolingfather figure, the solutions required by the public can be suggested by theauthorities and likely, regardless of the action, if it solves the immediateproblem the public will not only accept this but clamour for the change. This ishow nations and national identities are formed. I believe mind control in all its forms to still be an active concern of allmilitary-industrialised countries intelligence agencies. I believe that thereare projects for individual countries and their respective secret serviceagencies but also collusion and sharing of experimental results, techniques andmethodology at the very top level of military and government, or moreaccurately, ‘shadow government’. U.S. and U.K. collusion in the ultimate goal ofmind control is proven by the association of certain doctors within the fieldand an overlapping of sponsorship and related parties, but strangely, Nazi andCommunist agencies also appear to show an increasingly open level ofcommunication and similarity of techniques. In this book I examine the origins, objectives and architects in the field ofmind control. I address the beginnings of the mind control programmes, thedoctors involved in the U.K. and the U.S. and the different methods theyemployed, moving from trauma, to drugs, to hypnosis and then externalpsychotronic machinery. Using this evidence, we can then speculate on some ofthe more famous cases of alleged mind control. One point that I wish to make absolutely clear is that all of this informationis available in the public domain. Some of the sources are obscure but, moreoften than not, it is dependent on knowing what to look for; often theinformation is in national media publications. I will say again that thisinformation is available to the general public, however, one of the mostimpressive mind control programmes employed is convincing people that there isno possibility of this capability existing at all. “Mind control: psychological reality or mindless rhetoric? “Mind control is theprocess by which individual or collective freedom of choice and action iscompromised by agents or agencies that modify or distort perception, motivation,affect, cognition and/or behavioural outcomes. It is neither magical normystical, but a process that involves a set of basic social psychologicalprinciples. Conformity, compliance, persuasion, dissonance, reactance, guilt andfear arousal, modelling and identification are some of the staple socialinfluence ingredients well studied in psychological experiments and fieldstudies. In some combinations, they create a powerful crucible of extreme mentaland behavioural manipulation when synthesized with several other real-worldfactors, such as charismatic, authoritarian leaders, dominant ideologies, socialisolation, physical debilitation, induced phobias, and extreme threats orpromised rewards that are typically deceptively orchestrated, over an extendedtime period in settings where they are applied intensively….has also beenreported that the CIA put into practice nearly 150 projects–collectively termedMKULTRA–to develop various forms of exotic mind control, including the use ofLSD and hypnosis.”[2] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn2]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE: FOUNDATIONS OF RESEARCH Officially MK ULTRA, the U.S.A. CIA mind control programme, began on 13April1953; the study led by Sidney Gottlieb (appointed by CIA Director AllenDulles who approved the project). This was formally claimed to be in response toKorean and Chinese techniques being used against American prisoners of war, inorder to gain a confession. MK ULTRA appears to be grounded not only in the workof Allied and Tavistock-affiliated scientists, but also in WWII experimentsperformed by Nazi scientists, doctors and psychiatrists who escaped Nurembergand were brought to America in Operation Paperclip. In 1946, President Truman authorized Operation Paperclip to exploit theexpertise of German scientists for American research and to, “deny theseintellectual resources to the Soviet Union”. A 1999 report to the U.S. Senatestated that between 1945 and 1955, 765 scientists, engineers and technicianswere brought to the U.S. under Paperclip and similar programmes. Some of thereports bluntly pointed out that those helped to escape justice were “ardentNazis”; experts accused of participating in murderous medical experiments onhuman subjects at concentration camps. Other researchers have placed the numberof liberated German scientists much higher; “Over 1,000 German scientists were secretly brought into the US without StateDepartment approval. The most famous individual brought over in this manner wasWerner von Braun, the rocket scientist. Von Braun was the head of the German V2rocket program. The NASA rockets that took Neil Armstrong to the moon were builtby von Braun and his colleagues.”[3] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn3] It is alleged that Von Braun’s file, which proclaimed him as “an ardent Nazi”,simply had the word ‘not’ supplanted in front of this opening sentence, in orderto make him appear to be a suitable candidate for gainful employment by NASA. The ‘MK’ in MK ULTRA, allegedly originates from the German words for mindcontrol (meinungskontrolle). If this is true, it is a very fitting explanationfor the cruelty involved in the project, although Sidney Gottlieb suggested thename was nothing to do with Germany and simply a coded filing system. In 1994, a report concerning the MK ULTRA programme[http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_mindcon02.htm] wasissued, containing the following information: \"In the 1950s and ’60s, the CIA engaged in an extensive program of humanexperimentation, using drugs, psychological, and other means, in search oftechniques to control human behaviour for counterintelligence and covert actionpurposes.” This report then clarified the CIA’s actions in attempting to keep the projectsclandestine: \"In 1973, the CIA purposefully destroyed most of the MKULTRA files concerningits research and testing on human behaviour. In 1977, the agency uncoveredadditional MKULTRA files in the budget and fiscal records that were not indexedunder the name MKULTRA. These documents detailed over 150 subprojects that theCIA funded in this area, but no evidence was uncovered at that time concerningthe use of radiation…The CIA did investigate the use and effect of microwaves onhuman beings in response to a Soviet practice of beaming microwaves on the USembassy. The agency determined that this was outside the scope of the AdvisoryCommittee’s purview.” The report also highlighted that, in order to maintain secrecy in all stages ofthe projects, documentation was purposefully kept to a bare minimum: \"The Church Committee found some records, but also noted that the practice ofMKULTRA at that time was ’to maintain no records of the planning and approval oftest programs’. ...MKULTRA itself was technically closed out in 1964, but someof its work was transferred to the Office of Research and Development (ORD)within the DS&T under the name MKSEARCH and continued into the 1970s…The CIAworked closely with the Army in conducting the LSD experiments. This connectionwith the Army is significant because MKULTRA began at the same time thatSecretary of Defence Wilson issued his 1953 directive to the military serviceson ethical guidelines for human experiments. Throughout the course of MKULTRA, the CIA sponsored numerous experiments onunwitting humans. After the death of one such individual (Frank Olson, an armyscientist, was given LSD in 1953 and committed suicide a week later), aninternal CIA investigation warned about the dangers of such experimentation. TheCIA persisted in this practice for at least the next ten years. After the 1963IG [Inspector-General] report recommended termination of unwitting testing,Deputy Director for Plans Richard Helms (who later became Director of CentralIntelligence) continued to advocate covert testing on the ground that ’positiveoperational capability to use drugs is diminishing, owing to a lack of realistictesting. With increasing knowledge of state of the art, we are less capable ofstaying up with the Soviet advances in this field’. ...Helms attributed thecessation of the unwitting testing to the high risk of embarrassment to theAgency as well as the ’moral problem’. He noted that no better covert situationhad been devised than that which had been used, and that ’we have no answer tothe moral issue’.\"[4] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn4] In the U.K., the entity that is alleged to shape the social order of the worldas we are led to see it is known as the Tavistock Institute. The TavistockInstitute of Human Relations is a charity organisation, concerned with socialcontrol and applying psychological warfare methods to countries in order tocreate dissent, fear and reduce morale. It officially began its operations inthe U.K. in 1921. In 1932, Tavistock was put under the directorship of KurtLewin, a German Psychiatrist and later, a founder member of the OSS, theprecursor to the CIA. Lewin was primarily interested in the mass brainwashing ofwhole populations by applying repeated trauma and torture to society at large.By amazing coincidence, this appears to be a remarkably similar time to thebeginnings of Nazi interest in mind control. The Tavistock Clinic[http://www.tavistockandportman.nhs.uk/] in London, where many of theInstitute’s methodologies were crafted, was founded in 1920 by Dr. HughCrichton-Miller, a psychiatrist who developed psychological treatments forshell-shocked soldiers during and after the First World War. During World War II, several Tavistock staff members served in the U.K. ArmedForces; John Rawlings Rees becoming chief of Army Psychiatric Services and G. R.Hargreaves being appointed as Assistant Director of Army Psychiatry. ThroughTavistock they brought together such eminent names in the field of socialpsychology as Bion, Bowlby, Bridger, Dicks, Foulkes, Kelnar, MacKeith, Main,Morris, Phillipson, Rickman, Rodger and Wittkower, forming what Rees referred toas an \"invisible college\". The group began working on producing the mosteffective methods of officer selection, training, inducing or reducing morale,civil resettlement, therapeutic communities, and group therapy. In 1946, some ofthese social psychologists went on to form the Tavistock Institute of HumanRelations, an interdisciplinary group interested in the problems of initiatingchange in large organisations and society. This group also established ajournal, Human Relations, and publishing house, Tavistock Publications Ltd.Tavistock created the Family Discussion Bureau and Tavistock Marital StudiesInstitute and in the Tavistock Clinic they also established a unit foradolescents. Tavistock certainly seems to have a hand in the development ofnearly all areas of society. Mind control researcher and author Jim Keith summarised, “Tavistock, a collaborative effort of British Military Intelligence and thepsychiatric establishment was created in 1921 reportedly on the orders ofmembers of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (also known as Chathamhouse). The RIIA is an arm of the British Rhodes Round Table group, founded byBritish imperialist and freemason Cecil Rhodes. The Round Table, functioningthrough a myriad of offshoots, has been this century’s most effective proponentfor the creation of a one world government. Tavistock relies on grants for itsoperation from the Rockefellers, Carnegies, the British Home Office and largeanonymous grants. Initially run by British Military intelligence officer MajorJohn Rawlings, from its inception Tavistock was intended as a coordinatingcentre for planetary social control using “psychological shock troops a termcoined by Rees.” [5] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn5] After his famous wartime flight to Scotland and subsequent capture, Nazi RudolphHess was interviewed by psychiatrist [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry]John Rawlings Rees [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawlings_Rees], who hadworked at the Tavistock Clinic [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavistock_Clinic]prior to serving as a brigadier [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadier] in theBritish Army [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army]. Dr. Rees was the firstpresident and director of the Tavistock Institute. Rees concluded that thecaptured Hess was not insane, but was certainly mentally ill[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_illness] and suffering from depression[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_depression], attributing this state ofmind to the failure of his mysterious mission. The diaries of Hess from thistime gave details of his imprisonment in Britain after 1941. These diaries makemany references to visits from Rees, whom Hess clearly did not like and who heaccused of trying to poison him. The diaries also make many mentions of Reesattempts to \"mesmerize\" him. At the time, hypnotism was referred to asmesmerism, named after Franz Anton Mesmer. Mesmer was a German physician who theorised that there was a natural energetictransference that occurred between all animated and inanimate objects. Hereferred to this process as animal magnetism. Mesmer's ideas and practices ledScottish surgeon James Braid[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Braid_(surgeon)] to develop hypnosis[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnosis] in 1842. What we seem to see in the Hess-Rees encounter is the possible testing of truthdrugs (poisons) and hypnotism (mesmerism), in order to coerce a confession orinduce a loss of willpower, as early as 1941. Dr. Rees later took part in theNuremberg Trials of 1945. These were to punish captured Nazi agents, but notthose who were already in America, the U.K. and various other safe havens,either through operations like Paperclip or through the Vatican Rat Lines. Tavistock is essentially a psychological think-tank that advises and trainsbusiness and world leaders in the most effective ways to achieve their ends.Quite who decides what is the best direction for the organisation (or indeed thecountry) in question is less than clear. “The English Tavistock Institute has not restricted its activities to left-winggroups, but has also directed the programs of such supposedly \"conservative\"American think tanks as the Herbert Hoover Institute at Stanford University,Heritage Foundation, Wharton, Hudson, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, andRand. The \"sensitivity training\" and \"sexual encounter\" programs of the mostradical California groups such as Esalen Institute and its many imitators wereall developed and implemented by Tavistock Institute psychologists. One of the rare items concerning the Tavistock Institute appears in BusinessWeek, Oct. 26, 1963, with a photograph of its building in the most expensivemedical offices area of London. The story mentions \"the Freudian bias\" of theInstitute, and comments that it is amply financed by British blue-chipcorporations, including Unilever, British Petroleum, and Baldwin Steel.According to Business Week, the psychological testing programs and grouprelations training programs of the Institute were implemented in the UnitedStates by the University of Michigan and the University of California, which arehotbeds of radicalism and the drug network. It was the Marquees of Tavistock, 12th Duke of Bedford, whom Rudolf Hess flew toEngland to contact about ending World War II. Tavistock was said to be worth $40million in 1942. In 1945, his wife committed suicide by taking an overdose ofpills.”[6] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn6] The Tavistock signature approach, ‘Future Shock’, is the ‘deprogramming’ of thesubjects of a nation to a near vegetative state, through the use of torture andtrauma, leaving a clean, blank state ready for subsequent ‘reprogramming’.Tavistock employs a protracted trauma on the population through a sustainedcampaign of fear and social uncertainty. This shellshocks the population over aperiod of time, in order to quell any detailed examination and maintain thesocial status quo. Future Shock is also the name of a novel written by the futurist[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurist] author Alvin Toffler[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Toffler] in 1970. In the book, Tofflerdefined the term “future shock” as a psychological state which can affect bothindividuals and also entire societies. His briefest explanation of the term wasa personal perception [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception] of \"too muchchange in too short a period of time\". Toffler put forward the argument thatsociety was undergoing an enormous structural change, an ever quickeningrevolution from an industrial society[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_society] to a \"super-industrial society[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-industrial_society]\". This change would, inToffler’s opinion, be far too much for people, overwhelming them, theaccelerating rate of the wave of technological and social change leaving themfeeling a sense of disconnection and suffering from \"shattering stress anddisorientation\", namely future shocked. Toffler stated that the majority ofsocial problems were symptoms of this future shock. In his discussion of thecomponents of such shock, he also popularized the term \"information overload[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload]\". In the text of Future Shock, Toffler quoted psychologist Herbert Gerjuoy asfollows: \"The new education must teach the individual how to classify and reclassifyinformation, how to evaluate its veracity, how to change categories whennecessary, how to move from the concrete to the abstract and back, how to lookat problems from a new direction—how to teach himself. Tomorrow's illiteratewill not be the man who can't read; he will be the man who has not learned howto learn.\"[7] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn7] The main question surely, is who will be the teachers? Dr. John Coleman has spent many years researching the activities of Tavistock.As to their creation, he noted, “The plan to 'create' public opinion began in 1913 as a propaganda factorycentred at Wellington House in London. Sir Edward Grey, the British ForeignSecretary at the time, installed Lord Northcliffe (Britain's most influentialnewspaper magnate) as its director. Lord Northcliffe's position was over sightedby Lord Rothmere on behalf of the British Crown. The operational staff ofWellington House consisted of Lord Northcliffe, Arnold Toynbee (future directorof studies at the Royal Institute of International Affairs), and the Americans,Walter Lippmann and Edward Bernays (nephew to Sigmund Freud).Funding was initially provided by the Royal family, but soon to include theRothschild’s (related to Lord Northcliffe by marriage) and the Rockefellers.Wellington House would grow into the Tavistock Institute in 1921 after thepropaganda \"victories\" of the First World War and the Federal Reserve bankingsystem (created in 1913) had been secured.”[8] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn8] Tavistock is also seemingly interested in crowd control, authority entrainingfor business and world leaders and psy-ops (psychological operations or mindgames employed by the military). It was members of Tavistock that recommendedcarpet bombing civilians to induce terror during wartime. It has been suggestedthat the Strategic Bombing Survey carried out under Sir Arthur Harris of theRAF, which systematically bombed the houses of civilian workers, was considereda key tactic in the psychological battle against Germany. Historians report thatthe Royal Air Force carried out their first civilian bombing campaign atFreiberg in February 1940. This was continued with Tavistock’s ‘PrudentialBombing Campaign’, aimed solely at civilian targets, in order to destroy thecountry’s morale, as well as people and property. Despite popular belief thatGermany bombed the civilian population of London first, it has been suggestedthat it was in fact up to eight weeks after the attack on Freiberg that theGerman Luftwaffe retaliated with like-for-like tactics. Kurt Lewin, director of Tavistock from 1932 tellingly stated; “if terror can beinduced on a widespread basis into society it reverts to a blank state wherecontrol can be instituted from an exterior point”, meaning that, by the creationof controlled chaos, the general populace can be brought to the point where itwillingly submits to greater control. This sounds remarkably close to thefreemasonic maxim “order out of chaos”. Tavistock has been known to call its collection of psychiatrists an “invisiblecollege”, harking back to freemasonic mystery schools. Some researchers havepointed out that in ancient Egypt, practices that strongly resemble mind controltechniques were performed by members of the mystery religions; “The Mystery Religions of ancient Egypt, Greece, India and Babylon helped laythe foundation for occultism, meaning “hidden knowledge.” One of the earliestwritings giving reference to occultism is the Egyptian Book of the Dead, acompilation of rituals explicitly describing methods of torture and intimidation(to create trauma), the use of potions (drugs) and the casting of spells(hypnotism), ultimately resulting in the total enslavement of the initiate.”[9][part0000_split_023.html#_edn9] Lewin maintained that society must be driven into a state equivalent to an'early childhood situation'. He termed this societal chaos “fluidity”. Lewinlater took his expertise in research to America, where he founded the StanfordResearch Centre, MIT, The National Institute of Mental Health, the WhartonSchool of Economics and many other institutions, seemingly in order to furtherthe influence of Tavistock on the global stage. Lewin was also influential inplacing key figures in other institutions, such as the Rand Corporation and theEsalen research facility. It was Tavistock founder Dr. John Rawlings Rees who originally envisaged aninvisible army of what he termed “shock troops”; Tavistock agents who would besent out and placed strategically in high positions to develop and nurtureTavistock projects. These shock troops would be placed in any and every socialand professional function and institute, with a directive to influence in aclandestine manner. In 1954, Rees explained the function of the Shock Troop; “Their job is to apply the advanced techniques of psychological warfare as weknow them to whole population groups that will grow even larger, so that wholepopulations may be more easily controlled. In a world driven completely mad,groups of Tavistock psychologists linked to each other, capable of influencingthe political and governmental field must be arbiters, the power cabal.” In a candid explanation of his particular method of overpowering the will of theindividual and ultimately, society, Kurt Lewin stated; “The inner self of the individual displays certain reactions when under tensionfrom the environment. When there is no tension, then the normal inner self of aperson is well differentiated, balanced multifaceted, versatile…When areasonable amount of tension is applied from the environment, then all thevarious abilities and faculties of the inner self go on alert, ready foreffective action. But, when an intolerable amount of tension is applied, thenthis geometry collapses into a blinded, undifferentiated soup; a primitive, aregressed personality. The person is reduced to an animal; the highlydifferentiated and versatile abilities disappear. The controlled environmenttakes over the personality.”[10] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn10] Edward Bernays is considered the father of public relations and, as Dr. JohnColeman noted, was connected to the inception of Wellington House, the precursorto Tavistock. Bernays was nephew to Sigmund Freud twice; his mother, Anna, wasFreud’s sister and his father, Ely Bernays, was brother to Freud’s wife. Hewrote the seminal work on public relations and marketing: Propaganda. The firstchapter was titled Organizing Chaos and opened with, “The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinionsof the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those whomanipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible governmentwhich is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds aremoulded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have neverheard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society isorganized.” Bernays stated: “As civilizations becomes more complex, and as the need for invisible governmenthas been increasingly demonstrated, the technical means have been invented anddeveloped by which the public opinion can be regimented. With the printing pressand the newspaper, the telephone, telegraph, radio and airplanes, ideas canspread rapidly and even instantaneously.”[11] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn11] Eric Trist, then-chairman of the Tavistock governors, described their work in1963 as creating “social turbulence”, based on the Hegelian dialectic of thesis,antithesis, and synthesis. The basic premise of this concept is to provide aproblem or an idea which seems too revolutionary, too far a stretch for thepublic or too great a trauma. When the public reacts, you as an authority stepin and offer a solution, a synthesis of the original premise and the public’sreaction. The trick is that the third way, a solution that seems to suit allparties, is the original intention. More often than not, this third way, whichcould be a ‘slightly’ less high tax or price increase or ‘slightly’ reducedcivil liberties (as opposed to the original large scale changes) would neverhave been accepted by the public except in these exceptional circumstances.David Icke termed this process ‘Problem, Reaction, Solution’. Trist postulatedthat traumatizing shocks upon society would desensitise and destabilize it,lowering its overall character and its reasoning capability. He proudlyannounced that in 1963, thanks to the continued efforts of Tavistock, the worldwas already in a state of permanent social turbulence. By controlling perception of the world through language, Tavistock also helpsdirect world events. Tavistock rose directly from Wellington House, theorganisation that was able to alter public opinion in order to position thepublic as willing participants in the First World War. This was achieved in partby characterising those opposed to the war in America as “isolationists”.Utilising the new techniques of communication media, the term ‘isolationist’ wasused as a derogatory description of any American citizen who held a contraryopinion of the need for the U.S. to become part of the war. The organisationused shame and a fear of standing out from the crowd to mould public opinion.Terms like “regime change”, meaning military takeover and “collateral damage”,meaning civilian deaths, were also introduced by Tavistock as a method ofsoftening the harsh realities of war. It is with methods like this thatTavistock is able to form public opinion to the point that people believe theirthoughts to be original and organic. As Edward Bernays stated, “If we understand the mechanisms and motives of the group mind, it is nowpossible to control and regiment the masses according to our will without themknowing it.” This technique was named ‘engineering consent’ and is most effectively utilisedwith the use of what Bernays called “third party advocates”. These areessentially authority figures or peers who, through their influence, can shapethe opinions of the public. Bernays noted, “If you can influence the leaders,either with or without their conscious cooperation, you automatically influencethe group which they sway”. This is particularly applicable in today’s celebritydriven era, when a single television appearance can dictate fashion or theopinion of thousands. Tavistock also offers business entraining in order to make more effectivecaptains of industry, particularly in America at its National TrainingLaboratory. Clients of the National Training Laboratory, who were schooled instress situations and how to most effectively deal with them, include Microsoft,IBM, AT and T, CBS, NBC, ABC, Westinghouse, Halliburton, Alcoa, Shell, BP,Mobil-Exxon, DuPont, Eli-Lily, Nestle, Wells Fargo Bank of America, BechtelCorp, Hewlett Packard and the New York Stock Exchange. The U.S. government, U.S.Navy, U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Civil Service Commission, U.S. PostalService, FBI, CIA, U.S. Department of Naval Intelligence, U.S. Department ofDefence and the U.S. State Department are also clients of the National TrainingLaboratory and Tavistock founded subsidiaries. Courses on offer at the National Training Laboratory include ‘Group Encounters’and ‘Sensitivity’ programmes. Essentially, this involves the breaking down of anindividual’s personality and belief structure, then rebuilding it in the mouldof the overall group. Using the psychological need for conformity and the fearof ridicule by standing out from the crowd, these ‘Sensitivity’ courses are inreality a method to manipulate group thinking. Although these training devicesare portrayed as personal development tools, they are in actuality a way tomanipulate individuals into groups, which can be controlled along the desiredlines of the leaders of the organisation. The individual is convinced that what is good for the wider group is the mostbeneficial for them, attaching their psyche to the group in order to bolsterpositive feelings. It should be noted at this point that a remarkably similartechnique is employed by cult leaders. Techniques such as singling out anydissent and ridiculing any deviation are commonplace. Conversely, the process oflove bombing, saturating the individual with positive feelings, as long as theyreach an understanding with the group as a whole, is employed to draw theindividual into the mind of the group. If there is one particular candidate that refuses to be swayed by thesocialisation tactics employed, a new method is used. The group leader will takethe ‘disruptive’ element to one side and congratulate them. They will be toldthat they are clearly more advanced than the rest of the group and that they,through their insight, have shown the type of intelligence and aptitude that thecompany is looking for. The candidate will then possibly be told that this isthe true nature of the test, to route out people, like themselves, who do notbow to public opinion and speak their mind. After flattering the candidate,implying that they are exceptional and show an understanding that is lacking inthe others, the candidate is asked, for the good of the less talented group, tomerely ‘play along’ with the session. With this method of buttering up, thedisruptive influence is silenced and furthermore, drops their guard, allowingthe remainder of the session to wash over them with no real objections. Often these seminars are very long, in small rooms with limited fresh air, indull surroundings and often exercises will require the participant to stand.This is essentially exhausting the individual with low level stress positions,clouding their judgement to make them more malleable. Group exercises and teamgames are used to bond the group, but also to make individuals feel guilty andresponsible for their team-mate’s shortcomings and drag them into touch for thegood of the group. It is clear that the Tavistock Institute is far more influential than it mayappear at first. The ideology of the organisation has been spread through boththe business world and the corridors of government across the globe. The tacticsused by Tavistock make it clear that the individual is merely a cog in a farlarger machine and the control of the overall mechanism, rather than thecomponent pieces, is what is considered important. This influence has beenmaking forays into the wider world since at least 1913."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO: COMMUNISTS, NAZIS AND THE CIA “BLUEBIRD was approved by the CIA director on April 20, 1950. In August 1951,the Project was renamed ARTICHOKE. BLUEBIRD and ARTICHOKE included a great dealof work on the creation of amnesia, hypnotic couriers, and the ManchurianCandidate, ARTICHOKE documents prove that hypnotic couriers functionedeffectively in real-life simulations conducted by the CIA in the early 1950’s.The degree to which such individuals were used in actual operations is stillclassified…. BLUEBIRD and ARTICHOKE were administered in a compartmentedfashion. The details of the programs were kept secret even form other personnelwithin the CIA…. The BLUEBIRD/ARTICHOKE materials establish conclusively thatfull Manchurian Candidates were created and tested successfully by physicianswith TOP SECRET clearance from the CIA As well as being potential couriers andinfiltration agents, the subjects could function in effect as hypnoticallycontrolled cameras. They could enter a room or building, memorize materialsquickly, leave the building, and then be amnesic for the entire episode. Thememorized material could then be retrieved by a handler using a previouslyimplanted code or signal, without the amnesia being disturbed. Hypnosis was notthe mind control doctors’ only method for creation of controlled amnesia,however. Drugs, magnetic fields, sound waves, sleep deprivation, solitaryconfinement, and many other methods were studied under BLUEBIRD and ARTICHOKE.”[12] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn12] Some of the more observant may have noticed the significance of the date chosento begin the U.S.A.’s official foray into mind control. By pure coincidence I amsure, BLUEBIRD began on the anniversary of Hitler’s birth. Notes from the BLUEBIRD era of mind control were often vague and even undated inorder to cause more confusion, but a later report from the CIA clearly statesits aims and objectives: “a) Discovering means of conditioning personnel to prevent unauthorizedextraction of information of them by known means. b) The possibility of obtaining control of an individual by the application ofspecial interrogation techniques. c) Memory enhancement. d) Establishing means for preventing hostile control of Agency Personnel.”[13][part0000_split_023.html#_edn13] In a declassified document dated 1950, the CIA noted that it would, “Consider special or unorthodox methods such as brain damage, sensorystimulation, hypnosis, so called “black psychiatry”, Pavlovian conditioning,brainwashing or any methods having pertinence for such procedures asinterrogation, subversion or seduction.” Prior to the official start of the project termed MK ULTRA, the CIA were alreadydipping their toes into several areas of control, interrogation and mindmanipulation. The excellent book Acid Dreams - The CIA, LSD, and the Sixties Rebellion, byMartin A. Lee and Bruce Shlain, identified Project CHATTER as a programme underthe direction of Dr. Charles Savage of the Naval Medical Research Institute[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Medical_Research_Institute], Bethesda,Maryland [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda,_Maryland], from 1947[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947] to 1953 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953]: “It began in the fall of 1947 focusing on the identification and testing ofdrugs (LSD and others) in interrogations and the recruitment of agents. Theresearch included laboratory experiments on both animal and human subjects. Theprogram ended shortly after the Korean War in 1953. It was run under the direction of Dr. Charles Savage of the Naval MedicalResearch Institute, Bethesda, MD from 1947 - 1953, after which CIA's Office ofScientific Intelligence continued it under the name Project Bluebird, its firstmind control program to:-- learn how to condition subjects to withstand information from being extractedfrom them by known means;-- develop interrogation methods to exert control;-- develop memory enhancement techniques; and-- establish ways to prevent hostile control of Agency personnel.”[14][part0000_split_023.html#_edn14] The projects continued and broadened in both method and intention. “Project ARTICHOKE (also referred to as Operation ARTICHOKE) was a CIA[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA] project that researched interrogation[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogation] methods and arose from ProjectBLUEBIRD on August 20, 1951, run by the Office of Scientific Intelligence[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency_Office_of_Scientific_Intelligence].A memorandum by Richard Helms [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Helms] toCIA director Allen Welsh Dulles[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Welsh_Dulles] indicated Artichoke becameProject MKULTRA [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKULTRA] on April 13,1953.”[15] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn15] Allen Dulles was born in Washington in 1893, the son of a Presbyterian ministerand the brother of John Foster Dulles[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAdulles.htm], who became the U.S.Secretary of State[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State] under President[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States] Dwight D.Eisenhower [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower]. His grandfatherwas John Watson Foster, Secretary of State under President Benjamin Harrison[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAharrison.htm]. His uncle, RobertLansing [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAlansing.htm], was Secretary ofState in the cabinet of President Woodrow Wilson[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWwilsonW.htm]. After attending PrincetonUniversity, he joined the diplomatic service in 1916 and was stationed inVienna, Berne, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul. Dulles served as a State Departmentdelegate to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, which brought a formal end toWorld War I. In 1922 he was appointed as Chief of Division of Near EasternAffairs. During the Second World War [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WW.htm],Dulles served in Europe with the Office of Strategic Services[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWoss.htm], also known as the OSS, underWilliam ‘Wild Bill’ Donovan[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWdonovanW.htm]. He was stationed inSwitzerland [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWswitzerland.htm] and wasable to use his base in this neutral country to obtain important information onNazi Germany [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERnazigermany.htm] and theGestapo [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERgestapo.htm]. He would alsobecome the lawyer for the Thyssens' Rotterdam bank and represent other Germanfirms, including I.G. Farben, whilst working for the firm Sullivan and Cromwell. As soon as the Second World War [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WW.htm]ended, President Harry S. Truman[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAtruman.htm] ordered the OSS to beclosed down; however, it provided a usable model for the Central IntelligenceAgency [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWcia.htm] (CIA), established inSeptember 1947. Dulles joined the CIA and became director of the organization in1953. “ARTICHOKE and BLUEBIRD were administratively rolled over into MKULTRA, whichwas created by the CIA on April 3, 1953. MKULTRA was in turn rolled over intoMKSEARCH on June 7, 1964. MKSEARCH then ran until June 1972, at which timeextensive shredding of MKULTRA and MKSEARCH files was ordered by the Director ofthe CIA, Richard Helms. The surviving MKULTRA documents can be obtained from theCIA under the Freedom of Information Act. There was a round of declassificationof mind control documents in the 1970’s which were the foundation of bookspublished in the 1970’s and 1980’s.”[16] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn16] From its inception, the mind control doctors employed by the intelligenceagencies were unafraid to test a wide variety of exotic and dangerous substanceson unwitting subjects in order to achieve their ends: “In order to \"perfect techniques for the abstraction of information fromindividuals, whether willing or not\", Project Bluebird researchers experimentedwith a wide variety of psychoactive substances, including LSD[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD], heroin[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin], marijuana[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marijuana], cocaine[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine], PCP[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phencyclidine], mescaline[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mescaline], and ether[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ether]. Project Bluebird researchers dosed over7,000 U.S. military personnel with LSD [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD],without their knowledge or consent, at the Edgewood Arsenal[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgewood_Arsenal] in Maryland[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland]. More than 1,000 of these soldierssuffered from several psychiatric illnesses, including depression[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder] and epilepsy[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy], as a result of the tests. Many of themtried to commit suicide [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide].”[17][part0000_split_023.html#_edn17] Various delineations of the project were established but all can be collectivelytermed as ‘mind control projects’. “The operational wing of MKULTRA, known as MKDELTA, had as its mission to findout how to use chemical and biological weapon ingredients to alter the humanmind. In 1952, the CIA initiated yet another program to produce biologicalweapons called Project MKNAOMI which developed an array of deadly substances forthe CIA”[18] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn18] Despite all the evidence to the contrary, the official explanation still remainsthat all U.S. mind control methods were introduced as a necessary response toCommunist techniques, which were being used against captured American soldiersand airmen. Two army psychologists named Wolfe and Hinckle sent a memo to AllanDulles in 1953, which spoke of the legendary Communist brainwashing techniques.The findings were that they used no drugs or machines; rather they relied onsleep deprivation, isolation and sensory deprivation. This was combined withsessions of merciless interrogation, in which it was claimed that the prisonerknew their crime and could only end their suffering by giving a full confession.The reinforcement that they are completely alone, plus the over stimulation ofsenses with looped continuous sounds and the forced maintenance of stresspositions, wearies the muscles of the prisoner and slowly breaks down theirresolve. After four to six weeks of this torture, the prisoner realizes he hasto escape and cracks, confessing to any and all crimes put before him. He isthen, as a reward for his confession, sent to a work camp or executed. Chinesemethods also included putting the prisoner with rabid Communist supporters thathated any deviation from the Communist manifesto and would punish this withviolence. Only with conformity is the prisoner accepted and is thereforeforcefully socialized. At this point, an interesting aside is that thesetechniques are used daily by the U.S.A. and U.K. in Guantanamo Bay and otherextraordinary rendition sites and military prisons scattered across the globe. An account of these techniques being used a lot closer to home was given byProfessor Robert Daly in 1976. Professor Daly is an expert in the effects ofsensory deprivation and a graduate of Dublin University. He became an Instructorin Psychiatry at the University of North Carolina and later, a lecturer atEdinburgh University, before taking a position at the University College, Cork.He reported in New Scientist magazine in 1976, “The British government, on 9 August 1971, unleashed one of its largest deepinterrogation experiments. Irish internees were made to stand with hoods overtheir heads while electronic noise was played through speakers or headphones.They were naked, half-starved, and abused.” Being awakened in the middle of thenight, being beaten, lied to, and insulted, was all part of the ‘unfreezingprocess’ through which psychological defences were broken down, and terror andhumiliation were induced. Hence, the photographing in the nude, being forced tourinate while running, the sadism and abuse. The aim of the treatment was tocause temporary insanity, a severe psychological injury liable to having lastingconsequences.” [19] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn19] “The unprecedented operations in Northern Ireland prompted Amnesty Internationaland the European Court of Human Rights to intervene.”[20][part0000_split_023.html#_edn20] Wolff and Hinckles’ report to Allen Dulles was conducted under the CIA projectQKHILLTOP; “In 1954, the CIA's Project QKHILLTOP was created to study Chinese brainwashing[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainwashing] techniques, and to develop effectivemethods of interrogation. Most of the early studies are believed to have beenperformed by the Cornell University[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University] Medical School's human ecologystudy programs, under the direction of Dr. Harold Wolff. Wolff requested thatthe CIA provide him any information they could find regarding \"threats,coercion, imprisonment, deprivation, humiliation, torture, 'brainwashing','black psychiatry', and hypnosis, or any combination of these, with or withoutchemical agents.\" Following this, Wolff’s research team would then: “...assemble, collate, analyze and assimilate this information and will thenundertake experimental investigations designed to develop new techniques ofoffensive/defensive intelligence use ... Potentially useful secret drugs (andvarious brain damaging [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_damage] procedures)will be similarly tested in order to ascertain the fundamental effect upon humanbrain function and upon the subject's mood ... Where any of the studies involvepotential harm of the subject, we expect the Agency to make available suitablesubjects and a proper place for the performance of the necessaryexperiments.”[21] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn21] Richard Helms, later director of the CIA, boasted that the CIA were years aheadof the Communist methods of brainwashing techniques, so the plot thickens. In1956, the following was written into the United States Congressional Record: \"Reports of the treatment of American prisoners of war in Korea have given riseto several popular misconceptions, of which the most widely publicized is’brainwashing’. The term itself has caught the public imagination and is used,very loosely, to describe any act committed against an individual by theCommunists. Actual ’brainwashing’ is a prolonged psychological process, designedto erase an individual’s past beliefs and concepts and to substitute new ones.It is a highly coercive practice which is irreconcilable with universallyaccepted medical ethics. In the process of ’brainwashing’, the efforts of manyare directed against an individual. To be successful, it requires, among otherthings, that the individual be completely isolated from normal associations andenvironment.\"[22] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn22] The concept that U.S. experiments were merely a response to Communist methods isoften set out as an explanation and a justification for the following years ofresearch. Due to the statements of Richard Helms, experiments at Tavistock andlater, declassified documents, I believe this to be a cover story to excuse themanipulative efforts of the various agencies. Departments within the American army conducted interviews with more than 4,000returning prisoners of the Korean conflict. Robert Jay Lifton, one of thepsychiatrists who conducted the interviews, analyzed them in his 1961 classicbook, Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism. Lifton concluded that theChinese interrogation techniques were merely time-honored methods ofpsychological coercion; isolation, humiliation and the repetition of propaganda.He wrote;“Whilst it is clear that mind manipulating techniques including suppression ofexpression, directed socialisation and good old fashioned fear of violence wereprevalent in communist states the veracity of their techniques as a directthreat against the Western world probably came from a CIA source.” Edward Hunter (1902–1978) was an American journalist, author and admittedintelligence agent. In 1951, Hunter published the book Brainwashing in RedChina, which popularised the concept of the evils of Communist mind control.Even the term ‘brainwashing’ was first popularized by Hunter; his translation ofa Chinese term ‘hsi-nao’, meaning roughly, ‘cleansing of the mind’.In March 1958, Hunter was called to testify before the United States House ofRepresentatives' House Committee on Un-American Activities, in which hedescribed his illustrious journalistic career. During this testimony, Hunteradmitted serving for two years during World War II as a \"propaganda specialist\"for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the CIA.Hunter’s journalistic work often took him to various conflicts across the globe.He travelled through Japan and China from the mid-1920s to mid-1930s (the timeof the Japanese detachment of Manchukuo from China) and covered the SecondItalo-Abyssinian War between Italy and Ethiopia. During these excursions Huntermade certain to take note of the psychological warfare methods used by all sidesof the mêlée. His studies proved invaluable and lead to the publishing of asecond book on the subject, Brainwashing; the story of men who defied it,released in 1956. The book contained this description:\"Brainwashing is a system of befogging the brain so a person can be seduced intoacceptance of what otherwise would be abhorrent to him. He loses touch withreality. Facts and fancy whirl round and change places.... However, in order toprevent people from recognizing the inherent evils in brainwashing, the Redspretend that it is only another name for something already very familiar and ofunquestioned respect, such as education or reform.\" [23][part0000_split_023.html#_edn23]Hunter clarified his beliefs in the nature of coercion;\"Brainwashing was made up of two processes. One is the conditioning, orsoftening-up, process primarily for control purposes. The other is anindoctrination or persuasion process for conversion purposes.\"[24][part0000_split_023.html#_edn24]\"It is practically impossible to fight something until it has been given aname\", Hunter wrote, stating that the term ‘brainwashing’ had a more“flesh-and-blood\" quality than the rather clinical alternative, ‘menticide,’which means murder of the mind.The fear of brainwashing was rooted in wartime, fueled by anti-Communist fervorand tinged with racism and xenophobia. Some U.S. prisoners of war in Korearenounced their citizenship in radio broadcasts and many signed confessions ofAmerican crimes, including charges, still debated today, that the United Stateswere engaged in germ warfare with atomised anthrax. Another famous instance offoreign ‘mind control’ that was presented as a justification of the wests’ forayinto the arena of manipulation, were the show trials of Russia held in the1930’s and specifically, the 1949 trial of Hungarian Catholic Cardinal JosefMindszenty. The show trials had seen droves of Communist leaders openlyconfessing to treasonous crimes that they almost certainly did not commit.Reporters of the event claimed the participants appeared to be drugged. At thetrial of Cardinal Mindszenty for his opposition to Communism, it was documentedthat he moved and spoke in an unnatural, robotic fashion, willingly confessingto all charges put before him: “As some of the former high-ranking C.I.A. men recall now, they had looked intothe vacant eyes of Joseph Cardinal Mindszenty at his treason trial in Budapestin 1949 and had been horrified.They had been convinced that his confession had been wrung from him while he waseither under the influence of some mysterious mind-bending drug or that he wasstanding before the dock in a post-hypnotic trance. The sight touched offmemories of earlier \"show trials\" in the Soviet Union. The C.I.A. leaders were certain the Communists had embarked on a campaign tocontrol men's minds and they were determined to find a defence, setting out inearnest the next year—1950—with Project Bluebird, which evolved into ProjectArtichoke, then became MK-ULTRA - MK-DELTA. With each code name change, theybroadened their sweep, until there remained virtually no avenue of humanbehaviour control they were not exploring.”[25] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn25] Regardless, the public perception was set that this exotic, new foreign sciencewas a real threat and any response by the West was a required and sensiblecounter measure to the evils of those who would do us harm. This excuse isnearly always the justification when any level of experimentation ormanipulation is needed to shape public opinion. This is further achieved byutilising the techniques of Tavistock, namely, using fear to counter anycritical analysis of the authority figures who, in the public’s opinion, willsave us from this terrifying exterior threat. Mind control experiments were also an interest to the Germans in their race tobecome the greatest scientific entity on the planet. In Nazi Germany, JosephMengele and others used trauma to shatter and dissociate the minds of many ofthe thousands of captive ‘guinea pigs’ he oversaw at the various concentrationcamps scattered throughout Europe. It has been rumoured, but never conclusivelyproven, that Mengele was one of those chosen for special consideration inOperation Paperclip and several researchers have made the suggestion that hispseudonym was ‘Dr. Green’. A Dr. Green is mentioned by alleged survivors of MKULTRA; whether this is Mengele or not is not clear. Dr. Josef Mengele was born on 16 March 1911 in Günzburg[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCnzburg], Bavaria, the eldest of three sonsto Karl and Walburga Mengele. Josef has been described as refined, intelligentand popular in his home town. He studied philosophy at the University of Munichand medicine at Frankfurt University, earning a Ph.D in Anthropology in 1935.His dissertation dealt with racial differences in the structure of the lowerjaw. In January 1937, Mengele was at the Institute for Hereditary Biology andRacial Hygiene in Frankfurt [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt]. He becamethe assistant to Dr. Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otmar_Freiherr_von_Verschuer] who was at the timeconsidered a leading scientist, known mostly for his research in genetics, witha particular interest in twins. Later that same year Mengele joined the NaziParty [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party] and in 1938 he received hismedical degree and rose in the ranks of the SS[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel]. Mengele was conscripted into the army [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht]in 1940 and later volunteered to the medical service of the Waffen-SS[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffen-SS], the combat arm of the SS, where hedistinguished himself as a soldier. In 1942 he was wounded at the Russian frontand was pronounced unfit for duty. Following this, he volunteered to take amedical role in concentration camps and was sent to Auschwitz. On 24 May 1943,Mengele was awarded the position of medical officer of Auschwitz-Birkenau'sRomani [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people] camp. In August 1944, thiscamp was ‘liquidated’ and Mengele became Chief Medical Officer of the maininfirmary [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital] camp at Birkenau, a positionthat came with a ready supply of human resources available for experimentation. With an understanding of the basic principles of the mind’s defence mechanisms,Mengele and others allegedly utilized trauma to cause prisoners minds tofragment. The premise is actually quite simple, although the application is not.For example, when in a car crash, the victim may find that they cannot actuallyremember the specific moments of the crash itself. This is not because theperson physically blacked out and lost consciousness, but rather due to themechanisms of the brain protecting the person, blanking out the trauma toprevent them from vividly reliving it again and again. This premise was understood in the U.K. in the late 1920’s due to theexperimentation of the Tavistock Institute on shell-shocked soldiers, the resultof which was often a tendency to dissociate or to create amnesic barriers withinthe mind. This can be applied repeatedly until the mind is shattered and splitinto dozens of separate sections like a honeycomb. This in turn can bemanipulated so that each separate closed off section could be moulded intobelieving it is a separate whole personality, the core personality, unaware ofthe other pieces of the shattered mind. This is how ‘alters’ or dissociatedidentities can be formed. In essence, you can have as many separatepersonalities, with their own memories and life story, as you deem fit. Thepersonalities may not know the others exist and these can be completelyundetectable to the subject. The key to this is the use of extreme trauma,simulating the physical response to psychic traumatisation that was seen in WWIsoldiers. Mengele often forced twins kill their sibling in order to induce this damage.The ordeal was so severe that survivors developed a condition called ‘traumabonding’. This is a type of Stockholm syndrome, where the abused love theirabuser and are incredibly loyal to them. Today, some survivors remember him as‘beautiful Joseph’. “Besides using the pseudonym of Dr. Green, survivors knew him as Vaterchen(daddy), Schoner Josef (beautiful Joseph), David and Fairchild. A gracefullyhandsome man of slight stature, Mengele would disarm people with his gentledemeanour, while at other times; he would explode into violent rages.”[26][part0000_split_023.html#_edn26] This may seem unlikely, but, by repeatedly abusing someone, you can destroy theego to the point where they feel responsible for all the negative factors intheir life. This can be seen in the relationship between pimps and their girlsor in violent, abusive relationships where the battered spouse continuallydefends their partner. Other than the shattered ego, there is also the very realknowledge that the tormentor could at any time kill the abused. On asubconscious level, the abused feels grateful to their abuser when they do notkill them, regardless of the severity of the mistreatment. The use of the name‘Daddy’ also would invoke the concept of an all-knowing authoritarian and apotential saviour from the hell of the subject’s existence, even though they arethe principal cause of it. The website prostituteresearch.com confirms this by stating; “The answer to the question \"why do prostitutes stay with their pimps?\" is thesame as the answer to the question \"why do battered women stay with theirbatterers?\"[27] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn27] Additional sources reiterate this point; “Humans bond emotionally to their abusers as a psychological strategy to surviveunder conditions of captivity. This has been described as the Stockholmsyndrome.” [28] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn28] Describing the trauma of prostitution, and its consequences, one fourteen yearold explained, \"You feel like a piece of hamburger meat – all chopped up andbarely holding together.”[29] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn29] Descriptions of Mengele’s techniques hint at the traumatic stripping away of theego that was endured at his hands; “Other characteristics remembered by survivors were the cadence of his shinyblack boots as he paced back and forth and his I-love-you/l-love-you-not” daisygame. When he pulled off the last daisy petal, he would maliciously torture andkill a small child in front of the other child he was programming. Distraughtsurvivors also recalled being thrown naked into cages with monkeys, who weretrained to viciously abuse them. Evidently, Mengele enjoyed reducing people tothe level of animals. He also would purposely restrain his victims from crying,screaming, or showing any excessive emotion.”[30][part0000_split_023.html#_edn30] Other than trauma, Mengele also used barbiturate-induced comas, electroshock,mescaline, Thorazine and various other techniques which will become veryfamiliar to you as you learn about the admitted techniques of MK ULTRA doctors. Experiments also took place at the Dachau concentration camp, using mescaline;reportedly the intention being to eliminate the will of the captured orinterrogated soldier. “Mescaline is a quasi-synthetic extract of the peyote cactus, and is verysimilar to LSD in the hallucinations which it produces. Though they did notachieve the degree of success they had desired, the SS interrogators inconjunction with the Dachau doctors were able to extract the most intimatesecrets from the prisoners when the inmates were given very high doses ofmescaline. There were fatal mind control experiments conducted at Auschwitz. Theexperiments there were described by one informant as \"brainwashing withchemicals\". The informant said the Gestapo wasn't satisfied with extractinginformation by torture. \"So the next question was, why don't we do it like theRussians, who have been able to get confessions of guilt at their show trials?\"They tried various barbiturates and morphine derivatives. After prisoners werefed a coffee-like substance, two of them died in the night and others diedlater.The Dachau mescaline experiments were written up in a lengthy report issued bythe U.S. Naval Technical Mission, whose job it was at the conclusion of the warto scour all of Europe for every shred of industrial and scientific materialthat had been produced by the Third Reich. It was as a result of this reportthat the U.S. Navy became interested in mescaline as an interrogation tool.”[31][part0000_split_023.html#_edn31] Sodium fluoride was also used in the water supply to befuddle and sedate theprisoners at both Nazi concentration camps and Soviet gulags. Fluoride is themain ingredient found in rat poison, Prozac and toothpaste. “Fluoride is a waste by-product of the fertilizer and aluminium industry andit's also a Part II Poison under the UK Poisons Act 1972. USAF Major George R.Jordan testified before Un-American Activity committees of Congress in the1950's that in his post as U.S.-Soviet liaison officer, the Soviets openlyadmitted to \"Using the fluoride in the water supplies in their concentrationcamps, to make the prisoners stupid, docile, and subservient. The first occurrence of fluoridated drinking water on Earth was found inGermany's Nazi prison camps. The Gestapo had little concern about fluoride'ssupposed effect on children's teeth; their alleged reason for mass-medicatingwater with sodium fluoride was to sterilize humans and force the people in theirconcentration camps into calm submission.”[32] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn32] Mengele was captured and then released by the U.S. army in 1946, perhaps due tohis perceived importance in the coming battle for mind manipulation techniques.It has been suggested many times that Mengele was sent by the CIA to continuehis work in Paraguay and Ecuador. “In 1937, Mengele was appointed research assistant at the Third Reich Institutefor Heredity, Biology, and Racial Purity. Mengele provided “experimentalmaterials” to the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology from twins includingeyes, blood, and other body parts from Auschwitz. Mengele fled Auschwitz inJanuary 1945 before the Russians liberated the camp. French government documentsstate that the Americans captured Mengele in 1946. According to the French,Mengele “was released without explanation by the Americans on November 19,1946.” The French claimed that American authorities confirmed the Mengele arrestand release on Feb. 29, 1947.”[33] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn33]Revelations from the Nuremberg trials also lend credence to the concept thatMengele was allowed to go free and was possibly utilised by the Allies;“Mengele’s direct involvement at the infamous Auschwitz concentration camp wassuspiciously downplayed during the Nuremberg Trials and consequently nointensified effort by the U.S. and its allies was directed toward his capture.”[34] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn34]Whilst the official explanation still maintains that the origins of mind controllie in the recesses of the Communist regime, it would appear that certainaspects of the dark science came from the experimentation of certain Nazi’s.Regardless of the actual genesis of the science, what is clear is thatgovernments are willing to overlook the political background of experiments ifthe results are sufficiently productive."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE: LSD AND MK ULTRA Although the application of trauma was effective, in order to gain a moremeasured control and response to stimuli, the CIA were far more interested inthe use of drugs and hypnotic suggestion. Drugs such as LSD were seen as apotential weapon due to their hallucinatory and perception altering effects. In1951, the CIA allegedly released a cloud of high grade LSD into the air of theFrench town of Pont Saint Esprit. This resulted in days of mass insanity,hallucinations and several deaths. This was blamed on the fabulous psychedelicproperties of a range of mouldy local bread by the majority of the media,although the suggestion that the CIA was involved, in what would have been anunprovoked attack on the civilians of a nation state, has always floatedominously on the horizon of these events. An undated document entitled D-Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD-25) stated: “Some of the more outstanding effects are the mental confusion, helplessness,and extreme anxiety which are produced by minute doses of this substance. Basedupon these reactions, its potential use in offensive psychological warfare andin interrogation is considerable. It may become one of the most importantpsychochemical agents.” The psychedelic drug [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug] LSD[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide] was first synthesizedby the Swiss [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland] chemist Albert Hofmann[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Hofmann] in the Sandoz[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandoz] (now Novartis[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novartis]) laboratories in Basel, Switzerland on16 November 1938. It was not until five years later on 16 April 1943, that thepowerful psychedelic properties of the drug were discovered. The main intention of the original LSD synthesis was to obtain a respiratory andcirculatory stimulant known as an analeptic[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analeptic]. While re-synthesizing LSD five yearslater, after deciding to revisit his previous experiment, Hofmann accidentallyabsorbed a small amount of the drug through his fingertips and serendipitouslydiscovered its powerful psychedelic effects. He described the effects: “... affected by a remarkable restlessness, combined with a slight dizziness. Athome I lay down and sank into a not unpleasant intoxicated-like condition,characterized by an extremely stimulated imagination. In a dreamlike state, witheyes closed (I found the daylight to be unpleasantly glaring), I perceived anuninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense,kaleidoscopic [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope] play of colors. Aftersome two hours this condition faded away.” Three days later, on 19 April 1943, Hofmann performed an ill-advised experimenton himself in order to determine the true effects of LSD. Hofmann intentionallyingested 0.25 milligrams (or 250 micrograms) of pure LSD, an amount which he hadpredicted to be a threshold dose[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose-response_relationship]. An actual thresholddose of LSD is considered 20 micrograms, meaning the amount Hofmann consumedconstituted more than ten strong hits. Less than an hour after administeringthis herculean dose, Hofmann experienced sudden and intense changes in hisperceptions. He asked his laboratory assistant to escort him home and, as use ofmotor vehicles was prohibited because of wartime restrictions, he far moresensibly decided to make the journey on a bicycle. Those who participate inrecreational LSD have since named this fateful date ‘Bicycle Day’ and oftencelebrate the anniversary with the drug. On this psychedelic journey, which wecan only assume was at least difficult, Hofmann’s condition rapidly began todeteriorate. His mind raced with powerful feelings of anxiety, truly believingthat his next-door neighbor was a malevolent witch and that as the result ofthis he was going insane. His fears spiraled as he began to believe that thedose of LSD had mortally poisoned him. When a doctor arrived to tend to the wildly tripping Hofmann, he could detect nophysical abnormalities. The only symptom he recorded was a set of hugely dilatedpupils. Hofmann was calmed by soothing conversation with the doctor and soon hisabject terror changed to an exquisite euphoria, as he later wrote; \"... little by little I could begin to enjoy the unprecedented colors and playsof shapes that persisted behind my closed eyes. Kaleidoscopic, fantastic imagessurged in on me, alternating, variegated, opening and then closing themselves incircles and spirals, exploding in colored fountains, rearranging and hybridizingthemselves in constant flux ...” In 1947, as the CIA was taking its fledgling steps, the U.S. Navy began itsmescaline studies under the sponsorship of Project CHATTER. The same year, thefirst report on LSD appeared in a Swiss pharmacological journal. Two yearslater, Dr. Max Rinkel brought LSD to the United States from SandozPharmaceuticals in Switzerland and initiated work with the chemical in Boston.Soon after, Nick Bercel commenced LSD study in Los Angeles. In 1953, as the MK ULTRA project was beginning to establish itself, Dr. HumphreyOsmond began treating alcoholics with LSD. In the same year, the CIA, clearlytaken with this new science, attempted to buy 10 kilograms of LSD from theSandoz laboratories. A single gram contains around ten thousand doses of LSD so,with such a large order, we can assume the agency was trying to corner themarket on what they felt was a game-changing substance. Sandoz informed the CIAthat at that time only 40 grams of LSD had ever been made, due to the difficultyof producing the precursors from ergot mould, and so they would be unable tofulfill the CIA’s request. The CIA then turned to the pharmaceutical company EliLilly to synthetically produce LSD. In 1954, the CIA began Operation MK PILOT at Lexington Narcotics Hospital, whereDr. Harris Isabell would perform his experiments on specifically black heroinaddicts.That same year, Aldous Huxley, who would later spearhead Tavistock’s LSDexperiments in the Haight-Ashbury area, had his book Doors of Perceptionpublished. The Doors rock group would take their name from the title of thistext. In mid-1954, the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly succeeded in synthesizingLSD at the CIA's behest. This gave the agency a limitless and relativelyinexpensive supply and removed the necessity for Sandoz to provide theirstockpiles. A year later, Aldous Huxley experienced his first LSD trip andpublished his essay Heaven and Hell. The essay discussed the relationshipbetween bright, colorful objects, geometric designs, psychoactive substances,art and profound experiences. ‘Heaven and Hell’ metaphorically refer to whatHuxley perceived to be two contrary mystical experiences that could potentiallyawait a subject when you go through the \"doors of perception\". In 1961, the U.S. Army initiated the use of LSD in interrogations underOperation Third Chance in Western Europe, however, by 1962, the CIA withdrewofficial support for above-ground LSD research studies. In America, Congresspassed and began to enforce drug safety regulations. In the same year, the FDAdesignated LSD an experimental drug and strictly restricted research. By April1966, Sandoz had officially stopped supplying LSD to research scientists. In a memo describing the purpose of one particular MK ULTRA programme, RichardHelms stated:“We intend to investigate the development of a chemical material which causes areversible, nontoxic aberrant mental state, the specific nature of which can bereasonably well predicted for each individual. This material could potentiallyaid in discrediting individuals, eliciting information, and implantingsuggestions and other forms of mental control.”[35][part0000_split_023.html#_edn35] Richard Helms was born in St David’s, Philadelphia[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAphiladelphia.htm], on 30 March 1913.After graduating from Williams College, Massachusetts, he joined the UnitedPress news agency and in 1936, was sent to Nazi Germany to cover the BerlinOlympic Games. On his return to the United States[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USA.htm], he joined the advertisingdepartment of the Indianapolis Times and two years later, became their nationaladvertising manager. After the bombing of Pearl Harbour[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWpearl.htm], Helms joined the UnitedStates Navy [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWusaN.htm] and transferredin August 1943 to the Office of Strategic Services[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWoss.htm] (OSS), headed by WilliamDonovan [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWdonovanW.htm]. The OSS wasresponsible for collecting and analyzing information about countries at war withthe United States. It also dealt in more exotic avenues, such as organizingguerrilla fighting, sabotage and espionage. After the surrender of Germany[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Germany.htm] in 1945, Helms helpedinterview suspected Nazi [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERnazi.htm] warcriminals. Helms continued working for the OSS and in 1946, was put in charge ofintelligence and counter-intelligence activities in Germany, Austria andSwitzerland. The following year, Helms joined the recently formed CentralIntelligence Agency [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWcia.htm] (CIA). Hisfirst task was to mount a massive covert campaign against the Communist Partyduring the Italian general election. This was highly successful and encouragedPresident Harry S. Truman [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAtruman.htm]to establish the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), an organization instructedto conduct covert anti-Communist operations around the world. In August 1952,OPC and the Office of Special Operations (the espionage division) wereamalgamated to form the Directorate of Plans (DPP). Helms retained the positionof Director of Central Intelligence[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_Central_Intelligence] (DCI) from 1966to 1973. He was the only director to have been convicted of lying to the UnitedStates Congress [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress] overCentral Intelligence Agency[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency] (CIA) undercoveractivities. In 1977, he was prescribed the maximum available fine and received asuspended two-year prison sentence for his crime. The two distinct targets of mind control were stated publicly by CIA DirectorAllan Dulles. Speaking before a national meeting of Princeton alumni in 1953, hediscussed the two fronts in the then-current \"battle for men's minds\": a \"firstfront of mass indoctrination through censorship and propaganda” and a \"secondfront of individual brainwashing and brain changing”. Sidney Gottlieb was born in 1918. He studied chemistry at the CaliforniaInstitute of Technology and after finishing his Ph.D., he joined the CIA. Heworked as a member of the Technical Services Staff and eventually became head ofthe Chemical Division. Despite being born with a club foot, he was an avid andaccomplished dancer. Richard Bissell [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKbissell.htm], head ofthe Directorate for Plans, an organization instructed to conduct covertanti-Communist operations around the world, made full use of Gottlieb'sabilities with chemicals. The Directorate for Plans was responsible for whatbecame known as the CIA's Black Operations. This involved a policy that waslater to become known as Executive Action[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKexecutiveA.htm] (a plan to removeunfriendly foreign leaders from power). In March 1960, President Dwight Eisenhower[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAeisenhower.htm] of the United States[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USA.htm] approved a CIA[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAcia.htm] plan to overthrow Fidel Castro[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/COLDcastroF.htm]. Gottlieb was asked tocome up with proposals that would undermine Castro's popularity with the Cubanpeople. Plans included a scheme to spray a television studio in which he wasabout to appear with aerosolised LSD and contaminating his shoes withradioactive thallium which they believed would cause the hair in his beard tofall out, humiliating him. Richard Bissell [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKbissell.htm] (a CIAagent who also worked on the U2 spy plane and the Bay of Pigs debacle)eventually decided to organize a CIA plot to kill Castro. Gottlieb came up withseveral ideas on how to do this, including insertion of poison into the cigarsCastro was known to smoke. Another scheme involved a conch shell that would beprogrammed to explode when Castro was swimming underwater. Gottlieb also came upwith the idea of planting a poisoned handkerchief in the target’s suit pocket.This method was also unsuccessfully attempted against General Abd al-KarimKassem [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/IRQkassem.htm] of Iraq. Having been unsuccessful in his attempts on Castro’s life, Gottlieb was thenassigned the task of planning the assassination of Patrice Lumumba[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/COLDlumumba.htm] of the Congo[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/COLDcongo.htm]. One of his ideas was touse a lethal biological agent that would be secretly added to a tube oftoothpaste. This may seem like a decidedly poor batting average on the part of Gottlieb,however, the CIA are not in the habit of publicising their more successfulmurder attempts. By 1967, Gottlieb became head of the Technical Services Staff and held the postuntil his retirement in 1972. Before he left, he destroyed some 80% of the CIA'smost damaging files. When Sidney Gottlieb died on 10 March 1999, hundreds ofsecrets died with him. MK ULTRA began officially in 1953. Allan Dulles, director of the CIA, choseSidney Gottlieb to run the Technical Service Division, which would become themain hub of the mind control experimentation. Dulles apparently asked Gottliebto “go and find the answer to mind control”. Initially, the CIA were interestedin poisons, truth serums and hypnotic techniques of control and coercion, in acontinuation of the techniques of interrogation and control attempted by theNazis and Tavistock, all of which was sanctioned by President Eisenhower.Initially within the agency, the TSD was known as the ‘department of potions anddirty tricks’. Early interrogation methods employed by American intelligence agencies usingnarcotics have been revealed; “One technique investigated was connecting a barbiturate[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate] IV[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous] into one arm and an amphetamine[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine] IV[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous] into the other. The barbiturates werereleased into the person first, and as soon as the person began to fall asleep,the amphetamines were released. The person would then begin babblingincoherently, and it was sometimes possible to ask questions and get usefulanswers.”[36] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn36] An article in the 18 February 1979 Wilmington Sunday News Journal exposed thetechniques that were used. The article states: “The ARTICHOKE interrogation was conducted in a safe house in the remotecountryside staffed by security-cleared personnel. It was conducted undermedical cover of a routine physical and psychological assessment. The Subjectwas transported to the safe house in a ‘covert car.’ At the safe house he wasgiven a conventional interrogation and then some whiskey. This was followed bytwo grams of Phenobarbital, which put him to sleep. A lie detector test wasgiven, and the Subject was given intravenous chemicals. Following thechemically-assisted interrogation, the ARTICHOKE techniques were applied inthree stages. A false memory was introduced into the Subject’s mind without hisconscious control. The procedure was repeated again with interrogation added.” The initial remit of MK ULTRA soon grew to be huge. A declassified documentrevealed that the nature of the research conducted under the umbrella term of MKULTRA included these extremely specific goals, showing conclusively the avenuesin which the CIA expected results. “Can we create by post-H (hypnotic) control an action contrary to anindividual’s basic moral principles? Can we “alter” a person’s personality? Canwe guarantee total amnesia under any and all conditions? Could we seize asubject and in the space of an hour by post-H control have him crash anairplane? (Or a car in Paris? Eds note) Can we devise a system for makingunwilling subjects into willing agents and then transfer that control tountrained agency agents in the field by use of codes or identifying signs?” [37][part0000_split_023.html#_edn37] The New York Times explained the hopes of those involved in the experiments, inan exposé article on the history of the CIA. The experimentation was aimed atfinalising techniques that could not only be used on the enemy but also, forreasons of national security, their own loyal agents. \"They wanted to reduce a man to a bewildered, self-doubting mass to \"subvert hisprinciples,\" a C.I.A. document said. They wanted to direct him in ways that \"mayvary from rationalizing a disloyal act to the construction of a new person. One of their longest running goals was to develop a way to induce amnesia. Theywanted to be able to interrogate enemy espionage agents in such a way thatneither the agents nor their superiors would know they had been compromised, andthey wanted to be able to wipe clean the memories of their own agents aftercertain missions and, especially, when they were going into retirement.”[38][part0000_split_023.html#_edn38] In hundreds of experiments, Sidney Gottlieb (head of the Technical ServiceDivision and overall controller of the MK ULTRA projects) personally gave LSD toprison inmates, including mob boss Whitey Bulger, who complained of headaches,hallucinations and nightmares for the rest of his life. Bulger was an extremelyviolent gangster whose personality was immortalised by Jack Nicholson in theMartin Scorcese film The Departed. The psychotic lead character played byNicholson was reportedly based (by Nicholson) on the exploits and personality ofthe mob boss. Was this psychotic nature a result of MK ULTRA experiments? Wasthis psychotic personality the desired result? What better way to impose fear ona population than the occasional celebrity terrorizer, who could also, one mightspeculate, provide a perfect bogeyman for the authorities to protect you from?Bulger complained that he and other inmates believed that they were helping in amedical study to, “find a cure for Schizophrenia”. Bulger also stated, “We wererecruited by deception”.[39] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn39] Gottlieb gave massive doses of hallucinogenic material, without consent, tohundreds of unwitting ‘guinea pigs’. These included fellow agents, doctorsinvolved in the project, prisoners, mental patients, prostitutes and the generalpublic. Sidney Gottlieb admitted in September 1977 that even President Nixon was notimmune to the experimentation of the agency. When travelling abroad on at leastone occasion, Nixon’s entire entourage were secretly drugged. ABC News laterconfirmed that the incident took place in 1972 during Nixon’s visit to theSoviet Union. The CIA was clearly not concerned with the on-going Cold War andfelt that this was an appropriate opportunity to test their cavalcade ofmind-altering chemicals. The timing and geography of this event suggest eitheran incredible arrogance on the part of the CIA, willing to risk any number ofpotentially nuclear diplomatic faux-pas or alternatively, that the CIA knew allalong that the Cold War was itself a fraud, a mind control programme directingthe fear and the profits of the general public into the coffers of the militaryindustrial complex. The fear and uncertainty of the Cold War is also a classicTavistock-esque creator of social turbulence. Several people of varying merit also participated in MK ULTRA mind controlexperiments carried out by the U.S. Government; the influence of theseexperiments on the individuals is debated: “A considerable amount of credible circumstantial evidence[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstantial_evidence] suggests that TheodoreKaczynski [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Kaczynski], also known as theUnabomber, participated in CIA-sponsored MKULTRA experiments conducted atHarvard University [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University] from thefall of 1959 through the spring of 1962. During World War II[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II], Henry Murray[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Murray], the lead researcher in the Harvardexperiments, served with the Office of Strategic Services[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services] (OSS), which was aforerunner of the CIA. Murray applied for a grant funded by the United StatesNavy [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy], and his Harvard stress[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biological)] experiments stronglyresembled those run by the OSS. Beginning at the age of sixteen, Kaczynskiparticipated along with twenty-one other undergraduate students in the Harvardexperiments, which have been described as \"disturbing\" and \"ethicallyindefensible.\"[40] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn40] Also part of the experiments was author and promoter of hippie ideals Ken Kesey; “Merry Prankster [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merry_Pranksters] Ken Kesey[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Kesey], author of One Flew Over the Cuckoo'sNest [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Flew_Over_the_Cuckoo%27s_Nest_(novel)],volunteered for MKULTRA experiments involving LSD and other psychedelic drugs atthe Veterans Administration Hospital[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Administration_Hospital] in Menlo Park[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_Park,_California] while he was a student atnearby Stanford University [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University].Kesey's experiences while under the influence of LSD inspired him to promote thedrug outside the context of the MKULTRA experiments, which influenced the earlydevelopment of hippie [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie] culture.”[41][part0000_split_023.html#_edn41] All of these people in some way affected the shaping of the modern world ineither a positive or negative direction. Of course, military men were not immune to the testing of their masters, certaininstallations providing fruitful crops of young, eager subjects, who, aside fromanything else, were trained to follow orders. “Unethical practice by physicians and the direct involvement of pharmaceuticalcompanies are part of the history of hallucinogens. Under TOP SECRET clearance,Eli Lilly Company was given a $400,000 grant in 1953 to manufacture and supplyLSD to the CIA. Army LSD research was on-going in 1977 when LSD was a controlledsubstance. At least 1,500 soldiers were given LSD without informed consent aspart of Army mind control experiments. These facts have never been subject toethical review or any policy or position statement by any medicalorganization.”[42] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn42] One 1955 MK ULTRA document gives an indication of the size and range of theeffort; this document refers to the study of an assortment of mind-alteringsubstances described as follows: “1.Substances which will promote illogical thinking and impulsiveness to thepoint where the recipient would be discredited in public. 2.Substances which increase the efficiency of mentation and perception. 3.Materials which will prevent or counteract the intoxicating effect of alcohol. 4.Materials which will promote the intoxicating effect of alcohol. 5.Materials which will produce the signs and symptoms of recognized diseases ina reversible way so that they may be used for malingering, etc. 6.Materials which will render the induction of hypnosis easier or otherwiseenhance its usefulness. 7.Substances which will enhance the ability of individuals to withstandprivation, torture and coercion during interrogation and so-called\"brain-washing\". 8.Materials and physical methods which will produce amnesia for events precedingand during their use. 9.Physical methods of producing shock and confusion over extended periods oftime and capable of surreptitious use. 10.Substances which produce physical disablement such as paralysis of the legs,acute anemia, etc. 11.Substances which will produce \"pure\" euphoria with no subsequent let-down. 12.Substances which alter personality structure in such a way that the tendencyof the recipient to become dependent upon another person is enhanced. 13.A material which will cause mental confusion of such a type that theindividual under its influence will find it difficult to maintain a fabricationunder questioning. 14.Substances which will lower the ambition and general working efficiency ofmen when administered in undetectable amounts.15.Substances which promote weakness or distortion of the eyesight or hearingfaculties, preferably without permanent effects. 16.A knockout pill which can surreptitiously be administered in drinks, food,cigarettes, as an aerosol, etc., which will be safe to use, provide a maximum ofamnesia, and be suitable for use by agent types on an ad hoc basis. 17.A material which can be surreptitiously administered by the above routes andwhich in very small amounts will make it impossible for a person to performphysical activity.[43] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn43] Among other experiments authorized by Gottlieb were those of Dr. Harris Isabell,who ran the Centre for Addiction Research in Lexington Kentucky. Isabell would conduct hundreds of racially specific experiments using blackheroin addicts as research fodder, testing more than eight hundred differentpsychoactive chemicals which were all shipped to him directly from SidneyGottlieb. In one such experiment, Dr. Isabell kept seven of these addictscompletely addled with four times the normal dose of LSD without interruptionfor seventy seven days straight, rousing them with electric shocks from cattleprods if the test subjects happened to fall asleep. In another experiment,Isabell strapped nine men to stretchers, inserted rectal thermometers,intravenously doped them up with psilocybin’s, shined lights in their eyes tocheck pupil dilation and pounded on their joints to test the response of thepatients nervous system. The subjects of these tests were paid by the Americangovernment for their hard work in heroin. In 1954 Isabell reported on the results of his experimentation to test theamount of LSD a patient could stand. He wrote:“Our experiments on the tolerance to LSD 25 have been proceeding well, althoughI continue to be somewhat surprised by the results, which to me are to mostamazing demonstration of drug tolerance that I have ever seen. I have sevenpatients who have now been taking the drug for forty two days. All are quitetolerant to both the physiological and mental effects of the drug. We haveattempted to break this tolerance by administering double, triple and quadrupledoses.” Isabell was by no means the only doctor abusing his position in order to testthe new methods of manipulation. \"In the mid-1950's, Paul Hoch, M.D., a man who would become Commissioner ofMental Hygiene for the State of New York, then a labourer in the field for theCIA, gave a 'pseudo neurotic schizophrenic' patient mescaline. The patient had anot-unfamiliar heaven-and-hell journey on the compound. But Hoch followed thisup with a transorbital leucotomy...Hoch also gave a patient LSD, and a localanaesthetic, and then proceeded to remove pieces of cerebral cortex, asking atvarious moments whether the patient's perceptions were changing.\"[44][part0000_split_023.html#_edn44] One notable death connected to the testing of substances in MK ULTRA was Dr.Frank Olsen, an army biological warfare specialist, who was thrown out of awindow after being spiked with a huge dose of LSD. The evidence points to murderrather than death by misadventure, possibly to conceal evidence of illegaltesting. This was raised by Senator Kennedy in 1977 to the U.S. Senate,prompting an investigation into the previously classified project. This is wherethe majority of declassified documents came from, in addition to those madeavailable by John D. Marks under the Freedom of Information Act, although Iwould suggest that these are the tip of the iceberg. Olsen was reportedlylooking into aerosolised weapons deployment and there is a possibility that hewas connected to the Pont Saint Espirit incident or even connected to thespreading of Anthrax and other deadly compounds during the Korean War. It hasalso been suggested that Olsen became ultimately dispirited with his role afterwitnessing the outcome of a failed experiment conducted on foreign prisoners.After the experiment failed to yield any useful results, the test subjects wereunceremoniously executed by a gunshot to the back of the head. The resources hadseemingly outlived their usefulness and this ultimately left a bad taste inOlson’s mouth. “In the C.I.A.'s very first experiment with LSD on a group of unwitting men, oneof them, Dr. Frank Olson, a civilian working on top secret germ warfare in aunit at Fort Detrick, Md., which provided data for both the Army and the C.I.A.,went into a depression that ended in his leap from a 10th-story hotel roomwindow in Manhattan in the fall of 1953. Earlier in the same year, in the first experiment with psychochemicals that theArmy had sponsored at a civilian facility, Harold Blauer, a professional tennisplayer, had been given a fatal dose of mescaline derivative at the New YorkState Psychiatric Institute in Manhattan. The fact that both men died in Government experiments was kept secret from theirfamilies and the general public for more than 20 years. Two years after thedeaths the C.I.A. made an arrangement with the agents of the Bureau of Narcoticsto test LSD surreptitiously on unwitting patrons of bars in New York and SanFrancisco, some of whom became violently ill and were hospitalized, neverknowing exactly what had happened to them.”[45] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn45] On 19 November 1953, Frank Olson, who was working on an MK ULTRA project, was,without his knowledge or consent, slipped a large dose of LSD in a drink at aparty attended by other CIA personnel. For weeks afterward he remained in whatmany witnesses described as a state of depression and paranoia. He confided toone CIA doctor that the agency was putting something in his coffee to keep himawake at night, that people were plotting against him and that he heard voicescommanding him to throw his wallet away, which dutifully he did, even though itcontained several valuable un-cashed pay checks. On the last night of his life,he checked into a room at the Statler Hilton hotel in New York City along with aCIA agent assigned to watch him. Olson allegedly jumped through a closed hotelwindow and fell ten stories to his death. It was Dr. Gottlieb who had slippedhim the drug at the party. On the Senate floor in 1977, Senator Ted Kennedy[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kennedy] said: “The Deputy Director of the CIA revealed that over thirty universities andinstitutions were involved in an \"extensive testing and experimentation\" programwhich included covert drug tests on unwitting citizens \"at all social levels,high and low, native Americans and foreign.\" Several of these tests involved theadministration of LSD [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide]to \"unwitting subjects in social situations.\"[46][part0000_split_023.html#_edn46] More and more evidence of testing on unwitting subjects, including civilians,came out as the investigations progressed. “Some 2 years ago, the Senate Health Subcommittee heard chilling testimony aboutthe human experimentation activities of the CIA. The Deputy Director of the CIArevealed that over 30 universities and institutions were involved in an“extensive testing and experimentation” program which included covert drug testson unwitting citizens “at all social levels, high and low, native Americans andforeign.” Several of these tests involved the administration of LSD to“unwitting subjects in social situations.” [47] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn47] The Senate Intelligence Committee concluded in 1976 that the CIA usedcompartmentalisation in the MK ULTRA programme to conceal their “unethical andillicit activities”. Senator Church, who led the congressional investigations ofthe CIA’s improper and unlawful actions, said that the agency was; “A rogue elephant” operating above the law and out of control as it plottedassassinations, illegally spied on thousands of Americans, and even druggedcitizens in its effort to develop new weapons for its covert arsenal.” [48][part0000_split_023.html#_edn48] “1n 1977, an important MKULTRA administrator was taken before a Senate hearingto answer important questions about CIA mind control projects. He revealed thatthe CIA had indeed funded a series of such operations. The programs were codenamed MKULTRA, MKACTION, MKNAOMI, ARTICHOKE, and BLUEBIRD, which involved peoplebeing used as guinea pigs in mind experiments. Many subjects lost their sanityand at least two people died.”[49] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn49] The report, which later became known as the Church Committee, made it clear asto why more documentation was not forthcoming; “The Senate’s Church Committee did find some records during its investigation in1976. However it noted that the practice of MKULTRA was “to maintain no recordsof the planning and approval of test programs.” [50][part0000_split_023.html#_edn50] Miles Copeland, a former CIA officer of distinguished rank, said, “Thecongressional sub-committee which went into this got only the barest glimpse”.[51] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn51] MK ULTRA activities continued until 1973 when CIA director Richard Helms[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Helms], fearing that they would be exposedto the public, ordered the project terminated and all of the files destroyed. Anadministration error resulted in many of the documents being sent to the wrongoffice, so when CIA workers were destroying the files, some of them remained andwere later released under a Freedom of Information Act[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act] request byinvestigative journalist [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalist]John Marks. Many people in the American public were outraged when they learnedof the experiments and several congressional investigations took place,including the aforementioned Church Committee[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee] and the Rockefeller Commission[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_President%27s_Commission_on_CIA_activities_within_the_United_States]. “Perhaps most disturbing of all was the fact that the extent of experimentationon human subjects was unknown. The records of all these activities weredestroyed in January 1973, at the instruction of then CIA director RichardHelms. In spite of persistent inquiries by both the Health Subcommittee and theIntelligence Committee, no additional records or information were forthcoming.And no one, no single individual, could be found who remembered the details, notthe Director of the CIA, who ordered the documents destroyed, not the officialresponsible for the program, nor any of his associates.”[52][part0000_split_023.html#_edn52] A surprisingly large number of trusted and seemingly benevolent organisationswere exposed to be involved with the conducting and concealment ofexperimentation: “MKULTRA Subproject 35 involved funding the construction of the Gorman Annex atGeorgetown University Hospital in Washington, DC. The total budget for the Annexof $1.25 million was to provide a hospital safe house for mind control research.One sixth of the space was set aside for the CIA, which placed three biochemiststhere under cover.”[53] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn53] It has been subsequently revealed that at least forty four Americanuniversities, fifteen research foundations, twelve hospitals and three prisonswere involved directly in the conducting of experiments connected to MK ULTRA. “The BLUEBIRD and ARTICHOKE documents available through the Freedom ofInformation Act, like all such documents, are heavily redacted. A great deal oftext has been whited out, and other documents must still be entirely classified.BLUEBIRD and ARTICHOKE were administered in a compartmented fashion. The detailsof the programs were kept secret even form other personnel within the CIA. Whenasked why LSD research done under ARTICHOKE was hidden from the CIA Committee incharge of ARTICHOKE, Sydney Gottlieb, Chief, Medical Staff, Technical ServicesDivision, CIA, responded, “I imagine the only reason would have been concern forbroadening awareness of its existence.”[54] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn54]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR: CIVILIAN TESTING The methods of using unsuspecting civilians for military testing purposes iscertainly nothing new and is by no means exclusive to MK ULTRA. The powers thatbe often do not have your best interests at heart. This list is not exhaustivebut gives many examples of U.S. government testing on civilians: Recorded in 1931, Dr. Cornelius Rhoads infected human subjects with cancer cellsunder the auspices of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Investigations;Rhoads later conducted radiation exposure experiments on American soldiers andcivilian hospital patients. In 1932, the Tuskegee Syphilis Study began on 200black men; they weren't told of their illness, were denied treatment, and wereused as human guinea pigs to follow their disease symptoms and progression; theyall subsequently died. In 1940 four hundred prisoners from prisons in Chicago were infected withmalaria to study the effects of new and experimental drugs. From 1942 to 1945,the U.S. Navy used human subjects (locked in air tight chambers) to test gasmasks and clothing. In 1945 the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) implemented‘Program F’, the most exhaustive American study of fluoride's health effects - akey component in atomic bomb production and one of the most toxic chemicalsknown, it causes markedly adverse central nervous system effects; in theinterest of national security, the information was suppressed. In 1947 the AEC'sColonel E. E. Kirkpatrich issued secret document #07075001, stating that theagency would begin administering intravenous doses of radioactive substances tohuman subjects. In 1949 the U.S. Army released biological agents in U.S. citiesto study the effects of a real germ warfare attack; tests continued secretlythrough to at least the 1960’s, in San Francisco, New York, Washington DC,Panama City and Key West, FL, Minnesota, other Midwest locations, along thePennsylvania turnpike and elsewhere. Since the 1940’s, human radiation experiments have been conducted to test itseffects and determine how much can kill; unwitting subjects were used inprisons, hospitals, orphanages, and mental institutions, including men, women,children and the unborn of all races, mostly people from lower socio-economicbrackets; in addition, more than 200,000 U.S. soldiers were exposed to aboveground nuclear tests; many later became ill and died.In 1950 the Department of Defense (DOD) began open-air testing of nuclearweapons in desert areas, then covertly monitored downwind residents for medicalproblems and mortality rates. In 1951 African-Americans were exposed topotentially fatal stimulants as part of a race-specific fungal weapons test inVirginia.In 1953 DOD released a cloud of zinc cadmium sulfide gas over Winnipeg, St.Louis, Minneapolis, Fort Wayne, the Monocacy River Valley, MD, and Leesburg, VAto determine how efficiently chemical agents can be dispersed. That same year,joint Army-Navy-CIA experiments were conducted in New York and San Francisco,exposing tens of thousands of people to the airborne agents Serratia marcescensand Bacillus glogigii. In 1955 the CIA released bacteria from the Army's Tampa,FL biological warfare arsenal, to test its ability to infect human populations.In 1956 the U.S. military released mosquitoes infected with Yellow Fever overSavannah, GA and Avon Park, FL to test the health effects on humans. Testing did not stop there. In 1965 at Homesburg State Prison, Philadelphia,prisoners were subjected to testing with the highly toxic Agent Orange anddioxins, to determine their carcinogenic effects. In 1966 the New York subwaysystem was used for a germ warfare experiment and the public were unsurprisinglynot informed.In 1970 the Military Review reported that ‘ethnic weapons’ development wasintensified to be able to target specific ethnic groups thought susceptible togenetic differences and DNA variations. In 1976 Americans were warned about anearlier Swine Flu scare, urging everyone to be vaccinated and millions complied,many of whom were harmed; five hundred cases of the deadly nerve disorderGuillan-Barre Syndrome (GBS) resulted. People died from respiratory failureafter severe paralysis and experts said the vaccine increased the GBS risk leveleight-fold.Skipping forward to 1990, over 1,500 six-month old Los Angeles black andHispanic babies were given an experimental measles vaccine, the parents neverinformed of the potential harm. In 1990 and 1991, before deploying to the GulfWar, all U.S. troops were inoculated with experimental anthrax and botulinumtoxoid vaccines, even though concerns were raised about their adverse long-termeffects; over 12,000 died and over 30% became ill from non-combat-relatedfactors in what subsequently was called Gulf War Syndrome, the result ofexposure to a variety of toxins. In 1994 U.S. Senator Jay Rockefeller issued areport revealing that for at least the past fifty years, the DOD had usedhundreds of thousands of U.S. military personnel, exposing them to dangeroussubstances experimentally; materials included mustard and nerve gas, ionizingradiation, psychochemicals, hallucinogens and other drugs. In 1995 Dr. GarthNicolson discovered that toxic agents used during the Gulf War were pre-testedon Texas Department of Corrections prisoners. In 1996, the U.S. Department ofDefense finally admitted that Gulf War troops were exposed to chemical agents. Chemical testing on the general public was also not uncommon in the U.K.. TheObserver article “Millions were in germ war tests” seems to confirm this:“The Ministry of Defence turned large parts of the country into a giantlaboratory to conduct a series of secret germ warfare tests on the public. A government report just released provides for the first time a comprehensiveofficial history of Britain's biological weapons trials between 1940 and 1979. Many of these tests involved releasing potentially dangerous chemicals andmicro-organisms over vast swaths of the population without the public beingtold. The report reveals that military personnel were briefed to tell any 'inquisitiveinquirer' the trials were part of research projects into weather and airpollution. The tests, carried out by government scientists at Porton Down, were designed tohelp the MoD assess Britain's vulnerability if the Russians were to havereleased clouds of deadly germs over the country.”[55][part0000_split_023.html#_edn55] The testing was conducted as part of military research: “One chapter of the report, 'The Fluorescent Particle Trials', reveals howbetween 1955 and 1963 planes flew from north-east England to the tip of Cornwallalong the south and west coasts, dropping huge amounts of zinc cadmium sulphideon the population. The chemical drifted miles inland, its fluorescence allowingthe spread to be monitored. In another trial using zinc cadmium sulphide, agenerator was towed along a road near Frome in Somerset where it spewed thechemical for an hour. While the Government has insisted the chemical is safe, cadmium is recognised asa cause of lung cancer and during the Second World War was considered by theAllies as a chemical weapon. In another chapter, 'Large Area Coverage Trials', the MoD describes how between1961 and 1968 more than a million people along the south coast of England, fromTorquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli andbacillus globigii , which mimics anthrax. These releases came from a militaryship, the Icewhale, anchored off the Dorset coast, which sprayed themicro-organisms in a five to 10-mile radius.”[56][part0000_split_023.html#_edn56] Operation Midnight Climax, which shows at least a hint of a sense of humour inthe designating of project names, set up a fake brothel and then drugged andfilmed its unwitting customers. Those who discovered this and consented weregiven far higher doses. One man was given LSD for seventy seven days straight.These sessions were viewed by Agent George White who sat on a portable toilet,drink in hand, watching the hapless johns through a two way mirror. White was anotorious drinker, reportedly going through a bottle or more of gin nightly onthe seat of his toilet, noting down all that he saw. He was involved in thesearch for truth serums before the official start of MK ULTRA. He experimentedwith truth drugs at St Elizabeth’s hospital in Washington DC, using mescaline,scopolamine and marijuana on unsuspecting test subjects. White gave LSD the petname ‘Stormy’ due to the insane behaviour it caused. George Hunter White isreported to have continued operating his Telegraph Hill LSD brothel until heretired from the service. Upon his death, White’s widow gifted the Electronic Museum at Foothills JuniorCollege, forty miles south of San Francisco, with his diaries. According to aWashington Post article dated 05 September 1977 these diaries: “provide documentary evidence that White met to discuss drugs and safe houseswith such CIA luminaries as Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, head of the Chemical Divisionof the Technical Services Division and the man who ran MK-ULTRA, and Dr. RobertV. Lashbrook, a CIA chemist who worked with LSD. Other high-ranking CIAofficials mentioned prominently include James Angleton, C. P. Cabell and StanleyLovell. Gottlieb and Lashbrook have been subpoenaed to testify Sept. 20 (1977)before a Senate subcommittee investigating the MK-ULTRA project.” White detailed in his diary how he enjoyed slipping doses of acid tounsuspecting civilians at local beaches, city bars and restaurants. Upon retirement, George Hunter White wrote to Harry Anslinger, his old boss atthe Federal Bureau of Narcotics, reflecting on his many years of service: “I was a very minor missionary, actually a heretic, but I toiled wholeheartedlyin the vineyards because it was fun, fun, fun. Where else could a red-bloodedAmerican boy lie, kill, cheat, steal, rape, and pillage with the sanction andblessing of the All-Highest?”[57] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn57] “Operation Midnight Climax[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Midnight_Climax], consisted of a web ofCIA-run safe houses in San Francisco, Marin, and New York which were establishedin order to study the effects of LSD on unconsenting individuals. Prostitutes onthe CIA payroll were instructed to lure clients back to the safe houses, wherethey were surreptitiously plied with a wide range of substances, including LSD,and monitored behind one-way glass. Several significant operational techniqueswere developed in this theater, including extensive research into sexualblackmail, surveillance technology, and the possible use of mind-altering drugsin field operations.”[58] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn58] Richard Stratton interviewed George White’s last living Operation MidnightClimax associate for Spin Magazine in 1994. According to White’s lieutenant Ira‘Ike’ Feldman: “White was a son of a bitch, but he was a great cop. He made that fruitcakeHoover look like Nancy Drew. The LSD, that was just the tip of the iceberg.Write this down. Espionage, assassinations, dirty tricks, drug experiments,sexual encounters and the study of prostitutes for clandestine use. That’s whatI was doing when I worked for George White and the CIA.” George White was also infamous for a particular skill that he had perfected,namely assassination. His particular method was a single powerful closed fist tothe back of the skull, behind the ear, causing a small hole to literally punchthrough the bone, killing the victim. By strange coincidence, senior biochemistFrank Olson died of injuries remarkably similar to those delivered by White whenhe exited the window of his hotel. George White was in the same hotel as Olsonwhen he died and several researchers believe him to be the true guilty party inthis nefarious event. A CIA memo dated 1952, which officially predates the start of MK ULTRA, statesthat the goal of brainwashing experiments is “controlling an individual to thepoint where he will do our bidding against his will”. The CIA were fully aware of the illegal, unethical and immoral nature of theirtesting: Written on 26 July 1963, the Memorandum For: Director of Central IntelligenceFrom: CIA Inspector General describes the agency’s attitude. “The concepts involved in manipulating behaviour are found by many people bothwithin and outside the Agency [CIA] to be distasteful and unethical.Nevertheless, there have been major accomplishments both in research andoperational employment. Over the ten-year life of the program many additionalavenues to the control of human behaviour have been designated under the MKULTRAcharter, including radiation, electro-shock, and harassment substances. Someactivities raise questions of legality implicit in the original charter. A finalphase of the testing places the rights and interests of US citizens injeopardy.” Regardless of a report by the CIA’s Inspector General in 1963, recommending thetermination of testing on unwitting subjects, DCI Richard Helms continued toadvocate covert testing on the grounds that, “We are less capable of staying up with the Soviet advances in this field.” Onthe subject of moral issues, Helms commented, “we have no answer to the moralissue”.[59] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn59] CIA deputy Director Richard Helms[http://www.sfweekly.com/related/to/Richard+Helms] wrote in response to concernsfrom within the agency: \"While I share your uneasiness and distaste for any program which tends tointrude upon an individual's private and legal prerogatives, I believe it isnecessary that the Agency maintain a central role in this activity\" In another CIA report quoted in a New York Times article, it is stated: \"Many phases of the research in the control of human behaviour involve a highdegree of sensitivity. The professional reputations of outside researchers arein jeopardy since the objectives of such research are widely regarded asanti-ethical or illegal\"[60] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn60] Also published in the same article was the statement: \"Evolution and development of any method by which we can get information from aperson against his will and without his knowledge... Can we get control of anindividual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and evenagainst such fundamental laws of nature such as self-preservation?\"[61][part0000_split_023.html#_edn61] The Technical Services Division initiated a programme for covert testing ofmaterials on unwitting U.S. citizens in 1955, however the full extent may neverbe known as the TSD has pursued a philosophy of minimum documentation in keepingwith the high sensitivity of the projects. Some files contained little or nodata at all. There were just two individuals in TSD who had full knowledge ofthe MK ULTRA programme at any time. A memorandum from Richard Helms, acting deputy director to Allen Dulles,director of the CIA dated 3 April 1953 and entitled Two Extremely SensitiveResearch Programs (clearly referring to MK ULTRA and MK DELTA), included thestatement, “Even internally in CIA, as few individuals as possible should be aware of ourinterest in these fields and of the identity of those who are working for us. Atpresent this results in ridiculous contracts, often with cut-outs [frontorganizations], which do not spell out the scope or intent of the work. CompleteGovernment audits of such contracts are impossible for the same reason.”[62][part0000_split_023.html#_edn62] In order to achieve this, experimentation was often hidden by conducting it onthose out of sight of the general public. “From 1964 to 1968, the U.S. Army paid $386,486 to professors Albert Kligman andHerbert W. Copelan to perform experiments with mind-altering drugs on 320inmates of Holmesburg Prison [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmesburg_Prison].The goal of the study was to determine the minimum effective dose of each drugneeded to disable 50 percent of any given population. Kligman and Copelaninitially claimed that they were unaware of any long-term health effects thedrugs could have on prisoners, however, documents later revealed that this wasnot the case.”[63] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn63] In 1963 a CIA Inspector General’s report on MK ULTRA stated that the program was“concerned with research and development of chemical, biological, andradiological materials capable of employment in clandestine operations tocontrol human behaviour” and that radiation was one of the additional “avenuesto control the human behaviour”. This was stated in document; CIA MORI ID 17748,pp. 1, 6. Report of the Inspection of MKULTRA/TSD, 26 July 1963. MK ULTRA was able to achieve such a broad spectrum of experimentation due to thesecretive manner in which the project was administrated. It was incrediblycompartmentalised with at least 149 sub projects. In 1978 Admiral StansfieldTurner, director of the CIA, testified that 140 of these subprojects appeared tohave a connection with research into behavioural modification, drug acquisitionand testing or administering drugs surreptitiously. For example, Subproject 54Perfect Concussion used sub-aural frequencies to induce amnesia and erase memoryat a distance. The U.S. General Accounting Office issued a report on 28 September 1994, whichstated that between 1940 and 1974, DOD and other national security agenciesstudied thousands of human subjects in tests and experiments involving hazardoussubstances. A quote from the study: “... Working with the CIA, the Department of Defense gave hallucinogenic drugsto thousands of \"volunteer\" soldiers in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition to LSD,the Army also tested quinuclidinyl benzilate[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-Quinuclidinyl_benzilate], a hallucinogencode-named BZ [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-quinuclidinyl_benzilate]. (Note37) Many of these tests were conducted under the so-called MKULTRA program,established to counter perceived Soviet and Chinese advances in brainwashingtechniques. Between 1953 and 1964, the program consisted of 149 projectsinvolving drug testing and other studies on unwitting human subjects...” [64][part0000_split_023.html#_edn64] Subproject 86 proposed “artificial means of establishing positiveidentification” (known as covert marking) involving ionizing radiation implantedor injected into predetermined sites in the human body.[65][part0000_split_023.html#_edn65] At least four MK ULTRA projects were specifically conducted on children. Theseprogrammes were officially socialisation experiments such as testing theresponse of a group of children to a rich, confident child’s arrival. Asdetailed in BLUEBIRD Deliberate Creation of Multiple Personality byPsychiatrists by Colin Ross; “The four MK ULTRA Subprojects on children were seemingly benign and did notinvolve unethical experiments. Subproject 102 was conducted by Muzafer Sherif ofthe University of Oklahoma. It involved studies of social processes in teenagegangs in two cities. Subjects were 14 to 17 years of age and were studied byhaving social science students \"hang out\" with them. One student showed up at abasketball court with a new basketball and explained that he wanted to exerciseto lose some weight. Observations were made about how group cohesiveness wasmaintained, how members were selected, status ranking of members, behaviouralsanctions within the group, and similar matters. The CIA's interest in thisSubproject is not stated in the documents, but one can assume it was relevant tounderstanding and manipulating social groups during psychological warfare andpropaganda operations. Subproject 103 was conducted by Robert Cormack and A.B.Kristofferson at the Children's International Summer Villages, Inc. in Maine.The subjects were 16 to 21 years of age and were there for a reunion; all hadattended the camp in previous years as 11-year olds. The academic purpose of theproject was to study how children communicate when they do not share a commonlanguage. The CIA was interested in the project as a cover for establishingrelationships with children from a variety of countries. Obviously, the intentwas to recruit them as agents or assets. A MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD from theSubproject 103 documents dated 10 December 1959 states that; It is felt that this project will support the [whited out] need for cover. Inaddition it will assist in the identification of promising young foreignnationals and U.S. nationals (many of whom are now in their late teens) who mayat any time be of direct interest to the Agency.... No cleared or wittingpersons are concerned with the conduct of this project. The principalinvestigator for MKULTRA Subproject 112 was Melvin DeFleur of the University ofIndiana. He studied perceptions of occupational roles in children from first toeighth grades. According to a MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD dated 24 March 1960, theCIA's \"interest is connected with the current problems of vocational guidancewith possible applications to the selection of technical and scientificcareers.\" The materials for Subproject 117 have gone through many generations ofphotocopying and are very hard to read. The aim of the research was to studypatterns of child discipline in families from a different culture. The CIA'sinterest in this Subproject is not clear but a MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD dated10 May 1960 states that, \"This Subproject was initiated at our request afterconsultation with chief, [whited out].\"”[66] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn66] However, a declassified CIA document dated May 1964 states: “In the children’s unit of the Creedmore State Hospital with a residentpopulation of 450 patients, ages 4 to 15, we have experimented on the responsesof some of these children to LSD and related drugs in the psychiatric,psychological and biochemical areas. Two groups of boys receiving daily LSD, UML(methylated derivative of LSD) and psilocybin…at first the medication was givenweekly but was eventually given daily for periods of up to several months.Dosages remain constant throughout. The average length of treatment was 2 to 3months.” On 16 November 2009, the BBC Radio 4 programme Document had an item on Britain'sbrainwashing[http://www.google.co.uk/url?q=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/uk_news/8361655.stm&ei=UfgAS7fHIIOi4Qah8oT7Cw&sa=X&oi=spellmeleon_result&resnum=1&ct=result&ved=0CAgQhgIwAA&usg=AFQjCNE6xnLenB4vRalVzqOPxhikz8Ut0g].The BBC had seemingly discovered evidence that the British military have, in thepast, used brainwashing techniques. The programme concerned a lecture given byMajor Alexander Kennedy on 26 February 1960, titled The scientific lessons ofinterrogation. This lecture was given at the Royal Institute in London. “Brainwashing techniques were used by some British interrogators during WorldWar II, according to evidence unearthed by the BBC. Their methods included theuse of drugs, hypnosis and sensory deprivation to extract confessions fromsuspected spies. It was not until 1960, well after end of the war, that thefirst allegations of brainwashing were made. These followed a lecture given in London by Alexander Kennedy, ahighly-respected professor of Psychological Medicine at the University ofEdinburgh. His speech was aimed at applying the lessons of wartime interrogation techniquesto the peacetime treatment of psychiatric illness. In it he referred to theeffects of a string of brainwashing techniques. Outrage followed. The press of the day concluded that his knowledge of such methods must have comefrom work developed in Britain. This is a charge strongly denied by ProfKennedy, who had served with British intelligence during the war. But his denial failed to calm the growing storm and ministers faced searchingquestions in the House of Commons. Finally, the then prime minister, Harold Macmillan, tried to put an end to thebrainwashing scandal during prime minister's questions. He said: \"The techniques to which these questions refer have never been used byany organisation responsible to Her Majesty's government.\" Those firm words, and Prof Kennedy's death just three months after making hisspeech, seemed to put an end to the controversy. However, the archives reveal that three years later, MP Francis Noel-Baker, wholike Prof Kennedy had served with military intelligence, wrote the followingletter to Mr Macmillan: \"It is within my own personal knowledge, and that of people with whom I servedduring the war, that a technique of brainwashing certainly was used by MajorKennedy, as he then was, and other interrogators at the Combined ServicesDetailed Interrogation Centre (CSDIC), outside Cairo, during the last war.\" It is not known how, if at all, the prime minister replied to this letter, butit certainly contradicts his denial that such methods were never used by Britishinterrogators.So, too, does another document, held in the National Archives. It is a reportwritten by Dick White, a man who was later to become head of M16. It focuses on interrogation methods that he witnessed being used by Britishofficers in Cairo during the war. Prof Kennedy, then Major Kennedy, was apsychological advisor guiding some of these interrogations. One was with an Egyptian man called Ellie Haggar, who was suspected of being aGerman spy. Mr White was to write: \"Among other methods employed by Kennedy, certain drugs were used to induceHaggar to confess. As might have been expected, the only result was that Haggarbecome mulish and indifferent to his fate and contracted pneumonia. \"The extraction of a confession took a fortnight and was, even then, not fullysatisfactorily achieved. With this example before me I suggested to all theofficers concerned that this was not the way to interrogate a spy.\" It could always be argued that Macmillan might have been unaware of Mr White'sreport when he made his emphatic denial in the Commons. But a former senior British intelligence officer, Col John Hughes-Wilson,believes that is unlikely. He said: \"I would be very surprised if a minister of any stamp were to stand upand talk on intelligence matters without whistling for the head of that serviceand saying, 'what is going on, draft me an answer'.\"I think if one wants to be brutally honest, Macmillan was seeking to deceive.In fact, to use un-Parliamentary language, he was telling lies.\" [67][part0000_split_023.html#_edn67] Speaking on the radio, broadcast author Dominic Streatfield described thetranscripts of the interrogation process; “He talks about hypnosis, sensory deprivation, interfering with people’s dreams,dosing them with drugs, putting people under intolerable stress over longperiods of time to induce psychotic states… They would use blindfolds, earmuffsand gloves so you couldn’t feel anything- you would be put in a black room andwhite noise would be played. No light and no indication of where they are andthey become extremely confused extremely quickly, they start hallucinating, theystart seeing things and hearing things.” Streatfield also points out that the techniques used involved drugs laterfavoured by the CIA, possibly alluding to a collusion of government experiments; “Amphetamines and Thorazine are mentioned in the lecture. At this time there wasno indication that these drugs were being used. Not until 1977 did knowledge ofthe CIA’s use of these drugs come about- so how did Kennedy know?” The lecture contained these telling snippets: “Essentials of the method. One, disorientation by the use of conditions ofpartial sensory deprivation…hypnotism can produce a temporary loss of function.Small amounts of drugs will produce hallucinatory experiences especially if usedwith sounds and unstructured visual stimuli…this accelerates the process of thedestruction of personal identity.” Phillip Baker, the son of MP Francis Noel Baker who raised the question of theuse of brainwashing in parliament, discovered his father’s memoirs after hisdeath. In these records, Major Kennedy is described as an advisor on psychiatryto intelligence services in the Middle East. He was also described in thediaries as an “expert on interrogation techniques for captured spies”. Baker andKennedy were great friends for many years. MI5 Officer Dick White was also quoted on the programme. He mentioned Kennedy asa psychological advisor for the security and intelligence agencies in the MiddleEast as early as 1943. White also told of a captured German soldier who wasinterrogated personally by Kennedy. “Certain drugs were used” White explained. It is clear then that LSD and other powerful drugs were used secretly onunsuspecting human subjects in order to test their efficiency. Thisexperimentation was conducted with little regard for the test subjects and wassanctioned by both the American and British governments."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE: CONTROL BY HYPNOSIS Testing and experimentation on members of the public was not exclusivelypractised by the CIA; the skills and facilities of highly respected andrecognized psychologists and psychiatrists were also utilised. “The participation of psychiatrists and medical schools in mind control researchwas not a matter of a few scattered doctors pursuing questionable lines ofinvestigation. Rather, the mind control experimentation was systematic,organized, and involved many leading psychiatrists and medical schools. The mindcontrol experiments were interwoven with radiation experiments, and research onchemical and biological weapons. They were funded by the CIA, Army, Navy, AirForce, and by other agencies including the Public Health Service and theScottish Rite Foundation. The psychiatrists, psychologists, neurosurgeons, andother contractors conducting the work were imbedded in a broad network ofdoctors. Much of the research was published in medical journals. The climate waspermissive, supportive, and approving of mind control experimentation.” [68][part0000_split_023.html#_edn68] George Estabrooks, 1885 -1973, Harvard graduate (1926) and Rhodes Scholar, was arevered hypnotist famous for his authoritarian direct induction screeds. He wasinvolved with the science of hypno-programming soldiers during World War Two.This process involved allowing soldiers to hypnotically take on board largeamounts of information into their subconscious, with conscious recall only atthe command of the programming hypnotist. The subject would be unaware of theinformation they had stored and were passing on and even unaware that they hadbeen hypnotised. Estabrooks later became chairman of the Department ofPsychology at Colgate University[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colgate_University], a private liberal artscollege[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_colleges_in_the_United_States] inHamilton, New York [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(village),_New_York].Evidence suggests Estabrooks was also involved in the search for the fabledhypno-programmed assassin; he was candid about the results of hisexperimentation. \"Is hypnosis dangerous? It can be. Under certain circumstances, it is dangerousin the extreme. It has even been known to lead to murder. Given the rightcombination of hypnotist and subject, hypnosis can be a lethal weapon.\"[69][part0000_split_023.html#_edn69] Estabrooks made a written proposal to the CIA on 22 June 1954, in which he mademany bold claims, stating, “In deep hypnosis the subject, military or civilian, can be given a message tobe delivered to say Colonel X in Berlin. The message will be perfectly safebecause the subject will have no memory in the waking state as to the message.It can be arranged that the subject will have no knowledge of ever having beenhypnotized. It can be arranged that no one beside Colonel X in Berlin canhypnotize the subject and recover the message….I will take a number of men andwill establish in them through the use of hypnotism the condition of splitpersonality. Consciously they will be ardent Communists, fanatical adherents tothe party line. Unconsciously they will be loyal Americans determined to thwartthe Communists at every turn. These men will have no knowledge of ever havingbeen hypnotized, and can only be hypnotized by such persons as the originaloperator may choose. Consciously they will associate with the Communists andlearn all their plans. Once every month they, as loyal Americans, will tell whatthey know. This sounds unbelievable, but I assure you, it will work.” In a 1971 article in Science Digest, Dr. Estabrooks claimed to have createdhypnotic couriers and counter-intelligence agents for operational use:“The ‘hypnotic courier’ provides a unique solution. I was involved in preparingarmy subjects during World War II. One successful case involved an Army Captain.He was an excellent subject but did not realize it. I put him under deep hypnosis, and gave him -- orally -- a vital message to bedelivered directly on his arrival in Japan to a certain colonel -- let's say hisname was Brown -- of military intelligence. Outside of myself, Colonel Brown wasthe only person who could hypnotize Captain Smith. This is \"locking.\" Iperformed it by saying to the hypnotized Captain: \"Until further orders from me,only Colonel Brown and I can hypnotize you. We will use a signal phrase 'themoon is clear.' Whenever you hear this phrase from Brown or myself you will passinstantly into deep hypnosis.” When Captain Smith re-awakened, he had no conscious memory of what happened intrance. All that he was aware of was that he must head for Tokyo to pick up adivision report. The system is virtually fool proof. As exemplified by thiscase, the information was \"locked\" in Smith's unconscious for retrieval by theonly two people who knew the combination. The subject had no conscious memory ofwhat happened, so could not spill the beans. No one else could hypnotize himeven if they might know the signal phrase” [70] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn70] George Estabrooks is one of the only mind control doctors who have publiclyacknowledged the building of ‘Manchurian Candidates’. In his book Spiritism,published in 1947, Estabrooks describes experimentation in which militarypsychiatrist Dr. P.L. Harriman endeavoured to create multiple personality. Inhis book Hypnotism, published in 1957, Estabrooks stated that the creation ofexperimental multiple personality for operational use in military subjects, whomhe referred to as ‘super spies’, is not only possible but also ethical due tothe extraordinary demands of war. Estabrooks frankly acknowledged that his “main interest has always been themilitary application of hypnosis”. He noted in Hypnotism that the “intelligentreader ... will sense that much more is withheld than has been told”. He commented in a chapter entitled Hypnotism in Warfare that:“The hand of the military must not be tied by any silly prejudices in the mindsof the general public. War is the end of all law. In the last analysis anydevice is justifiable which enables us to protect ourselves from defeat.”[71][part0000_split_023.html#_edn71] In the article Hypnosis Comes of Age, excerpted from Science Digest, April 1971,Estabrooks stated: “Not all applications of hypnotism to military intelligence are as tidy as that.Perhaps you have read The Three Faces of Eve. The book was based on a casereported in 1905 by Dr. Morton Prince of Massachusetts General Hospital andHarvard. He startled everyone in the field by announcing that he had cured awoman named Beauchamp of a split personality problem. Using post-hypnoticsuggestion to submerge an incompatible, childlike facet of the patient, he'dbeen able to make two other sides of Mrs. Beauchamp compatible, and lump themtogether in a single cohesive personality.” “The potential for military intelligence has been nightmarish. During World WarII, I worked this technique with a vulnerable Marine lieutenant I'll call Jones.Under the watchful eye of Marine Intelligence I spilt his personality into JonesA and Jones B. Jones A, once a \"normal\" working Marine, became entirelydifferent. He talked communist doctrine and meant it. He was welcomedenthusiastically by communist cells, was deliberately given a dishonourabledischarge by the Corps (which was in on the plot) and became a card-carryingparty member.The joker was Jones B, the second personality, formerly apparent in theconscious Marine. Under hypnosis, this Jones had been carefully coached bysuggestion. Jones B was the deeper personality, knew all the thoughts of JonesA, was a loyal American, and was \"imprinted\" to say nothing during consciousphases. All I had to do was hypnotize the whole man, get in touch with Jones B, theloyal American, and I had a pipeline straight into the Communist camp. It workedbeautifully for months with this subject, but the technique backfired. Whilethere was no way for an enemy to expose Jones' dual personality, they suspectedit and played the same trick on us later.” “Among the most complicated ploys used was the practice of sending a perfectlynormal, wide awake agent into enemy camp, after he'd been carefully coached inwaking hypnosis to 'act' the part of a potential hypnotism subject. Trained inauto-suggestion, or self-hypnosis, such a subject can pass every test used tospot a hypnotized person. Using it, he can control the rate of his heartbeat;anesthetize himself to a degree against pain of electric shock or torture. In the case of an officer we'll call Cox; this carefully prepared counterspy wasgiven a title to indicate he had access to top priority information. He wasplanted in an international cafe in a border country where it was certain therewould be enemy agents. He talked too much, drank a lot, made friends with localgirls, and pretended a childish interest in hypnotism. The hope was that hewould blunder into a situation where enemy agents would kidnap him and try tohypnotize him, in order to extract information from him. Cox worked so well that they fell for the trick. He never allowed himself to behypnotized during séances. While pretending to be a hypnotized subject of thefoe, he was gathering and feeding back information.”[72][part0000_split_023.html#_edn72] He later joined the ranks of other MK ULTRA doctors and boasted “I can hypnotiseany man without his knowledge or consent into committing treason”. Estabrooksearly insight was that if hypnosis could cure patients of multiple personality,it could surely induce them by the reversal of the same process. Estabrookswrote, “I believe the hypnotists power to be unlimited- or rather limited onlyby his intelligence and his scruples”. The CIA’s interest in the applications of hypnosis is shown in a declassifiedARTICHOKE document which states; “Suggestibility is a characteristic of the normal mind and it seems possible,even likely, that all normal persons could be hypnotized if we possessedadequate techniques.” A further confidential report compiled in 1966, titled: Hypnosis in Intelligence- Technical Report (Confidential – CIA), October 1966, stated that the agencyhad discovered “a posthypnotic suggestion is believed to remain effective forseveral months, and for years if periodically reinforced”. Although this technique may seem reasonably harmless (if you ignore the coercionagainst ones will), the spectre of trauma lingers in Estabrooks work. “Estabrooks only alludes to the severe abuse that is required to create a truemultiple, often referring to the trauma euphemistically as “a form ofhypnotism.” At one point, for instance, he notes that “[multiple personalities]are caused by a form of hypnotism in the first place! We will see that emotionalshock produces exactly the same results as hypnotism.” Later, he comes closer tothe grim reality when he states: “multiple personality could be both caused andcured by hypnotism. Remember that war is a grim business. Suppose wedeliberately set up that condition of multiple personality to further the endsof military intelligence.” Elsewhere, Estabrooks acknowledged that he himself had previously revealed that: “Everyone could be thrown into the deepest state of hypnotism by the use of what[I] termed the Russian method -- no holds barred, deliberate disintegration ofthe personality by psychic torture ... The subject might easily be left a mentalwreck but war is a grim business.” [73] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn73] The CIA were keen to employ these techniques in test scenarios and were notconservative in their choice of test subject. A declassified CIA document dated07 Jan 1953 describes the creation of multiple personality in 19 year old girls; “These subjects have clearly demonstrated that they can pass from a fully awakestate to a deep H [hypnotic] controlled state ... by telephone, by receivingwritten matter, or by the use of code, signal, or words and that control ofthose hypnotized can be passed from one individual to another without greatdifficulty. It has also been shown by experimentation with these girls that theycan act as unwilling couriers for information purposes, and that they can beconditioned to a point where they believe a change in identity on their parteven on the polygraph.” [74] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn74] Army psychologist J.G. Watkins hypnotised soldiers and programmed them tobelieve officers were enemy agents and for them to attack on sight. This wasincredibly successful. In one instance an officer was attacked with a knife thatthe soldier had hidden on his person and in another, he induced a soldier tofall into a trance using a yellow pencil to act as a trigger mechanism.Instructed not to reveal a certain phrase, the soldier steadfastly refused totalk until the pencil was placed in his hand and he then immediately fell into adeep trance. When in trance, as questioning continued, he revealed the testphrase to Watkins with absolutely no hesitation. When awoken he expressed denialat having done this. He repeated the experiment with the added incentive of $10reward for not divulging a new secret. The experiment produced similar results,the secret being exposed by the hypnotised subject immediately. Despite this thesoldier awoke smiling, sure that he had just won the bet. A further experiment was held in an army theatre in front of an audience ofaround two hundred military officials. A female recruit was instructed to revealonly her name rank and serial number. When in trance, Watkins elicited theinformation that her department was developing a new secret type of rocketpropellant fuel. The test was quickly drawn to a close by a senior officer whodashed to the stage to put a halt to proceedings, terrified that more sensitivefacts may be revealed. In other experiments using hypnosis, subjects were induced to put their handsinto beakers of acid or to pick up poisonous snakes, all at the behest of thehypnotist in control. “Two subjects who were told to throw sulphuric acid at a laboratory assistant(protected by glass) complied with the hypnotist’s commands.”[75][part0000_split_023.html#_edn75] Another account in the book Psychological Healing; A Historical and ClinicalStudy described, “Janet asked a deeply hypnotized female to commit several murders before adistinguished group of judges, stabbing some victims with rubber daggers andpoisoning others with sugar tablets. The hypnotized subject did all thesewithout hesitation.”[76] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn76] Another ARTICHOKE document revealed the results of Analogous Case #3. “A CIA Security Office employee was hypnotized and given a false identity. Shedefended it hotly, denying her true name and rationalizing with conviction thepossession of identity cards made out to her real self. Later, having had thefalse identity erased by suggestion, she was asked if she had ever heard of thename she had been defending as her own five minutes before. She thought, shookher head, and said, ‘That’s a pseudo if I ever heard one.’ Apparently she hadtrue amnesia for the entire episode.” In an experiment described in a document entitled SI and H experimentation (25September 1951), two female subjects took part in an exercise involving thesimulated planting of a bomb. Both subjects performed perfectly and were fullyamnesic for the entirety of the exercise. This was shown in document CIA MORI ID190527; “[Deleted] was instructed that upon awakening, she would proceed to [deleted]room where she would wait at the desk for a telephone call. Upon receiving thecall, a person known as “Jim” would engage her in normal conversation. Duringthe course of the conversation, this individual would mention a code word. Whenshe heard this code word, she would pass into a SI trance state, but would notclose her eyes and remain perfectly normal and continue the telephoneconversation. She was told that upon conclusion of the telephone conversation, she would thencarry out instructions: [Deleted] was shown an electric timing device. She wasinformed that this device was a bomb, and then instructed how to set the device.After [deleted] learned how to set and attach the device, she was told to takethe timing device which was in a briefcase, and proceed to the ladies room[where] she would be met by a girl whom she had never seen who would identifyherself by the code word “New York.” [Deleted] was then to show this individualhow to attach and set the timing device and further instructions would be giventhat the timing device was to be carried in the briefcase to [deleted] room,placed in the nearest empty electric-light plug and concealed in the bottom,left-hand drawer of [a] desk, with the device set for 82 seconds and turned on.” Estabrooks confidently explained the particulars of applying this techniqueeffectively, “The key to creating an effective spy or assassin rests in splitting a man’spersonality or creating multipersonality, with hypnotism. This is not sciencefiction…I have done it.” He also stated that he was definitely not unique in the studying of thisparticular field; “Clinical hypnotists throughout the world jumped on the multiple personalitybandwagon as a fascinating frontier. By the 1920's, not only had they learned toapply post-hypnotic suggestion to deal with this weird problem, but also hadlearned how to split certain complex individuals into multiple personalitieslike Jekyll-Hyde’s’.”[77] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn77] CIA doctor Morse Allen also spoke of such experimentation: “Take an existing egostate- such as an imaginary childhood playmate- and build it into a separatepersonality, unknown to the first”. The doctor could then work with the newpersonality and manipulate it to follow his commands. In September 1951 Morse Allen hypnotised two female CIA staff members andinduced them to fall into a trance after a code word was spoken to them over thetelephone. “Subject was told that she would go to a small room containing (deleted)’s safeand seat herself at (deleted)’s desk. She was given the combination of the safe.She was told that she would receive a telephone call from an individual…whowould, during the conversation, mention a code word to her and she wasinstructed that upon hearing the code word …she should proceed to the safe, openit, search the safe, and find a given Top Secret document…conceal it on herselfand proceed to the ladies’ room, where she would wait for another girl toapproach her.”[78] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn78] When the second lady received the file, they both returned to their respectiveoffices and fell into a deep trance. Neither of the women had any recollectionof any of the events taking place. Allen produced a film called The Black Art tobe shown to sceptics within the agency. The film depicted an Oriental diplomat,having been hypnotised by a CIA agent, stealing documents from a locked safefrom his own embassy. This was to show the possible and achievable applicationsof such techniques in real world scenarios. Estabrooks also claimed that, “Individuals could be taught to do anything including murder, suicide, etc. I dobelieve that you could carry out acts that would be against an individual'smoral feelings if they were rightly, psychologically conditioned”. He later stated; “All right you say. This sounds beautiful on paper. But what about thewell-known psychological principle that no one will do anything under hypnosisthat he wouldn’t do when he’s awake? My experiments have shown this assumptionis poppycock. It depends not so much on the attitude of the subject as on thatof the operator himself …In wartime, the motivation for murder under hypnosisdoesn’t have to be very strong.”[79] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn79] The general consensus in the world of hypnosis is that a practitioner can in noway cause a subject to perform an action that they would not normally oralternatively, make the subject transgress their previously-held moralboundaries. This is true in the majority of cases, particularly inhypnotherapy, which is a wonderful healing tool. In order to manipulate asubject, the hypnotist would have to abandon all morals and be prepared todisregard any and all therapeutic avenues. Although not easy, it is far fromimpossible to make a subject do your bidding against their better judgement. This could be achieved in a number of ways: firstly, the therapist could framean immoral act in a moral way. For example, a subject who would normally neverkill another could be manipulated into doing so if they felt the person was adanger to the subject’s family or was framed as being particularly despicable.The hypnotist could perhaps suggest that killing the person would be the onlyway to save the subject’s family or even the world. Immoral acts can bejustified in a societal sense by extraordinary circumstances (such as war) andthe hypnotist could make the subject believe that this is one of thoseoccasions. Secondly, the hypnotist could instil a total level of trust in the subject,convincing them to follow their orders without question. This works because thesubject subconsciously ‘knows’ that the hypnotist has their best interests atheart and would in no way allow any harm to come to them. It may seem like theyare throwing acid at a passer-by, but as they trust the hypnotist, they are surehe would never really allow them to do something so dreadful. In this waysubjects can be convinced to partake in actions that may cause themselvesphysical harm, safe in the knowledge that the hypnotist would never allowanything bad to happen to them. Finally, a complete takeover can be produced through deep hypnosis and framingof actions as mundane. For example, you could convince a subject, upon hearing atrigger phrase, to stand up and begin shooting as if they were at a rifle range.Regardless of where the subject is, they will act as if they are at thepre-designated place and act accordingly, firing shots in the belief that theyare acting appropriately. I would stress that this is not easy and requires a hugely immoral practitionerand many hours of manipulation to be effective.Seemingly the age of the subject held no cause to resist experimentation forEstabrooks; “Dr. Estabrooks did experiments on children. He corresponded with FBI DirectorJ. Edgar Hoover about using hypnosis to interrogate juvenile delinquents. Hisexperimentation on children raises the possibility that investigators haveattempted to create Manchurian Candidates in children.” [80][part0000_split_023.html#_edn80] “Estabrooks also notes that children make especially good subjects, given thatthey “are notoriously easy to hypnotize.” This is a nice way of saying thatchildren are particularly vulnerable to abuse and have more of a tendency todissociate traumatic experiences, thereby creating alter identities that canthen be exploited and controlled.”[81] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn81] A CIA document, dated 10 Feb 1954, described an experiment in which unsuspectingassassins were created through hypnotism; “Miss [deleted] was then instructed (having expressed a fear of firearms) thatshe would use every method at her disposal to awaken Miss [deleted] (now in adeep hypnotic sleep) and failing this, she would pick up a pistol and fire it atMiss [deleted]. She was instructed that she would not hesitate to “kill.” Miss[deleted] carried out these suggestions including firing the (unloaded) gun at[deleted]. After proper suggestions were made, both were awakened. Miss[deleted] expressed absolute denial that the foregoing sequence had happened.” This experiment was performed and recorded by Morse Allen. CIA agent William Buckley also utilised the power of hypnotism for his ownnefarious gains; in controlled experiments he was able to make female volunteersundress in front of him and induce these same subjects to enthusiastically andwillingly offer themselves up for sex. A 1951 declassified document entitled CIA MORI ID 140393, dated 09 July 1951,clarified the kind of people that were employed by the CIA to teach hypnotism: “On 2 July 1951 approximately 1:00 p.m. the instruction began with [deleted]relating to the student some of his sexual experiences. [Deleted] stated that hehad constantly used hypnotism as a means of inducing young girls to engage insexual intercourse with him. [Deleted], a performer in [deleted] orchestra wasforced to engage in sexual intercourse with [deleted] while under the influenceof hypnotism. [Deleted] stated that he first put her into a hypnotic trance and then suggestedto her that he was her husband and that she desired sexual intercourse with him.[Deleted] further stated that many times going home on [deleted] he would usehypnotic suggestion to have a girl turn around and talk to him and suggestsexual intercourse to him and that as a result of these suggestions induced byhim he spent approximately five nights a week away from home engaging in sexualintercourse.” The following interview was taken in 1952 and despite not being stated, thedoctor being interviewed was George Estabrooks. “CIA document and page number: 140394, pp. 2, 3. Title: Interview with[Deleted]. Date: 25 February 1952. Q: What are your experiences in general with hypnotism? A: I have been a professional hypnotist for at least 15 years. At present, I amemployed on a very confidential basis two days a week. Q: Can you obtain information from an individual, willing or unwilling, byhypnotism? A: Definitely, yes. Many of the medical cases I work on are involved inobtaining personal, intimate information, and through hypnotism, I have beenquite successful in obtaining this. If an individual refuses to co-operate withhypnosis, the doctors with whom I work use drugs, always sodium amytal.Q: How far do you think individuals could be controlled by hypnosis?A: This is a very difficult subject. Post-hypnotics will last twenty years andwill be very strong if re-enforced from time to time.Q: Have you ever had any experience with drugs?A: Yes, many times. I have worked with doctors using sodium amytal and Pentothaland have obtained hypnotic control after the drugs were used. In fact, manytimes drugs were used for the purpose of obtaining hypnotic control.Q: Do you have any ideas that hypnotism could be used as a weapon?A: Yes, I have thought about this often. It could certainly be used in obtaininginformation from recalcitrant people particularly with drugs. It could be usedas a recruiting source for special types of work. A good hypnotist runninghypnotic shows for entertainment would pick up a great many subjects, some ofwhom might be exceptionally good subjects for us. These subjects could easily betabbed and put to use.Q: Have you ever been able to produce hypnosis without an individual'sknowledge?A: Yes, through the relaxing technique and on rare occasions [I've] been able toproduce hypnotism against a person's will. However, you cannot count on this andto attempt to attach an individual who did not want to be hypnotized alone wouldbe almost an impossible task. In that type of case, I would use sodium amytaland/or sodium pentothal.Q: How effective are post-hypnotics; over what distances and time can they beeffective?A: Properly used post-hypnotics will last twenty years. They can be made moreeffective by re-enforcement from time to time. Post-hypnotics are not affectedat all by time or travel or distance away from the person who placed thepost-hypnotic. As a rule, post-hypnotics should be 100% effective in goodsubjects.Q: Can individuals be made to do things under hypnosis that they would nototherwise?A: Individuals could be taught to do anything including murder, suicide, etc. Ido believe that you could carry out acts that would be against an individual'smoral feelings if they were rightly, psychologically conditioned.” Researcher Dave McGowan elaborated on the violence used within CIA-sponsored,hypnotic mind control; “Years later, another CIA-connected psychiatrist/hypnotist named Paul Verdierwrote an obscure little book, entitled Brainwashing and the Cults: An Expose onCapturing the Human Mind that echoed much of what Estabrooks had written.Verdier begins by acknowledging that: “It must be accepted that brainwashing …is now being used here by devious persons with personal gain in mind,” though hemisrepresents who those “devious persons” are. He then explains that the goal of mind control is to access those areas of thebrain that are outside of the conscious control of the individual bycircumventing the normal inhibiting response of the cerebral cortex: “anindividual’s voluntary conscious self-control must be bypassed orshort-circuited.” In order to disable the brain’s \"cortical block,\" Verdier recommends alcohol,euphoric drugs, isolation, solitary confinement, and - \"the most dramatic andunique item in the brainwashing arsenal\" - hypnosis. All of these are methodsthat have been extensively tested by the CIA under the rubric of the MK-ULTRAprogram. Verdier goes on to explain that to achieve truly lasting mind control requiresthe creation of “profound and deep emotional states.” Recommended are fear,shock and anxiety, which have “an intense disinhibitive effect on the humanbrain.” What this means, in essence, is that emotional trauma facilitates theaccessing of dissociative states. The most effective of the “profound and deep emotional states,” according toVerdier, is pain. The doctor explains that this is because, “according to theeminent neurologist, Dr. Wilder Penfield, sensations of pain from the muscularsensory system enter the sub-cortical brain regions directly.” Penfield was, itshould be noted, an associate of medical torture expert and MK-ULTRA operativeDr. David Ewen Cameron. Verdier makes clear that pain and fear are among the most effective tools in theMK-ULTRA toolbox when he steals a page from Estabrooks’ book: “Russian politicalscientists do support the belief that given enough punishment, all the people inany time or place are susceptible to hypnotic control” (this is, by the way, avery common form of agency disinformation – acknowledge the existence of mindcontrol, but blame it all on those damn ‘communists’). He also echoes Estabrooks’ belief that children are ideal candidates for mindcontrol operations, stating - with apparent approval - that: “Brainwashing canbe slow, insidious and sure when applied to children early in life.” He furtheradds that: “It is likely that there is a short period of time following corporalpunishment when the child is in a state of decortication - hypnosis, so tospeak. This is the ideal time to plant the positive instructions for betterbehaviour in the future.” What the good doctor considers “corporal punishment”and “positive instructions” is left to the reader’s imagination. Interestingly, Verdier notes that: “One of the most pronounced emotionalexperiences that a human being can undergo is having his or her life threatened.Threats of death are used as a basic tool by brainwashing Communists. Even amongthem, however, this threat is used sparingly, for they know that humans quicklyadapt to this type of threat, especially if it is repeatedly given but nevercarried out. In order to avoid this routinization of stressful emotionalsituations, they have been known to casually execute prisoners for the apparenteffect it has on others.” [82] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn82] Dr. Martin Orne was one of the leading experts on hypnosis of the 20th century.For about 30 years he was the editor of The International Journal of Clinicaland Experimental Hypnosis. He and Dr. Louis Jolyon West were the only twodocumented MK ULTRA psychiatrists professionally active into the late 1990’s.Orne wrote The potential uses of hypnosis in interrogation, which was presentedin The Manipulation of Human Behavior and published in 1961. When Martin Orne died in the year 2000, he held the prestigious position ofEmeritus Professor of Psychiatry and Psychology at the University ofPennsylvania [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania]. He was aprofessor in the University’s School of Medicine for 32 years before beingawarded the post of Emeritus Professor in 1996. Dr. Orne was born in Vienna [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna] in 1927; heimmigrated to the United States and received his Medical Degree from TuftsUniversity [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tufts_University] Medical School in1955. Orne went on to hold a residency in Psychiatry at Massachusetts MentalHealth Centre [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Mental_Health_Center]and gained his Ph.D in Psychology from Harvard University[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University] in 1958. Dr. Orne establishedand directed the Unit for Experimental Psychiatry at Penn State University in1964. This is a research laboratory, located in the School of Medicine of theUniversity, which has conducted uninterrupted scientific research since itsestablishment. Martin Orne's experimentation in the realm of hypno-programming was reportedlyfinanced by the Human Ecology Fund, a CIA cover that processed its paper trailthrough Cornell University. John Marks, author of The Search for the ManchurianCandidate, managed to obtain one hundred and thirty nine whole boxes ofpreviously declassified CIA documents under a Freedom of Information Actrequest. These documents include an agency report detailing a $30,000 researchgrant being provided to Orne from the Human Ecology Fund. Also included in thesedocuments was a similar receipt detailing a payment of $30,000 from Boston'sScientific Engineering Institute (SEI); this too has been shown to be anotherfront organisation for channelling CIA research funding. Martin Orne stringently denied any connection to the CIA or mind controlprogrammes and disputed Estabrooks findings, publicly at least. Orne, along withJoly West, started the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, seen by many as the goto guys for the denial of satanic ritual abuse of children. In cases whereritual abuse or mind control style experimentation is discovered, the FMSF willsweep in and offer the explanation that the children involved are either simplylying or have had these false memories implanted by a malevolent therapist.Interestingly, they acknowledge and promote the existence of false memories butwill not entertain the concept that governments, infinitely better financed thanany therapist, may also employ this technique. Despite the public perception that hypnosis is at worst, a stage show and atbest, a method of therapy, it would appear that it is in fact a viable tool forthe control of the mind. Not only is this control complete, but itseffectiveness lies in the fact that it is virtually undetectable, even to thehapless subject."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX: ANNIHILATING THE MIND Ewen Cameron, of McGill University in Montreal, was based at the Allen MemorialInstitute and conducted hundreds of experiments on mental patients, usuallywithout their consent and often as the treatment for very mild psychologicalproblems such as depression. Cameron was funded by the CIA, the CanadianGovernment, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Gershickter Foundation. FormerPentagon advisor to the CIA, Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty, immortalised in theOliver Stone movie JFK with a portrayal by Donald Sutherland, spoke to authorDick Russell in 1992. He spoke about the Allen Memorial Institute and hinted atconnections to Operation Paperclip; “If you get a hold of a directory for the American Psychiatric Association inaround 1956 or 1957, you’ll be surprised to find that an enormous percentage ofthe individuals listed are foreign-born. Mostly they came out of Germany andEastern Europe in a big wave. They were all called “technical specialists”, butin reality they were psychiatrists. They went into jobs at universities mostly-but many were working on these “unconventional” mind control programs for USintelligence…These would go to people like Dr. Cameron in Canada.”[83][part0000_split_023.html#_edn83] Donald Ewen Cameron was born in Scotland[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Scotland.htm] in 1901. He graduated fromthe University of Glasgow [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Glasgow]in1924 and began his career as resident surgeon at Glasgow Infirmary. In 1929 hemoved to Canada in order to work in the Brandon Mental Hospital[http://members.tripod.com/hillmans2002/bmhctour.html]. In 1936 Cameron becameDirector of Research at Worcester State Hospital[http://www.opacity.us/site56_worcester_state_hospital.htm] in Massachusetts andin 1938 was appointed Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at Albany StateMedical School [http://www.albany.edu/]. It was at Albany that Cameron firstconducted research into sensory deprivation and its effects on the memory of thepatient. During the Second World War [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WW.htm],Cameron began working for the Office of Strategic Services[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWoss.htm] (OSS), the precursor to theCIA. In 1943 he was also able to travel to Canada and establish the psychiatrydepartment at Montreal's McGill University[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGill_University], becoming director of thenewly-created Allen Memorial Institute[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Memorial_Institute]. In November 1945 Cameron, who was still working for the OSS[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWoss.htm], was dispatched to Germany[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Germany.htm] by the future CIA directorAllen Dulles [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAdullesA.htm], in order toexamine Rudolf Hess [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERhess.htm] andassess his fitness to stand trial at Nuremberg[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWnuremberg.htm]. Hess had alreadycomplained of attempts of brainwashing by John Rawlings Rees, the director ofthe Tavistock Institute, which makes one wonder if Cameron had any ulteriormotives in his mission. During the course of his research, Cameron discovered that \"once a subjectentered an amnesiac, somnambulistic state, they would become hypersensitive tosuggestion\". In other words, once induced into the correct mental state, thesubject could be brainwashed. The CIA[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWcia.htm] became aware of Cameron'sresearch and, feeling it was of use, in 1957 recruited him to run experimentsspecifically for MK ULTRA [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKULTRA]. As it wastechnically illegal for the CIA to conduct operations inside America, Cameronwas obliged to carry out his experiments at the Allen Memorial Institute[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Memorial_Institute] in Canada. The CIAhelpfully arranged funding via Cornell University[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University] in New York. From January 1957 to September 1960, Dr. Cameron’s project received $64,242.44in CIA funds, as shown in CIA MORI ID 17468 (a declassified CIA document). When the CIA stopped funding him, Cameron received $57,750 from the Canadiangovernment to continue his research. Other mental health project grants awardedto Dr. Cameron by the Department of National Health and Welfare included: “Project #604-5-11, The Effect of Senescence on Resistance to Stress, $195,388,50-57, Project #604-5-13, Research Studies on EEG and Electrophysiology, $60,353,50-57, Project #604-5-14, Support for a Behavioural Laboratory, $17,875, 50-54, Project #604-5-76, Study of Effect of Nucleic Acid on Memory Impairment in theAged, $18,000, 59-63, Project #604-5-432, A Study of Factors Which Promote or Retard PersonalityChange in Individuals Exposed to Prolonged Repetition of Verbal Signals,$57,750, 61-64.” [84] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn84] The extent and desired outcomes of the experimentation were hidden from thepublics view; the techniques that made it into the public’s consciousness wereskilfully spun to appear as the most technologically advanced methods oftreatment available. What was definitely mired in deception was the funding ofthe experimentation and the number of institutions that had foreknowledge ofwhat was really transpiring. “In Canada, the issue took much longer to surface, becoming widely known in 1984on a CBC [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation] newsshow, The Fifth Estate [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_fifth_estate]. It waslearned that not only had the CIA funded Dr. Cameron[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Ewen_Cameron]'s efforts, but perhaps evenmore shockingly, the Canadian government was fully aware of this, and had laterprovided another $500,000 in funding to continue the experiments. Thisrevelation largely derailed efforts by the victims to sue the CIA as their U.S.counterparts had, and the Canadian government eventually settled out of courtfor $100,000 to each of the 127 victims. None of Dr. Cameron's personal recordsof his involvement with MKULTRA survive, since his family destroyed them afterhis death from a heart attack while mountain climbing in 1967.”[85][part0000_split_023.html#_edn85] Much of the CIAs involvement at the funding level was disguised behind otherseemingly innocuous organisations; “In 1955, the CIA set up a secret front organization, known as the Society forthe Investigation of Human Ecology (SIHE), to fund further studies. CIAemployee, Dr. John Gittinger and Dr. Wolff from Cornell, assisted in the programformation. Approximately a year later, Dr. Gittinger read an article, publishedin the American Journal of Psychiatry, written by Dr. Ewen Cameron from theAllen Memorial Institute of Psychiatry, and entitled Psychic Driving…The articleprompted him to invite Dr. Cameron to submit an application for SIHE researchfunds…On March 4, 1957, the CIA approved the Cameron grant as MKULTRA Subproject68 for the period of time from March 18, 1957 to June 30, 1960.” [86][part0000_split_023.html#_edn86] In Cameron, the CIA had found someone who was not afraid to push the ethicalboundaries in the pursuit of knowledge; “Cameron began conducting unethical and inhumane brainwashing experiments atBrandon Mental Hospital in the 1930’s. Schizophrenic patients were forced to lienaked in red light for eight hours a day for periods as long as eight months.Another experiment involved overheating patients in an electric cage until theirbody temperatures reached 102 degrees.”[87] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn87] Cameron used electroshock, sensory deprivation, isolation andbarbiturate-induced comas for sometimes weeks at a time, in order to‘de-pattern’ clients. This is essentially to wipe the memory and personality ofthe patient in order to reprogram “desired personality traits”. This was sold asa therapeutic technique to remove harmful negative patterns like depression,blanking the mind to introduce new patterns. The use of electroshock therapy towipe previously held patterns of behaviour was termed “annihilation” by Cameron.He believed that the most effective treatment was to “destroy pathologicalbehaviour patterns held in the memory storage systems”. Cameron felt that byerasing behaviour patterns through physiological means, new patterns could beimplanted in their place. This was based on Cameron’s postulation; “Whether the behaviour patterns of adults could be erased by a physiologicalprocess that attacked neural patterns. Could adults be made theoreticallypatternless? Could they be returned to a state of neurological and psychologicalinfancy for a short period, and then could new patterns of behaviour beintroduced?”[88] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn88] In 1960 an article was published in the Comprehensive Psychiatry journal inwhich Cameron explained the effects of depatterning on a subject; “The patient loses all recollection of the fact that he formally possessed aspace time image which served to explain the events of the day to him. With thisloss, all anxiety also disappears. In the third stage, his conceptual span islimited to a few minutes and to entirely concrete events. He volunteers a fewstatements on questioning: He says he is sleepy or that he feels fine. He cannotconceptualise where he is, nor does he recognise those who treat him…What the patient talks about are only his sensations of the moment, and he talks aboutthem almost exclusively in highly concrete terms. His remarks are entirelyuninfluenced by previous recollections, nor are they governed in any way by hisforward anticipations. He lives in the immediate present. All schizophrenicsymptoms have disappeared. There is complete amnesia for all events in hislife.” In order to achieve this, he would put patients with mild depression in sensorydeprivation for up to sixty five days at a time, followed by a similar number ofdays on LSD until the mind was completely destroyed. Following this, loopedtapes of instructive voices were played continuously, directly into the head ofthe patient with irremovable headphones. Messages were repeated to the patientfor weeks at a time. This technique was called ‘psychic driving’. “Cameron’s experiments funded under MKULTRA Subproject 68 were calleddepatterning or “psychic driving.” He combined electro convulsive therapy [ECT]with chemically induced sleep therapy. The intensive electroshocks used in theseexperiments were not the same form of ECT used routinely in the treatment ofdepression. Both the voltage and the number of shocks administered were greatlyincreased. Instead of stopping after the procedure had induced one grand malseizure, the subjects were shocked again and again until no further seizurescould be elicited. There was no question that this was a profoundly intrusiveand destructive form of electroshock, which was far different from that whichwas conventionally used for therapeutic purposes.” [89][part0000_split_023.html#_edn89] Cameron, with the aid of the CIA, was able to customize the Allen Memorialbuilding to perfectly fit his specific needs; “Using CIA funding, Cameron converted the horse stables[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stables] behind Allen Memorial into an elaborateisolation and sensory deprivation chamber which he kept patients locked in forweeks at a time.” [90] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn90] While sleeping, patients would be forced to listen to messages designed toreprogram their behaviour. In a paper published in the American Journal ofPsychiatry, entitled Psychic Driving, Dr. Cameron described his brainwashingtechniques. Cameron noted that psychic driving provided a way to make “direct,controlled changes in personality.”[91] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn91] Working with his assistant Leonard Rubenstein, Cameron experimented with sensorydeprivation combined with drugs to break down the subject’s will and leave themopen to the taped messages. In a 02 August 1977 New York Times interview,Rubenstein admitted that their work was directly related to brainwashing. The combination of massive amounts of electro-convulsive shock, drug-inducedsleep and sensory isolation left the patients of Cameron in a vegetated state.When fully depatterned, patients were incontinent, unable to feed themselves andunable to state their name, location or the date. They were reduced to blankslates, husks of people prepared for Cameron to then apply his psychic drivingand rebuild their personality to his own desired specifications. “In the second stage, psychic driving was introduced. This consisted of hundredsof hours of tape loops being played to the patient through earphones, specialhelmets, or speakers in the sensory isolation room. Dr. Cameron received a grantfrom Canada’s Department of Health and Welfare for $57,750 for the years 1961 to1964 for “A Study of Factors Which Promote or Retard Personality Change inIndividuals Exposed to Prolonged Repetition of Verbal Signals.”[92][part0000_split_023.html#_edn92] The messages played were initially recordings of the patients own voices, whichis termed ‘autopsychic driving’. However, most people found this to bepsychologically unbearable and so staff at the McGill Institute recorded theirown voices for use on the patients. This technique was called “heteropsychicdriving” by Cameron. The messages were either in a negative vein such as,‘nobody likes you, there is something wrong with you’ or positive, ‘people likeyou, you are popular’. Often Cameron would play both, one after the other.Cameron felt that the longer these messages were played, the better, theresultant over stimulation leading, in his mind, to eventual catharsis by thepatient. Cameron wrote, “If the senses are continually overloaded theirbreakdown is to be expected. Analogous to this is the breakdown of theindividual under interrogation”. Patients who continually tried to remove the headphones to stop the never endingloops of voices were forcibly sedated with drugs. The chemically induced sleepnot only prevented the removal of headphones and the possible escape of theconfused patient, but also served to further bewilder and disorientate thepatient. Sleep treatment also seemed to enhance the “annihilating” effects ofthe electro-convulsive therapy. Negative messages could be played continuouslyfor up to sixty day’s straight or in some cases, even more. One patientreportedly received driving techniques for one hundred and one days with “nopositive results” being obtained from the sessions. Sensory deprivation was alsoused to strip away personality. Although Cameron was aware of the effects of theprocess and also aware that no one had endured more than one hundred and thirtynine hours in experiments conducted by the CIA, he happily left people inisolation for up to thirty five days. If patients resisted ‘treatment’ they wereincapacitated with curare, a poison that can give the prolonged feeling of dyingin the subject, as well as having incapacitating and anaesthetic qualities. \"Canadian researcher, Dr. Ewen Cameron, under long-term CIA contract, attemptedto depattern, and reprogram his psychiatric patients' personalities wholesale.He started with 15 to 65 days of 'sleep therapy,' during which a patient waskept under nearly 24 hours a day, through the administration of cocktails ofThorazine, Nembutal, Seconal, Veronal, and Phenergam. Throughout this sleepperiod, the patient would be awakened two or three times a day for electroshocktreatments, given at an intensity 20-40 times the 'normal' convulsion-producingstrength.”[93] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn93] Cameron and his staff were, seemingly, made of pretty stern stuff. Prior to theintroduction of forced druggings, the nurses often had to wrestle escapingpatients into submission before forcibly returning them to treatment. The loyalty of his staff was in no way rewarded with kindness by Cameron.Several members of his team fell under his diagnostic gaze, Cameron feeling thatcertain individuals displayed the telltale signs of a depressive personality.Several of his nurses and people close to him were dutifully depatterned. “The frequent screams of the patients that echoed through the hospital did notdeter Cameron or most of his associates in their attempts to depattern theirsubjects completely” [94] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn94] Sensory deprivation, as CIA research and other agency interrogation materialsdemonstrate, is a remarkably simple concept. Despite being known most commonlyas a new age, therapeutic relaxation technique, sensory deprivation is actuallya devastatingly effective method of torture. It can be inflicted by immobilizingindividuals in small, soundproof rooms and fitting them with blacked-out gogglesand earmuffs. The shattering effects of this simple procedure are described byAlfred McCoy of the University of Wisconsin-Madison; “The first thing that happens is extraordinary hallucinations akin to mescaline;I mean extreme hallucinations of sight and sound. It is followed, in some caseswithin just two days, by a breakdown akin to psychosis.” [95][part0000_split_023.html#_edn95] This would have been well known to Cameron as the effects had been previouslystudied at McGill University. In 1951 the CIA engaged McGill's director ofpsychology, Dr. Donald Hebb, and others to conduct sensory-deprivationexperiments on volunteer students. They showed intense isolation disrupts clearthinking enough to make subjects receptive to suggestion. They were alsoformidable interrogation techniques, amounting to torture when forciblyadministered. Linda MacDonald was one such victim of Dr. Ewen Cameron’s destructive mindcontrol experiments. In 1963 Dr. Cameron was president of the American and WorldPsychiatric Associations and at this time he treated Linda. He used a‘treatment’ which involved intensive application of drug disinhibition (allowingthe patient to feel the effects of large doses with no fear of overdose),prolonged sleep and drawn out psychological isolation. These were combined withelectro-convulsive therapy sessions. The amount of electricity introduced intoLinda’s brain was seventy six times the maximum recommended safe amount. Dr.Cameron’s treatment of Linda resulted in permanent and complete amnesia,reducing her to the level of a new born baby, unable to complete basic functionssuch as speaking or using the toilet unaided. To this day, Linda has no memoryof her life with her husband or children prior to treatment and whilst she nowrecognises who these people are, she is unable to rekindle any emotionalconnections. “Life changed for Linda when the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation program, TheFifth Estate, aired a segment on Dr. Cameron on January 17, 1984. A Vancouvernewspaper ran a full-page story on Robert Loggie, a Vancouver man who had beenexperimented on by Dr. Cameron. Loggie was a plaintiff in the class action suitagainst the CIA for Dr. Cameron’s MKULTRA experiments, which was settled out ofcourt for $750,000, divided among the eight plaintiffs. Linda’s mother phonedher about the program. Linda shook a lot in reaction to the news and didn’t knowwhat to do. Through a reporter she got in touch with a Washington lawyerrepresenting the eight Canadian plaintiffs. He advised Linda that she could notbe a party to the class action suit against the CIA because she was ‘treated’ byDr. Cameron after his CIA funding had stopped. The Canadian government hadpicked up the funding by 1963. Eventually she got $100,000 plus legal fees fromthe Canadian government.”[96] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn96] The use of electric shock to the brain for the creation of amnesia with hypnosiswas discussed by an ARTICHOKE document dated 03 December 1951: “[Deleted] is reported to be an authority on electric shock. He is apsychiatrist of considerable note. [Deleted] explained that electric shock mightbe of considerable interest to the ‘Artichoke’ type of work. He stated that thestandard electric-shock machine (Reiter) could be used. He stated that usingthis machine with convulsive treatment, he could guarantee amnesia for certainperiods of time, and particularly he could guarantee amnesia for any knowledgeof use of the convulsive shock. He stated that the lower setting of the machineproduced a different type of shock. When this lower current type of shock wasapplied without convulsion, it had the effect of making a man talk. He said thatthis type of shock produced in the individual excruciating pain. He stated thatthere would be no question that the individual would be quite willing to giveinformation if threatened with the use of this machine. It was [deleted]'sopinion that an individual could gradually be reduced through the use ofelectro-shock treatment to the vegetable level.” [97][part0000_split_023.html#_edn97] Previously Ewen Cameron had sat on the medical tribunal board for the Nuremburgtrials, prosecuting Nazi doctors for exactly the same thing he himself was latercarrying out, human experimentation. John Gittinger, CIA agent and psychologist, was Ewen Cameron’s project officer.In testimony before Congress on 03 August 1977, Gittinger responded to SenatorKennedy’s questions on his involvement;“The general idea ... is that brainwashing was largely a process of isolating ahuman being, keeping him out of contact, putting him out of control, putting himunder long stress in relationship to interviewing and interrogation, and thatthey could produce any change that way.” Linda MacDonald was not the only member of the public to sue the institute;“Montreal clinic experimented with electroshock by Jeff Heinrich “A woman hasbeen awarded $100,000 in compensation after receiving controversial electroshocktreatment in a Montreal psychiatric institute in 1953. “I’m stunned,” GailKastner, 70, said yesterday. After some reflection she added: “I’m pleased andI’m numb.” The shock treatment turned the then 19 year old honours student intoa woman who sucked her thumb, talked like a baby, demanded to be fed from abottle and urinated on the floor. She was ostracised by her affluent family andended up living in poverty. Ms. Kastner was left out of a 1994 federalcompensation package for other victims of brainwashing because she was deemed tohave undergone less intense treatment that had fewer long-term effects. Now, aFederal Court judge has reversed that decision and awarded her $100,000, thesame Ottawa granted a decade ago to 77 other victims of Dr. Ewen Cameron, thedirector of the Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal. In 2000, Ms. Kastner suedthe Allan Memorial for $4.2 million, but lost. She tried to appeal, but with nosuccess. The federal compensation doesn’t nearly equal what she could have won.“It begs the question: if I’m awarded now, why was I turned down in my lawsuit?”said Ms. Kastner, who lives alone on a guaranteed income supplement of $1000 amonth. 253 of Mr. Cameron’s other patients also had their claims rejected.Carried out from 1950 to 1965, Mr. Cameron’s now-discredited “de-patterning”program of massive electroshock therapy and drug-induced sleep was funded by theCIA and Canada’s Health Department….In 1953, Ms. Kastner was a 19 year oldhonours student from a wealthy Montreal family. Suffering from mild depressionand anxiety, she was admitted to the Allan Memorial twice for short stays andgiven electroshock treatments – 63 in all. She was also put into comas by beinginjected with insulin and given different drugs to induce sleep. The goal was to“de-pattern” her brain so she could recover and lead a normal life.”[98][part0000_split_023.html#_edn98] Cameron’s experimentation was not limited to patients at the Allen MemorialInstitute. He also looked further afield in order to find suitable subjects: “To Dr. Ewen Cameron, Canada’s prisons seemed like a logical place to conductexperiments on what strange new drugs could do to the human mind. In 1953, theMcGill University psychiatrist wrote to the second in command of Canada’s prisonservice to see if he had any insights into “the pharmacological, psychologicaland surgical suppression or obliteration of certain functions of behaviour as aresearch tool.” [99] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn99] In one such experiment, twenty three female inmates were administered LSD aspart of a 1961 study at the now defunct Federal Prison for Women in Kingston,Ontario. Inmate Dorothy Proctor, aged eighteen at the time and serving a threeyear sentence, received at least one dose of the powerful hallucinogen in a1.5-metre-by-2.5-metre windowless, underground segregation cell, lit by a singlebulb with only a mattress and a hole through which to pass bodily waste. In1998, Proctor sued the government and former Correctional Service of Canada(CSC) officials for giving her the drug, saying the experience had caused herbrain damage and terrifying hallucinations for the majority of her life. This was reported in at least one newspaper:“The federal government and a former prison psychologist have confessed tobattery and negligence for giving LSD to a teenaged inmate in the 1960s. Theadmission by the government and psychologist Mark Eveson in Ontario’s SuperiorCourt of Justice is a key victory for former prisoner Dorothy Proctor in herthree-year battle for compensation.”[100] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn100] These early experiments laid the foundation for the CIA's two-stage tortureprocess; sensory deprivation followed by overload. University of Wisconsinhistorian Alfred McCoy documented them in his book, \"A Question of Torture: CIAInterrogation, from the Cold War to the War on Terror\", calling them \"the firstreal revolution in the cruel science of pain in more than three centuries\".The CIA developed and codified them into manuals, used extensively in SoutheastAsia, Central America, Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo and at secret black sites(secret centres used for enhanced interrogation) globally to extract informationfrom suspects. In a USA Today article from the 26 April 2002 titled Ex CIA chief revitalizestruth serum debate, ex CIA and FBI Director William Webster publically advocatedthe drugging of detainees during interrogation. “Former CIA and FBI Director William Webster said Thursday that the UnitedStates should consider administering “truth drugs” to uncooperative al-Qaeda andTaliban captives at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and elsewhere to try and obtain moredetails about terrorist operations. Speaking to a small group of reporters here,Webster said the use of drugs such as sodium pentothal or other invasive tacticsshort of torture might make US agents more effective in penetrating al-Qaeda’sworldwide network. “We ought to look at what options are out there.” The psychological principles of these interrogation techniques are grounded inthe work of Ewen Cameron; “In 1963, CIA had synthesized many of the findings from its psychologicalresearch into what became known as the KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KUBARK_Counterintelligence_Interrogation]handbook.,which cited the MKULTRA studies, and other secret research programs asthe scientific basis for their interrogation methods][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#cite_note-shock-doc-ch1-114]Cameron regularly traveled around the U.S. teaching military personnel about histechniques (hooding of prisoners for sensory deprivation, prolonged isolation,humiliation, etc.), and how they could be used in interrogations. Latin Americanparamilitary groups working for the CIA and U.S. military received training inthese psychological techniques at places like the School of the Americas[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_the_Americas].” [101][part0000_split_023.html#_edn101] It has been alleged that the CIA never really stopped with its experimentationand continually strives to refine its techniques. According to the groupPhysicians for Human Rights, as presented in their paper, Experiments inTorture: Human Subject Research and Experimentation in the “Enhanced”Interrogation Program [http://phrtorturepapers.org/?dl_id=9]: “Medical professionals gathered and collected data on the CIA’s use of torture[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture] techniques on detainees, in order torefine those techniques, and to \"to provide legal cover for torture, as well asto help justify and shape future procedures and policies\", according to a reportby Physicians for Human Rights[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicians_for_Human_Rights]. The report statedthat: “Research and medical experimentation on detainees was used to measure theeffects of large-volume waterboarding and adjust the procedure according to theresults.” As a result of the waterboarding experiments, doctors recommendedadding saline [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline] to the water “to preventputting detainees in a coma or killing them through over-ingestion of largeamounts of plain water.” Sleep deprivation tests were performed on over a dozenprisoners, in 48-, 96- and 180-hour increments. Doctors also collected dataintended to help them judge the emotional and physical impact of the techniquesso as to “calibrate the level of pain experienced by detainees duringinterrogation\" and to determine if using certain types of techniques wouldincrease a subject's \"susceptibility to severe pain.\". The CIA denied theallegations, claiming they never performed any experiments, and saying \"Thereport is just wrong\"; however, the U.S. government never investigated theclaims.”[102] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn102] The CIA was completely aware that it was engaged in illegal activity in thetesting of techniques and substances and even went so far as to caution itsemployees over maintaining secrecy. In an internal memo to CIA Inspector GeneralLyman, dated 1957, it stated: “Precautions must be taken not only to protect the operations from exposure toenemy forces, but also to conceal these activities from the American public ingeneral. The knowledge that the Agency is engaged in unethical and illicitactivities would have serious repercussions in political and diplomatic circlesand would be detrimental to the accomplishment.” The U.S. government hid these monstrous experiments as they were not onlyhorrifying, but also unethical and illegal. What is important is that thoseinvolved were prepared to transgress these rules in the pursuit of results. Thedoctors involved in the experiments and those who provided the enormous sums forfunding were prepared to covertly test members of the general public in order toadvance their clandestine agenda. Perhaps the most horrifying aspect is that thedoctors involved were, at the time, the most respected and qualified withintheir respective fields."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVEN: SHOCKING TREATMENT IN THE U.K. In the U.K., Dr. William Sargant was experimenting with patients at St Thomas’Hospital, London. Sargant was known to have been employed as a consultant to theintelligence agency MI5. He was interested in deep sleep treatment, believingthat psychological problems could be solved with physiological means and largedoses of drugs. He would use drug-induced comas for three months at a time, withsimilar periods of electroshock, as treatment for mild depression. His style wasmarkedly similar to that of Ewen Cameron. Sargant’s use of different drugs on patients appears to have begun quite byaccident. In 1940, whilst working at Belmont Hospital, Sargant was confrontedwith many examples of shell-shocked soldiers, many who had recently beenfighting at Dunkirk. A particularly traumatised soldier was essentiallycatatonic and was causing a considerable amount of worry as he had been unableto urinate for several days. Sargant prescribed a large dose of barbituratesodium amytal, in essence to try and calm the patient down. To his surprise, theman immediately became coherent, began talking to the doctor and merrilyurinated in his seat. Sargant tested this new method on other soldiers who were suffering with similarcomplaints and realised that the drugs were allowing the men to relive theirmemories, allowing a catharsis of emotion known in hypnotic circles as‘abreaction’. This allows for the patient to finally deal with and work throughthe emotional trauma that they had been repressing as it was, at the time, tooterrible to face. Sargant used hypnotic suggestion techniques on the sedatedsoldiers to enable them to more vividly relive their experiences. Sargant alsoexperimented with other drugs such as ether and amphetamines. These substancesseemed to have favourable results in evoking an abbreactive response from thepatient. His work on the use of sodium amytal was published in the BritishMedical Journal the Lancet, eliciting a congratulatory letter from Dr. John Reesat the Tavistock Institute. A second paper on the subject was allegedly advisedagainst by Rees, lest the information fall into the wrong hands. Evidence of a combined U.S./U.K. truth drug experimentation programme wasexposed in a CIA document dated 22 June 1948. The document mentions sodiumamytal and states its use “was considered only in top echelon cases”. Thedocument does seem to suggest that British Intelligence made intermittent use ofthese truth drugs. William Walters Sargant (24 April 1907 - 27 August 1988) studied medicine at StJohn's College, Cambridge[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John%27s_College,_Cambridge] and qualified as adoctor at St Mary's Hospital, London[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary%27s_Hospital,_London]. His ambition to bea physician was thwarted by a nervous breakdown, after which he turned hisattention to psychiatry. Having trained at the Maudsley Hospital[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maudsley_Hospital], he worked at the SuttonEmergency Medical Service during World War II[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II]. In 1948 he was appointed as theDirector of the Department of Psychological Medicine at St Thomas' Hospital[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Thomas%27_Hospital], London and remained thereuntil (and after) his retirement in 1972. During this time Sargant was alsotreating patients at other hospitals, building up a highly lucrative privatepractice in Harley Street and working as a media psychiatrist. Descriptions of the conditions endured by the patients of Dr. Sargant at StThomas’ have been less than charitable: “It had one ward, a fearful place of drugged screams and troubled mumblings. Itwas here that Sargant, the son of a wealthy and staunchly Methodist family,began to experiment with what he called \"heroic doses of drugs used in differentcombinations. He would use these to turn Anne White, a woman desperately seeking his help,into that zombie-like figure her father saw when she emerged from his \"care\". For him, her depression was a chemical event. The invisible, choking substancethat leaches out the spirit, he would say, was the result of some electrolyticimbalance in the brain. While he would concede that each depression, like flakesof snow, are not alike, \"they are all formed on the template of pastexperience\". To eradicate that past -- however important it would be for a patient -- becamethe ultimate driving force behind William Sargant's methods.”[103][part0000_split_023.html#_edn103] William Sargant wrote The Battle for the Mind, one of the first books thatdetailed brainwashing. In this he stated; “Various beliefs can be implanted in many people after brain function has beensufficiently disturbed by accidentally or deliberately induced fear, anger orexcitement. Of the results caused by such disturbances, the most common one istemporarily impaired judgement and heightened suggestibility. Its various groupmanifestations are sometimes classed under the heading of “herd instinct” andappear most spectacularly in wartime, during severe epidemics and in all similarperiods of common danger, which increase anxiety and so individual and masssuggestibility.”[104] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn104] Researcher Gordon Thomas suggests that Sargant was connected directly to MKULTRA; allegedly Sargant made a deathbed confession as to his involvement withMI6. By all accounts during his time at St Thomas’, Sargant was spectacularlyindiscreet and often serenaded the young staff nurses with James Bond-esquetales of his espionage riddled adventures. Indeed, Ewen Cameron often soughtadvice on his own experiments from Sargant. Sargant once wrote to Cameron withthe encouraging sentiment, “Whatever you manage to achieve, I thought of itfirst”. “Sargant had a vision, bordering on messianic zeal, that he would leadpsychiatry into a new world. His weapons would include epileptic formconvulsions, induced by the drug penterazol and electroshock; hypoglycaemiccoma, produced with insulin; psychosurgery and pre-frontal leucotomy. Heoutlined his methods in his book, \"Physical Methods of Treatment\". It becamerequired reading for his growing number of medical followers in Britain andAmerica.”[105] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn105] Sargant was particularly taken by the behaviourist entraining of Pavlov who,after cutting holes in their faces, trained dogs to salivate on the sound of adinner bell. The dinner bell denoted food for the animals but Pavlov found thaton the expectation of food alone, on the chiming of the dinner bell, the dogssalivated, a physical response to external stimuli. This is known as classicalconditioning. During the experiment, the room containing the dogs flooded. Thedogs panicked, fearing that they would drown, desperately swimming to stay abovewater level. Upon finding his dogs, who had all survived, Pavlov discovered aninteresting development. The dogs memories had been wiped of their previousconditioning, the trauma experienced had reduced the dogs to a blank slate. “Three distinct and progressive states of trans marginal inhibition wereidentified by Pavlov, The first is the equivalent phase, in which the braingives the same response to both strong and weak stimuli. The second is theparadoxical phase, in which the brain responds more actively to weak stimulithan to strong. And the third is the ultra-paradoxical phase, in whichconditioned responses and behaviour patterns turn from positive to negative orfrom negative to positive. With the progressions through each phase, the degreeof conversion becomes more effective and complete. The ways to achieveconversion are many and varied, but the usual first step in religious orpolitical brainwashing is to work on the emotions of an individual or groupuntil they reach an abnormal level of anger, fear, excitement or nervoustension. The progressive result of this mental condition is to impair judgmentand increase suggestibility. The more this condition can be maintained orintensified, the more it compounds. Once catharsis or the first brain phase isreached, the complete mental takeover becomes easier. Existing mentalprogramming can be replaced with new patterns of thinking and behaviour.” “If a complete sudden collapse can be produced by prolonging or intensifyingemotional stress the cortical slate may be wiped clean temporarily of its morerecently implanted patterns of behaviour, perhaps allowing others to besubstituted more easily.”[106] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn106] He was, in 1970, also working closely with Louis Jolyon ‘Joly’ West, chairman ofthe Department of Psychiatry at the University of California in Los Angeles anddirector of its Neuropsychiatric Institute. Louis West would famously give anelephant an overdose of LSD, killing the poor animal. This was recorded in thepaper: West, L.J., Pierce, C.M., & Thomas, W.D. Lysergic acid diethylamide: Itseffects on male Asiatic elephant. Science, 138, 1100-1103, 1962. Joly West was also employed as a psychiatrist for Jack Ruby, the man who shotLee Harvey Oswald, the alleged, and almost certainly innocent, assassin of JFK.West claimed that Jack Ruby had shot Oswald by mistake, in the throes of aparticularly violent epileptic fit. Louis Jolyon ‘Joly’ West was an American[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States] psychiatrist[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist], reported human rights[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights] activist[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activist] and was considered by the U.S.government to be an expert on brainwashing[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainwashing], mind control[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_control], torture[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture], substance abuse[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse], post traumatic stress disorder[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_traumatic_stress_disorder] and violence[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence]. West has been connected to the military industrial complex since the very startof his career; he enlisted in the U.S. Army[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Army] shortly after entering the Universityof Wisconsin–Madison[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison]. In theArmy Specialized Training Program he studied at the University of Iowa[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Iowa] and the University ofMinnesota [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Minnesota], School ofMedicine, from which he graduated in 1948. He then made the career move to theU.S. Air Force [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Air_Force] Medical Corps[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Medical_Corps]. Five yearslater, West was appointed to the post of Chief of Psychiatry Service at theLackland Air Force Base, San Antonio [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio],Texas [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas]. This position allowed him to studyU.S. pilots and veterans [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans] who hadreportedly experienced torture [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture] andbrainwashing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainwashing] as prisoners in theKorean War [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War]. At the young age of 29, West was appointed as Professor[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor] and Head of the Department ofPsychiatry, Neurology and Biobehavioral Sciences at the University of Oklahoma[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oklahoma], School of Medicine. Westholds the honour of being the youngest man to have held a chairmanship inpsychiatry in the United States. In 1969 he was appointed as Head of Department and Director of theNeuropsychiatry Institute at UCLA [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA]. Hisresearch covered many fields including studies conducted on such topics asalcoholism [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism], hallucinatory drugs[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination], sleep deprivation[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation], violent behaviour, the hippie[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie] culture and the construction andorganisation of cults [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult]. During the 1960’s, West could also be found in the Haight-Ashbury section of SanFrancisco, studying the ‘hippie’ in their natural environment. A proposed project of West’s in the late 1960’s and early 1970’s was thecreation of the Centre for the Study and Reduction of Violence. He proposed tobegin a ‘securely fenced’ centre at the abandoned Nike missile base in the SantaMonica Mountains to conduct studies into the modification of behaviour for thegreater good of society. The centres would study the cause and possible ‘cures’for violent and anti social behaviour. West’s plans for such centres became the subject of official hearings by a U.S.Senate Committee in 1974. The hearings were chaired by Senator Sam Ervin who,along with other members of the hearing, was alarmed at the proposals of West.Reports show that he planned to test his bizarre methods of the modification andmanipulation of human behaviour at these centres. Methods listed in plans forthe centres include the use of drugs, electro-shock treatment, forciblecastration with the drug cyproterone acetate and also experiments concerning theimplantation of electrodes in the brain. Other proposed sites chosen for West’s hypothetical violence treatment centresincluded Vacaville, Camarillo and Atascadero state hospitals. It has been welldocumented that both drug and radiation experiments were conducted by the CIA atVacaville. Through his relationship with West, Sargant was able to procure entire ranges ofnew and exciting substances to test on unsuspecting subjects. “Using his highly placed connections to the American drug industry, Sargant’sarsenal of mind-altering drugs was unequalled in Britain. He was the first totreat patients with Thorazine, Stelazine and Mellaril; anti-depressants likeElavil and Tofranil; anti-manics like lithium carbonate. He gave them incombinations and was known to issue, “heroic” doses. Sargant worked closely withEli Lilly and Company, Hoffman-La Roche and Geigy. Other drug houses whoregarded him with favour were Merck, Sharp and Dohme, Parke-Davis and Company,Smith Kline & French Laboratories, and Searle Laboratories…He scoured the psychiatric journals for news of new drugs. His files included anadvertisement from the Archives of General Psychiatry. It showed a dark skinned,thick-lipped young man, fists clenched. Above the figure are the words\"Assaultive and Belligerent?\". Beneath the figure is the message: \"Cooperationoften begins with Haldol (haloperidol). It acts to control assaultive,aggressive behaviour. For Sargant drugs were \"the chemistry of liberation\".[107][part0000_split_023.html#_edn107] Sargant also used narcosis, that is to say, chemically induced sleep in order toprepare the patient for his stripping away of undesired patterns. Every so oftenthey were awoken with electro-convulsive therapy in order to break up thenegative patterns of the patient. Sargant admitted that at least four patientsdied whilst under narcosis. At military bases in Britain, including Maresfield, near Brighton, he conducteddrug-related experiments on so-called ‘military volunteers’. Other drugexperiments were performed at Britain’s most secret chemical and biologicalwarfare establishment at Porton Down on Salisbury Plain. Again, so called‘volunteers’ from military mental hospitals and military prisons were used.Observers from the American intelligence agencies were sent to view the resultsof these tests. Biochemist Frank Olson, and Sidney Gottlieb, the overall head ofthe MK ULTRA programme, were among those spectators. The two men became friendswith Sargant and, in return for access to patient records at St. Thomas’s, theyalso shared the results of their own research being carried out at Fort Detrick,Maryland. An account of the treatment of one patient is given by Gordon Thomas in hispaper: Inside the sleep room. Thomas tells the story of Anne White, sent to StThomas’ with postpartum depression. There she was introduced to Sargant. “He decided that the young mother was a suitable case for the Sleep Room.Sargant's Sleep Room was modelled on the one Ewen Cameron had created in theAllan Memorial Institute as part of the MK-ULTRA programme. It was at the backof Sargant's department; a dormitory with six single beds. Each was a foot apartand a low-wattage bulb barely provided sufficient light for the nurses to beable to see.”[108] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn108] Injected with Largactil and Seconal to keep her in a drugged sleep, Anne wasplaced in the Sleep Room. There she received doses of other drugs, Amitriptylineand Nardil. This was what life was like for her over the ensuing weeks: \"I don't ever remember being taken to a bathroom or lavatory, although that musthave happened. Unfortunately I was so drugged up that every time I stood; Ipassed out, because my blood pressure dropped into my boots. I don't remembertalking to any patients. I could just see the next bed but no details. When Ireached the point that the medication wouldn't keep me asleep, however much theygave me, I lay in the dark with virtually no auditory input. I think I rememberlistening to tapes. But I can't be sure and that may be something which is afalse memory.\"[109] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn109] This was Sargant’s version of the psychic driving, as practiced by Ewen Cameron,using speakers placed in the pillows of the patient’s beds. In between lying in the Sleep Room, Anne White was repeatedly taken to atreatment room for electroshock. She later discovered she had been given twentysix bi-lateral shock treatments. The recommended number is no more than six. Anne recalled: \"I was placed in a small room by myself. I was left to my own devices while Iwent through a week of barbiturate withdrawal. The nurses hardly bothered withme. I was the one who had dared to challenge the system. I felt I was beingpunished.\" It was only years later, long after she had left St Thomas's Hospital, that AnneWhite, the \"zombie-like creature\" that so shocked her father, began to discoverthe truth about William Sargant. He was the psychiatrist who had appeared forthe defence in the trial of Patty Hearst in 1976, when he had told the courtthat Patty was \"an unwilling victim of brainwashing\". When she went in search,she found her case notes had disappeared from St Thomas's shortly afterSargant's death on August 27, 1986. Her efforts to find them have failed. Butthe memory of what she endured remains as fresh today after three decades.”[110][part0000_split_023.html#_edn110] An account of the treatment that William Sargant was using was given to the U.K.newspaper The Daily Mail by the actress Celia Imrie. Celia developed an eatingdisorder after being told she was too big to become a successful ballet dancer.She recalled: “I became sly. I worked out every way to dispose of food. I was so successful atit that soon I was little more than a carcass with skin. Desperate now, my parents decided to send me away to St Thomas' Hospital inLondon, to enter one of the special wards belonging to the Department ofPsychological Medicine. And once there I was placed under the care ofworld-famous psychiatrist William Sargant. I was 14. Even then, Sargant was a world expert on brainwashing. Today his books are saidto be studied by Al Qaeda. His work has links to the mysterious death of CIAbiochemist Frank Olson after being given LSD; the Jonestown massacre in Guyana,where 900 people killed themselves; and to the mind-bending and occasionallylethal drug experiments performed on unwitting human guinea pigs at the PortonDown research centre in Wiltshire. Sargant's methods were simple: electric-shock treatment and insulin-inducedcomas leading to continuous narcosis, or deep-sleep therapy, complete withtaperecorded 'brainwashing' orders being played at the patients from beneaththeir pillows. And to think that all this came free on the NHS! At 14, I was the youngest in the ward. Most of the other patients weremiddle-aged women suffering from depression. From my bed, I watched themhowling, moaning and screaming, fighting with the nurses. I thought: 'I don'twant to be mad. I must get out of here. Sargant still features in my nightmares. He was brusque and cold, and he nevertalked directly to you. Instead he issued orders over your head, talking about'this one' and 'that one'. But that was preferable to making eye contact withthis proud, incorrigible man with his dark, hard, evil eyes. After Sargant left the ward, the nurses would start preparing the horrors he hadprescribed for the day - the electro-convulsive therapy. Friends have asked whatit was like to have electrodes put either side of your skull before huge surgesof power were fired through your brain, while you squirmed and wrestled andshrieked and moaned and dribbled into the pillow. But the truth is I don'tremember. I do, however, remember vividly watching the woman in the next bed when it washer turn to be assaulted in the name of health. I remember every sight, soundand smell. The huge rubber plug jammed between her teeth; the strange almostsilent cry, like a sigh of pain; the shuddering contortions and jerky gyrationsof the tormented body; the scent of burning hair and flesh.” Celia also described the rooms dedicated to Sargant’s deep sleep therapy, allaided with his ‘heroic’ doses of drugs; “I remember also the famous Narcosis Room, a ward where patients were forcedinto a drug-induced sleep for days while tapes played instructions to them fromunder the pillow. Whenever I have been asked about Sargant's Narcosis Room, I can describe itperfectly. I used to sneak out of the ward to peer through the portholes in theswing doors, and gaze at dead-looking women lying on the floor on greymattresses, silent in a kind of electrically induced twilight. But it recently occurred to me that everyone, in order to be put into theNarcosis Room, would first be drugged and that although I saw many women comeback to the ward from there, I never saw any patient emerge from the placeawake. You went in asleep and you came out asleep. It is probable, I realise now, that I did go in. Like the electric shocks, Ipresume it definitely happened to me, though I can only recall it happening toothers. I was certainly injected with huge doses of insulin. These injectionsare now understood to be one of the methods Sargant used to kick-start his sleeptherapy process. I cannot know whether his mindcontrol methods worked on me as I do not know whatthe tape recordings under my pillow were telling me to do. Unfortunately, my search was in vain. When Sargant left St Thomas', he illegallytook away all his patients' records. By the time of his death in 1988, everysingle piece of paperwork about his inhumane treatment of us, the human guineapigs, had been destroyed. So I will never know the absolute truth. I do recall being given massive doses, three tumblers a day, of Largactil, ananti-psychotic drug. The effect of this drug was startling. My hands shookuncontrollably for most of the day and I'd wake up to find clumps of my hair onthe pillow. But the worst consequence was that everything I saw was multipliedby four. When Sargant came into the room, I saw four of him. It was horrific andterrifying. Even simple tasks such as picking up a glass of water becameimpossible. The drugs had turned me into a victim. As she increased the dosage one day, I overheard one nurse saying to her seniorthat I was exhibiting a 'dangerous resistance' to the drugs. Dangerous for whom,I wonder? Sargant used to say that every dog has his breaking point - the eccentrics justtook longer. I suppose my 'dangerous resistance' was what he was talking about.I like to think that I was one of those eccentric dogs he did not manage tobreak.”[111] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn111] This last statement of Sargant’s, “every dog has his breaking point” isparticularly telling, showing his veneration of Pavlov and also his completedisregard for human beings. Sargant believed that these people were mereobjects, puzzles that could be manipulated at will. Written in 1963 by members of the CIA, the KUBARK CounterintelligenceInterrogation manual details the most effective methods by which to break downthe human psyche. The manual drew on the results of the experimentation carriedout by MK ULTRA doctors in the 1950’s; principally, the manual recommendsestablishing the subject’s sense of self and then stripping it away throughpsychological means.The suggested tactics include keeping detainees naked in order to instill asense of alienation and discomfort. Sexual humiliation was also recommended,particularly if the subject was shy (or, as seen in recent military campaigns,if the subject has religious sensibilities that can be manipulated). The centralconcept involved in breaking the psyche is to keep the detainee uncomfortable,disorientated and isolated. The manual encourages placing subjects in small,windowless cells with constant artificial light to achieve this; this isstrangely reminiscent of most office-based working environments, although I amsure this is just a happy coincidence. The practice of forcing detainees tomaintain painful stress positions to physically exhaust them is advised, as thisonly adds to the subject’s mental exasperation. The manual also makes referenceto the use of drugs, hypnosis and torture with electricity, advising that theinterrogators should ensure the room chosen for the task has a working supply. Taken from the KUBARK document, the connection to the experiments of Cameron andSargent are clear: “A. The Nature of Counterintelligence Interrogation The long-range purpose of CI interrogation is to get from the source all theuseful counterintelligence information that he has. The short-range purpose isto enlist his cooperation toward this end or, if he is resistant, to destroy hiscapacity for resistance and replace it with a cooperative attitude. Thetechniques used in nullifying resistance, inducing compliance, and eventuallyeliciting voluntary cooperation are discussed in Part VIII of this handbook. Obviously, many resistant subjects of counterintelligence interrogation cannotbe brought to cooperation, or even to compliance, merely through pressures whichthey generate within themselves or through the unreinforced effect of theinterrogation situation. Manipulative techniques - still keyed to the individualbut brought to bear upon him from outside himself - then become necessary. It isa fundamental hypothesis of this handbook that these techniques, which cansucceed even with highly resistant sources, are in essence methods of inducingregression of the personality to whatever earlier and weaker level is requiredfor the dissolution of resistance and the inculcation of dependence. All of thetechniques employed to break through an interrogation roadblock, the entirespectrum from simple isolation to hypnosis and narcosis, are essentially ways ofspeeding up the process of regression. As the interrogatee slips back frommaturity toward a more infantile state, his learned or structured personalitytraits fall away in a reversed chronological order, so that the characteristicsmost recently acquired - which are also the characteristics drawn upon by theinterrogatee in his own defence - are the first to go. As Gill and Brenman havepointed out, regression is basically a loss of autonomy.” Two further CIA interrogation manuals came from the work of Sargant and Cameron,namely Coercive Questioning and Human Resources Exploitation. These manualsrecommend and describe the most effective methods of ‘legal’ torture to be usedagainst prisoners by the U.S. Military. Techniques include water boarding,stress positions maintained for hours, sleep deprivation, verbal intimidationand threats of violence and death. The Human Resources Exploitation manual alsoadvises on the use of electrodes for applying shocks to the hapless interviewee.The Human Resource Exploitation training manual has been used in at least sevenU.S. training courses conducted in Latin American countries, including Honduras,between 1982 and 1987. Coercive Questioning details the use of fear in order tobreak the will of the subject, “The threat to inflict pain can trigger fearsmore damaging than the immediate sensation of pain. Threats delivered coldly aremore effective than those shouted in rage”. The document warns against,“Delivering the threat of death against hard-headed types who realise thatsilencing them forever would defeat the interrogators purpose. They must bebroken by other procedures”. The use of hypnosis is also discussed; “Hypnosis offers one advantage over other interrogation techniques or aids: theposthypnotic suggestion. It should be possible to administer a drug to aresistant source in food or drink and persuade him, as a drug takes effect andhe is slipping into a hypnotic trance, to shift his frame of reference so thathis reasons for resisting become reasons for cooperating. Interrogate him andconclude the session by implanting the suggestion that when he emerges from histrance he will not remember anything about what has happened…Drugs can beeffective in overcoming resistance not dissolved by other techniques. Thejudicious use of a drug, matching the subject’s personality, careful gauging ofdosage and a sense of timing make its administration a hard to equal ally forthe interrogator. One of the interrogator’s functions is providing the doctorwith a full and accurate description of the psychological make-up of theinterrogatee. Persons burdened with feelings of shame or guilt are more likelyto unburden themselves when drugged, especially if these feelings have beenreinforced by the interrogator.” Both doctors employed what came to be known as deep sleep therapy, drugging thepatients and only waking them to traumatise with electrical shocks, LSD, loopedtapes of their own voices or a combination of the techniques. After the clearlytraumatic experience, the patients were forced back into a sleeping state.Recent research has, however, discovered that this may in fact compound andextend the psychological trauma of the patient. It seems that it is morebeneficial to psychologically process a traumatic event so that you canconsciously come to terms with the event. Sleeping too soon after a traumaticevent seems to lock in the initial trauma without giving the brain chance todeal with the emotional response. “Sleeping after a traumatic event might lock in bad memories and emotions[http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=141kpkiih/EXP=1328213419/**http%3A/abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/researchers-discover-biological-pathway-linked-ptsd/story%3Fid=12972887],a new study has found. Researchers from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst asked more than 100healthy adults to rate their emotional responses to a series of images, somedepicting unsettling scenes. Twelve hours later, they rated the images again.The difference: Half of the subjects slept during the break; the other half didnot. \"Not only did sleep protect the memory, but it also protected the emotionalreaction,\" said Rebecca Spencer[http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=125j3qiiu/EXP=1328213419/**http%3A/www.psych.umass.edu/people/rebeccaspencer/],a neuroscientist at UMass Amherst and co-author of the study that was publishedin the Journal of Neuroscience[http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=11dbpqtsl/EXP=1328213419/**http%3A/www.jneurosci.org/]. Study subjects who stayed awake for 12 hours had a weaker emotional response tothe unsettling images the second time around, suggesting sleep serves topreserve and even amplify negative emotions. Their memories were also weakerthan those of their well-rested counterparts, as they struggled to rememberwhether they had seen the images before. \"It's true that 'sleeping on it' is usually a good thing to do,\" said Spencer,citing evidence that sleep boosts memory and other cognitive functions. \"It'sjust when something truly traumatic or out of the ordinary happens that youmight want to stay awake.\" Spencer said people often find it difficult to sleep after a traumatic event. \"This study suggests the biological response we have after trauma might actuallybe a healthy,\" she said. \"Perhaps letting people go through a period of insomniabefore feeding them sleeping meds is actually beneficial.\"[112][part0000_split_023.html#_edn112] Whether this was known to Cameron and Sargant at the time of theirexperimentation can only be speculated on. Sargant’s methods also show the willingness for established and respectedmembers of the medical profession to experiment secretly on the public inpursuit of their new science. What is more important is the similarities in themethods employed by both Sargant and Cameron. The use of essentially the sametechniques and the sharing of results seem to prove the collaborative efforts ofthe U.K. and American Intelligence Agencies. Despite evidence showing that theseso called ‘theraputic’ techniques were actually extremely harmful to thepatient, the experiments were continued so that the nature of coercive methodscould be fully exploited."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHT: VICTIMS The creation of mind controlled persons who could be induced to steal, plantbombs and even attempt murder, has been shown at an experimental stage throughthe published results of experimentation by the perpetrators themselves.However, as further evidence we also have the revelations of alleged victims ofthis process. An explanation of the methods employed in the creation of mind controlledassassins was given by Colonel William Bishop, who in 1983 spoke to researcherGary Shaw; “That was how, after the Korean war, I got involved with the CIA. I have beensubjected to every known type of drug. The medical doctors connected with theagency found that certain drugs work quite well in conjunction with hypnosiswith some subjects. It did with me. I speak with absolute certainty andknowledge and experience that this is not only possible, but did and is takingplace today. I never understood why they selected me personally. There were anynumber of psychological or emotional factors involved in people’s selection.Antisocial behaviour patterns, paranoid or the rudiments of paranoia and so on.But when they are successful with this programming – or for lack of a betterterm indoctrination- they could take John Doe and get this man to kill Georgeand Jane Smith. He will be given all the pertinent information as to theirlocation, daily habits etc. Then there is a mental block put on this mission inhis mind, he remembers nothing about it. Perhaps a month or a year later … thephone rings. A code word will be read to him in a voice that John Doerecognizes. That will trigger the action. John Doe will commit theassassination, return home and remember absolutely nothing of it.” Within days of releasing this statement, Colonel Bishop died of heart failure. It has been said that Michael Ryan received a phone call from his therapistimmediately prior to donning full combat gear and going on a robotic gun totingrampage, namely the Hungerford massacre. As we have heard from those involved in the manufacture of assassins, the key isto create dissociative identities in the mind of the subject. Colin Ross is apsychiatrist and mind control researcher, specializing in dissociativedisorders. He wrote: “The basic premise of the book The Manchurian Candidate is that a group ofAmerican POWs in the Korean War is brainwashed while crossing through Manchuriato freedom. They arrive back in the US amnesic for the period of brainwashing,and one of them has been programmed to be an assassin. His target is a candidatefor president of the US. His Asian handlers control him with a hypnoticallyimplanted trigger, a particular playing card. Multiple personality disorder is now classified by the American PsychiatricAssociation as dissociative identity disorder. According to my definition, theManchurian Candidate is an experimentally created dissociative identity disorderthat meets the following four criteria: Created deliberately, a new identity isimplanted; amnesia barriers are created, used in simulated or actualoperations”[113] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn113] The concept of mind controlled slaves has actually been recorded in open court.Claudia Mullen spoke before a U.S. presidential advisory committee investigatinggovernment radiation experiments in March 1995. In this hearing she made someastonishing admissions as to her involvement in government sponsored mindcontrol experimentation. The story of her victimisation was told in greatdetail; “Between the years 1957 and 1984, I became a pawn in the government’s game. Itsultimate goal was mind control and to create the perfect spy, all through theuse of chemicals, radiation, drugs, hypnosis, electric shock, isolation in tubsof water, sleep deprivation, brainwashing, verbal, physical, emotional andsexual abuse. I was exploited unwittingly for nearly three decades of my lifeand the only explanations given to me were that the ends justifies the means andI was serving my country in their bold effort to fight communism. I can onlysummarise my circumstances by saying they took an already abused seven year oldchild and compounded my suffering beyond belief. The saddest part is, I know fora fact that I was not alone. There were countless other children in my samesituation and there was no one to help us until now. I have already submitted asmuch information as possible including conversations overheard at the agenciesresponsible. I am able to report all of this to you in such detail because of myphotographic memory and the arrogance of the people involved. They were certainthey would always control my mind. Although the process of recalling theseatrocities is not an easy one nor is it without some danger to myself and myfamily, I feel the risk is worth taking.” Mullen exposed Dr. Sidney Gottlieb and members of the Technical Service Divisionof the CIA as being the primary architects of her abuse. Mullen recalled thatone of her government tormentors had a Scottish accent and was taken to callingher ‘lassie’. She described him to her therapist Valerie Wolf. Valerie Wolflater happened to be watching a collection of stock footage showing CIA doctorsand was astonished to see a doctor who looked exactly as Mullen had described,calling female patients ‘lassie’. This doctor was none other than Ewen Cameron. Mullen’s exposé continued; “Dr. L. Wilson Greene received $50 million dollars from the Edgewood Chemicaland Radiology Laboratory as part of the TSD, or Technical Science Division ofthe CIA, once described to Dr. Charles Brown that \"children were used assubjects because they were more fun to work with and cheaper too. They neededlower profile subjects than soldiers and government people so only young willingfemales would do. Besides,\" he said, \"I like scaring them. They in the Agencythink I am a God, creating subjects in experiments for whatever deviant purposesSid and James could think up\" (Sid being Dr. Sidney Gottlieb; James is Dr. JamesHamilton). In 1958, I was to be tested, they told me, by some important doctors coming froma place called the 'Society' [the Human Ecology Society, a CIA front]. I wastold to cooperate; answer any of their questions. Then, since the test 'mighthurt,' I would be given 'shots, x-rays, and a few jolts of electricity.' I wasinstructed not to look at anyone's face too hard and to ignore names,' as thiswas 'a very secret project' but to be brave an all those things would help meforget... A Dr. John Gittinger tested me and Dr. Cameron gave me the shocks and Dr. Greenethe x-rays...By the time I left to go home, just like every time from then on, Iwould recall nothing of my tests or the different doctors. I would only rememberwhatever explanations Dr. Robert G. Heath [of Tulane Medical School] gave me forthe odd bruises, needle marks, burns on my head and fingers and even the genitalsoreness. I had no reason to believe otherwise. Already, they had begun tocontrol my mind! The next year I was sent to a lodge in Maryland called Deep Creek Cabins tolearn how to sexually please men. I was taught how to coerce them into talkingabout themselves. It was Richard Helms, who was Deputy Director of the CIA, Dr.Gottlieb, Capt. George White, Morse Allan who all planned on filling as manyhigh government agency officials and heads of academic institutions andfoundations as possible so that later when the funding for mind control andradiation started to dwindle, projects would continue. I was used to entrap manyunwitting men including themselves, all with the use of a hidden camera. I wasonly nine years old when the sexual humiliation began. Another time I heard Dr. Martin Orne, who was the director then of theScientific Office and later head of the Institute for Experimental Researchstate that \"in order to keep more funding coming from different sources forradiation and mind control projects\", he suggested stepping up the amounts ofstressors used and also the blackmail portions of the experiments. He said, \"itneeded to be done faster then to get rid of the subjects or they were asking forus to come back later and haunt them with our remembrances. There is much more I could tell you about government sponsored researchincluding project names, sub project numbers, people involved, facilities used,tests, and other forms of pain induction, but I think I have given more thanenough information to recommend further investigation of all the mind controlprojects, especially as they involved so much of the use of the radiation. I would love nothing more than to say that I dreamed this all up and need tojust forget it. But that would be a tragic mistake. It would also be lie. Allthese atrocities did occur to me and to countless other children, and all underthe guise of defending our country. It is because of the cumulative effects ofexposure to radiation, chemicals, drugs, pain, subsequent mental and physicaldistress that I have been robbed of the ability to work and even to bearchildren of my own. It is blatantly obvious that none of this was needed, norshould ever have been allowed to take place at all, and the only means we haveto seek out the awful truth and bring it to light is by opening whatever filesremain on all the projects, and through another Presidential Commission on MindControl. I believe that every citizen of this nation has the right to know what is fact,and what is fiction. It is our greatest protection against this ever happeningagain. In conclusion, I can offer you no more than what I have given you today-- the truth. And I thank you for your time. The way I got involved was I was adopted when I was two and a half years old bya woman who sexually abused me, and then she was a friend of the Chairman of theBoard of Tulane University at the time. As a favour ... I began to exhibitsymptoms of typical childhood abuse beginning very young and she asked him torecommend a child psychiatrist and it was Dr. Heath who was involved....dissociate and that I had almost perfect recall and I passed all the personalitytests that they gave me. Heath suggested me for the project. That's how I gotinto it. My father had no idea. He died when I was very young, but I don't knowif my mother knew or not. I don't think she really cared to tell you the truth.Then she died when I was a teenager so ... after that they had access to me fromthen on.” A statement to Dr. Wolf that was included in her testimony to the president'scommittee was written by well-known researcher and psychiatrist, Dr. Colin Ross.Based on over two decades scrutinising the CIA’s involvement in mindexperimentation, Ross stated, “Published articles in my files include descriptions of administration of 150mcg of LSD to children age 5-10 years on a daily basis for days, weeks, months,and in a few cases even years. Neurosurgeons at Tulane, Yale, and Harvard didextensive research on brain electrode implants with intelligence funding, andcombined brain implants with large numbers of drugs includinghallucinogens.”[114] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn114] Claudia's therapist, Dr. Wolf, wrote to the President's Committee; \"To the best of my knowledge, [Claudia] has read nothing about mind-control orCIA covert operations. Since she decided to listen carefully and remember asmuch as she could about conversations among the researchers, her memories areextraordinarily complete. I have sent written copies of memories to Dr. AlanScheflin [author of The Mind Manipulators] for validation and he has confirmedthat she has knowledge of events and people that are not published anywhere thatsome of her memories contain new information and that some are already known andpublished. Some of her memories have been confirmed by family members. She hasalso shown me old scrapbooks where she wrote notes to remember what washappening to her and hid the notes under pictures in the scrapbook. Dr. Wolftold me that when word got around she was going to testify before thepresident's committee, she was contacted by about 40 therapists \"in just the 10days leading up to my trip to Washington.\" The therapists had heard similar CIAmind-control stories from their own patients. Many of these professionals areafraid to go on the record about their patients' stories, as censure from theirprofessional societies is a reality. The political mood these days is notconducive to granting an aura of credibility to revelations of CIA brainwashing.\" [115] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn115] Since the Presidential Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments met on15 March 1995, former President Clinton has apologized and compensated some ofthe victims of the radiation experiments. Christine DeNicola was another victim of abuse who spoke at this committee. Shespoke very candidly about her involvement in government experiments and beingtrained with the ultimate goal of becoming a programmed assassin. Committee member Dr. Duncan C. Thomas, a professor at the University of SouthernCalifornia, questioned: “Can I ask either of you where were your parents through all this? Do you haveany idea how you were recruited in the first place? Did you have parents? Didyour parents know anything about what was going on?” Christine DeNicola answered: “I can make a brief statement on that. It was my father who was involved withDr. Greene. My mother was not aware because they were divorced when I was fouryears old, before that ... separated. What would happen, how he gained access tome is that these experiments actually took place in the middle of the night, andhe would sneak in while my Mom was asleep, take me out and she had absolutely noknowledge of what happened. However, when these memories did surface, and Ibegan to tell her about them, there was no question in her mind that he wascapable. He had been in the military, in the Air Force. He had access to meetDr. Greene, so in answer to your question, it was my father. He groomed me fromthe very beginning, started sexually abusing me from the very beginning and itwas just something that he wanted to do and he was closely involved with Dr.Greene, but my Mom had no knowledge. The only thing she knew was that she wantedto get away from him. She didn't know why. She just knew she had to get awayfrom him because of my reaction to him. I am sorry; I didn't mean to go on.Thank you. I was a subject in 1966 to 1976. Dr. Greene performed radiation experiments onme in 1970 focusing on my neck, throat and chest. 1972 focusing on my chest andfocusing on my uterus in 1975. Each time I became dizzy, nauseous and threw up.All these experiments were performed on me in conjunction with mind controltechniques and drugs in Tucson, Arizona. Dr. Greene was using me mostly as amind control subject from 1966 to 1973. His objective was to gain control of mymind and train me to be a spy assassin. The first significant memory took placeat Kansas City University in 1966. Don Ebner took me there by plane when my momwas out of town. I was in what looked like a laboratory and there seemed to beother children. I was strapped down, naked, spread-eagled on a table on my back.Dr. Greene had electrodes on my body, including my head. He used what lookedlike an overhead projector and repeatedly said he was burning different imagesinto my brain while a red light flashed aimed at my forehead. In between eachsequence, he used electroshock on my body and told me to go deeper and deeper,deeper. While repeating each image would go deeper into my brain and I would dowhatever he told me to do. I felt drugged because he had given me a shot beforehe started the procedure. I was four years old. I was taught how to pick locks, be secretive, use my photographic memory and atechnique to withhold information by repeating numbers to myself. Dr. Greenemoved on to wanting me to kill dolls that looked like real children. I stabbed adoll with a spear once after being severely traumatized, but the next time Irefused. He used many pain induction techniques, but as I got older, I resistedmore and more. He often tied me down in a cage, which was near his office. Between 1972 and1976 he and his assistants were sometimes careless and left the cage unlocked.Whenever physically possible, I snuck -into his office and found files withreports and memos addressed to CIA and military personnel. Included in thesefiles were project, subproject, subject and experiment names with some codenumbers for radiation mind-control experiments which I have submitted in mywritten documentation. I was caught twice and Dr. Greene tortured me ruthlesslywith electric shock, drugs, spinning on a table, putting shots in my stomach, inmy back, dislocating my joints and hypnotic techniques to make me feel crazy andsuicidal...\""},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINE: PRESIDENTIAL MODELS Two of the most prominent victims of mind control are Cathy O’Brien and BriceTaylor, who both tell similar stories. They both claim to have come fromfamilies of intergenerational abuse, the environment of incest and prostitutionbeing particularly conducive for causing dissociative personalities. The pairallege that as children and adults they were used by celebrities and dignitariesas personal sex slaves and believe that, when infants, they were used in childpornography. They both make claims of being tortured for mind control purposesat military bases across America. Cathy O’Brien was used as a mind controlled prostitute by the CIA before she wasrescued and deprogrammed by her now partner, Mark Phillips. At the time of herrescue she was purportedly being used as a prostitute by such luminaries asGerald Ford, Dick Cheney, George Bush, Bill and Hilary Clinton and many more.She alleged that those mentioned were also involved in paedophilia and murder.This is documented in two books, Trance Formation of America and For Reasons ofNational Security, in which she charts her life from a family background ofincest, ritual abuse and mind control and into the hands of paedophiliccelebrities and politicians. “I was born in 1957, in Muskegon, Michigan, to a multi-generational, incestbased family. My father had been sexually abused as a child, my mother had beensexually abused as a child, and they were sexually abusing me. As far back as Ican remember, my father was sexually abusing me. And I've often heard them bragthat he began substituting his penis for my mother's nipple while I was still aninfant. This confused my primitive sexuality. It put it into an area of puresurvival. It was the same, to me, as eating and drinking. It was for this reasonthat I was targeted as a sex slave in the MKUltra project.”[116][part0000_split_023.html#_edn116] “I know I am extremely fortunate to have survived my CIA MKUltra mind controlvictimization. I know I am extremely fortunate to have survived to this point,to be able to relay this information to all of you. Many government secrets andpersonal reputations were staked on the belief that I could not be deprogrammedto remember those things that I was supposed to forget. They were wrong. Theynever considered the strength of the human spirit. They never considered whatwould happen when a good man like Mark Phillips found out their secrets and usedthem for good: used them for the betterment of humanity, used them to restore amind and a memory, rather than to destroy one and control one.”[117][part0000_split_023.html#_edn117] She asserts that she was used as a ‘presidential model’ top level government sextoy and also as a personal computer, using her photographic memory and abilityto be hypnoprogrammed. “This kind of photographic memory certainly had the interest of the government,because they knew that Dissociative Identity Disorder children, such as myself,were highly suggestible and could be easily programmed photographically todeliver messages, as it were. In my case, since I had been sexually abused, Iwas used as a sex slave, and therefore my suggestible mind was programmed tocarry out and fulfil perversions of certain politicians who did not want theirperversions known to the rest of the public. They truly believed that theirsecrets would be kept secret forever. Had I not been expertly deprogrammed, Iwould not ever have been able to think to tell you about what happened, and whatI witnessed, as a White House/Pentagon level mind controlled slave.”[118][part0000_split_023.html#_edn118] O’Brien has made several public appearances which have been recorded and areavailable to watch on the internet. In these, she maintains that at the toplevel there are no party lines for politicians, government is a charade and thesecret rulers of society are far more nefarious than you had previouslyimagined. She has a daughter, Kelly, who she claims is still under mind controland in danger as a target for the paedophilic lusts of the power elite. O’Brienhas several marks and scars on her body which she attributes to stun guns usedin the mind control process. She also has a carving on her genitals which sheclaims she received in a ritual scarification. Brice Taylor began to recover memories after she was thrown through a windscreenin a car crash in 1985. She began deprogramming her memories and piecingtogether her past in 1988, continuing with daily therapy sessions for six years.Brice has claimed her personality was shattered from an early age by the sexualabuse of her father, who she believes was also a mind control victim. This wascompounded by being sold into pornography and prostitution, combined with thetrauma of being used in satanic ritual that sometimes involved her beingimpregnated and the foetus then being removed at around three months. Taylorbelieves that she was ‘owned’ and hypnotically controlled by popular comedianBob Hope, who she claims used entertainment as a clever cover for his espionagetype activities. She says “Entertainment was just a clever hobby of his. Iwitnessed his participation as a strategically placed, influential andintegrated part of an underworld group that secretly sort to control the world.He maintained direct ties to the White House.” [119][part0000_split_023.html#_edn119] She was also purportedly taken to many parties at Hugh Hefner’s house andprostituted to Hollywood celebrities. As an adult she became a ‘presidentialmodel’ which is essentially a sex toy for diplomats, politicians and captains ofindustry. She names Henry Kissinger as the owner of her mind files, meaning shereported matters of espionage directly to him. She also claims that Ted Kennedyabused her and was involved in mind control projects, meaning if theseallegations are true, that his 1977 investigation (exposing the de-classifieddocumentation of MK ULTRA) was a fraud. “I was used extensively on and around 1968 by top politicians…guaranteed by theCentral Intelligence Agency that my training in Project Monarch…insured thehighest level of security. The level of mind control I possessed guaranteed thatI could be used with these leaders who were involved at the highest levels ofnational security without my own awareness.”[120][part0000_split_023.html#_edn120] A validation of Taylor’s story comes from researcher Walter Bowart, author ofOperation Mind Control, who recalls seeing Taylor at a charity event in PalmSprings in the company of Bob Hope, working as a hostess and aide to him. Otherphysical evidence is provided by the numerous wounds and possible stun gun marksthat adorn her body. Brice has written two books detailing her life, Starshineand Thanks for the Memories and has made numerous DVD presentations, often withTed Gunderson, exposing those involved with her torture. She also has a daughterstill caught up in this horrifying situation. Cathy O’Brien and Brice Taylor both have very similar stories which on the faceof it are very bizarre; this does not mean that they are not true. Whenspeaking, both Brice and Cathy seem very believable and do not sway from theiroriginal story. There is some strangeness surrounding the pair however, as inher second book, For Reasons of National Security, Cathy O’Brien tries todiscredit Taylor, saying that her story is not an accurate recall of events butrather an invented memory. Brice has in return claimed this is the influence ofCathy’s deprogrammer Mark Phillips, who, having previously worked in a positionthat brought him into contact with the CIA, she believes is still Cathy’shandler. This causes a lot of disparity in cases where there is little thatcould constitute evidence or even a smoking gun. The strongest point of evidencein these cases is that the celebrities and politicians accused of drug abuse,murder and child sex have not sued for libel, slander or defamation ofcharacter, possibly as they dare not risk a court case in which ‘the truth’could be exposed. I would advise that you examine the information and come toyour own conclusions."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TEN: CHILDREN AND THE ELITE The Franklin child prostitution ring allegations were a series of high-profileaccusations and legal actions between 1988 and 1991, surrounding an allegedchild sex ring [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_of_children] servingprominent citizens of Omaha, Nebraska[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska], as well as high-level U.S.politicians. Children were reportedly taken from the local charity organizationBoys Town, in order to service the predilections of its members. The allegationscentred on the alleged activities of Lawrence E. King, the director of theFranklin Community Federal Credit Union in Omaha. King was also a prominentlocal political figure and rising star within the Republican Party. In 1984Lawrence King personally sang the National Anthem at the Republican National GOPConvention. King was convicted of defrauding huge amounts of money from thecredit union and served time in prison for this crime. The more alarming aspectof the case however were the stories that those involved were using children inprostitution scenarios and traumatising them to induce multiple personalities. Paul Bonacci testified before a jury in the case. He named men, whom he alleged,had sexually and physically abused him. This was in the Omaha area and othersites across the U.S.A. that were connected to the credit union fraud. He namedLarry King as the principle abuser and the architect of a prostitution ringinvolving children to be used by local figures of prominence. He was initiallyindicted on charges of perjury as his story was not officially believed. In 1999he won a $1 million law-suit against Larry King with the help of his lawyer JohnDeCamp, ostensibly clearing his name and confirming his accusations of abuse. Paul Bonacci claims to have met Lawrence King in Sarpy County in 1980, where hestates King performed satanic ritual abuse on him. In 1982 Paul was flown toBohemian Grove, a secretive all-male get away in the woods of California, whereyearly occult ceremonies are said to be performed by the world’s elite. Thiscompound was infiltrated by journalist Alex Jones and exposed in his film DarkSecrets Inside Bohemian Grove. In this he managed to clandestinely film thecremation of care ritual, where world leaders dressed in Ku Klux Klan styleregalia perform a mock immolation of a baby in front of a mock stone statue ofan owl deity which some claim is called Molech. Others claim it is arepresentation of Minerva, either way it is a little strange to say the least.This is not embellished in any way, this place exists, these ceremonies happenand the elite attend. It is an all-male affair and often male prostitutes andporn stars are brought to the grounds. President Nixon described the place as“God damn faggy!”. Whilst being used as a prostitute for the movers and shakers of the Americanelite, Bonacci claimed to have seen snuff films being made at the Grove. Paulalleges that he witnessed ‘Gonzo’ journalist Hunter S. Thompson recording asnuff act for posterity. Shortly after Paul made this revelation, Hunter S.Thompson was found dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound to thehead. In his book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Thompson discusses the use of thedrug adrenochrome. In the book he explains that his companion, Dr. Gonzo, alawyer, had received a stash of this drug as payment from a client in lieu ofcash. The drug is an extract taken from the adrenaline gland of a living humanbeing. The client in question was reportedly a Satanist. The implication is thatthe drug was harvested during a ritual sacrifice. Paul Bonacci was initially charged with perjury and sent to jail for making‘false’ accusations under oath about the Franklin affair and the connections tochild sex and kidnapping. Bonacci has however since been awarded a $1 millionjudgment against Lawrence King and the people who abused him. This court rulingshows that essentially, Paul was telling the truth. Senior U.S. District Judge Warren Urbom said the judgment for Paul Bonacci, 31,was a ‘fair amount’ for mental and physical injuries Bonacci attributed to U.S.government mind control programmes. On 27 February 1999, U.S. District CourtJudge Warren Urbom found former Franklin S&L manager Lawrence E. King guilty ofnumerous crimes committed against Paul Bonacci. King, who was at the timealready serving a fifteen year sentence for his role in the theft of fortymillion dollars from the Franklin credit union, was ordered by Judge Urbom topay Bonacci $800,000 in compensatory damages and an additional $200,000 inpunitive damages. In the Memorandum of Decision, Judge Urbom wrote, \"King continually subjected the plaintiff [Bonacci] to repeated sexual assaults,false imprisonment, infliction of extreme emotional distress, organized anddirected satanic rituals, forced the plaintiff to 'scavenge' for children to bea part of the defendant King's sexual abuse and pornography ring, forced theplaintiff to engage in numerous sexual contacts with the defendant King andothers and participate in deviate sexual games and masochistic orgies with otherminor children.\" He [Bonacci] has suffered burns, broken fingers, beatings ofthe head and face and other indignities by the wrongful actions of the defendantKing. In addition to the misery of going through the experiences just relatedover a period of eight years [1980-1988], the plaintiff has suffered thelingering results to the present time. He [Bonacci] is a victim of multiplepersonality disorder, involving as many as 14 distinct personalities aside fromhis primary personality. He has given up a desired military career and receivedthreats on his life. He suffers from sleeplessness, has bad dreams, hasdifficulty holding a job, is fearful that others are following him, fearsgetting killed, has depressing flashbacks, and is verbally violent on occasion,all in connection with the multiple personality disorder and caused by thewrongful activities of the defendant King.\" Paul gives even more candid information in a recorded interview with the lateFBI agent Ted Gunderson, speaking openly of the nature of his different ‘alter’personalities, his time as a child prostitute serving the elite includingPresident Bush and how he was employed by agencies within the U.S. government tosteal children to order. I would highly recommend watching the Ted Gundersoninterview and the Yorkshire TV documentary Conspiracy of Silence to get abroader picture of the case. Yorkshire Television recorded Conspiracy of Silence, exposing the way Boys Townwas involved and explicitly stating that the traumatised and mind controlledchildren were used as prostitutes in order to serve and entrap, for blackmailpurposes, top level politicians and institutional leaders. The Conspiracy ofSilence [http://educate-yourself.org/products/index.shtml#cos] film was due tobe aired in the United States on the Discovery Channel in May of 1994; justprior to its intended airing, the programme was pulled by the Discovery Channel.Sometime later John DeCamp, Paul Bonacci’s solicitor, received a copy throughthe post from an unknown source and he made it available on the internet.Yorkshire Television was allegedly ordered to destroy all copies. Paul Bonacci claimed that he and other children were tortured for the specificpurpose of creating multiple personalities within them. These multiplepersonalities could then be programmed as desired; Paul alleges these childrenare used as spies, drug mules, prostitutes, or assassins. Paul himself wasreportedly used as a child prostitute and also as a lure, to help draw childreninto the path of his CIA handlers. These children were allegedly then sold intopaedophilic prostitution rings. One boy, who Paul claims to have helped discover for a client and help kidnap in1982, was paperboy Johnny Gosch, a high profile case of child abduction thatreceived national attention in America. Johnny was snatched off the street byunknown assailants. Johnny’s mother Noreen, having spoken with Paul said, “Paul Bonacci testified in his civil suit that he was one of the people whohelped kidnap Johnny. He was the first to sexually molest Johnny. He told all ofthe gruesome details. The judge asked, \"Why did they want Johnny Gosch when theycould have their pick of a lot of runaway kids?\" Bonacci looked at the judge andtold him, \"Johnny fit the profile of what they were looking for. They sell kidsto paedophiles who want certain kids with certain features\".” According to recent spoken and written reports from Paul Bonacci and alsopurportedly Johnny Gosch himself, speaking through his mother, Johnny was stolenaway by a highly organized, global child pornography ring. Johnny was allegedlysubjected to severe trauma and torture that was both satanic and sexual innature. The purpose of this trauma was to intentionally destroy his personality.In February 1999, in a Federal Court testimony in Omaha Nebraska, Noreen Goschtestified that Johnny Gosch came to see her in 1997, providing information abouthis experience, asking for his mother's help and pleading for her to not revealthe details of his visit. Bonacci testified that they had followed Johnny on nights when he was cominghome from school and had photographed him; those photographs were put in acatalogue book from which a ‘customer’ picked him out. When Johnny was abducted, he was reportedly taken to a farmhouse and kept therefor two weeks. After those two weeks, Johnny was sold for an unknown amount ofmoney. A man they called ‘the Colonel’, came and took Johnny away, reportedly toColorado. Paul Bonacci identified that man as Col. Michael Aquino. MichaelAquino is the highest ranking military officer in the NSA. He wrote thepsychological warfare paper From Psy-Ops to Mindwar and is also the leader ofthe Temple of Set. This is an offshoot from Anton Laveys Church of Satan, whichAquino felt was not quite satanic enough for his personal tastes. Johnny Gosch later appeared bound and gagged on a Russian child sex website; inthe pictures there were other unknown boys also hog-tied and terrified. Bonacci tells a harrowing tale of how the children were frightened intoremaining silent, reported by Alex Constantine in his book Psychic Dictatorshipin the USA; “Mendenhall: Did you believe they would kill somebody? Bonacci: They did. Mendenhall: Who did they kill? Bonacci: It was in California…We picked up Nicholas who went out with us andwhen we got there, I don’t know where we landed or where we were at; they had metied and drugged up. They took us out to a place and all I can remember is thatthere was a Kern River or something that went by; there was a bridge that had aname on it. It was near there that we would wait. And they had this little boythat was in a cage…First they told us we better do what they told us. They toldus we’d better do what they told us or they’d kill us too. So we did everythingthey told us.”[121] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn121] It has been suggested that this was one of the killings that Hunter S. Thompsonrecorded. Lawrence King has never been charged with any crime relating to abduction ormolestation, although more than seventy children have come forward claimingremarkably similar stories to that of Paul. Those children were all discreditedand the entire case was proclaimed an elaborate hoax. Paul refused to change hisstory and was subsequently charged with perjury. However, records show that theGrand jury, “found probable cause to believe that King…used money or items ofvalue to entice, inveigle, persuade, encourage or procure men in their lateteens or early twenties to engage in acts of prostitution.” This was, however,never addressed in the case itself. Alicia Owen, a friend of Paul, claimed that the Omaha police chief made herpregnant whilst using her as a child prostitute. She took a polygraphexamination, overseen by the FBI and passed with flying colours. The concept of using mind controlled children for sex, and then in turn usingthis to blackmail influential figures, reared its head in February 2011. Thisscandal rubbed shoulders with the British Royal Family and a wealthy friend ofPrince Andrew with a less than auspicious background. The story concerns an underage girl who came from a background of abuse. Shebecame a runaway and through desperation, a street prostitute. Later the girlreturned to her family and was introduced to a series of elite businessmen andmovers and shakers of society. Here she got a job (immediately) as an exoticmasseuse for the billionaire Jeffery Epstein, a friend and business associate ofBritains Prince Andrew. As reported in the British press, “Virginia Roberts. Her shocking account of her four years as Epstein’s personalmasseuse is supported by court documents, an eyewitness, photographs and flightdetails of Epstein’s private jets. Born in Sacramento, California, in August 1983, Virginia spent her early yearson a small ranch on the West Coast of America. This seemingly idyllic childhood ended when she was sexually molested by a manclose to her family. The fallout from that led to her parents temporarily splitting up. Blamingherself, Virginia began to get into trouble aged 11, she was sent to live withan aunt but repeatedly ran away. Living on the streets, she was beaten up and slept with at least two older menin return for food. ‘I was a paedophile’s dream,’ she says.” After returning home, Virginia got a part-time job as a changing room assistant(at Donald Trump’s country club, Mar-a-Lago) which is where, soon after her 15thbirthday, she met Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of media mogul Robert Maxwell, whoinvited her to work as Epstein’s personal masseuse. “I was wearing my uniform – a white miniskirt and a skin-tight white polo top –when I was approached by Ghislaine,” Virginia says. “I told her I wanted to become a masseuse and she said she worked for a verywealthy gentleman who was looking for a travelling masseuse.” Epstein has previously sidestepped child sex charges; “He has so far made 17 out-of-court settlements, and some cases are ongoing. Oneof these girls was to have been a key witness for the prosecution had the casegone to trial. She was just 15 years old when she was drawn into Epstein’sexploitative world in 1998. Epstein, a Wall Street money manager who oncecounted Bill Clinton and Donald Trump among his friends, became the subject ofan undercover investigation in 2005 after the stepmother of a 14-year old girlclaimed she was paid $200 (£125) to give him an ‘erotic massage’. The subsequent FBI probe uncovered at least 20 girls leveling sexual allegationsagainst him. Eventually, Epstein struck a ‘plea bargain’ with prosecutors – apractice not permitted under British law – under which he was allowed to pleadguilty to two relatively minor charges. Police claim that his donations to politicians and his ‘dream team’ ofinfluential lawyers deterred prosecutors from bringing more serious charges ofsex-trafficking. The deal certainly kept the names of a lot of Epstein’s famousfriends out of an embarrassing court case.\" Virginia was later allegedly, whilst under seemingly incredible control, pimpedout to elite clients by her new boss. \"In her civil writ against him, under the pseudonym Jane Doe 102’ she allegedthat her duties included being ‘sexually exploited by Epstein’s adult male peersincluding royalty. “Basically, I was training to be a prostitute for him and his friends who sharedhis interest in young girls,” she says: “After about two years, he started toask me to “entertain” his friends.” She spoke of being a prostitute for wealthy and influential people andrecruiting other underage girls for the same task. The language used also(possibly) suggests a degree of mind control. Certainly it shows the strippingaway of the ego that we see in cases of prostitution; \"He didn’t spell out what I had to do. He didn’t have to. He’d trained me to dowhatever a man wanted. I was shocked but I told myself he was sharing me aroundbecause he trusted me and I was special. I was worried, but I would do anything to keep Jeffrey happy and to keep myplace as his number one girl. He would keep telling me how lucky I was with the life I was leading and themoney I was making. It was easy to fall into his grasp. ‘The way it usually worked was I’d be sent to meet a man on the private islandJeffrey owned in the Caribbean, or at his ranch in New Mexico, which was reallyisolated.’ She was ‘given’ to men ranging in age from their 40s to their 60s.They included a well-known businessman (whose pregnant wife was asleep in thenext room), a world-renowned scientist, a respected liberal politician and aforeign head of state. None appeared to think the arrangement was unusual.Virginia says there were many other girls in Epstein’s circle and that she waspaid extra money to help recruit them.\" What I found interesting is that Epstein has a mansion in Mexico. People likePaul Bonacci and even serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, spoke of transportingchildren across the border for prostitution. Is this the case here? Henry LeeLucas claimed to be a mind control victim himself. He also made the claim thathe was a hired killer, transporting drugs and children for the assassinationsquad, ‘The Hand of Death’, a satanic cult with connections to elite members ofsociety and the U.S. government. As outlandish as this may seem, several of thedrug and murder factories that he spoke about have been discovered. Many ofthese camps also have been found to contain ritual sites and other evidences ofhuman sacrifice. For more information read The Hand Of Death by Max Call, whichdetails Henry’s exploits or Programmed to Kill by Dave McGowan, which elaborateson the story. The article continues, \"Epstein’s pink mansion on the Palm Beach waterfront – he also owns anine-storey home in New York, the city’s biggest private residence; a 7,500-acreranch called ‘Zorro’ in New Mexico and Little Saint James, a private 70- acreatoll in the US Virgin Islands.” She also mixed with celebrities and high level politicians; \"I met famous friends of his such as Al Gore and Heidi Klum and Naomi Campbell.He introduced me as his “travelling masseuse.” The article, published in a mainstream British newspaper, states: \"There is no suggestion that there was any sexual contact between Virginia andAndrew, or that Andrew knew that Epstein paid her to have sex with his friends. However, the Prince must have been aware of Epstein’s conviction when he stayedwith him in New York in December.\" [122] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn122] A later article which appeared in The Village Voice makes claims that therelationship with the Prince was a little more hands on: “When Roberts was 17, she says she sat on the Prince's lap, along with anothergirl, 21, while Andrew played with a life-size puppet of himself: She said Miss Maxwell made Virginia sit on Andrew's other knee and then she 'putthe puppet's hand on Virginia's breast, then Andrew put his hand on my breast'. She added: 'It was a great joke. Everybody laughed.' The 'joke' earned Virginia$400 from Epstein.”[123] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn123] All of those that met Virginia must have been aware that this girl was ateenager, who was described as looking ‘young for her age’. It also transpired that the houses where the underage girls were being pimpedout were set up with cameras to record the encounters. This smacks of theblackmail plots that Brice Taylor and others spoke about; entrapment andsubsequent blackmail of the well positioned, in order to make them do yourbidding. \"They said they had found photos of me at Jeffrey’s Palm Beach house,’ she says.‘[Epstein had] hidden cameras watching me the entire time even when I was in thebathroom.\" Virginia took the sedative Xanax to detach herself from sordid reality. “It wasan escape drug,” she disclosed. “It made me calm and helped me forget about whatI had to do. I was up to eight pills a day”. Epstein had no objection to Virginia’s use of prescription drugs, no doubtrecognising that they made her even more malleable. “I didn’t want to go back tothe life I’d had before”. “That made me totally obedient”. Despite the fact that Epstein was, essentially,her pimp, this life now seemed normal to Virginia. ‘I felt that he and Ghislainereally cared for me”.[124] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn124] Epstein recently returned to his home in New York after being released from aFlorida jail, having served only 18 months. This short sentence was included aspart of a plea deal in which he confessed to two counts of solicitingprostitution."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVEN: MILITARY REVELATIONS In addition to individual claims of mind control victimisation, publicrevelations by those claiming to have orchestrated large scale indoctrinationprogrammes lend much credence the ‘myth’ of the ‘Manchurian Candidate’.Lieutenant Commander Dr. Thomas Narut accidentally admitted to U.S. Navy-runpsychological programmes to create mind controlled assassins. This was to agroup of journalists at a NATO conference on Dimensions of Stress and Anxiety inOslo, Norway. According to Narut this involved use of the Ludovico technique, asseen in the Stanley Kubrick film A Clockwork Orange. This would be used todesensitize the soldiers to visions of extreme violence and also to programme aconcentrated and homicidal, xenophobic hatred of other cultures. Thisover-stimulating visual bombardment was combined with a regime of sleepdeprivation and continuous blasts of looped sounds and would last about fourweeks. The Navy issued a swift withdrawal of the previous statements at a pressconference that was arranged at breathtaking speed; however the allegations wereconfirmed by Dr. Irwin Sarascin, who claimed to have also worked on similarprojects for the U.S. Navy.The statements of Dr. Thomas Narut were reprinted in British newspaper TheTimes;“A U.S. Navy psychologist claims that the Office of Naval Intelligence had takenconvicted murderers from military prisons, used behaviour modificationtechniques on them, and then relocated them in American embassies throughout theworld. Just prior to that time, the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee hadcensured the CIA for its global political assassination plots, including plotsagainst Fidel Castro. The Navy psychologist was Lt. Commander Thomas Narut ofthe U.S. Regional Medical Centre in Naples, Italy. The information was divulgedat an Oslo NATO conference of 120 psychologists from the eleven nation alliance. According to Dr. Narut, the U.S. Navy was an excellent place for a researcher tofind \"captive personnel\" whom they could use as guinea pigs in experiments. TheNavy provided all the funding necessary, according to Narut.Dr. Narut, in a question and answer session with reporters from many nations,revealed how the Navy was secretly programming large numbers of assassins. Hesaid that the men he had worked with for the Navy were being prepared forcommando-type operations, as well as covert operations in U.S. embassiesworldwide. He described the men who went through his program as \"hit men andassassins\" who could kill on command.The assassins were conditioned through \"audio-visual desensitization\". Theprocess involved the showing of films of people being injured or killed in avariety of ways, starting with very mild depictions, leading up to the moreextreme forms of mayhem. Eventually, the subjects would be able to detach theirfeelings even when viewing the most horrible of films. The conditioning was mostsuccessful when applied to \"passive-aggressive\" types, and most of these endedup being able to kill without any regrets. The prime indicator of violenttendencies was the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. Dr. Narut knewof two Navy programming centers, the neuropsychiatric laboratory in San Diegoand the U.S. Regional Medical Center in Italy, where he worked.”During the NATO conference in Oslo, Dr. Narut explained that the reason he wasdivulging this incredible information was because he believed that the knowledgeof the intelligence agencies secret methods would soon be common knowledge. Dr.Narut was seemingly referring to the recent disclosure by a Congressionalsubcommittee, which were then appearing in the press concerning various CIAassassination plots. However, what Dr. Narut had failed to realize at the timewas that details of the manner or method of assassination plots was not to beunearthed and would apparently remain, officially, a fantasy.“The techniques of psychotherapy widely practiced and accepted as a means ofcuring psychological disorders, are also methods of controlling people. They canbe used systematically to influence attitudes and behavior. Systematicdesensitization is a method used to dissolve anxiety so that the patient(public) is no longer troubled by a specific fear, a fear of violence forexample. [...] People adapt to frightening situations if they are exposed tothem enough”.[125] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn125] An increasingly large number of people are coming forward, claiming to bevictims of mind control. Obviously some accounts are more convincing than othersand some are sadly mere delusions of a troubled mind. However, the increasingnumber of alleged victims, combined with the broad spectrum of backgroundspresented by these witnesses, means that much of this evidence cannot be easilydismissed."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVE: MANCHURIAN CANDIDATES?Sirhan Sirhan, world famous assassin, did not actually remember shooting SenatorRobert Kennedy, stating “I did it without trying”. He left mysterious notebooksin his place of residence with the repeated phrase “MIND CONTROL” and variousother strange, recurring scrawling. When put under a hypnotic trance, Sirhandispassionately repeated the phrase “Prepare and practice, mind control, mindcontrol, mind control”. Dr. John Heisse, Dr. Albert Spiegel and several othersconcluded upon examination that Sirhan was under hypnotic suggestion during theassassination of Robert Kennedy and did not consciously know what he was doingor what had transpired. Heisse noted that Sirhan could put himself into a trancestate, which is something he would only have been able to do if taught by anexperienced hypnotist. Sirhan exhibited what has been described as ‘superhuman’ strength when arrested;indeed it took several men to wrestle the slight character to the floor. One ofthe men attempting to overpower Sirhan during the shooting, George Plimpton, wasamazed that Sirhan's eyes were \"dark brown and enormously peaceful\" during thestruggle. Another man in the same position, Joseph Lahaiv, described Sirhan aslooking \"very tranquil\" as he was being manhandled to the ground. Two waiters,Vincent Di Pierro and Martin Patruski, reported that Sirhan appeared to besmiling during the attempts to wrestle him into submission. A cook named YosioNiwa said, \"I'll never forget that guy's face...I was so upset...he wassmiling”. As Sirhan was taken from the scene, a policeman shone a torch into Sirhan's eyesto check for signs of drugs or alcohol. On the stand at Sirhan's trial, thepoliceman in question \"couldn't recall\" what he determined. However, in anearlier statement he had affirmed that Sirhan's pupils \"didn't react\" to thelight and that they \"were real wide\". The official records from Sirhan's bloodtest were lost by the Los Angeles Police Department so unfortunately we cannotdetermine if he was, or was not, drugged in any way. Sirhan was seen in theAmbassador Hotel prior to the assassination “staring fixedly” at a teletypemachine, as if in a kind of trance. According to the operator, he was alsodissociative; “he came over to my machine and started staring at it, juststaring. I’ll never forget his eyes. I asked him what he wanted and he didn’tanswer”. When interviewed about the fateful evenings events, Sirhan’s recollection wascloudy: “Sirhan: \"It was hot that night and I was very thirsty. I remember that....Iwent to the bar and had four drinks within about 15 minutes. I couldn't seem toget enough to drink....They were Tom Collins's.... (but) I wasn't drunk. I feltdrugged. I think somebody slipped something into my drinks. My legs and armsbecame rubbery. I remember standing by my car but I couldn't drive so I wentback inside and got some coffee.\" Reynolds: \"How did you get downstairs to the pantry?\" Sirhan: \"Somebody guided me. I don't know who.\" Reynolds: \"Did you have your gun with you?\" Sirhan: \"Yes. When I was in the pantry, the gun was in my hand.\" Reynolds: \"Did you know Robert Kennedy was going to be walking toward you?\" Sirhan: \"No. I didn't know where I was and I don't know how I got there. I wasin a state of blackout.\"[126] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn126] After his arrest, police discovered that Sirhan had the extraordinary ability totell the time, accurate to the minute, with no watch or clock. This isreminiscent of the extended senses of someone who has been hypnoticallyprogrammed. Sirhan’s lawyer Larry Teeter had to file a lawsuit in order to preserve thepantry where Kennedy was shot for further forensic examination, despite thisbeing usually standard practice in a crime scene. He later asserted; “There was no way Sirhan Sirhan killed Kennedy. He was the fall guy. His job wasto get busted while the trigger man walked out. He wasn’t consciously involvedin any plot. He was a patsy. He was unconscious and unaware of what washappening – he was the true Manchurian Candidate.” Charles McQuiston, a high ranking U.S Intelligence officer also raised hissuspicions about the case. He said; “Someone else was involved with the assassination and Sirhan was programmedthrough hypnosis to kill RFK. What we have here is a live Manchurian candidate.” Larry Teeter stated: “I know it was done. It was consistent with the USgovernment’s programme developed by the CIA and Military Intelligence to enablehandlers to get people to commit crimes with no knowledge of what they aredoing.” William Turner and Jonn Christian hypothesized in The Assassination of Robert F.Kennedy that Dr. William Joseph Bryan, Jr. was responsible for inducing SirhanSirhan [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirhan_Sirhan] to fire blank shots atRobert F. Kennedy [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy], with the useof posthypnotic suggestion[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posthypnotic_suggestion]. Bryan had worked on CIAmind control programme MK ULTRA and claimed to have moonlighted as a technicaladviser on The Manchurian Candidate film. Other conspiracy theorists haverepeated this claim as to Bryan’s involvement in the assassination. Bryan diedbefore he could sue for libel, which apparently he intended to. William Joseph Bryan, Jr. has been described as “a pioneering American hypnotist[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnotism]” and was obviously very skilled in hisfield. He is famous for inducing Albert DeSalvo[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_DeSalvo]'s (the alleged Boston Strangler)confession to multiple homicides whilst under hypnosis (some that he could nothave possibly, physically carried out - now that’s what you call a result!). Heran the American Institute of Hypnosis, edited his own journal and created theBryan method of hypnoanalysis. Bryan was found dead in a Las Vegas[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas,_Nevada] hotel room in 1978. He hadeither shot himself or was murdered. The case remains unsolved and adds anotherlayer of intrigue to the Sirhan Sirhan episode. The hypnosis of Sirhan, it is suggested, had been done over three months, aperiod in Sirhan’s life known as the ‘white fog’. The Los Angeles policetask-force investigating the assassination used hypnosis to try and construct ameticulous timetable of Sirhan’s activities up to the shooting. This was fairlysuccessful, although there was a three month period that was impenetrable, as ifsome kind of memory block had been employed. Sergeant Bill Jordan, the detective who was Sirhan’s first interrogator,recalled; “We took him back for more than a year with some intensity – where he’d been,what he’d been doing, who he’d been seeing. But there was this 10- or 12-weekgap, like a blanket of white fog we could never penetrate, and which Sirhanhimself appeared to have a complete amnesia about.” This period coincides with three months in 1967, during which time Sirhan wentmissing and was untraceable to his family. Upon his return he had no explanationof his whereabouts but he did harbour a new and deeply held fascination with theoccult. The autopsy itself suggests that the killer of Robert Kennedy was someone otherthan Sirhan, the fatal wound being a close range shot behind the ear. Sirhan wasdirectly in front of Kennedy when he shot and after firing only two bullets, wasoverpowered by the horrified onlookers. Also, Sirhan fired eight bullets intotal, all that his gun had the capacity to hold (six whilst being wrestled tothe ground) and yet mysteriously, an alleged total of fourteen were found lodgedaround the room and in the victims at the scene. Robert F. Kennedy was killed by a gun which, due to the scorch marks it left onthe skin behind his ear and the back of his clothing, could not have been morethan two inches from his body when fired. The bullet which killed Kennedyseemingly entered his body from behind his ear and embedded itself in theceiling. Dr. Thomas Noguchi's autopsy \"showed RFK was hit by four bullets, all of whichwere fired from behind at upward angles; five others were wounded by separateshots\"; Dr. Noguchi's autopsy \"did not point to Sirhan as the killer\".Furthermore to this, an eyewitness, DeWayne Wofler \"testified that the bulletsfired at RFK had come from an entirely different gun\", not Sirhan's. A security guard, Eugene Cesar, standing right behind RFK, had a drawn gun ofexactly the same calibre as the alleged murder weapon; it was never examined norwas he charged or seriously questioned. In their book, The Assassination ofRobert F. Kennedy, John Christian and William Turner made a convincing case\"indicting Cesar for the crime\", concluding \"that Sirhan may have been firingblanks\". Further evidence of someone else’s involvement came from several witnesses whodescribed, “a woman in a polka dot dress” leaving the scene hurriedly, shouting\"We shot him! We shot him! We shot Kennedy!\" Some may see this decidedly unwiseoutburst as the fabled smoking gun so to speak. Recently Sirhan has begun to appeal his conviction, as reported by the U.K.newspaper The Daily Telegraph; “In a bizarre twist more than forty years after the high-profile killing,lawyers for Sirhan Sirhan, the Palestinian man convicted of the shooting, havesubmitted new evidence which they say shows their client was manipulated by themystery girl and had no sense of what he was doing. \"I thought that I was at the (rifle) range more than I was shooting at anyperson, let alone Bobby Kennedy,\" Mr Sirhan told a hypnotist hired by his legalteam to interview him about the murder. \"I didn't know that I had a gun.\" The papers, which have been filed in a federal court, suggest that Sirhan wasused as a decoy and a second person actually shot and killed Kennedy. Underhypnosis, he said that a mystery girl had let him into the pantry of the hotelwhere the shooting had taken place and had pinched him on the shoulder, agesture which he said had sent him into \"range mode.\" In that mode, all he couldsee were circles with targets in front of his eyes as if he was on a firingrange, he claimed. \"I was fascinated with her looks,\" he said. \"She never saidmuch. It was very erotic. I was consumed by her. She was a seductress with anunspoken unavailability.\" Witnesses have spoken in the past of seeing a mysterygirl running from the hotel shouting \"We shot Kennedy\" but she has never beenidentified. Sirhan was denied parole in March by a panel that said he had not shownsufficient remorse for the killing.”[127] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn127] In 2011, Sirhan Sirhan sought a release from prison and through his lawyersappealed his conviction. This was reported by CNN. “Sirhan Sirhan, convicted of the 1968 assassination of presidential candidateSen. Robert F. Kennedy, should be freed from prison or granted a new trial basedon \"formidable evidence\" asserting his innocence and \"horrendous violations\" ofhis rights, defense attorneys said in federal court papers filed this week. In a U.S. District Court brief, Sirhan's lawyers also say that an expertanalysis of recently uncovered evidence shows two guns were fired in theassassination and that Sirhan's revolver was not the gun that shot Kennedy. Attorneys William F. Pepper and Laurie D. Dusek also allege that fraud wascommitted in Sirhan's 1969 trial when the court allowed a substitute bullet tobe admitted as evidence for a real bullet removed from Kennedy's neck. The attorneys further assert that Sirhan was hypno-programmed to be a diversionfor the real assassin and allege that Sirhan would be easily blamed for theassassination because he is an Arab.” The article continued, “Sirhan \"was an involuntary participant in the crimes being committed because hewas subjected to sophisticated hypno programming and memory implantationtechniques which rendered him unable to consciously control his thoughts andactions at the time the crimes were being committed,\" court papers said.” The specter of mind control was openly discussed in the court case: “Court papers filed by Sirhan's attorneys say the state \"refuses to acknowledgethat hypno programming/mind control is not fiction but reality and has been usedfor years by the U.S. military, Central Intelligence Agency and other covertorganizations. \"Though the practices of hypno programming/mind control is hardly new, thepublic has been shielded from the darker side of the practice. The averageperson is unaware that hypnosis can and is used to induct antisocial conduct inhumans,\" Sirhan's court filings say.” Furthermore, audio evidence appears to support the concept that Sirhan could nothave acted alone, as Pepper and Dusek revealed to CNN; “An analysis of a recently uncovered audiotape of the assassination shows thatin addition to the eight gunshots fired by Sirhan's Iver-Johnson handgun; fiveother shots were fired by a second gun from the opposite direction. [Therecording] clearly showed that 13 shots were fired in the pantry, and Sirhan'sgun had only eight shots, so it definitely means there was a second shooter.” The article, transcribed onto the CNN.com website, elaborated; “The tape was made 40 feet away from the crime scene by freelance newspaperreporter Stanislaw Pruszynski and is the only known recording of the gunshotsfired in Robert Kennedy's assassination. The recording was uncovered in 2004 byCNN's Brad Johnson, who had it independently examined by two experts, SpenceWhitehead and Philip Van Praag. They concluded, individually, that more thaneight shots were captured in the tape.”[128] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn128] Sirhan’s lawyers are of the opinion that he was used as a decoy, a distractionfrom the real assassin: “For decades following the 1968 assassination, Sirhan had claimed he could notremember the Kennedy shooting. Pepper and Dusek argue this is because he was\"hypno-programmed\" to fire his gun in the pantry and to then forget theshooting, his programming and those who had programmed him. In 2008, Pepper hired a Harvard University memory expert who says he got theimprisoned Sirhan to recall the Kennedy shooting for the first time. That expert is Daniel Brown, an associate clinical professor in psychology atHarvard Medical School who submitted a statement to the parole board afterinterviewing Sirhan for 60 hours over a three-year period. Brown says Sirhan nowremembers that when he fired his shots in the pantry he believed he was at a gunrange and shooting at circular targets, according to Pepper. Brown believes Sirhan was programmed to do this so as to cause a distraction inthe pantry, allowing a second gunman to secretly shoot Kennedy from behind,according to Sirhan's attorneys. Brown is described in Sirhan's court papers as\"one of the world's foremost experts in hypno programming.\"[129][part0000_split_023.html#_edn129] In his book, The Search for the Manchurian Candidate, John D. Marks detailed theCIA's efforts to hypnotically programme people and added the following: “The veteran admits that none of the arguments he uses against a conditionedassassin would apply to a programmed \"patsy\" whom a hypnotist could walk througha series of seemingly unrelated events, a visit to a store, a conversation witha mailman, picking a fight at a political rally. The subject would remembereverything that happened to him and be amnesic only for the fact the hypnotistordered him to do these things. There would be no gaping inconsistency in hislife of the sort that can ruin an attempt by a hypnotist to create a secondpersonality. The purpose of this exercise is to leave a circumstantial trailthat will make the authorities think the patsy committed a particular crime. Theweakness might well be that the amnesia would not hold up under policeinterrogation, but that would not matter if the police did not believe hispreposterous story about being hypnotized or if he were shot resisting arrest.Hypnosis expert Milton Kline says he could create a patsy in three months; anassassin would take him six. Phrases from Sirhan's private notebooks show thecharacteristics of \"automatic writing\" of a hypnotically programmed subject andhe even makes references to mind control, money, drugs, the Occult and even thename \"Di Salvo.\"[130] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn130] Mark Chapman, the apparent assassin of former Beatle John Lennon, was \"hearingvoices\" a long time before he made that fateful journey to New York. Hecomplained to his doctors about \"the little people in his head\" and wassubsequently diagnosed as suffering from a psychosis. Chapman has stated ininterviews in the last decade that as a child he had an obsession with \"littlepeople\". One of his favourite games was to create a make-believe world fromlittle toy men that he would control, like a God-figure. He also revealed thathis inner mind was in constant conflict with this obsession; although he wantedto see himself as “the big man” (i.e. in control, all powerful), he sometimesregarded himself, to his horror, as being more like the powerless \"littlepeople\". Chapman has also revealed that this obsession with the \"little people\"came back into his consciousness later in his adult life. Interestingly, Chapmanhas also recounted many nights where he would strip himself naked and danceuncontrollably under the moonlight. Interestingly, some reports seem to show that shots fired at John Lennonpossibly came from inside the Dakota building - was Chapman another patsy toallow the true triggerman to escape? “The verbal exchange between Lennon and Chapman is critical because itestablishes that Lennon probably turned to Chapman before Chapman theoreticallybegan shooting. Lennon's turning motion is crucial because if he did in factturn, he would probably have turned in the direction of Chapman. If this was thecase, some or all of the bullets should have entered the right side of Lennon'sbody because Chapman was reportedly standing to Lennon's right, a few feetbehind him when the shooting started. But the autopsy report and deathcertificate reveal Lennon was shot four times on the left side of his body. Sohow could all four wounds be on the left side of the body if Chapman wasstanding to Lennon's right? Even more devastating, there is a strong possibilitythat Lennon did not turn at all. He simply walked straight ahead and was shottwice in the left shoulder, then shot twice more in the left side of the back ashe ran towards the lobby door.”[131] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn131] Chapman went to New York in October 1980, planning to kill Lennon, but failingto act on this urge. He returned to New York in November but, after going to thecinema and being inspired by the film Ordinary People, he returned to Hawaii,telling his wife he had been obsessed with killing Lennon but had managed to“snap out of it”. He made an appointment to see a clinical psychologist butinstead of keeping this appointment, on December 6, he took a flight back to NewYork. Incidentally, before leaving for New York the third and final time, heclocked-off from his work-shift as a security guard by signing his name into thework register. However, before leaving, he suddenly decided to scrub his nameout replaced it with another name... that being: \"John Lennon\". His intention during his final trip to New York was not only to kill Lennon, butlive out his fantasies and re-enact certain set pieces from The Catcher in theRye, as experienced by the book’s main protagonist Holden Caulfield. Whilst inNew York, Chapman visited sites that the character of Caulfield visited in thebook and stayed at the same hotels as his muse. On the morning of December 8,1980, he departed from the Sheraton Hotel, leaving a collection of personalitems in his hotel room. It would seem that he intended for the police to findthem. Chapman bought another copy of The Catcher in the Rye' from a New Yorkbook store, in which he wrote the cryptic message, \"This is my statement\" andsigned it \"Holden Caulfield\". He then spent most of the day loitering near thefront doors to The Dakota building where Lennon and Yoko Ono lived, near tocentral park. The Dakota building exterior can be seen as the setting for theRoman Polanski film Rosemary’s Baby. Chapman filled his time by talking to otherwaiting fans and the doorman of the Dakota building. During the night of 8/9 December 1980, Chapman made and signed the followingpoorly written statement while in police custody “I never wanted to hurt anybody my friends will tell you that. I have two partsin me the big part is very kind the children I worked with will tell you that. Ihave a small part in me that cannot understand the big world and what goes on init. I did not want to kill anybody and I really don’t know why I did it. Ifought against the small part for a long time. But for a few seconds the smallpart won. I asked Got to help me but we are responsible for our own actions. Ihave nothing against John Lennon or anything he has done in the way of music orpersonal beliefs. I came to New York about five weeks ago from Hawaii and thebig part of me did not want to shoot John. I went back to Hawaii and tried toget rid of my small part but I couldn’t. I then returned to New York on FridayDecember 5, 1980 I checked into the YMCA on 62nd Street I stayed one night. ThenI went to the Sheraton Center on 7th Ave. Then this morning I went to the bookstore and bought The Catcher in the Rye. I’m sure the large part of me is HoldenCaulfield who is the main person in the book. The small part of me must be theDevil. I went to the building called the Dakota.” During a BBC interview some years later, recorded by Kevin Sim and aired in atelevision film documentary The Man Who Shot John Lennon in February 1988,Chapman revealed more details. The following is an excerpt from that interview: “If you ever get the chance, go to The Dakota building. I just love thatbuilding…to think that’s where it happened. There was no emotion, there was noanger, there was nothing, dead silence in the brain, dead cold quiet. He walkedup, he looked at me, I tell you the man was going to be dead in less than fiveminutes, and he looked at me, I looked at him. He walked passed me and then Iheard in my head said, \"Do it, do it, do it,\" over and over again, saying \"Doit, do it, do it, do it,\" like that. I pulled the gun out of my pocket, I handedover to my left hand, I don’t remember aiming, I don’t remember drawing the beador whatever you call it. And I just pulled the trigger steady five times.” Before the assassination, Chapman reportedly sat in his room in Hawaii and keptchanting over and over and over: “The phoney must die says the catcher in the rye, the phoney must die says thecatcher in the rye, John Lennon must die says the catcher in the rye.” This is remarkably similar to Sirhan Sirhan, writing into his notebook that \"RFKmust be assassinated, assassinated, assassinated\". Mark Chapman had previously been submitted for treatment at Waikiki MentalHospital, which many researchers have claimed to be connected to CIA mindcontrol experiments. Records from his numerous visits to mental healthinstitutions show that Chapman began receiving hallucinatory aural instructionsto kill John Lennon from as early as 1978. It was at this time when the voicescommanding him to kill Lennon began, that he became obsessed with the novel TheCatcher in the Rye. The Catcher in the Rye has the dubious honour of being theobsession of yet another gun toting would-be killer, failed Reagan assassin JohnHinckley. Some have suggested this may have been in some way a trigger for hisactions, in the same way that the Queen of Hearts playing card induced theprogramming in The Manchurian Candidate or the manner in which Martin Orneinduced response with an ordinary yellow pencil.“He lived in Hawaii at the time,where he drank and became depressed, a condition worsened from working nights asa security guard in Honolulu. He bought a gun and flew with it, unloaded, to NewYork, eventually getting bullets from a police officer friend in Atlanta whothought they were for Mr. Chapman’s protection.”[132][part0000_split_023.html#_edn132] Chapman was an avid traveller by all accounts, taking in some very exoticlocations, including Beirut. This was during a period when coincidentally, thecapital city of Lebanon was a described as “a hive of CIA activity”. Rumourspersist that Beirut is also one of the clandestine locations for CIA trainingcamps. There is a strange discrepancy in the public portrayal of Chapman, mixingbetween low paid social inadequate to altruistic, well travelled, caringmissionary. In 1975 alone Chapman reportedly visited Japan, the U.K., India,Nepal, Korea, Vietnam and China. Many researchers have suggested that the U.S.government in some way provided the cash for this, presumably for their ownnefarious purposes. Chapman also had possible ties to the CIA through his previous work as a WorldVision Employee (World Vision Missionaries is an ‘international evangelicalorder’ that has in the past performed espionage work for the CIA). Allegedly,while working for World Vision, Chapman was trained in terrorist infested,war-torn Beirut as a ‘security guard’. World Vision has been used by the CIA oncovert operations many times. The organisation was utilized to provide atraining camp for Nicaraguan rebels in Honduras, training anti-Castro troops forthe Bay of Pigs fiasco and also murdering Palestinians at camps in Lebanon.World Vision also arrived in Guyana shortly after the Jonestown Massacre. Thisis not to say that all that World Vision does is without merit or even tar thewhole organisation with the brush of being a CIA front. What is clear though isthat hiding nefarious actions behind a charity would be an excellent espionagetactic, as the public image of said organisation would reduce suspicion and evenevoke disbelief if uncovered. After the shooting of Lennon and his subsequent arrest, Chapman remained in atrance-like state for days. Auditory hallucinations from God were required toprompt him into a confession of the shooting as he had no memory of the events.His peculiar state of calm after the murder and during arrest was notquestioned. His behaviour was not checked by the police with a drugs test,despite his demeanour being described by more than one police officer asresembling a ‘programmed’ state. Chapman’s previous movements were investigated,although admittedly in a particularly slapdash manner. Lieutenant Arthur O’Connor recalled; “I saw him within half an hour of his arrest. I was the first one to interrogatehim. He was in a daze, composed but not there. He gave me the impression he haddone something: something he had to do and he had done it. It’s possible Mark could have been used by somebody. I saw him the night of themurder and studied him intensely. He looked as though he could have beenprogrammed the way he looked and the way he talked. It could have been drugs andno, we did not test for drugs. Put simply, the authorities’ investigation, or lack of it, into theassassination was shockingly slack and beggars belief.” O'Conner stated that; \"It is definitely illogical to say that Mark committed the murder to makehimself famous. He did not want to talk to the press from the very start. Itspossible Mark could have been used by somebody. I saw him the night of themurder. I studied him intensely. He looked as if he could have beenprogrammed.\"[133] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn133] The doorman on duty at the Dakota Building on the night John Lennon was shot wasnamed José Perdomo. Although not well known, his background seems to imply thathe may be a person who merits further questioning as to his actions on thatevening. Perdomo, it has been discovered, was a Cuban exile whose stronganti-Castro leanings had led him into the employment of the CIA. Perdomo appearsto have been involved with U.S. intelligence from as early as 1961. Anothernoteworthy mention on his curriculum vitae is his active involvement in the Bayof Pigs fiasco led by rogue elements within the CIA. Whilst going under thealias ‘Joaquin Sanjenis’, Perdomo has been exposed as working with convictedWatergate burglar, CIA agent, Frank Sturgis. Sturgis trained anti-Castro Cubanexiles in preparation for the Bay of Pigs operation in 1961. Perdomo, it isclaimed, worked in conjunction with Sturgis for more than ten years, so could besaid to be a veteran of the darker side of CIA activity. Perdomo was the key witness to the shooting and reportedly was the first to sayto Chapman, “Do you know what you have just done? You have just shot JohnLennon!” If this is true the question arises, was this indeed a question or astatement implanting a memory? Chapman and Perdomo conversed off and onthroughout the time that they waited for Lennon to arrive home. According to thepolice reports, they talked mostly about the Bay of Pigs scandal and theassassination of JFK. Mark Chapman’s’ father was a sergeant in the United States Air Force at FortWorth, presumably at the nearby Carswell Air Force Base. He later worked for theAmerican Oil Company (known today as Amoco). This is perhaps unimportant butshows a vague family connection to the Military Industrial Complex. At his trial, Chapman was first examined by Psychiatrist Dr. Milton Kline, a manwho openly boasted about his ability to create hypnotically controlledassassins. Kline stated, “I can create a hypnotically driven patsy in threemonths, a mind controlled assassin in six”. Chapman was convicted as the soleconspirator in the death of John Lennon. John Hinckley, Jr., the failed killer of Ronald Reagan, has links andsimilarities to Mark Chapman. The attempted ‘lone nut’ assassination of RonaldReagan would have placed ex-director of the CIA and then vice-president GeorgeBush, Snr. into the top spot at the White House, a whole eight years sooner thanwas actually achieved. By pure coincidence I am sure, the Bush and Hinckleyfamilies are well connected old friends, both families having made enormousamounts of money in the Texas oil industry. In fact, George Bush's son, Neil,was supposed to have had dinner with Scott Hinckley, John Hinckley's brother,the evening that John went on his shooting rampage. One can only imagine theembarrassed conversation which would have occurred at that table. John Hinckley, Sr., a reputed CIA officer and close friend of George Bush, wasalso an important official in the same charitable organisation that took MarkChapman under its wing, World Vision. Like Mark David Chapman, John Hinckley,Jr. also had a copy of The Catcher in the Rye in his possession when he wasarrested. Hinckley had reportedly travelled extensively around America, again,showing similarities to Chapman. According to official reports, Hinckley was also heavily ‘influenced’ by thecharacter of Travis Bickle played by Robert DeNiro in the Martin Scorcese filmTaxi Driver. He has been reported to have become obsessed with Jodie Foster, theblonde haired, blue eyed, child actress who was given her start in the DisneyCorporation. Prior to his assassination attempt on Reagan, Hinckley was arrested at theNashville airport, Tennessee, as at the time he was concealing not one, butthree handguns in his possession. Strangely, Hinckley was not placed under anysurveillance by any law enforcement agencies after this incident. Also, in anemulation of the actions of Sirhan Sirhan, Hinckley kept a diary in which hedetailed his plans for shooting Reagan. It is known through court records thatHinckley underwent psychiatric treatment just prior to his attempt on Reagan andthat at the time of the shooting, he was under the influence of prescribedpsychiatric drugs. Found not guilty by reason of insanity, Hinckley remains confined to apsychiatric hospital where he has occasionally corresponded with such notablesas serial killer Ted Bundy and Lynette ‘Squeaky’ Fromme of Manson Family fame,who also failed in her attempted assassination of Nixon replacement, PresidentGerald Ford. Whilst it is clear that, in theory at least, these people could be under theinfluence of mind control, is it plausible to assume that those in power may usethese techniques to silence influential members of society? Certainly we haveseen numerous military assassinations of members of enemy forces that wereconsidered a threat to the current status quo."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEEN: SCHOOL SHOOTINGS The ferocity of the Virginia Tech massacre has led some to suggest thatperpetrator Cho Seung-Hui was perhaps under mind control. Charles Mesloh, who is the Professor of Criminology at Florida Gulf CoastUniversity, spoke to NBC 2 News. The Professor explained that he was puzzled bywhat he had seen. He was shocked to discover that the thirty two victims wereall killed by a single assailant who used handguns without any apparenttraining. The level of violence and destructive carnage had caused Mesloh toassume that either a high powered shotgun or an assault rifle had been used inthe attack. \"I'm dumbfounded by the number of people he managed to kill with these weapons,\"said Mesloh, \"The only thing I can figure is that he got close to them and hesimply executed them\". Mesloh said that in his opinion, the killer exhibited the expertise of a trainedprofessional, \"He had a 60% fatality rate with handguns - that's unheard ofgiven 9 millimetres don't kill people instantly\". Mesloh then stated that thehandguns the killer seemingly used were more suited for \"plinking at cans\", notexecuting large numbers of people quickly. The shooting spree lasted only nine minutes in total. In that short space oftime the apparent protagonist, student Cho Seung-Hui, managed to fire with aremarkable sense of accuracy, at least one hundred and seventy bullets. Usingboth hands to fire simultaneously, this is still a remarkable feat whenconsidering this is an untrained student in his early twenties. This correspondsto at least one shot fired every three seconds. Thirty two people were killedand twenty five were injured in the massacre. On certain websites Cho Seung-Hui can be seen in a photo wearing what appears tobe a U.S. Marines uniform; this image is available on the internet but wasremoved from the Wikipedia article concerning the shooting. In the image he isin a tent pictured with another soldier, both have balaclava face coverings butit is obviously Cho pictured. Does this mean that he was at some point in hislife militarily trained? That would account for the specialist levels ofshooting and the abnormally high kill rate, but goes against the narrativepainted in the mainstream media of a lone, computer game-obsessed student. Manywitnesses reported a broadly built gunman at least six foot in height. Thisdescription seems to be mismatched with the slightly built established suspectCho Seung-Hui. Initial reports of the event described two shooters.Criminologists at the scene initially assumed that there was more than oneshooter involved due to the pattern of killings and the sheer number of bulletsfired. Cho initially killed two people before returning to his dormitory room to recorda video confession which he later posted to NBC News. In the video he seemsdissociated and robotically drawls “when the time came I did it, I had to”. Muchof his speech is slurred and incoherent. “There are a hundred million chances and ways to avoid today but you chose tospill my blood. You forced me into a corner and gave me only one option, thedecision was yours, now you have blood on your hands that will never wash off.” He also sent eleven pictures of himself aiming a handgun at the camera, with alarge document expressing his all-encompassing hatred and resentment. Heexpresses a desire to get even, although never states who with. In part of thevideo he says, “I didn’t have to do this, I could have fled but no, I will nolonger run, it’s not for me, for my children, for my brothers and sisters thatyou fucked, I did it for them.” I am not suggesting that this is proof of abuse or a larger scheme; I am merelysuggesting this is another curious excerpt from a very strange case. Elements of Cho’s past indicate he had a tendency to dissociate and stories thathe wrote and submitted in his creative writing class often concerned abuse,paedophilia and traumatising events. “Lucinda Roy, a co-director of the creative writing program at Virginia Tech,taught Cho in a poetry class in fall of 2005 and later worked with himone-on-one after she became concerned about his behaviour and themes in hiswritings. Roy spoke outside her home Tuesday afternoon, saying that there was nothingexplicit in Cho’s writings, but that threats were there under the surface. Roy told ABC News that Cho seemed “extraordinarily lonely–the loneliest person Ihave ever met in my life.” She said he wore sunglasses indoors, with a cappulled low over his eyes. He whispered, took 20 seconds to answer questions, andtook cell phone pictures of her in class. Roy said she was concerned for hersafety when she met with him. One play attributed to him, called “Richard McBeef,” describes a 13-year-old boywho accuses his stepfather of paedophilia, and ends with the boy’s death. In another, called “Mr. Brownstone,” three high-school students face an abusiveteacher. “I wanna kill him,” says one character. “I wanna watch him bleed like the way he made us kids bleed,” saysanother.”[134] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn134] His older sister, Sun-Kyung, graduated from Princeton University in 2004. Asource, who asked to be identified as a senior administration official, reportedthat she works for McNeil Technologies, a firm contracted by the StateDepartment to manage reconstruction efforts in Iraq. In what may or may not beimportant, it has been revealed that McNeil provides support for intelligenceoperations inside and outside of the continental United States. This may be acoincidence, but this is yet another example of family members of suspected mindcontrol victims being connected to the intelligence agencies or the MilitaryIndustrial Complex. Researchers such as Propaganda Matrix’s Paul Joseph Watson point to the factthat the actions of the police allowed for a far greater loss of life andtherefore a more spectacular media event; “Police and EMT workers at Virginia Tech tell us that campus police were given afederal order to stand down and not pursue killer Cho Seung-Hui as Monday'sbloodshed unfolded. Though wishing to remain anonymous for obvious reasons, wehave received calls from police and EMT's who tell us that a stand down orderwas in place, and this is also confirmed by eyewitness Matt Kazee, who is astudent at VA Tech.” [135] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn135] The school police stood down for two hours, without notifying students orfaculty. The attacker was somehow able to leave campus and return. It has beenrumoured that fire doors were sealed preventing students from escaping. “Cho was certainly no slouch, in the two hour gap between the first reportedshootings and the wider rampage that would occur later in the morning, duringwhich time the University completely failed to warn the students despite havingloudspeakers stationed throughout the campus, Cho had time to film a confessionvideo, transfer it to his computer, burn it onto a DVD, package it up, travel tothe post office, post the package, and travel back to his dorm room to retrievehis guns and then travel back to the opposite end of the campus to resume thekilling spree. The almost inconceivable speed of Cho's actions become moresuspicious when we recall initial reports that there were two shooters.”[136][part0000_split_023.html#_edn136] Chris Matthews of MSNBC’s 'Hardball,' 18 Apr 2007, pointed out a discrepancywithin the narrative; Cho filed off the serial numbers on the gun. This is aseemingly sensible precaution for those wishing to leave minimal evidence,however, this action was contradicted by Cho using a credit card to buy the gunand keeping the receipt for the purchase. His videotaped confession alsohindered any potential future denials. Cho was found dead at the scene, meaninghe cannot shed any further light on the mysterious circumstances of themassacre. In an unusual turn of events, Cho decided to shoot himself squarely inthe back of his own head. His face was completely destroyed by the exit wound ofthe single, apparently self-inflicted, gunshot. If one were taken to symbology you could note that there were thirty three deadincluding Cho, thirty three being an important Masonic number, and the attacktook place in spring at Virginia, hence a sacrifice of spring virgins. Discrepancies within the evidence, as well as the very nature of the attacksthemselves, have led some to speculate that the tragedy at Columbine School waspossibly a mind control programme. This tends to fall into two camps, the firstbelieving the reported shooters Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris to be mindcontrolled like Manchurian Candidates, the second suggesting that others wereinvolved in the shooting, which was then presented to the public as the actionsof two crazed, confused teens. Some have even argued that the entire incidentcould have been arranged, to stoke up calls for tougher gun laws and tighterschool security. Another very plausible possibility that has been suggested isthat the monstrous incident was used as a distraction from the largest one daybombing campaign at that point, employed by the U.S. and aimed at targets in theKosovo War. The Columbine incident raises a number of questions. How were the FBI, ATF, CIAand NSA on the scene at Columbine literally within minutes of the beginning ofshootings? Some have reported large numbers of Police present before theshooting even began. During the siege no officers made any attempt to enter theschool. It is said that not a single shot was fired by a Law Enforcementofficial. These officials were allegedly ordered, by agents from the FBI andATF, who held operational authority, not to enter the building until after theshooting had stopped. Jefferson County's chief sheriff John Stone reiterated his long-held belief thatothers were certainly involved in the shooting rampage. The Rocky Mountain News quoted Chief Stone as telling Associated Press, \"I'venever thought it was just two because of the amount of stuff that was broughtin, but we don't have enough to charge anyone (else)\". The teens took two 20 lb (9 kg) propane bombs and placed them in duffel bags inthe cafeteria. Each bomb was set to explode at approximately 11:17 A.M.suspiciously; a school caretaker removed the security camera video tape andreplaced it at the exact same time the boys allegedly entered the cafeteria,meaning the act of placing the bombs was not recorded. Once the new tape beganthe bags could be clearly seen, leaving us to ‘assume’ that Klebold and Harrisplaced them there. A student eyewitness spoke of being shot at in the school's lower level duringthe first stages of the assault, contrary to the official narrative which hasthe shooters beginning the massacre at the west entrance of the school, itshighest point. Some students and faculty staff reported seeing three gunmen nottwo in the cafeteria area. Witnesses have also described this third gunman aswearing a mask. Students also reported seeing military hardware far more sophisticated than thehome made pipe bombs the teens created. \"Pipe bombs......what pipe bombs? We sawgrenades!” ABC News conducted an interview on the evening of 20 April 1999, with aColumbine High School student who escaped the massacre. The student made thefollowing statement, implicating another unnamed assailant who apparently threwgrenades from a position outside the school, during the shooting: \"Then we looked up, then one of the gunmen turned towards us and startedshooting, so we just fell down to the ground and we just sat there for a whileand we turned our heads and once we knew they were done shooting we stood backup and saw the kid in the white on the side of the school start throwing somekind of bomb on the top of the school. It was a grenade or some kind of bomb.\" A CNN article from the same day appears to corroborate the statements of thefirst student; \"Another male student, who said he was about 100 yards away from the shooters,said there were three of them, including one fellow student he recognized andanother boy dressed in white 'throwing the bombs on top of the school -- somekind of grenade or something'. That account was supported by another studentinterviewed on local TV.\" An Associated Press article written by Robert Weller on 20 April 1999, quotedstudent Jake Apoeaca: \"At first we thought it was fireworks, then we saw them shooting. He saw us andthen he started shooting at us. Then a guy in a white T-shirt threw two handgrenades on the roof.\" USA Today reported: \"Beyond the two dead gunmen, students described seeing another youth dressed ina white shirt throwing bombs that looked like soda cans. A youth matching thatdescription later was seen being led away by police.\" Three eyewitnesses who escaped the cafeteria spoke with Mark Koebrech of Channel9 News TV on the day of the incident; “We saw three guys withguns...*pause*...and then we saw a really tall guy in a black trench coat\". Thisseems to indicate further shooters still. Kim Sander, the mother of a student who had escaped during the massacre wasinterviewed on KUSA-TV. In the interview, aired on MSNBC, Kim stated that herdaughter saw one of the shooters and insisted that he was definitely not someonefrom her school: “Kim Sander: \"She looked up and saw a gunman in a black trench coat with a veryhuge gun in front of him.... He had dark brown hair, thick, bushy eyebrows andwas very ugly. She said he was a white male. ...\" News Anchor: \"Kim, did your daughter say if the gunman that she saw was astudent at the school?\" Kim Sander: \"She didn't recognize him as a student. No. Not as a student.\" On 22 April, Jefferson County District Attorney Dave Thomas stated publicly, \"I think there is some evidence to suggest that other people were at least awareof what was going on and, as the sheriff (John Stone) indicated earlier, thereare an awful lot of devices and this took a lot of time.\" This was reported in the Denver Rocky Mountain News, in a story entitled Thenagging questions: Did others help? The report went on to quote U.S. Attorney Tom Strickland as asserting: \"I think we have to pursue vigorously, at least for the time being, the ideathat there may have been other people involved at least in the planning andknowledge that this might occur. There were other people who are knowledgeableor seemed to be associated with this group of people. What we are a little bitunclear about is how all these devices got here and whether other peopleassisted them.\" Channel 9 News reported on 23 April that Colorado governor Bill Owens[http://web.archive.org/web/20000823162838/http:/www.9news.com/images/chs/owens.jpg]had visited the crime scene at Columbine High School. The report claimed thathe: \"Emerged saying investigators were all but certain that the two gunmen had helpfrom others. Police said security cameras may provide crucial evidence of aconspiracy. 'There are backpacks with bombs in there everywhere,' Gov. BillOwens said. 'The officers in there are convinced there had to be more peopleinvolved. There's just too much stuff in there.'\" Over one hundred bombs were found placed in various locations around the schooland reports show that at least twenty of these were heavy, propane tank-baseddevices, begging the question; how could the two students carry all the weaponryfound in the aftermath alone? Initial reports shown on CNN News claimed that the bombs found contained mercuryswitches, which are military-grade pieces of equipment. The same newscastclaimed FBI investigators had affirmed the devices were far too sophisticatedfor the teenagers to have constructed, implying that the true makers of thedevice had a background in military level explosives. Mysteriously, seventy two 9mm shell casings were discovered in areas of theschool that the two gunmen never entered during the massacre. The JeffersonCounty Sheriff's Office stated that in total, 853 ‘pieces’ of ballistic evidencewere recovered during the investigation. If 853 actual shots were fired, suchmight indicate the presence of other gunmen. TIME Magazine reported on 03 May1999, \"...the killers fired off an estimated 900 rounds”. Audio files of thepolice and dispatchers radio conversations recorded that day mention ‘largecalibre’ shots fired near the school. There were shell casings from a highcalibre weapon found on the roof of the school where witnesses reported seeing asniper. Police have denied anyone was present on the roof of the building. Teacher Patti Nielson and two female students reported being fired upon beforethe two boys officially entered the school. They described the gunman as a tall,lanky individual, wearing a black jumpsuit and carrying what has been describedas a 9mm machine pistol. Nielson was grazed by a bullet in her back as she andthe two students ran to hide in a chemistry lab. Of all the hundreds of pieces of evidence found, only two contained fingerprintsthat could be matched to Harris and Klebold. The left-handed Klebold apparentlyshot himself in the left temple, which would make sense except for the fact thatthe gun he was holding when he died was in his right hand. From a symbolic perspective, Columbine has connections to doves and the GoddessColumbia. In the mystery religions, doves have several symbolic meanings,including peace, war, and virginity and can represent the Goddess Columbia. TheFrench word for dove is ‘columbe’ and columbe is a Masonic word representativeof a sacrificial victim. A total of 13 students (doves) were sacrificed on 20 April 1999, Hitler’sbirthday and also the anniversary of the beginning of the U.S. mind controlproject BLUEBIRD. Eric Harris's father, a career Air Force Officer, was stationed at PlattsburgAir Force Base, in upstate New York, which has been alleged to be involved inmind control programmes connected to Ewen Cameron. This facility, whichofficially closed in 1994, still apparently emits some type of electromagneticsignal from an underground source, which indicates some continued activity atthe site. This is all highly speculative but it is safe to say there is far moreto this case than has been revealed to the public. Dylan Klebold was the son of Thomas Klebold, who, for reasons that have neverbeen explained, was filmed outside the school on the day of the shooting,wearing an FBI uniform and at times sitting in an official FBI vehicle. Footagefrom the day also showed high ranking military officials, including anunidentified U.S. army general and a colonel, outside during the shooting. Itwas also suggested by some that NATO forces were present at the scene, withgrainy footage from the day appearing to show SWAT teams with shields that bearthe moniker NATO. Reports have claimed that a van bearing the NATO emblem wasseen near the school on the day. If the claims or footage are to be believed asgenuine, it is certainly cause to wonder, as this matter had no call formilitary involvement. One connection between many ‘lone nuts’ has been pointed out by Paul JosephWatson of PrisonPlanet.com; “Investigators believe that Cho Seung Hui, the Virginia Tech murderer, had beentaking anti-depressant medication at some point before the shootings, accordingto The Chicago Tribune[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0704170925apr18,1,2244280.story].(In 2005 he was found to be stalking two female students and proclaimed “animminent danger to self or others” by a district court in Montgomery County, VA) Columbine shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, as well as 15-year-old KipKinkel, the Oregon killer who gunned down his parents and classmates, were allon psychotropic drugs.

The obvious answer is to providea horrifying spectacle for the public, to shock them into submission. This mayseem rather far fetched, unless of course you are aware of the tactics employedby agencies such as Tavistock."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEEN: SOFT KILL, SLOW KILL OR SILENT KILL ‘Psychotronics’ describes the use of external, manufactured devices obtain mindcontrol or achieve crowd control through what is ominously known in the industryas ‘less’ lethal methods. These devices are often referred to by industryinsiders as soft kill, slow kill or silent kill weapons. Psychotronic weaponry,as it is sometimes termed, can be an external apparatus working as atransmitter, ray gun or device implanted directly into the subject. In the 1960’s a memo was sent through the internal workings of the CIA,concerning the move away from drugging and hypnosis and towards the use ofelectronic means of coercion and manipulation. This would involveelectromagnetism, microwaves and ELF waves. Those involved with MK ULTRA werecertainly not averse to experimenting with these latest methods of coercion. “Subproject 62 documents “certain kinds of radio frequency energy have beenfound to effect reversible neurological changes in chimpanzees.” Subproject 54was studying how to produce concussions from a distance using mechanical blastwaves propagated through the air. The contractor says that such a concussion “isalways followed by amnesia for the actual moment of the accident.” He alsostates: “The blast duration would be in the order of a tenth of a second.Masking of a noise of this duration should not be difficult. It would beadvantageous to establish the effectiveness of both of the above methods as atool in brain-wash therapy…MKULTRA Subproject 119 was a literature review whichincluded a summary of existing information on “Techniques of activation of thehuman organism by remote electronic means.” According to a report in DefenceElectronics, consideration was given to using non-lethal weapons technology onDavid Koresh during the Branch Davidian siege in the spring of 1993…Research onthe ability of magnetic fields to facilitate the creation of false memories andaltered states of consciousness is apparently funded by the Defence IntelligenceAgency through the project cryptonym SLEEPING BEAUTY. “Sleeping Beauty was aDefence Department study of remote microwave min-influencing techniques.”[138][part0000_split_023.html#_edn138] In 1951 Dr. John Lilly published a scientific paper explaining how he could showthe patterns of the brain’s electrical activity. For this he would useelectrodes which he had designed for insertion into a living human. In 1953, hebegan a job studying neurophysiology[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurophysiology] with the U.S. Public HealthService Commissioned Officers Corps. He later worked for the National Institutefor Mental Health. Dr. Lilly designed and built the first isolation tank, asoundproof chamber in which the subject floats in warm salt water. Working inthe early 1950’s, Dr. John Lilly stated that through his experimentation he hadproven that electrical stimuli applied directly to specific areas of the braincould evoke either intensely rewarding or deeply cruel and punishing experiencesin humans. He summarized, “At any time an adult human being can be reduced to the childish level. Such astate can be induced by lack of sleep, by starvation, by torture, by isolation,by profound confinement, by drugs, by direct electrical stimulation. An adultcan be forced to learn by means almost thoroughly beyond his control. I amspeaking here of powerful means used ruthlessly with few scruples.” [139][part0000_split_023.html#_edn139] Dr. Lilly described the technique of electrode implantation which is achievablewithout the need for anaesthesia; “Electrodes could be implanted in the brain without using anaesthesia. Duringthe process of implantation, there was no more pain than that of a needle prickin the scalp. Short lengths of hypodermic needle tubing equal in length to thethickness of the skull were quickly pounded through the scalp into the skull.These stainless steel guides furnished passageways for the insertion ofelectrodes into the brain to any desired distance. Because of the small size ofthe sleeve guides, the scalp quickly recovered from the small hole made in it,and the sleeve guide remained imbedded in the bone for months to years. At anytime he desired, the investigator could palpate [rub] the scalp and find thelocation of each of the sleeve guides. Once one was found, he inserted a needledown through the bone. After withdrawing the needle, the investigator placed asmall sharp electrode in the track made by the needle and pressed the electrodethrough the skull and down into the substance of the brain to any desireddepth.”[140] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn140] In 1953, when John Lilly was asked by the director of the National Institute ofMental Health to brief the CIA, FBI and NSA on his work using electrodes tostimulate the pain and pleasure centers of the brain, he apparently refused. Dr.Lilly in his rebuttal of their offer, reminded the director of the NationalInstitute for Mental Health of an important dilemma: “Dr. Antoine Remond, using our techniques in Paris has demonstrated that thismethod of stimulation of the brain can be applied to the human without the helpof a neurosurgeon. This means that anyone with the proper apparatus can carrythis out on a person covertly, with no external signs that electrodes have beenused on that person. If this technique got into the hands of a security agency,they would have control over a human being and be able to change his beliefsextremely quickly, leaving little evidence of what they had done.”[141][part0000_split_023.html#_edn141] Despite Dr. Lilly’s apparent refusal to help any of the Intelligence agencies,the techniques were available and the ‘positive’ results published inexperimental papers. Whether or not the CIA used this particular application ornot is unclear, however the potential for covert control is obvious and it isunlikely that the agency merely ignored the possible application of thistechnique in the field. In the CIA’s interrogation manuals KUBARK and Human Resources Exploitation, JohnLilly’s isolation tanks are listed as being particularly useful tools forcreating stress and anxiety. Dr. Lilly was not the only one experimenting with this technique. In 1955, heexperimented on the application of electrical stimulation on the brains ofdolphins at Marineland amusement park, along with Dr. J. Roe, B. Mountcastle andL. Kurger of Johns Hopkins Medical School; Drs. C. Woolsey and J. Hind of theUniversity of Wisconsin; Dr. Karl Pribram from the Institute of Living, HartfordConnecticut and Dr. Leonard Malis of Mt. Sinai Hospital, New York City. During the experimentation the dolphins were also given intravenous doses of LSDdirect to the brain in order to test the response. The ultimate goal of theproject was to convert the animals into remote controlled marine suicidebombers. The dolphins would be equipped with high explosives and directedtowards the enemy, controlled by radio waves. As an aside, Roman Polanski was in London trying to develop a film, Day of theDolphin, based on the experiments of Lilly when his wife Sharon Tate wasexecuted by Charles Manson’s family members. The script was not entirelyaccurate as in Polanski’s version of events the dolphins could talk. MK ULTRA was also officially dipping its toes into the arena of control byelectrical means. The report on MK ULTRA Subproject 94, issued in October 1960,read: \"Initial biological work on techniques and brain locations essential toproviding conditioning and control of animals has been completed...Thefeasibility of remote control of activities in several species of animals hasbeen demonstrated. The present investigations are directed toward improvement oftechniques\"[142] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn142] A later report on Subproject 94, dated 22 November 1961, described the purpose: “Miniaturized stimulating electrode implants in specific brain centre areas willbe utilized. The feasibility of remote control of activities in several speciesof animals has been demonstrated. The present investigations are directed towardimprovement of techniques and will provide precise mapping of the useful braincentres. The ultimate objective of this research is to provide an understandingof the mechanisms involved in the directional control of animals and to providepractical systems suitable for (deleted) application.” The CIA research staff memorandum of 21 April 1961, for the deputy director ofthe agency, states the capabilities of the technology and the sinister directionin which the research was moving: \"At present time we feel that we are close to having debugged a prototype systemwhereby dogs can be guided along specific courses through land areas out ofsight and at some distance of the operator... In addition to its possiblepractical value in operations, this phenomenon is a very useful research tool inthe area of the behavioural sciences. Dr. {blanked out} is taking appropriateaction to exploit our knowledge of this area and provide adequate background forthe development of future Agency applications in the general areas ofInfluencing Human Behaviour, Indirect Assessment and Interrogation Aids\"[143][part0000_split_023.html#_edn143] Dolphins and dogs were not the only animals to go under the knife in the name ofcoercive technology. The CIA also spent a fortune in their attempts to equip apreviously normal house cat with microphones and remote control so that the poorthing could be used in real life scenarios for collecting information and otherespionage purposes. The cat was fitted with an apparatus that meant it could beremotely controlled by the handlers and directed as they wished; the remotesystem would override the cats normal biological responses meaning the CIA couldmaintain complete control. The project was heavily funded and work began in1961. Former CIA officer Victor Marchetti recounted the story of the AcousticKitty: “They slit the cat open, put batteries in him, wired him up. The tail was usedas an antenna. They made a monstrosity. They tested him and tested him. Theyfound he would walk off the job when he got hungry, so they put another wire into override that. Finally, they’re ready. They took it out to a park bench andsaid, “Listen to those two guys. Don’t listen to anything else – not the birds,no cat or dog – just those two guys!” After several major surgeries and months of intensive training, the cat wasready for its first real world field test. The CIA drove to a Wisconsin Avenuein Washington, D.C., and released the cat into the street from the rear of a vanin which they were parked. The cat ambled into the road and the CIA held itsbreath, the fruits of their Frankenstein-style labour finally coming tofruition. The cat responded to the remote influence, stepped into the road andwas struck by a taxi almost immediately. Five years of effort and over fifteenmillion dollars went under the wheels of an oncoming car. Many doctors across the globe were seemingly interested in the study ofelectrical manipulation of human beings. One of the most famous was Dr. JoséDelgado. José Delgado was a neurosurgeon and later a professor at theprestigious Yale University in America. Delgado performed the renownedbull/matador experiment where, by the use of remote control, he stopped acharging bull in its tracks, utilizing an electronic implant. This presentationwas made in 1965 and was reported worldwide, including in the New York Times, 17May 1965, who ran with the front page headline, “Matador’ With a Radio StopsWired Bull; Modified Behaviour in Animals Subject of Brain Study”. The implants,designed by Delgado, were called ‘stimoceivers’ and were able to achieve controlof the subject through the use of electrical stimulation directly into the brainin which they were set. Delgado spoke on many occasions concerning the conceptof robotizing humans. Delgado’s experimentation ran so far as to suggestcontrolling humans, to the extent that they were unaware that they had becomelike robots, was a feasible possibility. “With knowledge of the brain we may transform, we may shape, direct robotizeman. I think the great danger of the future is… that we will have robotizedhumans who are not aware that they have been robotized.”[144][part0000_split_023.html#_edn144] Delgado’s research into the implantation of devices to control the actions ofthe subject was financed by the U.S. Office of Naval Research. Delgado was born in Ronda [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronda], Spain[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain] in 1915 and received his Doctorate ofMedicine [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine] from the Universityof Madrid [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Madrid] just before theoutbreak of the Spanish Civil War[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War]. He served as a medicalcorpsman on the side of the Republican Army. After the war he had to repeat hismedical doctorate degree and took a Ph.D at the Cajal Institute[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajal_Institute] in Madrid[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid]. In 1946 he began a fellowship at Yale andin 1950 he was invited by the noted physiologist John Fulton[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Farquhar_Fulton&action=edit&redlink=1]to join the department of physiology. In 1974 Delgado returned to Spain to helporganize a new medical school at the Autonomous University of Madrid[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_University_of_Madrid]. In 1966 Delgado asserted that the results of his experiments showed that totalcontrol of an individual was achievable. He noted that his experiments; “Support the distasteful conclusion that motion, emotion and behaviour can bedirected by electrical forces and that humans can be controlled like robots bypush buttons.”[145] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn145] Delgado honed his manipulative craft on an island in Bermuda. He experimentedwith groups of gibbons to manoeuvre their social order through the electronicstimulation of the brain. His experimentation resulted in him altering thesocial orders of these groups, raising up certain individuals or alternativelydestroying whole swathes in order to test the efficiency of his implantations. In 1969 Dr. Delgado published the book Physical Control of the Mind, Toward aPsychocivilized Society, in which he stated, “It is already possible to induce a large variety of responses from motoreffects to emotional responses and intellectual manifestations by directelectrical stimulation of the brain.” “The individual is defenceless against direct manipulation of the brain becausehe is deprived of his most intimate mechanisms of biological reactivity.Electrical stimulation of appropriate intensity always prevails over free will.For example stimulation of the motor cortex will cause flexion of the hand thatcannot voluntarily be avoided; destruction of the frontal lobe produces changein effectiveness which are far beyond personal control.” \"Movements, sensations, emotions, desires, ideas, and a variety of psychologicalphenomena may be induced, inhibited, or modified by electrical stimulation ofspecific areas of the brain.” “Autonomic and somatic functions, individual and social behaviours, emotionaland mental reactions may be evoked, maintained, modified, or inhibited, both inanimals and in man, by electrical stimulation of specific cerebral structures.Physical control of many brain functions is a demonstrated fact. ... It is evenpossible to follow intentions, the development of thoughts, and visualexperiences.”[146] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn146] Delgado felt that free will and the agony of choice were bad for the individualand bad for society. He felt that psychologically, slaves were happier than freemen. This is the viewpoint of slave owners and not the oppressed. Although apopulous can be manipulated into believing their enslavement is the normal stateof affairs; no one given the choice would opt for slavery. It is true thatchoice causes psychological stress but there is a huge difference betweenwhether to choose the red or the green, an existential crisis on theresponsibility of decision, and having all free will removed. In 1965 Delgado was quoted in the New York Times: \"I do believe,\" he said in a recent lecture, “that an understanding of thebiological bases of social and antisocial behaviour and of mental activities,which for the first time in history can now be explored in a conscious brain,may be of decisive importance in the search for intelligent solutions to some ofour present anxieties, frustrations and conflicts.\" The article continued, “These have shown, he explained, that \"functions traditionally related to thepsyche, such as friendliness, pleasure or verbal expression, can be induced,modified and inhibited by direct electrical stimulation to the brain.\" “For example, he has been able to \"play\" monkeys and cats \"like littleelectronic toys\" that yawn, hide, fight, play, mate and go to sleep on command.” With such techniques, Dr. Delgado has shown: * Monkeys will learn to press a button that sends a stimulus to the brain of anenraged member of the colony and calms it down, indicating that animals can betaught to control other's behaviour. * A monkey, stimulated to extremely aggressive behaviour will make \"intelligent\"attacks only on competitive members of the colony, sparing other, friendlier,ones. * Monkeys and cats can be triggered into sequential behaviour in which one mightopen its mouth, turn around, walk to a corner, climb a wall, jump down andreturn to \"start,\" repeating those movements in the same order every time theyare stimulated but will modify the pattern if other animals get in the way or ifthey are threatened. The latter two experiments show that electrical brain stimulation does notsimply evoke automatic responses but reactions that become integrated into thesocial behaviour according to the individual's own personality or temperament,Dr. Delgado said.”[147] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn147] In 1967 the Department of Psychiatry at Yale University, in which Delgadoworked, published a report entitled Man’s Intervention in IntracerebralFunctions. The authors wrote: “Techniques are being developed for the investigation and manipulation of man.Two-way communication with the depth of the brain makes it possible to send andreceive information to and from the brain... We can start, stop or modify avariety of autonomic, somatic, behavioural, and mental manifestations. We canexperiment with intracerebral mechanisms responsible for the onset andmaintenance of specific behavioural and mental functions... As no batteries areused, the life of the transmitter is indefinite. Power and information aresupplied by radio frequencies.” In one particular experiment performed by Delgado he described, “A technicalinnovation in an eleven year old boy who had brain electrodes implanted fornon-therapeutic reasons”. Previously you had to have wires connecting thetransmitter directly to the skull. In this eleven year old boy however, JoséDelgado had figured out how to have a remote transmitter without a direct wireconnection. He described pushing a button in this otherwise normal eleven yearold boy’s brain transmitter and the boy immediately becoming confused about hisidentity, wondering whether he was a girl and talking about wanting to marryDelgado. He pushed another button and this behaviour stopped. “Electrical stimulation of the superior temporal convolution induced femininestriving and confusion about his own sexual identity. The patient, an11-year-old boy, said, ‘I was thinking whether I was a boy or a girl, which I’dlike to be,’ and ‘I’d like to be a girl.’”[148][part0000_split_023.html#_edn148] In a further example Delgado described; “Temporal-lobe stimulation produced in another patient open manifestations anddeclarations of pleasure, accompanied by giggles and joking with the therapist.In two adult female patients stimulation of the same region was followed bydiscussion of marriage and expression of a wish to marry the therapist.”[149][part0000_split_023.html#_edn149] Delgado’s stimocievers were further developed. They became effective overprogressively greater distances. Starting with direct wire attachments, movingthrough remote controlled radio waves (seen with the bull), to programmedstimulators which contained their own power source and then transdermalcommunicating stimocievers. Delgado developed a two way transdermal implant thatcould ‘talk’ to a computer system, recording brain function and physiologicalresponses. In 1975 Delgado wrote: “The most interesting aspect of the transdermal stimoceivers is the ability toperform simultaneous recording and stimulation of brain functions, therebypermitting the establishments of feedbacks and on demand programs of excitationwith the aid of the computer. With the increasing sophistication andminiaturisation of electronics, it may be possible to compress the necessarycircuitry for a small computer in a chip that is implantable subcutaneously. Inthis way, a new self-contained instrument could be devised, capable ofreceiving, analysing, and sending back information to the brain, establishingartificial links between unrelated cerebral areas, functional feedbacks andprograms of stimulation contingent on the appearance of predetermined patterns.” Later Delgado experimented with the use of electromagnetic waves to controlimplants at far greater distances. In an interview in 1975, Delgado stated thatelectromagnetic broadcasting for mind control had been developed to a state ofeffectiveness and could be utilized at up to three kilometres. Delgado made no bones about his elitist ideals: “This new knowledge is so important that I think it should radically change thephilosophy of our educational system, which believes in the sanctity ofindividuals, thinking that an individual exists at birth. This belief is nottrue and this science is going to prove the fallacy of democracy in the sensethat we talk about the rights of the individual this democratic belief is nottrue. Because we are forming this individual, because we are constructing hisbrain, we are willy nilly making the differences we either desire or dislike.” In 1985 Kathleen McAuliffe visited him in his laboratory in Spain to research anarticle for the magazine OMNI. He also experimented with radio waves directed atchicken embryos. These waves caused controlled developmental changes in theirgrowth, including halting the development of hearts and veins. The experimentwas replicated by the American Navy with the same results being produced.[150][part0000_split_023.html#_edn150] Delgado testified before Congress in 1974 to champion his research. This istaken from the actual 1974 Congressional Testimony of Dr. José Delgado; \"We need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society. Thepurpose is physical control of the mind. Everyone who deviates from the givennorm can be surgically mutilated.” \"The individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence,but this is only his personal point of view. This lacks historical perspective.” \"Man does not have the right to develop his own mind. This kind of liberalorientation has great appeal. We must electrically control the brain. Somedayarmies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain.\"[151] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn151] An article from Popular Science dated 09 September 2010 discussed thepossibility of utilising Delgado’s ideas: “Working under a DARPA grant, a researcher at Arizona State is developingtranscranial pulsed ultrasound[http://science.dodlive.mil/2010/09/01/remote-control-of-brain-activity-using-ultrasound/]technology that could be implanted in troops’ battle helmets, allowing soldiersto manipulate brain functions to boost alertness, relieve stress, or even reducethe effects of traumatic brain injury. Manipulating the brain to enhance warfighting capabilities and maintain mentalacuity on the battlefield has long been a topic of interest for DARPA andvarious military research labs, but the technology to do so remains limited. Deep brain stimulation (DBS), for instance, requires surgically implantedelectrodes to stimulate neural tissues, while less-invasive methods liketranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) possess limited reach and low spatialresolution. But Dr. William J. Tyler, an assistant professor of life sciences at ASU, writeson the DOD’s “Armed With Science[http://science.dodlive.mil/2010/09/01/remote-control-of-brain-activity-using-ultrasound/]”blog: “To overcome the above limitations, my laboratory has engineered a noveltechnology which implements transcranial pulsed ultrasound to remotely anddirectly stimulate brain circuits without requiring surgery. Further, we have shown this ultrasonic neuromodulation approach confers aspatial resolution approximately five times greater than TMS and can exert itseffects upon subcortical brain circuits deep within the brain.” Tyler’s technology, packaged in a warfighter’s helmet, would allow soldiers toflip a switch to stimulate different regions of their brains, helping themrelieve battle stress when it’s time to get some rest, or to boost alertnessduring long periods without sleep. Grunts could even relieve pain from injuries or wounds without resorting topharmaceutical drugs. More importantly, in the periods after brain trauma ultrasound technology couldreduce swelling and metabolic damage that is often the root cause of lastingbrain damage.”[152] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn152] Brain electrode research was also conducted independently at Harvard byDelgado’s co-authors, Drs. Vernon Mark, Frank Ervin and William Sweet. Mark andErvin described implanting brain electrodes in a large number of patients atHarvard hospitals. A patient named Jennie was only 14 years old when they putelectrodes in her brain. In Mark and Ervin’s publication Violence and the Brain,photographs show another patient, 18-year old Julia, smiling, angry, or poundingfuriously on the wall depending on which button is being pushed on thetransmitter box sending signals to her brain electrodes. “Robert G. Heath, of Tulane University, achieved great notoriety by implanting125 electrodes in his subjects, in an attempt to ‘cure’ homosexuality with ESB(electronic stimulation of the brain). He discovered that he could control hispatients by inducing fear, arousal, hallucination, and pleasure.”[153][part0000_split_023.html#_edn153] Dr. Heath, Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Neurology at TulaneUniversity, placed brain electrodes in a young homosexual man and fitted himwith an electrical box. A button on the box could be used to stimulate anelectrode implanted in the septal region of his brain. This region is a pleasurecentre. During one three-our period, the patient, referred to as B-19,stimulated himself 1,500 times.“During these sessions, B-19 stimulated himself to a point that he wasexperiencing an almost overwhelming euphoria and elation, and had to bedisconnected, despite his vigorous protests.”[154][part0000_split_023.html#_edn154] Robert Heath also conducted experiments that used LSD as a further tool ofmanipulation; \"Dr. Robert Heath of Tulane University, as early as 1955, working for the Army,gave patients-LSD while he had electrodes implanted deep inside theirbrains.”[155] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn155] In 1956 James Olds conducted similar experiments, implanting electrodes into thepleasure centers of rats’ brains. The rats eventually starved themselves todeath due to their fixation on self-stimulation (a stark warning for teenageboys everywhere!). Dr. Andrija Puharich designed and built an implantable chip that would fit intothe subjects tooth. The design of this radio tooth implant was quickly bought bythe CIA. Speaking in 1987, Dr. Puharich revealed, “We were able to develop a hearing device that fit under the cap of the toothand we could hear very clearly from a small little relay and receiver andtransmitter and unfortunately it was promptly classified by an agency of ourgovernment. But we did solve the problem in terms of hardware.” As an aside, actress Lucille Ball claimed to be able to pick up radio signalswith her teeth following some dental work performed in 1942. She reported, “One night I came into the Valley over Coldwater Canyon, and I heard music. Ireached down to turn the radio off, and it wasn’t on. The music kept gettinglouder and louder, and I realized it wasn’t coming from my mouth. I evenrecognized the tune. My mouth was humming and thumping with the drumbeat, and Ithought I was losing my mind. I thought, “What the hell is this?” Then itstarted to subside. I got home and went to bed, not sure if I should tellanybody what had happened because they would think I was crazy.” She didn’t hear anything through her teeth again for another five days. Notuntil the night she decided to take a different route home. “All of a sudden, my mouth started jumping. It wasn’t music this time, it wasMorse code. It started softly, and then de-de-de-de-de-de. As soon as it startedfading, I stopped the car and started backing up until it was coming in fullstrength. DE-DE-DE-DE-DE-DE DE-DE-DE-DE! I tell you, I got the hell out of therereal quick. The next day I told the MGM Security Office about it, and theycalled the FBI or something, and sure enough, they found an underground Japaneseradio station. It was somebody’s gardener, but sure enough, they were spies.” The truthfulness of this story is debated, although clearly the plot is at leastplausible. The potential applications of these technologies are frightening. Conceivablythey could be employed for crowd control, to instruct soldiers telepathically orto convince a subject that they were going mad. A particularly frighteningaspect of the technology is the fact that the use of these devices could becompletely hidden from the victim. Perhaps the most shocking aspect is that someof these devices, which have been proven to work effectively, are over fiftyyears old."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEEN: SYNTHETIC TELEPATHY Dr. Michael Persinger, a cognitive neuroscientist, experimented in remotelyprojecting emotional states into people’s minds. He caused them to feel fear orrage using electromagnetic waves. In this manner he was able to demonstrate theartificially induced changes in brain function. These would cause irreversiblestates of white hot rage or catatonic terror in the subject by mimicking thenatural processes of the brain that invoked these responses. He also included inhis arsenal of techniques, synthetic telepathy, namely making the subject hearvoices that would instruct them into action. Michael Persinger was born in Jacksonville[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida], Florida[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida] and grew up primarily in Virginia[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia], Maryland[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland] and Wisconsin[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin]. His father was a chief petty officerin the Navy attached to an atomic bomb delivery squadron. He attended CarrollCollege [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_College_(Wisconsin)] and latergraduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison] in 1967.He then obtained an M.A. in physiological psychology[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiological_psychology] from the University ofTennessee [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tennessee] and a Ph.D fromthe University of Manitoba [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Manitoba]in 1971. He has worked at Laurentian University[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurentian_University], located in Sudbury,Ontario, since 1971. A 1975 issue of Modern People magazine included this admission; “When a part of your brain receives a tiny electrical impulse from outsidesources, such as vision, hearing etc., an emotion is produced- anger at thesight of a gang of boys beating an old woman, for example. The same emotions ofanger can be created by artificial radio signals sent to your brain by acontroller. You could instantly feel the same white hot anger with no apparentreason.”[156] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn156] The signals fired at the subject in Persinger’s experiments recreate the naturalprocesses of the brain in a response to normal stimuli. In 1995 Dr. Persinger published an article with the incredibly catchy title, Onthe Possibility of Directly Accessing Every Human Brain by ElectromagneticInduction of Fundamental Algorithms. It discussed the results of his recentexperiment in which he exposed students to 5 Hz electromagnetic fields. Theresults produced in the students included the reduction of perspiration, drymouths, stomach pains and increased relaxation of the test subjects. Accordingto unconfirmed reports, Persinger was employed on the U.S. Army project‘Sleeping Beauty’, which studied and tested the potential battlefieldapplication of mind-altering electromagnetic weapons. “Under the Reagan administration’s top secret Project Sleeping Beauty, Dr.Michael Persinger, chief neurologist at Laurentian University’s EnvironmentalPhysiology Laboratory in Ontario, was \"quietly\" funded to find the answers.Using what are called time-varying fields of low intensity in the extraordinarylow frequency range from one to ten hertz, Persinger was consistently able tomake a cage of rats sick. The ELF field he generated had stimulated the MASThistamine-producing brain cells into inducing instant nausea.”[157][part0000_split_023.html#_edn157] In his article Michael Persinger describes the ways in which the individualdifferences among human brains can be overcome, in order to successfully affecta broad enough target. The following conclusion was drawn: \"Within the last two decades... a potential has emerged which was improbable butwhich is now marginally feasible. This potential is the technical capability toinfluence directly the major portion of the approximately six billion brains ofthe human species without mediation through classical sensory modalities bygenerating neural information within a physical medium within which all membersof the species are immersed. The historical emergence of such possibilities...resulted in major changes in the social evolution that occurred inordinatelyquickly after the implementation. Reduction of the risk of the inappropriateapplication of these technologies requires the continued and open discussion oftheir realistic feasibility and implications within the scientific and publicdomain.\" Persinger also made and demonstrated on many occasions, his perception alteringdevice, the God Helmet. This was a converted motorcycle/skidoo helmet that whenworn would induce powerful aural and visual hallucinations, making the subjectfeel as though their reality was changing. They would be convinced they were acompletely different person and could be induced into vivid fantasies in whichthey could meet and interact with projected entities. Subjects could be made tobelieve they had interacted with other people, met angels, demons or even God.It could induce profound religious experiences and even the belief of beingabducted by aliens. As reported in the Sydney Morning Herald; \"Scientists are trying to recreate alien abductions in the laboratory... Theexperiment, to be run by Professor Michael Persinger, a neuroscientist atLaurentian University, of Sudbury, Ontario, consists of a converted motorcyclehelmet with solenoids on its sides that set up magnetic fields across asubject’s head.\"[158] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn158] The God Helmet contained a device nicknamed the Octopus that used electricalcomponents called solenoids, which create ‘weak but complex’ magnetic fields.The Octopus uses these solenoids around the whole brain, in a circle just abovesubject's ears, eyes and at the back of the skull. This allows for the magneticfield to pass directly into the subject’s temporal lobes. A 1993 report in the publication Defense News disclosed that for over 20 yearsDr. Persinger, \"...has been working on a theory that connects not only UFOs and earthquakes,but also powerful electromagnetic fields and an explanation of paranormalbeliefs in terms of unusual brain activity. He has also found that stimulatinganother area, the temporal lobes, can produce all sorts of mystical experiences,out-of-body sensations and other apparently paranormal phenomena.\"[159][part0000_split_023.html#_edn159] That same year journalist Ian Cotton tried the God Helmet and described thehallucinations; “I was actually in a line of solemn Tibetan Monks, grave eyed, brown cowlsaround their heads. I too was a Tibetan monk and what I realized is I had alwaysbeen one.” One woman who wore the helmet believed that her dead mother had physicallymaterialized beside her. In a separate test, a female subject experienced apresence so powerful and compassionate that she burst into fits of tears when itvanished. Psychologist Susan Blackmore, writing in New Scientist, said she feltsomething; \"Get hold of my leg and pull it, distort it, and drag it up the wall... Totallyout of the blue, but intensely and vividly, I suddenly felt anger... Later, itwas replaced by an equally sudden attack of fear.\" Over a thousand volunteers have worn the helmet and 80% of them, Persingerconfirmed, experienced a \"sensed presence - the feeling that someone's standingnear you, the feelings there must be something greater, the feeling of infinitepossibilities\". Persinger stated; “Ultimately human experience is determined by what is happening in the brain andthe experience of god can be generated by a process that has nothing to do withwhether god exists or not.” The Ultrascience television show titled Weapons of War and shown on America’sLearning Channel in 1997, showed the work of Dr. Michael Persinger. It discussedhis work and demonstrated Persinger precisely directing very specific, magneticsignals into the brain of a volunteer student in an experiment. The showexplained that Dr. Persinger specialized in relaxation and pain therapies. Later, another student reported pleasant feelings of well-being as Dr. Persingerbeamed ‘an opiate firing pattern’ of weak magnetic signals, using electric coilson either side of her head. Dr. Persinger said it would be unethical to causefeelings of fear and anxiety but clearly this could be done. \"Mind control wouldbe the ultimate non lethal weapon\" the narrator stated."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEEN: WEAPONS OF THE MIND In 1961, Dr. Allen Frey wrote the paper; Auditory System Response to RadioFrequency Energy in which he explained; \"Our data to date indicate that the human auditory system can respond toelectromagnetic energy in at least a portion of the radio frequency (RF)spectrum. Further, this response is instantaneous and occurs at low powerdensities, densities which are well below that necessary for biological damage.For example, the effect has been induced with power densities 1/60 of thestandard maximum safe level for continuous exposure.\"[160][part0000_split_023.html#_edn160] Allan H. Frey was born in 1935 and worked at General Electric[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric]'s Advanced Electronics Center atCornell University [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University], U.S.A. Asa renowned neuroscientist [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscientist], heresearched and publicised the nature of the microwave auditory effect[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_auditory_effect], or the ‘Frey Effect[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frey_effect]' as it is known. Frey admitted in1975, via a study published and printed for the New York Academy of Sciences[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annals_of_the_New_York_Academy_of_Sciences], thatmicrowaves [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwaves] \"with certain modulations[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulations]” could “cause leakage in theblood-brain barrier [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood-brain_barrier]”, theconsequences of which could be fatal. The microwave auditory effect, also known as the microwave hearing effect or theFrey Effect, consists of audible clicks induced by microwave[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave] frequencies. The clicks are generateddirectly inside the human head without the need of any receiving electronicdevice. The effect was first reported by persons working in the vicinity ofpowerful radar [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar] transponders during WorldWar II [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II]. These induced sounds are notaudible to other people standing nearby but only to those directly in the pathof the waves. It was later discovered that the microwave auditory effect couldbe induced with shorter-wavelength portions of the electromagnetic spectrum[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum]. In 1962 Dr. Frey published in the Journal of Applied Physiology the results ofhis experiments, using the transmission of sounds into the brain byelectromagnetic radiation at a distance of up to 1000 feet. The‘electromagnetic’ sounds were also, amazingly, heard by totally deaf testsubjects. The radiofrequency sound was \"described as being buzz, clicking, hissor knocking, depending on several transmitter parameters, i.e. pulse width andpulse repetition rate\".[161] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn161] In his report, Frey noted the differing effects that can be produced; \"With somewhat different transmission parameters we can induce the perception ofsevere buffeting of the head\" and \"changing ... parameters again, one can inducea \"pins-and-needles\" sensation\". Another, more advanced experiment with the transmission of radiofrequency soundsinto the brain was published in American Psychologist magazine in 1975. Don R.Justesen spoke, in the article on “Microwaves and Behavior”, about the result ofan experiment described to him over the telephone by his colleague J. C. Sharp.Joseph C. Sharp was employed on the project Pandora by the American Navy. Thiswas officially designed to research the radiofrequency radiation directedtowards the American Embassy in Moscow from the 60s until the beginning of the80s. At the Walter Reed Army Institute, Sharp improved the Allan Frey method tothe point where he transmitted understandable words into his own brain.[162][part0000_split_023.html#_edn162] According to the Scientists for Global Responsibility magazine: \"Drs Alan Frey and Joseph Sharp conducted related research. Sharp himself tookpart in these experiments and reported that he heard and understood wordstransmitted in pulse-microwave analogs of the speaker’s sound vibrations.Commenting on these studies, Dr. Robert Becker, twice nominated for the NobelPeace Prize, observed that such a device has obvious applications in covertoperations designed to drive a target crazy with voices, or deliver undetectableinstructions to a potential assassin.\"[163] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn163] At various times the U.S. government has discussed using the ‘Frey Effect’ todisrupt large scale disturbances such as riots or anti-establishment protests. Dr. Andrija Puharich, inventor of the tooth implant, also experimented with ELFwaves beamed directly at people. He discovered that certain wavelengths resonatewith specific resulting effects on the subject. Our brains are extremelyvulnerable to any technology which sends out ELF waves, because they immediatelystart resonating to the outside signal by a kind of tuning-fork effect. Puharichdiscovered 7.83 Hz (the earth's pulse rate) made a person feel good, producingan altered-state, 10.80 Hz causes riotous behaviour and 6.6 Hz causesdepression. Dr. Igor Smirnov, a psychiatrist from the Moscow Academy of Medicine, is oftencalled the father of psychotronic weaponry. He could implant emotions inpeople’s minds using a technique he described as ‘psycho acoustic correction’.He stated, “I can always allow for the possibility that perpetrators can and infact do use such methods to manipulate ones conscious for the purpose ofcreating terrorists”. In 1993 and 1994, American magazines Defense Electronics, Newsweek and VillageVoice published the information that the U.S. secret services and FBI hadrequested that Dr. Smirnov demonstrated for them his device, which was capableof subliminally implanting thoughts in people’s minds and enabled him to controltheir actions. A participant in the meetings with Dr. Smirnov in the U.S.A. (wishing to remainanonymous) was quoted in the article in the Defense Electronics as saying; \"The intelligence agencies... had been tracking Smirnov for years..., we knowthere is evidence the Soviet Army's Special Forces used the technology duringthe conflict in Afghanistan.\" Smirnov’s patent was later purchased by Psi Tech, the CIA run, remote-viewingorganization led by Ingo Swann and Col. John, B. Alexander. A German TV documentary, shown in 1998 and titled Secret Russia: Moscow: TheZombies of the Red Czar, discussed Dr. Igor Smirnov and his psycho-acousticcorrection technology. The programme described how Smirnov used his equipment tobeam messages directly into the patient's head for therapeutic purposes. Thedocumentary also included interviews of victims claiming to have been subjectsin illegal Russian government experiments for testing classified mind control or'psychotronic' weapons. In 1993 Smirnov rose to brief fame in the United States when the FBI consultedwith him in hope of ending the standoff at the Branch Davidian compound in Wacowith ‘cult’ leader David Koresh. Smirnov proposed blasting scrambled sound overloudspeakers, containing subliminal instructions in order to persuade Koresh tosurrender. When officials asked what would happen if the subliminal signalsdidn't work, Smirnov casually replied that Koresh's followers might conceivablyslit each other's throats. The FBI was put off by Smirnov's off-hand response totheir questions and decided against this tactic, so Smirnov returned to Moscowwith his mind control technology. Rather than allow for the possibility ofsuicide, the inhabitants were shot and burnt to death instead by the ATF(Department of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The compound at Mount Carmel wasblasted with loud rock, metal and pop music, distorted Tibetan chants,industrial noise and the sounds of rabbits being slaughtered. This acousticbombardment tactic was used to cause confusion, disorientation and sleepdeprivation, but was not apparently connected to Smirnov’s technology. An article published in Newsweek, August 1994, discussed Smirnov’s proposedsolution; \"Pipe subliminal messages from sect member's families through the telephonelines into the compound. For David Koresh the group's leader... the FBI had inmind a special voice: God as played by the venerable actor Charlton Heston\"[164][part0000_split_023.html#_edn164] Additional publications have reiterated this; \"The FBI, in 1994, studied the possibility of the use of non lethal technologyagainst David Koresh. FBI then informed Russians about technology that enablesthem to transmit to Koresh subconscious signals. In this way the FBI wanted toassume the role of the voice of God.\"[165] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn165] In reaction to such articles publicising Russian military secrets, the Russiannewspaper Pravda released on 06 March 1994: \"Village Voice printed \"scandalousnews\" that Russians are capable to control human behaviour.\"[166][part0000_split_023.html#_edn166] When a journalist from the Moscow News asked Igor Smirnov whether he could makepeople vote for a certain candidate in the elections he replied, \"In principleit can be done. And it is not difficult. But not interesting\". About hisparticipation in Waco he stated, \"I suggested that voices of children andfamilies inviting the suicidal people back home could be mixed with the noise ofpolice car engines\". The FBI then did not proceed with his proposition when heguaranteed only 70% chance of success. According to Rusalkina, Smirnov’s wife, the Soviet military enlisted Smirnov'spsychotechnology during the Soviet Union's war in Afghanistan in the 1980’s; \"Itwas used for combating the Mujahedeen and also for treating post-traumaticstress syndrome\" (in Russian soldiers). The idea of psychotronic weapons enjoys some respectability in Russia. In thelate 1990’s, Vladimir Lopatin, then a member of the Duma, Russia's parliament,pushed to restrict mind control weapons, a move that was taken seriously inRussia but was met with a mixture of scorn and amusement in the few areas it wascovered in the Western press. In an interview in Moscow, Lopatin, who has sinceleft the Duma, cited Smirnov's work as proof that such weaponry was real andeffective. At the 1978 SALT peace talks, Russian President Brezhnev suggestedbanning weapons “more frightful than the mind of man has ever conceived”. In Guantanamo Bay, detainees are repeatedly blasted with sound and flashinglights. It has been reported in many mainstream media outlets that prisoners areblasted with such diverse acts as heavy metal band Metallica, pop group Matchbox20 and even the theme tune from the children’s show Barney the Dinosaur. In 2012it was revealed that the theme tune from Sesame Street was also used in asimilar manner. The songs would be played on a continuous loop for up to 24hours at a time. Whether or not these songs contained subliminal messages isdebatable. The technique of continuous sound battery can serve to simply overstimulate the detainee which also serves as a method of depriving other sensesand causing disorientation. The use of the Barney the Dinosaur theme as atorture device was repeated by the U.S. media several times, usually in acomedic sense. It has been suggested that the exposure of the use of themes fromchildren’s television shows as a torture device served to reduce all other talesof atrocities coming from rendition sites to a joke. Other detainees spoke ofloud, continuous industrial thuds, crashing metal; gas valve noises and thesounds of heavy machinery were mixed in with synthesisers during theirinternment. In the December 1980 edition of the U.S. Army Journal, the Military Review, acolumn by Lt. Col. John B. Alexander, entitled 'The New Mental Battlefield: BeamMe Up, Spock' provides further insight into the possible technical capabilitiesavailable; \"Several examples will demonstrate areas in which progress have been made. Thetransference of energy from one organism to another; the ability to heal orcause disease to be transmitted over a distance, thus inducing illness or deathfrom no apparent cause; telepathic behaviour modification which includes theability to induce hypnotic states up to a distance of 1,000 kilometres have beenreported. The use of telepathic hypnosis also holds great potential. This capability couldallow agents to be deeply planted with no conscious knowledge of theirprogramming. In movie terms, the Manchurian Candidate lives, and does not evenrequire a telephone call. 'Other mind-to-mind induction techniques are beingconsidered. If perfected this capability could allow the direct transference ofthought via telepathy from one mind or group of minds to a select targetaudience. The unique factor is that the recipient will not be aware that thoughthas been implanted from an external source. He or she will believe the thoughtsare original.\" Alexander's article continued: \"If it is possible to feed artificial thought into the multigenic field viasatellite, the mind control of the entire planet is now possible. Anindividual's only resistance would be to constantly question the motivationbehind their thoughts and not act upon thoughts which they consider to beoutside their own ideological, religious and moral boundaries.” The article also includes the statement, “there are weapons systems that operateon the power of the mind and whose lethal capacity has already beendemonstrated”. The concept and application of synthetic telepathy has been discussed in othermilitary publications, namely US Air Force, New World Vistas: Air and SpacePower for the 21st Century; \"It would also appear to be possible to create high fidelity speech in the humanbody, raising the possibility of covert suggestion and psychological direction.When a high power microwave pulse in the gigahertz range strikes the human body,a very small temperature perturbation occurs. This is associated with a suddenexpansion of the slightly heated tissue. This expansion is fast enough toproduce an acoustic wave. If a pulse stream is used, it should be possible tocreate an internal acoustic field in the 5–15 kilohertz range, which is audible.Thus, it may be possible to ’talk’ to selected adversaries in a fashion thatwould be most disturbing to them.”[167] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn167] The use of technology to induce mass mind control was contemplated as far backas 1969, by a former science adviser to President Johnson. Gordon J. F.Macdonald, a geophysicist specializing in problems of warfare, noted that; “Accurately timed, artificially excited strokes ’could lead to a pattern ofoscillations that produce relatively high power levels over certain regions ofthe earth... In this way, one could develop a system that would seriously impairthe brain performance of very large populations in selected regions over anextended period...\" This was presented in Zbigniew Brzezinski’s Between Two Ages: America’s Role inthe Technetronic Era. In 1998, an article was written by Lt. Col. Timothy L. Thomas, describing thepsychotronic capabilities then available for use by the U.S. military. Thearticle, entitled The Mind Has No Firewall, first appeared in the militarymagazine Parameters and was published in the spring of 1998. The article beginswith an explanation of the manner in which the human systems can be hijacked bythe use of these technologies; “The human body, much like a computer, contains myriad data processors. Theyinclude, but are not limited to, the chemical-electrical activity of the brain,heart, and peripheral nervous system, the signals sent from the cortex region ofthe brain to other parts of our body, the tiny hair cells in the inner ear thatprocess auditory signals, and the light-sensitive retina and cornea of the eyethat process visual activity. We are on the threshold of an era in which thesedata processors of the human body may be manipulated or debilitated.” The article makes clear the fact that at the time of writing, these avenues ofmanipulation were already available to those in the know; “An entirely new arsenal of weapons, based on devices designed to introducesubliminal messages or to alter the body's psychological and data-processingcapabilities, might be used to incapacitate individuals. These weapons aim tocontrol or alter the psyche, or to attack the various sensory anddata-processing systems of the human organism. In both cases, the goal is toconfuse or destroy the signals that normally keep the body in equilibrium.” In the article Thomas refers to the work previously undertaken by the Sovietscientist, Dr. Victor Solntsev of the Baumann Technical Institute in Moscow.Solntsev believed the human body to be an \"open system\". This means that thehuman body communicates with its external environmental factors and willinteract with electromagnetic, gravitational and acoustic forces. If thistechnology allows for alteration in the levels of these interactive effects, the\"psycho-physiological equilibrium\" of the individual can be changed, causing amarked loss in efficiency. This is achieved by the exploitation of what Thomas terms \"informational noise\";the messages, images or other items of information transferred to the subject ofthe attack. This ‘noise’ interferes with the reasoning and analytical capacityof the subject by preventing their normal reaction to external stimulus,rendering that individual incapacitated. “These technological applications can have many uses. Acoustic weapons, forexample, could be adapted for use as acoustic rifles or as acoustic fields that,once established, might protect facilities, assist in hostage rescues, controlriots, or clear paths for convoys. These waves, which can penetrate buildings,offer a host of opportunities for military and law enforcement officials.Microwave weapons, by stimulating the peripheral nervous system, can heat up thebody, induce epileptic-like seizures, or cause cardiac arrest. Low-frequencyradiation affects the electrical activity of the brain and can cause flu-likesymptoms and nausea. Other projects sought to induce or prevent sleep, or toaffect the signal from the motor cortex portion of the brain, overridingvoluntary muscle movements. The latter are referred to as pulse wave weapons,and the Russian government has reportedly bought over 100,000 copies of the\"Black Widow\" version of them.” Michael Aquino is the highest ranking military officer in the National SecurityAgency and also the leader of the Temple Of Set, an offshoot from the Church ofSatan. In his paper From PSY-OP to Mindwar, he talks about killing anonymouslyat a distance with ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. In the paper, the enemyis described as anyone who opposes U.S.A. foreign policy, including its owncitizens. “Strategic MindWar must begin the moment war is considered to be inevitable,\"the document stated. \"It must seek out the attention of the enemy nation throughevery available medium, and it must strike at the nation's potential soldiersbefore they put on their uniforms. It is in their homes and their communitiesthat they are most vulnerable to MindWar. MindWar must be strategic in emphasis, with tactical applications playing areinforcing, supplementary role. In its strategic context, MindWar must reachout to friends, enemies, and neutrals alike across the globe—neither throughprimitive 'battlefield' leaflets and loudspeakers of PSYOP nor through the weak,imprecise, and narrow effort of psychotronics—but through the media possessed bythe United States which have the capabilities to reach virtually all people onthe face of the Earth. These media are, of course the electronicmedia—television and radio. MindWar must target all participants to be effective. It must not only weakenthe enemy; it must strengthen the United States. It strengthens the UnitedStates by denying enemy propaganda access to our people, and by explaining andemphasizing to our people the rationale for our national interest in a specificwar.\" The document concluded by emphasizing that MindWar should employ subliminalbrainwashing technologies and weapons that directly attack the targetedpopulation's central nervous system and brain functioning; “The theory behind brainwashing was that physical torture and deprivation wouldweaken the mind’s resistance to suggestion, and this was true to a point. But inthe long run brainwashing does not work, because intelligent minds later realizetheir suggestibility under such circumstances and therefore discount impressionsand options inculcated accordingly. For the mind to believe in its own decisions, it must feel that it made thosedecisions without coercion. Coercive measures used by the operative,consequently must not be detectable by ordinary means. Ionization of the air: An abundance of negative condensation nuclei (“air ions”)in ingested air enhances alertness and exhilaration, while an excess of positiveions enhances drowsiness and depression. Extremely low frequency waves …ELF waves are not normally noticed by the unaidedsenses, yet their resonant effect upon the human body has been connected to bothphysiological disorders and emotional distortion. Infrasound vibration (up to 20Hz) can subliminally influence brain activity to align itself to delta, theta,alpha or beta wave patterns, inclining an audience toward everything fromalertness to passivity. Infrasound could be used tactically, as ELF-waves endurefor great distances: and it could be used in conjunction with media broadcastsas well. There are some purely natural conditions under which minds may become more orless receptive to ideas, and MindWar should take full advantage of suchphenomena as atmospheric electromagnetic activity, air ionization, and extremelylow frequency waves.\" Inducing death by an unseen external device is not a new concept. Russianscientist Dr. V.P. Kaznacheyev believed that he had demonstrated that deathcould be caused by beaming ultraviolet rays from a distance, as shown in thescientific paper, Apparent Information Transfer Between Two Groups of Cells,Psychoenergetic System, Vol.1, December 1974, and Distant IntercellularInteractions in a System of Two Issue Cultures, Psychoenergetic System, Vol. 1,no. 3, March 1976. Robert Pavlita, a Czech engineer, showed he could kill insects at a distance byusing psychotronic devices. Soviet scientists were reportedly able to kill goatsat ranges beyond one kilometre.[168] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn168] A 1976 U.S. State Department report, Microwave US-USSR, Vol VI, July-Dec. 1976,Office of Security, US Dept. of State, suggested it was possible to induce aheart attack in a person, from a distance, with radar waves. This certainlyraises questions over the deaths of particular politicians, researchers andwhistle blowers over the years. The previously mentioned Aquino was also involved, but acquitted of any criminalact, in the alleged Presidio child abuse ‘case/cover up’. In this allegedincident, several children caught sexually transmitted diseases and hadconfirmed sexual injuries. They were able to give accurate descriptions of‘Mikey’ and ‘Shamby’ (Col. Michael Aquino and his wife Lillith) and their home,in which they claimed they were photographed and filmed in various states ofundress and whilst enacting satanic rituals. It is interesting to note that in declassified CIA documents it shows that thetraumatizing of children is a key foundation to splitting personality andcreating multipersonality. Psychiatrist and mind control researcher Colin Ross has noted that, “Thedeliberate creation of multiple personality in children is an explicitly statedplan in the MKULTRA Subproject Proposal submitted for funding on May 30,1961”.[169] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn169] At the day-care centre in the Presidio military base, many children spoke ofsatanic and sexual abuse at the hands of their carers. There were five confirmedcases of chlamydia amongst the young children who made these claims. ReporterLinda Goldston investigated the Presidio site and discovered areas that weredesignated and decorated for satanic ritual on the base. This included altersfor ritual practices, candles, pentagrams, satanic artwork such as ‘666’, etc.There were also a number of large paintings of the devil. Throughout the world there are dozens of people who claim to be under electronicor microwave attack. Amongst the number is journalist Alex Constantine. Theseattacks can include sleep deprivation, headaches or radiotronic attacks, whichproduce unbearable heat. They can also cause people to be driven mad withbuzzing or high pitched squeals. Electronic and microwave weaponry are sadly far from science fiction. As earlyas 1953, the Russian intelligence agencies began attacking the U.S. Embassy inMoscow using microwave weaponry. Many staff who worked at the embassy sufferedfrom symptoms of radiation poisoning; nausea, exhaustion, bleeding eyes, etc.U.S. Ambassador Mac Stroesell developed and quickly died from lymphoma. Thiscould have been coincidental, but as the staff were purposefully kept in thedark about the testing as the U.S.A. correlated their own results, this isunlikely. The data was later taken back to the U.S.A. and the analysis was continued byDr. Ross Adey, who also worked on the electric dissolution of memory withextremely low frequency radiowaves and microwaves. The Pandora Project, as itwas termed, found that the microwave radiation interferes with a person’sdecision-making capacity and causes chronic stress and low efficiency. Monkeysexposed to microwave radiation in experiments showed a marked decrease in theirability to perform simple tasks. The white blood count of the U.S. Embassyworkers was 40% higher than normal, indicating infection, physical stress andpossible early symptoms of leukaemia or bone marrow disease. In April 1976, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger sent the following telegram tothe U.S. Embassy in Moscow: “Beginning in 1960, the Soviet Union directed high frequency beams of radiationat the US Embassy in Moscow which were calculated not to pick up intelligence,but cause physiological effects on personnel. It has been verified that theeffects are not temporary. Definitely tied to such electromagnetic waves are:(A) Cataracts, (B) Heart attacks, (C) Malignancies, (D) Circulatory problems,and (E) Permanent deterioration of the nervous system. In most cases, theafter-effects do not become evident until long after exposure – a decade ormore.” Officially the Soviets did not admit that they were microwaving the Americans,however, the bombardment of the Moscow Embassy continued. It began in 1953 andin 1975 the signals changed, indicating that either the Russians had modifiedtheir technique or were experimenting with new applications. Two newtransmitters were added by the Soviets in later years, showing that funding forthese experiments did not decrease. Dr. Ross Adey's studies at the Brain Research Institute of the University ofCalifornia were funded directly by the CIA. In their Pandora project theymanaged to collect an entire catalogue of the different brain signals produced.These indicated specific actions, emotions and pathological states of mind. Itwas discovered that when microwaves were used to fire these specific signals atvictims' brains, they began to experience the moods, behaviour or pathologicalstates carried by the signals, with no means of controlling their own actions.This meant that by mimicking natural brain frequencies, the human brain could becontrolled remotely using extremely low frequency broadcast carried by microwavebeams. A BBC documentary, called Opening Pandora's Box and produced by David Jones forFulcrum Central Productions in 1984, showed Ross Adey with the Russian ‘Lida’machine. This was developed in Soviet Armenia in the 1940’s. This device wasreportedly used to beam radiofrequencies, combined with sound and lightdisplays, at Soviet psychiatric patients. The device acted like a sleep ray,causing the sedation of the patient without physical contact. Dr. Adey testedthe device on animals and it \"produced marked relaxation\". The BBC narratorstated that there were reported accounts where the Lida was used to brainwashAmerican prisoners of war during the Korean War. Dr. Ross Adey examined the Lida machine at the Loma Linda Veterans Hospital,where it was described as a machine to \"rearrange consciousness\". The Russiansclaimed to have used it for treatment of emotional disorders during the 1950’s.The Lida machine used coiled wire inside ear muffs, which acted like an antennaand emitted pulses of electro magnetic radiation, each lasting one tenth of asecond. Dr. Adey demonstrated that excited animals rapidly quietened down whenexposed to the specific frequencies. Adey stated that the Lida machine was nowobsolete, which begs questions about what technology replaced it. For these devices to be effective they would require a specific frequency toinvoke the necessary effect. Catalogues of these frequencies are reportedlyavailable to the general public from Russian neuro-medical research institutes. A very quick internet search for psychotronics will guide you to equipment suchas voice to skull directed acoustic devices. These are neuro-electromagneticnon-lethal weapons which have the ability to produce mood-altering sounds in aperson's head. You will also find Remote Neural Monitoring (RNM), which usessatellite-transmitted extra low frequencies (ELF) to send voice to braincommunications. Mood alteration and the induction to action via voices in thehead is an admitted reality. The field of Augmented Cognition includes Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation(TMS) and this technique is used therapeutically by the military. This works byemitting electrical impulses directly into the brain in order to affect mood,sleep patterns and improve cognitive abilities in areas of learning, memory,attentiveness, visualization and decision-making. The long-term neurologicaleffects are unknown in such devices but it is acknowledged that the potentialfor human harm is quite considerable. A discussion on the application of these techniques was written about in theU.K. Independent newspaper in 2011. The article concerned the use of drugs andtechnology to improve a soldier’s capability. In a far more sinister applicationof the technology, it is said to remove memories of actions that may causepost-traumatic stress disorder. The technology is presented as a medicalpreventative method but the possibilities are frightening. “Combat is immensely stressful and although proper training means that men andwomen can remain focused while in mortal danger, it is afterwards that problemsbegin. During the Vietnam War, one in three soldiers was treated forpost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and in the Second World War a significantproportion of Allied conscripts never fired a shot in anger because of stressand fear before the battle had even begun. Up to now, PTSD has been treated by amix of psychotherapy and antidepressants – effective techniques but expensiveand time-consuming. But as with fatigue there may be a chemical shortcut forPTSD. The trick is to erase unwanted memories, or at least take away their sting.Professor Roger Pitman, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School in the US, hasbeen experimenting with a drug called propranolol, a \"beta blocker\" normallyused to treat high blood pressure, which he believes can erase the effects ofterrifying memories. Professor Pitman has given the drug to young volunteers who have sufferedextreme trauma in, for example, road accidents. Those given placebos sufferednightmares, and remained fearful of the road. When exposed to recordingsdescribing their accidents they suffered typical stress responses – sweating,beating heart, dilated pupils. But those who had been on a course of propranololshowed no response at all. It was as though the trauma had not happened. For asoldier, memory-altering drugs such as this could mean violent combat becomingno more troubling, retrospectively, than a visit to the gym. \"The problem is,\"Professor Moreno says, \"what else are they blocking when they do this? Do wewant a generation of veterans who return without guilt?\" Generals not only want stronger, more alert and less stressed soldiers; theywant smarter ones, too. One of the most bizarre neuroscience findings in recentyears is that by immersing the human brain in a powerful magnetic field, itspowers of reasoning and learning are almost magically enhanced. No one knows exactly how \"transcranial magnetic stimulation\" (TMS) works, butthe Australian neuroscientist Professor Allan Snyder believes that magneticfields in some way \"switch off\" the higher levels of mental processing thatnormally cloud our thoughts, allowing a \"pure\" form of reasoning to take over. \"Each of us could draw like a professional, do lightning-fast arithmetic,\" hesays. In fact, some subjects in TMS experiments have acquired (temporarily)similar abilities to the rare \"autistic savants\", people who are able to performastounding arithmetical feats and memorise whole telephone directories (anautistic savant was played by Dustin Hoffman in the film Rain Man). In 2009, a US Academy of Sciences report concluded that within 20 years we couldbe using TMS to enhance soldiers' fighting capabilities. As Professor Morenosays, \"there is talk of TMS machines being used on the battlefields within 10years in vehicles and in 10 years more in helmets.\" Why? Being a soldier demandsa high level of technical expertise. It is no longer just a case of pointing agun and shooting. Even combat rifles are now \"systems\" and mastering battlefieldelectronics requires a lot of training. It may seem clear that if you could create a man with no scruples, who feelslittle pain and no fear, you would have an excellent fighting machine, but thismay be a case of be careful what you wish for. We get scared for a reason – toavoid danger to ourselves and others. Fatigue may force us to rest beforesustaining damaging injury. Even post-traumatic stress disorder may have abeneficial role. Moral scruples help soldiers to act as an effective team – inbattle, troops will always say they are fighting for their mates before Queenand country. Take away the humanity of the soldiers and there is a danger that the battlesand wars we fight will become inhuman as well. Most of all there is, surely, adanger that these techniques, far from producing better soldiers, will actuallyproduce a squad of zoned-out zombies, who will be no match for the determined,driven and highly motivated zealots of the Taliban.”[170][part0000_split_023.html#_edn170] The greatest public celebration of the power of psychotronics seemingly wasshown during the closing stages of the first Gulf War. The evidence suggeststhat it was the technology employed by the Allied troops that literallyconvinced the Iraqi Army to surrender. The 23 March 1991 news brief, High-Tech Psychological Warfare Arrives in theMiddle East, described a U.S. Psychological Operations (PsyOps) tactic directedagainst Iraqi troops in Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm. The manoeuvreconsisted of a system in which subliminal, mind-altering technology was carriedon standard radiofrequency broadcasts. The 26 March 1991 news brief stated that among the standard military logisticsgroups in the centre of U.S. war planning operations at Riyadh was “anunbelievable and highly classified PsyOps program utilising ’silent sound’techniques”. This method was employed when the Iraqi army’s command and control system wasdestroyed by heavy bombardment. The Iraqi troops were then forced to usecommercial FM radio stations in order to communicate orders and tactics. TheU.S. PsyOps team reportedly set up its own portable FM transmitter, utilisingthe same frequency, in the deserted city of Al Khafji. This U.S. transmittercompletely overpowered the local Iraqi station. Along with patriotic andreligious music, the U.S. PsyOps team transmitted “vague, confusing andcontradictory military orders and information”. Also employed was the S-Quad Silent Sound technology. This used both synthetictelepathy to ‘speak’ directly to the Iraqi troops and the use of subliminal moodalteration, inducing the Iraqis into irreversible states of anxiety, fear andhopelessness. “They were surrendering in droves, almost too fast for us to keep up with…twoIraqi majors, both brigade commanders, who gave up their entire units…” and“…one of them gave up to an RPV [remotely piloted vehicle). Here's this guy withhis hands up, turning in a circle to give himself up to a model airplane with acamera in it.\" Although completely silent to the human ear, the negative voice messages placedon the tapes alongside the audible programming by PsyOps psychologists wereseemingly clearly perceived by the subconscious minds of the Iraqi soldiers. Thesilent messages completely demoralised the deeply imbedded soldiers andinstilled a perpetual feeling of terror and impending doom in their minds.Reports showed that the Iraqi armed forces were safe and equipped, with enoughsupplies and entertainment to keep them comfortably contained for at least sixmonths. The mind-altering mechanism is based on a subliminal mood-altering technologynamed the Silent Sound Spread Spectrum (SSSS), sometimes called ‘S-Quad’ or‘Squad’. The technology was developed by Dr. Oliver Lowery of Norcross, Georgiaand is described in US Patent #5,159,703, \"Silent Subliminal PresentationSystem\", dated 27 October 1992. The abstract for the patent reads: \"A silent communications system in which nonaural carriers, in the very low orvery high audio-frequency range or in the adjacent ultrasonic frequency spectrumare amplitude- or frequency-modulated with the desired intelligence andpropagated acoustically or vibrationally, for inducement into the brain,typically through the use of loudspeakers, earphones, or piezoelectrictransducers. The modulated carriers may be transmitted directly in real time ormay be conveniently recorded and stored on mechanical, magnetic, or opticalmedia for delayed or repeated transmission to the listener.\" Silent Sounds, Inc., the company that proudly manufactured the equipment neededto induce such responses, stated that it was interested only in positiveemotions, but the military was obviously not so limited. Edward Tilton, formerpresident of Silent Sounds, Inc. discussed S-Quad in a letter dated 13 December1996: \"All schematics, however, have been classified by the US Government and we arenot allowed to reveal the exact details... ... we make tapes and CDs for theGerman Government, even the former Soviet Union countries! All with thepermission of the US State Department, of course... The system was usedthroughout Operation Desert Storm (Iraq) quite successfully.\" These claims were also repeated on the Silent Sounds, Inc. website, whichcuriously was deleted and all references removed in 1997, when Silent Soundsapparently went out of business. This is potentially another case of a personrevealing far too many details of clandestine technologies and being effectivelysilenced. Judy Wall stated in her article, Mind control with silent sounds and supercomputers, Resonance, the Newsletter of the Bioelectromagnetics; “By using these computer-enhanced EEGs, scientists can identify and isolate thebrain's low-amplitude \"emotion signature clusters\", synthesise them and storethem on another computer. In other words, by studying the subtle characteristicbrainwave patterns that occur when a subject experiences a particular emotion,scientists have been able to identify the concomitant brainwave pattern and cannow duplicate it. \"These clusters are then placed on the Silent Sound carrierfrequencies and will silently trigger the occurrence of the same basic emotionin another human being!\" [171] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn171] It is also rumoured that microwaves were used against the protestors at GreenhamCommon. At specific times, usually during the movement of missiles to and fromthe site, ‘textbook’ symptoms of radiation sickness were reported. Peoplecomplaining of burns, headaches, nausea, panic and terror with no obvious cause.A large number of protestors reported circulation problems. Some protestersdeveloped aggressive cancers and later died. Electronics Today magazine carried out a number of measurements and in December1985 published their report which concluded: “Readings taken with a wide range of signal strength meters showed markedincreases in the background signal level near one of the women’s camps at a timewhen they claimed to be experiencing ill effects.” They noted that if the women created noise or a disturbance near the fence, thesignals rose sharply. Tim Rifat is a well known investigator of the use of psychotronics in Europe. Heclaims that MI5 are using ELF waves in Brighton to make vagrants andundesirables feel physically sick so they will be forced to vacate the area theywere in. He states: “An example was Brighton police van, parked outside the Brighton Pavilion whichwas used to beam UHF and microwaves at vagrants to clear them from the area. AllBrighton's city centres are bombarded with microwaves when vagrants congregateto make them so ill they have to flee. The Evening Argus newspaper asked thepolice if the white van which was parked in the Brighton Pavilion grounds formonths, was their van, they replied it was one of their 'surveillance' vehicles.On Wednesday, 4th of February the author was passing Brighton Police stationwith a frequency counter which detects microwave weapons, and I detected a 452MHz microwave beam being directed at two young offenders sitting on a wallopposite the station. I confronted the police with the reading, Robert Galloway,spokesperson for the police stated, \"They were not interested in microwaves evenif they were a danger to health.\" The author has uncovered widespread use ofmicrowave weapons in Brighton by the police and MI5 as a test programme to clearvagrants from the city centre. On the Channel 4 programme, For the Love of…New World Order, shown on Mondaynight at 12pm, on April 6th, the author revealed some of these facts ontelevision. The presenter and researchers of this programme complained of severeheadaches in the days preceding filming symptomatic of microwave attack.” In August 2010, the U.S. weapons manufacturer Raytheon[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raytheon] announced that it had partnered with ajail in Castaic, California [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castaic,_California]in order to use prisoners as test subjects for a new, non-lethal weapon systemthat \"fires an invisible heat beam capable of causing unbearable pain\".[172][part0000_split_023.html#_edn172] Reporter Lisa Zyga also discovered evidence of further experimentation by thePentagon concerning the use of voices beamed into people’s heads. “A recently unclassified report from the Pentagon from 1998 has revealed aninvestigation into using laser beams for a few intriguing potential methods ofnon-lethal torture. Some of the applications the report investigated includeputting voices in people's heads, using lasers to trigger uncontrolled neuronfiring, and slowly heating the human body to a point of feverish confusion - allfrom hundreds of meters away. A US citizen requested access to the document, entitled \"Bioeffects of SelectedNon-Lethal Weapons,\" under the Freedom of Information Act a little over a yearago. There is no evidence that any of the technologies[http://www.physorg.com/news122567894.html] mentioned in the 10-year-old reporthave been developed since the time it was written. The report explained several types of non-lethal laser applications, includingmicrowave hearing, disrupted neural control, and microwave heating. For thefirst type, short pulses of RF energy (2450 MHz) can generate a pressure wave insolids and liquids. When exposed to pulsed RF energy, humans experience theimmediate sensation of \"microwave hearing\" - sounds that may include buzzing,ticking, hissing, or knocking that originate within the head. Studies with guinea pigs and cats suggest that the mechanism responsible for thephenomenon is thermoelastic expansion. Exposure to the RF pulses doesn’t causeany permanent effects, as all effects cease almost immediately after exposureceases. As the report explains, tuning microwave hearing could enablecommunicating with individuals from a distance of up to several hundred meters. \"The phenomenon is tunable in that the characteristic sounds and intensities ofthose sounds depend on the characteristics of the RF energy as delivered,\" thereport explains. \"Because the frequency of the sound heard is dependent on thepulse characteristics of the RF energy, it seems possible that this technologycould be developed to the point where words could be transmitted to be heardlike the spoken word, except that it could only be heard within a person’s head.In one experiment, communication of the words from one to ten using ´speechmodulated´ microwave energy was successfully demonstrated. Microphones next tothe person experiencing the voice could not pick up these sounds. Additionaldevelopment of this would open up a wide range of possibilities.\" The report predicts that communicating at longer distances would be possiblewith larger equipment, while shorter range signals could be generated withportable equipment. Putting voices in people’s heads could cause what the reportcalls \"psychologically devastating\" effects. The technology might even allow forcommunicating with an individual hostage surrounded by captors, although thiswould require \"extreme directional specificity.\" With another weapon, electromagnetic pulses could be used to disrupt the brain’sfunctioning, although this technology was still in the theoretical stages at thetime. Under normal conditions, all brain structures function with specific rhythmicactivity depending on incoming sensory information. Sometimes, the brainsynchronizes neuronal activity in order to focus on a specific task, but thedegree of neuronal synchronization is highly controlled. However, under certainconditions (such as physical stress or heat stroke), more areas of the brain canfire in a highly synchronized manner, and may begin firing uncontrollably. The report describes a method for replicating this highly synchronized neuronfiring across distances of several hundred meters. High-voltage (100 kV/m)electromagnetic pulses lasting for one nanosecond could trigger neurons to fire,disrupting the body’s controlled firing activity. Short-term effects may includeloss of consciousness, muscle spasms, muscle weakness, and seizures lasting fora couple minutes. These high-voltage pulsed sources, which would require anestimated frequency of 15 Hz, exist today. Another form of non-lethal torture described in the report is microwave heating.By raising the temperature of the body to 41°C (105.8°F), humans can experiencesensations such as memory loss and disorientation, and exhibit reducedaggression. According to the report, humans can survive temperatures up to 42°C(107.6°F), at which time prolonged exposure can result in permanent brain damageor death. The microwave heating technique was tested on a Rhesus monkey, where a 225 MHzbeam caused an increase in the animal’s body temperature. Depending on thedosage level, the temperature increase occurred within a time of 15 to 30minutes. After the beam was removed, the animal’s body temperature decreasedback to normal. The report suggests the technique could be useful forcontrolling crowds or in negotiations.”[173] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn173] In 1995, the U.S. Department of Defence put forward the contract, Communicatingvia the Microwave Auditory Effect; Awarding Agency: Department of Defence; SBIRContract Number: F41624-95-C-9007. The description of this technology, whichwould be used for direct communications with military personnel, is written asfollows: \"Title: Communicating via the Microwave Auditory Effect \"Description: An innovative and revolutionary technology is described thatoffers a means of low-probability-of-intercept Radio Frequency (RF)communications. The feasibility of the concept has been established using both alow intensity laboratory system and a high power RF transmitter. Numerousmilitary applications exist in areas of search and rescue, security and specialoperations.[174] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn174] This technology would allow less scrupulous individuals to beam fear-inducingvoices into unsuspecting heads, which is clearly linked to the work of AllanFrey. New Scientist magazine reported in 1998, “A recently declassified US Army report on the biological effects of non-lethalweapons reveals outlandish plans for \"ray gun\" devices, which would causeartificial fevers or beam voices into people's heads. The report titled \"Bioeffects Of Selected Nonlethal Weapons\" was released underthe US Freedom of Information Act. The DoD has confirmed to New Scientist thatit released the documents, which detail five different \"maturing non-lethaltechnologies\" using microwaves, lasers and sound. Some of the technologies are conceptual, such as an electromagnetic pulse thatcauses a seizure like those experienced by people with epilepsy. Other ideas,like a microwave gun to \"beam\" words directly into people's ears, have beentested. It is claimed that the so-called \"Frey Effect\" - using close-rangemicrowaves to produce audible sounds in a person's ears - has been used toproject the spoken numbers 1 to 10 across a lab to volunteers.” There are a number of potential uses for these techniques and they couldtheoretically be used in a number of scenarios. However, the most effective useof these devices appears to lie in the arena of harassment and covert coercion."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTEEN: GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED TERROR During its foray into Vietnam, the U.S. developed a scenario designed todestabalise the populous through a sustained campaign of horrific violencecommitted against civilians. The scheme was brilliant in its sadisticimplementation. Rather than attacking the leaders of the enemy, the U.S. wouldattack the supporters and sympathisers of the cause with incredible violence, toshock them into submission. Those who can see a possible connection with thesetactics and those employed by the agents of Tavistock, are not alone.The Phoenix Program was ostensibly designed to identify the Viet CongInfrastructure supporting the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong] (NLF). The plan was to neutralise itsmembers through the means of capture, coercion or killing.Phoenix Program operations were carried out by several U.S. led organisations.These included the South Vietnam’s National Police, National Police Field Force,Special Police Branch and U.S. and Vietnamese conventional armed forces. U.S.Army Intelligence Phoenix advisors were trained at the Fort Bragg Institute forMilitary Assistance and assigned at various stations throughout Vietnam. By1972, Phoenix operatives had neutralised 81,740 suspected NLF supporters, ofwhom at least 26,369 were killed.William Colby [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Colby], the CIA director inthe latter part of the 1970’s, stated when interviewed;\"In the years since the 1975, I have heard several references to NorthVietnamese and South Vietnamese communists, who state that in their mind themost, the toughest period that they faced in the whole period of the war from1960 to 1975 was the period from 1968 to '72 when the Phoenix Program was atwork.\"[175] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn175] William Egan Colby was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul,_Minnesota] on 04 January 1920. Heserved with the Office of Strategic Services[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services] during World War II[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II] and joined the recently formedCentral Intelligence Agency[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency] after the war’s end.Colby held the positions of Chief of Station in Saigon[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigon], Chief of the CIA's Far East Division andhead of the Civil Operations and Rural Development effort, as well as overseeingthe Phoenix Program [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Program], during andprior to the Vietnam War. After the Vietnam War and upon his return to theU.S.A., Colby was appointed the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, apost he held from September 1973 to January 1976.Lieutenant [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant] Vincent Okamoto[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Okamoto], who was an intelligence-liaisonofficer for the Phoenix Program for two months in 1968, made the followingstatement;“The problem was, how do you find the people on the blacklist[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacklist]? It's not like you had their addressand telephone number. The normal procedure would be to go into a village andjust grab someone and say, 'Where's Nguyen so-and-so?' Half the time the peoplewere so afraid they would not say anything. Then a Phoenix team would take theinformant [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant], put a sandbag over his head,poke out two holes so he could see, put commo wire[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commo_wire] around his neck like a long leash, andwalk him through the village and say, 'When we go by Nguyen's house scratch yourhead.' Then that night Phoenix would come back, knock on the door, and say,'April Fool [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day], motherfucker[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherfucker].' Whoever answered the door wouldget wasted. As far as they were concerned whoever answered was a Communist,including family members. Sometimes they'd come back to camp with ears to provethat they killed people.”[176] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn176]Okamoto stated;\"If Phoenix goes in and murders someone who was not Viet Cong, and they abusethe mother and the sister, well anybody in the family who survives is going tobe a card-carrying Viet Cong by the next afternoon.\"[177][part0000_split_023.html#_edn177]This is actually an ideal scenario, if your intention is to terrify a populousinto coercive submission. The random indiscriminate nature of killing wouldtraumatise the civilian population into petrified compliance or malleableshellshock.Military Intelligence Officer K. Milton Osborne stated that he witnessed thefollowing uses of torture:\"The use of the insertion of the 6-inch dowel into the canal of one of mydetainee's ears, and the tapping through the brain until dead. The starvation todeath (in a cage), of a Vietnamese woman who was suspected of being part of thelocal political education cadre in one of the local villages ... The use ofelectronic gear such as sealed telephones attached to ... both the women'svaginas and men's testicles [to] shock them into submission.\"[178][part0000_split_023.html#_edn178]Dr. Alan Levin was interviewed in 1993 about his involvement with Phoenix.“So, I volunteered for this Operation Phoenix[http://www.whale.to/b/phoenix1.html], which was a psychological operation. Tomake a long story short, it would make Charlie Manson look like Abigail VanBuren. It was basically a psychological operation, and it was very well done.Americans have done it many times before and in essence we did it inadvertentlyin Libya. The theory is you don't kill the leader; you kill his children, or hisfamily.Basically, what you do is you destroy the chief's family very ignominiously, andI mean ignominiously. I mean, Charlie Manson would look like a \"sweetie\"compared to what this stuff was. And so when the guy comes back, he sees thismess -- you know his wife beheaded, and her infant child stripped out of herabdomen, and beheaded and bleeding on her body, hung from a rafter, shit allover the walls, those kinds of things -- that's how you do it. And when thathappens, then these guys lose confidence in themselves, and the village losesconfidence in them, but they're not martyrs. So the whole operation loses itsfighting will. And that's basically \"The American Way\".” [179][part0000_split_023.html#_edn179]Another method rumoured to be favoured by the CIA was to arrive at a village orsettlement shortly after the men had left. The women and children would berounded up, raped, brutalised and beheaded and a large picnic table would be setin the centre of the village, complete with tablecloth, cutlery and plates. Thebodies of the villagers would be arranged sitting at the table with theirsevered heads placed on the plates, facing their bleeding torsos. The CIA wouldleave no trace of their presence, apart from the grisly tableau that greeted themen on their return.On 25 August 1970, an article appeared in The New York Times hinting that theCIA, through Phoenix, was responsible for the My Lai massacre.The My Lai massacre refers to the mass execution on 16 March 1968, of up to 504unarmed civilians in the hamlets of Mỹ Lai[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Lai,_Vietnam] and My Khe[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=My_Khe&action=edit&redlink=1] of SơnMỹ [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_Tinh] village, South Vietnam[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam]. This massacre was carried out byUnited States army [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army] soldiers,specifically by a division known as ‘Charlie Company’. The majority of thevictims were those less able to defend themselves; children, infants, women andthe elderly. Most of the women, irrelevant of age, were raped prior to theirexecution and many of the bodies found had been mutilated before and afterdeath.Three U.S. servicemen reportedly attempted to stop the massacre and defend thewounded civilians. They were initially vilified by the U.S. media and severalU.S. Congressmen publicly denounced them as traitors, in an attempt to concealthe details of the massacre from the public. The three servicemen were inundatedwith hate mail and death threats and found the corpses of mutilated animals lefton their doorsteps several times.The original story published in the New York Times developed on 14 October 1970,when defence attorneys for David Mitchell, a sergeant accused and later clearedof machine-gunning scores of Vietnamese in a drainage ditch in My Lai, citedPhoenix as the CIA’s “systematic program of assassination” . Mitchell named EvanParker as the CIA officer who “signed documents, certain blacklists” whichdictated which Vietnamese civilians were to be assassinated in My Lai. Parker,when confronted, denied the charge.Attorney George Davis travelled to Da Nang in 1970 to investigate the massacreand while there, was assigned a Vietnamese colonel as an aide, who insisted thatthe massacre was a Phoenix operation. The colonel was in no doubt that that thepurpose of the Phoenix operation was “to terrorize the civilian population intosubmission”.U.S. soldier Bart Osborn was far more specific in his understanding of the truepurpose of the Phoenix Program: “I never knew in the course of all thoseoperations any detainee to live through his interrogation”.Osborn testified before Congress in 1971;“They all died. There was never any reasonable establishment of the fact thatany one of those individuals was, in fact, cooperating with the VC, but they alldied and the majority were either tortured to death or things like thrown out ofhelicopters.”The Phoenix interrogation centres were renowned for the methods of torture usedthere, including:\"Rape, gang rape, rape using eels, snakes, or hard objects, and rape followed bymurder; electric shock ('the Bell Telephone Hour') rendered by attaching wiresto the genitals or other sensitive parts of the body, like the tongue; the'water treatment'; the 'airplane' in which the prisoner's arms were tied behindthe back, and the rope looped over a hook on the ceiling, suspending theprisoner in midair, after which he or she was beaten; beatings with rubber hosesand whips; the use of police dogs to maul prisoners.\"[180][part0000_split_023.html#_edn180]Similar terrorising and dehumanising techniques were encouraged in other areasof interest to the agency. Noam Chomsky described a deserter's account of thetraining received by CIA-backed Salvadoran death squads;\"... draftees were made to kill dogs and vultures by biting their throats andtwisting off their heads, and had to watch as soldiers tortured and killedsuspected dissidents - tearing out their fingernails, cutting off their heads,chopping their bodies to pieces and playing with the dismembered arms forfun.\"[181] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn181]The Contras' brutality earned them a wide notoriety. They regularly destroyedhealth centres, schools, agricultural cooperatives and community centres whichwere seen as symbolic of the Sandinistas development in rural areas of thecountry.People caught in these assaults were often tortured and killed in the mostshocking ways. One example, reported in The Guardian, described such an attack;\"Rosa had her breasts cut off. Then they cut into her chest and took out herheart. The men had their arms broken, their testicles cut off, and their eyespoked out. They were killed by slitting their throats and pulling the tongue outthrough the slit.\"[182] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn182]This was in no way random; the terrorism was dictated right down to the specificmethods of torture, murder and mayhem best suited to destroying the moral of thegeneral populous. William Blum, author of Killing Hope: US Military and CIAInterventions Since World War II, has discussed these methods at length andexposed the fact that the CIA had codified the most effective methods ofinterrogation, coercion and terrorisation and helpfully published them in amanual for distribution amongst whichever particular uprising it was supportingat the time.“After many Contra atrocity stories had been reported in the world press, it wasdisclosed in October 1984 that the CIA had prepared a manual of instruction forits clients which encouraged, amongst other things, the use of violence againstcivilians. In the wake of the furore in Congress caused by the exposé, the StateDepartment was obliged to publicly condemn the Contras' terrorist activities.Congressional intelligence committees were informed by the CIA, by present andformer Contra leaders, and by other witnesses that the Contras indeed, \"raped,tortured and killed unarmed civilians, including children\" and that \"groups ofcivilians, including women and children, were burned, dismembered, blinded andbeheaded.”[183] [part0000_split_023.html#_edn183]Entitled Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare, the CIA manual providedadvice and instructions on the finer points of mob violence, kidnapping,political assassination, blackmail and arson and destruction of publicbuildings. The manual included specific instructions for when first entering atown, recommending;“\"Establish a public tribunal\" where the guerrillas can \"shame, ridicule andhumiliate\" Sandinistas and their sympathizers by \"shouting slogans and jeers\".\"If ... it should be necessary ... to fire on a citizen who was trying to leavethe town\", guerrillas should explain that \"he was an enemy of the people\" whowould have alerted the Sandinistas who would then \"carry out acts of reprisalssuch as rapes, pillage, destruction, captures, etc”.\"[184][part0000_split_023.html#_edn184]The contents of this and other manuals produced by the CIA, as we havepreviously demonstrated, came directly from the studies of coercion andmanipulation performed by William Sargant and Ewen Cameron.The Phoenix Program was overseen by William Colby, who, upon his return to theU.S., was made Director of the CIA. By bizarre coincidence this was almostexactly the same time that a new and terrifying element of American life was inits infancy, namely the serial killer. As the Phoenix Program wound up itsoperations in Vietnam and the grisly murders stopped, a series of individualsbegan perpetrating their own gory renditions in the U.S. These killings servedto terrify the populous; no one was safe, this new breed of killer murderedseemingly at random, for pleasure, with no moral justification in the selectionof their victims. They attacked when you were seemingly safe, in your mostintimate and private moments, even in your home, leaving horrific scenes ofmutilation, depravity and sexual brutality. Men, women and children were all atrisk; suddenly anyone and everyone was a potential target.In the following years, many of the so-called superstars of serial killing madetheir appearance on the U.S. media stage. These included Ted Bundy, Henry LeeLucas, Arthur Shawcross, David Berkowitz, Richard Ramirez, John Wayne Gacy,Jeffrey Dahmer, Charles Ng and Leonard Lake. Is it merely a coincidence that theserial killer explosion began so soon after the culmination of operations inVietnam, or had the Phoenix Program been brought home?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEEN: PHOENIX RISES Many renowned ‘serial killers’ have explicit links to the military, the policeforce or the military industrial complex in general. Several were officiallyused in military drug experimentation and even MK ULTRA. As we have previously established, Whitey Bulger took part in MK ULTRAexperiments and was given LSD personally by Sidney Gottlieb, head of the MKULTRA programme. Bulger was a mob boss and crime kingpin who ran racketeeringand gambling operations in his home city of Boston, Massachusetts, beginning hisillegal activities in the 1950’s. Bulger has recently been indicted for a totalof nineteen murders. Interestingly, Bulger has served as an informant for the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation](FBI) since as early as 1975. Seemingly, he was allowed to act with impunity inreturn for information given to the authorities concerning the Patriarca crimefamily [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarca_crime_family]. In 1997, the media in New England began to expose the many criminal actionsperformed by federal, state and local law enforcement officials, who weredirectly tied to the crimes of Bulger. On 23 December 1994, Bulger fled Boston[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston] and went into hiding after receiving adirect tip off from his former FBI handler. This was regarding a pending RICOindictment, which would have resulted in certain imprisonment for Bulger. Thanksto the FBI handler, Bulger managed to evade capture for a total of sixteen yearsuntil his eventual arrest in 2011, aged 81. Ted Kaczynski, also known as the ‘Unabomber’, sent sixteen bombs through thepost to several targets, including universities and airlines from 1978 to 1995.Three people were killed and twenty three injured. Official CIA records showthat Kaczynski took part in official MK ULTRA testing, conducted at HarvardUniversity [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University] from the autumn of1959 through to the spring of 1962. When researching these experiments, whichreportedly focussed on ‘applying stress’ to the subjects, many described them as\"disturbing\" and \"ethically indefensible\". Kaczynski is accredited with writinga manifesto, explaining that his actions were necessary in order to highlightthe increasing erosion of human freedom brought about by advancing technology.In the manifesto, the author wrote in the plural, using phrases such as ‘we’ and‘our’. There is considerable debate as to whether or not Kaczynski actuallycomposed the manifesto, or even if he was the true culprit of the bombingcampaign. David Berkowitz, the alleged ‘Son of Sam’ killer, joined the U.S. army at theage of 18 in 1971 and served in the United States and South Korea. Whilst in thearmy, Berkowitz reportedly experimented with LSD, marijuana, mescaline andamphetamines. Many researchers have suggested that this experimentation was partof MK ULTRA-style testing and that the source of his drug use was in fact themilitary. An army friend of Berkowitz's named Terry Patterson, who served withhim in Korea, claimed that Berkowitz was given LSD by the ‘brass’ whilst in thearmy. According to those who served with him, Berkowitz was also placed into amysterious ‘special’ programme, reportedly for \"profiled\" candidates. Theinclusion into the ‘special’ programme was reportedly after Berkowitz made arequest for conscientious objector status. Conspiracy researcher Mae Brussellwas convinced that Berkowitz was an “MK-ULTRA patsy” and often referred to himas \"Son of Uncle Sam\". From July 1976 until his arrest in August 1977, Berkowitz allegedly terrorisedthe New York area with a series of shootings of young couples, generally foundin parked cars. The type of weapon used in the attacks (a Bulldog .44) earnedhim the nickname ‘The .44 Calibre Killer’, until his rebranding as the ‘Son ofSam’. Shortly after his arrest in August 1977, Berkowitz made a full confessionto killing six people and wounding several others in the course of eightshootings, although some of the details of his claims were strangely inaccurate. The ‘Son of Sam’ nickname was initially attributed to Berkowitz’s neighbour’sdog, which, it was claimed, was possessed by a demon who instructed Berkowitzinto murderous action. The dog was named Sam according to the media, however, inreality, the dog’s owner was the fabled Sam. Berkowitz later implicated Sam Carras the father of Michael and John, prominent members of the New York chapter ofa satanic cult-oriented killing squad. Michael and John were literally the ‘Sonsof Sam’. The group reportedly carried out murders on request, for a variety ofreasons ranging from paid hits, to revenge attacks, to arranged killings to berecorded and sold as snuff films. The squad seemed to overlap in many ways withthe Manson family and the Zodiac killings, indicating a nationwide cult ofkillers for hire. This may seem implausible but the supporting evidence isactually very convincing. Berkowitz later amended his original confession to the crimes, to claim that hewas only involved in the shootings during two of the incidents, personallykilling three people and wounding a fourth. The other victims were killed,Berkowitz claimed, by members of the satanic[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanism] cult [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult]of which he was a member. Many officials involved in the original ‘Son of Sam’case suspected that more than one person was committing the murders. The ‘Son ofSam’ case was reopened by the District Attorney in 1996 and, as of 2004, isstill considered officially open, meaning they are still looking for furtherculprits. Journalist Maury Terry published the definitive investigation into thebroader cult of the Son of Sam, The Ultimate Evil, in which he evidenced atleast one of the killings was filmed in order to be sold to a wealthy client. Gary Heidnik was convicted in 1988 of the kidnap, rape[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape] and torture of six women, havingsimultaneously kept them prisoner in the cellar of his home. Two of the womendied, one through a combination of starvation and torture and the other throughelectrocution. Heidnik enrolled at Staunton Military Academy at the tender age of 14, at thebehest of his father. He then joined the United States Army[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army] at 17, despite being too youngto officially enlist. With no prior interest or orientation to the post anddespite his applications to several other areas of the military, including themilitary police [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_police], Heidnik was sentto San Antonio [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio], Texas[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas], to be trained as a medic. Some researchershave suggested this may have been in order to give him the requisite ‘blooding’,needed to accustom him to gore and death. Later, Heidnik was transferred to the46th Army Surgical Hospital in Landstuhl[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landstuhl], West Germany[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany], where he was placed in a number ofmedical experiments conducted with LSD. In August of 1962, Heidnik began complaining of severe headaches. His symptomsworsened and he became dizzy, nauseous and his vision blurred. A hospitalneurologist identified his symptoms as typical of a patient suffering frommental illness and immediately administered Stelazine[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifluoperazine], a favourite of William Sargant,in order to curb Heidnik’s growing mania. In October, Heidnik was transferred toa military hospital in Philadelphia, where he was examined and diagnosed with aschizoid personality disorder[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder]. After serving fora total of thirteen months, Heidnik received an honourable discharge[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge] from the army. In 1980, whilst serving his first prison sentence for the kidnap, rape andimprisonment of his girlfriend’s mentally disabled sister, Heidnik passed a noteto a warder, explaining that Satan had forced a cookie into his throat,preventing him from talking. For the next two years and three months, Heidnikremained absolutely silent. Timothy McVeigh was a United States Army[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army] veteran who allegedlydetonated a fertiliser-based bomb in front of the Alfred P. Murrah FederalBuilding [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_P._Murrah_Federal_Building] inOklahoma City [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City]. The incident, whichkilled 168 people and injured over 800 more on 19 April 1995, is more commonlyknown as the Oklahoma City Bombing[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Bombing]. McVeigh, like Heidnik, wasgiven an honourable discharge from the U.S. Army in May 1992, after beingrejected from Special Forces training on the grounds of being “mentallyunsuitable” . He claimed that a computer tracking chip, through which he couldbe controlled, was implanted in his buttocks during his time in the army andcomplained constantly to friends about it itching him. The asymmetrical shape of the damage left in the building proves that the ‘truckbomb’ allegedly used by McVeigh could not have been the only weapon involved inthe attack. In order to cause the damage seen at the Alfred P. Murrah building,the truck left by McVeigh would need to contain far more explosive material thanthe vehicle could physically carry, meaning it could not have been the onlysource of explosives. Several video tapes taken by security cameras show a manof Middle Eastern origin arriving with McVeigh, in the truck said to containexplosives; the authorities have never attempted to locate or identify this man. For no apparent reason, but by incredible good fortune, the FBI and ATF werealready on site before the blast actually occurred, wearing full blast-resistantgear. Specific staff members from the building reportedly received messages thatmorning, warning them of a potential bomb plot and encouraging them not toattend work. In the aftermath, investigators on site reported finding at least two unexplodedbombs still present inside the building after the initial blast, which clearlypoints to a larger involvement than simply McVeigh and a few disgruntledfriends. Several researchers have promoted the theory that bombs were actuallyplanted within the columns of the federal building, which would go some way asto explaining the asymmetrical patterns of damage and the rumoured secondarydevices. As this would require intimate access to the very core of the federalbuilding, the suggestion is that the military industrial complex or elements ofthe government had to be involved in the attack. The reports of other devicesfound at the site were largely ignored by the media. Jeffrey Dahmer murdered seventeen men and boys between 1978 and 1991, mutilatingtheir corpses and keeping various body parts in his home. His crimes includedrape, necrophilia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrophilia] and cannibalism[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism], the stages of which he recorded in aseries of photographs displayed around his apartment. Dahmer was reportedlytrying to create a ‘slave’ companion to live with him in his house. Heexperimented with several drugs and carried out home made lobotomies on hisvictims, at times drilling through the skulls and pouring acid into the brainsof his living captives. Dahmer was also using the steam-cleaned bones of hisvictims to construct a large alter to be used in Satanic rituals. Dahmer was apparently forced to enlist in the U.S. army by his father. Duringhis time in the forces he was sent to the same base in Germany where GaryHeidnik received LSD from his superiors (46th Army Surgical Hospital inLandstuhl [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landstuhl]). Like Heidnik, he aspired tobe a military police officer but was refused and instead sent to be a medic. Hewas kicked out the army in 1981 due to his chronic alcoholism and yet strangelyreceived an honourable discharge and the maximum available benefits. Leonard Lake and Charles Ng killed at least twelve women after kidnapping them,holding them hostage in an underground bunker and filming them as they weretortured, raped and brutalised. Dozens of videotapes were retrieved from thebunker, although only snippets have seen the light of day. In the tapes Ng andLake can be heard to say, “Suffer… there are people who will want to know thatwe have done our jobs”. As in the case of the ‘Son of Sam’, the suggestion isthat snuff films were being manufactured to order. Lake joined the Marine Corps[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps] in 1965 when aged 19and saw two tours of duty [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_of_duty] in theVietnam War [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War]. He reportedly served asa radar [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar] operator, although some of thegruesome stories he told suggested he was very probably involved in the PhoenixProgram. Lake was given a medical discharge[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge] from the army in 1971 afterbeing diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder], for which hereceived weeks of unspecified treatment at a military hospital. When arrested,Lake committed suicide during the taped interview session, using a cyanide pillhe had somehow managed to hide in his shirt collar. Charles Ng was born in Hong Kong [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong] in1960 and was the son of a wealthy executive businessman. Despite not being aU.S. citizen, in late 1979, Ng enlisted in the United States Marine Corps[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps]. After serving lessthan a year, he was dishonourably discharged[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge], a remarkably light punishmentconsidering he had been caught and charged with the theft[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft] of heavy weaponry and machine guns[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_gun] from MCAS Kaneohe Bay[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Base_Hawaii], a Marine Corps arsenal. Charles Whitman killed sixteen people and wounded thirty two others during ashooting rampage at the University of Texas at Austin[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin]. Whitman beganfiring upon random passers-by from the top of the university’s clock tower,having previously murdered his wife and mother. Sceptics have queried whetherWhitman could possibly have acted alone; the large wooden case containingseveral rifles, shotguns, small arms, scopes, ammunition and provisions wouldsurely be too wieldy for one person to manoeuvre up nearly three hundred feet ofwinding staircase? Whitman perfected his deadly, accurate shooting skills in theU.S. Marine Corps. Howard Unruh is generally considered to be the first example in American historyof a ‘spree’ killer, setting out on a gun-toting rampage that resulted inthirteen deaths. Unruh, aged 28 at the time, left his house on the morning of 6September 1949 and managed to kill all of his victims within twelve minutes. The rampage was driven by his apparent paranoia that his neighbours wereridiculing him, finally snapping when his garden gate was stolen. There areseveral bizarre elements to the case, including the extremely detailed diariesUnruh kept, listing his believed reasons for retaliation against people in hisneighbourhood. Unruh also told officers after his arrest that he had viewedthree showings of a double feature, I Cheated the Law[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=I_Cheated_the_Law&action=edit&redlink=1]and The Lady Gambles [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lady_Gambles], the nightbefore the murders and had come to believe the actress Barbara Stanwyck was inleague against him. When captured, Unruh was able to reel off a detailedsecond-by-second account of his actions, displaying an almost hypnotic recall ofevents. He was interrogated for over two hours and it was only after theinterview had been terminated that the police discovered a serious gunshot woundto Unruh’s thigh, of which he had previously exhibited no signs of pain. Unruh was a veteran of World War II and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. Hewas honourably discharged from the U.S. army in 1945. John Allen Muhammad was better known as the ‘Washington Sniper’ or the ‘BeltwaySniper’. He, along with his younger accomplice, Lee Boyd Malvo[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Boyd_Malvo], carried out a series of seeminglyrandom attacks in 2002, killing ten people. Muhammad enlisted in the Louisiana Army National Guard in 1979 as an armyreserve and volunteered for active duty in 1986, later seeing combat in thefirst Gulf War. During his time in the army, Muhammad earned the ExpertRifleman's Badge[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marksmanship_Badge_(United_States)], which is theU.S. Army's highest rating of marksmanship that can be awarded to a basicsoldier. He was honourably discharged from military service, leaving with therank of Sergeant, in 1994. In his confession, Muhammad’s accomplice Lee Boyd Malvo[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Boyd_Malvo] admitted that their intent was tokill six people a day in order to “terrorise the nation”, using a turn of phrasewith striking similarities to the raison d'etre of the infamous Phoenix Program. Bobby Joe Long reportedly kidnapped, raped and murdered[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder] at least 10 women in the Tampa Bay Area[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Area] during an eight month period in1984. Long left the bodies of his victims in woodland areas or near rural backroads; investigators described the corpses as “displayed”, due to the strangeand disturbing arrangements they were found in, often still bound and with thelegs twisted into unusual positions. Long was arrested for the kidnap and sexualassault of his final victim, who he reportedly tortured for over twenty fourhours before deciding, somewhat unwisely some may argue, to release her. Longconfessed to nine murders during his police interview, although strangely he wasprovided with no lawyer until his trial, which began rather unusually at thesentencing stage due to a plea bargain which assumed Long’s guilt. A little known fact is that Bobby Joe Long was the first cousin of notoriouskiller Henry Lee Lucas, who reportedly notched up somewhere in the region ofthree hundred victims. One can only imagine what Christmas was like at theirfamily get-togethers. Long reportedly enlisted in the army in September 1972 and was sent to FortBenning, also known as the ‘school of the assassins’ due to the designatedfacility for training South American death squads housed in its grounds.Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare was likely on the reading list atthis particular establishment. Long reportedly spent a considerable length oftime recovering from a motorcycle accident in a military hospital and was,according to his family, honourably discharged early with full medical benefits. Arthur Shawcross was also known as ‘The Genesee River Killer’, having committedfourteen murders, twelve after being released early from a prison sentence forthe manslaughter of a child. In 1972 Shawcross raped and strangled a 10 year oldboy before mutilating and cannibalising his body. He abandoned the remains ofthe corpse, later returning to the destroyed and decomposing cadaver on severaloccasions to have sex with it. Three months later, Shawcross similarly murdered,raped, mutilated and cannibalised an 8 year old girl. Despite a full confessionto all aspects of the crime, Shawcross was bizarrely merely charged with themanslaughter of the girl. This was due to a plea bargain which resulted in acustodial sentence of twenty five years. Shawcross only actually served fifteenbefore he was cheerfully paroled, this despite a less than exemplary prisonrecord that included numerous charges such as fighting, possession of weaponsand arson. The stated conditions of his parole were that he was to have no contact withchildren or prostitutes and he was not to drink; any violation of the law wouldalso, normally, result in arrest and re-imprisonment. Shawcross was, however,known to frequent red light districts on a regular basis after his release andhe was also given a traffic ticket for driving a car that was not registered tohim, with no license or insurance, in the company of two children of mysteriousorigin who were not wearing seatbelts. Strangely, he received no punishment forthis major violation of the conditions of his parole. Shawcross was well knownto the local police and would often hang out and chat for hours at the localdoughnut store with the numerous friends he had on the force. Following his release from prison, a further total of twelve victims wereattributed to him, with Shawcross’ signature mutilations and atrocities enactedon them. Shawcross was also considered the chief suspect in at least nineteensimilar murders, for which he was not charged. According to his own confession, Shawcross had already killed approximatelythirty nine victims, often mutilating and cannibalising their copses, prior tohis first ‘illegal’ murder, that of the 10 year old boy. He reportedly committedthese acts whilst in the employ of the American government, in Vietnam. Thoughhis official records state that he was nothing more than an office worker,Shawcross was seemingly a weapons specialist who worked on particularly brutalmissions. The victims Shawcross described were Vietnamese women and children,seemingly rounded up in Phoenix Program operations. He boasted on severaloccasions of raping and then decapitating his victims in Vietnam, claiming tohave, on at least one occasion, cannibalised a woman’s body in front of anotherwoman in order to terrify her. When asked how he managed to kill with suchapparent ease and emotional detachment, Shawcross answered, “Ask Uncle Sam”. When examined by a number of psychiatrists and physicians, Shawcross reportedlyexhibited multiple personalities, including that of an 11 year old boy and acannibal living in the thirteenth century. Evidence of multiple personalitieswas disregarded during his trial. Danny Rolling, also known as ‘The Gainesville Ripper’, murdered[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder] five university students in Florida[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainesville,_Florida] in the 1990’s, raping threeof them first. He later admitted to committing three further murders inShreveport, Louisiana [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreveport,_Louisiana] in1989 and attempting to murder his father in May 1990. He executed the studentsin their apartments, mutilating the bodies and posing them in the room toachieve the maximum horrific effect. One of Rolling’s victims was decapitatedand posed with her head facing her sitting body, Phoenix Program-style. Rolling enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1971, although being 17 and too youngto legally sign up, his father had to complete the paper work for him. He wasdischarged after merely two years service, much of that time being spent inmilitary prisons and psychiatric wards. Albert De Salvo, ‘The Boston Strangler’, joined the army in 1948. His enlistmentwas openly accepted, despite being only 17 (noticing any patterns yet?) and onparole at the time for stealing a car. De Salvo was honourably discharged afterhis first tour of duty, which ran until 1951. He re-enlisted the day after hisdischarge and, in spite of being tried in a court-martial[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court-martial] during his term, De Salvo was againhonourably discharged after serving until 1956. During his time in the military,he was arrested and accused of abusing a 9 year old girl, although neverprosecuted. His second spell in the military took him to Germany, to the samefacilities visited by Gary Heidnik and Jeffrey Dahmer. No reliable physical evidence has ever been presented as to De Salvo’s guilt inthe murder of thirteen women, or even proving that he was ever present at any ofthe crime scenes. De Salvo’s confession to the crimes was induced, underhypnosis, by William Joseph Bryan who also was implicated in the programming ofRFK assassin Sirhan Sirhan. Bryan also claimed to have worked on the famousManchurian Candidate film. Although he was able to hypnotically tease aconfession from De Salvo, Bryan was unable to make the accused remember evenbasic details of the crime scenes or the crimes themselves. When questioned, DeSalvo often contradicted himself to the known evidence, leading some to believehe was in fact innocent. Although it has been reported that certain detailswithin his ‘confession’ were not known to the public, indicating De Salvo’sinvolvement, it must be noted that these details were available to his lawyer,who attended the hypnosis sessions and could have conceivably passed thisknowledge on to Bryan, a proven MK ULTRA practitioner. Interestingly, De Salvo was never charged with the crime of murder. Whilst beingtried for a series of robberies and sexual offences, his own lawyer, F. LeeBailey, in a decidedly bold legal move, introduced into evidence his own opinionthat his client was the famed ‘Boston Strangler’, ostensibly as an insanity pleadefence. Though the comments were stricken from the record by the judge, theeffect on the jury, and subsequently the public, was to cement De Salvo’s guilt,proving quite a defence tactic. De Salvo was offered a plea bargain resulting ina life sentence, which was only reasonable due to the fact that everybody ‘knew’he was the feared ‘Strangler’. The Zodiac Killer murdered at least five and possibly as many as thirteenvictims in the late 1960’s and early 1970’s. Many researchers have held that thekiller (or more likely, killers) had connections to aspects of the military. TheZodiac Killer sent several taunting letters to the media and the police, crypticmessages that detailed his crimes, which some have claimed used navy-codesymbols. Others have claimed the letters code corresponds to a rare concept ofthe mathematical formula of Pi and is connected to a mysterious secret societywith links to the Process Church of Final Judgement, the Four Pi movement. FourPi have been linked by other researchers to the Manson family killings and the‘Son of Sam’ murders. Evidence left at the scenes of the Zodiac attacks included footprints made by a‘wing walker’ shoe. This is a particular type of shoe designed to achievemaximum grip when walking on the wings of military planes and were onlyavailable to personnel within the military, from official military outlets. John Christie was an English serial killer[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer] who murdered at least eight women,including his own wife, from the 1940’s to 1950’s. The bodies of three of hisvictims were discovered in March 1953, hidden in an alcove in his kitchen, afterChristie moved out of his flat at 10 Rillington Place, London. His wife's bodywas found sequestered beneath the floorboards of the living room. Christie served as an infantryman in the First World War, during which time hewas apparently injured in a gas attack, his injuries leaving him permanentlyunable to raise his voice. Following his honourable discharge from the armedforces, Christie was imprisoned several times, for a series of crimes includingtheft [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft] and assault[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault]. He was recruited as a constable for theWar Reserve Police[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=War_Reserve_Police&action=edit&redlink=1]during World War II, when the authorities apparently failed to correctly checkhis criminal record. Christie strangled his victims after he had rendered them unconscious with gas.He later admitted that he had raped [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape] some ofthe unconscious women prior to killing them. Searches of his home by the police,preceding his arrest, were slapdash to say the least. Investigators missedseveral visible bones strewn about Christie’s garden, including a thigh bonewhich he was using to prop up his fence. A skull, previously dug up byChristie’s dog, had been handed in to the police but was deemed not suspiciousand filed away. Researchers believe that Christie killed at least four morewomen for which he was never charged. This is due to the discovery of clumps ofpubic hair, reportedly collected by Christie as trophies. Dennis Nilsen, also known as ‘The Muswell Hill Murderer’, killed fifteen youngmen in London, England [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London,_England] between1978 and 1983. He drowned or strangled his victims and kept the bodies in hisflat for long periods of time, before eventually dissecting[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissecting] their remains and disposing of them,either by burning or flushing them down the drains. After the murders, Nilsenwould bathe the corpses and redress them, then store the bodies underfloorboards and at various places around his home. When in custody, Nilsenadmitted to having sex with the bodies of several of his victims. Nilsen joined the Army [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army] in 1961,serving for 11 years and earning a General Service Medal[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Service_Medal_(1962)] before beinghonourably discharged, at his own request, in November 1972. In December of thesame year he joined the Metropolitan Police[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Service] Force and servedeight months as a policeman before resigning. Robert Lee Yates is known to have murdered at least thirteen prostitutes duringa two year reign of terror, beginning in 1996 in the seedier districts ofSpokane, Washington. When arrested, Yates confessed to three further murders;two committed in 1975 in the city of Walla Walla and one in 1988, which tookplace in Skagit County. Yates enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1975; during his career, which spannednineteen years, he was stationed in several countries including Germany (as wasGary Heidnik, Albert De Salvo, Rick Davis and Jeffrey Dahmer). In the 1990’s, hebecame a U.N. peace keeper in Somalia. Awards bestowed upon Yates during hiscareer included three Army Achievement medals, three Army Commendation medals,two Armed Forces Expeditionary medals and three Meritorious Service medals. Dean Corll abducted, raped, tortured and eventually murdered at least twentyeight boys in Houston, Texas from 1970 to 1973. He was assisted in hisabductions by two accomplices, David Brooks and Elmer Henley, both aged 15 in1970, when their involvement first began. Brooks and Henley, almost exactlymirroring Paul Bonnaci of the Franklin child prostitution scandal, were used tolure children to Corll’s home. Corll had explained that he was involved with achild prostitution ring based in Dallas and reportedly paid the boys two hundreddollars for each child they provided. The crimes became known as the ‘HoustonMass Murders, with Corll being given the nickname ‘The Candy Man’ or ‘The PiedPiper’ by the media, due to his family owning a sweet factory and his habit ofgiving free samples to dozens of local children. Corll was drafted and entered the U.S. Army in 1964. During what was describedas an “unblemished” army career, Corll was sent to Fort Benning ‘The School ofthe Assassins’ (as was Bobby Joe Long), to train in the repair of radioequipment, before moving to a permanent post at Fort Hood, Texas. Despite onlybeing in the Army for ten months, Corll was given an honourable discharge toallow him to return home and help with the family business. Richard Allen ‘Rick’ Davis abducted and murdered a twelve year old girl in 1993.No stranger to criminal pursuits, Davis was forced into the U.S. Army by a judgein 1970 as an alternative to prison. This was despite the fact that having onlyjust turned 17, he was technically too young to enlist. Davis, like severalothers on the list, was sent to West Germany where he remained for thirteenmonths, until his discharge from service for a series of petty crimes.Strangely, after his early discharge from the army, he received no furtherpunishment for his previous crimes or those committed during his service. Andrew Urdiales raped and murdered at least eight women, using either a gun orknife as his weapon of choice. Urdiales joined the U.S. Marine Corps shortlyafter graduating from high school in 1982 and served for eight years beforebeing honourably discharged. It is reported that upon leaving, he immediatelysought psychiatric treatment from the army, which seemingly continued until1996. Urdiales committed at least three murders whilst still serving as amarine. During his trial (following his arrest in 1997), family members and medicalstaff who examined Urdiales testified that mental illness ran rampant on bothsides of his family. Further revelations stated that he had been physically andemotionally abused by his parents, sexually abused by both his sister and a malecousin and that he had been picked on incessantly in school and during his timein the military. Although promoted to the rank of corporal, Urdiales was demotedas troops refused to take orders from him. It was also revealed that Urdiales heard voices, which delivered messages to him\"in code\". The deciphered codes would contain specific instructions, encouragingUrdiales to \"go on missions\", which he would dutifully complete. Michael Swango held various positions in the medical profession, initiallyworking as a licensed doctor. Several of the later posts were held illegally,under an assumed name, following a conviction for poisoning a number of hisco-workers in the mid-eighties. In the late nineties, Swango was convicted ofthe fatal poisoning of four patients, although it is accepted that he actuallymurdered as many as sixty people. Swango joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1972 and received an honourable dischargein 1976, following in the footsteps of his father who served as an officer inVietnam. Hugh Bion Morse raped and murdered at least four women, breaking into theirhouses and attacking them in their beds. He burglarised many homes and isbelieved to have been involved in several unsolved attacks, rapes, murders andmolestations. In 1955, Morse was charged with attempting to molest two 8 year old girls inFairfield, California. At trial he was committed to Atascadero state hospitalfor therapy, before being released as \"cured\" in January 1957. This was at atime when MK ULTRA experiments were prevalent at the hospital. Although Morsehad a varied criminal record prior to 1955, including burglary, indecentexposure and sexual assault, it was not until his release from Atascadero thathis felonies intensified to murder, the rate of his crimes also noticeablyincreasing. Morse served in the U.S. Marine corps from 1948 to 1951, when he wasdishonourably discharged and served six months in prison on a charge ofburglary. In 1961, Morse was placed on the FBI’s top ten ‘Most Wanted’ list and hispicture heavily publicised, following the attempted murder of his estrangedwife. Whilst in Georgia, Morse was charged with voyeurism and ordered to pay a$200 fine at the local police station. The police apparently failed to check foroutstanding warrants and also failed to notice his picture which was displayedon their own wanted list. Itzcoatl Ocampo stabbed six men to death in the Orange County area ofCalifornia, starting in 2011 and ending when arrested in January 2012. Ocampowas a veteran of the Iraq war, where he served as a U.S. Marine. His family andchildhood friends claimed that the previously friendly and fun-loving characterhad returned from Iraq “a changed person”, practically unrecognisable as the manwho had enlisted. It was also revealed that Ocampo had vivid hallucinations andheard voices following his return to the U.S. Donald Leroy Evans was convicted in the early nineties for the murders of twowomen and a 10 year old girl in Louisiana. Following his arrest upon suspicionof kidnapping the child, Evans confessed to her murder, revealed where he hadhidden her body and admitted to a further seventy murders carried out across atleast twenty states. His confessions seemingly matched the details of dozens ofunsolved murders that had plagued law enforcement agencies spanning the U.S.Evans strangled his victims in deserted areas of public parks, in a spreespanning from 1970 until his arrest in 1991. Evans enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1975 but was discharged after servingfor only forty eight weeks, due to undisclosed psychiatric problems. Courtrecords state that Evans received psychiatric treatment at military hospitals inIllinois and Michigan in 1978 and 1979. Robert Charles Browne was convicted in 1995 for the murder of a woman and theseparate murder of a 15 year old girl. In his confession to the police, Browneadmitted to dispatching a further forty nine people, committing the first in1970. He confessed to murders in Colorado, Washington, California, New Mexico,Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, killing his victims bystrangulation or stabbing. Browne dropped out of high school and enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1969,although he was only 17 at the time. He served until 1976, when he wasdischarged for drug abuse. During his service he saw action in the Korean War asa medic. Harvey Carignan murdered at least five women in Alaska, Washington andMinnesota, usually killing his victims with a hammer. Carignan reportedly camefrom a fairly abusive family life, being shipped between family members until hewas sent to reform school in Mandan at age 11, where he remained for sevenyears. During this time he was diagnosed with childhood chorea, a nervousdisorder characterized by muscular twitching and writhing of legs, arms andface. He was also a chronic bed wetter who had a vivid relationship with animaginary friend and claimed that female employees at the school sexually abusedhim. When he left the reform school at age 18, he enlisted in the U.S. Army. In 1949, while stationed at Fort Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, Carignan rapedand murdered 57 year old Laura Showatler. Carignan also attempted to rapeanother woman, Dorcas Callen, who escaped and alerted the authorities; thisarrest led to his confession to the previous murder. Although initiallyreceiving a death sentence for the crime, his punishment was reduced, apparentlydue to the method by which the confession was obtained. Carignan was released onparole in 1960. Following his release, Carignan failed to keep on the straight and narrow andwas arrested for several crimes, including burglary and assault. In 1965, he wassentenced to fifteen further years in prison but with time off for goodbehaviour, was released within four. Carignan began his murderous spree in earnest in 1972, resulting in the deathsof at least five women before he was arrested two years later. Dennis Rader murdered at least ten people in the Wichita Kansas area from 1974to 1991. Rader earned the nickname the ‘BTK’ (Blind, Torture, Kill) Killer dueto his modus operandi; binding the victim and torturing them for extendedperiods before killing them. During his spree, Rader taunted the local policeand media with letters detailing his crimes. Rader spent four years in the U.S.Air Force, from 1966 to 1970. Randy Kraft, also known as the ‘Freeway Killer’ or the ‘Score-Card Killer’, wasconvicted for sixteen murders carried out in the 1970s and 1980s, the victimsdumped alongside California’s freeway road network. Kraft was very stronglysuspected to have committed at least fifty further murders for which he was notcharged. Kraft’s victims were young men and boys, most of whom showed signs of savagetorture and sexual abuse upon discovery. Many had high levels of alcohol andtranquilizers found in their bloodstreams, indicating they were renderedhelpless before being tortured. Kraft's methodology varied, dispatching some bystrangulation and others by gunshot. Several of Kraft’s victims were themselvesin the military [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Military], apparently pickedup by Kraft when hitchhiking between army bases. Many victims had deep bite marks around the genitals and nipples or werediscovered with their genitalia, head or eyes removed entirely. Victims wereusually found with their trousers removed or unzipped, exposing the badly bittenor completely removed sexual organs. Evidence suggests that Kraft did not act alone in his crimes, with unaccountedfor footprints and semen found at several scenes. Similar to several others onthe list, Kraft documented his killings with a series of photos, although it wasnever discovered exactly where, or indeed who, had processed the macabrekeepsakes, as Kraft had neither the knowledge nor the facilities to do sohimself. Kraft joined the U.S. Air Force [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Air_Force] in1968. During his career, due to the high scores Kraft received on militaryaptitude tests, he was provided with top level security clearances. For themajority of his time in the Force he was stationed at Edwards Air Force Base[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwards_Air_Force_Base], California. Gary Ridgway was also known as the ‘Green River Killer’. He was convicted of themurders of forty eight women, although he confessed to killing at least doublethat number. During the 1980’s and 1990’s, Ridgway strangled his victims anddisposed of their bodies by the banks of the Green River in Washington orforested areas of nearby King County, often returning to the decomposing corpsesin order to have sex with them. At age 20 Ridgway joined the U.S. Navy[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy] and was later sent to Vietnam[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War], where he served on board a supplyship [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_ship] and apparently saw combat. Roy Norris and Lawrence Bittaker were known collectively as the ‘Tool BoxKillers’; in 1979 they kidnapped, raped, tortured and murdered five young women.Norris joined the U.S. Navy aged 17, where he was happily accepted despite hisage making him ineligible. During his time in the navy he spent four months inVietnam. Anthony Sowell, also known as the ‘Cleveland Strangler’, was arrested in 2009 asa suspect in the disappearances of several women. The decomposing corpses ofeleven victims were discovered hidden in his small Ohio apartment, leading tohis prosecution and subsequent death sentence. Sowell entered the U.S. Marine Corps[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps] in 1978 at the age of19 and remained in active service until 1985. ‘The Sunset Strip Killers’ had at least seven murders attributed to them; mostof the victims were prostitutes and most were shot in the head. Douglas Clark, one half of ‘The Sunset Strip Killers’, was born in 1948; hisfather was Navy Lieutenant Commander Franklyn Clark. Douglas Clark began hiscareer in the U.S. Air Force in the late 1960’s and was enlisted into the radiointelligence department; Clark had previously been educated at the prestigiousCulver Military Academy. Clark, like many others on this list, was honourablydischarged from military service early but still received full benefits. Clark’sfather, the aforementioned Lieutenant Commander Franklyn Clark, had worked onthe U.S. military’s atomic bomb testing programme. Clark’s accomplice in these crimes was a woman named Carol Bundy, who hadbriefly been a child actress, appearing in the original Miracle on 34th Streetand reportedly coming from a background of sexual abuse at the hands of herfather. Richard Ramirez, ‘The Nightstalker’, murdered fourteen people in the Los Angelesarea in the mid 1980’s. Ramirez acquired his nickname from his habit ofattacking his victims in their beds, after silently gaining entry into theirhomes. He committed his murders with at least two guns, but also used knives,blunt objects and electrical cords to torture, and ultimately dispatch, hisvictims. Although Ramirez had no direct links to the military himself, his cousin Mike,who acted as his guardian at times and his mentor for the majority of his life,certainly did. Mike was a Vietnam veteran, who reportedly was stationed withSpecial Forces. He returned to America with twenty nine confirmed kills and toldtales of being encouraged to terrorise and brutalise women and children by hissuperiors in the ‘special task force’; it would seem apparent that Mike wasinvolved with the Phoenix Program. Mike possessed a collection of eight severed,shrunken heads, which he had reportedly prepared himself and a large portfolioof Polaroid photos, depicting his escapades in Vietnam, which he wouldenthusiastically encourage the young Richard to study. The photographs showedscenes of rape, murder, mutilation and torture enacted by Mike and were recordedover two complete tours. Mike reportedly spent time in the Texas State MentalHospital and after his release, introduced the young Richard to the intricaciesof satanic worship. When Richard was thirteen, Mike shot and killed his own wife in front of hisyoung cousin. Mike’s now ex-wife’s blood reportedly splashed across the youngRichard’s face. The military is not the only government agency to have links with the possibleproliferation of these types of terrorising crimes; other killers have enjoyedvery cosy relationships with the police. As we have seen, John Christie andDennis Nilsen both worked as policemen, David Berkowitz was a member of theauxiliary police force and Arthur Shawcross had several friends within lawenforcement. Additionally, one cannot help but notice the numerous police‘errors’ that allowed these killers to continue their murderous rampages. Inmany cases the police failed to act on leads, showed incredible leniency tosuspects or flat out ignored evidence that could have resulted in an earlierarrest. An example of this is shown in the case of Jeffrey Dahmer. 14 year old KonerakSinthasomphone was discovered by two women, stark naked, bleeding from therectum and obviously heavily drugged, wandering the streets of Milwaukee in theearly hours of the morning. Dahmer approached the boy and attempted to forciblydrag him away from the scene. The women prevented him from doing so, protectedthe teenager and called the police. Despite the women’s objections, the policewho attended believed Dahmer’s explanation that the boy (who spoke no English)was his 19 year old lover and turned him over to the killer. The police evenescorted ‘the couple’ back to Dahmer’s apartment, where, after a cursory glance,they decided all was in order. The police apparently missed the corpse lying onDahmer’s bed and also failed to notice the overpowering stench of decomposingflesh that cloaked the property. Over the next few hours, Sinthasomphone wasmurdered, his corpse dismembered and his skull kept as a memento by Dahmer. John Wayne Gacy was convicted of the murders of thirty three young men in thelate 1970’s. At times, at least thirty bodies were buried beneath his home,decomposing under a layer of lime. In the late 1960’s Gacy was arrested and convicted of the rape of a young boy.Inexplicably, no action was pursued against Gacy by the police for severalmonths. When the case did come before a judge, Gacy received a ten year sentencebut served barely two. In prison, he was always able to obtain large supplies ofmoney, cigars and clothes, luxuries that were available to very few prisoners.It is reported that Gacy underwent radical electroshock treatment whilstincarcerated, in order to ‘cure’ him of his homosexual tendencies. This ishighly reminiscent of the removal of behaviour patterns practiced by MK ULTRAdoctors Ewen Cameron and William Sargent. After his release, Gacy violated his parole on numerous occasions, with chargesranging from violent conduct, to impersonating a police officer, to aggravatedbattery and received no punishment. Following the disappearance of a local boy, after a remarkably long time andseveral complaints from the missing boy’s parents, the police agreed to set up atask force to survey the Gacy property and Gacy himself, for whom the missingboy worked. Gacy would often socialise with his own police surveillance team, taking themfor dinner or inviting them into his home for coffee and a friendly chat. Atthis time, at least thirty bodies were decomposing beneath Gacy’s floorboards.Later searches of the property, carried out mere days after the surveillanceteam were entertained at the home, reported a nauseating and all-encompassingstench of death lingering throughout the entire building. On several occasions, Gacy sped around his local town in his car, trying toshake off the task force assigned to watch him, often racing through the streetsat speeds of up to one hundred miles an hour, with his dinner guests in hotpursuit. Gacy was never stopped or charged with any illegal activity after thesereckless escapades. During an initial search of his home, police discovered several official policebadges and sets of handcuffs, alongside numerous items of missing boys clothing,jewellery and personal effects. No action was taken after the initial search andapparently none of the thirty bodies were discovered. At this point, fiveseparate individuals had filed assault claims against Gacy, prompting a secondsearch of his home, during which the bodies were discovered. When arrested Gacyasked, “Who else do you have in the station?” He initially claimed others were directly involved in the crimes. Whenquestioned, Gacy, despite his full confession, could remember little about themurders that matched the physical evidence available. Gacy attributed thekillings to an alter ego of his; a distinct personality he claimed was namedJack Hanley. Whilst being interviewed by psychiatrists prior to his trial, Gacy spokecandidly about corruption, wife swapping, pornography, gambling andprostitution, implicating top level members of local society, including severalmembers of the police force. Gacy had a file at the local police station whichwas curiously marked with the pseudonym ‘Colonel Gacy’. He seemingly knew somefairly influential people, including Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, AttorneyGeneral William Scott and local TV news anchorman Walter Jacobson. Gacy wasreportedly the cousin of Iowa mob boss Tony Accardo and at times he claimed towork for a shadowy organisation known as ‘The Syndicate’. Despite his initialconfession, he proclaimed his innocence of all crimes on several occasions,explaining that he was the scapegoat for a larger group. One curious item found in the Gacy home was a proudly displayed photograph,taken when John met the then-First Lady Rosalyn Carter and signed, “To JohnGacy. Best Wishes. Rosalyn Carter”. A particularly strange element of the photois that Gacy is wearing a discreet secret service ‘S’ lapel badge, indicatingthat he has been granted top level security clearance. Ed Kemper, also known as ‘The Co-ed Killer’, was active in the Santa Cruz areaof California in the early 1970’s. His crimes included rape, murder, mutilationand necrophilia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrophile]. When he was just aninfant, his father reportedly left for two years to work on the U.S. atomic bombtesting programme (as did Douglas Clark’s father). At 15 years old, Kemperexecuted his grandmother with a single bullet to the back of the head and thenshot and killed his grandfather. Kemper was detained at the Atascadero StateHospital [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atascadero_State_Hospital] for less thanfive years, before being deemed fit to re-enter society. Atascadero StateHospital is the same institution which MK ULTRA doctor Louis ‘Jolly’ West deemedsuitable for his proposed behaviour modification experimentation,euphemistically termed ‘aversion therapy’, utilising electro-shock and drugs. As an adult, Kemper killed and dismembered six female hitchhikers, in additionto his mother and one of her friends. After his final murder, Kemper calmlyhanded himself over to the authorities, aged just 24 years old. His confessiondetailed that he had beheaded his mother and then raped her decapitated corpse. Kemper was well known to the local police at the time of the killings; many ofthem were close personal friends and he had professed an interest in becoming apoliceman himself. He was a known to be a popular and regular attendee of thelocal ‘cop’ bar, known as The Jury Room. The Jury Room was frequented by most ofthe local area force, who all knew ‘Big Ed’ (he stood at 6ft 9) and the detailsof his grandparents’ murder. After his arrest, it was discovered that Kemper haddocumented his crimes with Polaroid photos, some of which were used as evidence. Gerard John Schaefer, also known as ‘The Killer Cop’, was convicted in 1973 forthe murders of two teenage girls in Martin County, Florida. Schaefer worked as aDeputy for the Martin County[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_County,_Florida]Sheriff's Department,having graduated as a patrolman in 1971. In 1972, he was stripped of his badgeand charged with the false imprisonment of two teenage girls, who he haddiscovered hitch hiking. Schaefer tied the girls up in a wooded area andthreatened to sell them to a prostitution ring. Two months after posting bail for the charges 1972, ‘The Killer Cop’ abducted,tortured [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture] and murdered Susan Place, aged17, and Georgia Jessup, aged 16. Following the discovery of their corpses in1973, Schaefer’s house was searched; inside the police discovered jewellery,clothing, personal effects and (in one case) teeth, belonging to at least eightwomen who had been reported missing over the preceding years. Although only convicted for two murders, authorities believe Schaefer wasresponsible for the disappearances of at least thirty further women and girls. All of the crimes listed terrified the general population and the killersthemselves have become enshrined into popular culture. All of the killers listedhave direct, or unusually strong, connections to the military or the police.Though it might seem implausible to some that these killers may have been usedby governments or agencies to commit atrocities, for the explicit purpose ofinducing terror, it cannot be denied that these tactics have already been usedto far greater degrees for that very purpose, by the very same government. Theexplicit intention of the Phoenix Program was to instil a sense of dread andabject terror in the population of a country; whether that was the desiredresult of the crimes of serial killers or merely a ‘fortunate’ coincidence, onecannot deny their effectiveness."},{"pageContent":"IN CONCLUSION The evidence presented in these pages verifies that government agencies acrossthe globe have a long-standing interest in mind control. We can see that thisfalls roughly into four categories: prizing the truth from a suspect duringinterrogations, wiping memory or locking memories into the subconscious so theycannot be retrieved without the appropriate techniques, the complete physicaland mental control of a subject and controlling the perceptions of the generalpublic through propaganda, advertising and the shaping of events. The mind control of individuals has been of particular interest to the U.K. andU.S. governments since as early as 1947 and in all likelihood, much earlier thanthat. There are several available techniques that have been tested and perfectedsince the 1940’s, including the use of drugs, torture, hypnosis and psychotronicmachinery. It would be naïve to believe that all avenues of mind control hadbeen abandoned by the present governments, government agencies and militaries ofthe world. One need only look at the interrogation methods practised at certainprisons across the globe to realise these techniques are still being used. One of the most disturbing aspects of the applied methodologies is thepossibility that Nazi experimentation played a part in their formation. This isby no means proven, although it is clear that governments from all corners ofthe globe appear to share doctors, drugs, practices and technology, if onlybehind the scenes. It is also clearly evidenced that both the U.K. and U.S. governments knowinglyemployed unethical and illegal testing methods on unwitting civilians, in orderto achieve their ends. This monstrous and wide-ranging human experimentation wasoften carried out by the very cream of the medical and psychological profession.The testimonies of various survivors of the whims of these ‘professionals’ givessupport to the documented evidence. A pressing concern is the recent military applications of mind controltechniques, including drugs, removal of emotions or memory and the use ofpsychotronic machinery to ‘improve’ the physicality of the modern soldier. Theconfessions from several military insiders, confirming the use of mind controltechniques to create assassins, add a further layer of fear and intrigue to thisclandestine science. This certainly allows for us to re-examine the cases ofso-called ‘lone nut’ killers of high profile victims, spree killers and evenserial killers as possible victims of external mind control. Even with theevidence presented, this concept seems difficult to believe, until we recognizethat governments intentionally create fear in both domestic and foreignpopulations in order to maintain control. This is clearly shown through militaryoperations such as the Phoenix Program and the Tavistock-inspired ‘shock troops’spreading their ‘social turbulence’ across the globe. One of the most important aspects is not to be frightened by the knowledge thatthese techniques exist. Fear is one of the key aims of controllers, freezing usin our tracks, halting our reasoning capability, so that we physically need torun to an authority figure. When we realise that fear is the ultimate goal ofthese techniques, we can step back and reappraise the world from a newperspective. The most important step you can take is to understand that theremay well be an agenda behind any piece of information presented to you and thenbegin to think for yourself."},{"pageContent":"REFERENCES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] [part0000_split_003.html#_ednref1] Scheflin, A.W., & Opton, E.M.
