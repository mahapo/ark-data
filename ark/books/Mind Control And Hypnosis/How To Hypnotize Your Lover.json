A couple, (I will name them Mr. and Mrs. Businessman) received the nod from the waiter and follow him right by my table to an adjacent booth. I overheard the wife say, \"Am I glad to have you home. That was a long business trip. Now, for a nice quiet, romantic lunch, just like we use to have.\" At that very moment, even before Mr. Businessman could acknowledge the comment, his cellular telephone made that all too familiar sound. It rang! Mr. Businessman took the call and for the next ten or twelve minutes, had no idea he was even in a restaurant ignoring his lover who he hadn't seen or had dinner with, in a very long time. Mrs. Businessman shooed away an impatient waiter three or four times as Mr. Businessman's phone conversation was rather lengthy. Finally, after what must have seemed like eternity, Mr. Businessman's call was terminated. Why was it terminated? I didn't hear a goodbye. I think Mr. Businessman's call was terminated because his battery was weak. In fact I think Mr. Businessman's battery was so weak it was really dead. This book and my workshops are designed to bring your battery and your lovers' battery back to life. This book and my workshops are designed to awaken a sleepy relationship. Man and woman, husband and wife, life partner and soul mate, parent and child, all will benefit by the techniques described in this short, yet powerful text on how to make your loving relationship much more caring and exciting. \"My mission in life is to help you achieve your mission in life.\" Hi, my name is Wayne F.

What is hypnosis? \"Hypnosis\" refers to the power that words and ideas have when we surround these words and ideas with our complete attention. A hypnotist or an operator delivers words and ideas. However, you or your lover may write them down or deliver them to each other through spoken language. You may record and deliver these words and ideas to your powerful subconscious mind or your lover's powerful subconscious mind. You don't need any special qualifications to deliver words that will change your life or help change your lover's life. Hypnosis, the power that words have when surrounded by your complete attention is as old as the spoken word itself. You or your lover may have a goal regarding losing a specific amount of weight. Your goal may be to sleep better at night. You may want to relax better during stressful periods during the day. Any and all goals that you are trying to accomplish in life may be accomplished through the use of hypnosis and these powerful goal-setting techniques. What fun you will have using the spoken word to change your lover's life!

It is!"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Fundamental Law of Attraction A basic psychological law applies to you and your lover and everyone else in the world. This is the basic psychological law that explains why hypnosis really works. The concept or law is called the fundamental law of attraction. The fundamental law of attraction as it applies to hypnosis is as follows: \"Whatever you hold in your mind at any given time, your body moves toward that direction. Your body can be directed to move in a physical, mental, emotional or spiritual direction.\" Think about eating your favorite food. Picture in your mind how wonderful it looks. Picture in your mind the color and texture of the food. Think about how it feels as you chew it. Think about how your favorite food tastes and smells. Feel it in your mouth. Notice how your mouth starts to fill with saliva as you think these thoughts. This is the law of attraction at work. You are holding the thoughts of your favorite food in your mind. As you think about it in great detail your body tends to move toward it by allowing the saliva to flow as if you are digesting the food in real life. Do you begin to salivate when walking by a bakery or in a movie theater when you smell the popcorn popping? Notice how your body seems to be goal oriented. We will capitalize on that goal orientation of the body and the law of attraction as we progress through the hypnosis exercises. Perkins Power of Four Rule   Hypnosis with you and your lover invokes Perkins Power of Four  Rule. What is Perkins Power of Four Rule  The states that whenever two people are hypnotizing each other to achieve a specific goal, four powerful minds are working together in unison. Let me explain. Your normal everyday waking state is called your conscious state of mind. This is the part of your mind that analyzes, and makes decisions based on objective criteria. This is the place where critical thinking takes place. Your mind generally pulls information out of short-term memory when making decisions using the conscious mind. With hypnosis you begin talking with and convincing the conscious mind. The subconscious mind involves making decisions based on subjective criteria. This is the part of your mind that is the \"automatic pilot.\" It selectively makes on decisions. Your mind generally pulls information out of long-term memory and associates criteria with similar feelings you had when making this kind of decision."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Sometimes the conscious mind and subconscious mind more in opposite directions. One major reason diet plans are so hard to maintain is that the subconscious mind has been programmed a long time on how it responds to food. As soon as the person goes off the diet, it continues to associate with the person's long term memory and long term history of overeating. Its this opposite direction going on between the conscious and subconscious minds that cause stress in our bodies and which reinforce negative habits. Hypnosis brings your conscious and subconscious minds together in a way that both will think alike and act together creating a powerful and dynamic force. When you hypnotize your lover and your lover hypnotizes you four minds are working together ; your conscious and subconscious mind and your lover's conscious and subconscious mind. With that kind of power going for your any and all goals are possible by properly using the joint powers of your minds... hypnosis. Let's move on."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 Can I Turn My Lover into A Duck? What Can I Use hypnosis for? Can I really turn my lover into a duck? Even though turning your lover into a duck may sound like fun at first. It really can become very annoying. This book focuses on building relationships based on trust, understanding and a mutual desire to improve your relationship. If you or your lover becomes a duck, not only will it defeat the intent of this book; it can get very messy in your bedroom as well! This chapter will list some of the areas in your life and that you can help yourself and your lover achieve success. Remember that this is my list and not yours. Let your imaginations run away with you and experiment with any goals that are important to you. Any and all goals that you and your lover present can be worked on using hypnosis. Work on one at a time until you achieve success in that area. Then move on to other important goals. Here are some areas that you can master hypnosis with your lover. What Can I Use Hypnosis For? Do you want to have fun with your lover? Do you want to help your life partner learn to become master of their mind and master of their destiny? Do you want to help your lover improve relations with you and others? Do you want to help yourself and your partner to overcome exam anxiety or improve in schoolwork? Do you both want to learn how to sleep better at night? Do you want to facilitate weight control or smoking cessation?"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Do you want to improve in sports performance?

Do you want to achieve any personal goals that you or your over can imagine? Begin to create a notebook you can keep by your bed at night. You may want to three-hole punch and bind each page. You may also want to copy and bind the text of this book for your use. In your notebook, create a section call \"goals.\" Meet with your lover and discuss goals you both wish to achieve. Ask your lover or friend, which goals are most important and which do you wish to begin working on. Goals are \"dreams with a deadline.\" As you and your partner create goals, create a timetable on when you want these goals to be fulfilled. You will be amazed at the results. You may want to begin with a very simple one in just reducing stress or sleeping better at night. Once you have achieved this goal, you may attack any and all goals and you should have similar success. The very first exercise we will perform in this book will work on the common everyday stress in the world and how to reduce it. You will also give and receive suggestions to assist you and your lover in sleeping soundly all night long. Your personal success is only limited by your imagination. You possess everything you need and your lover has everything he/she needs to help you achieve your goals. You can both celebrate in achieving your goals together! I recommend that once every month you have a meeting together to track the goals you have achieved and which ones still need to be worked on. In the next chapter you will begin your first official hypnosis session together. It will be fun. The best part about it is that you work with your partner on goal achievement for the rest of your lives."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Always having goals in front of you keep you healthy and young at heart. How Does It Work? You learn how to relax and open your mind toward self-hypnosis. As you learn to relax deeply on my command or request, a strange thing begins to happen. You begin to accept suggestions that will be of benefit to you. A suggestion is simply an idea or thought that is implanted into your subconscious mind and when teamed up with repetition, becomes reality. The body responds to the ideas or thoughts you put in your mind. After enough repetitions of these thoughts are received, the mind starts to reprogram itself to respond the way you want it to. How many repetitions does it take? It's hard to make any assumptions. Some people will begin to change their behavior after the very first session. Most people need many repetitions to insure that the desired behavior will override the undesired behavior. What Will You Learn To Do? You will learn how to present yourself with words and ideas. You will surround these words and ideas with your complete attention. Then you learn how to word suggestions in a way to give you the best opportunity to affect your subconscious mind. Then I teach you to create hypnotic prescriptions that are personal to you and specific to overcome your challenges and achieve your goals. You will then give yourself these suggestions or ideas many, many times before you finish the book. The good news is that repetition of these positive thoughts and ideas will eventually create your goal achievement. You will succeed! When Do We Start This Wonderful Journey? You and your lover may begin as soon as you read the very next chapter. Both of you will learn to appreciate each other more as you focus on communicating on a very basic level. This is the same level that parents imprint on their children before the age of seven. Children will carry these powerful thoughts and ideas with them as if they were imprinted in their DNA. Remember how a therapist will generally find a current"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"problem related directly to an event that happened long ago. Why not begin on your goals with a lover, recreating many of the conditions that were present when you were a small child? The innocence and acceptance of suggestions as a child will allow you to tap into your powerful subconscious minds. You will succeed! Both of you will get to enjoy a time and a place where income taxes, prejudice, wars, heartbreak, just don't exist. This is a time where security, the same security adults search for their entire lives, is yours. It will be yours every single night if you choose. But the best part is you both get to enjoy each other in the process. Does this sound like something you would like to do? Let's do it!"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 Your First Hypnotic Experience. Plan A...Every Day First of all, there is no button in your brain that you push to become hypnotized or dehypnotized. Do you really think that with your experiences in life, that you can possibly find a state of mind that never existed before in your history or your partner's history . Hypnosis is a state of mind. Becoming hypnotized is just following directions and concentrating so intently on a particular thought or string of thoughts, that nothing else that is going on around you seems to be distracting or very important. Since there is no button to push, there is no button to get stuck and have you frozen in hypnosis or self-hypnosis. In all of the history of hypnotism, no one has ever gotten stuck . That's too bad, because it is a wonderful state of mind to be experiencing. Have you ever heard a song playing and you instantly remembered an event that happened years before? Have you ever read a good book and were totally oblivious to someone asking you a question? Have you ever watched a movie and felt as if you were experiencing that which the actor was experiencing? Have you ever fallen in love? You have already experienced hypnosis. You and your lover have experienced it many times in your relationship and many times in your lives. You will hear all the instructions given. Whether I am giving you instructions in person or you are giving them to yourself or your lover, you will hear everything that goes on around you and everything that your partner is saying. The only time you won't hear everything that is being said is when you go physically to sleep. As you relax in hypnosis it is very easy to fall into natural sleep. In a few minutes, however, you will wake up on your own. You will, however, respond to any suggestion you gave yourself before falling into natural sleep. When you listen to a hypnotist or your own hypnotic recording, do not evaluate or judge what is going on. When you are listening to your partner hypnotizing your, do not analyze the process. There will be plenty of time to evaluate the process once you are back into the waking state of mind . Do not \"try\" to become hypnotized. The word \"try\" implies doubt. Just relax and let the process happen. You will really enjoy it. Your mind works better at accepting positive suggestions when your body is at rest and your mind is just listening to each and every word the hypnotist, your lover is saying. Listen to the words as you listened to parents when you were a child of five or six years of age. Remember that anything is possible when you are in the hypnotic state of mind."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Here are a list of FAQS or Frequently Asked Questions, regarding hypnosis and self-hypnosis.

She/he will be looking forward to the new day. Do not attempt to bring anyone back in time. Use a professional for that.

Your First Hypnosis Experience Together Procedure Here is what's going to happen. You, the reader of this book is going to hypnotize your partner. It's going to take place just before you go to bed at night to sleep. By now you have explained what you have learned so far. If your lover has any questions answer them to the best of your ability or refer him/her to my Hypnotism Website at: http://www.wayneperkins.net Next you are going to use what we call a progressive relaxation technique. This procedure will totally relax all the muscle groups in your lover's body. During this technique you will administer a hypnotic prescription. The prescription I give you will suggest that your lover will sleep soundly all night long and tomorrow morning will feel better than ever. If an emergency comes up during the night, your lover will awaken instantly and clear headed. He/she will be able to handle the emergency correctly and effectively. Time"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"This exercise in hypnosis will take about 20 minutes. For the first time you may want to allow around 40 minutes. The second time you hypnotize your partner cut the time in half to around 20 minutes. As your lover becomes sensitized to the process, the time of hypnotizing can be reduced even more. Mood The mood will be one of experimentation. Laugh , talk about your long term goals and dreams. Reassure each other that you will be gentle and give very positive suggestions that will assist you lover to achieve his/her goals. Instructions for Your First Hypnosis Session Together Do not tell anyone that you are going to work on problems with hypnosis. Other people's views and misconceptions of hypnosis will come into play if others are brought in to the process at this phase. Let yourself have many positive experiences with hypnosis to share with your friends at a later date. Your success is the most important issue here, not the validation of your friends or relatives. Your friends and relatives will never have the same motivation for your success than you and your lover. You are both in this process all by yourselves. Once you have numerous successes, then pass along your magic remedy. You will not only help your friends at that point, but you will reinforce the motivation that resulted in you going through the exercises in the first place. You will keep the experience fresh. Remember that since your mind will be very alert during this exercise, you will be able to react to any emergency that is going on around you. You may want to tape record your new experience. This way if you are on a business trip or too tired to administer the technique, your lover may listen to the tape. Practice this skill over and over. Repetition will help condition you faster. Let us begin! Begin by designating who is going to become the hypnotist for the evening. Since your goal is to have yourself or your lover sleep all night long as a result of the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"process, you don't want to go through the process and then wake him/her up so it can be your turn. For the first two weeks using Plan A, use the same designated hypnotist. This will allow the hypnotist to become conditioned to the process as well as your lover becoming conditioned to going deeper and deeper into this wonderful experience. When its time to change roles, both of you will be experienced and ready for success. Make sure as you read to your partner, the kids are asleep, the dogs put away, the phones set on mute or turned down and the television is off. You want to have all of your attention directed at this process and at your lover. Be within arm's reach of turning off the light so you both can make an easy transition to sleeping. Remember to put a tape into your recorder. Get a 90 minute one so you won't be distracted when the tape shuts off. Progressive Relaxation Technique #1 Let's use a progressive relaxation technique. Progressive relaxation techniques are easy to use. Many psychologists and psychiatrists, who don't want to scare anyone telling them they use hypnosis, use this wonderful technique. Let's begin! Every time you see (PAUSE), hold your silence around three seconds and then continue. The following induction script is what you say: Close your eyes and listen to my voice. (PAUSE) I am going to give you suggestions that will assist you in relaxing deeply all night long. Tomorrow, when you awaken, you will feel full of energy (PAUSE) Each time that we practice these techniques, you will find you are going deeper and deeper and enjoying the hypnotic experience more and more. (PAUSE) I am going to count slowly from five down to one. With every count I want you to take a long, slow deep breath. As you inhale, breathe in the refreshing air.

This was my first college audience with many psychology students and even a psychology professor in attendance. I was thinking how strange it is to mention hypnosis with these learned men and women. These learned men and women are fearful and think I have some strange powers over people, with the use of my eyes. Why do people have this prejudice about hypnotism and eyes? Eyes have always been a significant part of the hypnosis process. What is the connection the eyes and hypnosis? The sense of \"sight\" acts as a metaphor for hypnosis. At the count of three, look up from this book. Scan your eyes around the room, keeping a finger on your place in this book. Then focus your attention on one object on the other side of your room. Focus on this object for about ten seconds and then start reading the book again. All right, one, two, and three, look, scan and focus. Well, that was fun. Did you notice as you scan around your room all the different objects? Did you notice different textures, sizes, shapes, form, mass, and colors? As you focused on one object did you notice what happened? Other objects, shapes, sizes, form, mass, and colors go out of focus. They recede into the background. They don't seem quite as distinct or as important anymore. This experience, the experience of sight is just like hypnosis. With hypnosis you focus your attention so much on a central word, thought or idea that the rest of the world goes out of focus. You don't really notice or care that much about what else is going on around you. You know that people are talking or that things are happening but they aren't as important as the ideas your are concentrating on at the time. With hypnosis you don't need your eyes open at the beginning of the induction in order for it to work . Later in this chapter you will learn how to hypnotize yourself with an Eyes-Closed Induction. It will be fun! Objective of Chapter 4 The objective of Chapter 4 is to help you understand what to say to yourself during the hypnotic induction. This chapter will assist you in creating specific script to insert in the progressive relaxation induction. The script is designed to help your lover achieve his/her goals. What Do You Say During The Induction? What is an induction? What do you say during the induction? An induction is the formal ceremony with a goal to elicit a hypnotic response from the subject or"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"hypnotee. The subject or hypnotee may carry out the formal ceremony normally presented by a hypnotist. Hypnosis can and does exist even without the formal ceremony or induction. This concept is hard for people to understand. But it is true. Once you accept this teaching self-hypnosis will become powerful and it will be fun to use, especially when you get to the exercise in Chapter 7. The induction is a signal that hypnosis is coming . You had better get ready! This is when your belief system and your expectation of hypnosis come into clear focus. What do you say during the induction? Anything you wish! I will list the basic parts of a typical induction or ceremony, for you. This will include what you do and what you say to your lover. The procedures used in this book will be at night before both of you go to sleep. However, you can administer these suggestions at any time during the day. Instead of counting down during the end of the induction and telling your lover to sleep a the \"count of five,\" you will be telling your lover to awaken at the \"count of five.\" Tools For A Great Induction Pre-hypnotize your lover . What does he/she wish to accomplish during this session . Remember that you told your partner that he/she will \"relax deeply all night along and awaken tomorrow feeling full of energy,\" at the very beginning of the exercise in Chapter 3. This is called pre-hypnosis . Deep breathing suggestions : Tell your partner to breathe deeply to enhance the relaxation response. Imagination stimulation : Focus on relaxing your lover's muscle groups. If you wish to give your lover an induction without reading the book, you can cue yourself on what to say by just looking at his/her body. Look at her head, talk about relaxing the muscles of the head, face, and neck and continue down her body by looking at it. This makes it easy in case she doesn't want the light on while you read, or you wish to use a candle for a wonderful lighting effect. Post-hypnotic suggestion : Give your partner a suggestion during the induction that will predict and ask for a particular behavior, once she/he awakens from hypnosis. The behavior we are looking for in this book is the complete relaxation and stress reduction at night and the full awareness and high energy level during awakening. As you experiment on your own with your personal goals, you will develop many post-hypnotic suggestions. Awakening : Give your lover a signal to come out of hypnosis. It may be a count, such as from one to five. It may also be a set amount of time. For example, you may tell yourself that you will concentrate in hypnosis for twenty minutes and then awaken on your own, feeling wide-awake and alert. In the exercises in this book the cue is always, \"when you awaken tomorrow morning.\""},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"If your lover wants you to awaken before that time, use the time cue, in twenty minutes you will awaken, or a count, when I count form one to five you will awaken. By the time I reach the count of five you will wide, awake and alert just like you are in the morning after a long refreshing sleep. Why Do You Say it? Question: Why do we use pre-hypnosis? Answer: We use pre-hypnosis to remind ourselves of the precise behavior we want to change. If we fall into natural sleep during the induction, we will still accomplish our goal. Our pre-hypnosis will act as the hypnotic prescription or prevailing thought. Question: Why do we use an induction? Answer: We use an induct ion to get our mind ready for change. The induction is a formal ceremony devised to send a signal to your lover's subconscious mind that we are ready for change. Question: Why do I use deep breathing exercises? Answer: You can use deep breathing to give yo ur partner methods of relaxing you generally don't think about in the waking state. You also give your lover a method of getting feedback to your brain that the suggestions are taking effect. Question: Why do I want to stimulate my lover's imagination? Answer: You stimulate your lover's imagination because everything is possible in your imagination. Think about when you dream at night. You can fly, slay dragons or run faster than any human being. You can interact with people who have died several years before and you can be any age. Everything is possible in your imagination. Why not focus on all the possibilities? Question: Why do I use a post-hypnotic suggestion? Answer: You use a post-hypnotic suggestion as your main theme or reason for the session. Your lover carries out these suggestions after the hypnotic session is over. If his goal is to control your weight, then your post-hypnotic suggestion would involve words and ideas that will help him control weight. You may tell your lover to begin exercising or drinking water. If your goal of the session is to relax then your post-hypnotic suggestion will involve how you will feel"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"relaxed after the induction session. You may suggest feeling the same degree of relaxation while you are working on a project after the session is finished. What Is A Hypnotic Prescription? Question: What is a Hypnotic Prescription Answer: A hypnotic prescription is the script or verbiage that you use during the hypnotic ceremony or induction that centers on one or more of your lover's goals. This prescription may include a story or metaphor that helps explain a lesson that the subconscious mind understands and acts upon. The prescription is written in such a way that your subconscious mind will act upon it either during the hypnotic state or after the induction when the hypnotic experience is officially over (The posthypnotic state). The prescription can be very lengthy or administered in one well-chosen word. The prescription works best when repeated many times. The hypnotic prescription when administered goes into your lover's powerful subconscious mind. It changes his/her belief system from one of I can't to one that states, \"I can.\" Always Administer Positive Words and Ideas Question: Would you rather listen to something pos itive or something negative? Answer: Our brains are crammed full of negative ideas and scripts. How many movies have you seen with death, destruction, and loss of love and heartache? How many newscasts have you observed examples of mans' inhumanity towards man? How many times did we run those scripts in our minds when parents, relatives, or friends told us we would never amount to anything, or we should be grateful for what little we have?"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"These hypnotic Prescriptions (yes, they are hypnotic prescriptions) keep running in our head and may be affecting our behavior and our attitudes toward successful and healthy lives. People think themselves to life and they think themselves to death. How many people do you know with negative attitudes that also have poor health? Have you ever met a person with a negative attitude that is not achieving what they want to achieve in life? Do they put down and ridicule people that are successful? Do they act resentful to everyone and everything? You are going to learn how to be positive so you can overcome all of those negative attitudes and scripts. Since we already have enough negative scripts running in our brains, we need to load a pile of positive ones to our memory. We are so use to reacting to things negatively that I am going to show you specific examples of goals stated by my clients that needed to be changed from negative to positive before goals were achieved. Commit Your Goals to Paper Think of a few goals right now. Always keep your goals handy so you can refer to them at night. It's okay to think about them during the day as well. Always surround your thoughts about your goals and your lover's goals with total relaxation. This process will allow your subconscious mind and conscious mind to work in harmony. What Do You Say In A Prescription? What are the magic words that will help you achieve all of your goals? Where do I find the right things to say? How do I say them? Let's find out. In a prescription you say two basic things. You state a behavior you want to change or goal you wish to achieve during the session or after the session. You state it in a way that assumes you have already reached the goal or are rapidly getting closer to achieving it. In the case of relaxation, you may tell your partner something like this: \"Picture yourself relaxing. (PAUSE) See yourself relaxing. Feel yourself deeply relaxing and in control. (PAUSE) When you awaken from hypnosis you will be relaxed and in control. \""},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"P P a a r r t t 2 2 . .

William James, a great philosopher who was quoted near the end of the last century, said,\" The greatest discovery in my lifetime is that man can change his life, by changing his mind.\" It sounds too easy, doesn't it? But the fact is William Jame's statement is true. I remember high school graduation day. Who ever forgets that day? We were listening to our names being called. At my high school we graduated in order of class rank, We had the top three students give speeches and then the top 10 percent of the class followed by the remaining students in order of grade point average. Four-hundred and thirty-two students received diplomas. There was one student who ranked four-hundred thirty-two out of four-hundred and thirty-two. Let's call him \"John.\" I knew John from fourth grade on. I still know John, today, over thirty years later. As his class rank indicated, he never did well in school. He was a nice person and fun to be around but he was a poor students. When you think about it, can you imagine how John felt to receive his diploma last among his peers, teachers, parents and families on graduation night? A year later, John and I were drafted into the Army on the same day and spent basic training at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. After basic, we both shipped out to different destinations and I didn't see John until six years later. I was graduating from college with a Bachelors Degree in Business Education and there was John, graduating with honors, with Bachelors Degree In Computer Engineering."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"I just could not believe it. I talked to John after the ceremony. I asked him how he changed so much in just a few years. (I found out later that in college, John never received a grade lower than an A) He received A's in every single class! As I asked him how he changed so much, my mind quickly went back to the high school graduation that had to have been very humiliating for him. John said just four words , \" I changed my mind.\" The simple but powerful techniques in this book and my other books in the How To Hypnotize series, capitalize on the fact that you and your lover can make dramatic changes in your lives. Just keep in mind the great discovery an intellectual philosopher made at the turn of the last century and a poor high school student made sixty-five years later. You can change your life, by changing your mind. The following exercise is going to be fun. I am going to add a few more prescriptions to your nightly exercise to increase the possibilities for you and your lover. Are you ready to bring help your lover achieve personal goals and are you ready to achieve your own personal goals? Lets' begin! Procedure For this exercise, instead of hypnotizing your partner for two consecutive weeks, you are going to alternate roles as hypnotist and subject. You can alternate every other night or hypnotize for just a few consecutive nights followed by your lover hypnotizing you for a few consecutive nights. Whatever the both of you decide will be the correct interval By now you have the power of four working in your favor. Time This exercise in hypnosis will take about 20-30 minutes. For the first time you may want to allow around 40-50 minutes. The second time you hypnotize your partner cut the time in half to around 20 minutes. As your lover becomes sensitized to the process, the time of hypnotizing can be reduced even more."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Mood The mood will be one of experimentation. Laugh , talk about your long term goals and dreams. Reassure each other that you will be gentle and give very positive suggestions that will assist you lover to achieve his/her goals. Instructions for Plan B Alternating Your Hypnosis Sessions This is going to be fun! How are you both doing so far? Have both of you experienced hypnosis for a two-week period? Have you begun to fight over whose turn it is? I hope not. In any case this chapter will help because in Plan B, you are going to alternate roles has hypnotist/subject, every single night. You may continue your role for two or three consecutive sessions if you like. You have both been conditioned by now to fall into a deep state of hypnosis as you fall into natural sleep. Whatever intervals you both agree on will be the correct intervals. This exercise will work quite well now in that you both know how to deliver and receive hypnotic suggestions. Now its time to give and receive on an alternating basis. This way your experience will remain fresh and reinforcement for your personal suggestions and goals are always no more than one or two days away. You may want to tape record your new experience. This way if you are on a business trip or too tired to administer the technique, your lover may listen to the tape. Practice this skill over and over. Repetition will help condition you faster. Let us begin! Begin by designating who is going to become the hypnotist for the evening. Since your goal is to have yourself or your lover sleep all night long as a result of the process, you don't want to go through the process and then wake him/her up so it can be your turn. For the first two weeks using Plan A, use the same designated hypnotist. This will allow the hypnotist to become conditioned to the process as well as your"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"lover becoming conditioned to going deeper and deeper into this wonderful experience. When its time to change roles, both of you will be experienced and ready for success. Make sure as you read to your partner, the kids are asleep, the dogs put away, the phones set on mute or turned down and the television is off. You want to have all of your attention directed at this process and at your lover. Be within arm's reach of turning off the light so you both can make an easy transition to sleeping. Remember to put a tape into your recorder. Get a 90 minute one so you won't be distracted when the tape shuts off. Progressive Relaxation Technique #2.

In business, the 80/20 Rule states that 80% of the sales revenue are driven by only 20% of the customers. From business to business, whether large or small and across all industries, this business rule applies itself over and over again. How does the 80/20 Rule apply to hypnosis with your lover? Think about the exercises presented in this book, in which you and your lover participated. Does each partner read 50% of the time? Is one partner asked to read more often to the degree of 60%, 75%, 80% or more? If you are reading 50% of the time do you see a time where one partner may do the bulk of the reading? If you find yourself or your lover taking on the role of the hypnotist to a greater degree in your relationship, that is actually a good thing! I you are the one that is hypnotizing, reading, or \"giving\" most of the time, you are going to appreciate this theory. I have know many hypnotists over the last 30 years, and one thing that stands out in my mind is that all of the hypnotists I know and have ever known suffer from good health. Why good health? All day long, hypnotists and hypnotherapists are giving other people positive suggestions. These suggestions are usually relating to health in some way. Just asking the client to breathe deeply and push out any tension out of his lungs or his muscles is health restoring. Each day the hypnotist is asking his client to become healthier, wealthier, and wiser. What a great job! Now, you are the hypnotist. You are giving your lover powerful healthy suggestions.

In my book, How To Hypnotize Yourself Without Losing Your Mind, I stress the power of forgiveness.

Plan D is the best one because you get to pick your own hypnosis induction. I also call Plan D, the daily plan because you can change the induction every single day. Your lover can change his/her daily plan when hypnotizing you as well. As I state before in Chapter 1 and as I describe further in my first book, How To Hypnotize Yourself Without Losing Your Mind, a hypnotic induction is just a formal ceremony to get your conscious and subconscious minds alert that hypnosis is coming soon. It cues your brain to start working on the suggestions given with more concentration than you give in normal conversation. Does it really make a difference what words you are using during the formal induction \"ceremony?\" For over 20 years, I have developed a surefire technique to keep both lovers interested and focused on giving hypnotic inductions to each other. The method I use to give a great hypnotic induction before nighttime sleep is by reading stories. Think about it. Remember when you were a small child. Your Mother or Father or perhaps another caregiver would read you a story. Many times this was from a storybook with pictures, sometimes the books had no pictures and you would have to create pictures with your imagination. Remember the feelings you had while you were being read to your parents or caregivers? Did you feel safe? Did you feel secure? Did you feel loved? In working with clients over the past 20 years, I have found that even in abusive families, there was a time when a parent would read to the child and at that time the child felt safe. As we grow up, we want to feel independent and ask not to be read to anymore. We go through life looking for a safe, secure environment. We are looking for an environment filled with loved. What better way to find that kind of environment then to co-create that environment with our lover? You and your lover will be highly motivated to read bedtime stories to each other. As your lover is reading to you, a powerful subconscious mind will associate the reading with the reading by your parents or caregivers."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Your subconscious mind will bring back the feelings of security, safety and love. What a wonderful way to communicate with your lover! You may vary the stories each day. This way you have 365 different inductions at your convenience. Does this make sense to you? What Kinds of Stories Do I Read to My Lover? What kinds of stories do you read to your lover? Read the stories that your lover selects. Take a trip with you lover to bookstores or children's toy stores. Take your time and pick out books that you would read to your child. Usually children's books will have some kind of moral or lesson to teach. Those will be fine. If children's books aren't of interest to you, perhaps autobiographies of great people, stories from the Chicken Soup of the Soul series, or stories of miracles or people achieving success regardless of the odds they face. Stories of victory are great when they are the last information source to enter your brain. Too often, people will listen to the news before going to bed. They are bombarded by horrible events. These horrible events can trigger restless sleep and even nightmares. Find books that have a positive meaning to them. Your short-term memory won't always be activated as these stories are being read to you. However, the information will be stored in long-term memory and will effect your behavior in a positive way. Can I Include Hypnosis Prescriptions In These Stories? Yes, you can. You can insert the hypnotic prescription at the beginning of the story. You may also want to insert the same hypnotic prescription anywhere in the text that you are reading. One plan that I enjoy is to insert the prescription a the beginning of the story, then in the middle and if I hear that my lover's breathing has just shifted indicating a shift in awareness, then I will insert the hypnosis prescription there as well."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"You may want to insert a prescription at the end of each paragraph in the story. Regardless of where you place them, repetitions of the positive suggestions are necessary in order to create permanent change. You can keep the positive hypnotic prescriptions close to you as you read the book to your lover. That way it will be handy when you need to insert a suggestion or two. Plan D Exercise1. Read Me A Story. Instructions Have your lover pick out a story. Get your hypnosis prescription written down and close by your books. Make sure your tape recorder is turned on. This way if you are on a trip without your lover, she/he can achieve all of the benefits of your hypnosis induction as if you were in the room reading aloud. Before you begin, plan where you will insert the hypnosis prescriptions. I suggest that you begin by saying, \"While I am reading you this story, you will find all of your tension leaving your body. You are going to feel relaxed, safe, secure and deeply loved. All of the tension of the day is leaving your body and peaceful, relaxing feeling remain. Tomorrow when you awaken, you are going to feel fully alert and aware. You are going to feel better than you have ever felt before. You are going to feel relaxed, safe, and secure. You are going to feel deeply loved, all day long.\" Procedure Use this technique. If you find that your partner would rather listen to Progressive Relaxation Techniques 1 or 2, then go back and use those techniques. Whatever exercises you decide on using for yourself those will be the correct ones. Whatever exercises your lover wants you to use on her/him, those will be the correct ones. The only things that count are the results. Use the techniques you like the most and are giving you the best results."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Time By now your lover has been conditioned to go into a deep sleep in just a few minutes. You may only have to read for five or ten minutes. Some nights will take longer only because there is more stress to be released by your lover. Allow extra time for those nights. Mood The mood is one of a changing role. Think of yourself as a parent reading to a small child. In a sense you are. You will be stimulating your partner's associations with his/her childhood. This is the place where your lover's powerful subconscious mind is living. Visit it often. Plan D. Exercise #3. Read Me A Story Now with story in hand, begin to read the text of the story. Keep watch over your lover and notice the physical changes as your lover goes to sleep. Think about how enjoyable these nights and these precious moments have become. Your relationship is moving in a positive direction. Do you feel it moving that way? Now is the time that you can let your friends in on your experiment. As you tell them about your new techniques in relationship building, think of all of the enjoyable times you are spending together. Continue on with the exercises in this book. You may even want to invent some of your own. Feel free to share with me your wonderful experiences. Tell me of your triumphs using these technique or new ones that you invented.
