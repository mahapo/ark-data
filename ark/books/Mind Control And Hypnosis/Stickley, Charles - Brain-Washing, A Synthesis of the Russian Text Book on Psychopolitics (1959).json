'Conservatives', fearing a loss ofcredibility by distributing It, limited itscirculation.Evidence that psychopol it ics was thenoperative was minimal, but the handwritingwas on the wall. Its future was being secu-red by a cadre of adepts who had long beforecaptured the citadels of learning,and wereassiduously developing support systems forthe Intended assault on the American mind,and training the troops to nan the assault.The extent of their success can be meas-uredtoday. itIs evident in the trust thepeople place in 'leaders', in naive disre-gard of the evidence that that trust is notwarranted. The almost total nonresistanceto official implementation of a system ofmanagement and control, in defiance of lawand tradition, is another indicator. Alteredperceptions of values, morality, responsibi-lity, loyalty-all the standards by whichintegrity is measured- starkly proclaim thevalidity of the use of psychopolitics, asdocumented in these pages.The existence of the systematic use ofpsychopolitics has a direct relation to ageopolitical war which was declared againstestablished institutions many years ago. Ne-ver publicly acknowledged as an integratedmovement, the record shows that activists inthe fabian/socialist/communist left presenta united front against traditional forms ofsocial organization. In time of need, theyopenly identify with each others causes.Probably the earliest visible warningof the use of psychopolitics as a condition-ing tool occurred during world war two, whenthoughtful people found it Inexplicable thatthe excesses of the Nazis were (justifiably)excoriated, while the equally vile Soviet a-trocities were not.After the war, the coddling of radicalcollaborators in high government positions,in contrast to the treatment of those whoseduty it was to uncover them, is a classicexample of mass conditioning of the mind.In the 1950s, penetration of the publicschools became visible. Radical departuresfrom traditional subjects and methods spark-ed reaction from the citizenry.

It wasthis conflict which finally brought recog-nition that there was an \"invisible\" layerof government which was not acting by theconsent of the governed, but was, in fact,autocratically denying the right of dissent.Years passea, before it became evidentthat this war was geopolitical-involvingthe great globe Itself, and all who lived.Still more years, before there was documen-ted evidence that psychopolitics was an in-tegral element of official policy, determi-ned by the \"invisible government\".During world war two, military expertsrecognized that a tenth principle of warfarehad been added to the nine historic strate-gies by which wars had been waged in pastconflicts. That tenth principle Is impli-cit in the precept that \"supreme excellencein warfare consists of winning in advanceof perceptible hostilities\", and the expertsidentified it as \"paralysis of the will toresist\".Psychopolitics, as delineated in thispamphlet, is the embodiment of the tenthprinciple of warfare, activated against theAmerican peopleby,among others, officialson the public payroll, working In the roleof 'public servant'.Those who recognize the extent of thepenetration of the American mind, by use ofthe strategies of psychopolitics, may wellwonder if it is not too late.

This is true of every tribe andstate in the history of Man. Today, Russian cul-ture has evolved more certain and definite methodsof aligning and securing the loyalties of personsand populaces, and of enforcing obedience uponthem. This modern 'outgrowth of old practice iscalled Psychopolitics.The stupidity and narrowness of nations notblessed with Russian reasoning has caused themto rely upon practices which are, today, too an-cient and outmoded for the rapid and heroic paceof our time. And in view of the tremendous ad-vance of Russian Culture in the field of mentaltechnologies, begun with the glorious work of Pav-lov, and carried forward so ably by later Russians,it would be strange that an art and science wouldnot evolve totally devoted to the aligning of loyal.ties and extracting the obedience of individuals andmultitudes.Thus we see that psychopolitical proceduresare a natural outgrowth of practices as old as Man,practices which are current in every group of menthroughout the world. Thus, in psychopoliticalprocedures there is no ethical problem, since it isobvious and evident that Man is always coercedagainst his will to the greater good of the State,whether by economic gains or indoctrination intothe. wishes and desires of the State.-13-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Basically, Man is an animal.

Man isa collective animal, grouped together for his ownprotection before the threat of the environment.Those who so group and control him must thenhave in their possession specialized techniques todirect the vagaries and energies of the animal Mantoward greater efficiency in the accomplishment ofthe goals of the State.Psychopolitics, in -one form or another, havelong been used in Russia, but the subject is all butunknown outside of the borders of our nation, saveonly where we have carefully transplanted our in-formation and where it is used for the greater goodof the nation.The definition of Psychopolitics follows.Psychopolitics is the art and science of assert-ing and maintaining dominion over the thoughtsand loyalties of individuals, officers, bureau§, andmasses, and the effecting of the conquest of enemynations through \"mental healing.\"The subject of Psychopolitics breaks down intoseveral catagories. each a natural and logical pro-ceeding from the last.

Thus we see that man, himself,is already a political organism, even if we do notconsider a mass of men.Sickness could be considered to be a disloyaltyto the remaining organisms on the part of one or-ganism. This disloyalty becoming apparent, bringsaboutarevolt of some part of the anatomy againstthe remaining whole, and thus we have in effect,an internal revolution. The heart, becoming dis-affected, falls away from close membership andservice to the remainder of the organism, and wediscover the entire body in all of its activities isdisrupted because of the revolutionary activityof the heart. The heart is in revolt becanse it can-not or will not cooperate with the remainder of thebody.If we permit the heart thus to revolt, thekidneys, taking the example of the heart, mayintheir turn rebel and cease to work for the good tof the organism. This rebellion, multiplying toother organs and the glandular system, brings aboutthe death of the \"individual.\" We can see withease that the revolt is death, that the revolt of anypart of the organism results in death. Thus wesee that there can be no compromise with rebellion.Like the \"individual\" man, the State is a col-lection of aggregations. The political entities with-in the State must, all of them, cooperate for thegreater good of the State lest the State itself fallasunder and die, for with the disaffection of anysingle distrust we discover, at length, the entireState falling. This is the danger of revolution.-15-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Look at Earth. We see here one entire organ-ism. The organism of Earth'is an individualexganism.Earth has as its organs the variousraces and nations of men. Where one of these ispermitted to remain disaffected, Earth itself isthreatened with death. The threatened rebellion ofone country, no matter how small, against the totalorganism of Earth, would find Earth sick, and thecultural state of man to suffer' inconsequence.Thus, the putrescent illness of Capitalist States,spreading their pus and bacteria into the healthycountries of the world would not do otherwise thanbring about the death of Earth, unless these illorganisms are brought into loyalty and obedienceand made to function for the greater good of theworld-wide State.The constitution of Man is so composed thatthe individual cannot function efficiently withoutthe alignment of each and every part and organof his anatomy. As the average individual is in-capable, in an unformed and uncultured state, aswitness the barbarians of the jungle, so must hebe trained into a coordination of his organic func-tions by exercise, education, and work. He mustbe made to realize this, for only then can he bemade to function efficiently in the role assigned tohim.The tenets of rugged individualism, personaldeterminism, self-will, imagination, and personalcreativeness are alike in the masses antipathetic tothe good of the Greater State. These willful andunaligned forces are no more than illnesses whichwill bring about disaffection, disunity, and atlength the collapse of the group to which the in-dividual is attached.The constitution of Man lends itself easily andthoroughly to certain and positive regulation fromwithout of all its functions, includin those ofthingness, obedience, and loyalty, and these thingsmust be controlled if a greater State is to ensue.While it may seem desirable to the surgeonto amputate one or another limb or organ in orderto save the remainder, it must be pointed out thatthis expediency is not entirely possible of accom-plishment where one considers entire nations. Abody deprived of organs can be observed to belessened in its effectiveness. The world deprivedof the workers now enslaved by the insane and non-sensical idiocies of the Capitalists and Monarchs ofEarth, would if removed, create a certain disabilityin the world-wide State. Just as we see the victorforced to rehabilitate the population of a conqueredcountry at the end of a war, thus any effort toDEPOPULATE a disaffected portion of the worldmight have some consequence. However, let us"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"consider the inroad of virus and bacteria hostileto the organism, and we see that unless we canconquer the germ, the organ or organism whichit is attacking will, itself, suffer.In any State we have certain individuals whooperate in the role of the virus and germ, andthese, attacking the population or any group with-in the population, produce, by their self-willedI,greed, a sickness in the organ, which then generallyspreads to the whole.The constitution of Man as an individual body,or the constitution of a State o- a portion of theState as a political organism are analogous. It isthe mission of Psychopolitics first to align theobedience and goals of the group, and then main-tain their allignment by the eradication of the ef-fectiveness of the persons and personalities whichmight swerve the group toward disaffection. Inour nation, where things are better managed andwhere reason reigns above all else, it is not diffi-cult to eradicate the selfwilled bacteria which mightattack one of our political entities. But in the fieldof conquest, in nations less enlightened, where theRussian State does not yet have powgr, it is not asfeasible to remove the entire self-willed individual.Psychopolitics makes it possible to remove that partof his personality which,initself, is making havocwith the person's own constitution as well as thegroup with which the person is connected.If the animal man were permitted to continuesundisturbed by counter-revolutionary propaganda,if he were left to work under the well-planned lmanagement of the State, we would discover little{sickness amongst Man, and we would discover nosickness in the State. But where the individual is 4troubled by conflicting propaganda, where he isFmade the effect of revolutionary activities, wherehe is permitted to think thoughts critical of the,State itself, where he is permitted to question of Ithose in whose natural charge he falls, we would'discover his constitution to suffer. We would dis-cover, from this disaffection, the additional dis-affection of his heart and of other portions of hisanatomy.So certain is this principle that whenone finds a sick individual, could one search deep-ly enough, he would discover a mis-aligned loyaltysand an interrupted obedience to that person's groupunit.\trtThere are those who foolishly have embarkedsupon some spiritual Alice-in-Wonderland voyageinto what they call the \"subconscious\" or the \"un-conscious\" mind, and who, under the guise of \"psy-chotherapy\" would seek to make well the disaffecttion o= body organs, but it is to be noted that theirresults are singularly lacking in success. There is"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"no strength in such an approach. When hypnotismwas first invented in Russia it was observed thatall that was necessary was to command the un-resisting individual to be well in order, manytimes, to accomplish that fact. The limitation ofhypnotism has had to be improved upon in orderto increase the suggestibility of individuals whowould not otherwise be reached. Thus, any nationhas had the experience of growing well again, asa whole organism, when placing sufficient forcein play against a disaffected group.Just as inhypnotism any organ can be commanded into great-er loyalty and obedience, so can any political groupbe commanded into greater loyalty and obedienceshould sufficient force be employed.However,force often 'brings about destruction and it is oc-casionally not feasible to use broad mass force toaccomplish the ends in view. Thus, it is necessaryto align the individual against his desire not toconform.Just as it is a recognized truth that Man mustconform, to his environment,, so it is a recognizedtruth, and will become more.so as the years pro-ceed, that even the body of Man can be command-ed into health.The constitution of Man renders itself peculiar-1y adapted to re-alignment of loyalties.Wherethese loyalties to the 'petit bourgeoisie,' the Capi-talist, to anti-Russian ideas, we find the individualbody peculiarly susceptible to sickness, and thuswe can clearly understand the epidemics, illnesses,mass-neuroses, tumults, and confusions of theUnited States and other Capitalist counties.

Without food, the individ-ual dies.Without clothing, he freezes. Withouthouses and weapons, he is prey to the starvingwolves. The acquisition of sufficient items to an-swer those necessities of food, clothing, and shel-ter, in reason, is the natural right of a member ofan enlightened State.An excess of such itemsbrings about unrest and disquiet. The presence ofLuxury items and materials and the artificial crea-tion and whetting of appetites, as in Capitalistadvertising, are certain to accentuate the less-de-sirable characteristics of Man.The individual is an economic organism, in thathe requires a certain amount of food, a certainamount of water, and must hold within himself acertain amount of heat in order to live When hehas more than he can eat, more clothing than heneeds to protect him, he then enters upon a certainidleness which dulls his wits and awareness, andmakes him prey to difficulties Which, in a less toxicstate, he would have foreseen and' avoided. Thus,we have a glut being a menace to the individual.It is no less different in a group. Where thegroup acquires too much, its awareness of its ownfellows and of the environment is accordingly re-duced, and the effectiveness of the group in generalis lost.The maintaining of a balance between gluttonyand need is the province of Economics proper, andis the fit subject and concern of the CommunistState.Desire and want. are a state of mind. Individ-uals can be educated into desiring and wantingmore than they can ever possibly obtain, and suchindividuals are unhappy.Most of the self-willedcharacteristics of the Capitalists come entirelyfrom greed.He exploits the worker far beyondany necessity on his own part, as a Capitalist, toneed."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Ina nation where economic balances are notcontrolled, the appetite of the individual is undulywhetted by enchanting the fanciful persuasions todesire, and a type of insanity ensues, where eachindividual is persuaded to possess more than hecan use, and to possess it even at the expense of hisfellows.There is, in economic balances, the other side.The great and too long privation can bring aboutunhealthy desires, which, in themselves, accumu-late if left alone, more than the individual can use.Poverty, itself, as carefully cultivated in Capital-tistic States, can bring about an imbalance of ac-quisition. Just as a vacuum will pull into it mass-es, in a country where enforced privation upon themasses is permitted, and where desire is artificallywhetted, need turns to greed, and one easily dis-covers in such states exploitation of the many forthe benefit of the few.If one, by the technologies of Psychopolitics,were to dull this excessive greed in the few whopossess it, the worker would be freed to seek amore natural balance.cHere we have two extremes.Either one ofthem are an insanity. If we wish to create an in-sanity we need only glut or deprive an individualat long length beyond the ability to withstand andwe have a mental imbalance.A simple exampleof this is the alternation of too low. with too highpressures in a chamber, an excellent psycho oliti-al procedure.

Such suc-cess as the Income Tax law, had it been followedthoroughly, could have brought the United Statesand not Russia into the world scene as the firstCommunist nation. But the virility and good senseof the Russian peoples won.It may not be thatthe United States will become entirely Communistuntil past the middle of the century, but when itdoes it will be because of our superior understand-ing of economics and of psychopolitics.The Communist agent skilled-in economics hasas his task the suborning of tax agencies and theirpersonnel to create the maximum disturbance andchaos and the passing of laws adapted to our pur-poses and to him we must leave this task.Thepsychopolitical operator plays a distinctly differentrole in this drftma.The rich, the skilled in finance, the well inform-ed in government, are particular and individualtargets for the psychopolitician.

Life is a con-tinuous escape.Without force and threat therecan be no striving. Without pain there can be noescape from pain.Without the threat of punish-ment there can be no gain. Without rigorous andforthright control, there can be no accomplishedgoals for the State.Goals of the State should be formulated by theState for the obedience and concurrence of the in-dividuals within that State. A state without goalsso formulated is a sick State.A State withoutthe power and forthright wish to enforce its goalsis a sick State.When an order is issued by the CommunistState, and is not obeyed, a sickness will be dis-covered to ensue.Where obedience fails, themasses suffer..22-"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"State goals depend upon loyalty and obediencefor their accomplishment. When one discovers aState goal to be-interpreted, one discovers inevi-tably that there has been an interposition of self-willedness, of greed, of idleness, or of rugged in-dividualism and self-centered initiative. The in-terruption of a State goal will be discovered ashaving been interrupted by a person whose dis-loyalty and disobedience is the direct result of hisown mis-alignment with life.It is not always necessary to remove the in-dividual. It is possible to remove his self-willedtendencies to the improvement of the goals andgains of the whole. The technologies of Psycho-politics are graduated upon the scale which startssomewhat above the removal of the individual him-self, upward towardtheremoval only of thosetendencies which bring about his lack of coopera-tion.It is not enough for the State to have goals.These goals, once put forward, depend for theircompletion upon the loyalty and obedience of theworkers.Thesesengaged for the most part in hard labors,have little time for idle speculation, which is good.But, above them, unfortunately, there must be fore-menofone or another position, any one of whommight have sufficient idleness and lack of physicaloccupgtion to cause some disaffecting independen-cy in his conduct and behaviour.Psychopolitics remedies this tendency towarddisaffection when it exceeds the common persu-asions of the immediate superiors of the personin question.CHAPTERVANEXAMINATION OF LOYALTIESIf loyalty issoimportant in the economic andsocial structure, it is necessary to examine it furtheras itself.In the field of psychopolitics, loyalty meanssimply alignment. It means, more fully, alignmentwith the goals of the Communist State. Disloyaltymeans entirely mis-alignment, and more broadly,mis-alignment with the goals of the CommunistState.When we consider that the goals of the Com-munist State are to the best possible benefit of themasses, we can see that disloyalty, as a term, canembrace Democratic alignment. Loyalty to personsnot communistically indoctrinated would be quiteplainly a mis-alignment.-23-"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The cure of disloyalty is entirely contained inthe principles of alignment.All that it is neces-sary to do, where disloyalty is encountered, is toalign the purposes of the individual toward thegoals of Communism, and it will be discovered thatagreat many circumstances hitherto distas~eful inhis existence will cease to exist.A heart, or a kidney in rebellion against theremainder of the organism is being disloyal to theremainder of the organism. To cure that heartor kidney it is actually only necessary to bring itsactivities into alignment with the remainder of thebody.The technologies of Psychopolitics adequatelydemonstrate the workability of this.Mild shockof the electric variety can, and does, produce there-cooperation of a rebellious body organ.It isthe shock and punishment of surgery which, in themain, acco aplishes the re-alignment of a disaffect-ed portion of the body, rather than the surgeryitself.It is the bombardment of X-Rays, ratherthan the therapeutic value of X-Rays which causessome disaffected organ to once again turn its atten-tion to the support of the general organism.While it is not borne out that electric shockhas any therapeutic value, so far as making theindividual more sane, it is adequately brought outthat its PUNISHMENT VALUE will create in thepatient a greater cooperative attitude.The changing of loyalty consists, in its primarystep, of the eradication of existing loyalties. Thiscan be done in one of two ways. First, by demon-strating that previously existing loyalties havebrought about perilous physical circumstances,such as imprisonment, lack of recognition, duress,ofprivation, and second, by eradicating the per-sonality itself.The first is accomplished by a steady and con-tinuous indoctrination of the individual in the be-lief that his previous loyalties have been grantedto an unworthy source.One of the primary in-stances in this is creating circumstances whioh ap-parently derive from the target of his loyalties, soas to rebuff the individual. As part of this thereis the creation of a state of mind in the individual,by actually placing him under duress, and thenfurnishing him with false evidence to demonstratethat the target of his previous loyaltiesis,itself, thesource of the duress. Another portion of this samemethod consists of defaming or degrading the in-dividual whose loyalties are to be changed to thetarget of his loyalties,i.e., superiors or government,to such a degree that this target, at length, actuallydoes hold the individual in disrepute, and so doesrebuff him and serve to convince him that his loyal--24"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"ties have been misplaced.These are the mildermethods, but have proven extremely effective. Thegreatest drawback in their practice is that they re-quire time and concentration, the manufacture offalse evidence, and a psychopolitical operator'stime.In moments of expediency, of which there aremany, the personality itself can be rearranged byshock, surgery, duress, privation, and in particular,that best of psychopolitical techniques, implanta-tion, with the technologies of neo-hypnotism. Suchduress must have in its first part defamation of theloyalties, and in its second, the implantation of newloyalties. A good and experienced psychopoliticaloperator, working under the most favorable cir-cumstances, can, by the use of psychopoliticaltechnologies, alter the loyalties of an individual sodeftly that hisOWN COMPANIONSwill not sus-pect that they have changed.This, however, re-quires considerably more finesse than is usuallynecessary to the situation.MASS NEO-HYFNO-TISM can accomplish more or less the same resultswhen guided by an experienced psychopoliticaloperator. An end goal insucha procedure wouldbe the alteration of the loyalties of an ENTIRENATION in a short period of time by mass neo-hypnotism, a thing which has been effectivelyACCOMPLISHED among the LESS-USABLE statesof Russia.It is adequately demonstrated that loyalty isentirely lacking in that mythical commodity knownas `spiritual quality.' Loyalty is entirely a thingof dependence, economic or mental, and can hechanged by the crudest implantations.Observa.tion of workers' in their factories or fields demon-strates that they easily grant loyalty to a foremanor a woman, and then as easily abandon it and sub-stitute another individual, revulsing, at the sametime, toward the person to whom loyalty was pri-marily granted. The queasy insecurity of the mass-es in Capitalistic nations finds this more commonthan in an enlightened State such as Russia.InCapitalistic states, dependencies are so craven,wants and privations are so exaggerated, that loyal-ty is entirely without ethical foundation and existsonly in the realm of dependency, duress, or de-mand.It is fortunate that Communism so trulyap-proaches an ideal state of mind, for this brings acertain easiness into any changing of loyalties,since all other philosophies extant and practicedon Earth today are degrading and debased, com-pared to Communism.It is then with a certainsecurity that a psychopolitical operator functions,for he knows that he can change the loyalty of an"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"individual to a mo-e ideallevelby reason alone,and only expediency makes it necessary to employthe various shifts of psychopolitical technology.Any man who cannot be persuaded into Commun-ist rationale is, of course, to be regarded as some-what less than sane and it is, therefore, completelyjustified to use the techniquesofinsanity uponthenon-Communist.In order to change loyalty it is necessary toestablish first the existing loyalties of theindivid-ual. hetask is made very simple inviewof thefact that Capitalistic and Fascistic nations have nogreat security in theloyalty oftheir subjects.Andit may be found that the loyalties of the subjects,as we call any person against whom psychopoliticaltechnology is to be exerted, are already too faintto requireeradication. Itisgenerallyonly neces-sary to persuade with the rationale and over-whelm.ing reasonability of Communism to have the persongrant his loyalty to the Russian State. However.regulated only by the importance of the subject,no great amount of time shoul.l be expended uponthe individual, but emotional duress, or electricshock, or brain surgery s'hou;d be resorted to,should Communist propaganda persuasion fail. Ina case of a very importantt persan,it may be neces-sary to utilize the moredelicate technologies ofPsychopolitics so as to place the person himself,and his associates, in ignorance of the operation.In this case a simple implantation is used, with amaximum duress and command value.Only themost skilled psychopolitical operator should be em-ployed on such a project, as in this case of thevery important person, for a bungling might dis-close the tampering with his mental processes. Itis much more highly recommended, if there is anydoubt whatever about the success of an operationagainst an important person, to select out as a pay-chopolitical target persons in his vicinity in whomhe is emotionally involved. His wife or childrennormally furnish the best targets, and these can beoperated against without restraint. In securing theloyalty of a very important person one must placeat his side a constant pleader who enters a sexualof familiar chord into the situation on the side ofCommunism. It may not be necessary to make aCommunist out of the wife, or the children,oroneof the children, but it might prove efficacious todo so.In most instances, however, this is notpossible.By the use of various drugs, it is, inthis modern age, and well within the realm ofpsychopolitical reality, entirely too easy to bringabout a state of severe neurosis or insanity in thewife or children and thus pass them, with full con-sent of the important person, and the governmentin which he exists, or the bureau in which he is"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"operating, into the hands of a psychopolitical oper-ator, who then in his own laboratory, without re-straint or fear of investigation or censor, can,WITH ELECTRIC SHOCK,surgery, SEXUALATTACK, drugs, or other useft,l means, degradeor entirely alter the personalityti a family mem-ber, and create in that person a psychopoliticalslave subject, who, then, on command or signal, willperform OUTRAGEOUS ACTIONS,-thus discredit-ing the important persons, or will demand, on amore delicate level, that certain measures be takenby the important person, which measures are, ofcourse, dictated by the psychopolitical operator.Usually when the party has no real interestinthe activities or decisions of the important per-son, but merely wishes to remove him from effec-tive action, the attention of the pspchopoliticaloperator need 'not be so intense, and the personneed only be passed into the hands of some un-witting mental practitioner, who taught as he is bypsychopolitical operators,willbring about suffi-cient embarrassment.When the loyalty of an individual cannot beswerved, and where the opinion, weight, or effec-tiveness of the individual stands firmly in the roadof Communist goals, it is usually best to occasiona mild neurosis in the person by any availablemeans, and then, having carefully given him 'ahistory of mental imbalance, to see to it that hedisposes of himself bsuicide.Psychopolitical,operators have handled such situations skillfullytens of thousands of times and without Russia.It is a firm principle of Psychopolitics that•the person to be destroyed must be involved at firstor second hand in the stigma of insanity, and musthave been placed in contact with psychopoliticaloperators or persons trained by them, with a maxi-mum amount of turmult and publicity. The stigmaof insanity is properly placed at. the door of suchpersons' reputations and is -held there firmly bybringing about irrational acts, either on his ownpart or in his vicinity. Such an activity can beclassified as a partial destruction of alignment, andif this destruction is carried forward to its further-est extent the mis-alignment on new loyalties canbe embanked upon safely.By bringing about in-sanity or suicide on the part of the wife of animportant political personage, a sufficient mis-alignment has been instigated to change his atti-tude. And this, carried forward firmly, or assistedby psychopolitical implantation can begin the re-building of his loyalties, but now slanted in a moreproper and fitting direction.-27-"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Anotherreasonfor the alignment of psycho-political activities with the mis-alignment of in-sanity is that insanity, itself, is a despised and dis-graced state, and anything connected with it islightly viewed.Thus, a psychopolitical operator,working in the vicinity of an insane person, canrefute and disprove any accusations made againsthimbydemostrating that the family itself is taint.ed with mental imbalance.This is surprisinglyeffective in Capitalistic countries where insanityis so thorougily feared that no one would dreamof investigating any circumstances in its vicinity.Psvchopolitical propaganda works constantly andmust work constantly to increase and build up thisaura of mystery surrounding insanity, and mustemphasize the horribleness and hopelessness of in-sanity in order to excuse non-therapeutic actionstaken against the insane.Particularly in Capital.istic countries,an insane person has no rights underlaw.No person who is insane may hold property.No person who is insane may testify. Thus, wehave an excellent road along which we can traveltoward our certain goal and destiny.Entirely by bringing about public convictionthat the sanityofa person is in question, it is pos-sible to discount and e-adicate all of the goals andacitvities of that person.By demonstrating theinsanity of a group, or even a government, it ispossible, then, to cause its people to disavow it.By magnifying the general human reaction to in-sanity, through keeping the subject of insanity,itself, forever before thepubliceye, and then, byutilizing this reaction by causing a revolution onthe part of a populace against its leader or leaders,it is possible to stop any government or movement.It is important to know that, the entire subjectof loyalty is thus as easily hanled as it is. Oneof the first and foremost missions of the psycho-politician is to make an attack upon Communismand insanity synonymous.It should become thedefinitionof insanity, of the paranoid variety, that\"aparanoid believes he is being attacked by Com-munists.\"Thus, at once the support of the in•dividualso attacking Communism will fall away-and wither.Insteadofexecuting national leaders, suicidefor them should be arranged under circumstanceswhich question their demise.In this way we canselect out all opposition to the Communist exten-sion into thesocialorders of the world, and renderpopulaces who would oppose us leaderless, andbring -about a state of chaos or misalignment intowhich we can thrust, with great simplicity, theclear and forceful doctrinesofCommunism.-20-"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The cleverness of our attack in this field ofPsychopolitics is adequate to avoid the understand-ing of the layman and the usual stupid official, andby operating entirely under the banner of author-ity, with the oft-repeated statement that the prin-ciples of psychotherapy aretoodevious for com-mon understanding, an entire revolution can beeffected without the suspicion of a populace untilit is an accomplished fact.An insanityisthe maximum mis-alignment, itcan be grasped to be the maximum weapon in:severance of loyalties to leaders and old socialorders.

But one need not count upon this act offaith to bring about a broadbelief.One mustonly exhibit ENOUGH FORCE,ENOUGH IN-HUMANITY, ENOUGH BRUTALITY AND SAV-AGENESS to create implicit belief and thereforeand thereby obedience.As Communism is a mat-ter of belief, its study is a STUDY OF FORCE.The earliest Russian psychiatrists, pioneeringthis science of psychiatry, understood thoroughlythat 'hypnosis is induced BY ACUTE FEAR.Theydiscovered it could also be induced BY SHOCKOF AN EMOTIONAL NATURE, AND ALSO BYEXTREME PRIVATION,AS WELL AS BYBLOWS AND DRUGS.In order to induce a high state of hypogneyin an individual,agroup, orapopulation, anelement of terror MUST ALWAYS BE PRESENTon the part of those who would govern.THEPSYCHIATRIST IS APTLY SUITED TO THISROLE, FOR HIS BRUTALITIES ARE COMMIT.TED IN THE NAME OF' SCIENCE and are in-explicably complex, and entirely out of view ofthe human understanding.A sufficient popularterror of the psychiatrist will, in itself, bring aboutinsanity on the part of many individuals.

Onlyin' this way can the absolute judgment of the psy-chopolitical operative as to the sanity or insanityofpublic figures be maintained in complete belief.Using sufficient brutality upon their patients, thepublic at large will come to believe utterly any-thing they say about their patients.Furthermore,and much more important, the field of the mindmust be sufficiently dominated by the psychopoli-tical operative so that wherever tenets of the mindare taught they will be hypnotically believed.

His entirereasoning capabilities, even his ethics and morals,depend upon stimulus-response machinery.Thishas long 'been demonstrated by such Russians asPavlov, and the principles have long been usedin handling the recalcitrant, in training children,and in bringing about the state of optimum be-haviour on the part of a population.Having no independent will of his own, Manis easily handled by stimulus-response mechanisms.It is only necessary to install a stimulus into themental anatomy of Man to have that stimulus re-active and respond any time an exterior commandsource call it into being.- 37-"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The mechanisms of stimulus-response are easilyunderstood.The body takes pictures of everyaction in the environment around an individual.When the environment includes brutality, terror,shock, and other such activities, the mental imagepicture gained contains in itself, all the ingredientsof the environment. If the individual, himself, wasinjured during that moment, the injury, itself, willmanifest when called upon to respond by an ex-terior command source.As an example of this, if an individual is beat-en, and is told during the entireity of the beatingthat he must obey certain officials, he will, in thefuture, feel the beginnings of the pain the momenthe begins to disobey. The installed pain, itself,reacts as a policeman, for the experience of theindividual demonstrates to him that he cannotcombat, and will receive pain from certain officials.The mind can become very complex in itsstimulur responses.As easily demonstrated inHYPNOTISMan entire chain of commands, having to do with a great many complex actions, canhe beaten, shocked, or terrorized into a mind, andwill there lie dormant until called into view bysome similarity in the circumstances of the en-vironment to the incident of punishment.The behaviour of children is regulated in thisfashion in every civilized country.The father,finding himself unable to bring about immediateobedience and training on the part of his child,resorts to physical violence, and after administer-ing punishment of a physical nature to the childon several occasions, is gratified to experiencecomplete obedience on the part of the child eachtime the father speaks.In that parents are wontto be lenient with their children, they seldomadminister sufficient punishment to bring aboutentirely optimum obedience.The ability of theorganism to withstand punishment is very great.Complete and implicit response can be gainedonly by stimuli sufficiently brutal to actually injarethe organism.The Kossack method of breakingwild horses is a useful example.The horse willnot reetrain i'\"elf or take any of its rider's com-mands.The rider. wishing to break it, mounts,and takes a flask of strong vodka, and smashes itbetween the horse's ears. The horse, struck to itsknees, its eves filled with alcohol, mistaking. thedampness' for blood, instantly and thereafter givesits attention to the rider and never needs furtherbreaking.Difficulty in breaking horses is onlyo^easinned when light punishments are administer-ed.There is some mawkish sentimentality about\"breaking the spirit,\" but what is desired 'here isan obedient horse, and sufficient brutality bringsabout an obedient horse.-38----"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The stimulus-response mechanisms of the bodyare such that thepainand the command subdivideso as to counter each other. The mental imagepicture of the punishment will not become effectiveupon the individual unless the command contentis disobeyed. It is pointed out in many Russianwritings that this is a survival mechanism. It hasalready been well and thoroughly used in the sur-vival of Communism.It is only necessary to deliver into the organisma sufficient stimulus to gain an adequate response.So long as the organism obeys the stimulus when-ever it is restimulated in the future, it does notsuffer from the pain of the stimulus. But shouldit disobey the command content of the stimulus,the stimulus reacts to punish the individual. Thus,we have an optimum circumstance, and one of thebasic principles of P,vchopolitics. A sufficientlyinstalled stimulus will thereafter remain as a policemee'hanism within the individual to cause him tofollow the commands and directions given to him.Should he fail to follow these commands and direc-tions, the stimulus mechanism will go into action.As the commands are there with the moment ofduress, the commands themselves need never berepeated, and if the individual were to departTHOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY from the psycho-politician, he will still obey the psychopolitician,or, himself, become extremely ill and in agony.These principles, built from the earliest days ofPavlov, by constant and continuous Russian de-vc lopment, have, at last, become of enormous useto us in our conquest. For less modern and well-informed countries of Earth, lacking this mechan.ism, failing to understand it, and coaxed into som-nolence by our own psychopolitical operatives, whodiscount and disclaim it, cannot avoid succumbingto it.The body is less able to resist a stimulus if ithas insufficient FOOD AND IS WEARY. The-e-fore, it is necessary to administer all such stimulito individuals when their ability to resist has beenreduced by privation and exhaustion. Refusal tolet them sleep over many days, denying them ade-quate food, then brings about an optimum state forthe receipt of a stimulus, and if the person is thengiven an ELECTRIC SHOCK, and is told whilethe shock IS IN ACTION that he mustobeyanddo certain things, he has no choice but to do them,or to re-experience. uecause of his mental imagepicture of it, the electric shock.

Communist Party Members,in general, not the psychopolitician.The realm of defamation and degradation ofthe psychopolitician is Man himself.

This must be made fashionable.They must be taught to frown upon ideas, uponindividual endeavor.

These must be de-famed and excluded as \"untrained\", \"unskilled\",\"quacks,\" or \"perpetrators of hoaxes.\"No mental health movement with actual goalsof mental therapy should be continued in existencehi any nation. For instance, the use of Chineseacupuncture in the treatment of mental and physi-cal derangement must, in China, be stamped outand discredited thoroughly, as it has some efficacy,and more importantly, its practitioners understand,through long conversation with it, many of theprinciples of actual mental health and aberration.In the field of mental health, the psychopoliti-cian must occupy, and continue to occupy, throughvarious arguments. the authoritative position onthe subject. There is always the danger that prob-lems of mental health may be resolved by someindividual or group, which might then derangethe program of the psychopolitical operative inhis mental health clubs.CITY OFFICIALS, SOCIALITES, and otherUNKNOWING individuals, on the subject of men-tal health, should he invited to full cooperation inthe activity of mental health groups.

To these groupsit must be continually stressed that the entire sub-ject of mental illness is so complex that none ofthem, certainly, could understand any part of it.Thus, the club should be kept on a social andfinancial level.Where groups interested in the health of thecomrnnnity have already been formed, they shouldbe infiltrated and taken over, and if this is notpossible, they should be discredited and debarred,and the officialdom of the area should be invitedto stamp them out as dangerous.When an hostile group dedicated to mentalhealth is discovered, the psychopolitician shouldhave recourse to the mechanisms of peyote, mes-caline, and later drugs which cause temporaryinsanity. He should send persons, preferably those46"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"wellunder his control, into the mental healthgroup, whether Christian Science or Dianetics offaith preachers to' demonstrate their abilities uponthis new person.These, in demonstrating theirabilities, will usually act with enthusiasm.

The patient thus demonstrating mo-mentary insanity should immediately be reportedto the police and taken away to some area of in-carceration managed by psychopolitical operatives,and so placed out of sight. Officialdom will thuscome into a belief that this group drives individ-uals insane by their practices, and the practices ofthe group will then be despised and. prohibited bylaw.The values of a widespread mental health or-ganization are manifest when one realigns that anygovernment can be forced to provide facilities forpsychopolitical operatives in the form•of psychia-Eric wards in ALL HOSPITALS, IN NATIONALINSTITUTIONS totallyinthe hands of psyd'ho-political operatives, and in the establishment ofclinics WHERE YOUTH CAN BE CONTACTEDand arranged more seemingly to the purpose ofPsychopolitics.Such groups form a political force, which canthen LEGALIZE any law or authority desired forthe psychopolitician. The securing of authorityover such mental health organizations is done main-ly by appeal to education. A psyc'hopoliticianshould make sure that those psychiatrists he con-trols, those psychologists whom he has under hisorders, have been trained for an excessively longperiod of time. The longer the training periodwhich can be required, the safer, the psychopoliti-cal program, since no new group of practitionerscan arise to disclose and dismay psychopoliticalprograms.Furthermore, the groups themselvescannot hope to obtain any full knowledge of thesubject, not having behind them many, many yearsof intensive training.Vienna has been 'carefully maintained as thehome of Psychopolitics, since it was the home ofPsychoanalysis.

Therefore, the psychopolitician must haveat hand innumberable documents which assert enor-mously encouraging figures on the subject of re-covery by reason of shock, brain surgery, drugs,and general treatment.
