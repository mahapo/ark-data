They start the car and reach for a cigarette. T: However they do say that there are a few cigarettes that they truly enjoy. Maybe after a meal, or with a cup of coffee. T: If you were going to be honest with yourself, how many cigarettes do think you really get enjoyment from C: Maybe four or five. T: Let's spend a moment and look at your smoking logically rather than emotionally. As you have said yourself, it takes you about 4 or 5 minutes to smoke a cigarette. As you have also told me there may be 4 or 5 that you really do enjoy. That means you are getting about 25 minutes of enjoyment from smoking. As we both agree it is effecting your health, but what is your health as long as you can have 25 minutes of enjoyment. You burn a few pieces of clothing, furniture, it's becoming a headache to smoke, and you get a little shortness of breath, but what's breathing. You spend about $700.00 a year, but you make a lot of money.

A few years ago an experiment involving an actor showed how powerful the sub-conscious mind truly is. In this experiment, the actor's heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure were being monitored. The actor then pretended to be very angry, and upset. Within seconds, his blood pressure began to rise. His heart rate increased. His breathing sped up considerably. All of his bodily functions began to change simply due to pretending, using his imagination. The actor was then instructed to pretend that he was slowly walking down a beautiful beach, with not a care in the world. His blood pressure began to drop. His heart rate slowed back down. His breathing became slow, and natural. So it is easy for us to see that as we imagine something, our sub-conscious will cause the body to respond in exactly the same way as though we were actually involved in the activity. I want you now to imagine yourself out jogging at a very healthy, and safe pace. Get this image deeply embedded in your mind. Imagine it. Sense it. Feel it now.

One of the reasons, that so many people do not drink more water, is that they simply do not think of-the water until after they have drank soda, or some other form of liquid. The major soda companies have spent millions of dollars in developing containers that are pleasant to the eye. In doing so, when we open the icebox, and look inside, that great looking large bottle of soda is one of the first things that we see.

In reality our own thoughts play an important role in the way that we will be feeling, and the way that we will respond in our daily activities. This situation may have happened to you at one time or the other. Think about coming home late at night from a party, or a meeting. You are laying in bed, and notice that it is now 2:00 in the morning, and you need to get up at 6:00 a.m. You say to yourself, I must get to sleep quickly. Of course the opposite tends to occur. You toss, and turn, and it is now 3:00 in the morning, and you even consider whether it is worth going to sleep for just three hours. You think in your mind, how awful you will be feeling at work the next day. You think of how you will be dragging, and grumpy. You finally fall asleep. The alarm goes of at 6:00 a.m. You get up, turn off the alarm, and then remember that you only had three hours of sleep, so you put yourself on slump. You go to work moan, and complain about only having three hours of sleep, and you warn everyone to stay away from you, you are grumpy. Now, the interesting question is. Were you dragging, and grumpy because of the three hours of sleep, or perhaps you were simply following your own suggestions. What if, the same situation had occurred, but this time you were going on a picnic the next day. This time prior to entering sleep, you said to yourself, well I am only going to have three hours of sleep tonight, but I will have a great time tomorrow, and then tomorrow night I will sleep like a rock. You would then wake up to the alarm, remember that you only had three hours of sleep, and recall your suggestion from the night before about having a great time today."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The night after the picnic, you would recall your own statements about sleeping like a rock. So you would fall asleep quickly, and sleep soundly. Most situations, and responses in our lives may be traced back to a suggestion that we have given ourselves. So, I would like you to only implant positive thoughts, and suggestions that will help you in   ."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"A BUDGET NOTES The time has come for you to start taking care of yourself. It appears that you first take care of the children, your husband, your friends, neighbors, co- workers, and strangers. Then if there is any time left over, then you take care of yourself. Guess what? There will never be any time left over if you put yourself on the bottom of the list. I have always associated, taking care of yourself with a young couple trying to save money. If they say to themselves, we will pay all of our bills, and then what ever is left over at the end of the month goes into the savings account. For most people there will never be anything left over. If the young couple started each month by taking blank dollars and putting it in the bank, they would still pay all of the bills. It works exactly the same way with you. If you would first take time out for yourself, you would still do all of the things for the people who are important in your life. So from this moment on, let's do things in the opposite way. Start taking time for you FIRST, and then see how great you feel about being there for the other people in your life."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"GOOD LEARNING EXPERIENCE NOTES T = THERAPIST C = CLIENT T: Did one of those cigarettes sneak up and get you? C: Yes, I'm afraid so. T: Tell me, what was happening when you picked up that first cigarette. C: We were out at a party, and a friend of mine was smoking, and I took one of his. T: When you picked up that first cigarette at the party, were you planning on going back to smoking? C: No, I was just going to have one. I know that you told me that I couldn't have one, but I really thought that I would have one that evening, and then never smoke again, but by the next day it was as though I had never quit at all. I guess I really made a mistake by trying that one. T: You'll find that we look at everything in a positive way. I don't think we ever make any mistakes in our lives.

I understand that there is a certain amount of excitement about reaching your goal, but some times we tend to forget that anticipation can, and usually is the best part of the event. As a child I can remember the anticipation of Christmas. I used to say that the day after, the day after, the day after tomorrow is Christmas. As a child every Christmas was wonderful, but no matter how great Christmas was, there was always more enjoyment in the anticipation of the event, than experiencing the event. Even today as an adult, we may plan a vacation, and spend weeks, or months planning, and anticipating the vacation. After the vacation is over we may realize that we received as much or more enjoyment from the planning, and anticipation of the vacation as we did from the vacation it self. So I do not want you to over look the enjoyment of anticipation that you can experience of these next few months as you progress on with weight loss. In fact you will discover that the anticipation of reaching your goal will be almost as enjoyable as reaching the goal it self. Realizing that you will be enjoying the procedure of losing weight, as much as reaching your goal, will make this endeavor pleasant, and enjoyable."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"BIG LOTTERY NOTES It has always amazed me how easily we can alter the way we think about a certain figure. I can recall a time when myself, and an associate of mine were running some errands. At this particular time the state lottery was up to over 40 million dollars. I had never been that interested in the lottery, but for 40 million dollars, I drove out of my way to purchase lottery tickets. As I was driving back to the office, fantasizing about 40 million dollars, it hit me. Here I was making a special trip to purchase lottery tickets, simple because the jackpot was million. It seemed ironic that when the jackpot was only 10 or 15 million dollars, it wasn't worth my time to drive a few miles out of my way. Who would bother spending ten minutes of their time for a measly 10 million. So often we become so involved with a large number that we tend to forget how great a smaller number can also be. I have seen individuals in the past that may need to lose a hundred pounds or more, and they seem disappointed with only loosing 20 pounds in the first month or two. In the same way that 10 million dollars is not as great as 40 million dollars, let's keep a positive outlook on each pound that you lose. With each pound you lose, you are a winner."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"DEEP SNOW NOTES It seems so often that we allow outside stimulants to rule our lives. We have all heard people say that the stress pushed me back into smoking, or the kids make me eat. It is a lot easier to use another person or event as the excuse for failure, rather than accepting the fact that we have the ability to change the way we respond to any situation or events. I can recall once a few years back when we had a terrible snowstorm. One of the neighbors was out trying to get his car out of the driveway, and was cursing up a storm. Another neighbor walked out on her porch, and said, \"I'm not going to make it to work today, but there was a good book that I have been wanting to finish. Then there was n young boy who looked at all of that snow, and said, \"thanks God\", and jumped into the snow. Each of these three people encountered the same stimulant. The snow really wasn't any deeper on one side of the street than the other. One person viewed this-as a tragedy. Another thought \"oh well\". Finally the last individual viewed this as a blessing. You too, can change the way you view any situation or circumstances, to ensure your total success."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"DOG WITH A BONE NOTES I would like to share with you a story. This is a story about a silly dog. Although everyone loved this dog, there was one thing about him that no one could understand. It seems that this dog carried a big white bone in his mouth, everywhere he went. Although the dog looked silly with that bone hanging out of his mouth, and it was truly an inconvenience for him to make sure that he always had his bone with him, he never went anywhere without it. One day after a rain shower, the dog was walking down the street and happened to catch a glimpse of himself in a puddle of water. As usual he had that silly old white bone in his mouth. It was amazing how he looked at his reflection, as if, maybe for one of the first times in his life, he was seeing himself as others see him. That dog dropped the bone to the ground, and started to walk away. He only took a step or two when he began to head back to get his bone. He looked at his reflection without the bone in his mouth, and walked right past the bone never looking back again."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"PERCENT OF LOSS NOTES First you will be very pleased at how effectively you will be loosing weight after this session is over. I would like you to do me a favor and change the way that you look at your progress. In the past you monitored your progress by how many pounds that you have lost in a given time period. From now on, I would like you to think in terms of percents. By that I mean calculate the percent of your loss, rather than pounds. For example, you need to loose fifty pounds, so once you have lost five pounds that is 10 % of your goal. Ten pounds would be 20 % of your goal, and even two and a half pounds is still 5 % of your goal. That sounds so much better than saying I have only lost pounds. You will discover that this will keep you motivated, and you will achieve total In case you haven't already noticed we look at everything in a positive way here. So I want you to see your results in weight loss also in a very positive way. Are you ready to start calculating your wonderful accomplishments in the weeks to come?"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"NO WILL POWER NOTES You told me that you did not have any will power. Now, I do not believe that to be true. Think about it. If a person did not have any will power they would not get out of bed in the morning, or go to work, or any of the other dozens of things that you do each day of your life. So you have will power. You simply have not yet begun to use that will power in the area of weight loss. Today you are going to learn to use that wonderful will power that you had all along. Most of us have many abilities and talents, but that does not mean that we necessarily use them all. Now that we both realize that you do have will power up there in that great mind of yours, are you ready to put it to work in the area of weight loss? You may also discover other abilities that you had all this time, but have not been using them until today."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"ELEPHANT NOTES I would like to share with you a little story that illustrates how powerful our minds really are. In this story a young boy went to a circus with his father. The young boy noticed a full-grown elephant that had a rope tied to his leg. The other end of the rope was tied to a wooden stake driven into the ground. The young boy asked his father, \"couldn't that big elephant pull that stake out of the ground if he really wanted to\"? The father explained, how when the elephants are just babies, they would attach a heavy chain to their leg, and hook that chain to an iron rod driven deep into the ground. The baby elephants would pull, and tug trying to get away, but they could not escape. The little elephants became so conditioned to failures, that now you could simply tie a cloth line around their leg, and hold it in your hand. Today as soon as the elephant feels the slightest resistance, he stops trying. Now, we both know what would happen if that elephant ever gave it 100 % to get free, he would be gone. Many times we as human being have failed so many times that perhaps we never honestly give it a 100 % to win. Well, today you are going to give it 100 % one more time to accomplish ."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"HEAR - SEE - FEEL - KNOW NOTES There are some wonderful, positive things beginning to take place today.

I am sure that there has been many times in your life that you were driving down the road, and found yourself reading or analyzing one of those personalized license plates. It may have been a name or a unique abbreviation. We both know that when you are driving your car, you are not consciously saying to yourself, I will be on the look out for specialized license plates. No, in fact you were not even consciously looking at any license plates initially. Your subconscious mind was evaluating, and recording everything that your eyes were seeing.

Although they may be very intelligent individuals if their only experience of hypnosis has come from television, and movies, they tend to say to themselves, I know it can't be that way but perhaps it is similar to what I have seen in the past. This is only normal. If we do not have anything to compare hypnosis to, we would normally associate it with whatever past experiences that we have encountered. I can remember one Saturday morning when I was sleeping in. My little girl came running into the bedroom, and said, \"dad you have to get up. I have been watching cartoons, and the coyote is hypnotizing the poor roadrunner\". On the cartoon they showed spirals coming from the coyotes eyes, with the roadrunner looking all glassy eyed, saying, I hear and obey. So even as young children our first contact with hypnosis usually has some type of a mystique surrounding it. In reality hypnosis is a very normal natural state."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"EAT A FLOWER NOTES I would like you to spend a moment and imagine one of the most beautiful flowers in the entire world.

Some people spent months, while other people spent years at allowing the buffet to control their lives. In all of these cases where people used to be out of control when they entered an eating establishment that had all you can eat posted, they changed the way they viewed eating. I have heard from so many people over the years that all of a sudden they started thinking about the buffet style eating as a cattle trough.

If we would add a third step to our behavior, and add analyze, we would then be in total control. So, we hit thumb with hammer, and encounter stimulant pain. We now analyze our options, throw hammer across room, kick wall, curse, or perhaps run some cold water over the thumb. By adding the third step of analyzing we may create a new alternative response. If after analyzing all options we chose to kick the wall, this would be an acceptable response, simply because we chose to react in this manner, rather than the pain controlling our lives."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"BINGES NOTES Many people who have experienced binges before, feel that they will always be bingeing.

One day a child may create a habit of whistling; the next day the habit is gone. The child may then create a habit of skipping; a few days later that habit is gone. So yes, children have the ability to create and remove habits easily. Adults are simply children grown tall. There is still a bit of child in all of us. So, we can use that childish ability to remove negative habits and behavior patterns that are no longer useful for us. You have abilities that you have never even begun to use. One of those abilities that you do possess is the ability to forget. Forgetting is an ability that is not alien to anyone. We actually learn to forget as a way of keeping our conscious mind from being cluttered with unneeded, unwanted information. We may hear a joke or, a story and even say to ourselves, \" That was good. I will remember that\". And yet somehow two days later, we have forgotten it completely. So forgetting is an ability that we can actually use. You are now beginning to forget. Forget the thoughts and ideas of smoking. Smoking is something out of the past. We no longer need it today. We can forget and let it go."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"10 STOP SIGNS NOTES With your eyes closed I would like you to picture your hands at your side.

Bowling like many they games, or sports has the object of seeing how high an individual is capable of scoring. In bowling a perfect score would be 300. Bowlers strive to reach the perfect game of 300 as the final outcome. If having 300 written out on their score sheet was so important why don't they simply fill out the score sheet with a 300 score, and not bother working at it. The reason is very evident, the joy of reaching a 300 game is obtained through some effort.

I assure you that by exercising for a minimum of 30 seconds everyday, you will be amazed at the difference in your overall well being.

He really wasn't worried about me having a heart attack, he wanted to know if another hypnotist came by, could they bring him out. Now, today I am not planning to have a heart attack, but if you were in the deepest level of hypnosis, and I decided that it was time for me to go home, and I left you there, which I would not do.

Would it be all right if I came in during the session, and asked my spouse a few questions? It seems that most people think of hypnosis in the same way that they think of the lie detectors, or truth serum. In reality they are not related at all. For sake of example, I am going to ask you a question, and I want you to lie to me. Have you ever had a glass of water? C: No. T: I didn't think so.

The subconscious takes everything literally. For example if we could communicate verbally on a subconscious level and I asked you, \"do you know what time it is\"?

Oh, it is  . Normally, if I passed you on the street and said, excuse me do you know what time it is? This time your analytical mind would go through the following thoughts. He must not have a watch. He would like me to look at my watch, secure the time, and verbally pass that information on to him. That seems safe enough. Since the subconscious can not analyze, many times we reach for food, cigarettes, or other negative behavior when in reality, we may have been searching for a totally different type of need.

Many people, have experienced purchasing an item from a store, and then a week later, they wished that they would have waited on it. When it comes to making purchases, the rule is give it seven days. If after seven days the item still has the appeal that it once had, then you can be sure that it is something that is important, or needed. Now, if you were considering eating a cookie, we both know that you are never going to wait a week to see if it was important to you. This is where the THREE-MINUTE RULE comes in. If you were tempted to eat a food that is not beneficial in helping you reach, and maintain a weight of _______ pounds, I would like you to give it three minutes before eating that food.

Then you also notice that the right side of the room has thousands of books on the shelves, while the left side has only a few books scattered on the shelves. As you walk into the room, you pick up one of the first few books on the right side of the room. As you open the book, you realize that this book is about a happy, positive moment in your life, one that has just recently occurred. It may have been coming here today. You walk halfway down through the room, and pick up another book from the right side of the room. Once again this book seems to be about another happy time, about midway in your life.

There are several reason why this will make a dramatic change in your life. First, imagine yourself sitting in front of the television watching a good movie, and the thought pops into your mind, we have chips in the cabinet. You get up, bring the bag of chips into the other room, and continue watching the movie. Sounds like fun, doesn't it? Now imagine the same situation, but this time you sit down at the kitchen table, and eat chips. It really doesn't have the impact that it once had. The other advantage is, that you can't feel deprived with this system. Basically you can have almost anything you want. The only stipulation is that you eat that food at the kitchen table.

There was a research project conducted a few years ago that took a secretary that normally typed 6 hours each day. They were able to determine that if she went from a manual typewriter, to an electric typewriter, she would gain 3 pounds over the next year. Now, that is under the premise that nothing else changed in her life. At first we would not have felt that something that simply would create such a difference. With the electric typewriter, she no longer had to push the carriage return, there was no effort exerted in feeding the paper, and she applied less pressure on the keys. If we begin to analyze just a few of the many changes that have taken place over the years, it is easy to see how our activity level has truly reduced. In today’s time most of us have the luxury of automatic transmissions, power steering, and air conditioning in our cars. At home we now use remote controls for the television, a cordless phone that keeps us from having to move too much, and many people have electric garage door openers. These are just a few of the many items that we have all become accustomed to over the years. Rapidly almost every activity is becoming push button. Now, one of these items would not cause a problem, but when we begin to combine all of the activities that have been eliminated in our daily lives, it is easy to see where the problem stems from.

She spends a few moments looking at the top of the cookie. Then she spends sometime looking at the bottom of the cookie, and even the sides of the cookie. Finally she takes the smallest little bite of the cookie, and lets it dissolve in her mouth. Then a second bite, and finally after many bites and about ten minutes of time, she takes the last tiny bite of the cookie. She picks up a few crumbs that had fallen onto the table, pops them into her mouth, and let's out a sigh of satisfaction. It is quite evident that this little girl received much more enjoyment from that one cookie than she would have from even a dozen cookies.

I will not ask you to imagine yourself in a situation that would never occur. For example I would have you ima8ine yourself as an astronaut, simply because I really do not think that you will ever become an astronaut. I would not have you think of yourself as the president of the United States. It is possible, but I doubt that you are ever going to become the president of the United States. So we understand that only the type of images or thoughts that I will have you create are images and thoughts of things that will definitely occur.

There were three gods that were trying to decide where to hide the greatest power in the universe, where man would not be able to find it, and use it destructively. The first god said, \" I know where to hide it, let's hide the greatest power of the universe on top of the highest mountain, man will never think to look for it there\". But it was decided that some day man, might climb the highest mountain, and discover this power. The second god said, \" let's hide the greatest power of the universe at the bottom of the sea\". Again it was agreed that someday man might explore the bottom of the sea, and thus discover the greatest power of the universe. Finally the third god said, \"I know, let's hide the greatest power of the universe in the mind of man, they will never think to look for it there\". So according to the fable, the three gods hid the greatest power of the universe in the mind of man. Now, although this is a fable, our minds have the greatest power of the universe."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"DRUGS NOTES You asked me earlier if you should keep, or throw away your cigarettes. Let me ask you, do you have any heroin in your purse? Of course not. The reason that you do not have any heroin in your purse is because that is something that you are not going to use today, and it is something that you do not plan on using in the future. Basically the only thing that you keep on you is things that you will be using today, or things that you plan to be using in the near future. Since you will not need, or have to smoke, there is no longer any reason for you to have cigarettes with you. As you throw them away, you will feel as though some great, heavy burden has been lifted from you. You are now in control of your own life, and actions.

Doesn't that sound great? Put you down for that one right. The second category, with about another 30% will not have any craving for a cigarette but may experience an automatic reaching. For example the telephone may ring and you reach for a cigarette, and then realize, I don't smoke anymore. The thought will fade away almost as quickly as it entered your mind. The third category, with another 30% may have a little bit of a mind battle going on. I think I would like to have a cigarette with this cup of coffee, piece of pie, YES ... NO ... YES ... NO ...

I tell them, well it sounds like you wasted dollars and an hour of my time. Honestly, if you said I changed my mind, and I don't want you to hypnotize me, I am going to really try to quit on my own. Well surly you could make it a couple of hours wouldn't you agree? C: Oh, I could make it at least a day. T: Of course you could, so the person who walks to the parking lot, which takes about two minutes, and lights a cigarettes, did not try very hard. They could have done better than that without me.

They are WHAT IF ? Yes, we can use these two words \"what if\" and begin to worry about something that might, possible, you never know could happen. By using these two words we can create a tragedy for any day of our lives. What if I went home tonight, and my spouse handed me a rose. What if the rose had a thorn on it. What if I pricked my finger. What if the finger became infected. What if I couldn't find a good doctor. What if they then had to amputate my arm What if I was now driving with only one arm. What if I got into an accident. What if a piece of glass from the windshield cut my vocal cords. What if I could never talk again. I would be out of business. I'm not going home tonight.

No matter how much an individual may enjoy their job, there would not be to many people showing up for work if the company made a statement that they were no longer paying wages. So the amount of the reward must be equal to or greater than the amount of effort given. Sometimes in weight loss we tend to forget what we will be receiving for the effort that we are giving. If I offered to sell you any car in the world for $ 5.00, that would be a bargain. Now, surely you would not be driving home from here in your new car, and be complaining that you no longer had your five-dollar bill. The reason that you would not have any complaints with this exchange, is that you would feel like you gained much more than you gave. When you reach a weight level of _________ pounds, you will feel better, you will look better, your confidence will grow, and you will begin to like yourself more. All of these benefits, and rewards for simply becoming more selective in the foods that you eat. In reality, the amount of effort to reach your goal is very similar to the five-dollar car.

I am sure that we both agree that all of those actions would be ridiculous, and not thought of. What a waste of money that would be. You are now beginning to realize how silly, how ridiculous it is for you to have paid for a membership that you are not even using. You would never buy a new outfit, and not ever wear it. You would not even think of buying a new home, for the purpose of leaving it vacant.

As you may have already experienced, the scare tactics do not work. The thought is to show you a picture of an old black lung, and say this is what your lungs look like. You are expected to look at the photo, and say oh my God I will never smoke again. If the photo was extremely disgusting, you might cut down for a day or two, but you most likely would not quit. I know that if I am driving down the road, and see a bad traffic accident, I then become the best driver in the world, for about the next 5 miles.

There are still others that may know what they should be doing, but have trouble in accepting the fact that they have the ability to make correct choices. Regardless of how you felt before, it is now time to take control of your own life, and realize how much control you always had. For example if you had a headache, you might take an aspirin. You would not even consider taking a half of a bottle of aspirin, or perhaps taking heart medication in place of the aspirin for a headache. If you felt fine, you wouldn't take anything. So, when it comes to medication, you have the ability to take the type that is needed, the quantity that is needed, and only when it is needed.

Thousands it is to people in of individuals grew up hearing about how sinful waste food. Many of us heard about the poor in China that are starving to death. Sometimes we say to ourselves, that there isn't enough to save, and I hate to throw it out, so I'll just finish it off. I would like you to use your imagination with me. Let's pretend that I have a magic button. If I would push this magic button you would instantly reduce down to a level of _____ pounds, and stay there. Now, if I told you that I would push this magic button if you would go home, and throw away $100.00 worth of good food, we both know what you would do. Although it might seem like a waste to throw out $ 100.00 worth of perfect food, you would do so if you could instantly reach a weight of  . I do not want you to go home and throw away food. What I would like you to do is the next time there is a little of this or that left over, and you begin to mentally battle whether or not to throw it out or eat it, think back to this example.

However there is another very important reason to become free of this smoking habit. No one wants to be controlled by another individual. So, it is only natural that no one would want to be controlled by an object. Up to this moment cigarettes have been controlling your life. They have been telling you what to do. Imagine for me a large pack of your cigarettes, about three-foot tall. Now, think about that pack of cigarettes with hands, and arms, feet and legs. It has a face right on top. It is the face of the person that you dislike the most in the world, maybe a pushy type of person. Think of that large pack of cigarettes pointing it's finger at you and saying, \"I know that you wanted to quit smoking, but I can control your life\". You don't want to hear this, you don't need to hear this. Notice how that large pack of cigarettes is now changing. The hands and arms are fading away. The feet and legs are vanishing. That head, the face of the person that you dislike the most is now leaving. The entire pack of cigarettes is now beginning to shrink, and fade away. It is becoming smaller, and smaller.

Many people find it difficult to comprehend drinking six, to eight glasses of water each day. We are going to make it easier for you than ever before to drink the water you need.

Now, instead of pouring liquor in the shot glass, I would like you to take a shot of water each time you walk by the kitchen sink. You will amaze yourself at how easy, and simply it will be to consume a large amount of water, without really working at it. Although you will now be establishing this new policy of taking a shot of water each time you walk by the kitchen sink, do not discontinue your normal water drinking.

There are several things different from this beach from any other beach in the world. One of the things different from this beach, is that on this beach there is not any pollution. Everything is beautiful. On one side of you is the beautiful water, while on the other side are flowers, trees, and vegetation. The other thing different from this beach is that you are the only one on this beach. That means you can be yourself. There is no need to pretend or to act. So often when we walk down a beach that is crowded with others we have a tendency to hold our stomach, and stand a little straighter. Today you can be yourself. As you think of yourself walking down this beach you notice that a young child has written the numbers from 5 down to 1 in the moist sand. Perhaps with a stick. these numbers have been written for you. You go up to the number 5, and lightly slide your foot across the number 5. the number 5 fades away, and you relax even further. You are not sure exactly how, or why this happens, but you wonder could the same thing happen to you again. You go to the number 4, and once again you slide your foot across the number 4, it fades away, and you relax even deeper again. You are now beginning to feel as though you have discovered something wonderful. You go to the number 3, and this time as you begin to slide your foot across the number 3.

You remember where once there was the number 5, the number 4, and the number 3, now the sand is smooth, and flat. However, you feel as though you have only done things half way. You do not want to do things half way. You go down to the number 2, and as you begin to slide your foot across the number 2, the water comes in, and covers your toes. The water does most of the work for you, and you relax even deeper again. You are now feeling great. As you begin to slide your foot across the number 1, the water comes in all the way up to your ankles. The water now does all of the work for you. The number one fades away, and you relax further again. Once more you look back at the beach. You remember that on the number 5 you put forth some effort, and the number 5 faded away. You relaxed further. You did not stop simply due to effort. You continued on to the number 4. Once again you put forth the effort, and the number 4 faded away. By the time you reached the number 3, the water came in, and did some of the work for you . By the time you reached the number 2, the water was doing most of the work for you.

Many people say that cigarettes, coffee, or candy help them relax, and unwind. In reality all three of these substances tend us more stressful, or hyper. So why do so many people associate relaxing with chemicals that are stimulants? More often than not, we find ourselves falling into the habit of associating objects with taking a break. For example we have all heard statements such as, It is time for a coffee break. A cigarette break would be nice. I am going to take a break, and grab something to eat. Many times what is happening is a person may feel that he or she needs to justify why they are taking a break. If I worked for you and said, \"I have really been busy, would it be alright if I took a break, and had a cup of coffee\"? Or perhaps the request would be, would it be all right if I took a break, and grab a candy bar? Then there is, would it be alright if I took a short cigarette break? Each one of these three request seems almost normal to us. It seems logical to take a break and overdose on sugar, caffeine, or nicotine. Now if I asked, \"would it be alright if I took a break for a few minutes, and did absolutely nothing, maybe just stare out of the window\"? Your response would be, do you feel ok, is there anything wrong?"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"What is wrong, is that we have forgotten that we do have the right to take a break, and allow our minds, and bodies to relax, without the association of sugars, caffeine, or nicotine.

As you are well aware of weight loss is one of the most complex behaviors that people encounter, but with your determination and the aid of hypnosis you will reach, and maintain a weight level of ______ pounds. One of the amazing things that you will discover today is that hypnosis will help you in the area of becoming free of the old behavior of giving up. I am sure that you have experienced before the routine of doing well at loosing weight, and then you went off of the program one time, and it seemed impossible to get back on track. It is almost as if we said to ourselves, well, I already ate that cookie, so I might as well have the ice cream too. Weight loss is the only behavior that when we make a mistake we punish ourselves by eating the wrong foods again. Wouldn't it be silly if we were carrying a tray of glasses, and one of the glasses fell off, and broke if we simply turned the tray up side down, and said, well, I might as well brake the rest of them. How would it be if we were backing the car out of the driveway, and bumped into a telephone pole, if we said, now I guess I'll wreck the front of the car too. These examples seem silly. However in the past you may have responded in the same way in regards to your eating habits.

I don't know if I expected to see them folded in two on the second shelf. No, I was starting to reach for food for companionship. It would seem silly to sit on the couch, watching television with our arm around a watermelon. Yet so often we use food as a replacement for human companionship. Once we start to realize that we are eating because of boredom, depression, time of day, other people, stress, reward, or companionship, we are then capable of creating a new way of responding to the food. Almost everyone has found a time when they thought that they were hungry, and went to the icebox, or cabinet. They ate a few bites, and said, no, that's no it.

The one area of our lives that constantly changes, is the way we think. It has always amazed me that when a certain situation was going on, and a particular thought or feeling was 8enerated we have a tendency to think that we will always feel the same way. Some feelings or thoughts will automatically change themselves with time. Other thoughts or feelings can be changed at will. I can remember as a teenager growing up, how impressed, and envious I was when I saw some one driving a new corvette. Today when I see some one pulling into the parking lot with a new corvette, my thoughts are, I feel sorry for them with that high car payment, and outrageous insurance.

The more frequently an individual rehearses the better the performance will be. All of us have encountered this same proven theory in our daily lives. It might have been at work, or around the house. I am sure that there has been occasions when you mentally planed or rehearsed how you were going to respond or accomplish a certain task. Today I would like you to mentally rehearse how you are going to respond to eating. Imagine yourself at home, or away and being in control of the foods, and the liquids that you consume. Think of yourself being tempted to slip back into that old negative way of eating, but instead of giving in to the temptation rehearse the new way that you will be responding. Imagine someone offering you some type of sweets, and this time you are saying \"no thank you\". Think of yourself being tempted to reach for food because of boredom, stress, anxieties, time of day, or other people. Now mentally rehearse your new response of saying no, to that thought or temptation.

The best location would be the kitchen table. The average person has at least four or five separate locations with in the house that they routinely eat at. It may be the kitchen table, the living room, or family room. Some people find themselves eating in front of the icebox or at the counter. It is a proven fact that if you would decrease your eating to only one location you would also dramatically decrease your overall food intake. Imagine going Christmas, or birthday shopping, and you travel to ten different stores. There is a strong likelihood that you would spend more money purchasing a few items at ten different stores, than you would have by confining your shopping to a single store. The same holds true, in regards to our eating habits. If we stay with a single location within the home to eat at, we will automatically, easily and permanently, decrease our food intake."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"THE COFFEE TASTER NOTES I would like you to imagine a young man in his mid-thirties.

He now spends a few more moments totally enjoying the wonderful aroma of the coffee. Only after enjoying the sight, and the aroma of the coffee does this professional coffee taster allow a few drops of the liquid to touch his lips, and tongue. He then savors the delegate taste of the coffee. Now, compare this professional coffee taster to the person that would be sitting in an old coffee shop, slurping down the cup of coffee so quickly that he really did not even have a chance to enjoy the sight, the aroma, or the taste of the coffee. Just as drinking coffee that can be an art, eating can also become an art by learning to eat properly. From this moment on, I want you to spend a few moments to appreciate the sight of the food that you are about to eat.

Now, of course you did not go to an evil hypnotist, but many people have a negative thought that may be working against them on their desire to achieve success. Everything that you have ever seen, heard, felt or read is stored in you mind. Sometimes, we say encounter an event that the subconscious mind took as meaning that you should be overweight, and thus we have that second thought working against us.

I had a lady in a few years back that called me on the telephone after a weight loss session, saying it did not work. When I asked her, what didn't it do? She replied that she left my office, and went home, and ate a half a gallon of ice cream. When I asked her if she felt compelled to do so, or had a strong urge, she said, “No, I just wanted to see if hypnosis could stop me\".

The second category, with about another thirty percent will say, there may have been a moment when a temptation to reach for the wrong types of food entered their minds, but it faded away in just an instant. For example, some one may have brought in a plate of cookies, and automatically they started to reach for one, and then realized that they haven't done that in over a month. The third category, with another thirty- percent may experience a little bit of a mind battle. I think I might like a piece of that cake with this cup of coffee. Yes, no, yes, no, NO I will not do it. Simply give it a few moments and the thought will fade away. I would imagine that you could handle any one of these three categories."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"CAKE NOTES I am sure that you have heard many times how important it is to eat slowly, and chew each bite thoroughly. There was a time in the past that I discovered the true importance of eating slowly. I was at a restaurant, and ate my meal extremely quickly. By eating quickly, I still felt hungry even though I had consumed more than enough food. Thinking that I must still be hungry, I ordered a piece of cake for dessert. The waitress got busy, and it took a little while for her to return with my much-needed cake. During the time that I was waiting for the cake, I started to feel full, and satisfied. I then started to feel almost stuffed, by the time the cake arrived, and after consuming the cake I felt bloated, and miserable. If I had eaten the meal at a slower pace, I would have given my system a chance to react and feel full, and satisfied, and thus not needing, or wanting the cake.

The damage caused by the smoke was already fading away. There was a dramatic difference in the air. By three weeks even that old smell of the smoke was totally gone. By the time a month has passed by, it would have been almost impossible for anyone to even tell that there ever was smoke damage.

I am sure that there have been many times that you have attempted to reach a goal of 125 pounds, and have failed. So your mind has recorded failures at reaching a weight of 125 pounds. You have never tried to reach a level of 123 pounds before, so we will be starting fresh. I realize that at a conscious level it really does not make any difference to you, whether your weight was at 123 or 125 pounds.

I am sure that you have dozens of different, valid reasons for wanting to be a nonsmoker as of today. In reality it has been proven that cigarette smoking does not serve any useful purpose in your daily life. In fact many people are beginning to realize a fact that growers of tobacco have known for years. I once talked with a young man whose father owned a large tobacco farm. Even though he, and his family have been involved in growing tobacco for a number of years, he could not understand why anyone would choose to smoke. This young man related how every year they would spread tons, and tons, of manure over the tobacco fields, and even after the tobacco was harvested the odor of the manure seemed to cling to the tobacco leaves. This young man wanted to know why, any intelligent person would want to put an old dried up weed that has been saturated with manure in their mouth, and light it. Although I spend my life talking, this time I was speechless."}]
