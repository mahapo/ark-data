When we gained literacy, we learned not just how to read but how to write. And as we move into an increasingly digital reality, we must learn not just how to use programs but how to make them. In the emerging, highly programmed landscape ahead, you will either create the soft ware or you will be the soft ware. It’s really that simple: Program, or be programmed. Choose the former, and you gain access to the control panel of civilization."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"8 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF Choose the latt er, and it could be the last real choice you get to make. For while digital technologies are in many ways a natural outgrowth of what went before, they are also markedly diff erent. Computers and networks are more than mere tools: They are like living things, themselves. Unlike a rake, a pen, or even a jackhammer, a digital technology is programmed. This means it comes with instructions not just for its use, but also for itself. And as such technologies come to characterize the future of the way we live and work, the people programming them take on an increasingly important role in shaping our world and how it works. Aft er that, it’s the digital technologies themselves that will be shaping our world, both with and without our explicit cooperation. That’s why this moment matt ers. We are creating a blueprint together—a design for our collective future. The possibilities for social, economic, practical, artistic, and even spiritual progress are tremendous. Just as words gave people the ability to pass on knowledge for what we now call civilization, networked activity could soon off er us access to shared thinking—an extension of consciousness still inconceivable to most of us today. The operating principles of commerce and culture—from supply and demand to command and control—could conceivably give way to an entirely more engaged, connected, and collaborative mode of participation."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"9 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED But so far, anyway, too many of us are fi nding our digital networks responding unpredictably or even opposed to our intentions. Retailers migrate online only to fi nd their prices undercut by automatic shopping aggregators. Culture creators seize interactive distribution channels only to grow incapable of fi nding people willing to pay for content they were happy to purchase before. Educators who looked forward to accessing the world’s bounty of information for their lessons are faced with students who believe that fi nding an answer on Wikipedia is the satisfactory fulfi llment of an inquiry. Parents who believed their kids would intuitively multitask their way to professional success are now concerned those same kids are losing the ability to focus on any one thing. Political organizers who believed the Internet would consolidate their constituencies fi nd that net petitions and self-referential blogging now serve as substitutes for action. Young people who saw in social networks a way to redefi ne themselves and their allegiances across formerly sacrosanct boundaries are now conforming to the logic of social networking profi les and fi nding themselves the victims of marketers and character assassination.

Educated laypeople who saw in the net a new opportunity for amateur participation in previously cordoned- off sectors of media and society instead see the indiscriminate mashing and mixing up of prett y much everything, in an environment where the loud and lewd drown out anything that takes more than a few moments to understand. Social and community organizers who saw in social media a new, safe way for people to gather, voice their opinions, and eff ect bott om-up change are oft en recoiling at the way networked anonymity breeds mob behavior, merciless att ack, and thoughtless responses. A society that looked at the Internet as a path toward highly articulated connections and new methods of creating meaning is instead fi nding itself disconnected, denied deep thinking, and drained of enduring values. It doesn’t have to turn out this way. And it won’t if we simply learn the biases of the technologies we are using and become conscious participants in the ways they are deployed. Faced with a networked future that seems to favor the distracted over the focused, the automatic over the considered, and the contrary over the compassionate, it’s time to press the pause butt on and ask what all this means to the future of our work, our lives, and even our species. And while the questions"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"11 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED may be similar in shape to those facing humans passing through other great technological shift s, they are even more signifi cant this time around—and they can be more directly and purposely addressed. The big, unrecognized news here is about a whole lot more than multitasking, pirated MP3s, or superfast computers at the investment houses shortcutt ing our stock trades. It is that thinking itself is no longer—at least no longer exclusively—a personal activity. It’s something happening in a new, networked fashion. But the cybernetic organism, so far, is more like a cybernetic mob than new collective human brain. People are being reduced to externally confi gurable nervous systems, while computers are free to network and think in more advanced ways than we ever will. The human response, if humanity is going to make this leap along with our networked machines, must be a wholesale reorganization of the way we operate our work, our schools, our lives, and ultimately our nervous systems in this new environment. “Interior life,” such as it is, began in the Axial Age and was then only truly recognized as late as the Renaissance. It is a construction that has served its role in gett ing us this far, but must be loosened to include entirely new forms of collective and extra-human activity. This is uncomfortable for many, but the refusal to adopt a new style of engagement dooms us to a behavior and psychology that is increasingly vulnerable to the biases and agendas of"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"12 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF our networks—many of which we are utt erly unaware we programmed into them in the fi rst place. Resistance is futile, but so is the abandonment of personal experience scaled to the individual human organism. We are not just a hive mind operating on a plane entirely divorced from individual experience. There is a place for humanity—for you and me—in the new cybernetic order. The good news is we have undergone such profound shift s before. The bad news is that each time, we have failed to exploit them eff ectively. In the long run, each media revolution off ers people an entirely new perspective through which to relate to their world. Language led to shared learning, cumulative experience, and the possibility for progress. The alphabet led to accountability, abstract thinking, monotheism, and contractual law. The printing press and private reading led to a new experience of individuality, a personal relationship to God, the Protestant Reformation, human rights, and the Enlightenment. With the advent of a new medium, the status quo not only comes under scrutiny; it is revised and rewritt en by those who have gained new access to the tools of its creation. Unfortunately, such access is usually limited to small elite. The Axial Age invention of the twenty-two-lett er alphabet did not lead to a society of literate Israelite readers, but a society of hearers, who would gather in the town square to listen to the Torah scroll read to them by a rabbi. Yes, it was"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"13 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED bett er than being ignorant slaves, but it was a result far short of the medium’s real potential. Likewise, the invention of the printing press in the Renaissance led not to a society of writers but one of readers; except for a few cases, access to the presses was reserved, by force, for the use of those already in power. Broadcast radio and television were really just extensions of the printing press: expensive, one-to-many media that promote the mass distribution of the stories and ideas of a small elite at the center. We don’t make TV; we watch it. Computers and networks fi nally off er us the ability to write. And we do write with them on our websites, blogs, and social networks. But the underlying capability of the computer era is actually programming—which almost none of us knows how to do. We simply use the programs that have been made for us, and enter our text in the appropriate box on the screen. We teach kids how to use soft ware to write, but not how to write soft ware. This means they have access to the capabilities given to them by others, but not the power to determine the value-creating capabilities of these technologies for themselves. Like the participants of media revolutions before our own, we have embraced the new technologies and literacies of our age without actually learning how they work and work on us. And so we, too, remain one step behind the capability actually being off ered us. Only an elite—sometimes a new"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF elite, but an elite nonetheless—gains the ability to fully exploit the new medium on off er. The rest learn to be satisfi ed with gaining the ability off ered by the last new medium. The people hear while the rabbis read; the people read while those with access to the printing press write; today we write, while our techno-elite programs. As a result, most of society remains one full dimensional leap of awareness and capability behind the few who manage to monopolize access to the real power of any media age. And this time, the stakes are actually even higher. Before, failing meant surrendering our agency to a new elite. In a digital age, failure could mean relinquishing our nascent collective agency to the machines themselves. The process appears to have already begun. Aft er all, who or what is really the focus of the digital revolution? Instead of marveling at a person or group who have gained the ability to communicate in a new way, we tend to marvel at the tools through which all this is happening. We don’t celebrate the human stars of this medium, the way we marveled at the stars of radio, fi lm, or television; we are mesmerized instead by the screens and touchpads themselves. Likewise, we aspire less to the connectivity enjoyed by our peers than to the simple possession of the shiny new touchpad devices in their laps. Instead of pursuing new abilities, we fetishize new toys. Meanwhile, we tend to think less about how to integrate"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"15 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED new tools into our lives than about how simply to keep up. Businesses throw money at social networks because they think that’s the way to market in a digital age. Newspapers go online less because they want to than because they think they have to—and with largely disastrous results. Likewise, elementary school boards adopt “laptop” curriculums less because they believe that they’ll teach bett er than because they fear their students will miss out on something if they don’t. We feel proud that we’re willing to do or spend whatever it takes to use this stuff —with litt le regard to how it actually impacts our lives. Who has time to think about it, anyway? As a result, instead of optimizing our machines for humanity—or even the benefi t of some particular group—we are optimizing humans for machinery. And that’s why the choices we make (or don’t make) right now really do matt er as much or more than they did for our ancestors contending with language, text, and printing. The diff erence is in the nature of the capability on off er— namely, programming. We are not just extending human agency through a new linguistic or communications system. We are replicating the very function of cognition through external, extra-human mechanisms. These tools are not mere extensions of the will of some individual or group, but tools that have the ability to think and operate other components in the neural network—namely, us. If we want to participate"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"16 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF in this activity, we need to engage in a renaissance of human capacity nothing short of (actually more signifi cant than) the assumption by the Israelites of a new human code of conduct capable of organizing what had been preliterate tribes into a full-fl edged civilization. The Torah was not merely a by- product of text, but a code of ethics for dealing with the highly abstracted, text-based society that was to characterize the next two millennia. Only this time, instead of an enduring myth to elevate these ideas to laws, we need to rely on a purpose and on values as real and powerful as the science and logic our machines are using in their own evolutionary ascent. The strategies we have developed to cope with new mediating technologies in the past will no longer serve us— however similar in shape the computing revolution may appear to previous reckonings with future shock. For instance, the unease pondering what it might mean to have some of our thinking done out of body by an external device is arguably just a computer-era version of the challenges to self-image or “proprioception” posed by industrial machinery. The industrial age challenged us to rethink the limits of the human body: Where does my body end and the tool begin? The digital age challenges us to rethink the limits of the human mind: What are the boundaries of my cognition? And while machines once replaced and usurped the value of human labor, computers and networks do more"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"17 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED than usurp the value of human thought. They not only copy our intellectual processes—our repeatable programs—but they also discourage our more complex processes—our higher order cognition, contemplation, innovation, and meaning making that should be the reward of “outsourcing” our arithmetic to silicon chips in the fi rst place. The way to get on top of all this, of course, would be to have some inkling of how these “thinking” devices and systems are programmed—or even to have some input into the way it is being done, and for what reasons. Back in the earliest days of personal computing, we may not have understood how our calculators worked, but we understood exactly what they were doing for us: adding one number to another, fi nding a square root, and so on. With computers and networks, unlike our calculators, we don’t even know what we are asking our machines to do, much less how they are going to go about doing it. Every Google search is—at least for most of us—a Hail Mary pass into the datasphere, requesting something from an opaque black box. How does it know what is relevant? How is it making its decisions? Why can’t the corporation in charge tell us? And we have too litt le time to consider the consequences of not knowing everything we might like to about our machines. As our own obsolescence looms, we continue to accept new technologies into our lives with litt le or no understanding of how these devices work and work on us."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"18 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF We do not know how to program our computers, nor do we care. We spend much more time and energy trying to fi gure out how to use them to program one another instead. And this is potentially a grave mistake. As one who once extolled the virtues of the digital to the uninitiated, I can’t help but look back and wonder if we adopted certain systems too rapidly and unthinkingly. Or even irreversibly. But those of us cheering for humanity also get unsett led a bit too easily, ourselves. We are drawn into obsessing over the disconnecting possibilities of technology, serving as litt le more than an equal and opposite force to those techno-libertarians celebrating the Darwinian wisdom of hive economics. Both extremes of thought and prediction are a symptom of thinking too litt le rather than too much about all this. They are artifacts of thinking machines that force digital, yes or no, true or false reconciliation of ideas and paradoxes that could formerly be sustained in a less deterministic fashion. Contemplation itself is devalued. The sustained thought required now is the sort of real refl ection that happens inside a human brain thinking alone or relating to others in small self-selecting groups, however elitist that may sound to the techno-mob. Freedom—even in a digital age—means freedom to choose how and with whom you do your refl ection, and not everything needs to be posted for the entire world with “comments on” and “copyright off .” In fact, it’s the inability to draw these boundaries and distinctions—or"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"19 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED the political incorrectness of suggesting the possibility—that paints us into corners, and prevents meaningful, ongoing, open-ended discussion. And I believe it’s this meaning we are most in danger of losing. No matt er the breadth of its capabilities, the net will not bestow upon humans the fuel or space we need to wrestle with its implications and their meaning. We are aware of the many problems engendered by the digital era. What is called for now is a human response to the evolution of these technologies all around us. We are living in a diff erent world than the one we grew up in—one even more profoundly diff erent than the world of the alphabet was from the oral society that existed for millennia before it. That changing society codifi ed what was happening to it through the Torah and eventually the Talmud, preparing people to live in a textual age. Like they did, we need to codify the changes we are undergoing, and develop a new ethical, behavioral, and business template through which to guide us. Only this time it must actually work. We are living through a real shift —one that has already crashed our economy twice, changed the way we educate and entertain ourselves, and altered the very fabric of human relationships. Yet, so far, we have very litt le understanding of what is happening to us and how to cope. Most of the smart folks who could help us are too busy consulting to corporations—teaching them how to maintain their faltering"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"20 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF monopolies in the face of the digital tsunami. Who has time to consider much else, and who is going to pay for it? But it’s a conversation that needs to be started now. So please accept this fi rst eff ort at a “poetics” of digital media in the humble spirit in which it is off ered: ten simple commands that might help us forge a path through the digital realm. Each command is based on one of the tendencies or “biases” of digital media, and suggests how to balance that bias with the needs of real people living and working in both physical and virtual spaces—sometimes at the very same time. A bias is simply a leaning—a tendency to promote one set of behaviors over another. All media and all technologies have biases. It may be true that “guns don’t kill people, people kill people”; but guns are a technology more biased to killing than, say, clock radios. Televisions are biased toward people sitt ing still in couches and watching. Automobiles are biased toward motion, individuality, and living in the suburbs. Oral culture is biased toward communicating in person, while writt en culture is biased toward communication that doesn’t happen between people in the same time and place. Film photography and its expensive processes were biased toward scarcity, while digital photography is biased toward immediate and widespread distribution. Some cameras even upload photos to websites automatically, turning the click of the shutt er into an act of global publishing. To most of us, though, that “click” still feels the same,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"21 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED even though the results are very diff erent. We can’t quite feel the biases shift ing as we move from technology to technology, or task to task. Writing an email is not the same as writing a lett er, and sending a message through a social networking service is not the same as writing an email. Each of the acts not only yields diff erent results, but demands diff erent mind- sets and approaches from us. Just as we think and behave diff erently in diff erent sett ings, we think and behave diff erently when operating diff erent technology. Only by understanding the biases of the media through which we engage with the world can we diff erentiate between what we intend, and what the machines we’re using intend for us—whether they or their programmers even know it."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" I. TIME Do Not Be Always On The human nervous system exists in the present tense. We live in a continuous “now,” and time is always passing for us. Digital technologies do not exist in time, at all. By marrying our time- based bodies and minds to technologies that are biased against time altogether, we end up divorcing ourselves from the rhythms, cycles, and continuity on which we depend for coherence. "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"23 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED The beauty of the early net was its timelessness. Conversations took place on bulletin boards over periods of weeks or months. People got onto the Internet by connecting their computers to phone lines, and then dialing in through a modem to a server. All this not only took time, but made going online an intentional act. Most of life was spent offl ine, and a few special moments or even hours in the evening were spent online, exploring fi les and participating in discussions. Since everyone was logging in from diff erent locations at diff erent times, most online experiences were what we called “asynchronous.” This meant that, unlike a regular conversation or phone call where we exist together in the same moment and speak back and forth in real time, these online conversations were more like passing lett ers back and forth. You would go online, fi nd the conversation you were participating in, and then see all the posts that occurred between one evening and the next. Aft er reading everyone’s responses, you would then decide whether you wanted to add something—and either compose it on the spot, or write the response offl ine and then come back and paste it in later or even the next day. These discussions took on the quality of playing a chess game by mail. Nothing was rushed. If anything, because our conversations were asynchronous, we had the luxury of deeply considering what we said. The net became a place for doing the kind of deliberation and contemplation that couldn’t happen in the harried real world of jobs, kids, and automobiles."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"24 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF Because online activities did not have to occur in real time, we ended up having all the time in the world. One actually thought before responding—sometimes a whole day. This fostered a depth of engagement and a collaborative spirit that many of us had never experienced before. Even a heated exchange was pursued with fi nesse, combatants having the time to cool down and consider the best retort instead of simply lashing out. The point of conversation became the conversation itself, and the modeling of a new form of approaching problems as a group. No wonder then, that so many people saw the Internet as panacea to the world’s many confl icts and intractable divides. It shouldn’t surprise us that this deliberate, highly sequential mode of behavior is utt erly consistent with the programs and code underlying the digital universe. Digital technologies are biased away from time, and toward asynchronicity. Their operating systems were designed this way because, in most respects, computers think much faster than people. They can give themselves new instructions almost instantaneously. But they also need to be able to wait as long as necessary for instructions from a person typing through a keyboard. So programmers decided that computers shouldn’t live in time at all. (Yes, there are clocks running in the background on all computers, but they take their orders regardless of the passage of time.) Instead of operating in time, computers operate from"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"25 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED decision to decision, choice to choice. Nothing happens between the moments I type any two lett ers on the keyboard. As far as the computer is concerned, this word is the same as this one, even though I took one second to produce the fi rst, and a full minute to produce the second. The machine waits for the next command, and so on, and so on. The time between those commands can be days, or a millisecond. Because computer code is biased away from continuous time, so too are the programs built on it, and the human behaviors those programs encourage . Everything that we do in the digital realm both benefi ts and suff ers from its occurrence outside time. Maybe that’s why the net’s fi rst true “killer app” was email. At fi rst, email did not replace the lett er so much as it replaced the phone call. Instead of having to fi nd and catch a real person at home (cell phones were not yet very common), email found a person when he or she wanted to be found. Email was an activity one went and did, usually on a daily or twice-daily basis. (Before and aft er work, in most cases!) Unlike the phone, which interrupts our day by unexpectedly ringing whenever someone wants to reach us, email was retrieved when we wanted to see it. And we were free to respond in our own time, on our own conditions. If we didn’t have a response at the ready, we could come back later. The underlying asychronous quality of email and conferencing was much more obvious to us back then, because"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"26 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF we all saw the way these tools really worked. Back then, phone calls still cost money, as did our access time. So our computers generally went online, logged into a server, downloaded everything we were supposed to see, and then logged off again. We did most of our responding while we weren’t even online. Then, the next time we went online, our computers would upload the email and posts we had writt en. Was it slower? Perhaps. But it was also a more accurate refl ection of the way the technologies work, and their bias away from real-time communication. Their strength was never their relationship to the “now,” but their ability to slow down or break up the now. The interactive urge itself—even before computers came into our lives—was consistent with this desire to break time. The fi rst interactive device most of us ever used was the remote control. More than simply allowing us to change channels at the end of a TV program, the remote control gave us the ability to change channels during a TV program. The remote control allowed us to deconstruct the narrative of a show, or even a commercial. Until interactivity, we were defenseless emotional targets for the advertiser, who could use a linear story to put us in a state of vulnerability. Think of almost any television commercial: A person gets in terrible trouble, the product gets her out. A girl gets a pimple before the prom. She tries all sorts of things to get rid of it, making matt ers worse. Just"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"27 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED when it looks like all is lost, she fi nds the miracle cream. It works, boyfriend shows up, happy prom girl. The continuous narrative arc is used to draw the audience into a state of tension. Only the storyteller—the advertiser—has the way out. To be released from tension, we must accept the storyteller’s answer—meaning the advertiser’s product. We may have understood that the people making us anxious were not our friends—that the stuff on television is called “programming” for a reason. But we were relatively powerless to do anything about it other than not watch at all. Before the remote control, the only other way out of imposed anxiety was to get up out of the recliner, take the popcorn off our lap, manually change the channel, and maybe adjust the rabbit ears (an antenna that sat on top of the set for receiving terrestrial broadcast). The amount of eff ort outweighed the anxiety we were to endure by sitt ing through the rest of the commercial. But aft er the remote control, escape from the advertiser’s spell becomes eff ortless. With a micro-motion of the thumb, we are gone. The interactive device introduces discontinuity into an otherwise continuous medium. And this discontinuity—this deconstruction of story—is a form of power. Likewise, The VCR allowed us to record shows to watch later, and DVR lets us do not only that, but also “pause” shows during broadcast and fast-forward through commercials. Each step of the way, we use the asynchronous bias of digital"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"28 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF technology to take control of time. And a medium once celebrated for its ability to “program” the public becomes open to our intervention. Instead of only fostering social programming, the television also fosters a new, postmodern perspective on society’s time-honored truths. From Bart Simpson to Stephen Colbert, conventions are turned on their heads. The spirit of the digital age still fi nds its expression in this reappropriation of time. Our cutt ing and pasting, mash-ups and remixes, satires and send-ups all originate in this ability to pause, refl ect, and rework. As Internet connections grow faster, fatt er, and freer, however, we are more likely to adopt an “always on” approach to media. Our broadband connections—whether in our homes or in our phones—keep our applications on, updating, and ready at every moment. Anytime anyone or anything wants to message, email, tweet, update, notify, or alert us, something dings on our desktop or vibrates in our pocket. Our devices and, by extension, our nervous systems are now att ached to the entire online universe, all the time. Is that my phone vibrating? We scramble to keep up with the never-ending infl ow of demands and commands, under the false premise that moving faster will allow us to get out from under the endless stream of pings for our att ention. For answering email and responding to texts or tweets only exacerbates the problem by leading to more responses to our responses, and so on."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"29 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED We strive to multitask, att empting to give partial att ention to more than one thing at a time, when all we really do is move as quickly as possible from one task to another. No matt er how profi cient we think we are at multitasking, studies show [1] our ability to accomplish tasks accurately and completely only diminishes the more we try to do at the same time. This is not the fault of digital technology, but the way we use it. Instead of our going online to get our email, our email comes to us. Instead of using our inbox as an asynchronous holding bin, we stick it into our phones, which are sure to thump, ding, or shudder with each new incoming message— just to make sure we know something wants our att ention. We work against the powerful bias of a timeless technology, and create a situation in which it is impossible to keep up. And so we sacrifi ce the thoughtf ulness and deliberateness our digital media once off ered for the false goal of immediacy—as if we really can exist in a state of perpetual standby. The results aren’t prett y. Instead of becoming empowered and aware, we become frazzled and exhausted. We have no time to make considered responses, feeling instead obligated to reply to every incoming message on impulse. We reduce the length and complexity of our responses from paragraphs to sentences to txts, making almost everything 1. E. Ophir, C. Nass, and A. D.

Everything must happen right away or, bett er, now. There is no later. This works against the no-time bias of digital media, and so it works against us, even though it might work for the phone company programming the device and inducing our dependence and compliance. (Yes, each variety of beep is studied and tested for its ability to entrain our behavior.) It’s not that the net has somehow changed from an asynchronous medium to a synchronous one. No, it’s all still just commands existing in a sequence, outside time. But those commands are coming at us now in increasingly rapid bursts, stimulating us to respond at rates incompatible with human thought and emotion—and in ways that are not terribly enjoyable. Try as we might, we are slow to adapt to the random fl ood of pings. And our nervous systems are not happy with this arrangement. For the fi rst time, regular people are beginning to show the signs of stress and mental fatigue once exclusive to air traffi c controllers and 911 operators. Cell phone users now complain of “phantom vibration syndrome,” the sensation of a cell phone vibrating on your thigh, even though there’s no phone in your pocket. Yet this very discomfort and anxiety compels us to seek still more: The possibility of one great email from a friend, or one good contract off er somewhere down in that list of unanswered messages keeps us compulsively checking our"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"31 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED inboxes, iPhones and BlackBerrys like classically conditioned gamblers at the slot machines. And, perhaps counterintuitively, the faster we empty our inbox, the faster it fi lls up again. Every answered email spawns more. The quicker we respond, the more of an expectation we create that we will respond that rapidly again. An email chain becomes like a conversation happening in real time—except much less effi ciently than a phone call. The slower we respond—the more we do the net on our own schedule instead of the one we think it is imposing on us—the more respect we command from the people on the other side of the screen. Unfortunately, many of us don’t feel we have even the right to dictate our own relationship to the incoming digital traffi c. Of course, the simplest way out is to refuse to be always on. To engage with the digital—to connect to the network— can still be a choice rather than a given. That’s the very defi nition of autonomy. We can choose to whom or what we want to be available, and when. And we can even choose people for whom we want to be always on. Being open to a call from a family member 24/7 doesn’t require being open to everyone. The time it takes to program your phone to ring for only certain incoming numbers is trivial compared to the time wasted answering calls from people you don’t want to hear from.

We mistake the rapid-fi re stimulus of our networks for immediacy, and the moment we are actually living in for the thing that needs to catch up. We are like drivers trying to catch up with the image in the rearview mirror. And the more we live this way, the more we value the digital’s defi nition of the now. Our search engines preface their more relevant results with a section of “live” links to whatever blog comment, social networking message, or tweet has most recently been posted containing the words in our queries. The only weighting that matt ers is how few seconds have transpired since it was blurted. This in turn encourages us to value the recent over the relevant. While media critics and concerned educators lament the eff ects of short messaging on brain capacity, the real infl uence of our interaction with these programs is not on our neurons as much as our habits and outlook. Yes, thanks to what is known as neuroplasticity, our brains do change depending on what we do. A brain learning on computers ends up wired diff erently than a brain learning on textbooks. This is nothing new. Brains learning through text are diff erent than ones that learned through oral teaching, too. Likewise, a kid who plays mostly with dolls ends up wired diff erently than one who builds bridges with blocks. There’s a misplaced anxiety here. Our brains adapt to diff erent situations.

Wearing fur allowed us to shed our own. Likewise, text changed the way we process and remember information, and television changed the way our brains relate to three- dimensional space. Digital media now extends some of these trajectories, while adding a few of its own. The outsourcing of our memory to machines expands the amount of data to which we have access, but degrades our brain’s own ability to remember things. Yet this process of offl oading our remembered information began with the invention of text, and met with similar critique even back then. We have been consistently using our brains less as hard drives and more as processors— putt ing our mental resources into active RAM. What’s diff erent now, however, is that it’s not just lists, dates, and recipes that are being stored for us, but entire processes. The processes we used to use for fi nding a doctor or a friend, mapping a route, or choosing a restaurant are being replaced by machines that may, in fact, do it bett er. What we lose in the bargain, however, is not just the ability to remember certain facts, but to call upon certain skills. We encode a way of doing something and if the computer is capable of accomplishing that task, we never need to know how it happens again. It’s a bit like doing arithmetic by algorithm, which most of us learned for calculating square roots and long division. We learn how to push the numbers"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"34 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF through a series of rote steps to get our answer, but forget how or why it really works. Now we’re having our computers remember those processes, which removes us one step further from whatever is going on. So instead of simply offl oading our memory to external hard drives, we’re beginning to offl oad our thinking as well. And thinking is not like a book you can pick up when you want to, in your own time. It is something that’s always on. Are we choosing to surrender the ability to do it without digital assistance? If so, are we prepared to remain connected to our networks all the time? What new ability, if any, are we making room for in the process? It’s not the networking of the dendrites in our skulls that matt ers so much as how eff ective and happy we are living that way and, in the case of digital media, how purposefully we get ourselves there. Recognizing the biases of the technologies we bring into our lives is really the only way to stay aware of the ways we are changing in order to accommodate them, and to gauge whether we are happy with that arrangement. Rather than accepting each tool’s needs as a necessary compromise in our passively technologized lifestyles, we can instead exploit those very same leanings to make ourselves more human. Our computers live in the ticks of the clock. We live in the big spaces between those ticks, when the time actually passes. By becoming “always on,” we surrender time to a technology that knows and needs no such thing."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" II. PLACE Live in Person Digital networks are decentralized technologies. They work from far away, exchanging intimacy for distance.

The popular urban high school senior has over fi ve hundred followers on Twitt er (most of them real people) reading her every post to fi nd out where the action is tonight. I’m trailing her, along with a youth culture trendspott er, to see what she does on a typical Friday night: how she makes her decisions, and how she communicates them to her ever-growing posse of followers. Gina is a trendsett er, a social leader, and a creature of the moment—in more ways than one. She’s at a club on the Upper East Side, but seems oblivious to the boys and the music. Instead of engaging with those around her, she’s scrolling through text messages on her phone, from friends at other parties, bars, and clubs throughout New York. She needs to know if the event she’s at is “the event to be at,” or whether something bett er is happening at that very moment, somewhere else. Sure enough, a blip on display catches her interest, and in what seems like seconds we’re in a cab headed for the East Village. We arrive at a seemingly identical party, but it’s the one that Gina has decided is “the place to be” tonight. Instead of turning the phone off and enjoying herself, however, she turns her phone around, activates the camera, and proceeds to take pictures of herself and her friends—instantly uploading them to her Facebook page for the world to see. She does this for about an hour, until a message comes through one of her"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"37 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED networks and she’s off to the next location for the cycle to begin all over again. Gina is the girl who is everywhere at once, yet— ultimately—nowhere at all. She is already violating the fi rst command by maintaining an “always on” relationship to her devices and networks. This has in turn fostered her manic, compulsive need to keep tabs on everything everyone else is doing at all times. It has not only removed her from linear time, however, but also from physical place. She relates to her friends through the network, while practically ignoring whomever she is with at the moment. She relates to the places and people she is actually with only insofar as they are suitable for transmission to others in remote locations. The most social girl in her class doesn’t really socialize in the real world at all. While the intent of digital networks was not to disconnect a high school girl from her real world friendships, the bias of the networks were absolutely intended to favor decentralized activity. Aft er all, the net was developed as a communications platf orm capable of withstanding nuclear att ack. Messages—whether text, audio, or video—move through the network as “packets,” each taking diff erent routes from node to node until they fi nd their destination. The network is still controlled centrally by an authority (we’ll get to this later), but it functions in a decentralized way.

For the bias of media has always been toward distance— that’s part of what media are for. Text allowed a person in one place (usually a king with a messenger running on foot) to send a message to a person in another place. To those with the power of the writt en word, what was happening far away became actionable, or even changeable. Similarly, broadcast media gave the newly minted national brands of the industrial age a way to communicate their value across great distances. Where a customer may have once depended on a personal relationship with a local merchant, now he could relate instead to the messaging of a nationally advertised product. As the promoters of distance over the local, media have also promoted the agendas of long-distance interests over those of people in localities. Sometimes this is a great thing. It allows an entire nation to rally around an issue or idea, forces everyone to notice an injustice that might be happening far away, and even shows how all people are on some level the same. This bias toward non-local thinking can be threatening to parochial interests, and explains much of the origins of resentment for the Judeo-Christian tradition and its text-"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"39 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED inspired emphasis on a universal deity and ethics over the local gods and laws of particular regions. Likewise, big media and the corporations paying them became the enemy of local companies and their workers. Technology and media traditionally worked to make commerce more global, favoring big business over local interests. Mass production distanced workers from the value they were creating. Instead of making a product from beginning to end, each worker on an assembly line completed one small task in the overall process. The product moves from person to person—or even nation to nation—as it is assembled. Each person means less to the production cycle. One’s skill level becomes less important as repeatable processes replace craft smanship and expertise. Workers become cheaper and replaceable, while corporate pricing power puts local companies out of business. Towns become ever more dependent on foreign-owned factories for employment. Mass-produced products require mass marketing to sell them. Instead of buying oats from Bob the miller, people—now “consumers”—were to purchase them from a big company a thousand miles away in Ohio. The face of a Quaker on the package helped to re-create the kind of bond people used to enjoy with the fellow community members with whom they previously exchanged goods. Finally, a mass media arose to promote these long-distance brand images to an entire nation. Through radio and television, non-local companies could"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"40 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF seed a market with their brands and mythologies before the package even made it to the shelf. Mass media became the non-local brand’s way of competing against the people with whom we actually worked and lived. Local businesses competed against both national brands and retail chains for local dollars—and mass media favored mass production and mass marketing over local production and community relationships. The value of transactions became limited to what could be measured in dollars, and ended at the moment of sale. All of the social value of the exchange was lost—and the money itself left the community. This trend reinforced itself as people— embarrassed to have abandoned a local business for the big box store—began to spend less time on Main Street or at local functions where they might run into local merchants. Local bonds deteriorated, and formerly productive towns turned into bedroom communities of commuters. While cable television and, now, Internet marketing give smaller businesses a way to peddle their wares in the same media as their corporate counterparts, it may actually work against their real strength as real world, local companies. The power of a local business—or any local enterprise—is its connection to a particular region and people. Its locality is its strength. By turning to a decentralized medium to engage with people right around the corner, a local business loses its home fi eld advantage. Its"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"41 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED banner ads will never look as good as those coming out of a marketing agency anyway. To be sure, one can use the net to organize a local group, schedule a meet-up, or get parents to a school board meeting. But in each of these cases, the non-local bias of the net is accepted as a means to an end: We go online in order to communicate with people who are not with us at that moment, and hopefully to arrange a time and place to meet for real. Further, for people who already know each other well in real life to engage online is very diff erent than engaging with strangers we know only online. The net can reinforce real world relationships when those relationships already exist. Interactive technology has also allowed for conversations to take place in a media landscape that formerly promoted only one-way broadcast. For those of us living in a world already disconnected by mass marketing and media, these litt le pings can be very real, and very compelling. A mediaspace that used to make us feel utt erly alone now connects us to anyone, anywhere. For some, this means fi nding other people like themselves for the very fi rst time. Survivors of rare cancers can fi nd support groups, gay kids can fi nd people who have lived through being the only “out” student in a high school, and fans of esoteric books or music can fi nd global communities willing to discuss what no one else in their lives even knows exists. But those back-and-forth exchanges are occurring at a"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"42 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF distance. They are bett er than nothing—particularly for people in unique situations—but they are not a replacement for real interaction. In fact, the ease with which a simulated, digital connection is made can oft en make us more distant. The homebound geriatric now has an easy way to connect to her church “virtually” every Sunday morning—and parishioners don’t have to worry about who is going to her home to transport her and her wheelchair that week. It takes less eff ort, but it’s also less benefi cial for everybody concerned. Giving and accepting kindness used to be part of package. Similarly, digital technologies can bring news and pictures to us from far away, instantaneously and constantly. We can watch live feed of the oil from an underwater well leaking into the ocean, or a cell phone video of an activist gett ing murdered in the street by a dictator’s police. But with litt le more to do about than blog from the safety of our bedrooms, such imagery tends to disconnect and desensitize us rather than engage us fully. Besides, it’s “over there” somewhere. Meanwhile, what is happening just outside our window is devalued. As we come to depend on the net for our sense of connection to each other and the world, we end up fetishizing the tools through which all this happens. We associate our computer screens and email accounts with our most profound experiences of community and connection, and mistake blog comments sections for our most signifi cant conversations."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"43 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED And so we begin to use long-distance technologies by default, even in local situations where face-to-face contact would be easier. I’ll never forget being proudly escorted by a college administrator to a classroom that had been used for a model United Nations for the past ten years. This year, however, they were doing things diff erently: Instead of having the students re-create the General Assembly in their classroom, they would do it in an online simulation called Second Life. When I got to the room, I saw forty students sitt ing at desks outf itt ed with high-resolution computer screens. Although the students were all in the same place at the same time, they were not looking at one another, but at the monitors on their desks. On the monitors was an approximation of a room very much like the one they were in—but without the computers. A simulation like this might be great for students of an online university to engage more fully with one another, or for students from around the world to experience something like the United Nations without having to travel. But for students and a school who have already spent the time, money, and energy to get to a real classroom at a real college, why throw all that away for video game version of engagement?

What they can’t seem to grasp is that I could just as easily deliver a digital slide show live from the comfort of my home via broadband Internet. There’s no need to fl y a human body two thousand miles for that. No, the reason to spend the jet fuel to bring a human body across a country or an ocean is for the full-spectrum communication that occurs between human beings in real spaces with one another. The digital slideshow, in most cases, is a distraction—distancing people from one another by mediating their interaction with electronic data. This misguided tendency to depend on long-distance technology to enhance up-close encounters is completely understandable and forgivable. The more connected we feel in digital spaces, the less securely connected many of us feel in real ones. Aft er days or weeks connecting with people through video chats, the sensation of someone’s eyes actually looking into our own in real life can be overwhelming and disorienting. Similarly, aft er years of understanding our businesses as brands whose values can be communicated entirely in an ad, it’s only natural for us to lose sight of what it means to run an enterprise in a particular place.

Many businesses—particularly the biggest ones—already exist in a non-local reality. The entire history of industrial corporatism, from colonial empires to the railroad barons of the nineteenth century, depended on disconnecting people from their local strength and commanding them from afar. For them, it is just as ridiculous to use the net to feign that they are local enterprises as it is for local enterprises to use it to act in the manner of national brands. Powerful global companies become weak local ones, while promising local companies become weak global players. The digital age off ers us all the opportunity to recognize the dislocating bias of our interactive media. With that knowledge, we may choose when we wish to live and work in real places, with one another and—unique to living humans— in person."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" III. CHOICE You May Always Choose None of the Above In the digital realm, everything is made into a choice. The medium is biased toward the discrete. This oft en leaves out things we have not chosen to notice or record, and forces choices when none need to be made. The diff erence between an analog record and a digital CD is really quite simple. The record is the artifact of a real event"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"47 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED that happened in a particular time and place. A musician plays an instrument while, nearby, a needle cuts a groove in a wax disk (or disturbs the electrons on a magnetic tape). The sound vibrates the needle, leaving a physical record of the noise that can be turned into a mold and copied. When someone else passes a needle over the jagged groove on one of the copies, the original sound emerges. No one has to really know anything about the sound for this to work. It’s just a physical event—an impression left in matt er. A CD, on the other hand, is not a physical artifact but a symbolic representation. It’s more like text than it is like sound. A computer is programmed to measure various parameters of the sound coming from a musician’s instrument. The computer assigns numerical values, many times a second, to the sound in an eff ort to represent it mathematically. Once the numerical— or “digital”—equivalent of the recording is quantifi ed, it can be transferred to another computer, which then synthesizes the music from scratch based on those numbers. The analog recording is a physical impression, while the digital recording is a series of choices. The former is as smooth and continuous as real time; the latt er is a series of numerical snapshots. The record has as much fi delity as the materials will allow. The CD has as much fi delity as the people programming its creation thought to allow. The numbers used to represent the song—the digital fi le—is perfect, at least on its own terms. It can be copied exactly, and infi nitely."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"48 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF In the digital recording, however, only the dimensions of the sound that can be measured and represented in numbers are taken into account. Any dimensions that the recording engineers haven’t taken into consideration are lost. They are simply not measured, writt en down, stored, and reproduced. It’s not as if they can be rediscovered later on some upgraded playback device. They are gone. Given how convincingly real a digital recording can seem—especially in comparison with a scratchy record— this loss may seem trivial. Aft er all, if we can’t hear it, how important could it be? Most of us have decided it’s not so important at all. But early tests of analog recordings compared to digital ones revealed that music played back on a CD format had much less of a positive impact on depressed patients than the same recording played back on a record. Other tests showed that digitally recorded sound moved the air in a room signifi cantly diff erently than analog recordings played through the same speakers. The bodies in that room would, presumably, also experience that diff erence—even if we humans can’t immediately put a name or metric on exactly what that diff erence is. So digital audio engineers go back and increase the sampling rates, look to measure things about the sound they didn’t measure before, and try again. If the sampling rate and frequency range are “beyond the capability of the human ear” then it is presumed the problem is solved. But the problem is"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"49 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED not that the digital recording is not good enough—it is that it’s a fundamentally diff erent phenomenon from the analog one. The analog really just happens—the same way the hands of a clock move slowly around the dial, passing over the digits in one smooth motion. The digital recording is more like a digital clock, making absolute and discrete choices about when those seconds are changing from one to the next. These choices—these artifi cially segmented decision points—appear very real to us. They are so commanding, so absolute. Nothing in the real world is so very discrete, however. We can’t even decide when life begins and ends, much less when a breath is complete or when the decay of a musical note’s echo has truly ended—if it ever does. Every translation of a real thing to the symbolic realm of the digital requires that such decisions be made. The digital realm is biased toward choice, because everything must be expressed in the terms of a discrete, yes- or-no, symbolic language. This, in turn, oft en forces choices on humans operating within the digital sphere . We must come to recognize the increased number of choices in our lives as largely a side eff ect of the digital; we always have the choice of making no choice at all. All this real and illusory choice—all these unnecessary decision points—may indeed be a dream come true for marketers desperate to convince us that our every consumer preference matt ers. But it’s not their fault. They are merely"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"50 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF exploiting digital technology’s pre-existing bias for yes-or-no decisions. Aft er all, the very architecture of the digital is numbers; every fi le, picture, song, movie, program, and operating system is just a number. (Open a video or picture of a loved one in your text editor to see it, if you’re interested.) And to the computer, that number is actually represented as a series of 1’s and 0’s. There’s nothing in between that 1 and 0, since a computer or switch is either on or off . All the messy stuff in between yes and no, on and off , just doesn’t travel down wires, through chips, or in packets. For something to be digital, it has to be expressed in digits. It’s in that translation from the blurry and nondescript real world of people and perceptions to the absolutely defi ned and numerical world of the digital where something might be lost. Exactly where in the spectrum between yellow and red is that strange shade of orange? 491 terahertz? A litt le more? 491.5? 0.6? Somewhere in between? How exact is enough? That’s anyone’s call, but what must be acknowledged fi rst is that someone is, indeed, calling it. A choice is being made. This isn’t a bad thing; it’s just how computers work. It’s up to the cyborg philosophers of the future to tell us whether everything in reality is just information, reducible to long strings of just two digits. The issue here is that even if our world is made of pure information, we don’t yet know enough about that data to record it. We don’t know all the information,"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"51 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED or how to measure it. For now, our digital representations are compromises—symbol systems that record or transmit a great deal about what matt ers to us at any given moment. Bett er digital technology merely makes those choices at increasingly granular levels. And while our computers are busy making discrete choices about the rather indiscrete and subtle world in which we live, many of us are busy, too—accommodating our computers by living and defi ning ourselves in their terms. We are making choices not because we want to, but because our programs demand them. For instance, information online is stored in databases. A database is really just a list—but the computer or program has to be able to be able to parse and use what’s inside the list. This means someone—the programmer—must choose what questions will be asked and what options the user will have in responding: Man or Woman? Married or Single? Gay or Straight? It gets very easy to feel left out. Or old: 0–12, 13–19, 20–34, 35–48, or 49–75? The architecture of databases requires the programmer to pick the categories that matt er, and at the granularity that matt ers to his or his employer’s purpose. As users, all we see is a world of choice—and isn’t choice good? Here are one hundred possible looks for your mail browser, twenty possible dispositions each with twenty subsets for you to defi ne yourself on a dating site, one hundred options for you to confi gure your car, life insurance,"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"52 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF or sneaker. When it doesn’t feel overwhelming, it feels prett y empowering—at least for a while. More choice is a good thing, right? We equate it with more freedom, autonomy, self- determination, and democracy. But it turns out more choice doesn’t really do all this. We all want the freedom to choose, and the history of technology can easily be told as the story of how human beings gave themselves more choices: the choice to live in diff erent climates, to spend our time doing things other than hunting for food, to read at night, and so on. Still, there’s a value set att ending all this choice, and the one choice we’re not gett ing to make is whether or not to deal with all this choice. Choice stops us, requiring that we make a decision in order to move on. Choice means selecting one option while lett ing all the others go. Imagine having to choose your college major before taking a single course. Each option passed over is an opportunity cost—both real and imagined. The more choices we make (or are forced to make) the more we believe our expectations will be met. But in actual experience, our pursuit of choice has the eff ect of making us less engaged, more obsessive, less free, and more controlled. And forced choice is no choice at all, whether for a hostage forced to choose which of her children can survive, or a social network user forced to tell the world whether she is married or single. Digital technology’s bias toward forced choices dovetails all too neatly with our roles as consumers, reinforcing this"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"53 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED notion of choice as somehow liberating while turning our interactive lives into fodder for consumer research. Websites and programs become laboratories where our keystrokes and mouse clicks are measured and compared, our every choice registered for its ability to predict and infl uence the next choice. The more we accept each approximation as accurate, the more we reinforce these techniques from our machines and their programmers. Whether it’s an online bookstore suggesting books based on our previous selections (and those of thousands of other consumers with similar choice histories), or a consumer research fi rm using kids’ social networking behaviors to predict which ones will someday self-identify as gay (yes, they can do that now), choice is less about giving people what they want than gett ing them to take what the choice-giver has to sell. Meanwhile, the more we learn to conform to the available choices, the more predictable and machinelike we become ourselves. We train ourselves to stay between the lines, like an image dragged onto a “snap-to” grid: It never stays quite where we put it, but jerks up and over to the closest available place on the predetermined map. Likewise, through our series of choices about the news we read, feeds to which we subscribe, and websites we visit, we create a choice fi lter around ourselves. Friends and feeds we may have chosen arbitrarily or because we were forced"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"54 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF to in the past soon become the markers through which our programs and search engines choose what to show us next. Our choices narrow our world, as the infi nity of possibility is lost in the translation to binary code. One emerging alternative to forced, top-down choice in the digital realm is “tagging.” Instead of a picture, blog entry, or anything being entirely defi ned by its predetermined category, users who come upon it are free (but not obligated) to label it themselves with a tag. The more people who tag it a certain way, the more easily others looking for something with that tag will fi nd it. While traditional databases are not biased toward categorizing things in an open-ended, bott om-up fashion, they are capable of operating this way. They needn’t be limited by the original choices programmed into them but can be programmed instead to expand their dimensions and categories based on the tags and preferences of the people using them. They can be made to conform to the way people think, instead of demanding we think like they do. It’s all in the programming, and in our awareness of how these technologies will be biased if we do not intervene consciously in their implementation. Meanwhile, we are always free to withhold choice, resist categorization, or even go for something not on the list of available options. You may always choose none of the above. Withholding choice is not death. Quite on the contrary, it is one of the few things distinguishing life from its digital imitators."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" IV. COMPLEXITY You Are Never Completely Right Although they allowed us to work with certain kinds of complexity in the fi rst place, our digital tools oft en oversimplify nuanced problems.

By acknowledging the bias of the digital toward a reduction of complexity, we regain the ability to treat its simulations as models occurring in a vacuum rather than accurate depictions of our world. Thanks to its fi rst three biases, digital technology encourages us to make decisions, make them in a hurry, and make them about things we’ve never seen for ourselves up close. Furthermore, because these choices must all be expressed in numbers, they are only accurate to the nearest decimal place. They are approximations by necessity. But they are also absolute: At the end of the day, digital technologies are saying either yes or no. This makes digital technology—and those of us using it—biased toward a reduction of complexity . For instance, although reality is more than one level deep, most of our digital networks are accessible with a single web search. All knowledge is the same distance away—just once removed from where we are now. Instead of pursuing a line of inquiry, treading a well-worn path or striking out on an entirely new one, we put a search term in a box and get back more results than we can possibly read.

The acquisition of knowledge used to mean pursuing a prescribed path and then gett ing to the knowledge desired when the path reached there. The seeker had to jump through the hoops left by his predecessors. Now, the seeker can just get the answer. And in some cases—many cases even—this is a terrifi c thing. A cancer patient doesn’t need ten years of medical training to read about a particular course of chemotherapy, a citizen doesn’t need a law degree to study how a new tax code might aff ect his business, a student doesn’t need to read all of Romeo and Juliet to be able to answer questions about it on a test. (Well, at least it feels like a great thing at the time.) We only get into trouble if we equate such cherry-picked knowledge with the kind one gets pursuing a genuine inquiry. In today’s harried net culture, actually sitt ing down to read an entire Wikipedia article on a subject—especially aft er we’ve found the single fact we need—seems like a luxury.

Rather, it was generally understood that these watered-down digests of knowledge deny a person the learning that takes place along the way. Actually reading the scenes in a Shakespeare play, or following the process through which Mendel inferred genetics from the variations in his garden pea plants, promotes experiential learning. It re-creates the process of discovery, putt ing the researcher through the very motion of cognition rather than simply delivering the bounty. Is this an old-fashioned way of acquiring knowledge? Indeed it is. And it’s not essential for every single fact we might need. Figuring out the sales tax rate in Tennessee needn’t require us to revisit the evolution of the state’s tax code. Thank heavens there’s an Internet making such information a single search away. But not everything is a data point. Yes, thanks to the digital archive we can retrieve any piece of data on our own terms, but we do so at the risk of losing its context. Our knee-jerk, digital age reaction against academic disciplines fi nds its footing in our resentment for centuries of repressive hierarchies. Professors, gurus, and pundits made us pay for access to their knowledge, in one way or another. Still, although they may have abused their monopolies, some of the journeys on which they sent us were valid.

We are no longer part of that bigger project, or even know what it is we are rejecting. In the more immediate sense, facts devoid of context are almost impossible to apply sensibly. They become the fodder for falsely constructed arguments of one side or other of the social or political spectrum. The single vote of a politician is used to describe his entire record, a single positive att ribute of caff eine or tobacco receives att ention thanks to public relations funding, and a picture of a single wounded child turns public opinion against one side in a confl ict rather than against war itself. Both sides in a debate can cherry-pick the facts that suit them—enraging their constituencies and polarizing everybody. In a digital culture that values data points over context, everyone comes to believe they have the real answer and that the other side is crazy or evil. Once they reach this point, it no longer matt ers that the opposing side’s facts contradict one’s own: True believers push through to a new level of cynicism where if the facts are contradictory, it means they are all irrelevant. The abundance of facts ends up reducing their value to us. As a result, we tend to retreat into tribes, guided primarily by our uninformed rage. And we naturally hunger for reinforcement.

Elected offi cials are ridiculed as “wonks” for sharing or even understanding multiple viewpoints, the history of an issue, or its greater context. We forget that these are the people we’re paying to learn about these issues on our behalf. Instead, we overvalue our own opinions on issues about which we are ill informed, and undervalue those who are telling us things that are actually more complex than they look on the surface. They become the despised “elite.” Appropriately used, however, the data-point universe can yield uniquely valuable connections and insights. Thousands or millions of amateurs, working through problems together or independently, can link to one another’s results and sources. Instead of depending on a top-down academic discipline (which may be more committ ed to the preservation of old heroes than the solving of new problems), researchers can discern which sources are most valuable to their peers right now. Information can be structured and restructured in real time, catered to new challenges unforeseen by yesterday’s academics. Physics and biology no longer need to live in diff erent departments of the university, and James Joyce can appear on the same virtual library shelf as a text on chaos math. In a hypertext-driven information space, everybody’s library can look diff erent every day.

This is your brain’s way of organizing some pieces of information for a very particular task. It is not a substitute for knowledge of that realm. It is just a new entry point. Which is not to suggest this way of approaching information isn’t quite novel or even powerful. Young people, in particular, are developing the ability to get the gist of an entire area of study with just a moment of interaction with it. With a channel surfer’s skill, they are able to experience a book, movie, or even a scientifi c process almost intuitively. For them, hearing a few lines of T. S. Eliot, seeing one geometric proof, or looking at a picture of an African mask leaves them with a real, albeit oversimplifi ed, impression of the world from which it comes. This works especially well for areas of art and study that are “fractal” or holographic in nature, where one tiny piece refl ects the essence of the whole. By recognizing that our engagements through and with the digital world tend to reduce the complexity of our real world, we lessen the risk of equating these oversimplifi ed impressions with real knowledge and experience. The digital information gatherer tends to have the opposite approach to knowledge as his text-based ancestors, who saw research as an excuse to sit and read old books. Instead, net research is more about engaging with data in order to dismiss it and move on— like a magazine one fl ips through not to read, but to make sure there’s nothing that has to be read. Reading becomes a process"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"62 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF of elimination rather than deep engagement. Life becomes about knowing how not to know what one doesn’t have to know. Ironically, perhaps, as our digital experiences make us more simple, our machines are only gett ing more complex. The more complex our technologies become, and more impenetrable their decision-making (especially by our increasingly simplifi ed, gist-of-it brains), the more dependent on them we become. Their very complexity becomes the new anxiety, replacing the adman’s storytelling as the predominant form of social infl uence. While digital technology liberated us from our roles as passive spectators of media, their simplifying bias reduced us once again to passive spectators of technology itself. For most of us, the announcement of the next great “iThing” provokes not eagerness but anxiety: Is this something else we will have to pay for and learn to use? Do we even have a choice? With each upgrade in technology, our experience of the world is further reduced in complexity. The more advanced and predictive the smart-phone interface, the less a person needs to know to use it—or how it even makes its decisions. Instead of learning about our technology, we opt for a world in which our technology learns about us .

Again, this is only a problem if we mistake our digital models for reality. Restaurant recommendations, mapping functions, and stock tickers are ways of understanding worlds—not the worlds themselves. But the latest research into virtual worlds suggests that the lines between the two may be blurring. A Stanford scientist testing kids’ memories of virtual reality experiences has found that at least half of children cannot distinguish between what they really did and what they did in the computer simulation. [2] Two weeks aft er donning headsets and swimming with virtual whales, half of the participants interviewed believed they had actually had the real world experience. Likewise, Philip Rosedale—the quite sane founder of the virtual reality community Second Life— told me he believes that by 2020, his online world will be indistinguishable from real life. 2.

As we know even personally, our time spent looking into screens harms our eyesight, wearing earbuds harms our hearing, and crouching over a keyboard harms our ability to move. Digital simulations also have their own eff ect on our perceptual apparatus. The sound-fi le format used in most digital music players, MP3, is really just an algorithm. The MP3 algorithm takes digital audio fi les (themselves just numbers) and reduces them even further to save space. The algorithm was developed to simulate the main features of sound that reverberate in people’s ears. The MP3 algorithm has a way of creating the sensation of bass, the sensation of high notes, and so on. Listening to these fi les in lieu of music, however, seems to strain or even retrain our hearing. As new and disturbing studies in Germany have shown, [3] young people raised on 3.

This shouldn’t diminish the brilliance and importance of these simulation technologies, or the many ways computer scientists have learned to approximate reality through them. While they are poor substitutes for the full spectrum of nature, they are great models for particular systems that we would have no way to isolate from their contexts in the real world. A weather system can be studied purely in terms of pressure zones, a fi nancial market can be analyzed through the axes of supply and demand, and a digital map can represent the world in terms of wealth, violence, or real-time births. Because digital simulations are numerical models, many choices about them must be made in advance. Models are necessarily reductive. They are limited by design. This does not negate their usefulness; it merely qualifi es it. Digital reduction yields maps. These maps are great for charting a course, but they are not capable of providing the journey.

SCALE One Size Does Not Fit All On the net, everything scales—or at least it’s supposed to.

He hired a local college student to build him a website, complete with a shopping cart and checkout. He soon discovered that his online transactions were less expensive than the ones he did in real life. For web customers, he didn’t have to maintain a physical store—and didn’t even have to purchase stock or pay shipping. One of the big delivery companies took care of fulfi llment, and sent orders directly from the manufacturers to Tom’s customers. Tom began encouraging his walk-in customers to use the site, going so far as to put a laptop on the counter of the store. Aft er a few months, he gave up the physical shop altogether and—at the advice of supposedly net-savvy friends like me— Tom spent his time writing a music blog to characterize his business and share his expertise online. Along came “shopping aggregators”—programs that sweep through the net for the best prices on any product— and there went Tom’s margins. His prices were good, but he couldn’t compete with the chain stores. When his off erings showed up in the same list as the other stores but just a couple of dollars higher, even his loyal customers went elsewhere. People still read his blog, but bought from his cheaper, bigger competitors. The fact that he was no longer a live human interacting face-to-face with another community member didn’t help matt ers. What’s the diff erence between one"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"68 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF web page and another, anyway? It’s all in the same browser window. Tom’s error wasn’t just that he closed down his sustainable local business; it was that he couldn’t scale. On the net, everything is occurring on the same abstracted and universal level. Survival in a purely digital realm— particularly in business—means being able to scale, and winning means being able to move up one level of abstraction beyond everyone else . The music retailers that could scale eff ectively survived the net; the companies that went up a level and aggregated those music retailers triumphed. The net has turned scalability from a business option to a business requirement. Real world companies have always generally had the choice of whether they want to remain at the “mom and pop” level, or to become a chain or franchise— essentially going into the business of business. Beginning the 1970s, shopping malls and big box stores changed the retail landscape, putt ing the pressure of internationally scaled competition onto local businesses. By the 1990s, migrating to the net seemed to many like a way to fi ght back: No website seemed to be intrinsically advantaged over another. Now the smallest players could have the same reach as the big boys. But as Tom learned, going online also denied him his remaining competitive advantage, the human relationships and local connections he enjoyed in the real world. Instead, going online forced him into the electronic mall itself—a place"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"69 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED where he was no longer capable of competing on any level. Even his store’s blog and recommendations were consumed as if they were completely disconnected from his own stock and cash register. The fact that his insights could be searched and retrieved by content aggregators didn’t help keep his expertise associated with his own merchandise. Because the net is occurring on a single, oversimplifi ed and generic level, success has less to do with fi nding a niche than establishing a “vertical” or a “horizontal.” Going vertical means establishing oneself as the place to do everything in a particular industry: the one-stop place for hardware, or cycling needs, or home electronics. Going horizontal means to off er a service that applies to every category’s transactions, like the company that made the credit card transaction soft ware for Tom’s music website. In either case, “scaling up” means cutt ing through the entire cloud in one direction or another: becoming all things to some people, or some things to all people. The craft iest online businesspeople have come to realize that neither of those strategies is perfect. Both vertical and horizontal businesses face competition from their peers in an increasingly commodifi ed landscape. It’s almost impossible to establish a foothold that can’t get undercut by a tiny shift in the price of one component. So instead of going into business, these players become search engines, portals, or aggregators, rising one level above all those competing businesses and skimming profi t off the top. In an abstracted universe where"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"70 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF everything is fl oating up in the same cloud, it is the indexer who provides context and direction. Of course, this logic dovetails perfectly with a fi nancial industry in which derivatives on transactions matt er more than the transactions themselves. Once the fi nancial world came to understand that its own medium—central currency—was biased in the interests of the lender and not the producer, every business att empted to get out of the business it was actually in, and scale up to become a holding company. Thus, great industrial companies like General Electric shed their factories and got involved in capital leasing, banking, and commercial credit. Meanwhile, those who were already in banking and credit moved up one level of abstraction as well, opening hedge funds and creating derivatives instruments that won or lost money based on the movements of economic activity occurring one level below. Even craft ier speculators began writing derivatives of derivatives, and so on, and so on. The existing bias of business toward abstraction combined with the net’s new emphasis on success through scale yielded a digital economy with almost no basis in actual commerce, the laws of supply and demand, or the creation of value. It’s not capitalism in the traditional sense, but an abstracted hyper-capitalism utt erly divorced from gett ing anything done. In fact, the closer to the creation of value you get under this scheme, the farther you are from the money.

The emergent behavior of slime mold becomes the justifi cation for the consciousness of the market and fractal geometry is misused to prove that the economic behavior occurring on one level of society is mirrored on all the others. All of these new perspectives relied on the very same digitally determined axiom that everything can and should be abstracted from everything else. What all this abstraction does accomplish here on earth, however, is make everyone and everything more dependent on highly centralized standards. Instead of granting power to small businesses on the periphery, the net ends up granting even more authority to the central authorities, indexers, aggregators, and currencies through which all activity must pass. Without the search engine, we are lost. Without centrally directed domain name servers, the search engines are lost. Further, since digital content itself needs to be coded and decoded, it requires tremendous standardization from the outset. Far from liberating people and their ideas from hierarchies, the digital realm enforces central control on an entirely new level. On a more subtle level, the abstraction intrinsic to the digital universe makes us rely more heavily on familiar brands and trusted authorities to gain our bearings. Like tourists in a foreign city sighing in relief at the sight of a Starbucks or American Express sign, users tend to depend more on centrally"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"72 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF defi ned themes and instantly recognizable brands. They are like signposts, even for the young people we consider digital natives, who turn out to be even more reliant on brand names and accepted standards for understanding and orientation than are their digital immigrant counterparts. Activism means fi nding a website, joining a movement, or “liking” a cause— all of which exist on a plane above and beyond their human members. Learning, orienting, and belonging online depend on universally accepted symbols or generically accessible institutions. Likewise, achievement is equated with becoming one of those universal symbols oneself. The digitally oriented activist is no longer satisfi ed with making something real happen where she lives but, rather, dedicated to building the website that solves the problem for everyone. Everyone wants to have his or her model of change scale up, to host the website where the most important conversation takes place, or aggregate the Tw i tt er feeds of all the people one level below. This tendency is only natural when working on a platf orm biased toward abstraction. In fact, all media are biased toward abstraction in one way or another. By allowing us to describe events that had already taken place or those that had happened to other people, speech disconnected the doer from the deed. Text, meanwhile, disconnected speech from the speaker. Print disconnected text from the scribe, and the computer"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"73 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED disconnected print from paper. At each level of disconnection, these media became more abstract. Language is an abstraction of the real world, where sounds represent things and actions. It requires a tremendous amount of agreement, so that the same words mean the same thing to diff erent people. Text is an abstraction of those sounds—with litt le squiggly lines now representing the mouth noises that compose the words that represent real stuff . Over time, the way those lett ers look is standardized so that the writt en language becomes increasingly universal and applicable. Of course, the writt en word separates the speaker from his words. A person can put his words down on paper and be gone by the time it is read. He is at once more accountable for having writt en down his message or promise, and less accountable for not having to be there in the fl esh with the reader. It is easier to lie. On the other hand, text is more durable. It creates a record, a standard, and something to refer back to later. The invention of text allowed for contracts, the law, codes of ethics, and even the Bible—a writt en agreement or “covenant” between people and their new, highly abstracted God. In fact, the God of this new text-based civilization achieved all creation through spoken words. The printing press standardized text, depersonalizing the writing process, disconnecting the author from the page itself, but allowing for books to “scale” to mass consumption. Thanks"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"74 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF to printing, the single author can reach everyone—even though neither he nor the ink from his pen come into contact with them. Finally, the digital age brings us hypertext—the ability for any piece of writing to be disconnected not just from its author but from its original context. Each link we encounter allows us to exit from a document at any point and, more importantly, off ers us access to the bits and pieces of anyone’s text that might matt er at that moment. In a universe of words where the laws of hypertext are truly in eff ect, anything can link to anything else. Or, in other words, everything is everything—the ultimate abstraction. Of course this can be beautiful and even inspiring. The entirety of human thought becomes a hologram, where any piece might refl ect on any other, or even recapitulate its entirety. From a Taoist perspective, perhaps this is true. But from a practical and experiential perspective, we are not talking about the real world being so very connected and self-referential, but a world of symbols about symbols. Our mediating technologies do connect us, but on increasingly abstracted levels. Walter Benjamin, a German philosopher of the early twentieth century, wrote a seminal essay about the way photography and other reproduction technologies change our relationship to art. His observation was that the preponderance of photographs of a work of art in a mass-produced book have"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"75 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED a strange eff ect on the original: While they are themselves utt erly divorced from the context in which the original artwork exists, they actually make the original work more sacred. The original painting, hanging in the very cathedral for which it was painted perhaps, has what Benjamin called an “aura,” which is at least partly dependent on its context and location. A tourist, having seen its image again and again in books, might travel thousands of miles to encounter the real painting in its home sett ing and soak in the aura with which it is imbued. On the other hand, the reproduction is a rather profane imitation, existing in the more abstract and commercial world of mass-produced goods and mass culture. It’s not that Benjamin despises popular culture—it’s that he sees real art and artifacts being absorbed by a bigger spectacle, and audiences losing the ability and desire to tell the diff erence between that spectacle and real world. Strangely enough, as we migrate from his world of mass- produced objects to the realm of even more highly abstracted digital facsimiles, we nostalgically collect the artifacts of midcentury mass production as if they were works of art. Each Philco radio, Heywood Wakefi eld dresser, or Chambers stove is treasured as if it were an original. We can only wonder if cloud computing may make us nostalgic one day for having a real “fi le” on the hard drive of one’s own computer—or if silicon brain implants may make us wax poetic for the days when"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"76 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF one’s computing happened on a laptop. In the march toward increasing abstraction, whatever we had previously will seem like the real thing. By recognizing the abstracting bias of digital technologies, however, we can use it to our advantage. The same way Benjamin would have the printed art book inspire us to visit the original work in its real world context, our digital abstractions work best when they are used to give us insight into something quite real and particular. In just one example, consider the impact of fantasy baseball on the real game. Fantasy baseball—fi rst developed on an IBM computer in the 1960s—is a game where a participant’s roster of baseball players score points based on their statistics over a real baseball season. It’s a truly “derivative” game, in that fans create their own fantasy rosters of players, irrespective of their real teams, and in that winning and losing in the fantasy game is on a level fully abstracted from the baseball happening in the real world. Like any digital simulation, the experience of fantasy baseball is empowering to its participants. In fact, the game only became a mass phenomenon as free agenting and Major League players’ strikes soured fans on the sport. As baseball became a business, the fans took back baseball as a game—even if it had to happen on their computers. The eff ects didn’t stay in the computer. Leveraging the tremendous power of digital abstraction back to the real world,"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"77 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED Billy Bean, coach of the Oakland Athletics, applied these same sorts of statistical modeling to players for another purpose: to assemble a roster for his own Major League team. Bean didn’t have the same salary budget as his counterparts in New York or Los Angeles, and he needed to fi nd another way to assemble a winning combination. So he abstracted and modeled available players in order to build a bett er team that went from the bott om to the top of its division, and undermined the way that money had come to control the game. Since that time, many fantasy baseball players and digital statisticians have been hired to run the front offi ces of Major League teams. [ * ] So while the dangers of living and working in an inherently abstracted environment are very real, so too are the benefi ts. Abstraction has been around since language, perhaps even before. Money, math, theology, and games would all be impossible without abstracted symbol systems, accepted standards, and some measure of central authority. The digital realm is no diff erent in that regard. Yet digital abstraction does occur still one further level removed from what we think of as reality. While games and math might be abstracted representations of our world, our digital simulations are abstracted representations of those games and mathematics.

What these philosophers feared was that as we came to live in a world defi ned more by symbols, we would lose touch altogether with the real stuff ; we would become entranced by our simulated reality, and disconnect from the people and places we should care about. As we watch people wearing headphones and staring into smart phones, ensconced in their private digital bubbles as they walk down what were once public streets, it is hard not to agree with those pessimistic assessments of our procession into simulation. What the postmodernists may have underestimated, however, was the degree to which the tools through which these symbolic worlds are created—and ways in which they might be applied—would remain accessible to all of us. And how willing we may still be to use them.

The less we take responsibility for what we say and do online, the more likely we are to behave in ways that refl ect our worst natures—or even the worst natures of others. Because digital technology is biased toward depersonalization, we must make an eff ort not to operate anonymously, unless absolutely necessary. We must be ourselves . There are certainly instances where anonymity should be maintained. Dissidents in Iran, for example, can be killed for what they say. While posting anonymously confi rms the apparent authority of the government to censor through execution, it can also help keep an activist alive. But of course there is also great political power in standing up for what one believes in and hoping many others join in. Every openly gay person makes it easier for the rest of us to be open about our sexuality as well—to be more who we are, not less. Likewise, the millions of people protesting peacefully in the streets of Eastern European dictatorships were masses of individuals, not anonymous mobs. Their identities and collective personhood were their power. Digital technology allows for similar collective activity— but it is not biased that way. Our digital activity occurs out of"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"84 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF body. Whether sending an email, typing a comment to a blog post, or controlling an avatar in a video game, we are not in the computer, at a discussion, or in the fantasy world with our friends. We are at home or the offi ce, behind a computer terminal or game console. We are operating out of our bodies and free of our identities. This can promote an illusion that we may act without personal consequences. If we choose to maintain our anonymity as well, we are more likely to lash out from the seeming safety of obscurity. As website moderators well understand by now, the more anonymously people are allowed to post to a forum, the more quickly conversations will devolve into “fl ame wars” or just plain abuse. Requiring that people register to make comments invariably raises the level of conversation as well as the level of civility. This isn’t just because being identifi able means the user can be traced and caught. While the notion of repercussions may dampen the most aberrant or illegal behavior, it alone isn’t enough to explain how diff erently people act when they have an identity. In fact, the civilizing eff ect is nearly as powerful even when the identity of the user has been created for the specifi c online environment. For instance, when a gamer has been working with the same character over a period of months, he comes to care about that character as an extension of himself. Even if his real world identity has never been associated with the character, his real world time has been"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"85 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED invested in making the character a member of the community. The player has something at stake. Similarly, many bulletin boards award reputation points to users whose posts have been deemed valuable by other members. These points can take years to acquire. Like an eBay “seller rating,” the more time it has taken to acquire a reputation in an online environment, the more it matt ers—even when it is entirely out of body. Of course, the original hope of virtual community enthusiasts was that the disembodied nature of online interaction might help people overcome long-held prejudices. People couldn’t actually see one another, so they oft en made assumptions about the race, age, gender, and education of other participants. Professors got into extended dialogues with strangers online—who turned out to be laypeople or teenagers, while people of color were treated as equals in business communities for the fi rst time. Such anecdotes are encouraging, for sure, but they may represent less a triumph over prejudice than a detour around it. We are treating the stranger as an equal because we have made the false assumption she is just like us. It’s not that we see through our prejudices; we simply don’t see the person. Our experience online is less that of the unprejudiced intellectual than that of the autistic living with Asperger’s syndrome. While a lot has been argued back and forth about whether computer use or gaming might cause spectrum disorders, direct observation alone has revealed that our"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"86 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF digital behaviors closely mirror those of Asperger’s suff erers: a dependence on the verbal over the visual, low pickup on social cues and facial expressions, apparent lack of empathy, and the inability to make eye contact. This describes any of us online, typing to one another, commonly misunderstanding each other’s messages, insulting one another unintentionally, or seeking fruitlessly to interpret someone’s real meaning by parsing his words repeatedly. According to best estimates, [4] only 7 percent of human communication occurs on the verbal level. Pitch, volume, and other vocal tone account for 38 percent, and body movements such as gestures and facial expression account for a whopping 55 percent. As we have all experienced, the way a person makes eye contact can mean a whole lot more to us than whatever he is saying. But online, we are depending entirely on that tiny 7 percent of what we use in the real world. Absent the cues on which we usually depend to feel safe, establish rapport, or show agreement, we are left to wonder what the person on the other end really means or really thinks of us. Our mirror neurons—the parts of our brains that enjoy and are reinforced by seeing someone nod or smile while we are sharing something—remain mute. The dopamine we expect 4.

We remain in the suspicious, protective crouch, even when the situation would warrant otherwise—if only we were actually there. Imagine living in a world where you were deaf, dumb, and blind, and had to rely on the text coming at you in order to fi gure out what people meant and how they felt about you. Then, to this add not knowing who any of the other people really are. Living in a 7 percent social reality has real eff ects. As MIT researcher Sherry Turkle has discovered, [5] teens online rarely if ever apologize to one another. When they are caught having wronged someone, they confess—but they never say they’re sorry. It’s as if the factual statement of guilt matt ers more than having any feeling about it. Sorrow goes out with the other 93 percent. As if desensitized by all this disembodiment, young people also exhibit an almost compensatory exhibitionism. Kids on social networking sites and video channels share explicit photos of themselves, not just for money or items on their “wish lists” but simply to get noticed. They seem not to know—or to care—that everything they post remains permanent, ready to haunt them as they seek jobs or spouses in the future.

We’ll see about that. Less speculatively, all this over-sharing online is also a predictable reaction to spending so much time in a disembodied realm where nothing seems to stick, and nothing registers on a fully felt level. The easiest response is to pump up the volume and intensity. Sadly for young people, the digital realm is permanent. This robs from them the free experimentation that defi nes one’s adolescence. While parents might not relish pondering what happens between teens in the back seats of their cars or behind the bleachers on a Friday night, this experimentation isn’t being recorded in a database likely to outlast whatever was chiseled onto the walls of the Parthenon. And this permanence, once fully realized and experienced, only pushes the more cynical user to increasing layers of anonymity.

We become yet more anonymous actors in a culture where it’s hard enough not to antagonize the people we know—much less those with whom we interact namelessly and facelessly. On the other hand, maintaining a strict sense of identity online is liberating, even empowering.

While the Internet—then Arpanet—was a technological success, it had become overwhelmed by social use. The government decided to give it away. AT&T turned down the off er to take it over. In what may have ultimately been a kind of wisdom, they couldn’t see a business application for what appeared to be an academic social scene. The government ended up sett ing the net free, to a large extent, with the proviso that it only be used for research purposes. No one thought the net would end up going anywhere— not least of which because people conversing with one another over networks seemed to be a fi nancial dead end. The net was compared to Citizens Band radio—a two-year fad that faded even before a movie about the truck drivers’ lingo and culture could be shot and released. My own fi rst Internet book was actually canceled by the publisher in 1992 because they thought the net would be “over” by 1993, when the book would fi nally hit the shelves. The social, noncommercial net continued to grow and grow. By 1994, studies showed that families owning a computer modem were watching an average of nine hours"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"92 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF less television per week. Worse, at least to marketers, they were spending it in a completely commercial-free medium. Finally, aft er a series of violations by small businesses looking to promote their services online, the net was opened for commercial use. Legislators used the argument that it couldn’t be held back eff ectively anyway. At last, businesses were free to use the net to peddle their wares. Everyone got involved, putt ing a “dot-com” behind every word imaginable. And while a few businesses actually succeeded online, most of them failed—miserably enough to take the stock market down with them. This wasn’t entirely the net’s fault. The stock market had been looking for a new, exciting sector to lead it upward ever since the biotech crash of the 1980s. Digital media, suddenly unleashed to become the electronic strip mall for the twenty-fi rst century, seemed like a great new place for all that investment money to fl ow. Problem is, most Internet businesses didn’t really need all that venture capital—much less common stock. Three hackers in a garage were capable of building most online businesses for a couple of thousand dollars in pizza. Besides, Internet users were spending more time in chat rooms and conferences than on the intentionally “sticky” and heavy-handed sales sites of stores. And they were constitutionally and habitually opposed to paying for anything on a medium that had always been free. We didn’t want stuff , anyway; we wanted one another."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"93 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED The dot-com boom was followed by an even louder dot-com crash. And most people—at least most businesspeople and journalists—seemed to the think the net was over. Left to our own devices, however, net users began to blog. And link. And comment. The manic investment of the dot-com boom had given us a robust network and fast connections, with which we could now do as we pleased. The web still had businesses on it, but the vast majority of connections and conversations were between people. It turned out, content is not king— contact is. And so what we now call “social media” was born. Smarter businesses took notice. AOL, GeoCities, Friendster, Orkut, MySpace, and Facebook have each risen to channel all this social energy into a single, centralized location where it can be monetized. Successive rounds of investors fi gure that in all these digital connections and exchanges there must some marketing research to sell, some modeling that can be done, or some way to turn people’s contacts into sales leads. What all these social networking businesses keep gett ing wrong, however, is that the net is not becoming a social medium. It already is one. The history of the Internet can probably best be understood as a social medium repeatedly shaking off att empts to turn it into something else. And it will keep doing so. Our digital networks are biased toward social connections—toward contact .

People are able to sense when a social network is really serving some other purpose. Seemingly permanent monopolies on our online social activity lose their constituencies more quickly than they earn them. When one network begins to sink, users fl ock to the next one, rebuild their contact networks, and then go on with their socializing. Yes, each commercial social networking site—no matt er how seemingly permanent—will ultimately go the way of its predecessors. This is why I have att empted to use so few brand names in this book. The leading players seem permanent to us in the moment, but are forgott en just as quickly as they once took over the headlines. Remember Compuserve? Or America Online? How about MySpace? The social bias of the medium rejects the business bias of any particular venue. This essential bias is consistently misunderstood and mischaracterized as fear or selfi shness on the part of net users. The anger people feel over a social networking site’s ever- changing policies really has less to do with any invasion of their privacy than the monetization of their friendships. The information gleaned from their activity is being used for other than social purposes—and this feels creepy. Friends are not bought and sold. Yet this is precisely what most Internet businesses are"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"95 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED trying to do. Every company of every size is looking for a “social strategy” through which to extend its brand. Each company wants to build its own social network of customers— or to build pages in existing social networks and win “friends,” “fans,” or “likes” from the millions of potential users out there. It’s as if having what amounts to an email list will breathe life into brands already decimated by the Internet’s powers of deconstruction and transparency. What they don’t yet realize, however, is that it is too late for a business to go social. Every business already is social. Transparency is no longer a choice for businesses in the Internet age—it is a given. Where there are people, there will be conversations. Those conversations are already happening, with or without any particular company’s page or hub. The truth about what they do and how well they do it is already a topic of conversation. The real way to “go social,” if they wanted to, would not be to accumulate more page friends or message followers, but rather to get their friends and followers to befriend and follow one another. That’s how to create a culture in a peer-to- peer, networked medium. Instead of looking to monetize or otherwise intercede between existing social connections, those promoting networks should be looking to foster connections between people who are as yet unknown to each other yet potentially in need of each other. And then let them go about their business—or their socializing."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"96 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF The danger, of course, is that today’s “penny for your friends” social networks will survive long enough—at least one aft er the other—for their compromised social standards to become accepted or even internalized by users. Kids growing up as members of networks devised to exploit their social lives are not nearly as scandalized by all this as those of us who still hold on to the ideal of genuine, agenda-free connections between people. If the social urge online comes to be understood as something necessarily comingled with commercial exploitation, then this will become the new normative human behavior as well. Many people—and not just young people—are already incapable of seeing any ethical drawback to misrepresenting themselves to their online friends. “So what if I’m gett ing paid to tell everyone in my network that I’m a fan of a band I’ve never heard of before?” “Everyone is doing it.” “Caveat emptor—let the buyer beware.” The problem is, these people are not talking to buyers, but to friends. They don’t even experience their online social networks as somehow separate from their personal lives, but one and the same. Unlike the businessman who is ruthless on the job and loving at home, they are equally ruthless with friends and strangers alike. This may be more consistent, but it is hardly more evolved. It’s equal opportunity exploitation. Who ends up exploited most, of course, is the person who has been convinced to behave this way. And that’s where"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"97 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED some awareness of how particular interfaces, tools, and programs infl uence our behavior is so valuable. Social networking sites are fi lled with features, games, and activities that are compellingly addictive yet ultimately more rewarding to the network’s owners than its members. Taking an action in a game instantly (and usually invisibly) turns one’s entire network into a spam distribution list— selling her friends, and her friends-of-friends, to the game’s real clients: market researchers and advertisers. Instead of being rewarded with cash, the player is rewarded with game points, new abilities, or in-world treasures for each further infringement on her social network. Does it feel like bribery? Not really. It’s just the rules of the game. Once the fi rst few social barriers have been broken down, the stakes inside the game world begin to feel more real than the risk of insulting some “friend” in the social networking site, anyway. Those aren’t real friends, anyway. They are just fodder for the game. Sadly, though, they were real friends. Whether forged online or in the real world, these virtual connections are an extension of our social reality. These are the people who help us fi nd the right doctor when we are sick, who support us when we’re out of work, and who comfort us when we lose a relative. They’re the ones who help us fi nd a couch to sleep on when we’re traveling, a decent party to go to on Saturday night, or the right graduate program for a cross-disciplinary research interest. Finally though, all these contacts are less"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"98 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF valuable for the particular things they might do for us than for the mere fact that they are they are connected to us at all. Friendships, both digital and incarnate, do create value. But this doesn’t mean the people in our lives can be understood as commodities to be collected and counted. People are not things to be sold piecemeal, but living members of a network whose value can only be realized in a free-fl owing and social context. We have yet to fi nd out what that value might be. Content was never king, contact is. Yet the possibilities for new levels of human connectedness and collaboration off ered by networking technologies have hardly been tapped. We are too slow to realize that people are not a form of content—a resource to be bought and sold; they are fellow cells in the greater organism of which we are all a part but are barely aware. We value our increased contacts for what they might provide and miss the greater value of the contact itself. But it is this contact, this desire to construct a social organism together, that has been the driving force of digital technology all along. The instinct for increased contact is the evolutionary imperative we feel to become something greater than ourselves. Just as atoms combined into molecules, molecules clustered into cells, and cells collected into organisms, we organisms are networking into greater levels of organization. This is the real draw of the many interactive devices we"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"99 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED have brought into our lives. In a sense, the people dismissing the net as another form of CB radio had it right: We are still just fi nding novel ways of talking to one another. From the ridiculous faxes people used to send to each other containing lists of bad jokes to the tweets we now transmit by cell phone, each new communications technology provides a new excuse to forge connections. The content is not the message, the contact is. The ping itself. It’s the synaptic transmission of an organism trying to wake itself up."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" VIII. FACT Tell the Truth The network is like a truth serum: Put something false online and it will eventually be revealed as a lie. Digital technology is biased against fi ction and toward facts, against story and toward reality. This means the only option for those communicating in these spaces is to tell the truth. Before what we think of as media even existed, the majority of our information exchange took place at the bazaar—the market and social space where people gathered to buy and sell goods, meet up with friends and, probably most importantly,"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"101 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED learn what was happening in their world. While people may have actually spoken more at home, they were only exposed to new ideas when they entered the social and commercial realm of the bazaar. Everything took place there, from romance to bett ing to entertainment to shopping. Even the Torah was read on market days, for these were the only times a crowd would show up in one place. The activity of the bazaar was characterized by a multiplicity of interests and connections, all overlapping. Religion mixed with politics, romance mixed with commerce, and entertainment mixed with money-lending. Everyone was speaking with everybody else, and about all sorts of things and ideas. The bread man might share news of a friend’s wedding engagement, while the priest might have a recommendation of a new blacksmith. And while there were certainly a few storytellers—usually foreigners bringing the tales of other cultures—the majority of the interactions between people were based in nonfi ction. They talked about their products (who was selling the best fruit that day), gossip (who was sleeping with whom), weather, crops, local news, or even church politics. People exchanged the ideas, rumors, and facts that matt ered to them. The only mythological material came to them from the scroll read to them by a rabbi, or as ritual recited by a priest. The interactive medium of the day— conversation—was almost entirely based in facts. All of this information exchange allowed people to"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"102 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF improve on themselves and their situations. The ideas passing between them—what we now call “memes” (rhymes with teams)—behaved like genes. Memes passed from person to person, and replicated if they were useful and powerful or died out if they were not. Just as a species can get stronger through natural selection of genes, a society gets stronger through the natural selection of memes. Memes are just ideas that spread. The meme for exchanging grain receipts works bett er than the one for depending entirely on one-to-one bartering, and so the meme spreads and many towns develop coinage. Someone else has an idea for a second gear in the windmill mechanism. It works well, and so as other millers learn of the innovation, the meme for a second gear replicates and spreads. So does the meme for “Joe makes bett er shoes than Sam,” or “plant the seeds a week later this year.” We spread the ideas that we think are true, because this will increase our value to others. This is how the bazaar turned a feudal society of peasants into a new thriving middle class. It was a culture, constantly churning, mixing, and improving as individuals sought to improve their status. By the Late Middle Ages, the bazaar was working so well as a peer-to-peer economy that the aristocracy began to fall. As the former peasants rose to become a middle class of merchants and craft speople, they were no longer dependent on feudal lords for food and protection. Families who had been in power for centuries were losing ground."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"103 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED The royals hired some fi nance experts to help them reverse the trend, and they came up with two major innovations. The fi rst, centralized currency, required that no one use any means of exchange other than the coin of the realm—which had to be borrowed from the royal treasury, at interest. This was an easy way for people who already had money (the aristocracy) to make money simply by having money. The second invention, the chartered corporation, prohibited anyone from competing against one of the king’s offi cially sanctioned monopolies. Simply stated, no one could be in business for himself anymore, but had to work for one of the companies in which the king had invested. So the peer-to-peer bazaar that almost brought down feudalism was dismantled, and feudalism evolved into what we now think of as corporate capitalism. Sadly, along with the peer-to-peer economy went peer-to-peer communication. Companies tried to replace what had been relationships between people with relationships to brands. Instead of buying your beer from Bob the brewer, you’d buy it from the offi cially sanctioned monopoly. The seal on the bott le was to substitute for whatever human relationship existed before. To make this transition work, brands turned to the sorts of mythologies still in use today. The Quaker on a package of oats has nothing to do with the grain in the box; he is a story. As the Industrial Age gathered steam, more products— even more disconnected from their producers—needed to be"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"104 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF sold. Ad agencies developed powerful brands to camoufl age the factory-based origins of most of what people consumed. Industrial agriculture became the valley of a green giant, and factory-made cookies became the work of litt le elves working in a hollow tree. Mass media arose to disseminate all of these new myths, utt erly devoid of facts. And as long as media remained a top-down proposition, there was very litt le fact-based, peer-to-peer communication to challenge any of it. People were working hard on assembly lines or in cubicles anyway, no longer experiencing themselves in their multiple social roles simultaneously. They were workers on the job trying to earn a paycheck, and consumers at home relaxing to the mythological drone of mass media. Digital technology broke this. The fundamental diff erence between mass media and digital media is interactivity. Books, radio, and television are “read only” media. We watch, but only have a choice over how we will react to the media someone else has made. This is why they are so good for storytelling: We are in the storyteller’s world and can’t talk back. Digital media, on the other hand, are “read-write.” Any digital fi le that is playable is also sharable and changeable. (Files can be locked, at least until hackers fi gure out how to break the lock, but such protection is ultimately against the bias of the medium. That’s why it so rarely works.) As a result, we are transitioning from a mass"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"105 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED media that makes its stories sacred, to an interactive media that makes communication mutable and alive. Likewise, and in stark opposition to the media monopolies of broadcast radio and television, digital communications technologies are based on networks and sharing. The original reason computers were networked to one another was so that they could share processing resources. This makes them biased toward peer-to-peer activity. Mass media respected only the law of gravity: The people with the presses or broadcast facilities dropped their myths down onto the masses. Digital media go up, down, and sideways. In a sense there is no longer any up or down at all, as each node in the network can receive the message or refuse it, change it or leave it alone, and delete it or pass it on. We’re back in the bazaar. Only instead of individuals conversing one-on-one with our local friends and associates, each of us has a global reach greater than that of most broadcast television networks. Any one of our blog posts or tweets can end up becoming the next runaway meme, reaching millions of fellow users in hours—each of whom is free to comment, remix, and mutate the original. And once again, we are no longer confi ned to our arbitrarily limited and distinct roles of workers or consumers. We are at once consumers, producers, investors, critics, and more, capable of breaking down the myths of mainstream media and revealing"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"106 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF truths to one another. People are connected to one another on more than one basis again. It’s hard for any company to maintain its mythology (much less its monopoly) in such an environment. As we transform from media consumers back to cultural communicators, we message one another seeking approval and reinforcement. Myths and narratives will always be deconstructed, and mistruths eventually corrected. The bias of our interactions in digital media shift s back toward the nonfi ction on which we all depend to make sense of our world, get the most done, and have the most fun. The more valuable, truthful, and real our messages, the more they will spread and bett er we will do. We must learn to tell the truth . Sometimes it’s the most negative truths that spread the best and fastest: a sports hero in a sex scandal, a celebrity porn tape, a terrible crime, or an urban legend that goes “viral.” Yet even in the worst of those cases, the rumor is usually based either on an underlying truth or a cultural issue that has not been adequately addressed by its target. That’s why people are compelled to repeat it when they hear it. Whether it’s the news of a disowned princess dying in a car crash or a presidential candidate whose father is not a citizen, the untruths that spin out from there are just the uncontrolled mutations of people succumbing to some of the other biases of digital media. The information is still being presented and accepted as fact by newly minted digital citizens working"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"107 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED against centuries of mythological control. They are not yet particularly adept at discerning the truth. Even though the facts they believe may be wrong, they are still committ ed to the nonfi ction style of communication. The same is true for traditional media, where “reality” programs now outnumber scripted shows. Instead of watching situation comedies, we watch real people placed in outrageous situations: geeks trying to woo models, women competing to marry a millionaire who is actually a poor construction worker, or dwarves doing almost anything. By aping the nonfi ction bias of net entertainment, television and other traditional formats end up refl ecting only the worst side of each of digital technology’s other biases. The result is violent spectacle, dehumanizing humiliation, and collective cruelty. But the underlying urge is to participate and capitalize on a culture returning to fact-based exchange. It is not an exact science. As a person’s value and connections in the digital realm become dependent on the strength of their facts and ideas, we return to a more memetic, fertile, and chaotic communications space. Once a message is launched—whether by an individual or the CEO of a Fortune 500 company—it is no longer in that person’s control. How it is received, how it is changed, and whether it is replicated and transmitt ed is up to the network. May the best meme win. Advertising agencies believe they have all this"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"108 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF interactivity in hand. They look at the digital communications space as a “conversation” through which the newly empowered consumer can speak her mind to the company, ask for what she wants, and then see herself refl ected in the brand. Back and forth, call and response. Of course that’s just the wishful thinking of mass media professionals who have no great facts to transmit, and it’s wrong on both counts: It’s not a two-way conversation, and the person on the other end is no longer identifying herself as a consumer. The digital bazaar is a many-to-many conversation among people acting in one or more of their many cultural roles. It is too turbulent to be directed or dominated—but totally accessible to the memes of almost anyone, companies included. And since big companies, nations, and organizations generally produce things that aff ect a lot of people, the memes they release will tend to have more relevance and replicate bett er. Just not predictably. So when a car company decides to give its customers the online tools to make their TV commercials for a new vehicle, the most popular videos end up being anti-commercials, critical of the gas-guzzling SUVs. These scathing satires are the ones that get passed around the net, and even rebroadcast on television. It’s news. The company gets a conversation—just not the one it wants.

The beauty—and, for many, the horror—is that actions are even more memetic than words. In a digital communications space, the people do the talking. If a company wants to promote conversation about itself, all it really needs to do is something, anything, signifi cant. There are companies who get on the front page of the newspaper simply for releasing an upgrade to a phone. This is less about their ability to communicate than the power and importance of their actions to so many people. In advertising terms, this means abandoning brand mythology and returning to att ributes.

Ads based on brand image will only have staying power if they happen to be contradicted by some real fact about the company; then they will be valued by bloggers as terrifi c, visual evidence of corporate duplicity. Likewise, people will thrive in a digital mediaspace as they learn to share the facts they’ve discovered and disregard the nonsense.

OPENNESS Share, Don’t Steal Digital networks were built for the purpose of sharing computing resources by people who were themselves sharing resources, technologies, and credit in order to create it.

Whether we simply back up a fi le by sending it to the server holding our email, or go so far as to create a website archive, we all eventually make use of computing resources we don’t actually own ourselves. And, eventually, someone or something else uses something of ours, too. It’s the natural tug of digital technology toward what may well be its most essential characteristic: sharing. From the CPU at the heart of a computer distributing calculations to various coprocessors, to the single mainframe at a university serving hundreds of separate terminals, computer and network architecture has always been based on sharing resources and distributing the burden. This is the way digital technology works, so it shouldn’t surprise us that the technologists building computers and networks learned to work in analogous ways. Perhaps because they witnessed how eff ective distributed processing was for computers, the builders of the networks we use today based both their designs as well as their own working ethos on the principles of sharing and openness. Nodes on the Internet, for example, must be open to everyone’s traffi c for the network to function.

This is what makes the Internet so powerful, and also part of what makes the Internet so vulnerable to att ack: Prett y much everything has been designed to talk to strangers and off er assistance. This encouraged network developers to work in the same fashion. The net was built in a “gift economy” based more on sharing than profi t. Everyone wanted a working network, everyone was fascinated by the development of new soft ware tools, so everyone just did what they could to build it. This work was still funded, if indirectly. Most of the programmers were either university professors or their students, free to work for credit or satisfaction beyond mere cash. Prett y much everything we use on the Internet today—from email and the web to streaming media and videoconferencing—was developed by this nonprofi t community, and released as what they called freeware or shareware. The thrill was building the network, seeing one’s own innovations accepted and extended by the rest of the community, and having one’s lab or school get the credit. The boost to one’s reputation could still bring fi nancial reward in the form of job advancement or speaking fees, but the real motivator was fun and pride.

It’s as if our digital activity wants to be shared with others. As a culture and economy inexperienced in this sort of collaboration, however, we have great trouble distinguishing between sharing and stealing . In many ways—most ways, perhaps—the net’s spirit of openness has successfully challenged a society too ready to lock down knowledge. Teachers, for example, used to base their authority on their exclusive access to the information their pupils wished to learn. Now that students can fi nd out almost anything they need to online, the role of the teacher must change to that of a guide or coach—more of a partner in learning who helps the students evaluate and synthesize the data they fi nd. Similarly, doctors and other professionals are encountering a more educated clientele. Sure, sometimes the questions people ask are silly ones, based on misleading ads from drug companies or credit agencies. Other times, however, clients demonstrate they are capable of making decisions with their professionals rather than surrendering their authority to them—oft en leading to bett er choices and bett er results.

As examples of collective activity, they demonstrate our ability to work together and share the burden in order to share yet again in the tool we have gained. For many, it is a political act and a personal triumph to participate in these noncommercial projects and to do so for reasons other than money. These experiences and tools have, in turn, engendered an online aesthetic that is itself based in sharing and repurposing the output of others. As early as the 1920s, artists called the Dadaists began cutt ing up text and putt ing it together in new ways. In the 1960s, writers and artists such as William Burroughs and Brion Gysin were experimenting with the technique, physically cutt ing up a newspaper or other text object into many pieces and then recombining them into new forms. They saw it as a way to break through the hypnosis of traditional media and see beyond its false imagery to the real messages and commands its controllers were trying to transmit to us without our knowledge. Digital technology has turned this technique from a fringe art form to a dominant aesthetic. From the record “scratching” of a deejay to the cut- and-paste functions of the text editor, our media is now characterized by co-opting, repurposing, remixing, and mashing-up.

What we’re in the midst of now is a mediaspace where every creation is fodder for every other one. Kids repurpose the rendering engines in their video games to make movies, called “machinima,” starring the characters in the game. Movies and TV shows are re-edited by fans to tell new stories and then distributed on free servers. This work is fun, creative, and even inspiring. But sometimes it also seems to cross lines. Books are quoted at length or in decontextualized pieces only to be included as part of someone else’s work, and entire songs are repurposed to become the backing tracks of new ones. And almost none of the original creators—if that term still means anything—are credited for their work. In the best light, this activity breaks through sacrosanct boundaries, challenging monopolies on culture held by institutions from the church to Walt Disney. Aft er all, if it’s out there, it’s everyone‘s. But what, if anything, is refused to the churn? Does committ ing a piece of work to the digital format mean turning it over to the hive mind to do with as it pleases? What does this mean for the work we have created?

This is the liability of “processing” together. We are living in an age when thinking itself is no longer a personal activity but a collective one. We are immersed in media and swimming in the ideas of other people all the time. We do not come up with our thoughts by ourselves anymore, so it’s awfully hard to keep them to ourselves once we share them. Many young people I’ve encountered see this rather terrifying loss of privacy and agency over our data as part of a learning curve. They see the human species evolving toward a more collective awareness, and the net’s openness as a trial run for a biological reality where we all know each other’s thoughts through telepathy. Whether or not we are heading for shared consciousness, this “learning curve” should still be in eff ect. In short, we need to develop the manners and ethics that make living and working together under these conditions pleasant and productive for everyone. In the digital realm, with just a bit of eff ort, we can see, take, and replicate anything that anybody does. There is no such thing as unbreakable copy protection. If a CD or DVD can be played, it can be copied in one way or another (even if it means losing one “generation” of digital fi delity).

Or we could just look at their personal papers, review their tax fi lings and bank statements, and maybe check to see what form of birth control they use. What stops us is not law enforcement, but the social contract. On some level, through parental training or simple logic, we understand that a world where people broke into one another’s homes wouldn’t be a nice place to live. We respect the concepts of ownership and privacy because we want others to do the same. Restraint is just part of being members of a civilized society. These same social norms do not yet apply to the net, where sharing, borrowing, stealing, and repurposing are all rather mashed up themselves. That’s why we tend to apply the otherwise refreshing ethos of openness so universally and, ultimately, inappropriately. Having lived under a tightly controlled mediaspace for so long, its no wonder we experience our digital freedoms this way. The music and fi lm industries have made few friends with their draconian “digital rights management” (DRM) tools and enforcement policies. When we purchase and download certain music and movie fi les, we also end up installing a program from the publisher that monitors how we use the fi le—mainly to make sure we don’t give it to anyone else.

Besides, if we have bought a piece of music, shouldn’t we be allowed to share it with our friends and family? Or even just copy it to our many listening devices? In a sense, these DRM strategies constitute a kind of robbery themselves. In order to work, these secretly planted programs must actually utilize some of the capacity of our computer’s processors. They steal cycles and memory from our machines, carrying out tasks on behalf of companies without our consent. That’s stealing, too. The desperate eff orts of big business to protect its copyrights and those of its writers and artists—combined with the simplifying bias of the net—only polarizes the landscape further. Breaking copyright to steal and share music or movies becomes understood as the action of a legitimate openness movement, dedicated to access and equality for everyone. Very specifi c ideas about collaboration, such as open source development and Creative Commons licensing, are equated with a free-for-all revolution of openness. Down with the corporations, up with the people. Following the logic of this side of the net wars, everything anybody does must be posted online, for free, with comments on.

What this argument misses is that the very same kinds of companies are making the same money off text, music, and movies—simply by diff erent means. Value is still being extracted from everyone who creates content that ends up freely viewable online—whether it’s me writing this book or a blogger writing posts. It’s simply not being passed down anymore. The search engine company still profi ts off the ads accompanying every search for a text. Likewise, every “free” video by an amateur requires that amateur to buy a camera, a video-capable laptop, editing soft ware, and a broadband connection through which to upload the completed piece onto a conglomerate-owned video server, along with most of its rights. Value is still being extracted from the work—it’s just being taken from a diff erent place in the production cycle, and not passed down to the creators themselves.

And so it goes, all the while being characterized as the new openness of a digital society, when in fact we are less open to one another than we are to exploitation from the usual suspects at the top of the traditional food chain. Worst of all, those of us in a position to say something about any of this are labeled elitists or Luddites—as if we are the ones att empting to repress the natural evolution of culture. Rather, it’s the good old spectacle working its magic through a now-decentralized mediaspace. The results—ignorance, anger, and anti-elitism—are the same. By confronting the biases of digital media head-on, however, we can come to terms with the seeming paradox of ownership in a digital mediaspace. On the simplest level, the problem here is that the laws we developed to protect things used to deal with real stuff . Real stuff is in limited supply. Its scarcity demands protection. Digital content, because it can be copied for free, is in infi nite supply. When I steal a pair of shoes from a cobbler, his investment of time and materials have been robbed as well. When I illegally copy a song from an album, I haven’t cost the musician anything; at least I haven’t cost him anything more than if I had never listened to the song in the fi rst place.

Besides, why should I give him scarce money for something that can be copied infi nitely for free?"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"123 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED The answer, of course, is that I should be paying the musician for his time and energy making the music that I am enjoying. It’s a cost that should be shared by all of us who listen to it, and shared equally. This notion is alien to us. Millions of people use Wikipedia on a daily basis for their work and research, a privilege gift ed to them by thousands of writers and editors contributing their time for free. Traffi c is huge, but so few think to pay for it that the nonprofi t foundation funding Wikipedia can barely meet the costs of maintaining its servers. The openness of the net, and the ease with which we can make use of its resources for free, makes the notion of joining the paying minority look too much like the sucker’s bet in a bad game-theory scenario. But that game is rigged. The real problem is that while our digital mediaspace is biased toward a shared cost structure, our currency system is not. We are att empting to operate a twenty-fi rst-century digital economy on a thirteenth-century, printing-press-based operating system. It doesn’t work. As we have already seen, the centralized currency system we still use today was developed by a waning aristocracy looking to stifl e peer-to-peer economic growth and install a system of indebtedness. It is a printing- press-era strategy, in which a scarce currency loaned into existence from a central source generates competition between people for the precious jobs and goods of artifi cial monopolies. Meanwhile, we now have access to a decentralizing technology that permits the creation of value from the"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"124 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF periphery as well as the exchange of value in a peer-to-peer fashion. Instead of buying from and selling to one another through highly centralized corporations, we now have the technology required to buy from and sell to one another directly. Beyond using eBay or the less corporate Etsy or Craigslist to make those connections and conduct transactions, however, we also have the means to transcend traditional currency. Local currencies, made illegal to make way for centralized currency during the Renaissance, have already regained widespread acceptance following the banking crisis of 2008. Instead of borrowing this money from a bank, users earn it into existence by making goods and performing services for other people in the same community. [6] Peer-to-peer currencies are based in the abundance of production, rather than the scarcity of lending. This makes them biased, as is the net, toward transaction and exchange rather than hoarding for interest. Now that digital technologies off er us identity confi rmation, secure transactions, and distributed networks, we have the ability to operate local-style currencies on a global scale. Net-based, or “e-currencies,” have already been experimented with successfully in gaming environments, 6. See the LETSystems home page at htt p://www.gmlets.u-net.com/ for some simple explanations of how this works.

This is not as far-fetched a concept as it may appear. Even former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan sees private electronic currencies as a promising solution to the fi scal challenges posed by the information age. [7] Instead of buying the things other people make through centralized banks and credit card companies, peer-to-peer currencies allow for the direct transfer of value from one person on the periphery to another. Moreover, instead of being biased toward large corporations that can borrow money less expensively than small companies and individuals, e-currencies can be biased toward the people creating the actual value. Whether or not we are witnessing a wholesale change in the way money is created and exchanged has yet to be seen. Given the breadth and depth of change in other arenas as we move from an analog to a digital society, however, an upgrade of our currency’s operating system seems within reason. The one we have been using for the past seven centuries, and the banks behind it, appear to be having a hard time keeping up. Meanwhile, if people have the opportunity to directly fund the artists, writers, and other workers from whom they buy digital goods, they might feel more inclined to pay for what they use 7.

The people on the other side of the screen spent time and energy on the things we read and watch. When we insist on consuming it for free, we are pushing them toward something much closer to the broadcast television model, where ads fund everything. We already know what that does for the quality of news and entertainment. Yet this is precisely the model that the ad-based hosts and search engines are pushing for. By encouraging us to devalue and deprofessionalize our work, these companies guarantee a mediaspace where only they get paid. They devalue the potential of the network itself to create value in new ways. It’s just like free TV, except the writers and actors don’t receive any income. Instead, they just pay for the equipment to create and for access to the servers they don’t own. We accept this model only because we don’t know enough about how these systems work to make decisions about them intelligently.

It amounts to a statement made by an author and att ached to her work. While one of these statements may ultimately be legally enforceable, it is a system depending not on the courts but on the culture. To function, the community must agree to abide by its standards. Likewise, open source is not an invitation to take whatever you want, whenever you want it, no matt er who created it or how much it cost to produce. It is a working relationship among programmers to develop soft ware together and even capture some of the value they create. Instead of maintaining a competitive advantage by keeping their code closed and encrypted, developers keep their code open and visible for others to improve upon it. Instead of working in competing silos, programmers build off one another’s innovations. Participation is dependent on knowing both the programming code necessary to make valuable additions and the social codes necessary to do it in ways that respect the contributions of others.

Their bigger problem is that their entire orientation to computing will be from the perspective of users. When a kid is taught a piece of soft ware as a subject, she’ll tend to think of it like any other thing she has to learn. Success means learning how to behave in the way the program needs her to. Digital technology becomes the immutable thing, while the student is the movable part, conforming to the needs of the program in order to get a good grade on the test.

We lose sight of the fact that the programming—the code itself—is the place from which the most signifi cant innovations emerge. Okay, you say, so why don’t we just make sure there are a few students interested in this highly specialized area of coding so that we can keep up militarily and economically with everyone else?

We approached our cars as consumers, through ads, rather than as engineers or, bett er, civic planners. We gladly surrendered our public streetcars to private automobiles, unaware of the real expenses involved. We surrendered our highway policy to a former General Motors chief, who became secretary of defense primarily for the purpose of making public roads suitable for private cars and spending public money on a highway system. We surrendered city and town life for the commuting suburbs, unaware that the bias of the automobile was to separate home from work. As a result, we couldn’t see that our national landscape was being altered to manufacture dependence on the automobile. We also missed the possibility that these vehicles could make the earth’s atmosphere unfi t for human life, or that we would one day be fi ghting wars primarily to maintain the fl ow of oil required to keep them running. So considering the biases of a technology before and during its implementation may not be so trivial aft er all. In the case of digital technology, it is even more important than usual. The automobile determined a whole lot about how we’d get from place to place, as well as how we would reorganize our physical environment to promote its use.

If we don’t know how they work, we have no way of knowing what is really out there. We cannot truly communicate, because we have no idea how the media we are using bias the messages we are sending and receiving. Our senses and our thoughts are already clouded by our own misperceptions, prejudices, and confusion. Our digital tools add yet another layer of bias on top of that. But if we don’t know what their intended and accidental biases are, we don’t stand a chance of becoming coherent participants in the digital age. Programming is the sweet spot, the high leverage point in a digital society. If we don’t learn to program, we risk being programmed ourselves . The irony here is that computers are frightf ully easy to learn. Programming is immensely powerful, but it is really no big deal to learn. Back in the 1970s, when computers were supposedly harder to use, there was no diff erence between operating a computer and programming one.

The applications we wrote were crude and oft en rather pointless—like teaching the computer to list prime numbers, draw pictures with text, or, as in my own fi nal project, decide how to prioritize the decisions of an elevator car. I’m sure only one or two of us actually graduated to become professional programmers, but that wasn’t the point. All of us came to understand what programming is, how programmers make decisions, and how those decisions infl uence the ways the soft ware and its users function. For us, as the mystery of computers became the science of programming, many other mysteries seemed to vanish as well. For the person who understands code, the whole world reveals itself as a series of decisions made by planners and designers for how the rest of us should live. Not just computers, but everything from the way streets are organized in a town to the way election rules (are tilted for a purpose vote for any three candidates) begin to look like what they are: sets of rules developed to promote certain outcomes. Once the biases become apparent, anything becomes possible. The world and its many arbitrary systems can be hacked.

So the people investing in soft ware and hardware development sought to discourage this hacker’s bias by making interfaces more complex. The idea was to turn the highly transparent medium of computing into a more opaque one, like television. Interfaces got thicker and more supposedly “user friendly” while the real workings of the machine got buried further in the background. The easy command-line interface (where you just type a word telling the machine what you want it to do) was replaced with clicking and dragging and pointing and watching. It’s no coincidence that installing a program in Windows required us to summon “The Wizard”—not the helper, the puppy, or even that \"Paper Clip Man.\" No, we needed the Wizard to re-mystify the simple task of dragging an application into the applications folder, and maybe a database fi le somewhere else. If we had been privy to everything the Wizard was doing on our behalf, then we may have even been able to uninstall the entire program without purchasing one of those hard drive sweeping utilities. Instead, we were told not to look behind the curtain. It was all supposedly safer that way. Accepting the"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"136 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF computer salesman’s pitch as technological truth, we bought the false premise that the more open a device was to us, the more open it was to every bad person out there. Bett er to buy a locked-down and locked-up device, and then just trust the company we bought it from to take care of us. Like it used to say on the back of the TV set: Hazard of electric shock. No user serviceable parts inside . Computing and programming were to be entrusted to professionals. Consumers can decorate their desktops the way they like, and pick which programs to purchase, but heaven forbid they trust an unauthorized vendor or, worse, try to do something themselves. They must do everything through the centralized applications program, through the exclusive carrier, and not try to alter any of it. The accepted logic is that these closed technologies and systems are safer and more dependable. Of course none of this is really true. And the only way you‘d really know this is if you understood programming. Fully open and customizable operating systems, like Linux, are much more secure than closed ones such as Microsoft Windows. In fact, the back doors that commercial operating systems leave for potential vendors and consumer research have made them more vulnerable to att ack than their open source counterparts. This threat is compounded by the way commercial vendors keep their source code a secret. We aren’t even to know the ways we are vulnerable. We are but to trust.

[10] Like the military, we are to think of our technologies in terms of the applications they off er right out of the box instead of how we might change them or write our own. We learn what our computers already do instead of what we can make them do. This isn’t even the way a kid naturally approaches a video game. Sure, a child may play the video game as it’s supposed to be played for a few dozen or hundred hours. When he gets stuck, what does he do? He goes online to fi nd the “cheat codes” for the game. Now, with infi nite ammunition or extra-strength armor, he can get through the entire game. Is he still playing the game? Yes, but from outside the confi nes of the original rules. He’s gone from player to cheater. Aft er that, if he really likes the game, he goes back online to fi nd the modifi cation kit—a simple set of tools that lets a more advanced user change the way the game looks and feels. So instead of running around in a dungeon fi ghting monsters, a kid might make a version of the game where players run around in a high school fi ghting their teachers—much to the chagrin of parents and educators everywhere. He uploads his version of the game to the Internet, and watches with pride as dozens or even hundreds of other kids download and play his game, and then comment about it on gamers’ bulletin boards. 10.

Finally, if the version of the game that kid has developed is popular and interesting enough, he just may get a call from a gaming company looking for new programmers. Then, instead of just creating his own components for some other programmer’s game engine, he will be ready to build his own. These stages of development—from player to cheater to modder to programmer—mirror our own developing relationship to media through the ages. In preliterate civilizations, people att empted to live their lives and appease their gods with no real sense of the rules. They just did what they could, sacrifi cing animals and even children along the way to appease the gods they didn’t understand. The invention of text gave them a set of rules to follow—or not. Now, everyone was a cheater to some extent, at least in that they had the choice of whether to go by the law, or to evade it. With the printing press came writing. The Bible was no longer set in stone, but something to be changed––or at least reinterpreted. Martin Luther posted his ninety-fi ve theses, the fi rst great “mod” of Catholicism, and later, nations rewrote their histories by launching their revolutions. Finally, the invention of digital technology gives us the ability to program: to create self-sustaining information systems, or virtual life. These are technologies that carry on long aft er we’ve created them, making future decisions"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"139 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED without us. The digital age includes robotics, genetics, nanotechnology, and computer programs—each capable of self-regulation, self-improvement, and self-perpetuation. They can alter themselves, create new versions of themselves, and even collaborate with others. They grow. These are not just things you make and use. These are emergent forms that are biased toward their own survival. Programming in a digital age means determining the codes and rules through which our many technologies will build the future—or at least how they will start out. The problem, as I explained in the introduction, is that we haven’t actually seized the capability of each great media age. We have remained one dimensional leap behind the technology on off er. Before text, only the Pharaoh could hear the words of the gods. Aft er text, the people could gather in the town square and hear the word of God read to them by a rabbi. But only the rabbi could read the scroll. The people remained one stage behind their elite. Aft er the printing press a great many people learned to read, but only an elite with access to the presses had the ability to write. People didn’t become authors; they became the gaming equivalent of the “cheaters” who could now read the Bible for themselves and choose which laws to follow. Finally, we have the tools to program. Yet we are content to seize only the capability of the last great media renaissance, that of writing. We feel proud to build a web page or fi nish our"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"140 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF profi le on a social networking site, as if this means we are now full-fl edged participants in the cyber era. We remain unaware of the biases of the programs in which we are participating, as well as the ways they circumscribe our newfound authorship within their predetermined agendas. Yes, it is a leap forward, at least in the sense that we are now capable of some active participation, but we may as well be sending text messages to the producers of a TV talent show, telling them which of their ten contestants we think sings the best. Such are the limits of our interactivity when the ways in which we are allowed to interact have been programmed for us in advance. Our enthusiasm for digital technology about which we have litt le understanding and over which we have litt le control leads us not toward greater agency, but toward less. We end up at the mercy of voting machines with “black box” technologies known only to their programmers, whose neutrality we must accept on faith. We become dependent on search engines and smart phones developed by companies we can only hope value our productivity over their bott om lines. We learn to socialize and make friends through interfaces and networks that may be more dedicated to fi nding a valid advertising model than helping us fi nd one another. Yet again, we have surrendered the unfolding of a new technological age to a small elite who have seized the capability on off er. But while Renaissance kings maintained their monopoly over the printing presses by force, today’s elite"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"141 PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED is depending on litt le more than our own disinterest. We are too busy wading through our overfl owing inboxes to consider how they got this way, and whether there’s a bett er or less frantic way to stay informed and in touch. We are intimidated by the whole notion of programming, seeing it as a chore for mathematically inclined menials than a language through which we can re-create the world on our own terms. We’re not just building cars or televisions sets—devices that, if we later decide we don’t like, we can choose not to use. We’re tinkering with the genome, building intelligent machines, and designing nanotechnologies that will continue where we leave off . The biases of the digital age will not just be those of the people who programmed it, but of the programs, machines, and life-forms they have unleashed. In the short term, we are looking at a society increasingly dependent on machines, yet decreasingly capable of making or even using them eff ectively. Other societies, such as China, where programming is more valued, seem destined to surpass us— unless, of course, the other forms of cultural repression in force there off set their progress as technologists. We shall see. Until push comes to shove and geopolitics force us to program or perish, however, we will likely content ourselves with the phone apps and social networks on off er. We will be driven toward the activities that help distract us from the coming challenges—or stave them off —rather than the ones that encourage us to act upon them."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"142 DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF But futurism is not an exact science, particularly where technology is concerned. In most cases, the real biases of a technology are not even known until that technology has had a chance to exist and replicate for a while. Technologies created for one reason usually end up having a very diff erent use and eff ect. The “missed call” feature on cell phones ended up being hacked to give us text messaging. Personal computers, once connected to phone lines, ended up becoming more useful as Internet terminals. Our technologies only submit to our own needs and biases once we hack them in one way or another. We are in partnership with our digital tools, teaching them how to survive and spread by showing them how they can serve our own intentions. We do this by accepting our roles as our programs’ true users, rather than subordinating ourselves to them and becoming the used. In the long term, if we take up this challenge, we are looking at nothing less than the conscious, collective intervention of human beings in their own evolution. It’s the opportunity of a civilization’s lifetime. Shouldn’t more of us want to participate actively in this project? Digital technologies are diff erent. They are not just objects, but systems embedded with purpose. They act with intention. If we don’t know how they work, we won’t even know what they want.

On the other hand, the more humans become involved in their design, the more humanely inspired these tools will end up behaving. We are developing technologies and networks that have the potential to reshape our economy, our ecology, and our society more profoundly and intentionally than ever before in our collective history. As biologists now understand, our evolution as a species was not a product of random chance, but the forward momentum of matt er and life seeking greater organization and awareness. This is not a moment to relinquish our participation in that development, but to step up and bring our own sense of purpose to the table. It is the moment we have been waiting for. For those who do learn to program see the rest of the world diff erently as well. Even if we don’t all go out and learn to program— something any high school student can do with a decent paperback on the subject and a couple of weeks of eff ort—we must at least learn and contend with the essential biases of the technologies we will be living and working with from here on.
