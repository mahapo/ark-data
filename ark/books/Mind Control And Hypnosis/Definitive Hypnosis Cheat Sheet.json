[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Definitive Hypnosis Cheat Sheet This cheat sheet was originally put toge ther by professional hypnotherapist, and former stage hypnotist, Steven Ha ll MCOH MASC NLP. Its purpose is to reveal the secrets of hypnosis, making it accessible to everyone. These techniques will work for stage hypn osis or hypnotherapy, however, they are taught here for information purposes only. After reading this book you will have the knowledge and ability necessary to hypnotize people, but please do not practice hypnosis without first undergoing more intensive study. Details are included at the end of this book. Lesson One: Hypnosis is natural The first thing you need to know is that hypnosis is a very natural state. It requires no special power to hypnotiz e someone. If you can talk you can hypnotize. In fact, it is such a natura l state that people go into hypnosis regularly without even realizing it. The most common natural states occur while gazing into a fire or when driving (it’s that moment wh en you suddenly realize that you are unsure as to which route you have just dr iven home!) If you were to listen to some positive suggestions while in these naturally occurring trance states they would have an effect on you... so be aware of commercial radio on long journeys! When you intentionally hypnotize someon e what you are doing is operating the switch that puts them into this natural state at a time of your (and their) choosing, so that you can use it productively. Lesson Two: Relaxation causes trance There are many things that have been found to cause trance, these include confusion, shock, repetition, focused attention and relaxation. For the purposes of your studies we are going to be concentrating on relaxation, as it is the easiest to produce without offending your client. We will also be using focused attention as this will help to stop your clients mind from wandering during the induction process. The initial induction process is all about getting the client to relax, and, as"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"many people have completely forgotten how to do this, you do need to help them out a little; most people are a lot tenser than they realize. Lesson Three: Relaxing the client Before you actually begin the hypnotic pr ocess it is a good idea to have your client do a few physical relaxation exerci ses. This will put them in a much more responsive state during the actual inductio n and save you a great deal of time. The easiest and most effective way to do this is to have them tense and relax their muscles. Start with the face, by ha ving them screw it up nice and tight, hold it for a few seconds and then re lax. Next have them scrunch up their shoulders, hold them relax. Move on to arms, torso, stomach area, upper (then lower) legs and finally feet. When tensing the legs and feet be sure to tell your client to pull their toes and feet up towards the body rather than pointing them out straight as this could cause cramp. You should also tell your client that if tensing a certain area might be unwise due to health problems, then they can simply skip that area. An example might be someone who has suffered with a hernia. Once you have systematically tensed an d relaxed each area have them tense and relax their entire body in one go. Th is simple exercise will release a lot of tension and set them up nicely for the induction process. Lesson Four: The IRON MAN Induction Process Now that you know that relaxation and fo cused attention are two of the keys to successfully induction, you are ready to learn the induction script. I have laid out a script for you word for word below, but these words are not some kind of mystical incantation, they are not a spe ll that produces trance, they are simply a suggestive list of instructions and commands that will produce a relaxed state. You can just as easily make up your own induction scr ipt using this one as a guide. The goal here is to get your client to relax, so use your imagination and embellish on what I have given you here. When you deliver the script, do so in an authoritative confident tone. Do not be overly forceful, or your client may obje ct to being ordered about and resist. As you learn more about trance from furthe r studies you will learn a lot about the hypnotic voice, however at this stage my advice is to keep things very simple. Use a basic monotone, speak clearly and slowly. As the trance progresses your voice should slow down so that  you  compliment their  re laxed state."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" To induce trance have your client sit in a position that they find comfortable and continue with the following... Lesson Five: The induction script You are sitting here listening to the so und of my voice, perhaps wondering how it is that you are going to go into trance. As you listen to these words I would like you to focus your gaze on an imagin ary spot on the ceilin g. That’s good, in a few moments I will begin counting, wh en I say the number one, I would like you to close your eyes, and then on the number two, slowly open them, continue to open and close your eyes on alternating numbers in this way until your eyes feel so heavy that it would be easier and more comfortable to just let them remain closed. Whether you eyes are closed or open I would like you to keep your focus on that spot on the ceiling. Do not lower your gaze during the numbers on which your eyes are closed, keep your eyes fixed in position and imagine that you are still gazing at the spot. Ready? (As you progress through the numbers, begi n to lower the tempo of your voice, by number 11 you should be at a relaxing ly slow easy tempo. When the eyes no longer open at all go onto the next section) 1. Close your eyes now, but keep them in position. 2. Now slowly open them. 3. Closing your eyes now, noticing how co mfortable it feels to let them rest. 4. Now slowly open them, continue to gaze at the spot. 5. Closing down easily and slowly while you listen to the sound of my voice. 6. Slowly open. 7. Closing down now, and very soon yo ur eyelids will begin to feel very tired and heavy. 8. Nice and slowly open. 9. Just letting them close down now, so comfortable, so heavy and relaxed. 10. Slowly open them and focus on that spot. 11. More and more heavy with each number now, that’s fine. More and more relaxed as your eyes begin to feel so tired. 12. Softly and slowly opening them again now. 13. And closed, each time you open them it becomes more and more difficult. Heavier and heavier. 14. Feel the heaviness in your ey elids as you open them now. 15. And let them close down. Your eye lids are getting heavier and heavier, more and more tired with each number. That’s fine. As it becomes more"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"comfortable to just keep them clos ed you can allow yo urself to keep them closed now. 16. And open... so heavy... so tired. 17. And close them down again. So comfortable and relaxed. As you listen to my voice you eyelids are becomi ng heavier and heavier, more and more relaxed now. Heavy and heavy with each number. 18. Feel the heaviness increasing now as you open them. 19. Let them close down again. Heav ier and heavier now, so heavy, so tired, so relaxed, that’s fine. 20. And open. 21. And closed. Your eyelids are so heavy now that as I continue to count it becomes increasingly difficult to open your eyes, do not tr y to resist this, just feel their heaviness and when it is more comfortable to keep your eyes closed, simply en joy keeping them closed. That’s fine. 22. And slowly open. 23. Now close them down, just let them rest for a moment and enjoy feeling your eyes resting in th eir sockets, that’s fine. (Your client’s eyes should remain closed some time between numbers 10 and 15. Some clients will try to resist this and continue further, simply tell them that this is not an exercise to see how long they can last, and they should allow their eyes to close when th ey feel comfortable doing so . If their eyes still open on number 22 tell them to close them an d keep them closed on number 23. Then continue with the following.) Now that your eyes are closed, I would like you to continue listening to the sound of my voice as you co ntinue to relax. In a fe w short moments you will be so completely relaxed and comfortable that it will be easy for you to go into trance. As you go into trance you will st ill hear my voice. You are still able to think thoughts, thoughts can be thought, but you do not have to think them, as you listen to the sound of my voice you may like to imagine your thoughts floating away, as though they are tied to a helium filled balloon that carries them effortlessly into the distance. As you relax I wonder if you can recall, how does it feel when you are so completely relaxed that you lose awarene ss of your body. Or perhaps, what’s it like when you are so comfortable, so snuggled and warm that you can sink right down into the comfort. And ma ybe, sometimes when you listen so intently to what someone is saying eve rything else seems to melt away, and as you listen to this voice now, perhaps you can imagine how does it feel as all of your tensions melt away, allowing you to sink right down into the comfort. That’s right. I don’t want you to loose awareness of your body... just yet. For now just enjoy the process. I don’t know if you will go into trance qu ickly, or maybe take a little longer to"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"really enjoy the process as it begins to happen right.... Now. That’s fine. Just relax and listen to the sound of my voice. You are doing just fine. To help you to relax I wo uld like you to imagine that you are outdoors, on a wonderful summers day. You find yourself in a safe and relaxing place, where you are free to really relax and enjoy the environment. Find a comfortable place to sit down; where you can rest for a moment, perhaps leaning against a tree or a rock, that’s fine. You are safe and secure here, safe to relax completely, and no matter how deeply you go into trance, my voice will go with you. Lesson Six: The Black Mirror Technique By the time you reach this section your client will already be in a suggestible state, but the induction is not complete. It is now time to relax them even further. Continue with the induction process using the following script. As you find your comfortable place to re st and listen to my voice you can begin to allow any tensions to simply melt away from you, as though they are simply dripping out from your body and soaking down into the earth, that’s fine. To help you to relax I wo uld like you to imagine that a small orb of positive relaxing energy is floating effortlessl y above your head now. Just hovering there waiting. You can imagine this or b any way you choose, you might see it as a light or a colour, or perhaps yo u can simply sense its presence. In a few moments this orb of energy will slowly move through your body, as it does, every muscle that it touches instan tly becomes twice as relaxed, allowing you to feel a soft heavy sweetness deep inside your muscles, causing your muscles to feel so very he avy, so limp and loose. As you relax you can imagine this orb is beginning its journey now, slowly lowering deeper and deeper as it ease s gentle through your scalp and deep, deep down to the very base of your brain, that’s fine, relaxing you completely as it does. As this energy begins to soak around the sides of your head it sinks deep inside your ears now, and no matter how deep into trance you go into trance my voice will always be here with you. Gliding around each side of your head now and gently soaking in and around yo ur eyes, maybe bringing a wonderfully relaxing warmth, or a cooling ease to your eyes as it does. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"You can just take a few moments now to really relax all of those tiny muscles in and around your eyes, that’s fine. F eel your brow ease as you relax your face, your eyes just resting in their so ckets now, so comfor table, so easy and so relaxed. As you notice your eyes relaxing this energy continues down through your cheeks and slowly into the muscles of your jaw. This wonderfully relaxed sensation soaking deep into the bones of your jaw now and as it does I would like you to just let your jaw hang limp and loose, that’s fine, you are doing really well. As you continue to relax this sensatio n eases its way down into the powerful muscles of your neck, muscles that have been working so hard holding your heavy head upright all day. That’s fine, just allow them to relax as this sensation gently spreads out across your shoulders. Notice how your shoulders can drop a little more with each relaxing out-breath, until you feel quite free. As you continue relaxing more and more this wonderful sensation eases its way deeper and deeper now, that’s fine, deep er and deeper and just as you can go deeper and deeper into trance, this wonderful feeling can drift so deeply now so deeply down, soaking deep into your shoulders and slowly down your arms. Your arms getting heavier and heavier as you relax, more and more relaxed, until they feel nice and limp and loose, that’s good. The muscles of your arms are so relaxed now, like a handful of limp elastic bands, that’s fine. As you enjoy these sensations a gentle wave of relaxation begins at your shoulders and flows all the way down your back, taking you even deeper into trance. Deeper and deeper into trance now, with no effort required at all, it is so easy to just relax and let it happen all by it self. Just like when you go to sleep at night, you just relax and let it happen all by itself. Trance is like that now, just let go into trance and really enjoy the process as you relax deeper and deeper, that’s fine. As these feelings move down into your legs you can imagine you have been running so fast for such a long time that you are so tired now, so tired that all you want to do is rest... and now you can re st, that’s right, just allow your legs to relax now, relax and let go complete ly, feeling the tired heaviness taking you deeper and deeper. Lesson Seven: Deepening the Tran ce with the Clever Technique The previous script will have put your client into a light state of trance. At this stage, due to relaxation, they will be more susceptible to suggestion than in"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"normal waking consciousness; however, to ensure the hypnosis is successful you need to deepen the trance state. Deepening scripts create an association with moving in a downward direction and going into a deeper state of trance. We are going to use a very simply script that is easy to learn here, it is very effective and many hypnotists use this method. Simply continue from where you left off with the following deepening instructions. As a simple exercise, we have systematic ally relaxed your entire body, and this has been very easy for you to do. Now, it is time to go even deeper into trance, and to help you to go into trance, I would like you to imagine that you are standing at the top of an escalator. In a few moments I will begin to count down from 10 to 1. When I say the numbe r 10 you will step onto this escalator and as I count slowly down you will ride the escalator down until I reach the number 1, where you will find yourself at the bottom of the escalator and step off. Before we begin I would like to inform you of the magical qualities of this imaginary escalator. This is the escalator of trance, and the further down you ride the deeper into trance you will go . As I count down slowly, each number that I count takes you even deeper into trance, and the deeper into trance you go the more relaxed you become. The more relaxed you become the deeper into trance you go. So, as you stand at the top looking do wn I would like you to reach out now ready to step onto this esca lator of trance, and... 10. Step onto the escalator now and hold the hand rail as you begin your journey, deeper and deeper into trance. Each number that I count takes you even deeper into trance, and the further down the escalator you ride the deeper and deeper into trance you go. 9. Further down the escalator now, effo rtlessly gliding down into trance. 8. That’s fine, each number taking yo u deeper and deeper into trance. 7. Comfortably gliding down into trance, so easily, so effortlessly, just relax and let it happen all by itself. 6. Deeper and deeper now, that’s fine. As you listen to the sound of my voice, taking you deeper and deeper into trance. 5. Half way down the escalator now, re laxing so easily, each number taking you deeper and deeper into trance. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"4. Deeper and deeper, glid ing effortlessly deeper and deeper down, becoming more and more relaxed with every number that passes 3. As you approach the bottom of the escalator you drift deeper and deeper into trance, becoming increasingly open to the suggestions that you hear. That’s fine, so deeply relaxed now. 2. Almost at the bottom now, and as yo u reach the bottom you can step off the escalator easily and naturally, the moment you step off the escalator you fall into a deep, deep trance.... And..... 1. At the very bottom now, as you step off the escalator you become ten times as relaxed, going even deeper into trance. That’s fine, you are doing really well.... Lesson Eight: The transition Now that you have completed the deepenin g process, your client will be in a very suggestible state of trance. Howeve r, through experience I have noticed that the trance state can be further d eepened if you take a moment here to use a little confusion and a transitional process that will already be associated with sleep in the mind of the client. To accomplish this, as soon as you have finished the escalator script continue you with the following. You find yourself standing at the bottom of the escalator now, just in front of you there is a bed, a very special bed, a bed of dreams. Should you clamber onto this bed, you will instantly fall into a deep, deep sleep. But not the kind of sleep that you enter at night, a special kind of sleep, for this is the bed of trance and when you clamber upon it you will enter a deep, deep hypnotic sleep. Clamber upon the bed now and allow yourse lf to sink deeper and deeper into the soft comfort. As you sink into the co mfort you fall into a deep, deep....... SLEEEEEP! That’s fine... The kind of sleep where you can dream, a special kind of hypnotic sleep, where you can dream that you are standing before a wonderfully comfortable bed, a magical bed, a bed that can realize your dreams. As you clamber upon this bed you fall into a deep, deep... SLEEEEP! The kind of sleep where you can dream... Dream that you are going deeper and deeper now, deeper and deeper to.... SLEEEEP! A spec ial kind of sleep, where you can still hear my voice, a wonderfully relaxing sleep, where you are free to dream, dream that you are listening to the sound of my voice, hearing these suggestions like seeds, planted deep in your subconscious mind."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Lesson Nine: Trance suggestions for stage The transitional script that you have just learned makes it easy to follow through with your suggestions. This is the actual purpose of the hypnosis, without hypnotic suggestion you are do ing nothing more than relaxing the client, and although this is incredibly bene ficial in itself, it is unlikely to elicit positive life changes, and certainly is not very entertaining. What you use the trance state for depends on your particular area of interest, you may choose to develop trance for en tertainment, or, as I would like to think, you may be more interested in developing your skills as a hypnotherapist. Perhaps one of the most im portant suggestions that yo u should include at this stage is that your client will be able to get back into this state easily. This will prove valuable in all situations, but it is essential for stage hypnosis. This is done using a post hypnotic cu e by attaching a trigger to a desired action. Stage hypnosis is complete ly dependant upon post hypnotic suggestions, such as, ‘When you hear this piece of music you will leap onto the stage and start dancing.’ Then the volunteer is woken from the trance state and asked a few questions before the trigger music is played and the action carried out as requested. The most important post hypnotic suggestion that stage hypnotists use is, ‘For the rest of the evening, whenever I c lick my fingers and say the word “Sleep” you will instantly go back into trance.’ Everything else a stage hypnotist does comes down to personal ta ste and imagination. Note that I did say for the rest of the evening, you should include these ‘safe- guards’ to ensure that your volunteers do not walk away with suggestions still active. A post hypnotic suggestions ca n theoretically last a life time, the longest I know of has been 29 years, so be sure to use time limits and to remove them at the end of the show by telling your subjects that they are completely back to their normal waking consciousness and that the suggestions that you have given them during the show no longer have any affect. Lesson Ten: Trance suggestions for therapy As already stated, this area of hypnosis is simply for information at this stage, if you want to develop your ability as a hypnotherapist please first complete a course of study, we have included some information on this at the end of the book for you. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"If you obey the three golden rules of therapy creation you will be able to develop effective hypnotic scripts for almost any situation. But, as I say, this is not an area an amateur should experiment with, and under no circumstances should you diagnose or treat any ailmen t, no matter how obvious it may seem, without correct training. The three essential rules of hypnotic suggestions are... 1. Keep your suggestions positive 2. Keep your suggestions in the present tense 3. Test everything by future paci ng before you make any changes By adhering to these simple rules you avoid some of the common pitfalls of hypnotherapy. For example, if you are treating some one for smoking a st atement such as, ‘You will stop smoking in 2 weeks’ would break the first two rules, yet you are making a similar suggestion with the st atement, ‘In 2 weeks time, you are a non-smoker’ while at the same time keep ing it positively focused and in the present tense, it might, at first glance, appear to be future tensed, but the statement, ‘You are a non-smoker’ Is se t in the present and this will have an affect on how the clients subconscious mind accepts and acts upon it. Lesson Eleven: Waking the client from trance One of the most commonly accepted misconceptions of trance is that it is possible to become ‘stuck’ in hypnosis. Th is simply is not true. It is no more possible to get stuck in hypnosis as it is to get stuck in normal sleep. If a situation arose where a person was left in a very deep state of trance they would either wake the moment the hypnotist leaves, wake because of boredom, lack of comfort or a full bladder, or, if they are very tired, fall into normal sleep and wake in the morning as usual. It is actually very difficult to remain in the hypnotic state for a prolonged period of time without the a ssistance of a hypnotist. Having said that, you still need to know the correct way to wake your client. The following script should se rve you well. The golden rule here is to not wake your client too abruptly, and to always wake them in a good mood! Just as you progressively reduced your tempo during the induction it is now time to turn things up... increase in tempo and volu me as you run through the wake up script, be enthusiastic and make yo ur voice vibrant and exciting. In the next few moments I will count fr om 1 to 5. When I reach the number 5"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"you will be completely awake and feelin g absolutely fantastic. With each number that I count you become more an d more alert, until on the number 5, you open your eyes an d are wide awake. 1. Beginning to awaken now, aware of my voice and the room around you. 2. Waking from the trance state feeling fantastic, bringing with you all that you have learned. 3. Aware of your body now, and the position of your arms and legs. 4. Stretch your arms now as you begin to open your eyes, feeling refreshed and excited about your trance experience. 5. Eyes open and wide awake. Feeling fantastic! Well done! And that is all there is to it! If yo u have their consent, you can use these techniques to practice on your friends, but as the author of this material I can accept no responsibility for your action s. Be sensible and think about your suggestions before you use them, prep are everything you are going to say before you start, if you make things up on the spur of the moment you could say something that you, or your volunteer, later regret. As with all new skills practice makes perfect, and you will learn a great deal about trance from your expe riments with friends. That’s what got me started, and in the early days I knew less about tr ance than you have just learned from this short introduction. Sometimes my inductions worked, sometimes they didn’t, as your skills deve lop you will find that your successes increase, so will your fascination with everything hypnotic ! Learning hypnosis is the single most valuable tool that I ever learned and I be lieve that if you de velop your skills as a practicing hypnotist rather than settlin g for a curiosity satisfied then trance can change your life too.
