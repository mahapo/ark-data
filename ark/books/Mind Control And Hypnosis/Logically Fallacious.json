entering some kind of early-stage, intellectual,mid-life crisis, I became passionate about science, philosophy, and religion,which eventually led to my starting a debate website called DebateGod(http://www.debategod.org [http://www.debategod.org]), as a way to help meunderstand how other people think, and come to the conclusions they do. What Inever imagined, is that this little “side project” of mine would result in hoursa day of evaluating arguments, reasoning, and logic, opening my eyes to a worldof truth, hidden by a world of fallacious reasoning.But this discovery did not happen overnight.After years of what I considered eloquent defense of my positions, I found thatI was getting nowhere (in part, because those with whom I was debating did notvalue logic and reason, but more on that later); despite my facts beingcorrect. My positions, those which I could confidently defend, were being overshadowed by what appeared to be well-crafted, air tight, arguments from theopposition, supporting the literal and historical existence of a talking snake,a 6000 year-old universe, and even a flat earth. At one point I actuallythought I was in the Twilight Zone1[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_187.html#filepos770867]. Butsomething had to be wrong; and something was.As you might have already guessed, snakes really don’t talk, the universe mightbe a bit older than 6000 years (give or take 13.7 billion years), our earth isabout as flat as Dolly Parton’s chest, and every such similar argument is asflawed as the late Michael Jackson’s late nose – I just couldn’t see why. Then one day, I picked up a textbook on argumentation. This opened my eyes toa whole new area of study which led me to the study of logic (both formal andinformal), reasoning, persuasion, critical thinking, rationality, rhetoric, theexistence of cognitive biases, and fallacious reasoning. I felt like Neolearning Kung-Fu – I devoured as much information as I could in these areas andcould not stop. I can honestly say that I now see clearly what I missed thefirst 38 years of my life – deception, erroneous thinking, and faulty reasoning,coming from others as well as coming from myself.With my new superpower, I deconstructed many of my long-held beliefs and myreasons for having them. Let me tell you, this is a very humbling experience. My attitude changed towards those with bad reasons for holding differentbeliefs, because I now realize that our emotional, and often irrational,unreasonable, and illogical brains get in the way. It is this “secret” thatevery human being should know. Once we know that our brains deceive us, we canlearn how they deceive us, how to recognize such deception, than allow our logicand reason to triumph.For so long I have been trying to debunk one superstitious and/or irrationalbelief after another, which is like giving people intellectual fish, rather thanteaching them how to intellectually fish for themselves. And then it hit me...> Expose an irrational belief, keep a man rational for a day. Expose> irrational thinking, and keep a man rational for a lifetime.This book is a crash course, meant to catapult you into a world where you startto see things how they really are, not how you think they are. The focus ofthis book is on logical fallacies, which loosely defined, are simply errors inreasoning. With the reading of each page, you can make significantimprovements in the way you reason and make decisions. And I’ll bet you $1that once you start reading this book you will find it difficult to stop. If Iwin, save your money and relish in your newly found enlightenment. If you findthis book doesn’t interest you, then you can just send me the $1 by mail.2[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_187.html#filepos771412] Otherwise,enjoy the book!"},{"pageContent":"IntroductionWhile this book is written for the layperson, we do need to at least introducesome concepts which may be new to you, but play an important role in reasoning,as well as issue a few warnings, and explain how this book is organized. Butfirst, let’s answer the question, “what’s up with the title?”In debating claims against the supernatural, I have found that in virtually allsituations, what is trying to be passed off as a magically delicious argument,it is actually just logically fallacious – no magic involved. Using bad logicand fallacious reasoning, one can easily create an argument making some use of“magic” look like the only reasonable conclusion, when in fact, the reasonableconclusion is that the argument is fallacious. Although this book and theexamples within extend in all areas where reason is required, the name stillworks. Besides, the domain name was available.ReasoningHumans have the capacity to establish and verify facts, to change and justifybeliefs, and in general, to make sense of things. We do this by reason, andthe process of doing so is called reasoning. While virtually all healthyhumans are capable of reasoning, an alarmingly small percentage of us areactually any good at it. This is due to many reasons which we will beexploring throughout this book.ArgumentsWhen we hear the word “argument”, we tend to think of a confrontational argumentbetween two or more people, with bickering, defensiveness, and increasednegative emotions. This is only one kind of argument – not the kind we will befocusing on in this book. In the more general sense, an argument is an attemptto persuade someone of something by giving reasons to accept a givenconclusion. We make and hear arguments every day and often do not recognizethem. We are constantly being bombarded with persuasion and led toconclusions, without being consciously aware. Sometimes the persuasion is verysubtle, sometimes the reasons are implied, and sometimes the conclusion isassumed. For the purpose of this book, we just need to be able to recognizearguments when we hear them or make them.An argument is made up of premises and a conclusion. The premises can also bereferred to as reasons, supporting evidence, or claims. At times, our examplesare just propositions or assertions – a statement to be accepted.I use the terms arguer and opponent or audience to represent the one making theargument and the person or persons considering the argument, respectively. Keep in mind that the arguer can be a political candidate, Jehovah's Witness, aspouse, the 17-year-old kid at the returns desk in Walmart, or anyone capable ofrational communication, and the opponent/audience can be a police officer, yourbest friend, your spouse, or anyone capable of rational communication.Deduction is a form of reasoning and argument in which the conclusion followsnecessarily from the premises. Sticking with the classic example:> Premise 1: All humans are mortal.> Premise 2: Socrates is a human.> Conclusion: Socrates is mortal.If the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. That is what makesan argument deductive. This is also referred to as a formal argument.Arguments where the conclusion is merely based on probability, not necessity,are considered inductive arguments. These are usually constructed throughinductive reasoning, which is the process of making general conclusions fromspecific instances. For example:> Premise 1: The sun has risen every day so far.> Conclusion: Therefore, the sun will rise tomorrow.Because the sun could possibly explode tonight, the conclusion is just veryprobable, therefore, this is an inductive, or informal argument.I will be using these terms throughout the book. If you don’t understand themnow, you will very soon.Sometimes even statements of facts can be considered arguments – or moreprecisely, made into arguments. For example:> People need food to live.Generally this is not an argument because there is no persuasion intended – itis assumed that they accept the proposition and its implied conclusion. Butwhat if someone says, “That’s poppycock!” First, you should make sure that youdidn’t travel back to a time when “poppycock” was actually used, then you mightwant to rephrase your statement of fact into more of a recognizable argumentform, perhaps a bit more personal, with nothing implied. This may be as simpleas stating, “If you stop eating, then you will die as a result.” Or you mayhave to break the argument into many sub-arguments, for example, what “food”exactly is, what it means to “live”, etc.Arguments are everywhere. You make them everyday, and you hear them everyday. Where you find arguments, you find fallacious arguments. Where you findfallacious arguments, you find fallacious reasoning.BeliefsA belief is defined as the psychological state in which an individual holds aproposition or premise to be true. Beliefs are formed in many different ways,which is way outside the scope of this book, but it will suffice to say thatmany beliefs are not formed by reason and critical thinking. For our purposes,we are focusing on two aspects of beliefs: 1) the reasoning we use to form newbeliefs and 2) the reasoning we need to evaluate our existing beliefs.Beliefs can often be stated explicitly as beliefs, stated as opinions, implied,or arrogantly stated as fact. Some examples:> I believe that unicorns exist.> In my opinion (or I think), everyone should remain celibate for life.> Hot dogs are delicious when ground up into powder and snorted.> If you are not baptized as an adult, you are going to Hell!Beliefs can be wonderful, as in believing that humanity is overall good. Beliefs can be benign, as in believing the Red Sox are better than the Yankees3[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_187.html#filepos771740]. And beliefscan be devastating, as in believing your god wants you to fly planes intobuildings. But no matter how good a belief makes us feel or how good thepotential outcome of a belief can be, it does not effect the truth of thebelief. And this book will help you find the truth of beliefs, by examiningfallacious reasoning.FallaciesAlthough the term “fallacy” can be used in many ways, I will be using the termin the following three ways, all of which support the main purpose of this book– to promote better reasoning.> 1. Fallacious Arguments. Arguments that are fallacious contain one or more> non-factual errors in their form. > Just like a woman has the right to get a tattoo, she has the right to get an> abortion. (weak analogy> [CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_180.html#filepos722993])> 2. Fallacious Reasoning. When an individual is using erroneous thinking> (including bypassing reason) in evaluating or creating an argument, claim,> proposition, or belief.> I was pro-abortion before, but now that this speaker made me cry by showing me> a photo of an aborted fetus, I am against abortion. (appeal to emotion> [CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_027.html#filepos170928])> > 3. Fallacious Tactics. Deliberately trying to get your opponent or audience> to use fallacious reasoning in accepting the truth claims of your argument.> All I need to do is show the audience this photo of an aborted fetus, and they> will be like putty in my hands. I will get them to bypass their reason and> critical thought, while listening only to their emotions. (appeal to emotion> [CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_027.html#filepos170928])And perhaps a fourth use of the term: a specific classification of an erroneousargument as in, “Appeal to Authority fallacy.”Fallacies are dangerous because they are not always easy to spot, especially tothe untrained mind, yet they often elude our critical faculties, making thempersuasive for all the wrong reasons – sort of like optical illusions for themind. Some, however, are as clearly wrong as a pig roast at a bar mitzvah. For example,> “Don’t grow a mustache, because Hitler had a mustache, therefore, you will be> like Hitler!”After reading this book, you can probably match about a dozen fallacies with theabove argument, the error in reasoning should be apparent – sharing a physicalcharacteristic with a fascist dictator will not make you a fascist dictator.Now if I told you that the sun was about 30 miles from earth and the size of afootball stadium, I would not be committing a fallacy – but I would be a moron. Factual errors are not fallacies.In many cases, fallacies can be committed by either the author of the argument,the audience interpreting the argument – or both the author and the audience. For example, in the argument by fast talking fallacy[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_045.html#filepos239834], the author(the one doing the fast talking) could simply be a natural fast talker, but you(the audience) can fallaciously reason that to mean he is very smart, confident,and therefore, conclude that his claims are true. The arguer might be talkingfast purposely, knowing that you will not have enough time to process his claimsand construct a counter-argument, and could be accused of fallacious tactics,but not necessarily guilty of fallacious reasoning. And in this case, theargument itself would not even be fallacious.On Reason and RationalityIf you are a parent, you know exactly what it is like to argue with someone whois unreasonable and irrational. Most attempts at logic and reason end with theparent coming down to the level of the child – basing arguments on emotionusually in the form of a tasty bribe or smacked bottom, depending on what thecircumstances call for. Unfortunately, many people carry these success-repellingtraits with them into adulthood. This makes communication, cooperation, andprosperity a real challenge.As you might have guessed, those who are unreasonable and irrational are eitherincapable or unwilling to accept that their arguments are fallacious, if in factthey are. In these cases, you can come down to their level, appeal to theiremotions, and exploit their cognitive biases – but this takes some manipulativetalent and I would argue that it is not very ethical. You can simply give upand refuse to argue any further, which I have done at times. Or, if possible,you can show how their arguments and beliefs are inconsistent with other beliefsthey hold. This is my preferred strategy, because it is not patronizing, nordoes it reflect my frustration. One possibility: start by telling them whytheir argument is fallacious, then, by analogy, give them an example of thatfallacy on a different topic. For example:> Simon: Noah’s ark is a real historical event!> Anna: Then how did Noah manage to collect all those animals from all over the> world, and get them to cooperate?> Simon: Well, I guess God used his omnipotence to make it happen (ad hoc> fallacy [CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_007.html#filepos92505])> Anna: (instead of attempting to explain how rationally that makes no sense)> Then why didn’t God just use his omnipotence to save all the animals – not> just two of each kind?> Simon: I really don’t know.Collecting FallaciesWhen I was a kid I collected baseball cards, now as an adult I collect logicalfallacies (what a geek). Fallacies range from the well-known to the obscure,ancient to the modern, clear to the complex. Like astronomical objects, newones are being “discovered” all the time, and if you discover one, you get toname it. In addition to the over 300 I have collected over the years, I have afew of my own that I am proud to share for the first time. Mine are indicatedby a “*” after the name, and are just as valid as is Aristotle’s.I know of no other collection as complete, so I hope you appreciate all my hardwork that went into this book, and you decide that you should have paid muchmore for this book, and send me a check for the difference.Being a Smart-AssThere are two general schools of thought on how to point out a fallacy to youropponent. On the one hand, you can tactfully explain why your opponentsreasoning is erroneous (1 smart-ass point), without mentioning the name of thefallacy. On the other hand, you can tell your opponent that his reasoning isfallacious (1 smart-ass point), tell him the name of the fallacy he committed(another smart-ass point), tell him why it is a fallacy (another smart-asspoint), then extend his underwear over his head, and conclude with, “by the way,in Latin that fallacy is known as [insert Latin name here].” (10 smart-asspoints)! Of course, you could take a path somewhere in between. But what youcertainly should be prepared for, is your opponents pointing out your fallacies,and if you know about fallacies, you will be prepared to defend yourself.I do caution you against correcting fallacies that your opponent might raise. As you will see in this book, fallacies go by many different names, and thereare varying definitions for the fallacies. With the exception of a handful offallacies that have been around since the time of Aristotle, most fallacies areunder a continual redefining process that might change the name of the fallacyor the meaning of the fallacy. The bottom line, focus on exactly what error inreasoning you are being accused of, and defend your reasoning – not a definitionor name.Format and Style of this BookIf you haven’t noticed by now, I like to have fun with both writing andlearning. I understand that by using humor that I will inevitably offendsomeone, which is unfortunate, but a fact of life.While this book can function as a reference book, I hope you will read this likea novel – from cover to cover. I define what I feel may be unfamiliar terms tothe reader as I progress through the fallacies, in order. Therefore, if you doread the fallacies in order, unfamiliar terms and concepts will be revealed toyou as needed – I do this to keep the book interesting.While it may seem like a crazy number of fallacies to read through, I have donemy best to make it enjoyable and educational. The fallacies that are seldomever seen or not quite fallacies, and not worthy of a complete entry in thisbook, are just listed in the back section of this book with brief descriptions.There have been many attempts to categorize fallacies, some of which may makefallacies easier to understand. But I have chosen to organize all fallacies,alphabetically, by the name for which they are best known. I chose this methodbecause:> • There is no official taxonomy, nor is there even a taxonomy accepted by the> majority of those whom classify fallacies.> • The ambiguous nature of most of the fallacies means that many of the> fallacies can fit in a variety of categories.> • Focusing on faux-categorical structures distracts from the fallacies> themselves.Fallacy Name(s). Each fallacy begins with the most commonly used name for thefallacy, followed by the latin name (if there is one). I then list all otherknown names for the fallacy. At times there might be slight differences in thefallacies that go by other names, but unless I feel the differences are worthyof their own entry, I will just list it as another name for the fallacy. Keep inmind that fallacies are named and referred to mostly by common usage. Thepoint of listing every known alias is not so you can memorize them; it’s just soyou might recognize them when referred to by these other names.Description. My descriptions are all short and to the point, giving you theinformation you need to understand the fallacy, while sometimes adding in someextra commentary.Logical Form. Some fallacies, especially formal ones, have what are calledlogical forms, which means that the general fallacy can be represented insymbolic language. I list the logical forms where they apply to help youbetter understand the fallacy. With informal fallacies, I use a littleartistic license to create a logical form – but only when I feel it will helpyou better understand the fallacy.Example(s). I try to include realistic examples, and in fact, many examplesare from actual debates of mine (real names protected). I feel that usingrealistic examples will help you to identify the fallacies when used in realsituations – people aren’t as stupid as they are portrayed in many examples. If the fallacy requires it, I will use an extreme example to make the fallacyclear, then include a second or even third example that is more realistic.You will find that many of my examples include common creationist arguments. Acreationist is someone who believes in the literal interpretation of thecreation story in the Bible, Adam and Eve, the talking serpent – the wholeshebang. A young earth creationist is one who believes the timeline suggestedin the Bible for the age of the universe is about 6000 years. I use theseexamples quite often because they are like crack-cocaine for the reasonablethinker looking for fallacies. Let me be clear, maybe the universe is just6000 years old and I, along with 97% of scientists4[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_187.html#filepos772084] on the planetare dead wrong. For our purposes it doesn’t matter. Fallacies are notnecessarily about the truth of the argument; they are about the form of theargument.Exception(s). Fallacious arguments and fallacious reasoning are more oftenprobability-based than based on an objective fact. Take the following informalor inductive argument, that virtually everyone would consider fallacious:> “Don’t grow a mustache, because Hitler had a mustache, therefore, you will be> like Hitler!”Perhaps some phycologist has some data supporting the idea that a mustache,especially a Hitleresque one, can make that individual more susceptible togenocide (I would really like to see the details of that study!) Therefore,one can argue that this argument is not fallacious – the argument itself isstrong and the reasoning that was used to construct this argument was sound. Showing this argument is fallacious can be an argument in itself, where it isall about providing stronger evidence and more sound reasoning to support yourclaim.There are some arguments that use a formal or deductive structure and containfallacies of form that are objective fallacies, that is, they are alwaysfallacious in all situations. For example:> All humans are mortal.> Phil is mortal.> Therefore, Phil is a human.Actually, Phil is a groundhog. This is an example of a syllogistic fallacy,and it always will be, in all situations. Even if Phil were human, the form ofthe argument would still commit the fallacy. In formal logic, the truth of thepremises guarantee the truth of the conclusion.The bottom line: never insist that an informal argument is definitelyfallacious, and be prepared to defend your arguments against claims of fallacy.Tip: In 2004, I wrote the book, Year To Success, a book Donald Trump called, “aninspiration to anyone who reads it.” (Yes, I’ll drop the names when I can!) Inthat book, I explain how success is like a game of chance where you control theodds by continually replacing behaviors that pull you away from success withbehaviors that bring you closer to success. When appropriate, I include a tipthat is relevant to the fallacy, that will bring you closer to success – most ofwhich are serious, but some... not so much (you will know the difference).Variation(s). There are some variations or forms of the fallacies that arelisted in the aliases for the fallacy name, but I feel deserve a bit ofexplanation when it comes to the differences.Let’s get started!"},{"pageContent":" Logically Fallacious The Ultimate Collection of Over 300 Logical Fallacies "},{"pageContent":"Accident Fallacya dicto simpliciter ad dictum secundum quid(also known as: destroying the exception, dicto secundum quid ad dictumsimpliciter, dicto simpliciter, converse accident, reverse accident, fallacy ofthe general rule, sweeping generalization)Description: When an attempt is made to apply a general rule to all situations,when clearly there are exceptions to the rule. Simplistic rules or laws rarelytake into consideration legitimate exceptions, and to ignore these exceptions isto bypass reason to preserve the illusion of a perfect law. People likesimplicity and would often rather keep simplicity at the cost of rationality.Logical Form:> X is a common and accepted rule.> Therefore, there are no exceptions to X.Example #1:> I believe one should never deliberately hurt another person, that’s why I can> never be a surgeon.Explanation: Classifying surgery under “hurting” someone, is to ignore theobvious benefits that go with surgery. These kind of extreme views are rarelybuilt on reason.Example #2:> The Bible clearly says, “thou shall not bear false witness”, therefore, as a> Christian, you better answer the door and tell our drunk neighbor with the> shotgun, that his wife, who he is looking to kill, is hiding in our basement,> otherwise you are defying God himself!Explanation: To assume any law, even divine, applies to every person, in everytime, in every situation, even though not explicitly stated, is an assumptionnot grounded in evidence, and fallacious reasoning.Exception: Stating the general rule when a good argument can be made that theaction in question is a violation of the rule, would not be consideredfallacious.> The Bible says, “thou shall not murder”, therefore, as a Christian, you better> put that chainsaw down and untie that little kid.Tip: It is your right to question laws you don’t understand or laws with whichyou don’t agree. "},{"pageContent":"Ad Fidentiaargumentum ad fidentia(also known as: against self-confidence)Description: Attacking the person’s self-confidence in place of the argument orthe evidence.Logical Form:> Person 1 claims that Y is true, but is person 1 really sure about that?> Therefore, Y is false.Example #1:> Rick: I had a dream last night that I won the lottery! I have $1000 saved> up, so I am buying 1000 tickets!> Vic: You know, dreams are not accurate ways to predict the future; they are> simply the result of random neurons firing.> Rick: The last time I checked, you are no neurologist or psychologist, so how> sure are you that I am not seeing the future?> Vic: It’s possible you can be seeing the future, I guess.Explanation: Although Vic is trying to reason with his friend, Rick attempts toweaken Vic’s argument by making Vic more unsure of his position. This is afallacious tactic by Rick and if Vic falls for it, fallacious reasoning on hispart.Example #2:> Chris: You claim that you don’t believe in the spirit world that is all around> us, with spirits coming in and out of us all the time. But, how can you be> sure this is not the case? Are you 100% certain?> Joe: Of course not, how can I be?> Chris: Exactly! One point for me! Biotch!> Joe: What?Explanation: This is a common fallacy among those who argue for the supernaturalor anything else not falsifiable[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_177.html#filepos713385]. If Joe werenot that reasonable of a thinker, he may start to question the validity of hisposition, not based on any new counter evidence presented, but a direct attackon his self-confidence. Fortunately for Joe, he holds no dogmatic beliefs andis perfectly aware of the difference between possibilities and probabilities(see also appeal to possibility[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_039.html#filepos216753]).Exception: When one claims certainty for something where certainty isunknowable, it is your duty to point it out.Tip: Have confidence that you are probably or even very probably right, butavoid dogmatic certainty at all costs in areas where certainty is unknowable."},{"pageContent":"Ad Hoc Rescuead hoc(also known as: making shit up*, MSU fallacy*)Description: Very often we desperately want to be right and hold on to certainbeliefs, despite any evidence presented to the contrary. As a result we beginto make up excuses as to why our belief could still be true, and is still true,despite the fact that we have no real evidence for what we are making up.Logical Form:> Claim X is true because of evidence Y.> Evidence Y is demonstrated to not be acceptable evidence.> Therefore, it must be guess Z then, even though there is no evidence for guess> Z.Example #1:> Frieda: I just know that Raymond is just waiting to ask me out.> Edna: He has been seeing Rose for 3 months now.> Frieda: He is just seeing her to make me jealous.> Edna: They’re engaged.> Frieda: Well, that’s just his way of making sure I know about it.Explanation: Besides being a bit deluded, poor Frieda refuses to accept theevidence that leads to a truth she is not ready to accept. As a result, shecreates an ad hoc reason in an attempt to rescue her initial claim.Example #2:> Mark: God loves us so much, that he sacrificed his only son, Jesus, so we> could be free from Sin! Praise Jesus!> Sam: Why was God sacrificing Jesus to himself? Couldn’t he just have> forgiven us?> Mark: Perhaps this was the most effective way.Explanation: In absence of an official and sensible answer, in this case, ananswer in the book that tells the story (the Bible), one was made up. It couldbe true, but there is absolutely no reason to accept it as true. Exception: Proposing possible solutions is perfectly acceptable when an argumentis suggesting only a possible solution – especially in a hypothetical situation.For example, “If there is no God, then life is meaningless.” No, if there isno God who dictates meaning to our lives, perhaps we are truly free to find ourown meaning.Tip: When you suspect people are just making stuff up, rather than providingevidence to support their claim, simply ask them, “What evidence do you have tosupport that?”"},{"pageContent":"Ad Hominem (Abusive)argumentum ad hominem(also known as: personal abuse, personal attacks, abusive fallacy, damning thesource, name calling, needling [form of], refutation by character)Description: Attacking the person making the argument, rather than the argumentitself, when the attack on the person is completely irrelevant to the argumentthe person is making.Logical Form:> Person 1 is claiming Y.> Person 1 is a moron.> Therefore, Y is not true.Example #1:> My opponent suggests that lowering taxes will be a good idea – this is coming> from a woman who eats a pint of Ben and Jerry’s each night!Explanation: The fact that the woman loves her ice cream, has nothing to do withthe lowering of taxes, and therefore, is irrelevant to the argument. Adhominem attacks are usually made out of desperation when one cannot find adecent counter argument.Example #2:> Tony wants us to believe that the origin of life was an “accident”. Tony is> a godless SOB who has spent more time in jail then in church, so the only> information we should consider from him is the best way to make license> plates.Explanation: Tony may be a godless SOB. Perhaps he did spend more time in thejoint than in church. But all this is irrelevant to his argument or truth ofhis claim as to the origin of life.Exception: When the attack on the person is relevant to the argument, it is nota fallacy. In our first example, if the issue being debated was theelimination of taxes only on Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, then pointing out hereating habits would be strong evidence of a conflict of interest.Tip: When others verbally attack you, take it as a compliment to the quality ofyour argument. It is usually a sign of desperation on their part.Variation: Needling is attempting to make the other person angry, takingattention off of the argument and perhaps even making the other person lookfoolish."},{"pageContent":"Ad Hominem (Circumstantial)argumentum ad hominem(also known as: appeal to motive, conflict of interest, appeal to personalinterest, argument from motives, questioning motives, vested interest)Description: Suggesting that the person who is making the argument is biased, orpredisposed to take a particular stance, and therefore, the argument isnecessarily invalid.Logical Form:> Person 1 is claiming Y.> Person 1 has a vested interest in Y being true.> Therefore, Y is false.Example #1:> Salesman: This car gets better than average gas mileage, and is one of the> most reliable cars according to Consumer Reports.> Will: I doubt it – you obviously just want to sell me that car.Explanation: The fact that the salesmen has a vested interest and selling Willthe car, does not mean that he is lying. He may be, but this is not somethingyou can conclude solely on his interests. It is reasonable to assume thatsalespeople sell the products and services they do because they believe in them.Example #2:> Of course your minister says he believes in God. He would be unemployed> otherwise.Explanation: The fact atheist ministers are about as in demand as hookers who,“just want to be friends”, does not mean that ministers believe in God justbecause they need a job.Exception: As the bias or conflict of interest becomes more relevant to theargument, usually signified by a lack of other evidence, the argument is seen asless of a fallacy and more as a legitimate motive. For example, courtesy ofMeat Loaf...> Girl: Will you love me forever?> Boy: Let me sleep on it!!!> Girl: Will you love me forever!!!> Boy: I couldn't take it any longer> Lord I was crazed> And when the feeling came upon me> Like a tidal wave> I started swearing to my god and on my mother's grave> That I would love you to the end of time> I swore that I would love you to the end of time!Tip: When you know you have something to gain from a position you hold(assuming, of course, you are not guilty of this fallacy for holding theposition), be upfront about it and bring it up before someone else does.> Supporting this cause is the right thing to do.

This is the same> policy that all those extreme feminist groups support. Extremists like> Delores should not be taken seriously – at least politically.Explanation: Making the assumption that Delores is an extreme feminist simplybecause she supports a policy that virtually every man and woman also support,is fallacious.Example #2:> Pol Pot, the Cambodian Maoist revolutionary, was against religion, and he was> a very bad man. Frankie is against religion, therefore, Frankie, too, must> be a very bad man.Explanation: The fact that Pol Pot and Frankie share one particular view doesnot mean they are identical in other ways unrelated, specifically, being a verybad man. Pol Pot was not a bad man because he was against religion, he was abad man for his genocidal actions.Exception: If one can demonstrate that the connection between the twocharacteristics that was inherited by association is causally linked, or theprobability of taking on a characteristic would be high, then it would be valid.> Pol Pot, the Cambodian Maoist revolutionary, was genocidal, therefore, he was> a very bad man. Frankie is genocidal, therefore, Frankie too, must be a very> bad man."},{"pageContent":"Ad Hominem (Tu quoque)argumentum ad hominem tu quoque(also known as: “you too” fallacy, hypocrisy, personal inconsistency)Description: Claiming the argument is flawed by pointing out that the one makingthe argument is not acting consistently with the claims of the argument.Logical Form:> Person 1 is claiming that Y is true, but person 1 is acting as if Y is not> true.> Therefore, Y must not be true.Example #1:> Helga: You should not be eating that... it has been scientifically proven that> eating fat burgers are no good for your health.> Hugh: You eat fat burgers all the time, so that can’t be true.Explanation: It doesn’t matter, to the truth claim of the argument at least, ifHelga follows her own advice or not. While it might appear that the reason shedoes not follow her own advice is because she doesn’t believe it’s true, itcould also be that those fat burgers are just too damn irresistible.Example #2:> Jimmy Swaggart argued strongly against sexual immorality, yet he has had> several affairs with prostitutes, therefore, sexual immorality is acceptable.Explanation: The fact Jimmy Swaggart likes to play a round of bedroom golf withsome local entrepreneurial ladies, is not evidence for sexual immorality ingeneral, only that he is sexually immoral.Exception: If Jimbo insisted that his actions were in line with sexual morality,then it would be a very germane part of the argument.Tip: Again, admit when your lack of self-control or will-power has nothing to dowith the truth claim of the proposition. The following is what I remember mydad telling me about smoking (he smoked about 4 packs a day since he was 14).> Bo, never be a stupid a–hole like me and start smoking.

Formal fallacies can be confusing and complex, and are not as common ineveryday situations, so please don’t feel “lost” when reading through the formalfallacies – do your best to understand them, as I do my best to make themunderstandable.New Terminology:> Syllogism: an argument typically consisting of three parts: a major premise, a> minor premise, and a conclusion.> Categorical Term: usually expressed grammatically as a noun or noun phrase,> each categorical term designates a class of things.> Categorical Proposition: joins together exactly two categorical terms and> asserts that some relationship holds between the classes they designate.> Categorical Syllogism: an argument consisting of exactly three categorical> propositions: a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion, in which> there appear a total of exactly three categorical terms, each of which is used> exactly twice.Description: The conclusion of a standard form categorical syllogism isaffirmative, but at least one of the premises is negative. Any valid forms ofcategorical syllogisms that assert a negative premise must have a negativeconclusion.Logical Form:> Any form of categorical syllogism with an affirmative conclusion and at least> one negative premise.Example #1:> No people under the age of 66 are senior citizens.> No senior citizens are children.> Therefore, all people under the age of 66 are children.Explanation: In this case, the conclusion is obviously counter factual althoughboth premises are true. Why? Because this is a categorical syllogism wherewe have one or more negative premises (i.e. “no people...” and “no seniorcitizens...”) and we are attempting to draw a positive (affirmative) conclusion(i.e. “all people...”). Example #2:> No donkeys are fish.> Some asses are donkeys.> Therefore, some asses are fish.Explanation: This is a categorical syllogism where we have a single negativepremise (i.e. “no donkeys”) and we are attempting to draw a positive(affirmative) conclusion (i.e. “some asses”).Exception: None."},{"pageContent":"Affirming a Disjunct(also known as: the fallacy of the alternative disjunct, false exclusionarydisjunct, affirming one disjunct, the fallacy of the alternative syllogism,asserting an alternative, improper disjunctive syllogism, fallacy of thedisjunctive syllogism)New Terminology:> Disjunction: A proposition of the \"either/or\" form, which is true if one or> both of its propositional components is true; otherwise, it is false.> Disjunct: One of the propositional components of a disjunction.Description: Making the false assumption that when presented with an either/orpossibility, that if one of the options is true that the other one must befalse.

I did not have to follow the, “if it’s yellow, let it mellow”rule – in fact, if I did follow that rule I would probably still be single. The stated rule is simply, “if it’s brown” (the antecedent), then (implied),“flush it down” (the consequent). From this, we cannot imply that we can ONLYflush it down if it is brown.

This may seemlike common sense to those who make the claim, and to many who hear the claim,but there are many people on this earth who do not share that view, and need tobe convinced first.Example #2:> Everyone knows that without religion, we all would be like lost sheep.Explanation: Everyone does not know that. Sometimes, without stepping outsideyour own social sphere, it might seem like what you might accept as universaltruths are simply truths within your own social sphere. Don’t assume universaltruths.Exception: Facts that would seem foolish not to assume, can be assumed – but oneshould be prepared to support the assumption, no matter how certain one may be.> We all know that without water we cannot survive.Tip: Replace the word “certain” in your life with “extremely probable”.Variation: The appeal to common sense is asserting that your conclusion or factsare just “common sense”, yet sense is anything but common. We have a tendencyto think that many of our beliefs and opinions are “common sense” when in factthey are not.

This technique is often used insales. Fallacious reasoning would be committed by the person accepting theoptions as the only options, which would most likely be on a subconscious level,since virtually anyone, if they thought about it, would recognize other optionsexist.Example #1:> Max: If you’re not a witch, you have nothing to worry about.

If you do float, then you are made of> wood, you are a witch, and we will hang you.> Gilda: Wait, how is it I have nothing to worry about if I am not a witch?Explanation: The argument is created so that any woman accused of being a witchwill die, certainly a lose-lose situation.Example #2:> Guy on street: Tell me young man, have you accepted Je-sus in your heart? If> not, let’s talk about it. If you have, let’s talk about how you can help> others accept Je-sus!Explanation: Of course, another option is to just ignore the guy and keepwalking, tell the guy, “no thank you”, and keep walking, or grab the guy’sBible, whack him over the head with it, and then keep walking.Exception: If you engage your critical thinking and realize other options exist,and still choose one of the given options, you would not be guilty of fallaciousreasoning.Tip: Whenever you are presented with options, carefully consider the possibilityof other options not mentioned, and propose them."},{"pageContent":"Appeal to Accomplishment(also known as: appeal to success)Description: When the argument being made is sheltered from criticism based onthe level of accomplishment of the one making the argument. A form of thisfallacy also occurs when arguments are evaluated on the accomplishments, orsuccess, of the person making the argument, rather than on the merits of theargument itself.Logical Form:> Person 1 claims that Y is true.> Person 1 is very accomplished.> Therefore, Y is true.> > Person 1 presents evidence against claim Y.> Person 1 is told to shut up until person 1 becomes as accomplished as person> 2.Example #1:> I have been around the block many times, and I have had my share of success. > So believe me when I tell you that there is no better hobby than> cat-juggling.Explanation: We can all admire accomplishment and success, but this isirrelevant to cat-juggling. There are many accomplished and successful peoplewho are immoral, mean, insensitive, hateful, liars, miserable, and just plainwrong about a great many things.Example #2:> I hold a doctorate in theology, have written 12 books, and personally met the> Pope. Therefore, when I say that Jesus’ favorite snack was raisins dipped in> wine, you should believe me.Explanation: While the credentials of the one making the statement are certainlyimpressive, in no way do these credentials lend credibility to the belief thatJesus’ favorite snack was wine-dipped raisins.Exception: When one’s accomplishments are directly related to the argument, itis more meaningful.> I have been around the block many times, and I have had my share of success in> real estate. So believe me when I tell you that, if you know what you are> doing, real estate can be a great way to make a great living.Tip: Many successful people attempt to use their success as a wildcard to be anauthority on everything.

Is it right that the top> 1% have so much when the rest of us have so little? I urge you to vote for> me today!Explanation: This is a common tactic to play on the emotions of others to getthem to do what you want them to do. The fact is, no evidence was given orclaim was made linking your vote with the problems going away. The politicianwill hope you will make the connection, while she can claim innocence down theroad when the people attempt to hold the politician to a promise she reallynever made.Example #2:> How can you possibly think that humans evolved from monkeys! This is> insulting to the God who created you... from dirt.Explanation: Ignoring the fact that we didn’t evolve from monkeys (we share acommon ancestor with modern African apes), the fact that the arguer thinks it is“insulting” is irrelevant to the facts.Exception: Like all appeals to emotion, they work very well when used inaddition to a supported conclusion, not in place of one.> Are you tired of being ignored by your government?

As theaudience, allowing an irrelevant authority to add credibility to the claim beingmade.Logical Form:> According to person 1, Y is true.> Therefore, Y is true.Example #1:> My 5th grade teacher once told me that girls will go crazy for boys if they> learn how to dance. Therefore, if you want to make the ladies go crazy for> you, learn to dance.Explanation: Even if the 5th grade teacher were a expert on relationships, herbelief about what makes girls “go crazy” for boys is speculative, or perhapscircumstantial, at best.Example #2:> The Pope told me that priests can turn bread and wine into Jesus’ body and> blood. The Pope is not a liar. Therefore, priests really can do this.Explanation: The Pope may believe what he says, and perhaps the Pope is not aliar, but the Pope is not an authority on the fact that the bread and wine isactually transformed into Jesus’ body and blood. After all, how much flesh andblood does this guy Jesus actually have to give?Exception: Appealing to authority is valid when the authority is actually alegitimate (debatable) authority on the facts of the argument. In the aboveexample, if Jesus testified that this was actually happening, I guess we’d haveto believe him. The above example demonstrates the kind of subtle differencein being an authority on the idea of transubstantiation vs. the actualeffectiveness of transubstantiation.Tip: Question authority – or become the authority that people look to foranswers.Variation: Testimonials are statements from, “authorities”, in the sense thatthey are said to know about what they are testifying to. In business,vendor-provided testimonials should not be taken too seriously as they caneasily be exceptions to the norm or just made up – as in, “John G. from Ohiosays...”"},{"pageContent":"Appeal to CelebrityDescription: Accepting a claim of a celebrity based on his or her celebritystatus, not on the strength of the argument.Logical Form:> Celebrity 1 says to use product Y.> Therefore, we should use product Y.Example #1:> Tom Cruise says on TV that Billy Boy Butter is the best tasting butter there> is. Tom Cruise is awesome – especially in MI4 when he scaled that building> with only one suction glove, therefore, Billy Boy Butter is the best tasting> butter there is!Explanation: Tom Cruise is awesome (his acting, not his religion), and perhapshe really does think Billy Boy Butter is the best tasting butter there is. ButTom is no more an authority on the taste of butter than anyone else, therefore,to accept the claim without any other evidence or reason, is fallacious.Example #2:> Mike Seaver from that 80’s sitcom, “Growing Pains”, is really cool. He is> now a born-again Christian and apologist for the faith. Therefore, you> should really listen to what he has to say!Explanation: Mike Seaver is awesome, but Kirk Cameron, the actor that plays thatcharacter? Even if Kirk were super duper (which he might be, I don’t knowhim), his views on the truth of religion are equally as valid as yours, oranyone else's who determines the truth through “faith”.Exception: Some celebrity endorsements are authentic, where the celebrities aremotivated by the love of the product itself, not the huge check they are gettingfor pretending to like the product. When these products are directly relatedto their celebrity status, then this could be seen as a valid (but notsufficient) reason for wanting the product.Honestly, I really can’t think of any examples, but there must be some outthere.Tip: If you are in business and looking for a celebrity to endorse your product,try not to pick one that is likely to be accused of killing his wife and hiswife’s lover, then taking off in a white Bronco."},{"pageContent":"Appeal to Common Beliefargumentum ad populum(also known as: appeal to accepted belief, groupthink, appeal to widespreadbelief, appeal to the masses, appeal to belief, appeal to the majority, argumentby consensus, consensus fallacy, authority of the many, bandwagon fallacy,argumentum ad numerum, appeal to the number, argumentum consensus gentium,appeal to the mob, appeal to the gallery, mob appeal, social conformance, valueof community)Description: When the claim that most or many people in general or of aparticular group accept a belief as true is presented as evidence for the claim.Accepting another person’s belief, or many people’s beliefs, without demandingevidence as to why that person accepts the belief, is lazy thinking and adangerous way to accept information.Logical Form:> A lot of people believe X.> Therefore, X must be true.Example #1: Up until the late 16th century, most people believed that the earthwas the center of the universe. This, of course, is not true.Explanation: The geocentric model was observation (limited) and faith based, butmost who accepted the model did so based on the common and accepted belief ofthe time, not on their own observations, calculations, and or reasoning. Itwas people like Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler, who refused to appeal to commonbelief and uncovered a truth not obvious to the rest of humanity.Example #2:> How could you not believe in virgin births? Roughly two billion people> believe in them, don’t you think you should reconsider your position?Explanation: Anyone who believes in virgin births does not have empiricalevidence for his or her belief. This is a claim accepted on faith, which is anindividual and subjective form of accepting information, that should not haveany effect on your beliefs. Don’t forget that there was a time that the commonbeliefs included a flat earth, earth-centered universe, and demon-possession asthe root cause of most illness.Exception: Sometimes there is good reason to think that the common belief isheld by people who do have good evidence for believing. For example, if 99.7%of all earth scientists believe that the universe is approximately 13.7 billionyears old, it is wise to believe them, because they will be able to presentobjective and empirical evidence as to why they believe.Tip: History has show that those who break away from the common beliefs are theones who change the course of history.

Sure, I have a few private jets and> a home in 12 countries, but I put on my pants one leg at a time, just like you> common people. So believe me when I say, this increase in taxes for the> common folk is just what we all need.Explanation: There is no valid reason given for the increase in taxes.Example #2: The world religions that focus on giving the power to the “commonfolk” – the oppressed, the weak, and the poor, are those that have survived andhave the most adherents.Explanation: By appealing to the common man, religions have managed to getfollowers in large numbers. These appeals, commonly found in religious texts,are not evidence for the truth claims of the religion, yet they are effective inconvincing people to believe the truth claims.Exception: If the “common folk” appeal is made in addition to valid reasons,then it is not a fallacy, although I would argue it is cheap pandering thatpeople are starting to see right through."},{"pageContent":"Appeal to Coincidence(also known as: appeal to luck, appeal to bad luck)Description: Concluding that a result is due to chance when the evidencestrongly suggests otherwise. The appeal to luck variation uses luck in placeof coincidence or chance.Logical Form:> Evidence suggests that X is the result of Y.> Yet one insists that X is the result of chance.Example #1:> Bill: Steve, I am sorry to say, but you are a horrible driver!> Steve: Why do you say that?> Bill: This is your fourteenth accident this year.> Steve: It’s just been an unlucky year for me.Explanation: Based on statistical norms, it is very clear that anyone gettinginto fourteen accidents in a single year has a safety issue as a driver. Ignoring this obvious fact and writing it off as “bad luck”, is seen as theappeal to coincidence.Example #2:> Mom: This is the eighth time you have been sent to the principle’s office this> year. The principle tells me she has seen you more times in her office than> any other student. Why is this?> Dwight: A teacher just happens to sneak up on me whenever I am doing something> against the rules, which is no more often than any other student.Explanation: Dwight is a trouble-maker – that is quite clear. Rather than facethe facts, he is appealing to coincidence by suggesting he just gets caught moreoften due to bad timing.Exception: Coincidences do happen. When the evidence points in the directionof coincidence, the coincidence might be the best option."},{"pageContent":"Appeal to Consequencesargumentum ad consequentiam(also known as: appeal to consequences of a belief, argument to theconsequences, argument from [the] consequences)Description: Concluding that an idea or proposition is true or false because theconsequences of it being true or false are desirable or undesirable. Thefallacy lies in the fact that the desirability is not related to the truth valueof the idea or proposition. This comes in two forms: the positive andnegative. Logical Form:> X is true because if people did not accept X as being true then there would be> negative consequences.> > X is false because if people did not accept X as being false, then there would> be negative consequences.> > X is true because accepting that X is true has positive consequences.> > X is false because accepting that X is false has positive consequences.Example (positive):> If there is objective morality, then good moral behavior will be rewarded> after death. I want to be rewarded, therefore, morality must be objective.Example (negative):> If there is no objective morality, then all the bad people will not be> punished for their bad behavior after death. I don’t like that, therefore,> morality must be objective.Explanation: The fact that one wants to be rewarded, or wants other people tosuffer, says nothing to the truth claim of objective morality. These examplesare also begging the question[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_059.html#filepos296752] that there islife after death.Exception: If it is understood by both parties that an argument is not beingmade, rather it is a warning based on possibilities, and the person issuing thewarning acknowledges it is not evidence for the claim, then there is nofallacy. The problem is, virtually every such warning has an implied argument,so it is very debatable what is fallacious or not. For example:> Peter: I know it’s not evidence for Jesus’ existence, but I believe in Jesus> because I am not risking an eternity of suffering. That’s why I think you> should too!> Carl: What if Allah exists, and as it says in the Koran, if you believe Jesus> was divine you will spend eternity in Hell?> Peter: Oh shit.Tip: Realize that you can deal with reality, no matter what that reality turnsout to be. You don’t need to hide from it – face it head on."},{"pageContent":"Appeal to Definition*(also known as: appeal to the dictionary)Definition: Using a dictionary’s limited definition of a term as evidence thatterm cannot have another meaning, expanded meaning, or even conflictingmeaning. This is a fallacy because dictionaries don’t reason; they simply area reflection of an abbreviated version of the current accepted usage of a term,as determined through argumentation and eventual acceptance. In short,dictionaries tell you what a word meant, according to the authors, at the timeif its writing, not what it meant before that time, after, or what it shouldmean.Dictionary meanings are usually concise and lack the depth found in anencyclopedia, therefore, terms found in dictionaries are often incomplete whenit comes to helping people to gain a full understanding of the term.Logical Form:> The dictionary definition of X does not mention Y.> Therefore, Y must not be part of X.Example #1:> Ken: Do you think gay marriage should be legalized?> Paul: Absolutely not! Marriage is defined as the union between a man and a> woman – not between two men or two women!> Ken: Did you know that in 1828, the dictionary definition of marriage> included, “for securing the maintenance and education of children”? Does> that mean that all married couples who can’t or choose not to have children> aren’t really married?> Paul: No, it just means they need to buy an updated dictionary.> Ken: As do you. The current Mariam-Webster dictionary includes as a> secondary definition, “the state of being united to a person of the same sex> in a relationship like that of a traditional marriage.”Explanation: The dictionary does not settle controversial issues such as gaymarriage – it simply reports the most current accepted definition of the termitself while usually attempting to remain neutral on such controversial issues.Example #2:> Armondo: Mrs. Patterson was wrong to knock off 10 points off my oral> presentation because I kept using the word, “erection” instead of building.> Felix: That was hilarious, but did you honestly think you would not get in> trouble?> Armondo: No, my dictionary says that an erection is a building.Explanation: Armondo may be right, but the dictionary is not the final authorityon all issues, especially social behavior. More modern usage, especially in ahigh school setting, takes precedence in this case.Exception: The dictionary works well when the term in question is a result of amisunderstanding or ignorance. For example:> Ken: Do you accept biological evolution?> Paul: No. Because I know for a fact that my grandmother was not a monkey.> Ken: Good Lord.Tip: Don’t be afraid to argue with authority if you believe you are right – evenwhen that authority is the dictionary."},{"pageContent":"Appeal to DesperationDescription: Arguing that your conclusion, solution, or proposition is rightbased on the fact that something must be done, and your solution is something.Logical Form:> Something must be done.> X is something,> Therefore, X must be done.Example #1:> These are desperate times, and desperate times call for desperate measures. > Therefore, I propose we exterminate all baby seals. It is obvious that> something must be done, and this is something.Explanation: No reason is given for why we should exterminate all baby seals. Perhaps the reason is that they all have a virus that will spread to the humanrace and kill us all, perhaps exterminating all baby seals will leave more fishfor the humans, or perhaps exterminating all baby seals will be a way to finallyput an end to the clubbing of baby seals – but without these or any otherreasons given, we have nothing to go on except the desperation that somethingmust be done.Example #2:> Chairman: We are out of money come Monday. Any suggestions?> Felix: I suggest we take what money we do have, and go to Disney World.> Chairman: Any other suggestions?> (silence)> Chairman: Since there are no other suggestions, Disney World it is.Explanation: Desperate times don’t necessarily call for any measure over nomeasure. Many times, no action is better than a bad action. Blowing whatmoney is left on over-priced soft drinks and what appears to be rotisserieostrich legs, may not be a wise choice – especially when investors are involved.Exception: At times, especially in situations where time is limited, taking someaction will be better than taking no action, and in absence of better reasoning,the best available reason might have to do. However, a reason, no matter howpoor, should still be given – not simply a conclusion.Tip: Do your best to avoid situations of desperation where emotion very oftentakes the lead over reason. Although not all desperate situations can beavoided, many can, by proper planning and foresight."},{"pageContent":"Appeal to Emotion(also known as: playing on emotions, emotional appeal, for the children)Description: This is the general category of many fallacies that use emotion inplace of reason in order to attempt to win the argument. It is a type ofmanipulation used in place of valid logic.There are several specifically emotional fallacies that I list separately inthis book, because of their widespread use. But keep in mind that you can takeany emotion, precede it with, “appeal to”, and you have created a new fallacy. But by definition, the emotion must be used in place of a valid reason insupporting the conclusion.Logical Form:> X must be true.> Imagine how sad it would be if it weren’t true.Example #1:> Power lines cause cancer. I met a little boy with cancer who lived just 20> miles from a power line who looked into my eyes and said, in his weak voice,> “Please do whatever you can so that other kids won’t have to go through what I> am going through.” I urge you to vote for this bill to tear down all power> lines and replace them with monkeys on treadmills.Explanation: Notice the form of the example: assertion, emotional appeal,request for action (conclusion) – nowhere is there any evidence presented. Wecan all tear up over the image of a little boy with cancer who is expressingconcern for others, rather than taking pity on himself, but that has nothing todo with the assertion or the conclusion.Example #2:> There must be objective rights and wrongs in the universe. If not, how can> you possibly say that torturing babies for fun could ever be right?Explanation: The thought of people torturing babies for fun immediately bringsup unpleasant images (in sane people). The actual argument (implied) is thatthere are objective (universal) rights and wrongs (morality). The argument isworded in such a way to connect the argument's conclusions (that there isobjective morality) with the idea that torturing babies for fun is wrong (thisis also a non sequitur fallacy[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_135.html#filepos572381]). No matterhow we personally feel about a horrible act, our feelings are not a validsubstitution for an objective reason behind why the act is horrible.Exception: Appealing to emotions is a very powerful and necessary technique inpersuasion. We are emotional creatures, and, therefore, we often makedecisions and form beliefs erroneously based on emotions, when reason and logictell us otherwise. However, using appeals to emotion as a backup to rationaland logical arguments is not only valid, but a skill possessed by virtuallyevery great communicator. Tip: By appealing to both the brain and the heart, you will persuade thegreatest number of people."},{"pageContent":"Appeal to Extremes(also known as: reductio ad absurdum [misuse of], slippery slope fallacy [formof])Description: Erroneously attempting to make a reasonable argument into an absurdone, by taking the argument to the extremes.Logical Form:> If X is true, then Y must also be true (where Y is the extreme of X)Example #1:> There is no way those Girl Scouts could have sold all those cases of cookies> in one hour. If they did, they would have to make $500 in one hour, which,> based on an 8 hour day is over a million dollars a year. That is more than> most lawyers, doctors, and successful business people make!Explanation: The Girl Scouts worked just for one hour – not 40 per week for ayear. Suggesting the extreme leads to an absurd conclusion; that Girl Scoutsare among the highest paid people in the world. Not to mention, there is awhole troop of them doing the work, not just one girl.Example #2:> Don’t forget God’s commandment, “thou shall not kill”. By using mouthwash,> you are killing 99.9% of the germs that cause bad breath. Prepare for Hell.Explanation: It is unlikely that God had mouthwash on his mind when issuing thatcommand. But if he did, we’re all screwed.Exception: This fallacy is a misuse of one of the greatest techniques inargumentation, reductio ad absurdum[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_150.html#filepos625265], or reducingthe argument to the absurd. The difference is where the absurdity actually is– in the argument or in reasoning of the one trying to show the argument isabsurd.Here is an example of an argument that is proven false by reducing to theabsurd, legitimately.> Big Tony: The more you exercise, the stronger you will get!> Nerdy Ned: Actually, if you just kept exercising and never stopped, you would> eventually drop dead. There is a limit to how much exercise you should get.Tip: People very often say stupid things. Sometimes it is easy to reduce theirargument to absurdity, but remember, in most cases, your goal should bediplomacy, not making the other person look foolish. Especially when dealingwith your wife – unless you really like sleeping on the couch."},{"pageContent":"Appeal to FaithDescription: This is an abandonment of reason in an argument and a call tofaith, usually when reason clearly leads to disproving the conclusion of anargument. It is the assertion that one must have (the right kind of) faith inorder to understand the argument. Even arguments which heavily rely on reason that ultimately require faith,abandon reason.Logical Form:> X is true.> If you have faith, you will see that.Example #1:> Jimmie: How can you possibly associate gentle Jesus with the same God who> says, “I will make my arrows drunk with blood, while my sword devours flesh:> the blood of the slain and the captives, the heads of the enemy leaders.”?> (Deuteronomy 32:42)> Hollie: You are trying to interpret those words through your carnal mind. > You need to read those words through the eyes of faith.> Jimmie: What does that even mean?> Hollie: If you had faith, you would understand.Explanation: There are some things, some believe, that are beyond reason andlogic. Fair enough, but the moment we accept this, absent of any objectivemethod of telling what is beyond reason and why, anything goes. Anything canbe explained away without having to explain anything.Example #2:> Tina: So please explain how Jesus can also be God, yet two separate persons> who talk to each other.> St. Bingo: My child, you will only see that answer clearly through the eyes of> faith.Explanation: It should be obvious that reason and logic are not being used, butrather “faith”. While St. Bingo may be right, there is still no valid reasonoffered. The problem also arises in the vagueness of the appeal to faith. St. Bingo’s answer can be used to answer virtually any question imaginable, yetthe answer is really a deflection.> St. Bingo: You need to massage my feet.> Tina: Why?> St. Bingo: My child, you will only see that answer clearly through the eyes of> faith.Exception: No exceptions – the appeal to faith is always a fallacy when used tojustify a conclusion in absence of reason. "},{"pageContent":"Appeal to Fearargumentum in terrorem(also known as: argumentum ad metum, argument from adverse consequences, scaretactics)Description: When fear, not based on evidence or reason, is being used as theprimary motivator to get others to accept an idea, proposition, or conclusion.Logical Form:> If you don’t accept X as true, something terrible will happen to you.> Therefore, X must be true.Example #1:> If we don’t bail out the big automakers, the US economy will collapse. > Therefore, we need to bail out the automakers.Explanation: There might be plenty of legitimate reasons to bail out theautomakers – reasons based on evidence and probability, a “collapsed economy” isnot one of them.Example #2:> Timmy: Mom, what if I don’t believe in God?> Mom: Then you burn in Hell forever. Why do you ask?> Timmy: No reason.Explanation: Timmy’s faith is waning, but mom, like most moms, is very good atscaring the Hell, in this case, into, Timmy. This is a fallacy because momprovided no evidence that disbelief in God will lead to an eternity of sufferingin Hell. But because the possibility is terrifying to Timmy, he “accepts” theproposition (to believe in God), despite the lack of actual evidence.Exception: When fear is not the primary motivator, but a supporting one, and theprobabilities of the fearful event happening are honestly disclosed, it wouldnot be fallacious.> Timmy: Mom, what if I don’t believe in God?> Mom: Then I would hope that you don’t believe in God for the right reasons,> and not because your father and I didn’t do a good enough job telling you why> you should believe in him, including the possibility of what some believe is> eternal suffering in Hell.> Timmy: That’s a great answer mom. I love you. You are so much better than> my mom in the other example.Tip: Think in terms of probabilities, not possibilities.

This fallacy is often the cause of people getting tricked intodoing something they don’t really want to do.Logical Form:> X is true.> (flattery goes here)> Therefore, X is true.Example #1:> You should certainly be the one who washes the dishes – you are just so good> at it!Explanation: You may be great at washing dishes, but that fact in itself is nota sufficient reason for you being the one to actually wash the dishes. Is itnecessary for someone as skilled at dish-washing as you to do the job? Or isit a mindless job that anyone can do just fine?Example #2:> Salesguy: You should definitely buy this car. You look so good in it – you> look at least ten years younger behind that wheel.> Tamera: I’ll take it!Explanation: The comment about looking ten years younger – just because of thecar, is obvious flattery and not a fact. This would not qualify as a validreason for making such a purchase.Exception: Sincere praise is not flattery, and is universally appreciated5[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_187.html#filepos772411]. But evenpraise in itself, without reason, is a fallacy, unless the argument is directlyrelated to the sincere praise.> You are a stunningly beautiful girl – you should be a model.Tip: Flattery might get you somewhere, but it’s usually a place you don’t wantto be.Variation: The appeal to snobbery is an attempt to make one feel part of theelite if they accept the claim. The proof surrogate is a more general fallacythat substitutes any distracting claim for one of proof – usually flattery isused."},{"pageContent":"Appeal to Forceargumentum ad baculum(also known as: argument to the cudgel, appeal to the stick, argument byvehemence [form of])Description: When force, coercion, or even a threat of force is used in place ofa reason in attempt to justify a conclusion.Logical Form:> If you don’t accept X as true, I will hurt you.Example #1:> Melvin: Boss, why do I have to work weekends when nobody else in the company> does?> Boss: Am I sensing insubordination? I can find another employee very> quickly, thanks to Craigslist, you know.Explanation: Melvin has asked a legitimate question to which he did not get alegitimate answer, rather his question was deflected by a threat of force (asbeing forced out of his job).Example #2:> Jordan: Dad, why do I have to spend my summer at Jesus camp?> Dad: Because if you don’t, you will spend your entire summer in your room with> nothing but your Bible!Explanation: Instead of a reason, dad gave Jordan a description of a punishmentthat would happen.Exception: If the force, coercion, or threat of force is not being used asreason but as a fact or consequence, then it would not be fallacious, especiallywhen a legitimate reason is given with the “threat”, direct or implied. > Melvin: Boss, why do I have to wear this goofy-looking hardhat?> Boss: It is state law, therefore, company policy. No hat, no job.Tip: Unless you are an indentured servant (slave) or still living with yourparents (slave), do not allow others to force you into accepting something astrue.Variation: Argument by vehemence is being very loud in place of being right. This is a form of force, or basically frightening your opponent intosubmission."},{"pageContent":"Appeal to Heavendeus vult(also known as: gott mit uns, manifest destiny, special covenant)Description: Asserting the conclusion must be accepted because it is the “willof God” or “the will of the gods”. In the mind of those committing thefallacy, and those allowing to pass as a valid reason, the will of God is notonly knowable, but the person making the argument knows it, and no other reasonis necessary.Logical Form:> God wants us to X.> Therefore, we should X.Example #1:> Judge: So why did you chop those people into little pieces and put the pieces> in a blender?> Crazy Larry: Because God told me to do it.> Judge: Good enough for me. Next case!Explanation: We should all be thankful that our legal system does not work thisway, but human thinking does. Every day, people do things or don’t do thingsaccording to what they believe is the will of their God. Fortunately, most ofthe time, this does not include a blender.Example #2:> Ian: Why is the story of Abraham and Isaac regarded as such a “beautiful”> Christian story? The guy was about to burn his son alive as a human> sacrifice!> Wallace: Because it was the will of God that Abraham was following, no matter> how difficult it was for him. Isn’t that beautiful?> Ian: I guess as long as it was the will of God, being asked to burn children> alive is a beautiful thing.Explanation: One needs to ask, how do you know it is the will of God? Satan issaid to be the great deceiver – he would only be great if those being deceivedcouldn’t tell the difference between God and Satan. In reality, appealing toHeaven, or God, is an abandonment of logic and reason, and as we have seen,potentially extremely dangerous.Exception: When the supposed, “will of God”, is in line with what someone wouldalready do or believe based on reason, no fallacy is committed.> I choose not to kill other people because I would not want them choosing to> kill me, plus, I don’t believe that God wouldn’t like it if I did.Tip: Sometimes the only difference between faithfulness and insanity, isadherence to the law."},{"pageContent":"Appeal to the Moon(also known as: bad analogy [form of])Description: Using the argument, “If we can put a man on the moon, we could...”as evidence for the argument.Logical Form:> If we can put a man on the moon, we can X.Example #1:> If we can put a man on the moon, we can cure all forms of cancer.Explanation: This is a form of a weak analogy[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_180.html#filepos722993]. Putting aman on the moon is seen to be a virtually impossible task, but since we did it,the (faulty) reasoning is we can then do any virtually impossible task. Remember that mere possibility is not the same as probability. These kind ofarguments are not suggesting mere possibility, but probability, based on thefact that we succeeded getting a man on the moon.Example #2:> If NASA can put a man on the moon, you can certainly sleep with me tonight.Explanation: This is an even worse analogy, taking the “we” out that the analogyhad in common and replacing it with “NASA” and “you”. Now, it really makes nosense in the least bit, but I bet that someone, somewhere, will be convinced byit.Exception: If the argument is for getting a man on the moon again, then thiswould work.> If we can put a man on the moon in 1969, we can do it today.Tip: Believe in the possible – just don’t count on it unless it is probable."},{"pageContent":"Appeal to NatureArgumentum ad NaturamDescription: When used as a fallacy, the belief or suggestion that “natural” isalways better than “unnatural”. Many people adopt this as a default belief.The appeal to nature fallacy should not be confused with the naturalisticfallacy [CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_130.html#filepos554145]. Through confused online sources, the two have become synonymous. But if youwant to impress your friends, insist that the two are very different and tellthem why.Logical Form:> X is natural.> Y is not natural.> Therefore, X is better than Y.Example #1:> I shop at Natural Happy Sunshine Store (NHSS), which is much better than your> grocery store, because at NHSS, everything is natural, including the 38 year> old store manager’s long grey hair and saggy breasts.Explanation: I can appreciate natural food and products as much as the nextgranola-eating guy, but to make any claim of “betterness”, one needs toestablish criteria by which to judge. Perhaps not paying almost twice as muchfor the same general foods is “better” for me. Perhaps I prefer a littleinsecticide on my apple to insects inside my apple. And maybe I like fauxbrunettes with perky breasts due to “unnatural” bra support.Natural is not always “better”.Example #2:> Cocaine is all natural, therefore, it is good for you.Explanation: There are a very many things in this world that are “all natural”and very bad for you besides cocaine, including, earthquakes, monsoons andviruses, just to name a few. Whereas “unnatural” things such as aspirin,pacemakers, and surgery can be very good things.Exception: There are many natural things that are better than unnatural, butthey must be evaluated based on other criteria besides the “naturalness”.Tip: Keep in mind that Mother Nature is the kind of mother who wouldn’t hesitateto throw you in a dumpster and leave you there to die."},{"pageContent":"Appeal to Noveltyargumentum ad novitatem(also known as: appeal to the new, ad novitam [sometimes spelled as])Description: Claiming that something that is new or modern is superior to thestatus quo, based exclusively on its newness.Logical Form:> X has been around for years now.> Y is new.> Therefore, Y is better than X.Example #1:> Two words: New Coke.Explanation: Those who lived through the Coca-Cola identity crises of the mideighties, know what a mess it was for the company. In fact, the “New CokeDisaster”, as it is commonly referred to, is literally a textbook example ofattempting to fix what isn’t broken. Coke’s main marketing ploy was appealingto the novelty, and it failed miserably – even though more people (55%) actuallypreferred the taste of the New Coke, the old was “better”.Example #2:> Bill: Hey, did you hear we have a new operating system out now? It is better> than anything else out there, because we just released it!> Steve: What’s it called?> Bill: Windows Vista!> Steve: Sounds wonderful! I can’t wait until all of your users install it on> all their computers!Explanation: For anyone who went through the experience of Vista, this fallacyshould hit very close to home. You were most likely assuming that you weregetting a superior product to your old operating system – you were thinking“upgrade”, when in fact, those who stuck with the status quo (Windows XP) weremuch better off.Exception: There are obvious exceptions, like in claiming that your fresh milkis better than your month old milk, that is now growing legs in yourrefrigerator.Tip: Diets and exercise programs/gadgets are notorious for preying on our desirefor novelty. Don’t be swayed by the “latest research” or latest fads. Justremember this: burn more calories than you take in, and you will lose weight."},{"pageContent":"Appeal to Pityargumentum ad miserecordiam(also known as: appeal to sympathy, the Galileo argument [form of])Description: The attempt to distract from the truth of the conclusion by the useof pity.Logical Form:> Person 1 is accused of Y, but person 1 is pathetic.> Therefore, person 1 is innocent.> > X is true because person 1 worked really hard at making X true.Example #1:> I really deserve an “A” on this paper, professor. Not only did I study> during my grandmother’s funeral, I also passed up the heart transplant> surgery, even though that was the first matching donor in 3 years.Explanation: The student deserves an “A” for effort and dedication, butunfortunately papers are not graded that way. The fact that we should pity herhas nothing to do with the quality of the paper written, and if we were toadjust the grade because of the sob stories, we would have fallen victim to theappeal to pity.Example #2:> Jesus must be God – look at how much he suffered!Explanation: Jesus may be God, but not because he suffered. There are millionsof people in this world that suffer much worse and for much longer, than Jesusdid, but that doesn’t make them all God.Exception: Like any argument, if it is agreed that logic and reason should takea backseat to emotion, and there is no objective truth claim being made, butrather an opinion of something that should or should not be done, then it couldescape the fallacy.> Jesus suffered horribly on the cross. Therefore, we should feel empathy> towards him.Tip: Avoid pity in argumentation. It is a clear indicator that you have weakevidence for your argument.Variation: The Galileo argument requests pity for unusual claims, like that ofGalileo’s sun-centered solar system, without providing sufficient evidence forthe claims."},{"pageContent":"Appeal to Popularityargumentum ad numeram(also known as: bandwagon argument, peer pressure)Description: Using the popularity of a premise or proposition as evidence forits truthfulness. This is a fallacy which is very difficult to spot becauseour “common sense” tells us that if something is popular, it must begood/true/valid. But this is not so, especially in a society where clevermarketing, social and political weight, and money can buy popularity.Logical Form:> Everybody is doing X.> Therefore, X must be the right thing to do.Example #1:> Mormonism is one of the fastest growing sects of Christianity today, so that> whole story about Joseph Smith getting the gold plates, that unfortunately> disappeared back into heaven, must be true!Explanation: Moronism is indeed rapidly growing, but that fact does not provethe truth claims made by Mormonism in any way.Example #2:> Out of all the religions, Christianity is most likely the one true religion> because it is by far the most popular worldwide. It has been growing strong> since the time of Constantine.Explanation: Indeed Christianity is popular, and has seen a strong and steadygrowth in the last 1700+ years. But this is not evidence that it is true – itis just evidence that it is popular. There are many factors that lead to thegrowth of Christianity including breeding and children being raised Christian,promises of Heaven and the threat of Hell, the strong emphasis on the importanceof being evangelical, and more.Exception: When the claim being made is about the popularity or some relatedattribute that is a direct result of its popularity.> People seem to love the movie, The Shawshank Redemption. In fact, it is> currently ranked #1 at IMDB.com, based on viewer ratings.Tip: Avoid this fallacy like you avoid a kiss from your great aunt with the bigcold sore on her lip.Variation: The bandwagon effect is a related cognitive bias that demonstratespeople tend to believe and do things because many other people do as well. This is also referred to as “herd behavior” and “groupthink”."},{"pageContent":"Appeal to Possibility(also known as: appeal to probability)Description: When a conclusion is assumed not because it is probably true, butbecause it is possible that it is true, no matter how improbable.Logical Form:> X is possible.> Therefore, X is true.Example #1:> Brittany: I haven’t applied to any other schools besides Harvard.> Casey: You think that is a good idea? After all, you only have a 2.0 GPA,> your SAT scores were pretty bad, and frankly, most people think you are not> playing with a full deck.> Brittany: Are you telling me that it is impossible for me to get in?> Casey: Not *impossible*, but...> Brittany: Then shut your trap.Explanation: Yes, it is possible that Harvard will accept Brittany to fill somesympathy quota, or perhaps someone at admissions will mix Brittany up with“Britney”, the 16-year-old Asian with the 4.0 average who also discovered avaccine for a rare flu in her spare time. But because Brittany is appealing topossibility, she is committing this fallacy.Example #2:> Dave: Did you know that Jesus was gay?> Tim: And why do you say that?> Dave: You have to admit, it is possible!> Tim: So is the fact that you are a moron.Explanation: We cannot assume Jesus was gay based on the possibility alone. This also includes the argument from ignorance[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_052.html#filepos268418] fallacy –concluding a possibility based on missing information (an outright statementthat Jesus was a heterosexual).Exception: When something is argued to be impossible, arguing that it ispossible, no matter how improbable, is perfectly acceptable.Tip: Catch yourself every time you are about to use the word “impossible”. Yes, there are many things that are logically and physically impossible, and itis a valid concept and word, but so often we use that word when we really mean“improbable”. Confusing the impossible with the improbable or unlikely, could,in many cases, destroy the possibility of great success."},{"pageContent":"Appeal to Ridiculereductio ad ridiculum(also known as: appeal to mockery, the horse laugh)Description: Presenting the argument in such a way that makes the argument lookridiculous, usually by misrepresenting the argument or the use of exaggeration.Logical Form:> Person 1 claims that X is true.> Person 2 makes X look ridiculous, by misrepresenting X.> Therefore, X is false.Example #1:> It takes faith to believe in God just like it takes faith to believe in the> Easter bunny – but at least the Easter bunny is based on a creature that> actually exists!Explanation: Comparing the belief in God to belief in the Easter bunny is anattempt at ridicule, and not a good argument. In fact, this type of fallacyusually shows desperation in the one committing the fallacy.Example #2:> Evolution is the idea that humans come from pond scum.Explanation: It is ridiculous to think that we come from pond scum, and it isnot true. It is more accurate to say that we come from exploding stars, asevery atom in our bodies were once in stars. By creating a ridiculous andmisleading image, the truth claim of the argument is overlooked.Exception: It is perfectly legitimate to use ridicule when a position is worthyof ridicule. This is a risky proposition, however, because of thesubjectiveness of what kind of argument is actually ridicule worthy. As wehave seen, misplaced ridicule can appear as a sign of desperation, but carefullyplaced ridicule can be a witty move that can work logically and win over anaudience emotionally as well.> Matt: You close-minded fool! Seeing isn’t believing, believing is seeing!> Cindy: Does that go for the Easter Bunny as well, or just the imaginary beings> of your choice?Tip: Do your best to maintain your composure when someone commits this fallacyat your expense. Remember, they are the ones who have committed the error inreasoning. Tactfully point it out to them."},{"pageContent":"Appeal to Traditionargumentum ad antiquitatem(also known as: appeal to common practice, appeal to antiquity, proof fromtradition, appeal to past practice, gadarene swine fallacy [form of],traditional wisdom)Description: Using historical preferences of the people (tradition), either ingeneral or as specific as the historical preferences of a single individual, asevidence that the historical preference is correct. Traditions are oftenpassed from generation to generation with no other explanation besides, “this isthe way it has always been done” – which is not a reason, it is an absence of areason.Logical Form:> We have been doing X for generations.> Therefore, we should keep doing X.> > Our ancestors thought X was right.> Therefore, X is right.Example #1:> Dave: For five generations, the men in our family when to Stamford and became> doctors, while the women got married and raised children. Therefore, it is> my duty to become a doctor.> Kaitlin: Do you want to become a doctor?> Dave: It doesn’t matter – it is our family tradition. Who am I to break it?Explanation: Just as it takes people to start traditions, it takes people to endthem. A tradition is not reason for action – it is like watching the samemovie over and over again but never asking why you should keep watching it.Example #2:> Marriage has traditionally been between a man and a woman, therefore, gay> marriage should not be allowed.Explanation: Very often traditions stem from religious and/or archaic beliefs,and until people question the logic and reasoning behind such traditions, peoplewho are negatively affected by such traditions will continue to suffer. Justbecause it was acceptable in past cultures and times, does not mean it isacceptable today. Think racism, slavery, and corporal punishment.Exception: Victimless traditions that are persevered for the sake of preservingthe traditions themselves, do not require any other reason.Tip: If it weren’t for the creativity of our ancestors, we would have notraditions. Be creative and start your own traditions that somehow make theworld a better place.Variation: The gadarene swine fallacy refers to the metaphor of planes flying information. If one plane appears out of formation, we assume the one plane iswrong, rather than the other planes actually being on the wrong course. Buthistory tells us at times, the “single planes”, like Martin Luther King Jr.,show us how the rest of us were really just horribly off course."},{"pageContent":"Ambiguity Fallacy(also known as: amphiboly, semantical ambiguity, type-token ambiguity [form of],vagueness)Description: When an unclear phrase with multiple definitions are used withinthe argument, therefore, don’t support the conclusion. Some will say singlewords count for the ambiguity fallacy, which is really a specific form of afallacy known as equivocation[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_078.html#filepos360692].Logical Form:> Claim X is made.> Y is concluded based on an ambiguous understanding of X.Example #1:> It is said that we have a good understanding of our universe. Therefore, we> know exactly how it began and exactly when.Explanation: The ambiguity here is what exactly “good understanding” means. The conclusion assumes a much better understanding than is suggested in thepremise, therefore, we have the ambiguity fallacy.Example #2:> All living beings come from other living beings. Therefore, the first forms> of life must have come from a living being. That living being is God.Explanation: This argument is guilty of two cases of ambiguity. First, thefirst use of the phrase, “come from”, refers to reproduction, whereas the seconduse refers to origin. The fact that we know quite a bit about reproduction isirrelevant when considering origin. Second, the first use of, “living being”,refers to an empirically verifiable, biological, living organism. The seconduse of, “living being”, refers to a belief of an immaterial god. As you cansee, when a term such as, “living being”, describes a do-do bird as well as theall-powerful master of the universe, it has very little meaning and certainly isnot specific enough to draw logical or reasonable conclusions.Exception: Ambiguous phrases are extremely common in the English language and anecessary part of informal logic and reasoning. As long as these ambiguousphrases mean exactly the same thing in all uses of phrase in the argument, thisfallacy is not committed.Variation: The type-token fallacy is committed when a word can refer to either atype (cars) or token (Prius, RAV4, Camry) is used in a way that makes it unclearwhich it refers to, the statement is ambiguous.> Toyota manufactures dozens of cars.This obviously refers to the different types of cars, not how many instances (ortokens) of each car was manufactured."},{"pageContent":"Anonymous Authority(also known as: appeal to anonymous authority)Description: When an unspecified source is used as evidence for the claim. This is commonly indicated by phrases such as “They say that...”, “It has beensaid...”, “I heard that...”, “Studies show...”, or generalized groups such as,“scientists say...” When we fail to specify a source of the authority, wecan’t verify the source, thus the credibility of the argument. Appeals toanonymous sources are more often than not, either a way to fabricate,exaggerate, or misrepresent “facts” in order to deceive others into acceptingyour claim. At times, this deception is done subconsciously – it might notalways be deliberate.Logical Form:> Person 1 once heard that X was true.> Therefore, X is true.Example #1:> You know, they say that if you swallow gum it takes 7 years to digest. So> whatever you do, don’t swallow the gum!Explanation: “They” are wrong as “they” usually are. Gum passes through thesystem relatively unchanged, but does not hang around for 7 years like a collegestudent terrified to get a job. “They” is a common form of appeal to anonymousauthority.Example #2:> The 13.7 billion year-old universe is a big conspiracy. I read this article> once where these notable scientists found strong evidence that the universe> was created 6000 years ago, but because of losing their jobs, they were forced> to keep quiet!Explanation: Without knowing who these scientists are, or the credibility of thesource of the article, we cannot verify the evidence therefore, we should notaccept the evidence.Exception: At times an accepted fact uses the same indicating phrases as theones used for the fallacy, therefore, if the anonymous authority is actuallyjust a statement of an accepted fact, it should be accepted as evidence.> Climate change is happening – and always has been.

Nomatter what you call it, unless you live in certain parts of Nevada (or otherparts of the world), it is still illegal.Exception: Language is powerful and should be used to draw in emotions, butnever at the expense of valid reasoning and evidence."},{"pageContent":"Argument by Fast TalkingDescription: When fast talking is seen as intelligence and/or confidence in thetruth of one’s argument, therefore, seen as evidence of the truth of theargument itself. The fallacy is also committed by the person doing the talkingwhen they are deliberately attempting to not allow the audience enough time toprocess the argument, therefore, either accepting it or at least not rejectingit.Logical Form:> According to person 1, Y is true.> Person 1 speaks very fast.> Therefore, Y is true.Example #1: (to be read extremely fast)> I hereby submit that it is crystal clear that there is only one true God,> without question, without reserve, without hesitation I can say this because I> know the truth and I am here to share it with you. Praise Allah!Explanation: There is absolutely no evidence in the above claim, and if you readit quickly and clearly, you would persuade more people than if you read it likeone of the Beverly Hillbillies. If your intent was to persuade others by notgiving them time to process what you have said, you would be guilty of thisfallacious tactic.Example #2: (same example - to be read extremely fast)> I hereby submit that it is crystal clear that there is only one true God,> without question, without reserve, without hesitation I can say this because I> know the truth and I am here to share it with you. Praise Allah!Explanation: This time, as the one evaluating the argument, if you allow therapid pace of the delivery of the argument to serve as evidence for the claim,you are committing the fallacy. Perhaps the arguer does sound confident,perhaps you are embarrassed to ask him to repeat the argument or slow down,therefore, you just accept it. Either way, that is fallacious reasoning.Exception: Natural fast talkers most likely have no intent to deceive, and ifyou consciously give no undue weight to the claims of a natural fast talker,then no fallacy has been committed.Tip: Work on your pace as a part of your speaking. It should be just slowenough where you do not lose your audience, and no slower, unless going for adramatic effect."},{"pageContent":"Argument by Gibberish(also known as: bafflement, argument by (prestigious) jargon)Description: When incomprehensible jargon or plain incoherent gibberish is usedto give the appearance of a strong argument, in place of evidence or validreasons to accept the argument.The more common form of this argument is when the person making the argumentdefaults to highly technical jargon or details not directly related to theargument, then restates the conclusion.Logical Form:> Person 1 claims that X is true.> Person 1 backs up this claim by gibberish.> Therefore, X is true.Example #1:> Fortifying the dextrose coherence leads to applicable inherence of explicable> tolerance, therefore, we should not accept this proposal.Explanation: I have no idea what I just wrote, and the audience will have noidea either – but the audience (depending on who the audience is) will mostlikely make the assumption that I do know what I am talking about, believe thatthey are incapable of understanding the argument, and therefore, agree with myconclusion since they think I do understand it. This is fallacious reasoning.Example #2:> The Holy Trinity is the union of three separate persons, yet coexist in unity> – they are consubstantial although just one being, sharing a nature yet> distinct, a form of triunity unique to the being of God.Explanation: This is a classic argument from gibberish. Although the wordingmay be different, the argument explains nothing in any meaningful way. Ratherthan exclaiming, “I am sorry, I understand the words, but this makes no sense”,people react in different ways. Maybe it’s because of not wanting to lookignorant. Maybe it’s because they are told they will only understand if theirfaith is strong enough[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_029.html#filepos179041], and they don’twant to admit to not having enough faith.

Don’t try to impress people with fancy words and jargon,when simpler words will do just fine."},{"pageContent":"Argument by Personal Charm(also known as: sex appeal [form of], flamboyance, eloquence)Description: When an argument is made stronger by the personal characteristicsof the person making the argument, often referred to as “charm”.Logical Form:> Person 1 says that Y is true.> Person 1 is very charming.> Therefore, Y is true.Example #1:> Hi there, ladies (wink - teeth sparkle). I just want to say that all of you> have the right to do what you will with your bodies, including the right to> abortion.Explanation: The charm of the arguer is irrelevant to the issue of abortion.Example #2:> Let me start by thanking the wonderful people of this town to host this great> event. I would be honored to call you all my friends. As friends, I want> to tell you that streaking should be legalized.Explanation: Buttering up the audience is actually a technique that is suggested– because it is effective. If you know your argument is weak, and compensateby laying on the charm, you are committing the fallacy. If you are letting thecharm effect your decision, you are also committing the fallacy.Exception: If the argument being made is directly related to the charm of thearguer, as in arguing that he or she would be the better host for a new showwhere charm does matter, then no fallacy has been committed.Tip: If you are a natural charmer, don’t be afraid to use it – just not at theexpense of valid claims and strong evidence."},{"pageContent":"Argument by Repetitionargumentum ad nauseam(also known as: argument from nagging, proof by assertion)Description: Repeating an argument or a premise over and over again in place ofmore supporting evidence.Logical Form:> X is true.

It is> clear that the wisdom contained in this book must be divinely inspired.Explanation: While it might be true that the Bible contains much great wisdom,if one were to examine all the “wisdom” contained in the book, and notselectively choose from passages, then objectively compare this wisdom to anymodern collection of wisdom, one would judge the wisdom on its own merits,without the source bias.> \"I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, she must be> silent.\" 1 Timothy 2:12Exception: When the age is directly related to the truth of the claim, as in,“Wine tastes better with age”.Tip: Remember that even ancient Greeks said stupid things."},{"pageContent":"Argument from Fallacyargumentum ad logicam(also known as: disproof by fallacy, argument to logic, fallacy fallacy, orfallacist's fallacy, bad reasons fallacy [form of], psychogenetic fallacy [formof])Description: Concluding that the truth value of an argument is false based onthe fact that the argument contains a fallacy.Logical Form:> Argument X is fallacious.> Therefore, the conclusion or truth claim or argument X is false.Example #1:> Ivan: You cannot borrow my car because it turns back into a pumpkin at> midnight.> Sidney: If you really think that, you’re and idiot.> Ivan: That is an ad hominem, therefore, I can’t be an idiot.> Sidney: I beg to differ.Explanation: While it is true that Sidney has committed the ad hominem fallacy[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_008.html#filepos96720] by calling Ivanan idiot rather than providing reasons why Ivan’s car won’t turn into a pumpkinat midnight, that fallacy is not evidence against the claim (that Ivan actuallyis an idiot).Example #2:> Karen: I am sorry, but if you think man used to ride dinosaurs, then you are> obviously not very well educated.> Ken: First of all, I hold a PhD in creation science so I am well-educated. > Second of all, your ad hominem attack shows that you are wrong, and man did> used to ride dinosaurs.> Karen: Getting your PhD online in two weeks, from a “college” in a trailer> park, is not being “well-educated”, my fallacy in no way is evidence for man> riding on dinosaurs, and despite what you may think, the Flintstone’s was not> a documentary!Explanation: Karen’s ad hominem fallacy[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_008.html#filepos96720] in her initialstatement has nothing to do with the truth value of the argument that man usedto ride dinosaurs.Exception: At times, fallacies are used by those who can’t find a better way tosupport the truth claims of their argument – it could be a sign of desperation. This can be evidence for them not being able to defend their claim, but notagainst the claim itself.Variation: The bad reasons fallacy is similar, but the argument does not have tocontain a fallacy – it could just be a bad argument with bad evidence orreasons. Bad arguments do not automatically mean that the conclusion is false;there can be much better arguments and reasons that support the truth of theconclusion.> I have never seen God, therefore, he does not exist.This is a terrible reason to support a very strong conclusion.

Each small change can and often does lead to much more significant changes, asin the butterfly effect in chaos theory.Hearsay is generally considered very weak evidence, if considered evidence atall.

Notonly did Lolita not see Bill steal the money, but neither did Diane, Julian, andwho knows about Morris.Example #2:> There is life after death!

I swear to God it’s true!Explanation: The validity of the testimony of a coma patient aside, in alllikelihood, stories like these are either pure fabrications or exaggerations ofsome much less interesting story. Due to something called the confirmationbias and the wishful thinking fallacy[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_182.html#filepos729279], those whoalready believe in such phenomenon are likely to accept such stories as evidencefor their truthfulness, when in fact such stories are not evidence.

Bob’s silence does not mean he took the keys. Perhaps hedid, or perhaps he knows who did, or perhaps he saw a tyrannosaurus eat them, orperhaps he just felt like not answering.

If someone wants to beconvinced, this technique works like a charm. However, to the criticalthinker, this will not fly. Silence is not a valid substitute for reason orevidence.Exception: Generally speaking, absence of evidence is not evidence, however,there are many cases where the reason evidence is being held back can be seen asevidence.

Therefore, if a single day makes no difference, then a collection of> 1095 single days won’t make any difference, therefore, changing the drinking> age to 18 will not make any difference.Explanation: Although this does appear to be typical 18-year-old thinking (sorry18 year-olds), it is quite a common fallacy. Just because any single stepmakes no apparent difference, there is a difference that becomes more noticeableas the number of those steps increase.Example #2:> Willard: I just realized that I will probably never go bald!> Fanny: Why is that?> Willard: Well, if I lose just one hair, I will not be bald, correct?> Fanny: Of course.> Willard: If I lose two hairs?> Fanny: No.> Willard: Every time I lose a hair, the loss of that one hair will not make me> bald, therefore, I will never go bald.> Fanny: Congratulations, you found the cure to baldness – stupidity!Explanation: What Willard did not take into consideration is that “baldness” isa term used to define a state along a continuum, and although there is no clearpoint between bald and not bald, the extremes are both clearly recognizable andachievable.Exception: The larger the spread, the more fallacious the argument, the smallerthe spread, the less fallacious.Tip: Realize that there are very few clear lines we can draw between categoriesin any area of life.

(Assuming the car is worth $20k)Explanation: The price of $20k was a reasonable book value for the car, wherethe price of $1 was an unreasonable extreme. The fact is the car is worthabout $20k – thinking the car is worth $1 or $1,000,000, won’t change that fact6[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_187.html#filepos772811].Example #2:> Ok, I am willing to grant that there might not be angels and demons really> floating around Heaven or hanging out in Hell, but you must grant that there> has to be at least one God.

This usually stems from the irrational belief that statistics don’t apply in asituation, for one reason or another, when in fact they do.Example #1:> Only 6% of applicants make it into this school. But my son is brilliant! > They are certainly going to accept him!Explanation: Statistically speaking, there is a 6% chance they will accept him. The school is for brilliant kids, so the fact that her son is brilliant is anecessary condition to be part of the 6% who do make it.Example #2:> Faith healing works, but not all the time, especially when one’s faith is not> strong enough (as generally indicated by the size of one’s financial> offering). Unbiased, empirical tests, demonstrate that a small but> noticeable percentage of people are cured of “incurable” diseases such as> cancer.Explanation: This is true. But what is not mentioned in the above is thenumber of cases of cancer that just go away without any kind of faith healing,in other words, the base rate of cancer remission. It is a statisticalnecessity that among those with cancer, there will be a percentage withspontaneous remission.

The only way we could exist is if God created> us.Explanation: The claim, “God exists” has two supporting premises: 1) “we exist”,which everyone should agree to, and 2) “the only way we could exist is if Godcreated us”, which assumes the conclusion, “God exists”, therefore, begs thequestion.Exception: Some assumptions that are universally accepted could pass as notbeing fallacious.> People like to eat because we are biologically influenced to eat."},{"pageContent":"Biased Sample Fallacy(also known as: biased statistics, loaded sample, prejudiced statistics,prejudiced sample, loaded statistics, biased induction, biased generalization,unrepresentative sample, unrepresentative generalization)Description: Drawing a conclusion about a population based on a sample that isbiased, or chosen in order to make it appear the population on average isdifferent than it actually is.This differs from the hasty generalization fallacy[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_099.html#filepos437075], where thebiased sample is specifically chosen from a select group, and the small sampleis just a random sample, but too small to get any accurate information.Logical Form:> Sample S, which is biased, is taken from population P.> Conclusion C is drawn about population P based on S.Example #1:> Based on a survey of 1000 American homeowners, 99% of those surveyed have two> or more automobiles worth on average $100,000 each.

The authority could be parents, a coach, a boss, a military leader, ora divine authority.Logical Form:> Person 1 says Y is true.> Person 1 is seen as the ultimate authority.> Therefore, Y is true.Example #1:> During the Nazi war crimes trials at Nuremberg after World War II, Nazi war> criminals were charged with genocide, mass murder, torture and other> atrocities. Their defense: \"I was only following orders\".Explanation: Most of us begin our lives seeing our parents as the ultimateauthority, and we experience their wrath when we question that authority. Unfortunately, this bad habit is carried over into adulthood where we replaceour parents with a coach, a boss, a teacher, a commander, or a god. Ratherthan question, we blindly follow.

A broader application of thisfallacy is the general tendency to overlook opportunity costs, or that which isunseen, either in a financial sense or other.This fallacy goes far beyond just looking for the silver lining, thinkingpositive, or making the best of a bad situation. It is the incorrectassumption that the net benefit is positive.Logical Form:> Disaster X occurred, but this is a good thing because Y will come as a result.Example #1:> Dad, I actually did America a favor by crashing your car.

But not only did it not work, it is fallacious reasoning, andhere is why: by crashing the car, a produced good is destroyed and resourceshave to go into replacing that good as opposed to creating new goods.Example #2:> The holocaust was a good thing overall. It educated future generations about> the evils of genocide.Explanation: This is a real argument, I kid you not. People tend to overvaluetheir own gain (the education) and devalue the losses that are unseen (theunimaginable suffering of the victims and their families).

While my booksmay have played a role in some people leaving religion, I doubt is was the onlycause, and am pretty darn sure that overall, my books have very little effect onthe population at large.Exception: Causes and reasons can be debatable, so if you can adequately defendthe fact that you believe there was only a single reason, it won’t befallacious."},{"pageContent":"Cherry Picking(also known as: suppressed evidence, fallacy of incomplete evidence, argument byselective observation, argument by half-truth, card stacking, fallacy ofexclusion, ignoring the counter evidence, one-sided assessment, slanting,one-sidedness)Description: When only select evidence is presented in order to persuade theaudience to accept a position, and evidence that would go against the positionis withheld. The stronger the withheld evidence, the more fallacious theargument.Logical Form:> Evidence A and evidence B is available.> Evidence A supports the claim of person 1.> Evidence B supports the counter claim of person 2.> Therefore, person 1 presents only evidence A.Example #1:> Employer: It says here on your resume that you are a hard worker, you pay> attention to detail, and you don’t mind working long hours.> Andy: Yes sir.> Employer: I spoke to your previous employer.

Welcome to the Facebook team!Explanation: Resumes are a classic example of cherry picking information. Aresume can been seen as an argument to why you are qualified for the job. Mostemployers are wise enough to know that resumes are one-sided, and look for moreevidence in the form of interviews and recommendations to make a decision.Example #2:> You should be a Christian, because God is all about love and forgiveness, and> those are great things.Explanation: But the God of the Bible is also said to be many more things. Heis said to be a jealous God full of wrath, who hates all who do wrong (Psalm5:5). He is a god who will allow 80% of humanity to suffer eternally in Hell. According to the Bible, this is just God’s character – he is who he is.

This fallacy is often quitehumorous.Logical Form:> X is true because of Y.> Y is true because of X.Example #1:> Pvt. Joe Bowers: What are these electrolytes? Do you even know?> Secretary of State: They're... what they use to make Brawndo!> Pvt. Joe Bowers: But why do they use them to make Brawndo?> Secretary of Defense: [raises hand after a pause] Because Brawndo's got> electrolytes.Explanation: This example is from a favorite movie of mine, Idiocracy, wherePvt. Joe Bowers (played by Luke Wilson) is dealing with a bunch ofnot-very-smart guys from the future. Joe is not getting any useful informationabout electrolytes, no matter how hard he tries.Example #2:> The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible.Explanation: This is a very serious circular argument on which many people basedtheir entire lives. This is like getting an e-mail from a Nigerian prince,offering to give you his billion dollar fortune – but only after you wire him a“good will” offering of $50,000. Of course you are skeptical, until you readthe final line in the e-mail that reads, “I, prince Nubadola, assure you thatthis is my message and it is legitimate. You can trust this e-mail and anyothers that come from me.” Now you know it is legitimate, because it says soin the e-mail.Exception: Some philosophies state that we can never escape circular reasoning,because the arguments always come back to axioms or first principles. But inthose cases, the circles are very large and do manage to share usefulinformation in determining the truth of the proposition.Tip: Do your best to avoid circular arguments, as it will help you reasonbetter, because better reasoning is often a result of avoiding circulararguments.Variation: A circular definition is a defining a term by using the term in thedefinition. Ironically, that definition is partly guilty, by my use of theterm “definition” in the definition. Ok, I am using definition way too much.Damn!

But assuming that premise is true, does not guarantee that theconclusion, is true. There are many smart people without PhDs.Example #2:> If I have herpes, then I have a strange rash.> Therefore, if I have a strange rash, then I have herpes.Explanation: I am glad this is not true.

It is a form of misleading discourse, and it is a fallacy when theaudience does not detect the assumed information implicit in the question, andaccepts it as a fact.Example #1:> How many times per day do you beat your wife?Explanation: Even if the response is an emphatic, “none!”, the damage has beendone. If you are hearing this question, you are more likely to accept thepossibility that the person who was asked this question is a wife-beater, whichis fallacious reasoning on your part.Example #2:> If God did not create the universe, who did?Explanation: The presupposition is that the universe was “created”. Somenervous debate neophyte might blurt out, “I don’t know who did, but it wasn’tGod!”, falling right into the trap.Exception: It is not a fallacy if the implied information in the question isknown to be an accepted fact.> How long can one survive without water?Here it is presumed that we need water to survive, which very few would denythat fact."},{"pageContent":"Conflicting Conditionscontradictio in adjecto(also known as: a self-contradiction)Description: When the argument is self-contradictory and cannot possibly betrue.Example #1:> The only thing that is certain is uncertainty.Explanation: Uncertainty itself cannot be certain by definition. It is aself-contradiction.Example #2:> I don’t care what you believe, as long as your beliefs don’t harm others.Explanation: This is a contradiction. At first glance, “as long as” appears tobe a condition for the assertion, “I don’t care what you believe”, but it’s not;the assertion has to be false in all cases. The arguer must always care if theperson believes something that will harm others or not.Exception: When the self-contradictory statement is not put fourth as anargument, but rather as an ironic statement, perhaps with the intent to conveysome kind of deeper truth or meaning, but not to necessarily be taken literally,then this fallacy is not committed."},{"pageContent":"Confusing an Explanation with an ExcuseDescription: Treating an explanation of a fact as if it were a justification ofthe fact, a valid reason for the fact, or evidence for the fact.Logical Form:> X is asked to be justified.> X is explained in detail.> Therefore, X is justified.Example #1:> Mrs. Crabtree: Your child, Mrs. Martin, is rude to me and shows me no respect.> Mrs. Martin: That’s because he thinks you are a “poo-poo faced bag lady who> hates little kids”.> Mrs. Crabtree: That is no excuse for his behavior!> Mrs. Martin: No, it’s just a fact.Explanation: In this case, Mrs. Crabtree committed the fallacy by incorrectlythinking Mrs. Martin’s fact was meant to be a justification, when it was not.Example #2:> Virgil: How could God sacrifice himself to himself?> Marshall: God came to earth in the flesh and died on the cross for our sins,> therefore, being the perfect sacrifice.Explanation: Marshall simply explained the fact of what God did, he did not givea valid reason for the fact.Exception: If it is clear to both parties that no justification attempt is beingmade, but rather just stating a fact, then this fallacy is not being committed.Tip: If you are unsure if someone is trying to make an excuse or simply statinga fact, ask them.

This fallacy usually stems from thinking the choices arealternatives, rather than members of the same set. The fallacy is furtherexacerbated by priming the audience with information leading them to choose thesubset as the more probable option.Logical Form:> X is a subset of Y.> Therefore, Y is more probable than X.Example #1:> While jogging around the neighborhood, you are more likely to get bitten by> someone’s pet dog, than by any member of the canine species.Explanation: Actually, that is not the case. “Someone’s pet dog”, assuming areal dog and not some robot dog, would also be a member of the canine species. Therefore, the canine species includes wolves, coyotes, as well as yourneighbor’s shih tzu, who is likely to bite you just because he’s pissed forbeing so small.Example #2:> Christianity is far more probable than just “some intelligent force in the> universe”.Explanation: Actually, that is not the case. “Some intelligent force in theuniverse”, leaves it open for any God or no god, one god or multiple gods, godsthat are beings, gods that are nature, with any name, and any property – or justthe property of intelligence and capablility of acting (force). Christianitymakes a very specific claim about the one and only God, with many properties andcharacteristics, whose name is YAWEH, and does not want us to eat shellfish. Regardless of how much evidence there is for Christianity, it is far lessprobable than the probability that there is some intelligent force in theuniverse, since the Christian God is, “some intelligent force in the universe”plus many more properties. With each property identified, the probability isreduced.Exception: When contradicting conditions are implied, but incorrectly stated.> Mr. Pipp, is a sharp dresser, walks like a woman, talks in a very high voice,> says “fabulous” way too much, and loves everything Barbara Streisand. Is Mr.> Pipp more likely to be a man or a gay man?The way the question reads, there is a 100% chance Mr. Pipp is a man, andsmaller chance that his is a gay man, because the group “man” includes all themembers of the group “gay man”. However, if the questioner meant to imply,“straight man” or “gay man” as the choices, then it could be more of a poorlyphrased question than a fallacy."},{"pageContent":"Conspiracy Theory(also known as: canceling hypothesis, cover-ups)Description: Explaining that your claim cannot be proven or verified because thetruth is being hidden, and evidence destroyed. When that reason is challengedas not being true or accurate, the challenge is often presented as just anotherattempt to cover up the truth, and presented as further evidence that theoriginal claim is true.Logical Form:> A is true.> B is why the truth cannot be proven.> Therefore, A is true.Example #1:> Noah’s ark has been found by the Russian government a long time ago. But> because of their hate for religion, they have been covering it up ever since.Example #2:> Geologists and scientists all over the world are discovering strong evidence> for a 6000 year-old earth, yet because of the threat of ruining their> reputation, they are suppressing the evidence and keeping quiet.Explanation: The psychology behind conspiracy theories is quite complex andinvolves many different cognitive biases and fallacies discussed in this book. In general, people tend to overlook the incredible improbabilities involved ina large-scale conspiracy, as well as the potential risks for all involved in thealleged cover up. In the above examples, those who stick with a literalinterpretation of the Bible often experience cognitive dissidence, or the mentalstruggle involved when one’s beliefs contradict factual claims. This cognitivedissidence causes people to create conspiracy theories, like the ones above, tochange facts to match their beliefs, rather than changing their beliefs to matchfacts.Exception: Sometimes, there really are conspiracies and cover ups. The moreevidence one can present for a cover-up, the better. But we must rememberthat possibility does not equal probability.Tip: Take time to question any conspiracy theories in which you believe aretrue.

Both arguers are taking the opportunity to define a term as a way totake a cheap shot at the opponent. In some cases, they might actually hopetheir definition is accepted, which would make it very easy to defend, comparedto the actual definition.Exception: When a definition used is really an accurate definition from crediblesources, regardless of the damage it might do to a position.Tip: Do not accept definitions put fourth by the opponent unless you researchedyour definition on your own, and agree."},{"pageContent":"Denying the Antecedent(also known as: inverse error, inverse fallacy)Description: It is a fallacy in formal logic where in a standard if/thenpremise, the antecedent (what comes after the “if”) is made not true, then it isconcluded that the consequent (what comes after the “then”) is not true.Logical Form:> If P, then Q.> Not P.> Therefore, not Q.Example #1:> If it barks, it is a dog.> It doesn’t bark.> Therefore, it’s not a dog.Explanation: It is not that clear that a fallacy is being committed, but becausethis is a formal argument following a strict form, even if the conclusion seemsto be true, the argument is still invalid. This is why fallacies can be verytricky and deceptive. Since it doesn’t bark, we cannot conclude with certaintythat it isn’t a dog – it could be a dog who just can’t bark.The arguer has committed a formal fallacy and the argument is invalid, becausethe truth of the premises do not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.Example #2:> If I have cable, then I have seen a naked lady.> I don’t have cable.> Therefore, I have never seen a naked lady.Explanation: The fallacy is more obvious here than in the first example. Denyingthe antecedent (saying that I don’t have cable) does not mean we must deny theconsequent (that I have seen a naked lady).The arguer has committed a formal fallacy and the argument is invalid, becausethe truth of the premises do not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.Exception: None.Tip: If you ever get confused with formal logic, replace the words with letters,like we do in the logical form, then replace the letters with different phrasesand see if it makes sense or not."},{"pageContent":"Denying a ConjunctDescription: A formal fallacy in which the first premise states that at leastone of the two conjuncts (antecedent and consequent) is false, and concludesthat the other conjunct must be true.Logical Form:> Not both P and Q.> Not P.> Therefore, Q.> > Not both P and Q.> Not Q.> Therefore, P.Example #1:> I am not both a moron and an idiot.> I am not a moron.> Therefore, I am an idiot.Explanation: I might be an idiot, but the truth of both premises do notguarantee that I am, therefore, this argument is invalid – the form of thisformal argument is invalid. Being “not both” a moron and an idiot, only meansthat if I am not one of the two, I am simply not one of the two – we cannotlogically conclude that I am the other.Example #2:> I am not both a Christian and a Satanist.> I am not a Satanist.> Therefore, I am a Christian.Explanation: The truth of both premises do not guarantee that I am a Christian,therefore, this argument is invalid – the form of this formal argument isinvalid.

If Paulie were smarter, he couldhave not committed the fallacy and saved his kneecaps, by honesty and a littlenegotiation:> Rocco: Do ya have the five grand you owe me or not?> Paulie: No. I realize I did not hold up my end of the deal, so I will> compensate you for that.> Rocco: What are you sayin’?> Paulie: I can have your $5000 by this time tomorrow, plus an extra $500 for> making you have to wait an extra day.> Rocco: Deal.

There is absolutely no difference herebecause the only possible way to read the Bible is through interpretation, inother words, what we think it says.

The conclusion in example #1 makes sense, but it does notfollow logically – it is an invalid argument. Based on the first two premises,there is no way to logically deduce that conclusion. Now look at examples #2and #3. We use the same logical form of the argument, committing the samefallacy, but by changing the terms it is much more clear that something wentwrong somewhere, and it did. This kind of argument, the categorical syllogism,cannot have two negative premises and still be valid.Just because the conclusion appears true, it does not mean the argument is valid(or strong, in the case of an informal argument).Exception: None.Tip: Learn to recognize the forms of formal fallacies, and you will easily spotinvalid formal arguments."},{"pageContent":"Existential Fallacy(also known as: existential instantiation)Description: A formal logical fallacy which is committed when a categoricalsyllogism employs two universal premises (“all”) to arrive at a particular(“some”) conclusion.In a valid categorical syllogism, if the two premises are universal, then theconclusion must be universal as well.The reasoning behind this fallacy becomes clear when you use classes without anymembers, and the conclusion states that there are members to this class – whichis wrong.Logical Form:> All X are Y.> All Z are X.> Therefore, some Z are Y.Example #1:> All babysitters have pimples.> All babysitter club members are babysitters.> Therefore, some babysitter club members have pimples.Example #2:> All forest creatures live in the woods.> All leprechauns are forest creatures.> Therefore, some leprechauns live in the woods.Explanation: In both examples, the fallacy is committed because we have twouniversal premises and a particular conclusion. But our example #1 conclusionmakes sense, no? Just because the conclusion might be true, does not mean thelogic used to produce it, was valid. This is how tests like SAT’s and GRE’sscrew us over. And technically, in the above example, all babysitter clubmembers have pimples, not just some.Now look that the second example. Same form, but when we use classes thatobviously (to most people) have no members (leprechauns), we can see that itresults in a conclusion that is false.

Thinking the atom was the smallest particle was a mistake of science.> P2. Evolution is also a mistake in science.> P3. Therefore, science thinking the atom was the smallest particle is like> science thinking evolution is true.Premise two (P2) should jump out as a bold assumption, although not fallacious. Remember, the premises don’t have to be true for the argument to be valid. But if both premises were true, does the conclusion (p3) follow? No, becauseof the extended fallacy. The reason is, if evolution were false, it would notbe for the same reason that science thought the atom was the smallest particle. Science “was wrong” in that case because it did not have the whole truth due todiscoveries yet to be made at the time. If evolution were wrong, then all thediscoveries that have been made, the facts that have been established, thefoundation of many sciences that have led to countless advances in medicine,would all be dead wrong.

The above example is an illustration of this. We can redefine,“spirit” as many times as we like, but our understanding of what a spiritactually is will still be lacking.Assuming we did not really understand what was meant by “spirit”, thedefinition, “non-corporeal substance” might or might not shed any light on whatis meant by the term. In this case, it might be more clear now that Linda isnot referring to alcoholic beverages, but conceptually, what is a non-physicalsubstance? Especially when “substance” is defined as being physical matter ormaterial.We fallaciously reason that we now understand what the term represents when infact we don’t.Exception: Some may actually just lack the vocabulary needed – this is not yourfault, but you should do your best to attempt to elucidate using wordsunderstandable to your audience.Tip: Are there any concepts that you feel you understand, when really you canjust define the concept with words?"},{"pageContent":"Fake Precision(also known as: over-precision, false precision, misplaced precision, spuriousaccuracy)Description: Using implausibly precise statistics to give the appearance oftruth and certainty, or using negligible difference in data to draw incorrectinferences.Example #1:> Tour Guide: This fossil right here is 120,000,003 years old.> Guest: How do you know that?> Tour Guide: Because when I started working here three years ago, the experts> did some radiometric dating and told me that it was 120,000,000 years old.Explanation: Although more of a comedy skit than anything else, thisdemonstrates the fallacious reasoning by the tour guide in her assumption thatthe dates given to her were precise to the year.Example #2: The difference between first and second in many cases is negligible,statistically, yet we give those differences artificial meaning.

Molecules do not have consciousness. > Therefore, your brain cannot be the source of consciousness.Explanation: I included three examples that demonstrate this fallacy from thevery obvious to the less obvious, but equally as flawed. In the first example,it is obvious because weight is cumulative. In the second example, we knowthat water is wet, but we only experience the property of wetness when themolecules are combined, and in large scale. This introduces the concept ofemergent properties, which when ignored, tend to promote magical thinking[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_122.html#filepos524530]. The finalexample is a common argument made for a supernatural explanation forconsciousness. On the surface, it is difficult to imagine a collection ofmolecules resulting in something like consciousness, because we are focusing onthe properties of the parts (molecules) and not the whole system, whichincorporates emergence, motion, the use of energy, temperature (vibration),order, and other relational properties.Exception: If the whole is very close to the similarity of the parts, then moreassumptions can be made from the parts to the whole. For example, if we open asmall bag of potato chips and discover that the first one is delicious, it isnot fallacious to conclude that whole snack (all the chips, minus the bag) willbe equally as delicious. But, we cannot say the same for one of those Costcofamily size bags, because most of us would be hurling after about 10 minutes ofour chip-eating frenzy."},{"pageContent":"Fallacy of Division(also known as: false division, division fallacy, ecological fallacy [form of],ecological inference fallacy [form of])Description: Inferring that something is true of one or more of the parts fromthe fact that it is true of the whole.

The size of thewhole (the house) is not directly related to the size of every part of thehouse.Example #2:> I heard that bishop in the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal> cover-up. The entire Catholic Church is corrupt!Explanation: Just because a member of the Church is corrupt, does not mean thatthe whole Church is corrupt.Exception: When a part of the whole has a property that, by definition, causesthe whole to take on that property.> I heard that bishop in the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal> cover-up.

The equivocation fallacy[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_078.html#filepos360692] can also fitthis fallacy, because the same term is used in two different ways, making fourdistinct terms, although only appearing to be three.Logical Form: There are many possible forms, this is one example:> All X are Y.> All A are B.> Therefore, all X are B.Example #1:> All cats are felines.> All dogs are canines.> Therefore, all cats are canines.Explanation: When you add in a fourth term to a categorical syllogism that canonly have three terms to be logically valid, we get nonsense – or at least aninvalid argument. Example #2:> All Greek gods are mythical.> All modern day gods are real.> Therefore, all Greek gods are real.Explanation: Again, nonsense.

Fran is amother – so far so good. But the conclusion is not true – Fran does not haveto have children simply because she does not have to be a mother. To escapethis fallacy, we could change our second premise to, “Fran is necessarily amother” (whatever that may mean).Example #2:> Synchronized swimming fans necessarily love synchronized swimming.> Momo is a synchronized swimming fan.> Therefore, Momo necessarily loves synchronized swimming.Explanation: We have the same exact form as example #1, but with differentcontent.

But, the argument is invalid, and by pluggingin new terms, like in the next example, we can see why.Example #2:> All ghosts are imaginary.> All unicorns are imaginary.> Therefore, all ghosts are unicorns.Explanation: While there may be ghosts that are unicorns, it does not followfrom the premises: the only thing the premises tell us about ghosts and unicornsis that they are both imaginary – we have no information how they are related toeach other.Exception: None."},{"pageContent":"False Attribution(also known as: argument from false authority [form of])Description: Appealing to an irrelevant, unqualified, unidentified, biased orfabricated source in support of an argument.Logical Form:> Claim X is made.> Source Y, a fake or unverifiable source, is use to verify claim X.> Therefore, claim X is true.Example #1:> But professor, I got all these facts from a program I saw on TV once...

While it might be thecase that the person telling this story really does remember reading aconvincing argument, it very well could be the case that this person isfabricating this book – it sure sounds like it.

So by myauthority, any outright lies are lies, not fallacies. Other authorities maydisagree.Tip: Never falsify facts.

False dilemmas are usuallycharacterized by “either this or that” language, but can also be characterizedby omissions of choices. Another variety is the false trilemma, which is whenthree choices are presented when more exist.Logical Form:> Either X or Y is true.> > Either X, Y or Z is true.Example (two choices):> You are either with God, or against him.Explanation: As Obi Wan Kenobi so eloquently puts it is Star Wars episode III,“Only a Sith deals in absolutes!” There are also those who simply don’tbelieve there is a God to either be for or against.Example (omission):> I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t at church today.Explanation: The assumption here is that bad people don’t go to church. Ofcourse, good people exist who don’t go to church, and good church-going peoplecould have had a really good reason not to be in church – like a hangover fromthe swingers gathering the night before.Example (trilemma):> Don’t give me that, “Jesus was just a good teacher” crap.

Forthe most part, the threat that you will “ruin” your eyesight is an old wivestail, but it does have some credibility based on modern studies. But almostcertainly, nobody is going blind from sitting too close unless they ram theireyes into the protruding knobs. Anyway, the conclusion, “so move back!” is notwarranted by the false effect.Example #2:> Giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo> into Heaven, so give your money!Explanation: Centuries ago, the Church stopped accepting bribes to get lovedones out of Limbo, and very recently, in 2007, the Church made it more clearthat Limbo was a theory and not an official doctrine of the Church, separatingthe Church from that belief. As for the argument, the false effect of “freeinga child’s soul from Limbo” does not warrant the conclusion of giving your money.Exception: A belief of an effect, could be argued to be an actual effect.

Even when it does, the“wrongs” are blamed on human interpretation. Science is all about improvingideas to get closer to the truth, and, in some cases, completely throwing outtheories that have been proven wrong.

The chance for each flip is 50/50, no matter how many times headscame up before.Example #2:> Eric: For my lottery numbers, I chose 6, 14, 22, 35, 38, 40. What did you> choose?> Steve: I chose 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.> Eric: You idiot! Those numbers will never come up!Explanation: “Common sense” is contrary to logic and probability, when peoplethink that any possible lottery number is more probable than any other. Thisis because we see meaning in patterns – but probability doesn’t. Because ofwhat is called the clustering illusion, we give the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6special meaning when arranged in that order, random chance is just as likely toproduce a 1 as the first number, as it is a 6. Now the second number producedis only affected by the first selection in that the first number is no longer apossible choice, but still, the number 2 has the exact same odds as beingselected as 14, and so on.Example #3:> Maury: Please put all my chips on red 21.> Dealer: Are you sure you want to do that? Red 21 just came up in the last> spin.> Maury: I didn’t know that! Thank you! Put it on black 15 instead. I> can’t believe I almost made that mistake!Explanation: The dealer (or whatever you call the person spinning the roulettewheel) really should know better – the fact that red 21 just came up iscompletely irrelevant to the chances that it will come up again for the nextspin. If it did, to us, that would seem “weird” but it is simply theinevitable result of probability.Exception: If you think something is random, but it really isn’t – like a loadeddie, then previous outcomes can be used as an indicator of future outcomes.Tip: Gamble for the fun, not for the money, and don’t wager more than youwouldn’t mind losing. Remember, at least as far as casinos go, the odds areagainst you.Variation: The hot hand fallacy is the irrational belief that if you win or loseseveral chance games in a row you are either “hot” or “cold”, respectively.

While my upbringing was Catholic,and I have long since considered myself a Catholic, that is irrelevant to anydefenses I make of Catholicism – like the fact that many local churches do focuson helping the community through charity work. If I make an argument defendinganything Catholic, the argument should be evaluated on the argument itself, noton the history of the one making the argument or how I came to hold the claimsas true or false.Exception: At times, the origin of the claim is relevant to the truth of theclaim. > I believe in closet monsters because my big sister told me unless I do> whatever she tells me, the closet monsters will eat me."},{"pageContent":"God Wildcard Fallacy*(also known as: divine mystery fallacy)Description: Excuses a contradiction in logic or reason by, “divine mystery.” This is a form of the missing data fallacy[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_125.html#filepos532879], but where themissing information is always a divine mystery of some form. The God wildcardcomes in many forms, and is played when honest questioning leads to absurd orillogical conclusions. Rather than revise sacred theological ideas, those whoplay the God wildcard, believe they are acting in humility and simply claiminghonest ignorance – but they are not. Honest ignorance and a display of humilitywould be admitting that you might be wrong in your hypothesis and/or conclusion,not just missing a supporting fact.Logical Form:> Claim X is being made.> Claim X is shown to be contradictory, absurd, or unsupported.> Claim X is a divine mystery.> Therefore, claim X is true.Example #1:> Rene: If God is eternal, why did God all of a sudden decide to create the> universe? Was he bored?> Luke: That is a divine mystery, but it happened.Explanation: Questions about faith often require faith-based answers, notreason-based ones. But unlike reason-based answers, faith-based answers can begiven for any question – and can never be proven wrong. It has been said, thatwhich answers everything, answers nothing.Example #2:> Jill: Why did God put the forbidden fruit tree right smack in the middle of> the Garden of Eden if he did not want Adam or Eve to eat from it?> Luke: I am sure God had his reasons. Who are you to question God?Explanation: Instead of insisting that \"God had his reasons\", perhaps Luke andJill should revisit the validity of the question itself, starting with theliteral truth of Genesis and eventually getting to the literal existence of God.Exception: Very often we all pull out the God wildcard as a figure of speech,rather than an explanation or a conclusion to an argument.

Therefore, smoking really can’t be that bad for you.Explanation: It is extremely unreasonable (and dangerous) to draw a universalconclusion about the health risks of smoking by the case study of one man.Example #2:> Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand. > Therefore, it must be great.Explanation: It turns out, that only five dentists were actually asked. When arandom sampling of 1000 dentists were polled, only 20% actually recommended thebrand. The four out of five result was not necessarily a biased sample[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_060.html#filepos299850] or a dishonestsurvey, it just happened to be a statistical anomaly common among small samples.Exception: A statistics of a larger population are not available, and decisionmust be made or opinion formed, if the small sample size is all you have to workwith, then it is better than nothing.

Of course, had we known about the accident, the main road would havebeen the better choice. But nobody could have reasonably predicted thataccident. It is fallacious, and somewhat pointless, to suggest that we “shouldhave” taken the other way.Example #2:> Judas was an idiot to turn Jesus in to the authorities. After all, he ended> up committing suicide out of guilt.Explanation: It is easy for us to blame Judas as people who know the whole storyand how it played out.

I have faith that I can.Explanation: Many people consider “faith” the most reliable form ofepistemology, that is, logic, reason and science are a distant second whenconflicts arise. But why rely on faith? In the example above, Ralphieexplains how it is through, “faith in faith” that he trusts his faith in God. From this, we can extrapolate that he has faith in the faith that is used forthe faith in God, and so on to an infinite regress.To escape this regress, some have suggested that through the reasoningfaculties, they trust faith – but then the foundation of faith is reason, and ofcourse, the foundation of reason is God (faith).Exception: None"},{"pageContent":"Hypnotic Bait and SwitchDescription: Stating several uncontroversially true statements in succession,followed by a claim that the arguer wants the audience to accept as true.

Your subconscious mind starts to take over and it seemsalmost reactionary that you start chanting “yes” or “no” (as in the secondexample) while not really considering to what you are agreeing or disagreeing. These kind of techniques work best in rallies where those doing the rallyingcount on you to act with emotion at the expense of your reason.Exception: It’s an effective persuasion technique, so if trying to convince yourkids to stay off drugs, then manipulate away. But if you are trying to getsomeone to buy a vacuum cleaner, then take your hypnotic bait and switch andshove it up your reusable, hypoallergenic, dust bag.Tip: Become a human fallacy detector. Look for these kind of techniqueseverywhere you go. As a result, your reasonable self will become conditionedto resist taking a back seat to emotional propaganda."},{"pageContent":"Hypothesis Contrary to Fact(also known as: counterfactual fallacy, speculative fallacy, \"what if\" fallacy,wouldchuck)Description: Offering a poorly supported claim about what might have happened inthe past or future, if (the hypothetical part) circumstances or conditions weredifferent. The fallacy also entails treating future hypothetical situations asif they are fact.Logical Form:> If event X did happen, then event Y would have happened.

This fallacy appearsto support both sides of an issue – a tactic common in politics.Example #1: This example is actually the origin of the fallacy, which refers toa 1952 speech by Noah S. “Soggy” Sweat, Jr., a young lawmaker from the U.S.state of Mississippi, on the subject of whether Mississippi should continue toprohibit (which it did until 1966) or finally legalize alcoholic beverages.

I will not retreat from it. I will not compromise.Explanation: This is an amazing insight to the human mind and the area ofrhetoric. We can see how when both sides of the issue are presented throughthe same use of emotionally charged words and phrases, the argument is reallyvacuous and presents very little factual information, nor does it even take astance on the issue.Example #2: Having evaluated literally thousands of positions on God by peopleall over the belief spectrum, I thought I would create my own, “If-by-God”version of the argument, showing how carefully placed rhetoric can blur the linebetween the most perfect being imaginable and the most horrible beingimaginable.> The question is, if God does exist, should we love him and worship him?

The examples below make this more clear. This is a fallacy only fortype “E” and type “I” forms, or forms using the words “no” and “some”,respectively.Logical Form:> No S are P.> Therefore, no non-P are non-S.> > Some S are P.> Therefore, some non-P are non-S.Example #1:> No Catholics are Jews.> Therefore, no non-Jews are non-Catholics. (contraposition)Explanation: By definition, no Catholics are Jews (using type “E” form here) –clear enough. Now let’s take the contraposition of that proposition byswitching the placement of “Catholics” and “Jews”, and negating each, and we cansee we have a false proposition. “No non-Jews are non-Catholics” clearly doesnot mean the same thing as “No Catholics are Jews”. In this example, thepremise is true but the conclusion is false (I am a non-Jew and a non-Catholic,and statistically speaking, you probably are too.)Example #2:> Some dogs bark.> Therefore, some non-barking things are non-dogs. (contraposition)Explanation: We now see the type “I” form in action, stating, “Some” dogs bark. This is true, but that really does not matter in determining what form of anargument is valid or not. The conclusion, “some non-barking things arenon-dogs” is also a true statement (my toothbrush, which is a non-dog, does notbark), but this does not matter either. What does matter, is that it does notlogically follow. Don’t be misled by truth! Focus on the form of theargument. If we substitute other terms we can see the fallacy more clearly:> Some humans are mortal.> Therefore, some immortals are non-human. (contraposition)By using the word, “some”, we are not asserting that there are definitely somethat are not. Above, just by saying that some humans are mortal, weautomatically are saying that there are others who are not mortal. Therefore,our conclusion is supposing a group that does not exist, thus fallacious.Exception: None, but remember that the following type “A” and type “O” forms arevalid:> All P are Q.> Therefore, all non-Q are non-P.> > Some P are not Q.> Therefore, some non-Q are not non-P.Quick explanation, using the type “A” form, let’s say that all humans aremortals. The contraposition: all immortals are non-human. Not only does thismake sense in terms of truth, but it follows necessarily from the premise,therefore, it is valid (and not a fallacy).Tip: Don’t give up on formal fallacies! Once you get it, it actually will helpyou in everyday reasoning."},{"pageContent":"Illicit Major(also known as: illicit process of the major term)Description: Any form of a categorical syllogism in which the major term isdistributed in the conclusion, but not in the major premise.Logical Form:> All A are B> No C are A> Therefore, no C are BExample #1:> All hotdogs are fast food.> No hamburgers are hotdogs.> Therefore, no hamburgers are fast food.Explanation: In our example, the major term is “fast food”, because it is theterm that appears in the major premise (first premise) as the predicate, and inthe conclusion. As such, in this position, it is “undistributed”.Example #2:> All Jim Carry movies are hilarious.> No horror movies are Jim Carry movies.> Therefore, no horror movies are hilarious.Explanation: In our example, the major term is “hilarious”, because it is theterm that appears in the major premise (first premise) as the predicate, and inthe conclusion.

As such, in this position, it is “undistributed”.Example #2:> All Paul Newman movies are great.> All great movies are Oscar winners.> Therefore, all Oscar winners are Paul Newman movies.Explanation: In our example, the minor term is “Oscar winners”, because it isthe term that appears in the minor premise (second premise) as the predicate,and in the conclusion. As such, in this position, it is “undistributed”.Exception: None."},{"pageContent":"Illicit Substitution of Identicals(also known as: hooded man fallacy, masked man fallacy, intensional fallacy)Description: A formal fallacy due to confusing the knowing of a thing(extension) with the knowing of it under all its various names or descriptions(intension).We need to define two terms here to fully understand this fallacy: intensionaland extensional. In logic and mathematics, an intensional definition gives themeaning of a term by specifying all the properties required to come to thatdefinition, that is, the necessary and sufficient conditions for belonging tothe set being defined. In contrast, an extensional definition, is defined byits listing everything that falls under that definition. Confused? Youshould be, but relax because I am not done.Imagine Superman, who is also Clark Kent, flew to Italy for a slice of pizza. If we said, “Clark Kent flew to Italy for pizza” we would be right, because ofthe extensional context of that statement. Conversely, if we said, “Lois Lanethinks Superman flew to Italy for pizza”, we would still be making a true claim,although the context is now intensional, as indicated by the term, “thinks”. Now if we said, “Lois Lane thinks Clark Kent flew to Italy for pizza”, we wouldbe wrong and would have committed this fallacy, because Lois does not believethat, even though extensionally it is the case (this is after the kiss thatwiped her memory of Clark being Superman).Example #1:> The lady in the pink dress is Julia Roberts.> The reporter thinks the lady in the pink dress drives a Prius.> Therefore, the reporter thinks Julia Roberts drives a Prius.Example #2:> The reporter thinks the lady in the pink dress drives a Prius.> The reporter doesn’t think Julia Roberts drives a Prius.> Therefore, Julia Roberts does not drive a Prius.Explanation: The examples used are just two different logical forms of the samefallacy. Because the reporter, “thinks” the statement is made in a intensionalcontext, we cannot switch the terms. However, if we were to keep the premisesin an extensional context, we could get away with switching the terms. Thiswould be a valid logical argument form known as Leibniz’ Law.Exception: Technically, none, but here is the above example #1 using Leibniz’Law, with no fallacy:> The lady in the pink dress is Julia Roberts.> The lady in the pink dress drives a Prius.> Therefore, Julia Roberts drives a Prius."},{"pageContent":"Inconsistency(also known as: kettle logic [form of], internal contradiction [form of],logical inconsistency [form of])Description: In terms of a fallacious argument, one or more propositions areasserted that cannot both possibly be true.

In fact, creation scientists can prove that Noah’s> flood really happened.Explanation: The creationist dismisses the foundation of science, then in thenext breath, support “creation science” based on “scientific evidence”. Denying science and accepting it by choosing certain theories in which tobelieve, is inconsistent. And I am quite sure the creationist who deniesscience will write about how they reject science on their computer, that is theresult of science.Example #2:> God is pure love as well as the creator of everything.Explanation: There are two assertions: 1) God is pure love and 2) he is thecreator of everything. As the creator of everything, he must have createdhate, or at least the mechanism which results in hate. Believing that hate canpossibly come from pure love, is inconsistent.> The arrogant cannot stand in your presence; you hate all who do wrong. (Psalm> 5:5)Exception: One needs to be able to explain how the beliefs are not inconsistent.Tip: Think about your beliefs. Are there any inconsistent with each other? With how you act and what you do?Variation: The internal contradiction is a blatant contradiction in the sameargument (thus “internal”).> I never had sexual relations with that woman – but it sure was nice!Kettle logic is usually multiple, contradicting arguments, supporting a singlepoint. In an example used by Sigmund Freud in The Interpretation of Dreams, aman accused by his neighbor of having returned a kettle in a damaged conditionoffered three arguments:> That he had returned the kettle undamaged;> That it was already damaged when he borrowed it;> That he had never borrowed it in the first place.A logical inconsistency usually refers specifically to inconsistencies informal, or deductive, logic.> Ted is older than Sam.

This is a form of black and white thinking –either we know the exact truth, or we know nothing at all. Logical Form:> Authority A disagrees with Authority B on issue X.> Therefore, we can say nothing meaningful about issue X.Example #1:> My mom says that I should study for at least 2 hours each night, and my dad> says just a half hour should be fine. Neither one of them know what they are> talking about, so I should just skip studying all together.Explanation: A disagreement among experts does not mean that both are wrong, theanswer is a compromise, or that there is no answer to be know; it simply meansthat there is disagreement – that is all we can infer.Example #2:> Scientists cannot agree on the age of the universe.

It should be clear that because there> is so much disagreement, then the 6000 year old universe should be carefully> considered as well.Explanation: Scientists who “disagree” with the estimated age of the universe,do so primarily on slightly different interpretations of the same objectivelyvalid dating methods. The difference is fairly minute in terms of percentage. Suggesting 6000 years is valid is one thing, but doing so based on thedifference in interpretation from mainstream science, is completely fallacious. The differences have no bearing on the truth claim of the argument (the actualage).Exception: When the difference in professional disagreement is critical, itshould be carefully examined.

In short, reasoning was abandoned.Example #2:> It’s getting late and we still have to decide on the school budget. What do> you say we just leave it as is and we can call it a night.Explanation: It is not reasonable to assume the conclusion that the budgetshould be left where it is based on the desire to go home.Exception: There are many times when quick decisions are required, and evidencecannot be fully examined, and in such circumstances we need to come to the bestconclusion we can with the resources we have.Tip: If anyone gives you an unreasonable time frame for making a decision, it isalmost always an attempt to discourage you from critical thought.

This is usuallyindicated by the phrases, “just trust me”, “because I said so”, “you’ll see”, or“just because”. The just because fallacy is not conducive to the goal ofargumentation – that is coming to a mutually agreeable solution. Nor is ithelpful in helping the other person understand why you are firm on yourposition. “Just because” is not a reason that speaks to the question itself; itis simply a deflection to authority (legitimate or not).Logical Form:> X is true because I said so.Example #1:> Trebor: Mom, can David sleepover tonight?> Mom: No.> Trebor: Why not?> Mom: Because.> Trebor: Because why?> Mom: Because I said so! End of discussion!Explanation: “Because I said so”, is not a valid reason for why a friend can’tsleep over. Maybe the real reason is that sleepovers give mom a headache. Maybe mom wants Trebor to go to bed early because he is cranky the next day ifhe doesn’t. Or perhaps David is just a little brat that drives mom crazy.Example #2:> Slick Rick: The best I can do for ya is $25,000.> Prospect: Why can’t you do any better?> Slick Rick: Just because that is the lowest I can go.> Prospect: But why.> Slick Rick: Because.Explanation: In this case, it is clear that there is some underlying reason thatSlick Rick does not want the prospect to know about. This reason, almostcertainly, has something to do with the fact that Slick Rick can go lower ifneeded.Exception: There is really no exception to this rule in argumentation or seriousdiscussion. Perhaps this is acceptable in situations where you have theauthority to choose not to make an argument out of a command, like in aparent-child relationship. Or perhaps your significant other has planned asurprise for you, and the “you’ll see” is meant to deflect your inquiry for yourown benefit.Tip: Don’t let yourself off the hook with “just because” excuses. Keep askingyourself, “what is the real reason?” The answer could uncover an issue thatneeds your attention."},{"pageContent":"Just In Case Fallacy(also known as: worst case scenario fallacy)Description: Making an argument based on the worst-case scenario rather than themost probable scenario, allowing fear to prevail over reason.Logical Form:> It would be a good idea to accept claim X, since it is possible for event Y.Example #1:> Maury, you should really wear a helmut when playing chess. You can easily> get excited, fall off your chair, and crack your head open.Explanation: Every decision you make has both costs and benefits. Fallaciousarguments, like the one above, will attempt to get you to make a decision out offear rather than reason, thus increasing the perceived cost of choosing not towear a helmut. Of course, the cost of wearing a helmut while playing chess ispeer ridicule of historic proportions.Example #2:> If Hell is real, then you would be wise to spend your life worshipping Jesus.Explanation: The attempt is to get you to make a decision out of fear ratherthan reason, thus increasing the perceived cost of choosing not to worship Jesusfor your whole life. There are many Christians who reject the idea of Hell andeternal torment by a perfectly loving God. And of course, there are over abillion people who subscribe to the religion that believes accepting anyonebesides Allah will buy you a one way ticket into the fiery pits of Hell. Through reason, you can evaluate these choices and make a decision on reason,not on fear.Exception: When you can come to a reasonable conclusion that preparing for theworst-case scenario is the most economically sound course of action (as incost/benefit - not necessarily financial), then the fallacy is not committed.Tip: The example above is a version of Pascal’s Wager.

In judging the validity of hypotheses or conclusions from anobservation, the scientific method relies upon the Principle of Parsimony, alsoknown as Occam’s Razor, which states, all things being equal, the simplestexplanation of a phenomenon that requires the fewest assumptions is thepreferred explanation until it can be disproved. This is very similar to the far-fetched hypothesis[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_094.html#filepos419896], but thehypotheses are generally more within reason (i.e. no leprechauns involved).Logical Form:> Hypothesis X is used to explain Y, but hypothesis X is the least plausible.Example #1:> Here is why I think my date never showed up: her father had a heart-attack and> she had to rush him to the hospital.

It is much more probable thathis date just forgot or has purposely stood him up. People tend to believe inleast probable hypotheses out of desire, emotion, or faith – not out of reason.Example #2: Creationists have written volumes of books explaining how, givensome divine intervention, a few broken natural laws, and accepting theinconsistency of nature, it could be possible that the universe is only 6000years old. Accepting these theories would require the abandonment or radicalreformation of virtually every science we have, as well us a new understandingof the term, “fact”. So either all of that is true, or, the Biblical creationstory, like hundreds of others in cultures all around the world, are simplymythology.Explanation: Given the incomprehensible number and severity of the assumptionsthat would need to be made for creationism to be true, the explanation that thecreation story is mythology, by far, is the most economical explanation.Exception: Anything is possible, Occam’s Razor is all about probabilities."},{"pageContent":"Limited DepthDescription: Failing to appeal to an underlying cause, and instead simply appealto membership in a category.

By referring to your dog as a member of the category“dog”, this fails to explain anything.Example #2:> Christians are kind people because they go to church.Explanation: Question begging[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_059.html#filepos296752] aside, simplystating that they are a member of the group, “church goers” does not explain whythey are kind.

This can result in the over-confidence in probability theoryor simply not knowing exactly where it applies, as opposed to chaotic situationsor situations with external influences too subtle or numerous to predict.Example #1: The best example of this fallacy is presented by the person whocoined this term, Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2007 book, The Black Swan. There are two people:> Dr. John, who is regarded as a man of science and logical thinking.> Fat Tony, who is regarded as a man who lives by his wits.A third party asks them, \"assume a fair coin is flipped 99 times, and each timeit comes up heads. What are the odds that the 100th flip would also come upheads?\" Dr. John says that the odds are not affected by the previous outcomesso the odds must still be 50:50. Fat Tony says that the odds of the coincoming up heads 99 times in a row are so low (less than 1 in 6.33 × 1029) thatthe initial assumption that the coin had a 50:50 chance of coming up heads ismost likely incorrect.Explanation: You can imagine yourself watching a coin flip. Knowing all aboutthe gambler’s fallacy[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_096.html#filepos425384], you would holdout much longer than someone like Fat Tony when you get to the point where yousay, “All right, something’s going on here with the coin”. At what point doesit become fallacious reasoning to still insist that you are just witnessing the“inevitable result of probability”? There is no definite answer – yourdecision will need to be argued and supported by solid reasons.Example #2:> Lolita: Since about half the people in the world are female, the chances of> the next person to walk out that door being female is about 50/50.> Celina: Do you realize that is the door to Dr. Vulvastein, the gynecologist?Explanation: Lolita is focusing on pure statistics while ignoring actual reason.Exception: See the explanation for example #1.> Note: Chaos theory plays a huge role in our universe, and it is way beyond the> scope of this book.

With such a loose definition, it is not hardto imagine one collecting and measuring the data that only supports her desiredoutcome for the “numbers”. Furthermore, what is a “huge spike”?

Not a big deal, and if shown on a graph with a vertical axis of 0% to 100%, theline connecting the 20% to the 22% would be barely inclined. However, if shownon a graph with a vertical axis of 20% to 25%, the line connecting the 20% tothe 22% would appear to be a huge spike. The same exact data, a very differentpresentation.Example #2:> Looking at that pie chart, there is a very small percentage of people who> declare themselves atheist. Therefore, atheism is not that popular of a> belief.Explanation: First, atheism is not a belief – it is a lack of one. Second,many non-believers are not even familiar with the term, “atheist”, and oftenconsider themselves Christian, Jewish, or some other religion, based on theirculture and family tradition, not necessarily their beliefs. Statistics don’taccount for this.Exception: At times, careful and honest explanations of the data and thepresentation can void statistical fallacies, but like virtually all exceptions,this can be debatable.Variation: Misunderstanding the nature of statistics is related to this fallacy,but the fallacy rests on the person interpreting the statistics.

But that is half of all the doctors in the world, and to beexpected."},{"pageContent":"Magical Thinking(also known as: post hoc fallacy [form of], superstitious thinking)Description: Making causal connections or correlations between two events notbased on logic or evidence, but primarily based on superstition.

Several months later, it rains. Praise God!Explanation: Suggesting that appealing to the gods for rain via prayer or danceis just the kind of thing crazy enough to get you elected President of theUnited States, but there is absolutely no logical reason or evidence to supportthe claim that appealing to the gods will make it rain.Example #2:> I refuse to stay on the 13th floor of any hotel because it is bad luck. > However, I don’t mind staying on the same floor as long as we call it the> 14th floor.Explanation: This demonstrates the kind of magical thinking that so many peoplein this country engage in, that, according to Dilip Rangnekar of Otis Elevators,an estimated 85% of buildings with elevators did not have a floor numbered“13”. There is zero evidence that the number 13 has any property that causesbad luck – of course, it is the superstitious mind that connects that numberwith bad luck.Example #3:> I knew I should have helped that old lady across the road. Because I didn’t,> I have been having bad Karma all day.Explanation: This describes how one who believes that they deserve bad fortune,will most likely experience it due to the confirmation bias and otherself-fulfilling prophecy-like behavior.

But to say thatDebbie and TJ must have at least one son, is to confuse the scope of the modal,or in this case, to take the contingent fact that applies to the specific casethat is conditional upon Debbie and TJ having the two sons and two daughters, tothe general hypothetical case where they don’t have to have any children. Therefore, if they don’t have to have any children, then they certainly don’thave to (necessary fact) have at least one son.Example #2:> If Barak is President, then he must be 35 years-old or older.Explanation: Technically this is fallacious. There is no condition in whichsomeone necessarily is a certain age.

Thispattern continues until we arrive at an impossible request: to essentially provethat God does not exist. Despite all the objections being adequately answered,at no time does Ken concede any points or abandon the argument.Example #2: Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument forthe existence of God. Due to understanding of nature through science, many ofthe arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to bereplaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has notdefinitively answered yet. The move from creationism to intelligent design, isa prime example. Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God(although a classic argument from ignorance[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_052.html#filepos268418]), and an areawhere we very well may have a scientific answer for in the next decade, at whichtime, that “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another,thus moving the figurative goal posts farther back.Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set ofarguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument. The reason forthe difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goal postsfallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (“has to be”,“must”, “required for”, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be adhoc [CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_007.html#filepos92505] objectionsthat follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof."},{"pageContent":"Multiple Comparisons FallacyDescription: In inductive arguments, there is always a chance that theconclusion might be false, despite the truth of the premises. This is oftenreferred to as “confidence level”. In any given study or poll, there is aconfidence level of less than 100%. If a confidence level is 95%, then one outof 20 similar studies will have a false conclusion. If you make multiplecomparisons, say 20 or more where there is a 95% confidence level, you arelikely to get a false comparison. This becomes a fallacy when that falsecomparison is seen as significant rather than a statistical probability.This fallacy can be overcome by proper testing techniques and procedures thatare outside the scope of this book.Logical Form:> Out of N studies, A produced result X and B produced result Y.> Tomorrow’s headlines read, “Studies show Y”.Example #1:> 100 independent studies were conducted comparing brain tumor rates of those> who use cell phones to those who don’t.> 90 of the tests showed no significant difference in the rates.> 5 of the tests showed that cell phone users were more than twice as likely to> develop tumors than those who don’t use cell phones.> 5 of the tests showed that cell phone users were half as likely to develop> tumors than those who don’t use cell phones.> FunTel Mobile’s new ad, “Studies show: Cell phone users are half as likely to> develop brain tumors!”Explanation: Because we did multiple tests, i.e. compared multiple groups,statistically we are likely to get results that fall within the acceptablemargin of error. These must be disregarded as anomalies or tested further, butnot taken to be meaningful while ignoring the other results.Example #2:> In our study, we looked at 100 individuals who prayed right before going to> bed, and 100 individuals who did not pray.

Out of all the comparisons, most, weremeaningless, thus were discarded. But as expected via the law statistics andprobability, there were some anomalies, the sleeping position being the mostdramatic.

However, if we did transpose the antecedent and the consequent in theconclusion, it would be a perfectly valid formal argument, even though thepremise might not be a reasonable assumption. Remember, a valid, nonfallacious formal argument does not have to have a true conclusion, it justneeds to be truth-preserving – in the case that the premises are all true.> If Barry Manilow sings love songs, then he is gay.> Therefore, if Barry Manilow is not gay, then he does not sing love songs.Example #2:> If Tom thinks that all people who sing love songs are gay, then he is an> idiot.> Therefore, if Tom doesn’t think that all people who sing love songs are gay,> then he is not an idiot.Explanation: We have the same problem with the failure to transpose theantecedent (Tom thinks that all people who sing love songs are gay) with theconsequent (he is an idiot) in the conclusion, although we did negate themboth.

During this time, and especially after theArmageddon date had passed, many Christian groups publicly declared that Campingis not a “true Christian”. On a personal note, I think Camping was, and is, asmuch of a Christian than any other self-proclaimed Christian, and,religious/political/ethical beliefs aside, I admire him for having the cahunasto make a falsifiable claim about his religious beliefs.Example #2:> John: Once you accept Jesus as your savior, you will never stray from the> LORD, hallelujah!> Marvin: Then why are there so many X-Christians?> John: They were never true Christians.> Marvin: What’s a true Christian?> John: Those who have the Holy Spirit.Explanation: This is a very common form of this fallacy that has manyvariations. Every time one Christian denounces another Christian for doing orsaying something that they don’t approve of, usually by the phrase, “he is notreally a true Christian”, this fallacy is committed.The universal claim here is that no Christian (as defined as one who acceptsJesus as his or her savior) will ever (universal) stray from the LORD. Marvinpoints out how clearly this is counterfactual, as there are millions of formerChristians. Instead of conceding or meaningfully revising the claim, theimplication that no Christian will stray is changed to “no true Christian”,which is not meaningful because John’s definition of a “true Christian”apparently can only be demonstrated in the negative if a Christian leaves thefaith.

An adult, middle-eastern> male is just as likely to be a terrorist as a four-year old American girl.Explanation: While anything is possible, including a four year-old American girlbeing a terrorist, profiling works on probabilities. Inserting politicalcorrectness here goes against reason in asserting that every person is just aslikely to be a terrorist.Example #2:> The masked individual who committed the crime was about 6’2”, and took down> four male security guards by hand. It is just as likely that the criminal> was a woman.Explanation: While it is certainly possible that a 6’2” female martial-artsmaster is the criminal, it is highly unlikely, and it would be a waste ofresources to question an even number of men and women based on the desire not todiscriminate.Example #3:> Everyone is entitled to his or her own religious beliefs. So if dancing in> the streets naked is part of their ritual, we must extend them that right.Explanation: Are any and all religiously-based behaviors acceptable? Must weallow all expression of religion? Where do we draw the line and why?Example #4:> Sacrificing virgins is part of that tribes culture and heritage. Therefore,> it is just as acceptable as our culture’s tradition of eating a hot dog at a> baseball game.Explanation: Here we enter the realm of morality and choose to protect a“cultural belief” over saving the life of a young girl.

Inthis case, the fact that 9 out of 10 kids don’t have siblings is outside of thenorm, but that is the nature of probability. If you were hypothesizing thatmost kids don’t have siblings, and you found this data, then it would providemore of a reason to due further research in making a more justified conclusion.

The implication is that Catholics who don’t resist impurethoughts are “bad Catholics”, which is not fair – they may just not be as strongwilled, or perhaps they don’t buy into the mind-control portion of the religion.Example #2:> Students who want to succeed in life will do their homework each and every> night.Explanation: The assertion is that students who don’t do their homework everynight don’t want to succeed in life, which is bad reasoning. Perhaps thestudent is sick one night, tired, doesn’t understand the work, or was busymaking out with his father’s secretary in the office supply closet, next to thememo pads.

The inability to, “prove”, in any sense of the word, that theghost of Elvis is not visiting Sheila in her dreams is an impossible request,because there is no test that proves the existence and presence of a ghost, sono way to prove the negative or the non-existence. It is up to Sheila toprovide proof of this claim, or at least acknowledge that actually being visitedby Elvis’ ghost is just a possibility, no matter how slim that possibility is.Exception: If Ron were to say, “That is impossible”, “there is no way you arebeing visited”, or make some other claim that rules out any possibility, nomatter how remote (or crazy), then Sheila would be in the right to ask him forproof – as long as she is making a point that he cannot know that for certain,and not actually expecting him to produce proof.Tip: If you think you are being visited by aliens, gods, spirits, ghosts, or anyother magical beings, just ask them for information that you can verify,specifically with a neutral third-party, that would prove their existence.

Arguments which use universals such as, “always”, “never”,“everyone”, “nobody”, etc., are prone to being reduced to absurd conclusions. The fallacy is in the argument that could be reduced to absurdity – so inessence, reductio ad absurdum is a technique to expose the fallacy.Logical Form:> Assume P is true.> From this assumption, deduce that Q is true.> Also deduce that Q is false.> Thus, P implies both Q and not Q (a contradiction, which is necessarily> false).> Therefore, P itself must be false.Example #1:> I am going into surgery tomorrow.

From this, we can deduce that God responds to popular opinion. But if Godsimply granted prayers based on popularity contests, that would be both unjustand absurd. Since God cannot be unjust, then he cannot both respond topopularity and not respond to popularity, the claim is absurd, and thus false.Example #2:> If everyone lived his or her life like Jesus lived his, the world would be a> beautiful place!Explanation: We first assume the premise is true: if everyone lived his or herlife like Jesus lived his, the world would be a beautiful place.

Hitler is probably the most universally despised figure in history, soany connection to Hitler, or his beliefs, can (erroneously) cause others to viewthe argument in a similar light. However, this fallacy is becoming more wellknown, as is the fact that it is most often a desperate attempt to render thetruth claim of the argument invalid out of lack of a good counter argument.Logical Form:> Person 1 suggests that Y is true.> Hitler liked Y.> Therefore, Y is false.> > Person 1 suggests that Y is true.> Person 1’s rhetoric sounds a bit like Hitler’s.> Therefore, Y is false.Example #1:> Peter Gibbons: It's NOT wrong.

Many people aren't aware of how easyit is to make something look like confirmation of a claim after the fact,especially if the source of the confirmation is something in which they alreadybelieve, like Biblical prophecies, psychic predictions, astrological horoscopes,fortune cookies, and more.Example #1: This example is taken from the Skeptic’s Dictionary(http://www.skepdic.com/shoehorning.html[http://www.skepdic.com/shoehorning.html]). > After the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on> September 11, 2001, fundamentalist Christian evangelists Jerry Falwell and Pat> Robertson shoehorned the events to their agenda. They claimed that \"liberal> civil liberties groups, feminists, homosexuals and abortion rights supporters> bear partial responsibility...because their actions have turned God's anger> against America.\" According to Falwell, God allowed \"the enemies of> America...to give us probably what we deserve.\" Robertson agreed. The American> Civil Liberties Union has \"got to take a lot of blame for this,\" said Falwell> and Robertson agreed.

Without a doubt, the same verses havebeen used over and over again for centuries as a prophecy of a current event. This is shoehorning. A great example of this is the BP oil spill in April of2010. It has been suggested that the verses from Revelation 8:8–11 predictedthis environmental disaster:> “The second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a great mountain,> burning with fire, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea became blood, a> third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were> destroyed … A third of the waters became wormwood, and many died from the> water, because it was made bitter.” With over 31,000 verses, the probability of NOT finding a verse in the Biblethat can be made to fit virtually any modern-day situation is next to zero.

Therefore, we should keep her locked up in the closet.Explanation: In this example, it starts out with reasonable effects to thecauses. For example, yes, if the child is allowed to go free in her room, shewould most likely want to roam the house – 95% probability estimate11[CR%213TRA0D16PD2VDDD8CY4SRH279VG7_split_187.html#filepos775262]. Sure, if sheroams the house, she will probably want the freedom of going outside, but notnecessarily “roaming the neighborhood”, but let’s give that a probability of say10%. Now we start to get very improbable. The chances of her getting pickedup by a stranger (.05%) in a van (35%) to sell her into sex slavery (.07%) inanother country (40%) is next to nothing when you do all the math:.95 x .10 x .0005 x .35 x .0007 x .4 = about 1 in 25,000,000.Morality and legality aside, is it really worth it to keep a child locked in acloset based on those odds?Example #2:> If you accept that the story of Adam and Eve was figurative, then you will do> the same for most of the Old Testament stories of similar literary styles. > Once you are there, the New Testament and the story of Jesus does not make> sense, which will lead you to believe that the resurrection of Jesus was a> “spiritual” one.

He is a good boy who just made a mistake!Explanation: The mother in this example has applied the rule that all drunkdrivers should go to prison.

Exception: None.Tip: To see how fallacious Anselm’s argument really is, check out mydeconstruction of it in detail athttp://www.relationshipwithreason.com/articles/religion/15-ontologically-incorrect-how-anselm-s-ontological-argument-fails[http://www.relationshipwithreason.com/articles/religion/15-ontologically-incorrect-how-anselm-s-ontological-argument-fails]."},{"pageContent":"Weak Analogy(also known as: bad analogy, false analogy, faulty analogy, questionableanalogy, argument from spurious similarity, false metaphor)Description: When an analogy is used to prove or disprove an argument, but theanalogy is too dissimilar to be effective, that is, it is unlike the argumentmore than it is like the argument.Logical Form:> X is like Y.> Y has property P.> Therefore, X has property P.> (but X really is not too much like Y)Example #1:> Not believing in the literal resurrection of Jesus because the Bible has> errors and contradictions, is like denying that the Titanic sunk because> eye-witnesses did not agree if the ship broke in half before or after it sunk.Explanation: This is an actual analogy used by, I am sorry to say, one of myfavorite Christian debaters (one who usually seems to value reason and logic). There are several problems with this analogy, including:> • The Titanic sunk in recent history> • We know for a fact that the testimonies we have are of eye-witnesses> • We have physical evidence of the sunken TitanicExample #2:> How can you possibly look at something so elegant as a rose, and not see that> it must have been designed by an intelligent designer? That is like walking> on the beach, finding a watch, and not recognizing that it had an intelligent> designer!Explanation: A rose is like a watch as in they both look as if they weredesigned. A rose is unlike a watch in thousands of ways including:> • a rose is living, a watch is not> • a rose is guided by evolution, a watch is not> • a rose makes copies of itself with variations in the DNA, a watch does not,> etc.Exception: It is important to note that analogies cannot be “faulty” or“correct”, and even calling them “good” or “bad” is not as accurate as referringto them as either “weak” or “strong”. The use of an analogy is an argument initself, the strength of which is very subjective. What is weak to one person,is strong to another.Tip: Analogies are very useful, powerful, and persuasive ways to communicateideas. Use them – just make them strong."},{"pageContent":"Willed IgnoranceDescription: Refusing to change one’s mind or consider conflicting information.Logical Form:> I believe X.> You have evidence for Y.> I don’t want to see it.Example #1:> I don’t want anything coming in the way of me an my faith, therefore, I will> only socialize with people who share my beliefs.Explanation: This is a common form of the fallacy – excluding oneself fromsociety as a whole to smaller subgroups where the same general opinions areshared.Example #2:> I know what I know, and I refuse to debate!Explanation: Refusing to “debate”, or consider other information is a refusal toreason.Exception: Refusing to reason with a non-reasonable person would be anexception, but it is also a contradiction."},{"pageContent":"Wishful Thinking(also known as: appeal to consequences [form of])Description: When the desire for something to be true is used in place of/or asevidence for the truthfulness of the claim. Wishful thinking, more as acognitive bias than a logical fallacy, can also cause one to evaluate evidencevery differently based on the desired outcome.Logical Form:> I wish X were true.> Therefore, it is true.Example #1:> I know in my heart of hearts that our home team will win the World Series.Explanation: No, you don’t know that. And what the heck is, “heart of hearts”anyway? This is classic wishful thinking – wanting the home team to win sopretending that it is/has to be true.Example #2:> I believe that when we die, we are all given new, young, perfect bodies, and> we spend eternity with those whom we love. I can’t imagine the point of life> if it all just ends when we die!Explanation: The fact that one doesn’t like the idea of simply not existing isnot evidence for the belief. Besides, nobody seemed to mind the eternity theydidn’t exist before they were born.Exception: When wishful thinking is expressed as a hope, wish, or prayer, and nobelief is formed as a result, then it is not a fallacy because no direct orindirect argument is being made.> I really hope that I don’t have to spend my eternity with my aunt Edna, who> really loved me, but she drove me nuts with her constant jabbering.Tip: Wishing for something to be true is a powerful technique when and onlywhen, a) you have influence on what it is you want to be true and b) you takeaction to make it come true – not just wish for it to be true.
