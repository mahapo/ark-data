The Four Mental Attitudes Gerald F. Kein When an individual is in hypnosis and hears a suggestion s/he must take one of four mental attitudes about that suggestion. Which mental attitude the person takes will determine whether the suggestion is accepted or rejected. The subject has no alternative but to choose one of the following mental attitudes when he/she hears a suggestion. Mental Attitude # 1 \"I like that suggestion. I know it's going to work for me!\" Mental Attitude # 2 \"I don't know; it sounds a little uncomfortable to me. It just doesn't fit me.\" Mental Attitude #3 \"I'm neutral about it. I don't care if I get it or don't get it.\" Mental Attitude # 4 \"I like that suggestion. I hope it works!\" The only mental attitude that will cause the suggestion to be accepted is #1. Any other will cause the suggestion to be rejected and there will be no change. You must educate your clients on these choices during the pre-talk!"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Pre-induction Interview Hello, I'm _. I'd like to spend a few moments with you before your session to talk a little bit about hypnosis, perhaps answer some of the questions you may have on your mind. This will save us a lot of time when your session actually begins. You have a clipboard and a piece of paper, please write down any questions you have so we can discuss them when I come into the office. Now for you to understand how hypnosis works, it is very important for you to understand how your mind works. You know we never think about how our mind works. We basically say to ourselves, if we think about it, I think so I exist and we leave it go at that. But you know we really have three very separate and very distinct minds. They do different things and they have a hard time inter-relating and communicating with each other. First we have the conscious mind. Well, that's where we are right now. Below that level of awareness, we have something called the subconscious mind. And yet there is a still deeper part of us, the unconscious mind. Well, for the reason you are here today, we can eliminate the unconscious mind. Basically, that is a part of us that does two things. First, it controls the strength or weakness of immune system and, secondly, it controls the functions, the automatic body functions, such as; our heart beating, our eyes blinking and things on this order. We don't have to worry about these today, so let's just forget about that part of us for now. The conscious mind is where we spend most of our time. I want you to understand that it basically only does four things and no more. The first thing it does, it analyzes. What is that? Well, that is the part of us that looks at problems, analyzes them, figures a way to solve those particular problems bothering us at the moment. It is also the part of us that makes the hundreds of decisions we have to make just to get through an average day, decisions we think are automatic; but in fact, are not. Things like, \"Should I open the door?\" \"Should I turn the water on?\" \"Should I tie my shoes?\" Well, we think those are automatic functions, but we must make a decision as to whether or not we want to do these things. Now, the second part of the conscious mind is a part that starts to get us into a little trouble sometimes. We call this the rational part of our conscious mind. This part of us must give us a reason why we behave in any particular fashion. You see if we don't have a reason why we do the things that we do, we become anxious, nervous, frustrated and if it goes on long enough, it can lead to serious mental illness. The mental hospitals, for example, are full of people who do things and they don't know why they do them. The only problem with the reason the rational mind may give us on why we behave in any particular fashion is number one, it is never original. For example, a smoker says he smokes because it calms him, makes him feel relaxed, gives him time to pause and gather his thoughts. An overweight person will say, I'm over weight because I eat when I'm bored, I eat when I'm nervous or I have a glandular problem. The problem with this reason is, it is never original. Before the smoker developed his habit, he heard other people that smoked say, \"I smoke because it makes me feel calm and relaxed.\" Or he heard an over weight person say, \"I'm just over weight because I eat when I'm nervous.\" 5."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"6. Pre-induction Interview The problem with this is, we understand and know the reason why people are smokers and overweight. Generally, smokers start because of their need for security. They want to belong to another gang of friends, usually in their younger years, somewhere between twelve and twenty. Security is a basic need for all human beings. We generally get all the security we need when we grow up in a nice family. But usually at the age of twelve or thirteen, in that area, our parents don't seem as smart as they use to be, so we shut off our ability to gain security from those individuals and we want that security by being part of a group of kids at school. Some of them smoke, some of them don't. If we feel that we don't belong to this particular group, because our subconscious mind is a very interesting part of us, it must protect us against danger and not getting the necessary security we need is a definite danger to us. Frequently it will say smokers are accepted and secure. When that happens, the next time someone offers you a cigarette and you take it, immediately you feel like you are part of this group and your security level goes up. That is why people start smoking. It has nothing to do with being calm or relaxed. So you must understand that the reason the rational mind gives us for why we behave in a particular fashion is never original and most always incorrect! You don't start smoking because it makes you feel calm, you start when you need security! Now, the next part of the conscious mind is what we call will power. Now, we are all familiar with will power. You might say, \"I'm going to put down this pack of cigarettes and nothing on God's earth will make me start smoking again.\" Well, we all know how long that lasts! You know if you go on a diet how long that lasts. Just until willpower weakens and then the old habit pattern comes back again. The last part of the conscious mind is what we call working memory. That's the memory we need everyday. How do I find my way to work? What's my husband or wife's name? What are my children's names? What is my phone number? Things on this order. The memory we need just to get through an average day. Now this is all that the conscious mind does. It does nothing else. I want you to think of this part of your mind. For example, if you've ever seen that show on TV called Star Trek, I'm sure you are familiar with the character called Spock. Spock is a very logical and analytical person. So our conscious mind, if you will, we call our Spock mind. Very logical and very analytical and frequently wrong. Now, where the REAL you, me and everyone else lives is in the level below the conscious called the subconscious mind. The subconscious mind is awesomely powerful. It can make you into anything you would like to be. Rich and famous, thin, happy or sad, it is the real us. To understand how the subconscious mind works, you need to understand that it is very much like a computer and it operates just like a computer operates. You know that if you go out and buy a computer, put it on your desk and ask it a question, it will not be able to answer you. The reason is, at that point the computer has no programming in it whatsoever. Now a computer can only operate based on the programming that is placed in it and it must operate on that programming, it has no choice. You know that if you change the programming in a computer that you buy at a store, it no longer can operate on the old programming and it must operate on the new programming information that has been placed into it. Well, this is the way our"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Pre-induction Interview subconscious mind works. It is a computer. It functions on the same rules and regulations as an electronic one does, only it is much more powerful. We program our computer every day of our lives through our life experiences. When we are born, our computers are basically unprogrammed, there is a little bit of programming in it, but not much. Everyday we add programming to our internal computer. Now, the primary rule of our computer is this. It must, underline, exclamation point, make us into the type of person that it perceives us to be based on all the programming that has been placed into it and will continue to be placed into it until we die. For example, if that computer of ours, based on its programming, says we're fat, we're fat. If it says we're thin or a smoker, a success or a failure that is what we are. It adds up all the programming and makes a decision about us, about the type of person that we are. This programming has been placed in there from many sources and it must operate on this programming. What is some of the operational software, if you will, that is in this internal computer? First is all our memory, since the day we were born. We think of things that have happened to us in the past as either forgotten or as retained in the form of memory. So, what we are doing here, is we are talking about the working memory of the conscious mind. The subconscious mind is like a video camera. Everything that has ever happened to you, that you have heard, seen, smelled or tasted is locked permanently into the memory banks of your subconscious mind. We never forget anything. If there is a reason to, in hypnosis we can access that memory bank and it seems like we can actually travel back in time. For example, in regression hypnosis we can travel back and re-live your first birthday or your birth. Now, this is much more than recall, it is actually like you are there, it is happening all over again. You can see what happened, you can smell, you can taste, you can hear very clearly. We never forget anything in the subconscious, only at the conscious level. The second programming we have in the inner mind, the subconscious mind, is habits. Now, you have three kinds of habits. Only three. You know you have some good habits, of course you do, and you know you have some bad habits. Don't we all. But really most of our habits aren't good or bad, most of our habits really are utilitarian habits. We automatically respond in a certain fashion when something else happens. When the telephone rings, for example, we don't look at it and wonder what it is, we automatically pick it up and depending on our mood, we answer it in a certain manner. Now the next thing in our subconscious mind is emotion. Of course, we wouldn't want to be without our emotions, love and caring and all those other good emotions, but sometimes our emotions get us into trouble. The conscious mind cannot deal with emotions in any way, that is not part of its job. Any time we need emotion our conscious mind parts like the Red Sea and we deal with this particular situation from our irrational, juvenile like, but highly intelligent subconscious mind. As I said, sometimes it gets us into trouble, I know that many times in the past you've dealt with a situation and it didn't have to have a lot of emotion, just a little bit. 7."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"8. Pre-induction Interview Then after the situation was over and that analytical conscious mind took over again, you heard yourself thinking or saying something like this, \"Why did I say that?\" \"Why did I do that, it was so stupid.\" And that inner subconscious mind laughed and said, \"Yeah, but it was so much fun.\" This has happened to all of us at some time or other. Now, the next thing in the subconscious mind, and probably the most important part of it is our protective mind. It must protect us against danger real OR imagined. You see something imagined by the subconscious mind is just as if it was actually happening, it can't tell the difference. And it must protect us against danger. A quick example, about a year ago a woman came into see me, she was five foot one, she weighed very close, just a few pounds away from 300 pounds. She sat in the chair and told me about how she had an eating problem, but years of experience told me she didn't have an eating problem. I knew that an event in her past caused her subconscious mind to protect her by making her heavy. Briefly, what happened with this particular woman was, and she could not recall this with her conscious mind, when she was just a little six year old girl, her step-father abused her, she told her mother and her mother didn't believe her. She felt guilty, as if she was doing something wrong. But she didn't get heavy at that point. When she was in high school in the fifties, she felt as if she was a little bit more promiscuous than she felt good to herself about. She felt the boys in high school were just trying to hurt her. That didn't cause her to become heavy either. But when she was twenty four years old and she married the \"white knight\", the man who could do no wrong. On their honeymoon, the second day they were married, they were having dinner in the Bahamas and he decided to cleanse his soul and show her how much he loved her. He told her that when he was just a young guy, 18, 19 years old and in the Air Force, he use to pick up women and just use them and throw them away. Well, you can imagine what the subconscious mind felt about this one man that this woman felt she could trust above every other man in the world would actually do this to a woman. The subconscious mind then went back into its memory banks and into its computer information and said, \"The step-father hurt you very badly, the boys in high school were trying to hurt you very badly and now this one man you could trust above every other man says he could do this to a woman, then he certainly has the capability of doing this to you. And instantly it made this decision, men hurt women, therefore, I must protect you against men. Now, it can't teach her karate, can't buy her a gun, so it protected her in the only way it could and this woman began gaining weight rapidly. So very soon she became very fat and certainly men no longer had an interest in her and she was protected. That is how the subconscious protects us sometimes, in a way that we would prefer it didn't, but protection is its primary job. The last part of the subconscious mind is a negative part of us. Although the subconscious is so powerful, it is also the laziest part of us. It doesn't like to do the work that is required to accept positive suggestions to give us change in areas where we would like to have change. It likes to keep things the way they are, it takes too much work to make change in a"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"9. Pre-induction Interview positive way. And positive suggestions are one of the most difficult things to get into our subconscious minds. On the other hand, negative suggestions go into this inner part of us like a hot knife through butter, because it doesn't take any work to accept a negative suggestion. Let me show you how this works. You take a very heavy person and they get out of the shower. They're standing in front of a mirror toweling off, what do you think they are saying to themselves as they are looking into that mirror? \"Boy, am I fat.\" Now that idea or thought of words go right into the subconscious mind and the subconscious mind says, \"Yes, that matches the programming that I have in here, that matches my perception of you.\" Therefore, it accepts that suggestion so the perception of that individual being fat becomes stronger and they become heavier. On the other hand, if you take that same heavy person and stand them in front of that mirror and have them say, \"I'm thin, I'm trim and I'm attractive.\" That goes toward the subconscious mind and the subconscious mind says, \"No, that does not match the programming,\" and it's not allowed in. How do we get suggestions into the inner mind? Now, it is so important for you to understand this, if an idea, a thought or a concept is allowed to go into the subconscious mind, it must happen. You are changing programming and that inner mind must respond to new programming. But it is not that easy. Let me explain how it works. You make a decision, oh, let's say to stop smoking. You make your mind up at the conscious level that nothing in the world is going to stop you from ending the smoking habit. Now, your conscious mind says, \"That's wonderful and I support you one hundred percent, you are going to be healthier. You are not going to get emphysema, or heart or blood diseases.\" But, to have change effectively happen, you have got to get it down into your computer in order to change that programming. And so you say fine, and you start to send that idea down to the subconscious mind. But here is the problem. There's one more part of the conscious mind that I haven't told you about yet. I want you to think of this part of your conscious mind as kind of an employee, if you will, of the subconscious. Every Friday night the subconscious gives it its pay for the week and it does exactly what it is told and it only has one job. That job is to stop, to put on hold, like a red traffic light, any suggestion of positive change that we give ourselves or receive from an outside source. It stops it. And then in a way we don't understand, but we do know it happens, there is a communication between this part of us called the critical factor of the conscious and the subconscious mind. The critical factor says, \"Well, this person wants to stop smoking, can I let this suggestion in?\" Now remember, if that suggestion goes into the inner mind, it must happen. But the subconscious mind says, \"Wait a minute. He's been smoking for twenty years, he needs cigarettes for security.\" Or whatever reason there may be for that person. \"Besides you realize I have to do so many years of re-programming and I just don't feel up to it, I don't want to do it, reject the suggestion!\" Well, that's the critical factor's boss, so the critical factor of the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"10. Pre-induction Interview conscious mind kind of turns into a mirror and rejects that suggestion and it can not go into the inner mind. Now, we only have one other place to take that idea and that is to will power. That is in the conscious. And we all know how long will power lasts. How many diets have we been on, how many times have we tried to stop smoking. Well, how do we get suggestion into that subconscious mind? Well, in this facility we use something called hypnosis. Now, what hypnosis does is this. It by-passes the critical factor, that is blocking part of our conscious mind. It's like giving it a couple of dollars and sending it to Wendy's and we'll tell it when to come back. Now, this is what most people who are ignorant of hypnosis think hypnosis really is. If this was all hypnosis was, then some of the stories you may have heard about hypnosis might be true. Things like I can control you or I can make you do anything I want you to do and you'd have to do it. We'll if this was all it was, that would be true. But God did not leave us that vulnerable. Yet, this is true up to this point. But the instant this critical factor of our conscious mind is bypassed, what happens is this, we go into a very deep state of hypnosis. Now, when we are in the state of hypnosis, it is not what you expect it to be. Our bodies, if we are using a relaxation type of hypnosis, are very relaxed; but, the more we go into hypnosis, the more our conscious mind becomes alert. In the deeper levels of hypnosis, your conscious mind is two to three hundred percent more alert than you are at this very moment. All of your five senses, including hearing, smelling, tasting, and seeing are hundreds of times better than they are right now. So when you are in hypnosis, you are not asleep, you are extremely alert, probably more alert and clear minded than you have ever been before. Now the important thing to understand about this is that the conscious mind takes on a different role when you are in hypnosis. I want you to think of it as playing the role of the guardian of the gates protecting you. When you receive a suggestion in hypnosis, you hear it loud and clear. Now when you hear that suggestion, and these are the tools for success or failure with hypnosis. When you hear that suggestion with your conscious mind, you must, and you really do have no choice, make one of four decisions about that suggestion. Which decision you make determines whether that suggestion is allowed to enter your subconscious mind or whether it is rejected. If it is allowed to enter, you will have the change that you are here to achieve, if it is rejected, there will be no change. What are those four decisions or choices? Well, the first one could be, when you hear the suggestion, you think or say to yourself something like this, \"I like that suggestion, boy, I know that one is going to work!\" Now, that mental attitude at the conscious level allows that suggestion to go into your computer, the subconscious mind, and change begins. Unfortunately, you have three other choices. The next choice could be, well, forget actually hating a suggestion, or feeling it is something against your morals or beliefs, but perhaps that suggestion is just a tiny,"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"11. Pre-induction Interview little bit uncomfortable to you. Like that pair of shoes you wanted to buy that time, but you knew if you did, you would end up a cripple in about three months, because they just didn't fit right. Well, if that suggestion sounds just the tiniest bit uncomfortable to you for any reason, it is automatically blocked with the conscious mind and it is not allowed to enter the computerâand there is no change. The next choice could be that you are neutral about the suggestion, you don't care if you get it or you don't care if you don't get it. It is kind of a meaningless suggestion to you. The conscious mind automatically blocks that suggestion and it can not get into your computer. The last choice you have is probably the choice which causes more people to fail with hypnosis, if they do fail. It goes something like this. When you hear the suggestion, you say to yourself, \"Oh, I like that suggestion, boy, I hope it works!\" The word hope is the twin sister of the word try and try means automatic failure. If you look back on your life being honest with yourself, anytime you tried to do something, you failed. \"Okay, mom, I'll try.\" \"Okay, dad, I'll try.\" Try means failure. If you look back at your life, anytime you have said to yourself, \"I'm going to do it,\" and there was no question about it, you did it, and you probably did it very well. Hope is the twin sister of try. You could hope for the cows to come home, that doesn't mean they are going to come home. So, if you say hope or try, that suggestion is blocked by the conscious mind, it is not allowed to enter the computer and there is no change. A little thought. If you eliminate the words hope and try from your personal and professional vocabulary from this moment on, within a week you are going to feel better than you have felt in a long time. The only time a suggestion is allowed to go into your computer is if you take the mental attitude when you hear that suggestion, \"I like that suggestion, I know it's going to work.\" And that is how easy it is! Now, let me give you some real truths. The first is this, there is no such thing as hypnosis! There never has been and there never will be. I have been in the field for many, many years and I have never hypnotized a single person and I doubt that I ever will. There is only one form of hypnosis, there always has been and there always will be. ALL hypnosis is self- hypnosis. You don't need me to go into a beautiful, deep state of hypnosis all by yourself and you certainly don't need me to give you suggestions of positive change in any area of your life. You can do that all by yourself. The reason you are here today is only because you do not know how to do it! But, we teach people how to do that all the time. It's the easiest thing in the world. But all I can ever be for you or anybody else is not a hypnotist, because if I called myself a hypnotist, that means I could do something and I guess you are suppose to respond in a certain fashion and I can't do that. The reality and the truth is all I can ever be is a guide for you, and nothing more. If you allow me to be your guide, I'll show you how to place yourself in a beautiful state of hypnosis. Feeling the physical relaxation and mental alertness. If you allow me to be your guide, I'll show you how to stay there until we're finished. If you don't want to be in this beautiful relaxed state, the slightest thought by you and it is over and you are back to your normal state of awareness. But, if you follow my guidance, I'll show you how to stay there."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"12. Pre-induction Interview And then the most important thing of all is, if you accept the suggestions given to you with the correct mental attitude, I like it, I know it's going to work, you'll have change in the way you want it. If you take one of the other choices, you'll fail. I can't force a suggestion into your mind. Only YOU can ALLOW it to happen. Hypnosis is a 100% consent state by you. You must allow things to happen. You can stop them from happening with the slightest thought if you don't want it to happen. Now, I want you to understand that anyone, as long as their IQ is above 70 and they want hypnosis, can go into a very deep level of hypnosis, how fast? (SNAP FINGERS) Just like that! The only thing that keeps a person from going into that beautiful state of physical relaxation and mental alertness is if they have a fear or a misconception about what hypnosis really is and I would like to talk briefly about some of the more common fears and misconceptions of hypnosis. Some people feel that when you are in hypnosis, that you are asleep. Well, I want you to know that when your mind is three or four hundred percent more alert than you are at this very moment, this is about as far from sleep that you are ever going to get, in this lifetime anyway. Hypnosis has nothing to do with sleep. Some people are afraid they won't \"wake up\" from hypnosis and that is true, I agree with that, I have never known anyone to \"wake up\" from hypnosis. You see there is only one thing you can \"wake up\" from and that is sleep. If you are not asleep, you can't \"wake up.\" Semantics, yes, but we use words in our profession. They are our only tools. The term is emerge from hypnosis. Anytime you would want to emerge from hypnosis, all you have to do is have the slightest thought that you don't want to be in this relaxed state anymore and instantly, it's over and you are back to your normal awareness. Then there is that powerful misconception that some people have that says I can control you and make you do anything I want you to do. I have to be honest with you, I wish that was true, because than I could guarantee you success. But remember you have those four choices when you hear a suggestion and that the only time the suggestion is allowed to enter your computer is if you say, \"I like it, I know it's going to work.\" I can't force that in, I can't control you! I want you to know that you and you alone are responsible for your success. You and you alone are responsible for your failure. What mental attitude you take when you hear a suggestion determines success or failure. Some people have the misconception that they will tell me all their deep dark secrets when they are in hypnosis. For the same reasons of mental alertness, you are more in control of anything you choose to do or say while you are in hypnosis then you are right now. If you don't want to tell me something, then you won't. If I was to ask you for information that was none of my business, you would simply tell me it is none of my business. No one can make you divulge information that is proprietary. As a matter of fact, if I wanted that kind of information from you, I would have a much better chance of obtaining it now, in your normal conscious"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"13. Pre-induction Interview awareness, because right now, you are mentally dull compared to your mental capabilities when you are in hypnosis. Some people say, \"Wait a minute, wait a minute, I hear what you are saying, but I've seen stage hypnotists work and I know those people control those folks.\" \"I've seen them bark like dogs and think they have body odor,\" or something on this order. Many years ago, when I was a young man, I was a stage hypnotist. Let me tell you how it works. When a stage hypnotist comes to town, there is advertising and a lot of people are interested so they show up. They want to see the show and a lot of them would like to be volunteers as subjects for the stage hypnotist. Now, when that stage hypnotist comes out and gives a little bit of a short lecture on hypnosis saying he is showing the entertainment side of hypnosis and there is a clinical side, he tells the people, \"You know this whole show depends on you, the audience, you're the people that I need for the show.\" And he asks the people, \"Is there anybody here who will volunteer to come up on stage?\" Well, you would be amazed how many hands go up! But that stage hypnotist does not necessarily take those people at all. He tells those people, \"You know,\" he says, \"really good subjects are those individuals who have the best ability to imagine, a wonderful imagination and the ability to concentrate,\" and he says he will give the whole audience a test for imagination and concentration. He is kind of telling a little fib, for he is testing the audience to find out two very important things. First, who goes into hypnosis like this (SNAP FINGERS). He has a stage show to put on, he can't waste time with long hypnotic techniques. More importantly, he is testing those people to find out who wants to have fun and who is uninhibited in public. These are the people he invites up on stage. They usually enter hypnosis very rapidly and very easily. And those people when they hear the suggestion, because they want to have fun, take the mental attitude, I like it, I want it to work and it does. Many times on the stage, a person thinks they want to do these things, but when it comes time to actually have it happen, they don't have the correct mental attitude and the suggestion is ineffective. These people, the stage hypnotist sends back to their seats, or, if it's long enough into the show, he will sit them on a stage chair and ignore them for the rest of the show. Stage hypnosis operates by the same rules as clinical hypnosis, you always have the choice as to whether or not you want that suggestion. If you don't want it, truthfully don't want it, it will be rejected and there will be no change. So, you see, hypnosis is up to you. People ask me what my success rate is with smoking or weight control. I have to be honest with those people. My success rate is 100%. I've had an awful lot of training in hypnosis for an awful lot of years. I know exactly what to say to my clients and if they accept those suggestions, they'll have wonderful change and if they reject them they will have no change. So my success rate is always perfect. Will yours be perfect? If you accept the suggestions with the correct mental attitude, I like it, I know it will work, yes, you'll have 100% success. If you accept with any other ideas you will fail. It is up to you. I"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"14.

This process helps save time, the hypnotist's voice and assures each client receives the same quality pre-talk through the longest of session days. It also allows the hypnotist to make use of this time for other things; such as, finishing up with the previous client, returning calls etc. It is meant as a guide on how to educate the client regarding hypnosis and the hypnotic procedure prior to the induction portion of the the session.

PATTER: I want you to look down at one of your hands (pause). Which hand have you chosen please? Fine, continue to look at your hand in an easy, dreamy sort of way. Easily and effortlessly, as opposed to a hard concentration. Now take a slow deep breath. As you sit there, perfectly still, motionless, that's not really true, because when you stop to think about it, no matter how still you are, there is always some movement, some motion taking place in your body. For example, your heart is beating. The beating of your heart is motion EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE SITTING STILL As a matter of fact, many people can feel their heart beat if they concentrate on it. You're breathing, your lungs function. THIS IS MOTION EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE SITTING STILL. So you see , EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE SITTING STILL there is always some motion, some movement taking place within your body. AND BY THE SAME TOKEN, as you look at your hand, you're going to notice some motion of some sort. You may notice it visually or feel it. A finger might twitch a muscle or a nerve. Different people, of course, have different reactions. Occasionally, the hand feels heavy. But usually, and this is the most interesting thing you probably will be interested in seeing; usually the hand begins to feel light. It's going to feel lighter and lighter. Soon your hand will feel so light, that it will just want to float up, as though my hand is drawing it up. I want you to let your hand do whatever it wants. Don't help it, don't hinder it. As it begins to feel lighter and lighter it will start to lift up. It probably wants to lift up now. If it feels like it does, just let it lift up. Lighter and lighter, things are moving now. Think as though my hand is actually drawing it up. It gets lighter and lighter. Lighter and lighter, starting to lift up now, higher and higher. Imagine I am tying a string to your hand and it is attached to a large helium filled balloon, floating above your head. As you know, helium is lighter than air so it rises. It makes your hand lighter and lighter. Higher, and higher. Let your hand start to rise higher and higher. Keep going and point out motion until hand off leg. AFTER HAND OFF LEG As you watch your hand rise, you begin to feel a sense of relaxation. Higher, and higher. All the muscles of your body, especially your eye muscles, will soon feel so relaxed you'll want to close your eyes. But please do not close your eyes until your hand touches your face. Even though you would like to close your eyes, don't do it until your hand touches your face. Your hand will rise progressively faster and faster until it touches your face. Then you can close your eyes because I know you would like to do that, but please do not close them until your hand touches your face. Let it go higher and higher. It's approaching your face.

Abnormal Reactions Abnormal reaction from hypnotized subjects are rare, but if you are using hypnosis extensively, there is always a possibility of encountering one of them. The only sure safeguard against any of these examples happening is to have a complete physical, mental and life history on every one of your clients. Of course this is impossible, therefore, your only alternative is to be able to recognize these abnormalities and know how to cope with them. EMOTIONAL OUTLET - Hypnosis produces a natural emotional outlet. A subject may be perfectly normal until hypnotized. Then may begin to toss and turn or exhibit other unusual signs. While in a normal waking state, the subject has control over these idiosyncrasies, but in hypnosis the emotions are turned loose. Avoid working with this client if he continues to react negatively. SUPPRESSED EMOTIONS - An example of this would be when a client is placed in hypnosis and begins to cry...for no apparent reason. Usually something very depressing has happened to the client in the near past, like a death in the family. This subject holds his emotions in check until hypnotized, when he lets his guard down and lets out his suppressed emotions. Allow the client to go ahead and cry.. .and tell him that it is good to let these suppressed emotions out. After a few minutes tell the subject to stop crying... and just relax. Continue with the session only if your client wishes to. ABREACTIONS - Are traumatic episodes brought out by suggestion. They occur when a subject begins to cry, scream or becomes hysterical only AFTER SUGGESTION HAS BEEN GIVEN. This is common when age regressing a subject who has had an unpleasant childhood or a traumatic experience in the past. An abreaction can also be caused by suggesting a scene closely related to that of a traumatic event. For example... a suggestion was given to a woman that she was relaxing and sunning on the beach when some dark clouds appeared. The clouds covered the sun, the wind picked up, and it began to rain. The suggestion, seemingly harmless, was given to produce hot and cold sensations. Instead, the subject immediately began to cry. Her crying stopped after she was instructed to forget the suggestion and just relax. It was later discovered she had subconsciously recalled a similar situation when she was a little girl playing on the beach with her friends. Only then, along with the rain and dark clouds was lightening, which killed her girlfriend. This whole experience was completely forgotten and only after much questioning was she able to consciously remember any traumatic event ever happening. ARTIFICIAL TRAUMATIC EVENTS - Can be created by giving improper suggestions, ie., being chased by a beast, having a truck pull out in front of you while driving at high speed etc. You may enjoy watching your subjects reaction, as with stage hypnosis, but in a clinical environment it is unethical. The subject would probably refuse further suggestions and there would be the possibility of physical damage to the client. These techniques should not be used under any circumstances."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"22.

AMNESIA, HYPNOTIC Loss of ability to recall past experiences occurring during hypnosis. When reaching a certain level of trance, the natural tendency of an individual not to carry back to the conscious mind the experiences of the trance state. This trance depth varies with each individual. The individual always knows what is happening while they are in this state and all protections apply. AMNESIA, POST - HYPNOTIC The subconscious mind will not allow the client to remember experiences in the hypnotic state that it feels would cause him or her the inability to function in normal life. Suggestions for amnesia given by the hypnotist concerning something against the clients moral or religious character, if accepted, will become ineffective in approximately 72 hours. AMNESIA, SPONTANEOUS A form of amnesia occurring in a subject without receiving any suggestion to this effect. Spontaneous amnesia is a simple psychological defense mechanism.

Hypnosis Vocabulary BRAID, JAMES (1795-1860) A Manchester, England physician and the author or Neurohypnology (1843), who discovered that the so-called \"animal magnetics\" had actually nothing to do with any magnetic influence and consequenlty gave modern name to the science of hypnotism. He used, at first, the method of fascination, but later turned to verbal suggestion. Among other things, he availed himself of hypnosis to perform painless surgical operations. CATALEPSY A form of high suggestibility in which the subject can obtain rigidity of muscle groups through suggestion. \"Arm rigid, cannot bend. Eyes stuck tightly, cannot open.\" CHEVREUL PENDULUM Originally designed by M. Chevreul, any weight object suspended by a chain or string about 15 in long.

ESDAILE, JAMES (1808-1859) Of Edinburg; having heard, while in Calcutta, of the anesthetic use of hypnosis, he turned to it \"to relieve the pain of a Hindu convict who was about to undergo a painful operation.\" Within several months he reported 75 successful and painless major operations and several thousand minor operations with uniformly painless results. This included nineteen amputations. FASCINATION The method of hypnotizing by fixation of eyes on a small shining object held a little above the subject's eyes. Originally introduced by James Braid.

Rules of the Mind Rule Number One: EVERY THOUGHT OR IDEA CAUSES A PHYSICAL REACTION. Your thoughts can affect all of the functions of your body. WORRY thoughts trigger changes in the stomach that in time can lead to ulcers. ANGER thoughts stimulate your adrenal glands and increased adrenaline in the blood stream causes many body changes. ANXIETY and FEAR thoughts affect your pulse rate. Ideas that have a strong emotional content almost always reach the subconscious mind, because it is the feeling mind. Once accepted, these ideas continue to produce the same body reaction over and over again. In order to eliminate or change chronic negative bodily reactions, we must reach the subconscious mind and change the idea responsible for the reaction. This is done with self-hypnosis and autosuggestion. Rule Number Two: WHAT IS EXPECTED TENDS TO BE REALIZED. The brain and the nervous system respond only to mental images. It does not matter if the image is self-induced or from the external world. The mental image formed becomes the blueprint, and the subconscious mind uses every means at its disposal to carry out the plan. Worry is a form of programming a picture of what we don't want, but the subconscious mind acts to fulfill the pictured situation. \"THE THINGS THAT I HAVE FEARED HAVE COME UPON ME!\" Many persons suffer from chronic anxiety, which is simply a subconscious mental expectancy that something terrible will happen to them. On the other hand, we all know people who seem to have the \"magic\" touch. Life seems to shower them with blessings for no apparent reason, and so we call them \"lucky\". What seems to be luck, in reality is POSITIVE MENTAL EXPECTANCY, a strong belief that they deserve to be successful. \"WE BECOME WHAT WE THINK ABOUT\". Our physical health is largely dependent upon our mental expectancy. Physicians recognize that if a patient expects to remain sick, lame, paralyzed, helpless, even to die, the expected condition tends to be realized. Here is where self-hypnosis can become the tool to remove despondence and negative attitudes and bring about a hopeful positive expectancy - - the expectancy of health, strength, and well being, which then tends to be realized. Rule Number Three: IMAGINATION IS MORE POWERFUL THAN KNOWLEDGE WHEN DEALING WITH YOUR OWN MIND OR THE MIND OF ANOTHER."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"28. Rules of the Mind This is an important rule to remember when using self-hypnosis. REASON IS EASILY OVERRULED BY IMAGINATION. This is why some persons blindly rush into some unreasonable act or situation. Violent crimes based upon jealousy are almost always caused by an overactive imagination. Most of us feel superior to those who lose their savings to con men, or blindly follow a demagogue such as Hitler, or are sold worthless stocks. We can easily see that such people have allowed their imagination to overcome their reason. But we are often blind to our own superstitions, prejudice and unreasonable beliefs. Any idea accompanied by a strong emotion such as anger, hatred, love, or our political and religious beliefs usually cannot be modified through the use of reason. In using self-hypnosis we can form images in the subconscious mind, which is the feeling mind, and can remove, alter or amend the old ideas. Rule Number four: ONCE AN IDEA THAT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND, IT REMAINS UNTIL IT IS REPLACED BY ANOTHER IDEA. THE COMPANION RULE TO THIS IS, THE LONGER THE IDEA REMAINS, THE MORE OPPOSITION THERE IS TO REPLACING IT WITH A NEW IDEA. Once an idea has been accepted, it tends to become a fixed habit of thinking. This is how habits of action are formed, both good and bad. First, there is the thought and then the action. We have habits of thinking as well as habits of action, but the thought or idea always comes first. Hence it is obvious that if we wish to change our actions we must begin by changing our thoughts. We accept as true certain facts. For example, we accept as true that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. We accept this even though the day may be cloudy and we cannot see the sun. This is an instance of a correct fact conception that governs our actions under normal conditions. However, we have many thought habits that are not correct and yet are fixed in the mind. Some people believe that at critical times they must have a drink of whiskey or a tranquilizer to steady their nerves so that they can perform effectively. This is not correct, but the idea is there and it is a fixed habit of thought. There will be opposition to replacing it with a correct idea. Now, in advancing these rules, we are speaking of fixed ideas, not just idle thoughts or passing fancies. We need to alter fixed ideas or to use them. No matter how fixed the ideas may be or how long they have remained, they can be changed using self-hypnosis and autosuggestion. Rule Number Five: EACH SUGGESTION ACTED UPON CREATES LESS OPPOSITION TO SUCCESSIVE SUGGESTION."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"29. Rules of the Mind A mental habit is easier to follow the longer it lasts unbroken. Once a habit is formed it becomes easier to follow and more difficult to break. In other words, once a self-suggestion has been accepted by your subconscious mind it becomes easier for additional suggestions to be accepted and acted upon. This is why, when you are just beginning with self-hypnosis and autosuggestion, we suggest you start with simple suggestions. You can suggest that you feel a tingling sensation or a warm and pleasant feeling. You should begin now with the suggestion that you will automatically emerge from self- hypnosis in ten minutes. Rule Number Six: AN EMOTIONALLY INDUCED SYMPTOM TENDS TO CAUSE ORGANIC CHANGE IF PERSISTED IN LONG ENOUGH. It has been acknowledged by many reputable medical men that more than seventy percent of human ailments are functional rather than organic. This means that the function of an organ or another part of the body has been disturbed by the reaction of the nervous system to negative ideas held in the subconscious mind. We do not mean to imply that every person who complains of an ailment is emotionally ill or neurotic. There are diseases caused by germs, parasites, virus and other things attacking the human body. However, we are a mind in a body and the two cannot be separated. Therefore, if you continue to fear ill health, constantly talk about your \"nervous stomach\" or \"tension headaches\", in time organic changes must occur. Rule Number Seven: WHEN DEALING WITH THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND AND IT'S FUNCTIONS, THE GREATER THE CONSCIOUS EFFORT, THE LESS THE SUBCONSCIOUS RESPONSE. This proves why \"Sill power\" doesn't really exist! If you have insomnia, you've learned \"the harder you try to go to sleep, the more wide awake you become\". The rule is, \"When dealing with the subconscious mind, TAKE IT EASY\". This means you must work to develop a positive mental expectancy that your problems can and will be solved. As your faith in your subconscious mind increases, you learn to \"let it happen\" rather than trying to \"force it to happen\"."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"30. Waking Hypnosis When hypnotic effects are achieved without the use of the relaxed state, such effects are called waking hypnosis. 1. It is summertime. You are extremely comfortable and enjoying the weather. Suddenly someone says, \"Wow! It's hot!\" In a moment or two, you notice that you are perspiring profusely. It doesn't occur to you that the suggestion precipitated \"waking hypnosis,\" which brought on the perspiration. 2. Every time a doctor gives or prescribes a placebo, he is using waking hypnosis. Waking Hypnosis Experiment In the presence of a number of people, crack open a perfectly fresh egg. Make a wry face and exclaim, \"Whew! This egg smells rotten. I wouldn't eat it for a thousand dollars.\" Now, pass the egg around. Let everyone smell it. Some of the people present will agree that the perfectly fresh egg has an offensive odor. Some may even say it looks bad. When you made the assertion, \"Whew! This egg smells rotten...\" You made a positive statement of apparent fact which your hearers accepted en toto. You bypassed their critical factors, substituting your own. Respect for your judgment caused them to believe what you said even before they smelled the egg, thus minimizing their ability to judge the egg fairly. Attaining Waking Hypnosis 1. The mind of the subject must lock itself around a given idea. 2. The suggestion must not be objectionable to the subject. Suggestions given in the waking state must be given with complete confidence and absolute assurance. They must leave no room for doubt. If doubt creeps in, the suggestion usually becomes ineffective. Therefore, give the suggestions in a manner that implies that what you have said is as certain of happening as the dawn. LEAVE NO ROOM FOR DOUBT!"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"31.

Dave Elman Induction Now, take a long deep breath and hold it for a few seconds. As you exhale this breath, allow your eyes to close and let go of the surface tension in your body. Just let your body relax as much as possible right now. Now, place your awareness on your eye muscles and relax the muscles around your eyes to the point they just won't work. When you're sure they're so relaxed that as long as you hold on to this relaxation, they just won't work, hold on to that relaxation and test them to make sure THEY WON'T WORK. (Allow 3 or 4 seconds to test then say) Stop testing. Now, this relaxation you have in your eyes is the same quality of relaxation that I want you to have throughout your whole body. So, just let this quality of relaxation flow through your whole body from the top of your head, to the tips of your toes. Now, we can deepen this relaxation much more. In a moment, I'm going to have you open and close your eyes. When you close your eyes that's your signal to let this feeling of relaxation become 10 times deeper. All you have to do is want it to happen and you can make it happen very easily. Ok, now, open your eyes...now close your eyes and feel that relaxation flowing through your entire body, taking you much deeper. Use your wonderful imagination and imagine your whole body is covered and wrapped in a warm blanket of relaxation. Now, we can deepen this relaxation much more. In a moment, I'm going to have you open and close your eyes one more time. Again, when you close your eyes, double the relaxation you now have. Make it become twice as deep.

In a moment, I'm going to lift your {right or left) hand by the wrist, just a few inches, and drop it. If you have followed my instructions up to this point, that hand will be so relaxed it will be just as loose and limp as a wet cloth, and will simply plop down. Now don't try to help me or you have to remove realization. Let me do all the lifting so that when I release it, it just plops down and you allow yourself to go much deeper. (If subject helps to lift hand say,) \"No, no let me do all the lifting, don't help me. Let it be heavy. Don't help me. You'll feel it when you have it.\" Now, that's complete physical relaxation. I want you to know that there are two ways a person can relax. You can relax physically and you can relax mentally. You already proved that you can relax physically, now let me show you how to relax mentally. In a moment, Til ask you to begin slowly counting backward, out loud, from 100. Now, here's the secret to mental relaxation, with each number you say, double your mental relaxation. With each number you say, let your mind become twice as relaxed. Now if you do this, by the time you reach the number 98, or maybe even sooner, your mind will have become so relaxed, you will have actually relaxed all the rest of the numbers that would have come after 98, right out of your mind, there just won't be any more numbers.

The Confusion Method Of Induction And Deepening Just close your eyes and let your mind drift to where it will. You are aware of everything, and yet, you are not aware. You are listening with your subconscious mind, while your conscious mind is resting and not listening. Your conscious mind drifts far away and is not listening. Your subconscious mind is alert, and listening, and hearing everything while your conscious mind remains relaxed and very peaceful. You can relax peacefully because your subconscious mind is taking charge, and when this happens, you close your eyes and let your subconscious mind do all the listening. Your subconscious mind knows, and because your subconscious mind knows, your conscious mind does not need to know and you can stay relaxed, and not mind while your subconscious mind stays alert. You have much potential in your subconscious mind which you don't have in your conscious mind. You can remember everything that has happened with your subconscious mind, but you cannot remember everything with your conscious mind. You can forget so easily, and with forgetting certain things, you can remember other things. Remembering what you need to remember, and forgetting what you can forget. It does not matter if you forget, you need not remember. Your subconscious mind remembers everything you need to know, and you can let your subconscious mind listen and remember while your conscious mind relaxes and forgets. Keep your eyes closed and listen with your subconscious mind, and when you're listening very, very carefully, nod your head and say \"yes.\" And as you continue to listen to me with your subconscious mind, your conscious mind relaxes deeper and deeper, and deeper and deeper. Let your conscious mind stay deeply relaxed, and let your subconscious mind listen to me. The basic message to this induction is conscious forgetting and subconscious knowing. This message is drawn out and repeated Separate directions for conscious mind, and separate directions for subconscious mind maintain the subconscious attention; while dismissing the conscious attention, both by the suggestions, the pauses and mental fatigue."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"36. The Shock - Confusion Method of Induction This method is especially effective with particularly difficult subjects, but is not practical when working with accountants, engineers, mathematicians, etc, because it would not be in keeping with their professions to be confused by figures. The subject is told to concentrate on a spot on the ceiling lightly above eye level. He is then instructed to count out loud, backwards, from one hundred to zero. As the subject concentrates on the spot and counts, the hypnotist standing directly behind him, converses with him; usually suggestion relaxation to various parts of the body. Eye fatigue, the concentration required to count and the distraction of the hypnotist's voice, all tend to confuse the subject. As the subject counts, he may find himself omitting numbers as follows. \"87...86...85...83...81,\" or repeating numbers \"87... 86...85...85.\" He may suffer long pauses as he tries to remember the last figure he quoted. The hypnotist listens for symptoms of confusion and the moment he detects it, he claps his hands loudly and commands his subject to \"SLEEP!\" The hand clap and command have a very shocking effect on the subject who immediately stops counting and goes into a deep state of trance. If the count goes on too long without the generation of confusion, the hypnotist may help the situation by randomly uttering numbers. It is very important that after the \"SLEEP!\" command is given that the hypnotist keeps up his patter (talking). Deepening suggestions are recommended. A period of silence right after trance is obtained will cause the subject to emerge. Continue with deepening techniques."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"37. The Analytical Subject Sometimes, no matter what kind of an induction you attempt, if the subject does not respond it is probably that they have discovered a fear. Remove the fear, then bring your hand to within several inches of the subjects eyes and begin moving your hand up and down while saying the following words: \"Follow my hand up and down, up and down and, as you do, your eyes will become heavier and heavier, up and down.\" (This is repeated for about two minutes.) If the eyes do not close the subject is told, \"Now you can close them.\" (At the same time, the fingers of the operator press the eyelids down lightly.) Proceed with deepening technique Thumb And Finger Technique Instruct the subject to look at your thumb and index finger which are brought close to the eyes and separated to correspond with the space between the eyes and say: \"Your eyes are getting very heavy and tired continue to look at my fingers. I am going to bring them closer and closer to your eyes, and as I do, they will shut.\" (Move your fingers very slowly toward the subjects eyes with continued suggestions of feelings of tiredness and heaviness.) The client will, of course, be unable to resist closing his eyes as the fingers approach them. The operator may then gently press on the eyelids remarking that they are stuck together and they will remain shut until the subject is instructed to open them.

Suggest, \"Until I again touch you on the shoulder, you will continue to go deeper and deeper relaxed. You will pay no attention to my voice.\" Do not leave the subject alone longer than 15 or 20 minutes, for some subjects tend to come out of hypnosis on their own or lapse into a normal sleep. 2. EXHALING... Suggest, \"Each time you exhale, you will automatically sink deeper.\" / usually combine this suggestion with a period of silence. 3. COUNTING... Counting up or counting down from any number, i.e., 10-1. I prefer to count down because it lends to the feeling of sinking deeper. 4. HALLUCINATIONS. . .Walking steps, riding in a car or train, sailing, going in a tunnel or down a corridor, sliding, etc. Combine counting with hallucinations adds to the effect, i.e., riding down an elevator, going down one floor with each count. 5. IDEO-MOTOR SUGGESTIONS.. .Eye catalepsy, arm catalepsy, etc. 6. IDEO-SENSORY SUGGESTIONS. . .Hot and cold sensations, and those affecting the senses, sound, touch, smell and taste. 7. PYRAMIDING. . .Repeated inductions without awakening. 8. FRACTIONATION. . hypnotizing, de-hypnotizing and re-hypnotizing several times. 9. INDIRECT SUGGESTIONS. . .While the subject is hypnotized, direct your suggestions to someone else. Explain what is happening and what is going to happen. Thus, the subject indirectly receives the suggestions. 10. FEEDBACK... Sensations which the subject feels are fed back to him. 11. PLACEBO... Pill, drink, Harmless certain procedures, which the subject believes will affect him. 12. COMPOUNDING SUGGESTIONS... Suggest that every move they make and every suggestion you give sends them deeper relaxed. 13. POST-HYPNOTTC SUGGESTIONS... To respond to a signal, to go deeper each time they are hypnotized, etc. 14. REALIZATION... Bringing it to their attention that the effect is working and that they are responding."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"39.

As I stroke your arm, counting from one to five as I do so, you'll find your arm becoming more and more rigid.

Fractionation Fractionation is one of the most effective of all deepening techniques. It is especially effective after the use of an instant or rapid induction. Fractionation involves interrupting the trance and \"emerging\" the client several times during a single session. This \"emerging\", having the client open his eyes without using an emerging technique, and re-hypnotizing tends to effectively lessen a subject's inhibitions and, therefore, deepens the trance with each successive induction. With this procedure, the client actually remains in hypnosis even though his eyes are open, as there has been no procedure by the hypnotist to emerge the client from trance. The count can be a valuable adjunct to fractionation. The client first is counted down from ten to zero and, at the count of zero, is instructed to let his body \"\"waken\"\"as the hypnotist counts from one to fifteen. He is told to open his eyes at the count of ten, and at the count of fifteen his eyes will go heavy and close and he will go deeply relaxed again, as the hypnotist counts back again from fifteen to zero. The count of fifteen serves as a post-hypnotic cue for \"sleep.\" This suggestion is reinforced by the command \"SLEEP!\" given simultaneously with the number fifteen. The double cue (count and command) is a difficult combination to resist. In a very short time, the subject who has found it difficult to accept his own hypnotizability becomes convinced by his own spontaneous responses to cues. Once acceptance is established, he is well on the way to becoming a cooperative and successful client."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"42.

Now, close your eyes. You can relax better with your eyes closed, for your whole body has been use to relaxing in sleep since the day you were born...but this time you're not going to sleep, your just going to relax. Now let's pay some attention to those muscles around your eyes. Relax the muscles around the eyes first. Start with your eyelids. Relax the muscles controlling those eyelids to the point where they feel so loose and limp and relaxed that as long as you hold on to that quality of relaxation, they just won't work. Now when you're sure that you have gotten them to the point where they just won't work, try to make them work. If you're really relaxed, they just won't work at all. If you want them to work, all you have to do is stop relaxing the eyelid muscles and your eyes will pop open. Get ready to try it. Now tense your eyes and watch them pop right open. See, that's all there is to it. Now, you know you can make those eyelid muscles work or not work depending on how relaxed your muscles are, so let's try it again and this time relax even more than you did before. Ok, let's start. Close your eyes. Relax the muscles so deeply that they just wont work. (Pause) Now send that relaxation all through your body. Let it go down to your very toes. Are you doing it? Because if you are, you begin to feel as if your whole body is being covered and protected by a blanket of relaxation. Now, let that feeling cover you completely. Now, we can deepen that relaxation tremendously, all we have to do is start with the relaxation you now have, and when I tell you to, and not before, open and close your eyes, and when they close this time, you'll find yourself relaxed at least five times as much as you've relaxed up to this very minute. Get ready to try it. Now stay completely relaxed in all your muscles except the muscles around the eyes. Now make your eyelids work by tensing them. Open them, now close them. Now feel how the depth of relaxation increases as you relax your eyelid muscles again. Now once again, send that feeling of relaxation right down to your toes. You'll feel so relaxed, and you'll start feeling so good. You're just covered in a complete blanket of relaxation. Now we can even deepen this relaxation more.

You've proven that you can relax physically, now let's relax mentally. Here is how. In a moment I want you to start counting backwards from 100 with me silently in your mind with the idea that you are going to relax the numbers right out of your mind. In other words, you're going to dispel those numbers by commanding your mind to relax as you count. Now, in a moment, I want you to start from 100 and count back with me mentally so that when you get to 98, you'll find that all of a sudden, all the numbers after 98 will have completely disappeared. Now, say the first number with me silently and relax as you do so. (100) That's right, now relax completely and when the next number comes up they'll begin to fade if you order them to be dispelled from your mind. (99) Now get rid of those numbers. Just say to yourself, they must disappear. And as you relax mentally, they will disappear and you'll feel a surge of relaxation. Now say the last number (98). Now they'll be gone. You just can't find any numbers anywhere. Now this is what's known as complete physical and mental relaxation. If for any reason the numbers have not yet disappeared, don't worry, they'll leave as I continue to talk with you.

Explain that he feels free of any fear of any which he has to leave, because he knows that he can deal with those later. \"Now Mr. Client, notice that the white bits....the good, positive, energizing, helpful thought and emotional energies and feelings are expanding...growing to fill all the space left by the red ones you disposed of....growing, expanding!....until they fill the whole walls and ceiling with beautiful, wonderful, positive, white!

Your muscles become instantly calm, very deeply relaxed and you allow the sound of my voice to guide you deeper into relaxation. Following my suggestions guides you deeper into relaxation. The deeper you go into relaxation the better you feel, and the better you feel the more and more your body relaxes with just wonderful feelings going through your body and happy thoughts going through your mind. So relax, and let yourself go. Now I want you to relax still more to a deeper state of relaxation. Much more relaxed. So again I'll count from five down to one and as I count from five down to one, your body will double the relaxation you have right now, automatically. 5...Relaxation starting to double. 4...Relaxation doubling more and more. 3...Very comfortable very relaxed. 2...Relaxation is now almost doubled in your body. 1...Relaxation now has doubled in your body from the top of your head to the tips of your toes. Every fiber, every tissue, every organ, every gland every part of you has doubled in its relaxation. You feel fine. I want you to imagine, or visualize, in front of you is a long staircase that is leading down into relaxation. We have never found a basement, a bottom of a person's ability to relax. It's endless. Every breath that you exhale takes you down another step on this staircase of relaxation. Every breath takes you deeper into an endless state of relaxation. You drift down feeling wonderful, feeling comfortable. Relax and let yourself go. Just relax and let yourself go. I still want you to relax to a much more relaxed state. Already with your light switch in the off position, every muscle becomes dormant, quite unable to move. Again I will count, but this time from ten down to one. As I count from ten down to one, your conscious mind will relax as much as your body is relaxed and your mind and body will double the relaxation that it has at that time on each and every count. 10...Your mind is as relaxed as the body is relaxed and the body is doubling it's relaxation. 9...The mind is relaxed as the body is relaxed, and the body is doubling it's relaxation again. 8...Mind relaxed as the body is relaxed and the body again is doubling the relaxation it has at this time. 7...The same thing. 6...Keep right on going now."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"48. Self Hypnosis Deepening Standard Version 5...4...3...2...1...Mind relaxed as the body is relaxed and your body has doubled its relaxation many times over. By relaxation I mean the absence of all contractions. Your body is loose, limp and motionless. Your muscles offering no resistance just as if you were a rag doll. Complete relaxation means the absence of all movement. It means the complete absence of holding any part of your body rigid. So as you are completely relaxed, all the muscles attached to your bones are limp. If you make any voluntary movements you can only do so by contracting some group of muscles, but when you allow these muscles to become completely dormant, your nerves are completely inactive. And its certain that complete relaxation in any set of nerves simply means zero activity in these nerves. And it is physically impossible for you to be nervous in any part of your body. You're feeling better than you've felt in a long time. Outside noises will not distract you. Anything you may hear will only assist you in relaxing more and more deeply and you do go deeper. With every breath, down another step on that endless staircase of relaxation. The sound of my voice keeps guiding you deeper into relaxation. Following my suggestions keeps guiding you into deeper relaxation. And the more and more you allow your body to relax the better you feel and the better you feel the more your mind and body will relax. You have complete control over every nerve in your body, control over your whole nervous system, and you drift much deeper, much deeper into relaxation. And now there is only three more levels of relaxation for you to go into now. Level A, level B and level C. Now to accomplish these levels, you must know it will work, let it work. You can feel it working, feel it working as if you are going down an escalator to deeper levels at all times. So now I want you to go from where you are to level A, ten times deeper. You know it will work, let it work. Feel it working, feel yourself sinking down to level A as if you're going down an escalator. Very good. Now I want you to go from level A to level B. Again you know it will work, let it work. Feel it work as if you're going down an escalator from level A to level B, ten times deeper, automatically going down. Very good. Now I want you to go from level B to level C, your basement of relaxation today. You know it will work, let it work. Feel it work. Feel yourself sinking down many times deeper to level C.

Coma State Testing There are three (3) tests to determine if the client is in the coma state. All tests should be given without mentioning them to the client. Just do them! Test 1. Since the coma state produces an automatic state of anesthesia within the client, test for anesthesia. A firm pinch on the wrist or arm will suffice. Test 2. Check for physical catalepsy. Lift the arms and legs up and release them. They should effortlessly remain in that position until you lower them. When the arm or leg is in the position you choose, a slight jerk may be needed to let the subconscious mind know that it's where you want it to remain. Test 3. A startling command. Get in a position where you can see the client's eyes and say in a loud, sharp voice, \"Open your eyes!\" If there is absolutely no movement of the eyes in response to this command and they have successfully passed the other two tests, you can safely be assured that they are in the coma state. Remember, when the client is in the coma state he is still subject to the physical limitations of a non-hypnotized person.

Instant & Rapid Inductions The use of instantaneous and rapid inductions in your practice will enhance your practice and can eliminate many of the induction problems that come up with certain clients. Some of the problems that can be eliminated are: 1. None of your tired late afternoon or evening clients will go to sleep on you, as frequently happens when using a progressive relaxation induction. 2. Testing is built into many of the inductions; thus, creating an awareness by your client that he is indeed in hypnosis. This eliminates the \"I don't think I was hypnotized\" syndrome. 3. You will have more time for actual transformational therapy. If you only use 1 minute or less on the induction, instead of 15-30 minutes, your client will benefit greatly from the increased therapy time. The two most important preliminary steps for a successful induction are: 1. Enhance the clients imagination. 2. Create mental expectancy. Remember: What the mind expects to happen tends to be realized. Build the client's mental expectancy and the instant induction will work every time! Remember: Hypnosis is simply the bypass of the critical factor of the conscious mind and the establishment of acceptable selective thinking. The Two Parts of the Instant Induction 1. Create a rapid unexpected movement of some part or all of the client's body. This creates the bypass of the critical factor by overloading the nervous system. 2. Fire in the suggestion, \"Sleep!\" As the client's energy level drops down, he drops into trance. 3. Immediately say to the client, \"I've got you. Let every muscle go loose, limp and relaxed.\" Caution! If you are doing the induction with the client in the standing position, tell the client before you start, he will be able to stand and sleep. Be certain your body is in the proper balance position in order to support your client should his legs give out. If the client begins to fall say, \"Your legs are firm beneath you and you can stand and sleep.\""},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"61. Regression Regression, Hypnotic: causing a hypnotized person to mentally relive past experiences; to mentally \"return\" to an earlier time and/or place. Generally speaking, hypnotic regression is done for one of two purposes: 1. As a method of finding and revealing initial sensitizing (causal) events, subsequent sensitizing events, etc. 2. Recreationally, for people who wish to relive events of their past purely for reasons of pleasure, curiosity or self-satisfaction. However, in cases of argument or litigation between parties or in law enforcement, regression is sometimes used to allow a client to remember pertinent facts and details relevant to the dispute or case which s/he has been unable to CONSCIOUSLY recall. Great care must be exercised by the hypnotist to assure that he does not \"lead\" the client's subconscious. Some regression, with accurate memory and detail, can be achieved in the \"hypnoidal,\" or lighter, stages of hypnosis. In these stages, the client's account of remembered events are likely to be in the past tense. Perhaps more convincing regressions are achieved in deeper levels such as somnambulism, where the client's accounts are likely to be in the present tense. Statements are likely to begin with \"I am,\" or \"I have,\" instead of \"I was,\" or \"I had.\" Often, in these stages, the client's voice, speech and mannerisms will become as they were at whatever age they have regressed to. In any regression where the information to be gathered is important to the success of therapy, or to some dispute, some form of depth testing is probably desirable to satisfy yourself of an adequate level of hypnosis, the client's motive, general attitude and state of mind should be considered as part of your determination of the accuracy of the revealed data. Some Signs To Look For In Determining True Regression: Negative signs - Facial expressions denoting conscious attempts at memory, or clear articulation, upon being questioned. No change in respiration rate when recounting exciting details. No tears with sad details. No visible reaction to frightening incidents. No obvious happiness in good incidents. Positive signs - NO visible appearance of trying to \"think up\" answers or events. Quickening respiration rate when recounting exciting events. Tears, or obvious sadness when recounting sad events. Obvious physical and emotional reactions to any emotional incidents, good or bad. Important Miscellaneous: For many years, the tremendous potential of hypnosis has been overlooked by many people due to its simplicity. Psychology has taught us to look for some deeply hidden, abstract, complicated,"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"62. Regression entwined, confusing multi-faceted reasons for each disturbing discomfort in the psyche. Most of the time it's not that complicated! Because of all the publicity given to psychology in recent decades (as opposed to parapsychology), resulting in indoctrination, we find it difficult to set aside our often futile attempts at successful conscious level solutions. Working with the conscious rationale to effect change of an EMOTIONAL CONFLICT (an imbalance of thought and emotional energies) between the past stored in our subconscious and our present conscious level of the being that we are. As long as we are using to conscious level rationale in an attempt to solve our problem, we are deliberately keeping the conscious mind in control, in a position of critical, analytical thought Therefore, we have no good access to the source of the problem in the subconscious! Regression is quite simple to do. In what we have termed \"ethical practice\", there is inevitable overlapping of the various named components of the hypnosis session. As you know, \"pre-talk\" is a part of a successful induction, and induction begins with a pre-talk. When regression is done as a part of any transformational approach, the regression becomes not only an analysis technique, but is an important part of the transformation. Reliving an initial sensitizing event is a form of venting, with some appropriate \"control\" suggestions during the abreaction; plus, some perception correcting suggestions concerning the event, during and immediately after the abreaction(s). The ability of such an event from the past to negatively affect the client now or in the future, is neutralized. Thus, in many cases the therapy is completed in the analysis! The post-hypnotic \"control\" suggestions, and the pre-emerging suggestions, should always be completely positive, and of a nature to inspire happy anticipation; thus, they become part of the therapy. Once the client is hypnotized, the regression is achieved by the simple technique of suggesting to the client that it will happen. However, remember that you do not want this person to have any need to make any analytical decisions. Therefore, your suggestions must be so complete and simple in detail that the subject can allow it to happen without bringing the conscious mind into play in deciding HOW to do what you have suggested. The most difficult part of hypnotism in achieving results is thinking! In pre-talk, listening and observing to enable you to make a proper determination of the best induction technique to use with a particular client and then using it! In other words your induction!"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"63.

On your right, there are doors...evenly spaced...all the way to the end. Each of these doors is numbered...and each number represents a year of your life...your age in each succeeding year. You look to your right and find that you are standing in front of a door marked with your present age, right now. The next door is marked one year younger, the next, one year younger; and so it goes...a door for every year of your life, all the way to the end of the hall.\" \"At the count of one, I want you to begin walking rather slowly, down the hall, looking at every door as you go by, aware that behind each door is a room representing that particular year of your life, and containing all of the stored memories...good and bad...from that year; all filed away so that they will only be seen when we choose to see them. When you come to a door at which you feel some need, desire, or inclination to stop,....stop and signal me by extending the index finger of your right {or left) hand.\" \"At the count of one, begin walking down the hall.\" Each count on client's exhale. \"Three, two, one!\" Now, sit patiently and quietly and watch for the signal! Each client moves at his or her own pace, so WAIT! If you find yourself waiting more than about four or five minutes by the clock; it will seem like a long time, ask, \"Where are you now?\" Client: \"Fifteen.\" A slow walker! Hypnotist: \"No doors, yet, where you felt any need or desire to stop?\" Client: \"No.\" Hypnotist: \"All right, go on down the hall. Check out the rest of the doors. If you should reach the end of the hall before finding a stopping place, use the same signal as you would in front of the door.\" Wait, again. When the client gives you the proper signal, ask, \"Where are you now?\" Client: \"Six.\" Hypnotist: \"At the count of one, open the door marked six and step into the room, closing the door behind you. You will find yourself in a fairly large, square room, with bare, white walls. The only thing you will see in the room is that right in the middle of the floor there is a pedestal, about waist high, which has two buttons on top of it; one green, and one red. Walk over to the pedestal and stop, and then signal me as you did when you stopped in the hall.\" \"Three, two, one! Go in, shut the door behind you, and walk over to the pedestal. Signal when you are there .\" After signal... \"Now, at the count of one, reach out and push the green button. When you do, some event or incident of importance from that year will appear on the wall opposite the door where you came in, or will appear as a memory in your mind. Either way is ok. Whenever WE feel that WE need to stop this event, YOU can push the red button, and it will quickly disappear.

The subconscious \"feels \" why you 're here, and its earlier attempts to reveal and vent what it has stored here are largely responsible for your client's complaints. Trust this fact: When this client reveals to you whatever comes at this time, it IS all or part of what you 're looking for! In every case, it will be relevant and important It might be rape, incest, rejection, death of a loved one, separation, some accident, an illness, a childhood quarrel; almost any emotionally traumatic event, but whatever it is, when revealed in this manner, it is important to the therapy for this client! You can trust this to be true. But suppose the client gets all the way to the end of the hall before signaling you? Well, first, this will rarely happen, but it DOES occur occasionally. It indicates one of four things, in my experience: 1. The client didn't get your directions straight Think! Did you make your suggestion clear enough for the subconscious? 2. The client is not, at least at this time, \"hypnotized.\" Discuss it with him. It may be that he was simply so interested and afraid of \"missing\" something that he refused to relax and disassociate. You need to learn more about classifying and testing clients! 3. On RARE occasions: This client's I.S.E. occurred prior to birth, and there are no significant S.S.E. 's. Re-induce or deepen as indicated. Put another door marked \"womb\" at the very end of the hall, have him enter the peaceful, welcoming warm and restful darkness of this room; re-entering his mother's womb and say, \"Feel the peace and safety. Hear mother's heart beat. Sense yourself becoming younger and smaller, as a fetus, until the moment of your conception. Tell me any time you feel any unpleasant feelings.\" 4. The client should be returned from conception, growing to full term fetus, feeling mother's contractions, experiencing his birth, and then returned through the hall to today, when he's ready to come back."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"67.
