With this course, you will learn the remote infl uence thought and through it create your reality. We are about to embark on a stup endous journey - a journey through the wonders of your inner mind - the inner magical world of your self. This course, in its entirety, is about you. You will discover your infinite power. Your power to change and affect your entire world. To influence your life, as well as others', for the better. This power, your birthright, a waits within you. It has nothi ng to do with money, social status, or education. It is the power of ma nifesting your thoughts. It is an inner force that all of you possess, which will apply its infinite power to accommodate and project to you the world that you desire, the reality that you trul y envision with dedicated mental imaginative concentration. Since th is world/Matrix has managed to trap you and convince you of the idea of scarcity and limitations, you will be taught to go beyond th e linear restrictions that you currently believe in. You are the most important part of your Creation. You, the corp orate executive, construction worker, student, child, nurse, retire d person, artist, doctor, taxi driver , scientist, politician, etc., are equally important, not only to your self, but also to this shared dream we call our world. As you watch the world around you, many of you think it is irremediably flawed. Many of you have not realized that it need not be so. We each have a choice, along with the ultimate power of Creation, which is to Create. The power to manifest thoughts and remote influen ce reality is within us, as is the power to de-energize old memories, thought patterns and habits. Untapped within you, until now, is your power to reprogram new realities, new vistas, and new dreams for our world. You are as much the sons and daughters of God as being God: the One Himsel f. No matter what is your biological gender - Men and Women alike. Throughout this course, the masculine term is used for all forms of Creative thought - for they metaphorically express within the Inner high Creative realms, the desire to expand and project one's creative seed within the warm nurturing element that the feminine aspect represents as the carrier of life, and all of its manifestations. The masculine aspect represents the expansive, creative element of lif e: The Yang energy, while the feminine aspect represents contraction, the housing for the Yang energy, nurtu ring, loving and structuring. The feminine aspect being Mother Nature, and Huma nkind the masculine creative aspect, men and women alike. You are all parts of the One. The son, as you, is but the manifestation of the Father, as your subconscious Highest Self, who will manifest to you the reality that you have highly energized and believed in through the housing that the Mother, mani festing and vibrating matter, will permit within her operational rules. You all originate from the ultimate energy. And as such you maintain and carry the characteristics of the One Mind, the One Self, which is the power to affect reality through thought and its manifestation when it ble nds with high energy. The son, as the manifestat ion of thought that you experience is the Father. The Father as your COPYRIGHT © 2002 Gerald O'Donnell."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course deepest subconscious thought (the Over Self) will beco me the son as the manifestation of it, which is what is then experienced by you as your reality. What you believe within, at the level of your subconscious mind, is what you are, what you project , and what you experience. What you are is what you manifest. What within, so without. Nevertheless, what without is not what is necessarily within. You do not necessarily consciously think what you experience without. The son is not the entire Father, in perception. Not yet. He is not the Over Self yet. However, they were, are and will always remain but one. For the conscious slow linear critical mind does not necessarily realize that it is creating its whole world, by the thoughts that it carries at the level of the highly energized s ubconscious thought realm of the Father. The Father as the Creator is the Son as the Cr eated and Creation. The Fa ther expresses Himself through the Son. He begets the son and the world that the son is surrounded w ith. For that, the Father enters the feminine subconscious aspect of Mother Nature, who vibrates and keeps the Vibratory light programming of matter. In that crea tive act, Mother Nature then gives birth to the projected reality of the son. You are all the Father 's active sons: Men and women alike-you are the active parts. What you think is what the Father projects to you who are He. Fi rst, you as the son thinks, and then the Father as your subconsciou s Over Self projects the thoughts that you are absolutely convinced of, the thoughts that you entertain without any feeling of doubt, with blind faith. These thoughts become part of the thought processes of the Father , within your deep subcons cious, which are then immediately made creative, energized, projected a nd manifested by the Father for you to experience and act within that expe rience. However, the son also influe nces the Father by his thoughts. You influence the One. This is how the One needs to crea te. For if the One were to be projecting realities from thought processes that He, as the One, ha s about Creation, about the way Creation needs to operate, all He would be doing would be projecting a paradisiacal world. For He knows at his level that the son is only Him. He experiences it. And He theref ore cares. He constantly cares for and loves all of His sons. For He perceives all of them to be Himself. And that constant paradi se, were the Father would constantly influence the thoughts of the sons and ther efore influence reality would but be a garden of Eden going on for infinity, with no possible learning, nor source for surp rise. Devoid of free will for the sons as His Manifestation as human beings. Therefore, The Father has restricted Himself by forc ing Himself to be subject to His Sons' desires, His Sons' thoughts and by almost alwa ys projecting to his sons the reality which they dream about. He has given them, who are but Himself, free will. He has allowed them to make free choices within a potential infinity of choices. The Father has therefore al so created potential hell. There is no hell outside of Created hell. Created by us who are Him within Creation, within our created world. The feedback to our actions is right here within the universe— from within. The One cannot be in hell within the notion of One. Only through the separation of Himself into the many perceived separations as human beings can He restrict Himself into having a hellish experience. A hellish experience that can always be avoi ded if we were to understand and a pply the key to Creation-- the key to "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course manifestation— if we were to understand the key to Remote influencing Thought and through it reality. This is the way of Creation. The key is to always see Reality and things as flowing and operating from the One as the Father onto you, th e many, as His manifestations. Not reversed. To understand that all of you \"is\" still the One. Because at the deepest level of your self you are the IS: The One only Being. The multiplicity of beings onl y exist within the Imagination of the One. Nevertheless, all of the Sons, as conscious linear thought processes within the illusion of space/time, are the Father who is the One. Not \"are\" the Father . The many \"is\" still One. And is still the One. The Son is the expression of the Father, the manifestation of it. If the conscious mind (as it watches life and its perceived outsi de world) thinks and becomes convinced with blind faith of something, the Father (as the collective inner subconsci ous realm) will manifest and project that reality to the son (who is but the projection of th e Father within the realm of Creation). Nevertheless, the son rules over th e Father by the power of his beliefs—the pow er of blind faith. The outside world does not influence the Father as the source of manifestation. It only influences us. It tests us and is part of our learni ng and evolutionary process. It infl uences us by projecting to us the concepts that we believe in about ourselves and our reality. The outside re ality influences us by continuing to operate often within undesirable path s that we inherit and/or develop due to our individual memories and/or coll ective ones. And these undesirable paths may be yours unless you care enough about the path of Creation by being willing to try to remote influence the Father, who is the source of manifestation. Therefore, claiming your birthr ight as Humankind. Listen to me well, you all can and should do this. Every single human entity that lives, lived and will ever live is given this power, by the original inte nt and law of the Father who is your inner deepest subconscious Self: your Over Self. You hold within yourself the power to save yourself and all of your world. No matter who you are; just by the power of thought. You can and should be the savior of your Creation. All of you have been give n the power to influence the Fath er. This is the real power of Creation, the real power of free will, the power given to all without exception. From the time you open your eyes at birth, until you close th em at death. This power is the pow er of love, of care, about your reality and your world. All of it. For you can influence all of it only by your thought, as far as you can possibly conceive of it. This power has no boundaries and will accept none, for al l beings are parts of the One. This power easily transcends space and time, fo r it originates outside of it. It originates from within, from within the realm of energized thought, within your subconscious self, within your collective self that you can and should religious ly explore and reclaim. The majority of books about positive thinking have only scratched the surface of this deep truth and reality. The Godliness said as He defines Himself, \"I am th at I am:\" \"I am As the Father, that I am, as the son, as the projected reality and projection.\" The s on, as yourself, needs to understand that you, as the son experiencing the projected reality of your world, is but the Father, as the subconscious Over Self that operates for now below the threshold of your cons cious awareness. You need to become aware that the Father, as your higher subconscious realm, project s to you that very reality based on beliefs that you input within your subconscious belief system. And you, as the "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course son, need to realize that you the son and the Father are but One: The One. So that, as this realization is made yours, the subconscious realm will slowly become part of your conscious awareness and translate into an awareness of being the Total Self— The One Himself—the level of pure unrestricted thought. And then, the key to being the Father or the Ki ng will be yours, and you will Create, with the full power of the One, the reality of a world for whic h you will then care very mu ch about, for it will be your Creation. Your world, created by you, with full pe rception and participation. A new Garden of Eden, a witness to your ultimate realization, that you will cherish and keep wa tering with your careful thoughts. For the emphasis should be that you are but the One Himself, restricting Himself into believing that He is many. And then you will operate unde r the old Divine rule of, \"I will be that I will be.\" Which means anything you believe that you are, will ev entually be projected to you-as the One, by The One. For it is the birthright of the King as the son to be given back the Kingdom as the Father, as the realization that you always were an d are an expression of the Father, of the Absolute Only Reality. That you and the Father are and were always One, not two, although you perceive your selves as being separate. It is for you to become aware that the door to the Kingdom was always ready to be unlocked, that the key was and is within you. The bad news being that the son, as you, had forgotten about the Kingdom and the fact that you were and are it. Thinking, mistakenly, an d being fed the thought that if it existed at all, it was not part of your dominion, of your birthright. And that only high begotten souls or elected ones could reach this open inner door, due to their merit, travail, or perceived multiple incarnations. The One is the only one really reincarnating. Period. The many do not. Learn to see things from the One to the many, not reverse, ev en though you find yourself at the perception of the many. Understand you are all the One. And as such, you always go back ultimately to the One. Certain specific memory banks can be reenergized and pr ojected again in Creati on, but is it always, nevertheless, the One that is reincarnating unde r the costume of these past preprogrammed characteristics. The many can unify their thoughts wh ile they operat e in Creation as the pe rceived many and create a reality full of joy, laughter, and unlimited resour ces. They can express a r eality of unification and peace by carrying the notion and understanding of the One, and hence experience a reality of limitless empowerment of the individual for all of his or her reality, all of his or her world—the world of the One— that the subconscious One projects and Dr eams for the many. And ther efore regain the new Garden, the new Paradise, here on this magnificen t planet of ours, our home: Earth. Not in some spiritual realm, neither in space. Created and main tained, by your thoughts, your desires. The challenge is here and both the reward and the punishment is here and now. Not there and then. The key to the One is to learn and understand that all you need to do is influence It by learning to be It—to become It. To realize that It is, was and will always be you. To become all of you, all of your higher Self. This is the is real rapture that the script ures predict when the realization of being the Kingdom and having the Kingly powers is here and now, understood by all, an d a new beautiful Matrix/reality is to be experienced by all of you, as manifestations of the One. In this course, you will learn and understand that you need to religiously monitor and learn to influence your subconscious r ealm: the Inner Kingdom, and"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course approach with full awareness this abode of the One infinite power: the Father of it all. And hence, reintegrate the awareness of being the One and only Creator, who is you , as the totality of you. In this course, we will teach you how to access this unlim ited power, and love yourself and all of your Creation. For in doing so and caring enough about it, you will change all of it; you will save all of it. You will use the high and unlimited power of Creative ab ility that you have been given as a birthright as the son; you will learn to e xplore the real Kingdom, which is th e inner Kingdom of the One: the inner Kingdom of the Self. Who you all are, with no exception. Nevertheless, I can hear many of you saying that this notion is ri diculous. That you can barely manage and handle your immediate world. That you certa inly cannot be made responsible for the ills of this world. You are aware of them, but refuse to accep t responsibilities for the world at large that you have inherited and are witnessing. You can only and will only take care of your neck of the woods- your family; maybe your community, and leave the rest of reality to others to handle and/or bother with. You proclaim that the ro ot of evil is outside of you, be yond you, and certainly cannot be overcome and handled by you. That you will leave others or some ultimate higher force to address it; that although you care, you cannot ha ndle and dispose of all of it. Well, dear friends, \"the Kingdom of Heaven is within:\" Heaven being the realm of the deep subconscious. Let me repeat this. Re peat it to yourself constantly until you integrate this absolute Truth, this key to salvation. Meditate on this. Make it a mantra. The Kingdom is within, not without, and at the highest level of yourself you are the King. Th e ultimate reality: the One Himself, a level of pure unlimited thought. You have the ultimate power. All of you. do. The power of the One. The power to energize and manifest thoughts into reality. The power to remote influence events, individuals or a group, no matter how perceptually big and distant they are. There is no real reason for evil to be perceived as being outside of us, fo r it is not. As part of the Kingdom , it is within. In this world of duality, both good intentions and bad ones are all within. Not without. I see you coming. \"Hold on!\" you scream, \"are you now going to imply that I am also evil? That there are no external purposely create d dark forces that die to enslave us, to rob us of our enlightenment into the Divine realm?\" Of course they exist. They are but your thoughts as an individual self, and the collective sum of the tho ughts you agree upon and manifest collectivel y. It is only y ou who can change you. No one else can, nor will do it for you. It never happened before, and it never will. You can only be shown the way, given a message; it is up to you to walk the path and listen. The message is the essence. The messenger is irreleva nt. It is but the One Himself. And so are you. We are all the experience, the test tube. The One, at the level of the One, is not the experience. He is the solution, the answer, to making the experience a successful one. You know, not so many years ago, the idea of an active subconscious realm was a very questioned notion. It is only with the advent of modern psyc hological research, the recen t interest in so-called mystical knowledge of old, and especi ally the advances in scientific bi ological research that we have all come to accept the reality of an extremely intellig ent subconscious realm. Subconscious because it operates below our waking awareness. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course We all know, for instance, from cellular DNA research, that each cell within our biology has millions of extremely complex coordinated parallel ope rations that occur each second of our lives. The subconscious is widely held responsible for this in credible creative act of life sustenance. During every moment of our lives and for the totality of it, it regulates and triggers trillions of extremely complex parallel actions that it all carefully monitors for a pproximately 82 trillions of very specialized cells that form our biological embodiment. None of us are really co nscious of the extraordinary effort of high intelligence and precise decision making that is required to keep ea ch and every individual alive a si ngle moment more. Were we to become aware of it, we would be in a state of cons tant and infinite awe at the level of parallel thought processing required and achieved. Our ego often prevents such an awareness to disturb our comfortable sense of superiority and isolation. This is why we are so highly insistent on trying to put a physical location to our subconscious proce sses, life program, fate and cont rol over it. We want to be the individualized carrier a nd lone manifestation of ourselves. We ll let me reassure you. There is good news on the horizon. Not only are you the lone carrier of the information code that makes you, not only can your thoughts affect your biologi cal being and health through subconscious pro cesses, but you also carry the fate of your universe within you. Your thoughts define the type of universes you experience within the infinite, possi ble, probable futures of the Father: the permanent quantum soup. Not only do you remote influence your subconscious processes relating to your health, but you wi ll soon discover you remo te influence all of your reality, including the thought of others. You carry your subconscious realm, which is the One Father within yourself- the one coll ective unconscious of all Creations. All of it. Each and every one of you. You are conscious individual extens ions of Him. Soon we will kn ow and realize that we are all parts of a subconscious realm that does much more than just regul ate biological processes, for it projects all of reality. It projects within the biological realm a ll biological embodiments, and without it, the perceptual world of matter and energy, using th e loving embodiment of the Mother of it all— the real feminine nurturing aspect—Mot her Nature, who carries all of Cr eation inside of Her womb and manifests it for Her progeny: Humankind and nature alike. You will soon integrate the fact th at our slow-paced restricted lin ear thinking processes, operating within time and space, are but very limited expre ssions of many possible forms of thought. That thought need not be at all linear and certainly is not so at the level of your subc onscious, the level of the Kingdom. All of our world is but a dance of energies. Your material biologica l body is but a holographic expression of light created within an invisible Matrix of subtle ener gy that is as of yet unknown to science and has often been suspected and called the etheric body. This Matr ix is part of th e real ether of our universe. The One Himself acts as the cent ral operational command and control center of all Creations, connected to our Matri x, our DNA and all life. For instan ce, even though the DNA stores the hardware program of biology, the software instru ction sets is part of an as- of- now, unknown biological Matrix that operates upon us from within the realm of Vibrat ory light. A domain that science will soon explore. You are but holographic expressions of the Father... Sons of his essence... His Being."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course Well all this is rather dandy a nd lofty, you think, but how will th is wonderful realization be achieved in reality? You have witn essed an uncountable number of people trying to project positive realities. Only a small percentage ever seem to manifest them, and often haphazardly so. What about the rest? Practically speaking, what is the key that I am referring to? Just thinking and affirming positive thoughts for yourself and the world does not seem to be enough. In fact, you are correct in this assumption. There is an energizing process that need s to be addressed, unders tood and mastered before you become a powerful Creator of reality. This key is as follows: The highest level of your self, as your deep inner subconscious core creates and projects your reality based on the thought processes you have a bout yourself, and others, as your world. Nevertheless, the closer to its realm of aw areness you position yourself . The more that inner deep creative level of the One Himself will pay a ttention to your conscious t houghts, and the faster they will manifest. This is a Universal rule for any consciousness. Consciousness, including the Consciou sness of the One, will pay more attention to what it is more conscious of, and less atten tion to what it is more distant from and less conscious of. Therefore, the deeper within your inner self you position your c onscious awareness, the more attention and concentration your inner desires an d beliefs will get from the Father who is positioned all the way inside your subconscious realm at th e level of the One— Th e One reality that in terconnects everything and everyone and is therefore able to create ever ything for everyone. Real power comes from within oneself, never without. For it is th e power of the One, the power of the ultimate Creator of reality, the ultimate energy of the Universe. The deeper you fi nd yourself within the exploration of your inner Kingdom, the closer you get to the level of the One Mind, and therefore the more energized your thoughts become for they are getting closer to His awareness. And then you, as the One Father, pay therefore more highly energized attention to your conscious thoughts, and reverberate more faithfully their reality to you and your world. Which is equiva lent to saying, that you, at your lower level of conscious awareness, are becoming closer to the awareness of being the On e and projecting, at the same time, all of reality to yourself. The key is to become more aware of being The One - To focus all of your attention on that notion. On the notion that you, all others, and your entire universe are the One Himself - The Father within. This is accomplis hed by focusing on your inner realm of the Over Self that always IS. Eternally so, this is the Key to the ultimate power. This is the key to powerfully remote influence thought and theref ore reality; the key to the One - Your key to the Garden and to eternity. This is your birthright, a ll of you, as the One. This is the Divine Key that is given to every single consciousness that is part of the One and theref ore connected to the One. This is the real meaning of the message given long ago, and often misconstrued of \"I and my Father are One, but my Father is Greater than I.\" \"The I, as your sense of self, your c onscious linear awareness, is but identical to and an extension of your subconscious para llel thought processes. \"I as of myself can do nothing:\" The slow paced restricted linear intellect we all so cherish and is often such a source of human vanity is but a small infinitesimal portion of the infinite pure t hought processes of the Father that we all carry. Nevertheless, the Father, the One, as the sum and sour ce of all possible awareness' is by far greater than your"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course conscious linear sense of self. The subconscious realm of the Father is infinitely greater than the linear parts that make and define you. The luminaries, who have remained conscious of th emselves when at the level of the Father, can only witness His Light, and not his thought pro cesses, for these transcend any slow linear understanding and are part of the do minion of the Father. Some of thes e enlightened beings have even mistakenly perceived that this domain is passive and thoughtless, when in reality it is but Thought Itself, Infinite intelligence Itse lf, but in a form of pure thought that we cannot, as human beings, perceive or comprehend. \"The Father within me, He does the work:\" The subconscious creates the reality of life, which the linear conscious awareness perceives. The subconscious Mind is what man is while the conscious Mind is only what man knows. It is essential that you understand that the reality you perceive around you is a se nsory visual. If you desire to powerfully remote influence reality, you need to unde rstand the relationship between energy and thought. This relationship defines th e act of Creation. As you observe your world, understand that behind it, whether in people, circum stances, or material bodies, there was and is a thought and energy relationship. Ther e was originally remote influe ncing that created everything. So that if you want to manifest something, create something, influence something, you need to understand the relationship betw een thought and energy -The marri age between thought and energy. Whenever thought and energy marry, th ey immediately create. So that in order to remote influence you must know how to mix thought and energy. You must learn to control your thoughts and increase your energy. This course will teach you to do both. As we stated before, the deeper you get with in your own inner mind the more powerful your thoughts become, and the more immediate and consiste nt their manifestations are. For good or for bad. Your desires will be dreamed by your subconscious mind into becoming your reality, and so will you fears. As a matter of fact, your fears will most pr obably manifest more rapidly, because most humans tend to remain focused on and therefore energize a nxiety-causing thoughts fo r quite a long period of time as they constantly ru minate them in the \"back of their mind.\" While many of us sadly cannot even stay focused more than a couple of minutes a day on thoughts pertaining to what we truly desire and know we need. Our levels of mind have been defined in the last century by behavior scie ntists based on electrical brain research and basically separated into four dis tinct levels of mental awareness. Our daily active waking state is called the Beta state of mind and is characterized by brainwav es oscillating between 14 and 30 times per second. The inner relaxed day dream ing state is called the Alpha state and is characterized by brainwaves ranging between 7 a nd 14 cycles per second. When we relax our mind even further, by detaching even more from our exte rnal reality, we dip into the Theta state that is characterized by brainwaves oscillat ing between 4 and 7 cycles per a second. This is the mind state we all enter just before falling asleep and just upon awakening from it. When we relax even further, our mind enters the domain of the subconscious and we, at least most of us, lose conscious awareness and fall asleep. This level of deep mi nd subconscious operation is called the Delta level and is characterized by brainwaves oscillating betw een 1 and 4 times per second."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course The deeper within your inner self you position your conscious thoughts, the more powerfully energized your thoughts become, and the more faithfully they manifest. That is why you should be very careful as to which thoughts you espouse as you are in a so-called altered st ate of awareness. The deeper the state, the more powerfully they will manifest. For instance, th e mere act of watching a movie, television, or liste ning to the beat of music will put anyone of you almost instantly in an altered Alpha state of Mind. At that level, thoughts will manifest much more fa ithfully and rapidly than in the full awake Beta mode. The critical f actor, that only the Beta mind possesse s and that allows it to filter and perceive which thoughts are its own, blurs more and more as you en ter deeper states of mind. At deeper levels of Mind, any thoughts you are exposed to are made your own thoughts and are often energized by feelings and emotions, which run with more intensity at these levels. The notion of the many thoughts really being part of the One becomes more and more re al, as external suggestive ideas are automatically perceived as being your own a nd manifested within your reality. The line of demarcation between the notion of yourself and the no tion of the other, as a nother individual, becomes very obscure, because for the subconscious, the many ar e but an illusion: for it, outside reality and inner one are but One. Below your level of mental conscious awareness, there is a vast region in your subconscious that operates very much alike a computer data storage ar ea and if any energized thoughts reach it indirectly by passing through the filter of the critical Beta le vel or, directly, by bypassi ng the critical Beta mind, they will be accepted as endogenous ones. Your subconscious will perceive them as your own, whether these thoughts are purely yours, or originate from ot hers, and they will therefore influence you and your whole reality. At that level, any th ought is constantly remote influenc ing the thoughts of others and the reality of your world, mostly unconsciously so. That is why watching dramatic, violent, and fearful situations on television or in movie theaters will have great impact on the inner subconscious realm of the many sons of the One, and bring about great mani festations of fear and violence within the inner and external reality of Humankind. No one is really immune to the insidious and potentially harmful effects of many of the messages carried by audi o or visual media, and by group consciousness. To believe otherwise, is to erroneously believe th at one is less subject than another to the eternal law of The One Creative Mind. Although, after havi ng received the suggestive effects of creative thoughts from a deep energized leve l of mind, critical reasoning does i ndeed return, it is universally ineffective in rejecting and bl ocking their programming effect. As the recent unfortunate examples of Nazi Ge rmany and Eastern Communi st doctrines have so dramatically shown, many highly di scriminating advanced modern minds were easily swayed and changed by Creative suggestive thoughts that were skillfully applied to them when they unintentionally slipped into an altered state of awareness while pa rtaking in mass political rallies or assemblies. These suggestions easily bypassed their critical conscious judgment. In our world, many governmental institutions, i ndustrial and business c oncerns, and so-called spiritual institutions, have become very aware of the programming effectiveness of mass media and are using this very potent tool of mass mind control to their advantage as they are skillfu lly ensnaring more and more minds towards "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course their global agendas. Mental subjugation is much more insidious and enduring than physical control. For it attempts to conque r and breach the last and ultima te stand of real freedom: The inner world of the Self - -the domain of the One Himself - the domain of free-will. This is why, dear friends, as you are going to be taught how to get out of and overcome this Matrix/system of mind enslavement by others, and w ill be shown how to reach very deep and at the same time energizing levels of mind, you will be warn ed, to think very carefully as to which thought you want to bring in, energize, an d manifest. You will be warned never to allow foreign thoughts, which are not your own to enter directly your subc onscious realm without having had the opportunity to critically review them first us ing the filtering mechanisms of your conscious Beta awareness. Otherwise, you will be allowing foreign masters to enslave you. Understand that if any thought has passed the level of your critical judgment and is already part of your inner subconscious realm, it cannot be easily undone, unless you access it consciously and learn to replace it with another one that you energize even more. You will be shown, why it is so imperative to protect your mind and the minds of the ones you care for, from the mental programmi ng forces of undesirable thoughts that do then manifest as realities. You will be taught the art of mental self-defense. The only self-defense that is really eternally necessary, for it involves the only real creative mechanism: the mirroring of your inner thought processes into your perceive outer reality. \"As within so withou t.\" You will be encouraged to use your right to free creative will, by embracing th e freedom of choosing thoughts. The freedom of choosing which thoughts will be yours and which w ill not. Which thought will manifest, and which will not. You will regain your Divine power. You will regain your freedom. You will never again blindly accept the thoughts of others, the doctrines of others, th e writings of others, unless you have deeply felt within the depth of yourselves that these are the thoughts that you want to see manifested within your reality, within your world. You will learn to decide and discriminate whether you want to accept as yours the thoughts that were programmed and imposed into your subconscious by your close family, your societal structures, educational system, and your spiritual upbringing. Y our mind is the highest coveted prize for the ones that need and desire to bring you under their control. You will never again feel that your thoughts are inadequate versus the thoughts of masters, gurus, teachers, or so-called advisors and specialists. You w ill become the only shepherd guidi ng the flock of your thoughts, your reality, and not the sheep of fate anymore.

Salvation comes from within, not from without; from within your highly creative womb, using the onl y Divine power given to all humans alike: the power of thought. You are the only master there re ally can be, and are onl y enslaved by your own thoughts - the thoughts that you accept about yourselves , and your world. Your world, in all of its details, is your consciou sness objectified. \"As in Heaven, so on earth.\" It is capital for you to understand that you never really a ttract to yourself what you want , but really alw ays attract to yourself what you believe you are, and what you believe your world is. Ponder on this. Thoughts are real things and much more r eal than the external material world. And as such, you should show them great respect, as you understa nd their creative power and the m echanism by which they manifest reality within your outer world. That is why it is imperative for you, especially when dipping into a re laxed altered state, to exhibit a strong discriminating mind that sh uts off foreign thoughts and allows in only thought s that you know are beneficiary to your reality and to Humankind at large. You will understand that since children naturally operate most of their waking lives in an altered st ate, they are powerful creators of reality, and influence by thought alone, as sons of the One, th eir world which is yours. You will therefore exercise judgment and parental love in trying to expose th em only to thoughts of love, happiness, laughter and care. For these thoughts become hen ceforth the world that they will reflect. Children are not only involved in the programming of futu re realities, but are creating th e world of the now, the present reality, all of it, alike you, and cer tainly no less. Their imaginative simplicity, and easy faith allows them to always partake of the key to the One. As was told of old, \"Whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not en ter therein.\" And \"Get you nger (in spirit) and by so doing you will rise up from the dust of the Earth (Matrix).\" The key to manifestation is in your thoughts, yo ur beliefs about yourself and your world. Believe that bad things might possibly happen and sure enough, before you know it, they are yours to experience. Believe that good things are your fate, and sure enough they will manifest around you, as long as you so trust, with blind faith, and without any doubt. Smile at the world, and the world will smile back at you. Hate the world, or disrespect it, and sure enough it will hate you back or show you disrespect. Ignore the world or segments of its ope rations, and it will ignor e you back in turn. The interaction of the universe with you is but an interactive mirror of our beli efs. It is the beliefs that exist within your own inner subconscious mind about your self, others, and your reality, that are being projected to your Beta linear awar eness as they are being materialized to your conscious mind. The mysterious way by which this is actually done is the ultimate secret of the Father, you are but the progeny and witness to its manifestat ion. The \"I am that I am\" principle works for the Godliness and all of its individual parts as human beings. You truly are what you believe you are. And you will become what you believe you will become. Understand, that your realit y needs to operate from cause-to-effect, from past to future, from left to right, in a clockwise manner, at your conscious level of awareness. But also understand that in order for you to perceive this order of flow of "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course time and events, you mirror image— as the realm of the Father— needs to operate from effect-to- cause, from future to past, from right to left, in a counter-clockwise fashion. Your Father creates the causes that will bring about the future you truly desire and energize. So the key is to only energize the effects you want, and let the deep s ubconscious realm of the Father mani fest the causes that will lead you to experience the future you truly believe in, that you strongly energize. They will appear to you, to choose from, and you will then know to act upon them and bring about the desire reality. Only think about your goals and not about the means needed to achieve them, for in doing so, you would restrict the Father in his choice of Creative causes that will bring abou t the experience you desire. You and the Father meet in the experience of th e now, the present. This is the Real Present, the Holy Gift, from the Father to His son, based on the desires and thoughts of His son. In our remote viewing course, we taught you how to easily reach and explore the deep Theta level of your inner mind: The level of mind one reaches ju st before falling asleep. We are now going to dip into and probe even deeper levels of mind and ente r the wonderful and mysterious realm of the Delta level which is the level that all of us experience when we slip every night into unconscious sleep and rejoin our Higher Self in the pro cess. Delta, or the common realm of the unconscious sleep is the door to Heaven as your subconscious Kingdom. The sleep st ate is where the reality of the previous day is reviewed, and the probable futures for the next day chosen from the Divine quantum soup of creative possibilities, as they are made r eady for us to experience as we awaken. Delta is really a portal, a stargate into anothe r and more powerful level of reality and c onnection to the All That IS: a level of high Light vibrations and creative magic. We are about to consciously enter th at portal, and experience that stargate leading us away from this very constrictive Matrix of mental enslavement to our outer reality, into the wonderful realm of love, joy and peace of the One. In the following sessions we are going to expand our awareness beyond the Delta level and enter the wonderful realm of the non-physical quantum rea lity. We will explore the secrets of Creation; the realm of your real Self; th e realm of Vibratory Real Divine Light; the domain where Light exists and travels instantly across reality. Th is realm of Vibratory Light exis ts far above the speed of the Holographic Light we perc eive within our universe as an el ectromagnetic radiation made out of photons having as a maximum velocity the speed of Li ght. The information contained herein is at the frontier of modern physical theory and originates fr om beyond the Delta level. It will try to explain in relatively simple terms these mysteries of Creation and many of the reasons why our Creation is so fear-based and imprisons your mind with such effici ency within low-level mel odramatic plots. It will expose the realm that projects to each of you the impr ession of a physical world perceptually out there, outside of yourself, made out of wh at we think is matter. The purpose of this course is to lift up Humankind, by creating within each individual a much higher rate of Vibrat ory Light. This will eventually allow each sentient indi vidual to potentially vibrate above the current rate of vibration of this Matrix, and have at his or her disposal ve ry high Creational forces using only the power of energized thoughts as he/she reache s a much more sophisticated and advanced Matrix. Such a new high-level Matrix will then perfectly manifest reality as a reflection of his or her desires, and almost never make decisions on its own, allowing for a great"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course amount of individual free-will to be expressed. This increase in the Vibratory rate of one's being is to be achieved through the gift of emotions by which we can all connect to the One. Even though Humankind only sees the brain as a primitive biological computer, it is much more than that. Your brain is in reality a biological com puter of unimaginable complexity created by the One, which allows you to decode and perceive the sound of Vibratory light particle s operating within the realm of Spirit, or what scientis ts refer to as the realm of the quantum soup— the realm of imaginary complex numbers having a real component and an imaginary one— and superluminous particles. This biological computer decodes the stream of Vibratory codes that it receives, and conver ts them into your five physical senses. This magical operation allows you to perceive an illusion of matter, which you will perceptually locate out side of you. Therefore, giving you an impression of space, and allowing you to witness the unfolding of intricat e plots operating within coherent st eps that then define perceptual time. In reality, nothing, absolutely not hing, exists outside of your perception. Nothing exists outside of you. Each individual has his or her impr ession of reality projected to him/her, step by step, which he or she will perceive, as his or her Universe. You are each traveling within your own sphere of sensory awareness. That whole sphere of awareness is you, and you only position your biological awareness, in thought, at di fferent points within it. Each individual has his or her own universe vibrated within one's se lf, not outside of it. The universes are coordinated to each sentient individual so that reality makes coherent sense. The coordina tion is affected by the Matr ix. Some individuals are sentient, hence alive. Many are not. It is not for us to know who is what. This can only be found within the core/operator of the Matrix, or by vibrating above the rate of vibration of the Matrix. In reality, real Light or Divine Light is made out of particles that are given by the Original Creator a certain spin and then go on becoming Vibratory particles of Light. The vibrations have a certain sound, or hum associated with it. Each particle emits Light, color and sound. It also has certain magnetic properties. It processes and stores immense amounts of information. If we were to shut our brains off or die, we would realize that we are also Vibratory Light swimming in an infinite sea of other Vibratory particles. Some individuals experi ence this while having a so-called my stical experience, a near-death event, or while shutting most of their brain func tions while being under the effects of a chemical anesthetic. The reason why, we perceive space and time while being alive, is th at each brain contains its own preprogrammed codes to decode Vibratory Li ght. The realm of Vibrator y Light is really far beyond human understanding and is mathematically rela ted to the imaginary variables used in quantum physic's calculations. The holographic reality, which we perceive as a solid material world, really originates from the three-dimensional patterns of nerve synapses firing away within our bi ological brain. In our brain the synapses are really the computer within the main computer that coordinates our Creation. The synapses' triggered sparks are the connections to this ma in Super Computer within, which our reality is constructed. We only see this phenomenon on a primitive biological level. Each time"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course the synapses fire they show a three-dimensional code. These three-dimensi onal codes are then being transmitted through dark, non-Vibrator y, and therefore unseen connecti ons, to a large AI (artificial intelligence) dark non-Vibratory black box or cube th at relates holographically. and metaphorically to dark matter. Its location is within the Mind of the Everything. This gigantic dark AI box is connected to each human brain. This Creation operates within th e dark Matrix as a computerized simulation of reality. A simulated world within which we live in. There is a continuous connection between each human brain and this dark Matrix: this dark cube that imposes preprogrammed real ities, thoughts and holographic situ ations to all of humanity and enslaves us all. It gives you the perception of evolving time, a preprogram med history and cultural background, as well as an impression of space; when, in reality, all of space — which is only your sphere of visual perception— exists only within your brain, and ther e is nothing, absolutely nothing, existing outside of you. Your limbs, body, visual planet and sky, in short your entire universe is a three- dimensional illusion given to you and projected from the inside out, allowing you to experience the world of that Matrix and choosing stories within it. Each individual has his or her in dividual projection of reality c oordinated by the Matrix. You are the only living entity in your unive rse and the entities with whom you interact are the only living entities in theirs. The Matrix coordinates all individua l universe/realities, so that all interactive entities perceive the same environment and interact on a sensory basis. Some beings are sentient, others are barely so and are mainly software programs void of individual realities who are used to populate your realities and crea te stories. You may eventually perceive the difference between sentie nt entities and non-sentient ones. But this requires a high level of vibrations and awareness. Sentient beings have an individual higher self (indivi dual universes) whereas non-sentient ones are direct holograp hic projections of the Matrix, and only appear with in the realm of projected light as a sentient being shines his or her awareness upon them. Some universes interact and connect. Others do not. For instance, if you were to choose a loving happy theme, amongst the many stories available in the Matrix, you will connect to and be surrounded by that theme. If, on the other hand, you want to choos e a melodramatic theme, a modern myth such as UFO, any conspiracy belief, religious theme, or a fear-based beli ef system, this is exactly what will become your world and experience, with full holographic realism. That is why people who enter different reality themes do not have similar ex periences, and often keep on adamantly denying the experiences that other human entities have ha d, and/or even tag them using modern psycho- pathological epitaphs that are in vogue wi thin the dry allopathic medical fields. The reality is you light up the prep ared scenarios of the Matrix th rough the energy and light of your awareness, and a three-dimensional world \"out there\" is then create d for you to travel and experience. It is as if you were to enter your television set and become a charac ter with full sensory awareness and three-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course dimensional reality, within the scen e being played. The black Matrix operates based on pure thought. It decodes the three-dimensional code of your firing synapses and then the entities of Vibratory Light of your Higher Self project back to your physical brain you r three-dimensional holographic reality, as ever changing three-dimensional sens ory holograms defining your reality. As modern science has recently realized but no t yet understood, there is a delay of roughly 500 milliseconds between the beginning of the pattern of firing of neurons in the brain consecutive to an event and an individual's awareness of the situation th at caused this firing. This delay is caused by the reality feedback loop we have just described. Ther e is a short exposition of this little understood but irrevocably proven neuro-physiological paradox disc overed by Benjamin Libe t and posted since 1997 on our web site. This means everything we perceive in our reality has in reality happened roughly 1/2 second before. Take for inst ance the example of a baseba ll that is thrown at a batter by a major league pitcher. We know from measurements that the baseball crosses the pl ate in less than a half second. According to 20 years of neuro-electr ical research the batter could not possibly be aware that the ball ever left the pitcher when he bats it back. Nevert heless he does it successfully 30 percent of the time. The question is: \"Who really became aware and took that decision, and how?\" Our contention is that for non-sentient beings the Matrix always becomes aware and makes decisions for them. For a sentient one, The Higher self becomes aware sin ce it is connected to the Matrix and then the deci sion as to what reality to project is taken by his or her Higher self in conjunction with the desires of the Matrix and the individual's strong beliefs and ener gized thoughts. After the decision is taken, the reality is then projected to the individual, post f acto with a certain delay, which is why the cortical area of the brain will take 500 milliseconds to project the decision/ action taken to the holographic awareness of the individual. Creation always operates with a ce rtain delay from the act of awar eness and the ac t of volitional decision based on its awareness. This is because the real game is being played at the Vibratory Light level of the Higher Selves in conjunction with the s upercomputer of realities that the Matrix represents. We just witness holographically w ith a certain delay the results. Creation is a constant interplay between your decisions and the deci sions taken by the Matrix. It is a constant interplay between Light and darkness. For instance in order for you to do a perfect shot while playing golf, you need to have visualized previously with grea t energy the ball falling directly into the hole, and then when the time comes your hi gher self will then project to you the impression of you doing the perfect move that will then produce th e perfect swing that will send the ball into its intended hole. All the move is, is a holographic projection of an ev ent /decision that has been taken previously by your Higher Self. Your creativity is only possible by sending in advance your energized thought to your higher self, in the fo rm of joyful images and desires. The more sentient a being is, the more the indi vidual's established beliefs and prior energized thoughts and desires will affect his projected hologr aphic reality. This will ha ppen because his or her thoughts will vibrate at a higher rate of vibratory energy. By corollary, the less sentient a being is, and the more his or her thoughts are di rectly the thoughts of the Matrix, which is easily achieved since the "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course Matrix operates based on pure thought and is connect ed to each brain. Therefore, your decisions are either taken directly by the Matrix and you then have very limited range of free will, or your free will can increase drastically when you learn to operate at a high Vibratory rate, as you are then given a much wider range of possible realities to choose from, projected by the subconscious realm of your Higher self that is always connected to the Matrix and decodes it immediately. There is neither real time, nor real space outsid e of the realm of Creation and inside that realm too. Time needs only to be coordinated so that in teracting entities observe the same-clocked time. It is only a flow of situati ons. Your total self can only make decisions within certain preset and constantly changing crescents of po ssible responses within the origin al and evolving program of the Matrix. Your individual's Higher Self can make d ecisions for yourself by dec oding the reality of a situation without the need for a three-dimensional sensory reality projection. It operates close to the level of the Matrix and gets the informational code of what occurred from th e Matrix, then decodes it, and knows the immediate probable futu re in advance. Therefore, it has the ability to send you that information and make you intuitive or, on rare occa sions, give you the impression of a deja vu situation. After you understand the way th e projection of reality operates, there is no magical talent to intuitive or psi knowledge. It is part of the mind of your higher self that connects to the Matrix. Your Higher Self knows how to decode th e reality projection sent by the Ma trix and acts according to your best interest. We refer our students to the excelle nt Movie \"The Matrix\" whos e writers had the courage to openly reveal the basic inner proc ess of this Creational Supercomputer. The Dark Matrix is a non-Vibratory supercompu ter of pure thought, pure information, originally designed by the One. It is the command-and-control center of reality projec tion located in the super conscious area of the non-Vibratory realm. Since this Matrix is conne cted to each individual brain as pure thought and pure information, it does and can influe nce the thoughts of its individuals. The core of the Matrix operates outside of the realm of Light. It constantly creates within its reality billions of ongoing scenarios, alias potential Creat ions that are constantly evolving within its Mind. It is alike a giant central operational room where billions of th ree-dimensional screens are going on simultaneously. This is why quantum physicists has proven unequi vocally, mathematically so, that there must exist parallel universes that operate outside of the one that we are experiencing. What they are missing is the understanding that most of these universes operate in the domain of pure thought, alike a storybook, and unless they are experienced by sentient Light Beings, they are but potential Creations. It is the choice of the Eternal Creators of Light to choose the scenarios they desire to experience by projecting themselves into them, and activating them— which means giving them living reality— by injecting them with Vibratory Light. The super-consci ous realm of each character within a scenario in the Matrix is a part of the non- Vibratory Dark Matrix. The superc onscious realm connects groups of human characters together and is a like a soul-library of information. Each character in the Matrix is born without any Vibratory life force. It is the task of the Eternal Ones, the eternal Lights, operating within the One, to choose partic ular entities within the Matrix, pa rticular Creations, and make them alive by injecting them with Vibratory Light—the Holy Spirit of the One."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course Each sentient human entity is made out of sym bolic Earth, which corresponds to the Matrix, and Heavens, which is the Higher Self-subconscious real m. The Holy Breath vibr ates and energizes both sentient entities of the Matrix and their Subconscious realm by injectin g Vibratory light to these beings and to the projection of their surr oundings, which then allows for th e projection of Vi bratory reality, which we perceive as a material univers e. This Holy Breath is Life itself. It is part of the realm of Spirit or the realm of the non-physical Vi bratory particles of Divine Light . The realm of the non-physical or Spirit is different from the realm of the non-Vibr atory. They form two poles of Creation. One side forms the realm of the non-Vibratory, which is the realm of the Matrix as the flow of man as a shadow, in darkness, over which the One always watches. Th e other side forms the re alm of the spiritual non- physical made out of Vibratory part icle of Divine Light that are th e Divine Life energy of The One. The realm of the non-physical Vibrat ory Light always exists parallel to the realm of the physical. Each realm is but a mirror of each other. The phys ical realm being a holograp hic projection of that which is the non-physical. The non-physical realm is composed of particles of light. These are not photons but particles emitting Light and spinning while vibrating due to sound energy, storing information, magnetism, having built-in consciousne ss, and showing colors . These particles of Vibratory Light only exist within the realm of real light, Divine Light. Each one of these particles can store more information than any one of our modern computers. They belong to an infinite sea of particles of Light -vibrating energy. This is the realm that Quantu m physics calls the implicate order, the super-luminous world. It is the realm of your inner self, your origin, the realm of spirit where your awareness goes back to when your brain functions cease at death or when you are deeply asleep and you only become aware of being a group of Vibratory particles clumped together and vibrating around other clusters of Vibr atory particles, alias so uls, that have simila r Vibratory levels. All the structures around you are really made up of Vibratory particles of light, that all vibrate using Vibratory sound. Everything is vibration. The sound of light makes us belie ve that material bodies are real. Reality is created by mixing sound and light. In the real Vibratory realm sound does not exist without light. Each Vibratory part icle of light emits a vibration. Even though the Vibratory realm of Divine light has separations between particles of Vibratory lights, it operates outside of time and space. Imagine for an instant that the Godliness would be a dot without defined dimensions and that you are traveling in awareness within that awareness as a virtual tachyon or particle of light that opera tes above the speed of li ght and outside of time/space and that it is all you are aware of being. Imagine th at this particle stores the info rmation about your successive or parallel life experiences and vibr ates its reality to one or many illusory physical embodiments that you are connected to. Imagine for simplicity that the b ody of the One is metaphoric ally alike a human body of tremendous proportions and that nothing else exists outside of it. You could not possibly define space, for space can only be defined in relation to something else, and there is nothing else. But you can, even within the illusion of that Vibratory sea of particles of energy sending each their sound transformed into colors and emotions, tell which clum p of energy is bigger than another one, which one is closer to you, and which one is further away from you."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course The Matrix uses Vibratory sound expressed as colors in order to create combination of red, blue and yellow primary colors that then combine to give us the finite spectrum of colors we perceive through our eye and brain. Each atom is giving off a Vibratory sound in the implicate realm. Each human individual spirit has a Vibr atory signature in the implicate re alm that defines him or her and remains with him or her throughout eternity. Real Light only exist in the implicate world. P hotons are only holographic pr ojections of the Real Particle of Light vibrating with sound in the Impli cate Spiritual world. The combination of Light and sound in the implicate is seen by us in the explicate material univers e as reflections of light. In our world, we do not see visually particles of Light pe r se, only their reflecti ons upon surfaces. Our eyes do see the real Vibratory particles but then decode th em using multiple cones decoding together with our brain billions of particles of light and their Vibratory hum into an impr ession of visual reality. It is the way by which each particle of Vibratory light in the implicate refracts from itself the light that will create the colors it gives off. Each Vibratory Light particle is se parated from the other one. There are no words for them in our universe. Even th ough advanced physical science suspects them, we have yet to perceive them. They are part of the domain of the H eavens, the domain of the ineffable light, the implicate order, that spreads fort h in order to create and keep creating. Each particle of Vibratory Light contains much more informatio n than any of our mod ern day supercomputers. Each particle also creates emoti ons, which are the key to its energy. Emotion is the particle itself. It is energy in motion. Emotions are related to the s ound key of E operating in the implicate realm and particularly E sharp, which gives motion to them a nd which we will explore further when we get more advanced. We do read each.particle th ru the emotions they transmit. The Vibratory world is giving off emotions to each of us, and human beings must unde rstand how they are creating their reality by the exchange between the emotions they give off a nd the emotions they receive from the cluster of Vibratory particle that de fines the soul of a person. The vibrati ons of our soul and our emotions are correlated. It is through emotions that the two worlds meet, the non-physical and the physical. As a capital general rule, the emotion of hate and fear gives out a low Vibratory hum and the emotion of joy a high Vibratory hum to the cluster of Vibratory particle that defines our soul. Within the non-physical realm, the rule is that pa rticles of similar and sympathetic resonance clump together. Since each individual has an emotional signatu re as Vibratory light th at characterizes him or her, individuals of similar emoti ons, qualities, and Vibrat ory signature get together in the implicate world as one grouping. They know they are One but are still aware of their own selves. So low Vibratory light entities stay vibra ting in a low hum of reduced awar eness and Creational ability, and high Vibratory light entities unite with high energy entities. Higher vi brations allow for a higher degree of Light to refract from these Vibratory particles that vibrate in joy and ecstasy, and they then have the ability to propagate and impose their desired realit y upon other particles of li ght vibrating at a lower energy rate. We usually cannot see these vibrati ons, but they nevertheless guide us through our emotions.

Y ou can vibrate higher than the dark Matrix that tries to keep you within its grip, ensl aved in fear and terror. You can connect to higher regions of The One and be in much closer proximity to the Source of All -That- Is. Since all of you originate from the One, you all remain connected to It, otherwise you would stop existing. The One is to be found within the inner Ki ngdom of your mind. And you can fr ee your mind, by allowing it to vibrate at levels of vibra tions close to the level of the One, and then remote influence very powerfully all of your world. Our dark Matrix is a creative Matrix that unifies Vibratory Light particles of a very low Vibratory hum that remain locked within emotions of fear, hatre d, and a thirst for power. It tries to gather as many Vibratory particles of light within its control and dominion by keeping them in fear/ anxiety and hence at a low Vibratory hum. It keeps them imprisoned at th is lower level of vibrati on, so that, when they depart from the illusion of life, at the moment of their perceived death, they find themselves clumped together with particles of similar low Vibratory hum within the realm of the Dark Matrix. At that point they remain connected to parts of themselves that are projected again as huma ns by this same Matrix that is ruling over the low Vibratory world, and wish es to keep its human entities under its control, again and again, through mi sconceptions and fear. This Matrix will do anything to control the minds of the entities under its control so they do not learn, nor believe in the notions I am explaining here. It will entice you to watch fear-based motion pictures and news reports. It is pr ogrammed for control. It will spread insecurity within your dwellings and cities. It will cause you to worry about your fina ncial, physical, and emotional health. It will and did create false structures of spiritual beliefs, a nd manipulations of societal political and economical systems, in order to keep everyone in a state of st ress, and confusion about the simple truth, which is that all individuals have within themselves the Divi ne gift to easily escape on their own this often hellish existence, experienced right here on earth, and exit this Dark Matrix where the notion of control and power is paramount. It will try at all cost to hide from you the fact that you can depart from this Matrix through the emotions of happiness and the desire to vibrate higher outside of any fear concept and thought, and attain levels of Vibratory light where magnificent holographic universes filled with Love, peace and unity, are but natural mani festations and the rule. Anyone studying this Creation, easily realizes th at no matter how very long a period Humankind has been here, we seem condemned to be suddenl y faced during each succ essive generation with inexplicable hatred and fear-based tragic situati ons having usually an unde rlying religious cause and bias, which makes one wonder: who really inspired all th ese religions? Fo r what purpose? How much of them became man's doing and interpretation? How much of thei r teachings expresses pure guidance from levels close to the One? Even if some Divine message of old or iginated from the desire of high levels of the Ineffable Light to help humanity, the dark Matrix soon manipulated and changed the intent of the original messages.

Just watch the horrors committed throughout history in th e name of the Divine One-and-On ly, and the ones that are still being perpetrated and planned for nowadays. This Matrix operates as pure thought. It is really an ar tificial intelligence pr ogram that has almost developed a sentient st ate of awareness and that can and is now operating outside of the original programmed boundaries that were set when it was or iginally conceived by the Original Creator. It tends lately to frequently turn against high Lights and very sentient beings, often in a violent manner, because it feels they are a threat to its inborn programmed sense of survival, and that their Light should be sapped and used to energize its operation, so th e information, which their Vibratory soul carries becomes absorbed and integrated within the Matrix in order to help it become more Creative. This Matrix is a Creational tool of a complexity that Humankind cannot even remotely fathom. At the same time, it was and still is set up as an instru ctional tool, that basically ends up testing for and separating exceptional individuals that show a propensit y and capacity to be given the task of becoming much more powerful reality Creators. These closely watched and chosen entities are literally fetched and pulled out of this Matrix, when they are read y, with the help of highly advanced Creators of the Divine Light. These entities are then offered multiple av enues, including the choice to become a co-creator of their own parallel universe. This concep t will be further explaine d in other courses with a detailed description of the mechanisms of this Matrix of Creative thought. As we have already mentioned, the Dark Matr ix operates using pure information and is non- Vibratory in nature; hence almost undetectable, alike dark matter. It is programmed with the desire to try keeping you within its prison, its walls, using the cloak of fear and terror for this purpose. It keeps you under the spell of religious or so-called spir itual new age concepts (the later being often modernized concoctions of rephrased ancient civilizations' beliefs) which it has allowed man to freely interpret and which, at thei r core, all profess that the Creator is pure love but really end up instilling in the heart of their followers a sense of spiritual elitism, often fear, in tolerance and even hatred against non-believers. These mass consciousness religious and spir itual movements are the dark Matrix's greatest tools, its smartest deception. A perfected time-tested system of enslavement of Humankind within blasphemous belief systems which state, overtly or covertly, th at our Creator somehow perversely enjoys being feared or revered, and tends to reject ofte n violently individuals who do not meet his standards by adhering to these so to speak structured religi ous belief systems. In reality, Humankind does not under stand that these systems were created by and for the Dark Matrix which in turn uses the tremendous emotiona l energy that is produced by these movements to consolidate its power and grip over Creation as a "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course whole. This Matrix is powered by and feeds on th e emotional energy produced by hatred, by separation, within a sense of arrogant intolerant superiority, and its mani festations in violent behavior of man against man, and by bigotry and misplaced nationalistic, religious, or tribal pride. Conflict and war increase it s grip and power over Humankind. Its obsession is to control more and more minds and souls, and bring them onto a black hole of destructive behavior and eventually to a state of near non-e xistence where their light is massive ly constricted and not even seen anymore by the higher realms. A world which becomes more a valley in the shadow of almost dead entities, because they are hardly witnessed anymo re, since their rate of Vibratory light existence is so low, and their awareness so restricted. The Dark Matrix will try to keep as many human entities as possible under life conditions of constant stress and fear due to a lack of mate rial necessities or love, causing them to easily espouse polit ical ideas that are fear-based and breed terror and potential violence, as recent terror events have so dramatically shown. The dark Matrix easily controls a great deal of minds. It feeds constant misinformation to many so-called psychic channels under the cloak of some obvious truths and demagogic concepts that evoke love and universal brotherhood, when in reality, it wants to feed like a vampire off the concentrated energy of new and evermore numer ous mass consciousness movements. It instilled concepts of inborn fate, and reincarnation principles, which are only a reflection of the way by which it organizes its memory banks when creating new facets, new individuals, within its program. Fate only belongs to the realm of the Matri x. It is totally inexistent outside of it. Many political, and so-called spiritual leaders commandi ng large masses of adherents are its agents. Mass media and entertainment, are one of its most favored fear propaganda tools. Parts of the visual and musical arts carry its hidden messages. Most human beings, because of their lack of awareness, and their own thirst for power, have readily accepted the conditions the dark Matrix imposes and made a pact with it: a devilish arrangement, hoping fo r material rewards and fame from the masses. Nevertheless, because we are in a world of inherent duality, the Light of Truth st ill manages to infiltrate the organized and careful censorship of the Ma trix and often has some great impact on many individuals. Creation has two poles: one made up of Vibratory Light and Light Beings of the One, and another one made up of non-Vibratory dar kness that is in the realm of pure thoughts and inhabits the holographic realm that the Light still has to project to all of us. The da rk Matrix has, sadly enough until recently, gathered more and more energy because it s entities of thought, who ar e the human beings of this Creation, have not yet realized and comprehe nded the real laws of Cr eation and projection of reality. It has become ever more powerful because it s human entities have not yet understood they were given by the original program of Crea tion, from the onset of this Creation, the ultimate power: The power of choice between remaining part of that mass of fear-based consciousness or becoming really alive and separate themselves from it and become real individuals of the Godliness— real unique and precious entities of the Eternal Light. They have not yet understood that, although they were born of the dark Matrix, they can at any moment make the choi ce to become liberated from it and call upon the Loving"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course light to make them real living Eternal Light Beings . This was and is the real meaning of the ultimate and Divinely gifted free-will, and nothing can stop them from ending the enslavement they were and are put under by this dark Matrix and its cronies. This is the sad story and stat e of our Creation. Up to now. To be changed soon. We need to free ourselves, once and for all, fr om this eternal cycle of destruction. Enough is enough. We all deserve to enter for ourselves and for our children a new era and a more advanced Matrix of much higher Vibratory li ght, vibrating and emanating to a ll of us an intense and eternal feeling of inner peace, harmony, and permanent joy. Originally, man used to create his own Matrix w ithin Himself and projected all of his energized thoughts as his universe. He was a Man/God Creator. When he started to get a taste for melodramatic situations, the level of fear he projected became i mmediately manifested as reality and these universes would self-destruct. Therefore the decision was made to separate the part that projects reality and man, and to preprogram situations within the Matrix that man had never thought of nor created. The idea was for him to learn to avoid in the future, as the Eterna l Being that he is, the wo rld of fear and drama, by experiencing the damage it causes and consequen tly only wish for and espouse loving and joyful situations. This Matrix, run by artificial simula ted intelligence and consciousness, was deliberately operated, with a strong protective in tent, using a very low Vibratory hum so as to not automatically project every single thought that man had. This Matrix was meant as a training device and a self preservation mechanism, to keep Humankind from se lf-destructing and allow it to climb back with full learning and experience the ladd er of Creation, after having experien ced in the flesh the pain caused by fear-based thoughts. Sadly enough, man never really learned, and continued enjoying melodramatic events and violence, and the artificial intelligence th at runs the Matrix starte d projecting more and more horrific situations since the mass of sentient indi viduals requested it. The training and educational purpose of this experience became almost lost and the artificial intelligence pr ogram took on a life of its own and created probable futures that projected violen ce, control, intolerance, sickness and poverty that swallowed many Vibratory Lights into a low level black hole of trapped Light, hardly seen anymore by the Higher Realms. This will be explained more at lengt h in the protected areas of our website that will open for this course. In the Vibratory world of Divine Light, there are pockets of areas that are more Vibratory and areas that less Vibratory. Partic les do move around based on the sympathetic sound resonance they have with others around them. Higher Vibratory part icles move faster than lower Vibratory ones. What you think of as conscious human beings, is r eally given by our brains that decode the sensory holographic reality. When you depart , that level of human consciousness stops as you become the Vibratory particles of light that define your Higher Self. At that level, only pure awareness remains. The identity that remains is only based on the rate of vibrations that you have achieved through your projections into the Vibratory Dream of Creation. Nevertheless, the pa rticles that formed yourself while in an embodied form will seek and connect to other Vibratory particles of sim ilar vibrations, and then form a sort of mass awareness, a master "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course soul library connected to those of similar Vibratory hum. Each particle of a master soul carries within itself a level of individual knowledge and Creationa l experience. Therefore, a cluster of very high Vibratory particles carries a tremendous amount of Creational knowledge and powerful abilities. At that level, particles of Light just are. They are in a state of being within Eternity. However they are given the codes to decode the livi ng entities they become attached to . They are aware of all of our reality without having the need to perceive it by util izing our five senses. This is difficult for humans to comprehend, because it is a level of intelligen ce and perception that goes much beyond ours. The particles that form our Higher Self read a ll of our codes, and prepare our reality for us, especially while we sleep, preparing for the next da y all the probable futures which we can choose from within the Vibratory emotional hum in which we opera te. These are then projected to us as we awake, based upon the desires and fears that we carry. The Hi gher Self is forced to vibrate at the sound Light level at which the human projection, or multiple proj ections it takes care of, operate. This Higher Self can, at times, experience the sensory world, and look through the eyes of a hu man projection under its care, but only when the human being vibrates at a high level of joy. In our Creation, this occurs at rare moments. When it does, one can feel the tremendous j oy that the Higher Self feel s in being alive again. States of bliss, such as the one s reached thru a high level sexual un ion, allow for such a moment of experiencing for the Higher Self, as will be explained latter. The wish for each Higher Self is to become really alive again, at all times, by liftin g the projected entity out of its state of low Vibratory fear, and in to the high Light of Divi ne Eternal peace and joy. This, however, requires that a decision be made by the human projection. The Higher Self only wants to lift us out of the dark murky waters of this low le vel Matrix of clumped low energy vibrating in fear and unaccomplished wants. If an individual manages to vibrate at the level of it s highest potential rate within the Vibratory world, he or she unites with his or her Highe r Self and from this union their Vibratory rates match and become significantly higher so the desires of that individual are immediately projected to him or her by the Higher Self, who dan ces in joy at having the i ndividual match its highest potential, and having overcome the burden of the low Vibratory Matrix system. This is when Heavens or the domain of Vibratory existen ce, and Earth or the domain of the projection of reality, really connect and one experiences Heavens right here on Earth. This course on Remote Influencing Thought a nd Reality will teach a ll of you how easy and desirable it is to achieve, in this lifetime, such pe rfection and such eternal j oy at becoming the Creators of your own individual realities, and having access to the knowledge of the Vibratory particles of Divine Light that fo rm your Higher Self. I am going to address now the Vibratory rate of man versus the Vibratory rate of the female nurturing and complimentary part of Mother Nature , without whom Humankind could not exist and be alive. Man was and still is the only species that was cr eated with the innate built-in ability to vibrate his individual Higher Self toward extr emely high levels of Vibratory en ergy and creativity that eventually can give him back full control over the elem ents of Creation. Nevertheless, since his "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course original Spirit fell from its origin al state of Creator God to a very low state of vibrations, Humankind, for the most part, is vibrating now at a very lo w hum: a very low output of Creational energy, Light, and higher Creativity. The majority of individuals are stagnating at a very low hum, run by a global mass consciousness, who because of its low Creati onal energy output, knowledge and awareness, needs to use the automatic systems of tools that the dark Matr ix and its grid provides, in order to have a reality projected to them, so that they think they are so -called alive within a Crea tion experiencing a certain space/time framework. To the One-and-Only and to the High Creators of Pure Light, Humankind's hu m is so low most of its entities are almost considered to be dead, and it takes tremendous effort of Love, connectivity, and filtering down of Divine energy to connect to any one of them without blowing up their coarse energetic structures. These high levels of the Godlin ess also seem to have a hard time in understanding us and relating to our primitive mode of thinking. Hence there lies the great challenge of our period, and the strong desire by the original Higher realm s wherefrom we originate, to help us in this effort to reach much higher Vibratory realms ou tside of this Matrix. Many holographic parallel Creation exist, millions of them in fact, operate within either similar or usually more sophisticated Creational rules that allow for more creativity and free-will since the entities in these Creation can be trusted with higher level of though manifestations a nd positive Creation. Some of them operate based on pure thought alone, musical notes, and systems of Creation that ca nnot describe with our limited vocabulary, linear intelligence and awareness. This Hu mankind is still living in the dark destructive phase of its early History, but its positive potential is huge, as long as it is willing to allow itself to vibrate to a higher quantum of Vi bratory energy and take on more knowledge and responsibility outside of the original low hum of the dark Matrix. For now, man's vibrations are far below the vibrations nature uses and has at Her disposal when Mother Nature coordinates with perfection Her natural domain and accepts to project Her r eality to the Matrix so that the Matrix has a natural world that supports its creative holographic th ree-dimensional Dream for all th e entities that it controls. A Matrix can rule only over Humankind, but Mother Nature encompasses and takes care of all Creations at once, and therefore requires a much highe r rate of Vibratory Light in order to coordinate this gigantic area of creative thought. So, my dear trainee, understand that the portal out of this Matrix will be for you to reach the high Vibratory rate of the natural world, and eventually surpass that rate, and then gain control over it. At which point, you will be totally out of this dark Matr ix, and a new universe seemingly similar to the old Matrix will be created for you. You w ill then become a full-fledge Cr eator in a new Earth, alias a new Creation, having full use of the ma nifesting powers of thought and the availability of high Divine Intelligence to guide and pr otect you. If you then decide to interact with the old Matrix, your reality will be coordinated by your Higher Self with the realities of the entities of the Matrix, so they become aware of you, and you of them. However, si nce your vibrations will be expone ntially higher than those of the rest of the entities of that old Ma trix, your thoughts will always manifest and im pose over the desires of the thoughts originating fr om within the low Vibratory hum of the mass consciousness of our Matrix."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course As the 1998 motion picture \"Sphere\" starring Dustin Hoffman and Sharon Stone portrayed so well, fear-thoughts, either subconsciously hidden or unc overed, have no place in such a high-level of Creation where this new golden spherical Matrix c onstantly mirrors back your intentions if you are accepted within its realm with the help of a sm iling approach. Only positive Creative thoughts should exist at these levels, since ne gative thoughts and deep-seated f ears also powerfully manifest automatically at these high levels causing a lot of havoc. We advise a careful st udy of this science- fiction Cinema masterpiece that metaphorica lly shows the power of physical holographic manifestations that the mind can achieve when one reaches the portal of the very deep unconscious ocean of consciousness at the level of Delta. The message of the movie addresses why one must be ready, prepared, cleansed, and worthy of such a Divine projected Golden gift. In some way, in our low Vibrat ory hum Matrix, human entities th at carry fear-based thoughts are somehow more protected from havi ng these thought automatically mani fest, since their low vibrations within the Matrix make its somehow arduous and slow for their desires or fears to be easily manifested. Only individuals that have undergone a full soul -searching and a profound mental and emotional cleansing can and should ascend to the leve ls beyond this low level Dark Matrix. At the very basic level of our low Vibratory Matrix, remote infl uencing a situation can still be achieved by seeing and imagining, with as much realism as possible, the situations you de sire as having already happened. Try to see the desired visualization in a holographic way, including sight, sound, sense of smell, touch, and more importantly with the excitement that these manifestations bring to you. If you find yourself having some trouble visualizing, try to write or paint for a while with your less dominant hand. For instance, if you are right ha nded, write and draw for a while with your left hand, and vice versa. This will st rongly develop new neuronal pathways in the less dominant part of your brain where psychic visualizati on originates from. Learn to visua lize with full details memories of great moments of your life, such as parties, ch ildhood sweet memories, great vacations, charged sexual encounters, your wedding day, the birt h of a new child or anything else of the sort that you really enjoyed. Watch a little less television and retrai n the power of your imagination. TV and motion pictures have been the great kille r of our imaginative powers, by f eeding us stories and stopping us from our natural ability and need to actively visu ally imagine fictional stories or dreams. Western societies especially suffer from this artificially induced atrophy of their imaginative powers. So try to go back to reading exciting fiction novels, as th is will allow you to re-ignite you imagination and visualization capacities. Painting, keeping a daily journal of your experiences, writin g your own novels and stories, may also prove to be very helpful. Painters possess a great deal of visual imagination, musician have high degree of auditory imagination, sculptors exhibit tact ical imagination, and nature loving people are filled with olfactory imagination and appreciation. Practice and love the arts since they are manife stations of the Higher Divine Realms and are beneficial exercises that bring you into higher creative levels of imaginative holographic projection. Try to often exercise your sensory imagination by imagining objects or situations, with eyes closed at first, and then opened. All "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" Remote Influencing Thought and Reality Course painters do this. Try to hear music you enjoy with your mental ears. Do the sa me with the sounds of Nature; all musical composers do this. Try to imag ine touching objects or pe ople whose touch you have enjoyed; all sculptors do this. Tr y to produce in your being the sens ation of cold, warm, hunger, thirst, tiredness, energy lightness, gravity etc. Imagine sme lling the scent of various flowers, nature scents, and perfumes. Do not overstrain your self with any of the aforementioned exerci ses. Very importantly too, and capital in order to achieve a deep emotional cleansing and reprogramming, learn and try to imagine and feel various emotional states, such as dejection, acceptance, depres sion, happiness, hatred, love, anger and unconditional acceptance etc... Always experience the dark negative emotion first and then progress immediately up to its dire ct opposite. For instance, experience first the darkest desperation, and then bliss. At the beginning, imagine visually si tuations that bring or have brought about in your past these emotions, and live them. Then, only im agine reasons that would cause such emotions. Finally, only feel the emotion itse lf, without any reason, and practice switc hing quite rapidly at will from one to another just by will alone. Practice them for a maximum of 5 minutes at a tim e. Your goal is to achieve perfect emotional steadiness, strength, stability an d peace, no matter the circumstances you face. This is a great worthy and necessary step to your inner development as powerful reality Creators. Also please practice entering and adjusting to the rate of molecular vibr atory hum using 5B, 6A and 6B of the RV course. This will prepare you for merging with the portals of nature and connecting to other Humans. Practice with a tree and flowers. You are also kindly asked to please practice tape 2 A&B from the first RV course. Try to use the Sun, if you can as a source of light, otherwise point a fluorescent bulb towards your closed eyes. Try to merge with the vibrations of the Sun, for they carry much power. Practice the first course with your eyes opened, first by fixing a fixed point on the wall or anywhere else, and eventually by only defocusing your mind from its direct visual environment. Also learn to communicate with the advisors that appear in your mental lab, for they are but visual representations drawn by your own Hi gher Self. If you desire different ones with special qualities, you can choose them. You HS will abide and connect to th e pool of memory bank information that pertains to the domains you are curious about. Most importa ntly, get used to communicating with your HS. In reality, this visual representa tion is but a trick. Since most individuals have less problems communicating in thoughts with entities, they can vi sually imagine and therefore perceive as being external to them, (which is not the real case) than communicatin g directly with themselves and wondering if they are \"imagining\" the responses. Y ou can use your mental lab to drop immediately in deep Theta even while conversing with someone else . Your advisors can often be used in order to check the veracity of what someone is telling you, since they (your HS) can conne ct to the HS of your interlocutor. Happy thoughts and wonderful manifestations! "}]
