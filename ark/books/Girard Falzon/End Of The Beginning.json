[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The End of the Beginning Friends and free people of the Earth, welcome. Allow me the honor of disturbing your peace a bit and overturning some stagnant idols if I may; it is my greatest pleasure to turn men from their shrines and into the open air to stretch their heads a bit. I intend to confront man for all of this madness around us, and know that many breathe this freshest and most defiant air with me. We acknowledge and examine the crushing weight all around us, the encroaching existential wasteland that really is encircling mankind . It’s out there, and in us, and we know and feel it, a profoundly disturbing suspicion and dread. We know but ignore that our civilization is sleepwalking over a cliff and dragging with it essential properties of humankind. And it’s terrifying and unstoppable, so we put it out of our minds- after all, what can we really do about it? But then, we are equally aware of an emerging resistance, groggy with sleep though it may be. We have faith that man has always known exactly how to organize his affairs and maintain a benevolent accord with his environment. This knowledge is the axis of the philosophy of Liberty, an elder god that is waking and stretching through our dissatisfied consciousness. I do not wish to waste words on advocating specific policy or initiatives or government forms- I find that these details are provided for and expressed already in our holiest of monuments, the Bill of Rights. More importantly I find that specific initiatives, institutions, and policies are redundant and ephemeral; all they truly do is demonstrate a given spiritual condition among a people. They are the effects, not the causes, of Freedom. When we pick up our heads from our desks and survey the scene, it is tempting to dismiss the crisis of the modern world as “how it is,” as though this course for man is the only option. Mankind has, after all, engaged in terribly corruptive practices of ritualized and baptized enslavement of other men for around 10,000 years. There was, however, seemingly no centralized and coordinated assault on human freedom (the State) for a good 80% of our history as humankind on Earth, and we would be wise to reason out the possible causes of this. Man for the last 50,000 years has, after all, been essentially the same man, being in potential no different than anyone today. That is, while primordial man had perhaps not inherited the tools and education of 500 generations of men engineering tools, he could learn to do this as readily as we do. Still, we can look at man before the State as the foundation of future mankind;"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"while instincts and unconscious processes are \"civilized\" or sublimated or tamed or otherwise quieted, dulled, or redirected, they cannot be eliminated. Primordial man, having arisen from more sophisticated species of apes, carried in his blood the same machinery as numberless generations of his forebears, and this machinery was accustomed to employing and perpetuating itself in certain ways. Indeed this machinery had come to optimize itself to perpetuate its systems through proven and established means whose effectiveness relied in part on entrenching itself as needs in the organisms that sustained this machinery. Primordial man then was our root in that the dual demands of his blood-instinct and his environment coupled to produce progeny of a very specific nature with specific demands- our nature and our demands. This creation, like all others, developed a harmony between itself and the greater world, and this harmony was maintained by adherence to general laws. Mankind needed, for example, to feed his young and helpless children meat to give their growing weapon-brains protein. In obedience to the laws that govern all organic life, this early mankind, our mankind , wanted very much to raise children and project himself indefinitely into the future, and to do this he became an adept hunter. Like many other species of predator (cats for example) his reliance on hunting developed systems independent of the need for food; hunting became its own incentive, satisfying its own drives that could not be fed by peaceably acquired food, exactly as well-fed house cats today will still hunt and kill prey despite a reliable diet. Hunting is just one example- we can observe very clear and biological roots to aspects of man today attributed to culture, such as his tendency to pair-bond and his handling of stress, and I suggest to anyone interested in this approach to read Desmond Morris and Howard Bloom, and more importantly to examine yourself and the deepest stirrings in your unconsciousness. Feel and identify them and trace them back to their roots and utility in primordial stages of mankind’s ascension. The point of all of this is that primordial man, genetically the same man as modern man, developed (or more accurately, realized or grew into) an entire web of social systems by adhering to the mandate of his biology. He was rationalizing values and morals and behavior that already existed without the intervention of his will, as an expression of the will of the life inside him . And this will is of course within modern man, as we are genetically identical. At some point, however, Primordial man yielded to a modern incarnation of himself. He settled down. He separated himself from the world around him, psychologically with custom and religion but also tangibly, that is in stone with walls that endured. His cults dedicated to order and law entrenched themselves in"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"a given physical space. He built the State (from the Latin \"to stay\") He was no longer a wanderer or subject of the Earth. He was a force with which all other forces must reckon and a standard by which all things are judged. How might this have happened and what systems were conscripted to aid this transition? Man was and is, after all, an autonomous animal that had a powerful demand for his own mate, his own children, his own space. This is not theory and to see this we need only look at our unconscious actions- when we see a particularly attractive specimen with which to reproduce, for example, our bodies --want-- to. Our hormonal output and physiological systems have no consideration for the social consequences of our taking of a particular mate nor do they check with our lofty abstract conceptions before driving into gear. Similarly, if our space is invaded by belligerents our hormonal output and physiological systems launch into a defense of this space without reasoning or argument; we see then in our unconscious and organic responses the expressions of laws older than social ones, untrained and pure laws that demand above all things freedom to enjoy the splendor of the life within. And then came the State. It should be noted that it of course did not just arrive on the scene without an introduction or a warning; as the man of the State is genetically the same as primordial man, one emerges from the other depending on a number of conditions. The revolution of the State did not create new potentials within man but rather conscripted old ones; his urge to hunt and kill, the prominence of his ape-heritage status demands, his desire for his own individual offspring, and his tendency to surrender critical thought in moments of stress and anxiety are all very basic and deeply-rooted machines under the surface of thought, and the State grew from the feeding of these appetites and neglect of other ones. Life under the State did not alter man according to the only force before which he previously bowed, that of natural selection, but rather modified his behavior by the creation and maintenance of a general psychological condition . This general condition, the psychology of the man of the State, has been so thoroughly absorbed by the great mass of humanity that it is synonymous with being human! Such is the extent of the madness of the modern world. Modern man, the man of the State, defines history as beginning WITH THE STATE. The 50,000 or so years that man walked the Earth without the State, despite the fact that he was our genetic brother, is somehow irrelevant and has nothing to teach us about ourselves. Now this fact alone is one that many have heard but because of the penetrating effectiveness of State mythology, are yet to think upon. So let's do that now. Think on this: Man walked the Earth for tens"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"of thousands of years living in small and autonomous bands whose affairs and policy he individually affected as a consequence of his own individual opinions and actions . And, this entire narrative is erased from public dialogue, or at best a footnote. As far as our modern mythology is concerned, mankind began in Sumeria and Egypt by writing things down and building farms and walls and temples and citadels. We moderns have a patron-saint creator man-god warden deity to whom we attribute the foundation of our way of life, and it is likely that every school kid in the world knows his name, for how can the State continue to build its prisons without the first crimes of Hammurabi? So here we are today, after having lived for tens of thousands of years using our force within and among other natural forces. With the creation of the State, however, we introduced a new force, one unprecedented in the history of the earth, one that did not exist within but AGAINST natural forces. I apologize but I must digress for a moment in order to clarify an important point. When I use words like \"natural forces\" I want it to be clear that I am talking about observable and quantifiable energy applied or manifested in any which way. So, the atmosphere, temperature, our digestive system and appetite, cell growth, the magnetic pull of the moon and heat of the sun, photosynthesis, tides, these are all the natural forces of which I speak. When it comes to the State, we can conclude that it has no such natural force; where it does apply and manifest energy, it is always some other source whose identity is borrowed or stolen in being mislabeled; a farmer working his fields or a soldier killing and dying are natural forces, and yet we are quick to see these as energy of the State. Rather than express something like owners exchanging property, a natural force, the State perspective calls it The Market, placing it firmly within realms of regulation and control. This is essential to understand because it means that the State, despite the fact that it HAS NO REAL EXISTENCE and can generate, allocate, and expend NO ENERGY OF ITS OWN (only that of its loyal subjects) is treated by modern men as AN ENTITY. The state then has become god. Let's note some properties of the State according to its supplicants: 1- It is invisible- while it has power and authority to \"protect\" or otherwise claim a given structure, the structure itself is not the State. 2- It is immensely powerful- while it may not have unrestricted legal power to do as it pleases (and it does now thanks to the NeoCon coup), we the people conclude"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"daily, \"Yeah they're going to do what they want.\" Additionally the pervading ethos demands that all things should be controlled or otherwise handled to some degree by some degree of legislation and regulation. The disturbing commentary from citizens regarding the Bail-Outs should concern people here, as it became self-evident to most Americans, despite a lifetime of contrary opinions, that the government should of course directly control whole segments of the free market. 3- It is Immortal- its rule stretches back infinitely and forward eternally. Our history begins with it in Hammurabi and will not end so long as there is one. Rather than see history, for example, as the unfolding narratives of people relative to the State, moderns identify with the State's role in the historical narrative and adopt its interests as their own. 4- It is Law- It is the State that legitimizes real things of value for people. Money, for example, is not Gold or Silver or something people want anyway, but a piece of paper assuring people, \"The State says this is good. In God we trust.\" Other things such as nomenclature are subject to final legitimization by the State, and not by individuals or parties. We can see this in the State's treatment of Holidays, which despite their cause for celebration and the demands of gathering a family, the State allocates about 14 spare hours. Beyond that one is no longer celebrating the Holiday but cutting into the time demanded as productive by the State. So here we are again: the god-State, despite having no properties of its own and only being able to re-label existing energies, has fought itself to the pinnacle of human existence, protecting and legitimizing individual life because it is invisible and immortal and all-powerful. Let me be clear then that when I say \"The State\" I do not wish to attribute to it actual real actions, as it is ultimately a phantom. The label “the State” refers to the actions and opinions of very powerful individual people, who despite a position on the pyramid that allows them to see the full and historical consequences of their actions, attribute them to The State and wash themselves of responsibility. In this they (the agents of The State) have a problem with our mankind. As we are the same mankind that existed for so long without them, we have inherent needs and demands that limit the power of their system. The State by nature of its competition with other States HAS TO conscript and allocate and manage and control more and more and more of natural life until man is himself conceived and born by the State, placed in a grid designed for its maintenance, and put to work on its perpetuation. Now that is something to which we really are very close."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Look at the world around us. Man is increasingly a unit on a global mechanism, and his responsibility is not to himself but to the capable and efficient administration of interlocking systems. Indeed the renunciation of the upkeep of the grid is for many a symptom of insanity, and we can see \"treatment\" for this renunciation in the form of MIND-ALTERING DRUGS for school-children who really just are not moved to give a shit about the big machine they are being trained to work. Mankind began as an organism whose appetites and drives optimized it for prosperity in his environment, and these appetites and drives (the desire and equipment for rewarding pair-bonds, for example) evolved genetically through the gradual forces of natural selection. In an insanely abrupt period of time, mankind has created for himself a contrary system where the force acting on his appetites and drives is NOT the general ecosystem of the entire Earth, but the will and policy of Planners who rule from privileged positions atop the pyramid. Our naturally arisen drives are enemies of this system, as they serve to prevent the total control of all energy on earth, which is the ultimate aim of the cult of The State. This is a terrible and traumatizing thing to consider, because the cult of The State has obviously always wanted absolute control; we can look at any empire in history and see this drive played out, and often the urge to master the earth is part of the public platform. The thing making this era different than all others is that now, the technology exists to realize this aim. Permanently. If one generation of mankind drops the ball enough, then The State will find itself wielding the most sophisticated instruments of surveillance, information media, military and policing, medicine, education, etc. And these tools will be applied to ends consistent with the agenda of The State, namely, total and undisputed control over all matter and energy on Earth. That is, medicine will become (and is now already transformed) an industry not designed to heal illness or repair tissue, but engineer the human body to fit a given peg that fulfills a given need of the System. The Police become not a body to deal with threats to our social well-being, but a force dispatched by the State to ensure obedience and compliance of the general body of citizens. Food becomes not a commodity necessary to sustain healthy and enjoyable life, but another chemical source of alteration of the human body toward designated ends. (Who would argue this one seeing that the base of most American's food pyramid is syrup from genetically-modified government Corn?) Education becomes (or again, is becoming, has become) not the training of new generations in the accumulated wisdom of their ancestors, but the required technical training for jobs the System"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"requires, coupled with the engineered perspective on the self and its relationship to the State. That all sounds so monstrous and tyrannical and monolithic that we should just quit the fight now, but the monolithic impression is another illusion. Because we are the same men that set across the earth without a State for so long, much of our actions are the product not of State-directed channels of thought and incentive, but of ignorance of our environment and allegiance to our older drives. Thus industrialists will poison rivers that make millions ill because they are greedy and short-sighted, not because they are consciously acting as part of a broader agenda to destroy the earth or human freedom. And their actions go unpunished because the pharmaceutical companies can sell drugs to the people made ill by the industrialists, and the politicians can go with it because they can profit by the general anger and fear of a sickened and exploited populace. The point is that the system has been engineered as though forwarded by a conscious will and only works when its subordinate parts (individuals) assume an umbrella framework exists over them. But as the State is illusory, so is the direction of this global man-wrecking machine. It is composed not of cooperative and organized bodies responsible for resource management, but competing interests whose plans align against us as the coincidence of a general ignorance and greed of all involved parties. Even if the competing interests were engineered by a yet higher and unseen caste of Masters, their control over these interests is entirely built on our own unwillingness to account for their presence. So where does man go from here? He is at a unique place in his history, because never before has the god-like technical capacity existed to fully realize his most fantastic imagined applications of his power. If we accept this fact (and we might by simply looking at the tools men might wield), then the fact that the man of the State is suffering from an illness is very evident; his imagination and values are so twisted that despite the fact that he can engineer genetic code, grow cellular material, generate unlimited energy, and measure and observe the most obscure activity of the human brain, he has applied this skill to only a few limited directions, all of them destructive to individual liberty and happiness and ultimately dangerous to the existence of mankind as an autonomous biological species. So here we are folks, at the end of the beginning; this man-ape endowed with the wisdom of creation is nearing the final chapter of this narrative. If we are not careful and do not learn from ourselves and from history, we will use our"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"accumulated wisdom to war against our nature until we are planned agents of a computerized profit scheme. If we reflect on the nature of our power, however, and take responsibility for our actions on earth, then we will usurp the tools and techniques of generations of men who have trained in the accumulation of power. The Body built by the System will be re-animated and baptized in the name of Liberty. Ultimately, mankind's fate forever will be decided in the next 20-50 years. If the man of the State yields to the illusion that he must work for the systems he has created, then eventually the System WILL become a reality (advancements in Artificial Intelligence should make this a frightening possibility); it WILL consciously act and have a will of its own that determines the destiny of billions of contributing cells. If the man of the State, however, realizes that he is such in name only, that is, HE IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN SIMPLY MAN, then the spell is broken, and one will find only ghosts and echoes where there was the menacing specter of dragons."}]
