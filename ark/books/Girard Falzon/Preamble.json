[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"PREAMBLE There is a subtle, universal enthusiasm for revolution in the 21 st century. The Obama people conscripted and misled it with his Change mantra. Al Gore is hijacking it with the falsifi ed global warming crusade. As more and more are more openly victimized by the State in the new America, they must inevitably either join it and displace their frustrated power against their own citizens (and likely thereby profi t well enough), or they must accommodate more and more revolutionary sentiment. This is not empty political theory or the idle dreaming of ideologies, it is a law of the cause and effect of human relations. We will waste no more time on it, as we are ourselves already fully dedicated to the revolutionary principles of liberty. There are billions of people on the planet with their own will. There are guns and bombs and megaphones for just about all of them, and yet the global order seems to be a stable one. If we are to affect serious change in individuals, we must understand the gravity the global system employs, for truly there is behind it an invisible force measured only by its affect. We can deduce its nature by applying a focused lens to man and society. It effects man and society as black holes affect light, seizing and consuming all attempts at escape. It is a subtle force, an existential one, and as such, is not measured on a scale or table. It is nevertheless a real force that truly exerts power over human action, and it must be understood by any individual lighting the universe with the torch of liberty. We will begin by asserting that man has a sense of himself that is inviolate; that is, all men can at least conceive of liberty and feel entitled to conduct themselves as free and peaceable people without fear of violence. Self ownership is a property of humanity, an unassailable right awarded by virtue of being a person. This is our fi rst cause, and while it can be studied and understood in many different ways, as the will of God or as a territorial hunting mammalian genetic urge or as a soul, for example, we know, ultimately, that it requires no justifi cation. It has essential, fundamental value. That is Genesis in the gospel of liberty. We must pause to acknowledge that the gravity that binds a civilization is not always harmful to liberty, just as the sun's gravity enables the earth to most effi ciently convert light from the sun into conscious beings. Those of us bound happily and willingly to wives, churches or families understand this application of gravity and rejoice in it. Its limitations are the structures within our freedom. They are opposed by the crushing darkness of structures against our freedom. As human beings who have experienced the manifold gravity of our civilization, we are qualifi ed to examine and judge it. We know that in essence, it sets limits on individuals and their potential. Billions"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"of people oppose it on ethical or intellectual grounds but actively participate and buy into its crimes. We know it cannot be merely an economic system, or else the billions of people that profi t nothing by defending it would abandon or plunder it. It must not be an intellectual system, because most people have diffi culty linking 3 coherent sentences if asked to justify it. Nor is it, at least in traditional understanding, a military system, as most people who uphold it are civilians. We can say, however, with the authority of experience, that it is a coercive system. We know that it conspires and acts against the will of others, because we have faced its obstacles on our own roads and measured its power and will against our own. Surely this is nothing new in the history of man with a State. History is just the accepted narrative about the dominant groups exploiting and consolidating the subordinate groups. If we look behind us, to the past, we see that the system has always invested itself heavily in generating a sense of gravity, so that the people did not simply leave their slums and rough it in the wilderness. They remained; they stayed in their villages toiling for their lords and subjecting themselves to abuse. The law allowed for them to be set upon by dogs or whipped before an audience. Gravity was generated by fear. Through public acts of appalling terrorism, the ruling classes stamped onto the depth of their subjects' psyche a dread fear of punishment that registered in even the most archaic roots of the reptile brain. People were burned alive or boiled in oil or torn by animals. Mutilated corpses were routinely displayed, so that the very thought of resistance was associated with this terrible fate. The gravity generated by tyrants of the past was unsophisticated and savage, but effective. By normalizing heinous acts of cruelty, tyrants cast a spell of fear over the entire populace. After a childhood of watching offenders against the system die horrible public deaths, any identifi cation with these victims or their aims literally becomes a threat to the body's survival. Criminal thought was felt in the nervous system- the idea of harming an agent of the King or disrupting a government initiative was negatively experienced by individual bodies . Non-conformity itself became sin, a misunderstanding often aided by the system's priests and intellectuals. While these methods of the past succeeded in crippling the free consciousness of the people, they also had many negative side effects. Again we cite the law of cause and effect in human relationships; force applied is force resisted, and passed downward. Medieval gravity convinced the world that Jews had horns and that the world was fl at, and of course that to work and obey law was to love God, but it was an exhausting operation to coordinate with primitive communications and more regionally developed powers. The modernization of western civilization afforded new potential to would-be"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"tyrannies, but not without introducing new threats to their order. True they could send orders with greater effi ciency, and they developed machine-powered industries dedicated to ripping iron from the earth to then bury in living human bodies, but, the people against whom this force was directed were similarly empowered. A people armed in the same league as the system are not harmed frivolously; the profusion of fi rearms and broader scope of the economic world made overt repression a drama to remove from western populations and to enact in the third world, against unarmed people. Such operations also removed armed men from the competitive breeding population and directed their dangerous aggression against economically justifi able targets all over the extra-European world. Since the arming of the commoners, we see a consistent retreat of public acts of terrorism orchestrated by the State against the individual. This retreat, of course, is a stratagem designed to remove targets from the cross-hairs of would-be free militias. And yet, while we do not see hangings in the street or “Kill a Helot” day, we cannot deny that our own mankind is bound to his civilization by a similar gravity born of terror. The tyrants of today have learned much from the past. Educated by preceding historical example, they have developed tyranny to a science, and we are familiar with their various advances in weaponizing food, medicine, air, and information. As crusaders in the cult of the State, the managers of the system must dominate and organize all the human activity they can manage. As madmen for whom such power is appealing, their nature demands that the execution of this power is hostile, degrading, and harmful. As responsible managers of populations, however, they must mask their aggression or face a costly and potentially fatal armed insurrection. The system abuses and violates the public in secret, and then directs the response-aggression against politically expedient scapegoats. Since the adoption of this ruling class strategy, we have seen a continual decline in normal human forms of aggression, indeed the very thought that aggression can be healthy has been successfully pulled into the orbit of the system's gravity. At the same time, we see a proliferation of dysfunctional aggression unknown among freer people. Boys don't feebly bludgeon each other in the school yard, but they shoot classmates or join criminal gangs. Men do not assert authority over their wives, but are coached through puberty by glorifi ed pornographic violence against women. People do not defend their person or their property or their reputation with force, but the State sends you to a dungeon if you do not send them a cut of your wages. All of this is experienced and understood in the darkness of the mind behind and underneath critical, conscious analysis. The powerful, terrible specter of the State does"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"not assert itself openly in the light of the world where individuals decide their vantage and reaction and company, and instead employs hypnotic suggestions through electronic media outlets. How long must an individual watch television before he sees the State demonstrating tremendous and frightening power to harm individuals? And how long must he watch to understand what is popular and acceptable and non-threatening to these frightening specters? Those with a remote could answer honestly, “only very briefl y.” Lurking in the back of the minds of the multitude wronged by the State is a knowledge that this relationship is not right. The information has been open to the people for generations and they have ignored it to their own detriment. The complacency of their intellect demonstrates the limiting power of the gravity of the system; their bodies and unconscious have learned so completely that resisting the agenda is suicide that their fear literally paralyzes thought- the unconscious, by absorbing controlled-media depictions of the might of the State, is thoroughly convinced that opposition to the State is unhealthy. Our fellow people are unable to think clearly because the system, through manipulation of culture, is continually asserting its violent power to an unconscious, timid nervous system. To fully comprehend and appreciate this, we must assume right now, if only for the sake of this argument, that individuals have total awareness. That is, their body hair, their skin, their blood, their 5 traditional senses are all always gathering information from the environment. Their brain is similarly always computing, making conclusions about the environment based on this incoming data. A man stands somewhere, perhaps even thinking that he is paying no attention, left entirely to himself. At that moment, his hormones are being regulated by things like smells in the air or the volume and tone of distant, inaudible voices. His skeleton is shifting the burden of its weight subtly in harmony with his own blood fl ow, itself responding perhaps to a musical beat or the presence of a potential mate or threatening gestures from a rival. His posture, if he is not forcing a certain pose, is determined by judgments he is making about the individuals around him and his status and power relative to them. All of the interconnected systems and interests we call a human being are always watching and responding, and they are always being conditioned by the force around them. When we assume that man is a fully aware organism, the architecture of the system's gravity reveals itself to us in every environment; we notice that everywhere we go there are giant faces staring down at us, we see absurd rituals of subordination and terrifying threats to our welfare from all directions. We start to hear in conversation when gravity limits a certain thought. Our timid, conditioned nervous systems fi ght"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"our emerging awareness- it has always seen giant faces from billboards staring down at it. It has always seen the violent power of the State, and has regulated our moods and thoughts according to these pervasive hypnotic commands from culture. While our conscious minds can ignore or deny any data, our more archaic nervous system is profoundly affected by all of it. Action is the visible manifestation of force, which is itself the behavior of energy. Individual action then is the result of individual energy of individual bodies. When total awareness perceives its place in social life as a victim of aggression, it regulates the body's energy in line with this realization . It forces physiological changes in the body that will minimize its exposure to further or more severe aggression, while displacing it against appropriate enemies that it might in turn hurt or embarrass without fear. It capitulates. It is weakened by mere intellect, which makes more sense of more threatening data and is more aware of the severity of feared punishments; the brightest and most open minds are the most profoundly disturbed and limited by the system's subtle war against them, and they suffer existentially as any dying star must. Friends and free people of the earth, that is our dragon. The Revolution will only hinder individual agents until it strikes at the system's root. The Revolution must escape the pull of the system's gravity. Men and women must rediscover the glorious animal divine forces in themselves, forces long ago conditioned to surrender meekly or suffer terribly. The system is not upheld by any single action or single initiative. It remains because man's conception of what is possible was conditioned from his childhood by an invisible, all-pervading aggression. Our war to end war must begin by purging ourselves of this aggression. We must confront this aggression without apology and without self-pity. Feel the gravity of fear in the pit of your stomach. See the mind war's unconscious suggestions and think on their messages. Hear the system's commands in popular culture. Reveal and admonish your fear and your submission. Identify and engage the enemies of your liberation on every front- drive them from your life and your thoughts and your actions. Individuals who are aware of their own power and see the forces employed against them will require no directives. Their thought will be innocent of the global mind war's corruptions. Their actions will be fueled by new fountains of energy formerly burned away in apprehension and doubt by their ignorant nervous systems. Know that you are a marvelous innovation in the history of the universe. The Revolution is lightning in the minds of men; it tears the darkened skies and destroys the target of its focused light.
