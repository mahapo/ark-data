[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Occult War Thank you for joining me folks; hopefully you have found my ranting to be, if nothing else, tolerable and worthy of some attention. If you are still with us I would like to posit a fairly unpopular notion relatively unexplored by modern humanity. It will leave many of you running for the comforting embrace of your electron bath and soothing hypnotic sleep machine TV sets and CNN sound bytes. My premise, despite its simple logic, is a radical one and I will take you through it systematically, so as to avoid the snares of bad magical words that will make you wince and turn off your mind. Your thoughts, after all, are electricity, and this electricity can be manipulated with language- I call this principle, for lack of a better term, magical words, and we must be familiar with this idea before proceeding. Words are heard by the brain and filter through a complicated network of emotional associations. Some words are used with great restriction and thus invoke exceptional emotional states. If I said \"Pussy\" for example (pardon my vulgarity people- I loathe the word in spoken usage but I am trying to illustrate a point) its usage throughout your life has made a definite imprint on your brain. Depending on the tone of the word your system might start fluctuating and gearing for sexual deployment. Or it might take it as a threat or insult and prepare for aggression and confrontation, or as a breach of decency and blush. The point is that individual words register emotionally. They alter your heart rate and blood pressure and biochemistry so as to affect the content and clarity of thought . Think about that for a minute. It is necessary to appreciate this power before understanding the nature of my radical premise. Now, I hope you have digested it because I want to briefly look at some general human history. We are familiar with the idea that society in the past was often controlled by Priests. That is, clubs of men with closed rituals and their own secrets, sequestered from the general community, have been responsible for the allocation of resources, including human ones like sexuality, family structure, values, etc. I begin here because we accept this. It is part of a vision of mankind to which anyone with the most rudimentary education can responsibly and honestly agree. We can think of the pharaohs and Babylon and the Inquisition and such. Moving on- these priests derived their power from one of two sources; either they were genuinely in contact with supernatural entities or states OR they were clever"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"showmen and producers and effectively hoodwinked lots of regular folks into believing that was true . In either case, however, their social power was built securely on manipulation of the presentation of information, and manifested itself as a system of regulations, prescriptions, codes, mandates, morals, and values typically enshrined and sanctioned in writing, fable, or monument. These various codes served to provide the spectator congregations and body of subjects with a foundation for laws and duties by which political orders were constructed. Their codes also served to perpetuate the power of the priesthood. That is, they provided a system by which members could acquire and wield power in a way that consistently forwarded the agenda of the priesthood and integrated new talent into existing systems. Effectively, a priesthood then was a fraternity (usually but by no means exclusively of men) who employed various means to create and sustain social values. Nothing remarkable there. We can read that on any t-shirt at hot-topic or hear it from the mouth of a 12 year old that would rather not go to church. My premise diverges from popular thought at this point, because I posit that, despite the narrative of the secular modern world, we are still controlled by the Priests! Lunacy! Conspiracy theory! Separation of church and state! Hiss! Now we must clarify I suppose for the slower among us and more susceptible to the great illusion. We are defining priests honestly and responsibly here, not as anything to do with our own religious or cultural particulars. If we insisted that a priest, for example, was a man in black with a collar who gave communion and couldn't marry, we would rule out any priest on earth that wasn't catholic. So in fairness we will consider a priest any member of a circle of people with privileged information regarding the origins and values of a culture, who employs this privileged information as a means of control. In purer and freer priesthoods, this control manifests as administration over the less desirable or more charitable demands of society, the maintenance of hospitals and orphanages, for example. We must, however, remember that the history of man speaks of many dark gods and shadowy cults, and so this control could also be terrible and tyrannical and blood-soaked, like a cult of Moloch that kidnaps and tortures children to create and sustain for itself a menacing and undisputed position atop a social pyramid. In both cases and everything in between, the thing that makes a priesthood a priesthood is the closing off of knowledge from the general population and the use of that closed knowledge to advance its purpose. We should again note that the priests' primary weapon or tool is the expression of that closed knowledge , that is Language , the manipulation of words so as to give"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"them that physiological power we examined before. Christian priests, for example, cannot take the Lord's name in vain; it must be used only in connection with rituals and activity directed toward God, so that the uttering and hearing of the word registers a pious and meditative emotional response that will not stir profane impulses. We can observe several emotive, magical words in our own culture; NAZI, RADICAL, TERRORIST, COMMUNIST, and FASCIST, for example, are invoked in moments of extreme indictment, and their use is effectively our modern equivalent of HERETIC or INFIDEL! These words are examples of our Priest- speak, our culture's magic. They are memos to the people from the Temple, and just like in ancient Egypt or medieval Spain their real connotation is agreed upon in closed circles of men with privileged information- priests . And, like all magical words, they resonate emotionally and affect the content and clarity of thought by altering biochemistry. Their clever employment can guide man from suspicion and apathy to ecstasy, conformity, obedience, and faith without ever encountering resistance from conscious thought. If we have thought on these things, we are then qualified to call our own aristocrats a priesthood. We can see in their behavior the same ancient tricks, the oldest and lamest but somehow most effective tricks in history. Look at how our priests address us if you wish further clarification: we sit in a room, typically darkened, and gather in a semi-circle around a glowing box. This glowing box sits proudly on the mantle, a prominent display of our piety. So, we gather around this box and get bombarded by electrical output, usually while consuming a ritual meal, and hear the words of our prophets. Men appear on the box in clothing that indicates an untouchable and unchallengeable status over us, displaying their dominance while uttering their magic. They lull their congregation with soothing words like PROGRESS and DEMOCRACY, or they inspire us to join their crusades with appealing flags like EDUCATION or THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA or HUMANITY, and they evoke and direct our hatred with words like RADICAL ISLAM and TERRORISM. My friends, I believe there is ample evidence that we live in a theocracy. If we look at our culture from this perspective and identify the various networks of priests responsible for the creation and maintenance of our magical language, the stuff of our slogans and cliches and aphorisms, some questions will arise: if we are ruled by the priests, what god is ruling them?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Before I cast you among the wolves with that nagging question, in fairness I will share my own perspectives on how I go about determining that. In this quest I employ a rather tried and true wisdom: By their fruits, ye shall know them. If we want to see what god (or meme or idea or value or philosophy or whatever magic word your culture or clique calls the invisible thing that gives visible things meaning) the priests serve we only have to look at what they ask of us. It is after all, the nature of a priesthood to always try and acquire more control of tangible resources by means of employing their invisible ones. So, what tangible things are OUR priests after? Well, they tend to hate our bodies; their bad magic words serve to demean the value of things like naturally prepared food, for example, while they reserve their good magic words for genetically altered, hormone-treated, radiated, unnatural poison. They use bad magic words to describe proven natural remedies but use good magic words to sell harmful and addictive substances. In this regard we might say that our priests beseech us to poison ourselves and to feel good about it. They tend to hate our minds; they use good magic words to endorse failing Federal education and use bad magic words to smear people who want to teach their own kids. Despite the proliferation of information transmitting at light-speed, our priests implore us to believe and to listen, but not to investigate and explore. They tend to hate our souls; they use bad magic words to paint religion as EXTREME and FANATICAL and of course OBSOLETE, and use good magic words and popular advertising campaigns to promote apathy, despair, promiscuity, and nihilism. No doubt our priests are happiest when our soul is filled entirely with fear and tension and division, and severely displeased when we enjoy and practice tolerance, compassion, and love. What do you call the god that rules a priesthood that hates your body and your mind and your soul? I wager that whatever you call it, the current state of the world can be explained by attributing to it total command of resources and absolute power. I also bet that the world makes sense if you admit that whatever you call the thing that LOVES your body and your mind and your soul was long ago driven from the invisible citadel where priesthoods are trained. This ally of human freedom is a casualty of the Occult War, a process by which all higher expressions of humanity are smothered by the universal, immanent gravity of fear preached by our post-modern theocracy."}]
