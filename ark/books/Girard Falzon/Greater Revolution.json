[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Greater Revolution Friends and free people of the earth, we are at a crossroads in the hitherto chaotic development of our noble race. Our decisions now are perhaps the most important decisions ever made by mankind. We are aware of this, and until now our habit was to trust that the better minds in charge would take care of everything. There are people who know better than we do, with the facts right in front of them, and they say we'll be ok. It speaks well of our nature that we are trusting, that we take people on their word and expect them to live up to their promises. These are attributes of an honest people, our people, and they are a product of the faith we have in our own goodness. It has been difficult for us to break from this public trust that since childhood has faithfully arrested our doubt. Even now, it is with the pain of a young son coming to terms with his father's betrayal that we retreat from faith in the authorized thought-stream. Our exploration of alternatives to the two-party special interest masquerade is terra nova to us, an unexplored and wild continent that gives us as much cause to fear as to awe. There is much fear in us. We live in fear of tickets and cameras and bureaucrats and whatever is on the news at night. It is only now that we are realizing that we have until now called this fear “trust.” We are noticing everywhere, in all times among all peoples, the madness and the consequences of this “trust.” A numberless horde of people in the 20 th century alone murdered hundreds of millions in the spirit of this false doctrine, and built orders that to this day systematically deprive whole peoples of their humanity, and all to prop up a bio-techno-pharma- info dictatorship. Still, the light of the Information Age has inspired us to doubt; despite the better character of our honest natures, we are learning to see through the mind games played by the creators and profiteers of our culture. Our doubt melts the security of the bridge beneath our feet, and its most righteous and powerful expressions have been checked by our fear of drowning. We are learning, however, that we are aided by immortal principles as our footfalls. There are pillars that stand forever amid the chaos of the river below, noble truths of the human spirit that awaken and ascend in us even as everything else crumbles into the waters. The nature of these truths is the basis all good law and the cause of all prosperity, education, and progress anywhere on earth. These truths alone will survive when the wheel of history completes its turn in the Greater Revolution. The history of man begins with his limitless potential to master himself, his environment, and his fellow men. It ends here, now, in the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"habitual development of this limitless potential toward violence and dominance. That is the course and the conclusion of what we call history, and the momentum recognized by prophets of all creeds in all times. That is the meaning of our Revolution, which signifies no upheaval or destruction, but rather a return to the starting point - the end of the cycle in its beginning. This the era of the Greater Revolution, now- the first heralds already sound. Their trumpets educate and awaken and empower free mankind to take possession of itself. The Mechanism has overtaken the mechanic, and mankind now finds himself the subject of his created systems ; governments duly instituted have broken from the will of citizens and dominated their lives to an unwelcome degree. Tyrannies in the past were meek parodies compared to the technical power now in the hands of the global elite. The global technocracy, armed with its titanic science, looms over the earth with more power than the elder gods. We observe the Mechanism's trend through time, swallowing more and more resources, regulating more and more behavior, and understand its course. Our gaze is the long gaze, and we see ahead to the culmination of this path, to the end of mankind as an autonomous, individual, thinking being of free will. The global elite burdens the backs of the mass of humanity with greater weight, building greater monuments atop their suffering and degradation. The nature of this systematic diminution of humanity is shrouded behind curtains and encrypted with top-secret clearance. Unquestionably we observe the fatalistic domino fall of all values and institutions that preserve our human liberty, and unquestionably do we see this proceeding forward in line toward the surrender of humanity to total regulation. It may be the work of a single warped, yet exceptionally disciplined clique of men capable of sophisticated coordination of all resources. It is just as likely the accident of history, the consequence of mankind detached from his fellow men and armed with sophisticated and powerful technologies of violence. The Greater Revolution must emancipate mankind from the clutches of the Mechanism if humanity is to survive, and to do so it must abandon entanglement in the inevitable and varied Lesser Revolutions. Across the face of the globe countless flags will doubtlessly raise in defiance, and populations will respond to increasing state violence in spontaneous eruptions of frustrated aggression and resentment and vengeance. Where these flares align with the principles of true ownership of the self, they will light candles on the altar of Liberty and burn in man forever. Where these eruptions succumb to the pain and revenge of the victim classes, they will"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"only feed the Mechanism with more cause for war, more fear, more pretext, more control. The Greater Revolution is fought, therefore, above the Lesser Revolution, removed from the furious passions of men and women abused by the Mechanism's limits on their lives. These passions fuel the conflicts that lay the framework of future tyrannies, a prospect man cannot afford considering the technology future tyrants will wield. The Greater Revolution must be free of the limits of the system; thoughts and actions must not be tainted with the systematic violence against mankind of contemporary society. It is fought in the minds of men, minds freed from the tides and manias of modern social life. It is a storm that uproots everything that blocks the light of the sun. Its lightning destroys the targets of its focus. If man is to be free of the limits his systems impose, he must dare the lightning downward. He must tear down his idols and view human action in the naked light of truth. He must subordinate the chaotic remnants of national pride, of economic class, of all collective identifications, to the objective light of his reason. He must accept and experience his fellow men as his equals and as reflections of his own condition. He must not merely believe in or know this fellowship. The nature of our times, one of globally ordered political power backed by science that intrudes into every sacred domain, demands that the freest and most benevolent minds of mankind will ultimately be drawn toward the Greater Revolution. As information is more readily available, it becomes increasingly evident that violence is responsible for every ill that befalls mankind, increasingly obvious to all individuals searching for truth that their very spirit is bound in a global prison. The gravity of unconscious fear will yield in this environment to the penetration of logic. As technology and political power and culture create in mankind an increased awareness of his connection to all people on earth, his former divisions seems arbitrary and divisive. His old fears, implanted by centuries of force-backed propaganda, will evaporate in the warmth of his emerging sense of human brotherhood. His old classes will be increasingly disturbed and disrupted by economic decline, and mingled and allied with other declining classes. The social and economic bonds fashioned from prosperity and stability whither even now; his detachment from the interests of his surroundings will be natural and self-evident. The Greater Revolution is an inevitable accumulation of the best remaining human wisdom, a final rally around the perennial axis mundi , the first or last common expression of human freedom. Those on the front line of the Greater Revolution must be crucibles"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"for the best energies and actions of mankind. The Revolution is first a spiritual one, a total revolution of the individual, a complete renunciation of all artificial belief systems and redirection of all energy formerly claimed by the system. It must not waver before aggression. Its adherents are warriors; there is no compromise- all falsehoods are as enemy armies, to be chased screaming beyond their sovereign borders. They must not labor except for good, to provide goods and services desired by free people to be employed peaceably. The Revolution must be pure in body, purging itself of the toxins and lethargy of sedentary chemical civilization. It must be pure in mind, clear and empty of greed and hatred and the struggle for status. It must be pure in spirit; it will plant flowers with every footfall, sewing benevolent concord wherever it ventures. The spirit warriors of the Greater Revolution must illuminate for men the villains of history, and demonstrate through their joyous calm the splendor and dignity of life. Their efforts will free mankind of the manifold shared illusions and fantasies that pollute and wall the mind. The sleeping masses look forward with apathy or dread; their visions of the future are pale and limited, constrained by the dulling of their imagination and the unchecked resonance of hypnotic commands. Our vision, however, is remarkably clear; it was focused and nurtured by a profoundly disturbed psyche grown sharply critical behind enemy lines. We see the great turning of the wheel of history, the millennia long march of man's aggression and hatred over the corpses of his reason and love. We have looked in microscopes and telescopes and spectrometers backwards at mankind and into mankind and his struggle. Our historians have examined with skilled hindsight the failure of past systems and the tactics employed against human liberty. Our biologists and anthropologists have intimated to mankind the nature of human nature. Our physicists have discovered energy sources for all of man's endeavors and empowered even our thought to cross the world at the speed of light with the touch of buttons. Mankind now wields the power and knowledge of his oldest conceptions of god, and yet employs it only toward warfare, surveillance, oppression, and theft. This is the nadir of history, the point at which the body has totally overtaken the spirit. Our created systems have grown to monstrous proportions and have overtaken their creators, assuming for themselves the functions of justice and authority. Everywhere behind us is filled with chaos and accidents; we slander our history as the coordinated march of guns, germs, and steel, a march that has built around us an intricate and unfathomable prison-web for the mind and the imagination. Man has forgotten how to apply his vision to his science and his science to"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"his vision, and as a consequence has advanced his knowledge in blindness, ignorant to the effects on his life and the gradual, inevitable tightening of control systems around his neck. Our mankind is charged with the reinvigoration of the body of mankind. Humanity is drained and squandered by toil, fear, and deprivation, by the subordination of the human spirit to the demands of the Mechanism's industrial body. The Greater Revolution is lightning in the minds of men, and will awaken them to a new spirit, unprecedented in the history of life on earth. Free mankind's shared, accumulated wisdom can form from the accidental chaos of historical man a new humanity, coordinated not by a central system of control but by the benevolence and power of his respective, individual free natures. Existing technology can create a paradise for the individual spirit and the ideal climate for development of human consciousness. What technology does not cure disease or send messages or cause pleasure or joy will be discarded by the future generations of liberated mankind. The fires in the spirit lit by the Greater Revolution will form a new soul for the global body- what was a TerrorTheftMurder Machine will be re-animated and bathed in the light of the awakened consciousness of a free mankind. The global body will be reclaimed and will again be the instrument by which the spirit works its will, as it was for man when he first gazed heavenward and pondered his humanity. The Greater Revolution returns us to this state of limitless potential. We would be hard-pressed to even recognize the free man of the future, let alone characterize him. The liberation of our energies from thieving systems of control will fuel a global renaissance in all things- all technology, all investigation and study and activity, will be removed from the Mechanism and produced, secured and allocated by free people everywhere. It will be invested by individuals in their own betterment and their own elevation, a struggle in which they will laugh and rejoice to the betterment of all life.   "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Founding Fathers America faces a critical mass of distress and distrust. The nobler part of our nature, the part that stands between murderers and children, has sought in vain an authority that can demand of us this nature. We have given up whatever meager faith we may have had in our governments. We have watched our communities fragment and retreat from our lives. Even our family life is diminished by the taxing toil necessary to keep pace with modern life. There are still many yay-sayers and the cheerful exceptions they note are in fact a comfort to us, though we alone seem to notice the clouds on the horizon that threaten them, our last kernels of joy and freedom. The parasite in our national blood has weakened every institution. The energy it robs deprives us of prosperity, of autonomy, of confidence, and of faith. No flag or rally cry or strongman can stand firm against this tide; all are filthy with the rot and weakened with the illness of the conditions of our age. The chaos symphony of pop-culture and city-sounds and scripted conversations makes the very air hum with distraction and doubt. The ceaseless insistence of this din blankets all other tones of thought. And we forget many a lullaby and fight-song. The degraded condition of our culture pushes us to doubt; we are universally displeased, but universally frustrated. We have no outlets for this displeasure, no remedy for these ills. None among us seem worthy of the mantle of this struggle. It is in this hour of our darkest perfidy that we must look to the monuments of our forefathers, for we are truly their descendants. In our balkanized contemporary identities, we neglect the center of our national identity, neglect its role in our lives. Just as the sun both lights the solar system and binds the planets around it, so too does our national axis illuminate our common values and form us into a viable and greater community. This national axis is of course, the founding principles of the American Republic. We are all bound to each other by its law and all empowered by the light of its doctrine. The American Revolution expelled from our shores a criminal enterprise that conspired to rob our countrymen of property and position. Men killed and suffered and died to free this land from such corruptions. They were victorious, and their leaders filled the old palaces as leaders always did after every uprising in human history. This time, however, no heads bowed to wear the fallen Crown. Armies were disbanded. Elections were held. Brilliant men of vision, excellent, far-seeing, benevolent and"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"powerful minds came together in the peace of their victory over tyranny and engineered a system that had hitherto only even intrigued poets and prophets, a system that would legally defend and perpetuate human liberty. In truth, the Founding Fathers offered mankind nothing new. They dreamed of no collective or utopia or social experiment or paradigm-shift. They only stepped aside, and allowed for the growth and development of mankind according to his nature. Their glory lies in their stillness, not in their activity. They built no new empire or dynasty or -ism, only a sound state that recognized each citizen's inalienable rights. The Founding Fathers stand above and outside history, because their order is our order- it is always true, and has always been, that I own myself, and that you own yourself, and that no human being, especially when surrendering his humanity to agencies of government, can intrude on our works and association. None may harm any without legal reprisal. This is the heart of the doctrine of our Founding Fathers, and remains the foundation of our government, even today, when treason is praised as courage and madness is hailed as promise. The foundational wisdom of the first American Revolution is unrecognized today by a mass of people consumed by different creeds and factions, screaming and marching at their allotted Party; the nation is no longer a community of individuals who consent to a justly created law. Americans today have lost their citizenship- they are subjects, as in the beginning, of removed overlords whose initiatives and agendas sidestep their sovereignty and vertically integrate their behavior and property into an emerging global corporate empire. America is not a mere nation in space, but a republic of the mind. The wisdom and justice of its law are lost on an ignorant population. It is no meager nation-state, but a state of being. One is American not by descent or by faith or by decree, but by oath, by recognition of human liberty and a pledge to respect it. We are free and autonomous individuals, sovereign over our own property and our own affairs. When government becomes destructive to these ends, it is our right and duty to alter or abolish it. This is the oldest and noblest truth of humanity, and by the grace of god the foundation of the law of our land. The crisis of our day is not an economic one, nor is it legal or social. The American crisis is a spiritual crisis. It is the lost and rambling lone survivor adrift at sea, deprived of the stable foundations once embodied in his law and inspired by his state of being, by his now forgotten free experience of himself as his own sovereign. It is this state which is lacking among Americans, what we might rightly call a free state. The treason of our leadership has weakened the ship of state beneath"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"our feet. Critical components have been outsourced, critical support has been undermined, and critical orders have been ignored. We are not, however, alone in the water. We hear still, underneath and behind the madness of our era, the immutable drums of our Founding Fathers. Their rhythm unifies our purpose. The nobility of their actions and the light of their truth lift us from chaos. Truly we are the sons and daughters of the Founding Fathers, dutiful heirs, grateful heirs that will advance forever the good name of our ancestry and the gravity of its mission. The best of our nature carries the flag of our Fathers forward. Indeed, even now we hear the roll of drums. Our loyalty, our piety, and our reason are compelled to rally around our national foundations, around our shared descent, around the monuments of our Fathers and the wisdom of their Law. "}]
