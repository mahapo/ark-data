There is an occult energy in the heart that comes from Tonatiuh, the Sun, and if man releases it, returning it consciously to the Sun, he becomes immortal. But to liberate this energy, sacrifice is necessary. Man must sacrifice the desires and habits that he adores, sacrifice them in himself, and turn the knife against the enemy that he carries within himself, that keeps his heart a prisoner. In recent time s men still remembered these words, but they have now forgotten their significance. They have made enemies of other men to sacrifice them and take out their hearts, believing such offerings would propitiate Tonatiuh. Such is their degeneration, such is the ir superstition. When fear unites with knowledge, terrible things are done. It is the self within ourselves that we have to sacrifice. It is our own heart that has to be torn out of the false being and offered to the light.

Discovery of “Stationary Waves” made July 3, 1899,” and recorded in detail: Observations made last night. They were such as not to be easily forgotten, for more than one reason. First of all a magnificent sight was afforded by the extraordin ary display of lightening, no less than 10 - 12 thousand discharges being witnessed inside of two hours... An instrument (rotating “coherer”) was connected to ground and a plate above ground, as in my plan of telegraphy, and a condenser was used to magnify the effects transmitted through the ground... As the storm receded the most interesting and valuable observation was made. It happened this way: the instrument was again adjusted so as to be more sensitive and to respond readily to any discharge which was see n or heard. It did so for a while, when it stopped. It was thought that the lightening was now too far and it may have been about 50 miles away. All of a sudden the instrument began to play, continuously increasing in strength, although the storm was movin g away rapidly. After some time, the indications again ceased but half an hour later the instrument began to record again. When it once more ceased the adjustment was rendered more delicate, in fact very considerably so, still the instrument failed to resp ond, but half an hour or so it again began to play and now the spring was tightened on the relay very much and still it indicated the discharges. By this time the storm had moved away far out of sight. By readjusting the instrument and setting it again so as to be very sensitive, after some time it began to play periodically. The storm was now at a distance of greater than 200 miles at least. Later in the evening repeatedly the instrument played and ceased to play in intervals nearly of half an hour althoug h most of the horizon was clear by that time. This was a wonderful and most interesting experience from a scientific point of view. It showed clearly the existence of stationary waves , for how could the observations be otherwise explained? How can these waves be stationary unless reflected and where can they be reflected from unless from the point where they started? It would be difficult to believe that they were reflected from the opposite point of the Earth’s surface, though it may be possible. But I r ather think they are reflected from the point of the cloud where the conducting path began; in this case where the lightening struck the ground would be a nodal point. It is now certain that they can be produced with an oscillator. (This is of immense impo rtance.) 1 "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 3 The discovery of the stationary terrestrial waves... [indicates] that, despite its vast extent, the entire planet can be thrown into resonant vibration like a little tuning fork; that electrical oscillations suited to its physical properties and d imensions pass through it unimpeded, in strict obedience to a simple mathematical law, has proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that the Earth, considered as a channel for conveying electrical energy... is infinitely superior to a wire or cable, however well designed. 2 Tesla’s Colorado Springs Notes recorded the complete engineering data for the construction of towers comprising a world wireless network broadcasting on low - frequency standing waves. The prototype Wardenclyffe Tower (left) 3 was completed in Sh oreham, Long Island in 1905, employing a water well to ground the tower to the water table far below. The project investment of JP Morgan was withdrawn upon reconsideration of the implications of the extreme efficiency of the apparatus in transmitting both energy and information, key commodities that Morgan could not afford to be cheaply available if he wanted to continue to profit from the war industry. In his fear of change Morgan aligned himself with the deceitful elements responsible for arson in Tesla’ s laboratory in 1895, the false attribution of the invention of radio to Marconi and the false announcement of a Nobel Prize. Further subterfuge is exposed in an unpublished chapter of the O’Neill biography entitled ‘Tesla Tries to Prevent World War Two’. O’Neill omitted crucial details from the final draft of his propaganda biography regarding the attempted theft of Tesla’s ‘Death Ray’ plasma beam technology during a $30m negotiation with British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who instead appeased 4 t he Nazis’ false promises: Tesla revealed that he had carried on negotiations with Prime Minister Chamberlain for the sale of his ray system to Great Britain for $30,000,000 on the basis of his presentation that the device would provide complete protectio n for the British Isles against any enemy approaching by sea or air, and would provide an offensive weapon to which there was no defense. He was convinced, he declared, of the sincerity of Mr. Chamberlain and his intent to adopt the device as it would hav e prevented the outbreak of the then threatening war, and would have made possible the continuation — under the duress which this weapon would have made possible — of the working agreement involving France, Germany and Britain to maintain the status quo in Eur ope. When Chamberlain failed, at the Munich conference, to retain this state of European equilibrium it was necessary to get rid of Chamberlain [who was replaced by Winston Churchill in 1940]... Tesla was greatly disappointed by the collapse of his negotiati ons with the British Government. With it there collapsed his hopes of providing a demonstration of his most recent, and, what he considered, his most important discoveries. He did not, however, dwell on the subject; beyond the single conversation he did n ot mention the matter again. He did not get another chance to finance the demonstration of these discoveries. During the period in which the negotiations were being carried on, Tesla declared, efforts had been made to steal the invention. His room had be en entered and his papers examined but the thieves, or spies, left empty handed. There was no danger, he said, that his invention could be stolen for he had at no time committed any part of it to paper. He could trust his memory to preserve every fine de tail of his investigations. This was true, he said, of all of his later major discoveries. The nature of his system makes little difference now; he has gone and has taken it with him. Perhaps, if there is any communication from beyond the veil that separ ates this life from whatever exists hereafter, Tesla may look down upon Earth’s struggling mortals and find some way of dropping a hint concerning what he accomplished; but, if the situation is such that this cannot take place, then we must await until the human race produces another Tesla. 5 "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 4 Tesla’s financial and legal interests were managed by George Scherff, Sr. (above, c.1952), whose administrative work included bookkeeping, legal filing for patents and extensive litigation regarding patent infringem ent cases. Many perils inevitably stalked the prolific inventor of over seven hundred revolutionary patents during the corporate and political espionage of the era of the World Wars. The Nazis were undoubtedly among those parties involved in the surveillan ce of his laboratories and discoveries, eager to apply his inventions to their obsession with the subversion of humanity. Herein may lay an explanation for why Tesla’s wireless power transmission and standing wave technologies have taken over one hundred y ears to become available to the public. The financial control of Tesla’s revolutionary ideas left him penniless in his old age, a manipulation so cleverly executed and obscured that it has only recently been exposed as the key component of a greater Nazi e spionage operation. In his youth, George Scherff had befriended Tesla and worked for him for the latter half of the inventor’s life. When interviewed after Tesla’s death, Scherff claimed that he began work for the scientist after the suspicious South Fift h Avenue laboratory fire of 1895, working full - time until 1905 and then one day per week thereafter. Biographer O’Neill’s inquiries were effectively stonewalled: “Scherff, tight - lipped and businesslike, cannot be induced to talk of Tesla's affairs... [and] r efuses to permit any close questions or discussion...” 6 One George Scherff, Jr. corresponded with the FBI regarding his possession of sensitive Tesla papers as late as 1954, from a residence at 149 Seacord Road in New Rochelle, NY. 7 That letter"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 5 is the l ast available record of a George Scherff, Sr. or Jr. What ever happened to this father and son who shared the same name and frequented the most advanced laboratory in the world? Tesla’s other close friends were quite vocal in their remembrance of the inven tor, especially Kenneth Sweezey, and yet the world was deprived of the key insider perspective of Tesla’s closest clerical assistant. Why? Only one photograph in public circulation records the face of George Scherff, Sr. – at the Association of Radio Engin eers banquet of 1915 (above). Tesla is seen standing tallest in the middle of the back row, while Scherff stands at the end of the same row to Tesla’s left, his hands visible at his sides. This rare image of George Scherff is shown in detail (opposite page , upper left) for comparison with two other photographs taken in the years 1937 and 1952. A close friend of the Scherff family provided the 1937 image, while the 1952 photograph was promotional material produced for the political campaign of Prescott Sheld on Bush for Senator of Connecticut. Distinct facial similarities can be easily identified in the comparative photographs of George Scherff and Prescott Bush. Among the many strong characteristics of Scherff’s face are his unusually high hairline, down - swee ping eyebrows and asymmetrical upper - lip. The height and build of George Scherff and Prescott Bush are also identical, while even their signatures show remarkable similarities. Presented for comparison with a 1918 letter from George Scherff 8 to Nikola Tesl a is the 1954 autograph of Prescott Bush 9 (opposite). Both the handwriting and the abbreviation of the first names – ‘Geo’ for George and ‘Pres’ for Prescott – are identical. Was Scherff an agent leading a double life using the alias ‘Prescott Sheldon Bush’? Significant evidence suggests that George Scherff (original German spelling: ‘Scherf’) was an illegal German immigrant in America working part - time for both the Nikola Tesla Company and as auditor for the Union Sulfur Company. Union Sulfur occupied a war ehouse in a Rockefeller - owned building operating as part of the Freemasons’ secretive umbrella of influential companies in industry and finance with the ability to place agents and provide cover for their corporate espionage activities. The earliest corpor ate records of Prescott Bush appear to be from 1924, when he was installed by George Herbert Walker as one of seven founding directors of the Union Banking Corporation. Could it be that Walker"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 6 "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 7 selected a rookie son - in - law to manage his new bank? It is more likely that the UBC position was awarded to corporate espionage agent George Scherf as a cover to establish his new elite alias – and a reward for his successful spy work in the laboratories of Nikola Tesla. This hypothesis is well supported by the c omplete absence of any record of the lives of George Scherff, Sr. or George Jr. after 1954, as well as the absence of any record or photographs of ‘Prescott Bush’ before 1924. The information age reveals all: More tantalising are [Prescott] Bush's links to the Consolidated Silesian Steel Company (CSSC), based in mineral rich Silesia on the German - Polish border. During the war, the company made use of Nazi slave labour from the concentration camps, including Auschwitz... [O]n October 20 1942 the Alien Property Custodian seized the assets of the UBC, of which Prescott Bush was a director. Having gone through the books of the bank, further seizures were made against two affiliates, the Holland - American Trading Corporation and the Seamless Steel Equipment Corporat ion. By November, the Silesian - American Company, another of Prescott Bush's ventures, had also been seized... A report issued by the Office of Alien Property Custodian (APC) in 1942 stated of the companies that \"since 1939, these (steel and mining) propertie s have been in possession of and have been operated by the German government and have undoubtedly been of considerable assistance to that country's war effort\"... In 1924, his father - in - law, a well - known St Louis investment banker, helped set him up in busin ess in New York with Averill Harriman, the wealthy son of railroad magnate E H Harriman in New York, who had gone into banking. One of the first jobs Walker gave Bush was to manage UBC. Bush was a founding member of the bank and the incorporation documents , which list him as one of seven directors, show he owned one share in UBC worth $125... Homer Jones, the chief of the APC investigation and research division sent a memo to the executive committee of APC recommending the US government vest UBC and its asset s. Jones named the directors of the bank in the memo, including Prescott Bush's name, and wrote: \"Said stock is held by the above named individuals, however, solely as nominees for the Bank voor Handel, Rotterdam, Holland, which is owned by one or more of the Thyssen family, nationals of Germany and Hungary. The 4,000 shares hereinbefore set out are therefore beneficially owned and help for the interests of enemy nationals, and are vestible by the APC,\" according to the memo from the National Archives... Jone s recommended that the assets be liquidated for the benefit of the government, but instead UBC was maintained intact and eventually returned to the American shareholders after the war. Some claim that Bush sold his share in UBC after the war for $1.5m - a huge amount of money at the time - but there is no documentary evidence to support this claim. No further action was ever taken nor was the investigation continued, despite the fact UBC was caught red - handed operating an American shell company for the Thys sen family eight months after America had entered the war and that this was the bank that had partly financed Hitler's rise to power. 10 Exposed are the details of the ‘Bush family’ fortune having been illegally generated by George Scherf Sr. using the alias Prescott Bush, spying for Hitler and profiting by his Silesian Steel Company’s use of Nazi slave labor in addition to the alleged $1.5m sale of UBC shares. However, despite the decision of chief investigator of the Office of Alien Property Custodian to se ize the assets of UBC, Nazi war - profits were silently returned to the shareholders after public attention had been diverted. Diversion techniques have since become a hallmark of counter - intelligence practices. The cover - up activities of the FBI have also b een documented by the Treasury Department, who cooperated fully in the obstruction of justice: In 1943, six months after the seizure of UBC and its related companies, a government investigator noted in a Treasury Department memo dated April 8, 1943 that th e FBI had inquired about the status of any investigation into Bush and the Harrimans. \"I gave 'a memorandum' which did not say anything about the American officers of subject,\" the investigator wrote. \"(Another investigator) wanted to know whether any sp ecific action had been taken by us with respect to them...” No further action beyond the initial seizures was ever taken, and the newly - confirmed records went unseen by the American people for six decades. 11 "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 8 How could it be that ‘Prescott Bush’s’ Nazi war pro fits were silently returned to him? How could ‘Bush’ escape his treason charges and later win the political office of Senator of Connecticut in 1954 ? How could his son and his grandson both become US Presidents despite such massive treason on public record ? Documents buried in the US National Archives include a portion of the 1934 report of the Congressional Committee Report revealing a fascist plot to assassinate FDR in a paramilitary coup that had been coordinated through a Nazi front organization call ed the American Liberty League. Retired US General Smedley Butler testified before the Committee that he was asked by JP Morgan’s agent, Gerald C. Maguire, to lead “500,000 super - soldiers... [to become] an Assistant President. ” Butler quoted Maguire: “You kn ow the American people will swallow that. We have got the newspapers. We will start a campaign that the President’s health is failing [before assassinating him]...” 12 While Butler was surprised to find that the Committee’s Report had omitted the names of the plot’s financiers, JP Morgan and Dupont among others, the Committee’s successful cover - up had been orchestrated by Nazi agent George Scherf, Sr. – as a key component of a much larger set of Nazi operations involving the manipulation of the elite sector of fascist industrial tycoons and international bankers. General Butler’s exposure of the details of the fascist coup was buried by the newspapers just as Maguire had outlined. This further confirms that, while FDR escaped assassination, a covert coup of the US government was successfully accomplished in the Nazi set - up of World War II, just as fascist power - grabs had been orchestrated in Germany and Italy. The front organizations were simply renamed in massive restructuring efforts. All of the post - World War II reorganization of the US government comprised a massive covert power transfer to the Nazis’ through the formation of the OSS, and then the CIA acting as placement agencies for a mass Nazi recruitment into key US government positions. It would only b e until the twenty - first century that the American public would be informed that ‘Prescott’ and his son were, in fact, Hitler’s elite secret agents in America. The systematic network of covert Nazi operations have exposed George Scherf as the key Nazi mole in the US government (with President Eisenhower, below) decades after his death by one of his own fellow espionage agents, a close associate of his son. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 9 In a comprehensive deathbed confession, Otto Skorzeny (below, left), the personal bodyguard of Ado lf Hitler gave a detailed account of his life - story to Erik Monty Berman 13 in 1997, who was at that time dating Otto’s daughter, named Lori F. Pyzyna. Otto Skorzeny conversed with Erik on three occasions for about five hours concerning his entire career as a Nazi special commando and subsequent CIA agent in America. Skorzeny and his family resided at 638 Fourth Avenue in Boynton Beach, Florida, using the CIA - orchestrated cover alias Edward Frank Pyzyna, a “retired carpenter” living with his wife Frances P. P yzyna and their children. Erik Berman’s Jewish heritage may have contributed to his eagerness to record and publish the shocking true history of the pre - World War II Nazi take - over of America, a fact that may have struck the dying Skorzeny as a golden oppo rtunity to expunge his guilt. Having completed his testimonial and relinquished his extensive photo collection exposing the conspiracy of the century, Otto Skorzeny died without taking any secrets with him on December 31,1999. Skorzeny’s testimony is a penetrating insider’s view of the Nazi rise to power and their subsequent secret transference to the American Bush aristocracy. Otto’s explication of his collection of personal photographs is surely one of the most intriguing tales of espionage ever told . Having been Hitler’s personal bodyguard places Otto Skorzeny in the rare category of individuals privileged to have actually witnessed and participated in key events of worldly import whose testimony and extensive photographic evidence must be made known to the world audience and thoroughly considered. We must always remember that the truth is all that exists, and all subterfuge will surely become evident in time, especially those falsehoods so firmly media - implanted into collective memory. Skorzeny provi ded a stunning series of photographs that expose the lies of history, including one image of himself as a very tall youth posing with fellow Nazi agents George H. Scherf, Jr. and his father, George Scherf, Sr. (above, right). An espionage agent’s personal photographic collection is a powerful form of evidence for self - defense and security, painstakingly maintained to provide a solid means of blackmail protection by threat of exposure. Skorzeny’s handing - over of his collection to Erik Berman was an acknowle dgement that the photographs’ value as insurance for his loved - ones would expire with him; that he could find solace in their exposition of the hidden identities and entrapment methods of his partners, who used him in kind."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 10 As one of his final guilt - cl eansing actions, Skorzeny chose to disclose his role in forming the CIA with other Nazis exported to the US through Operation Paperclip. Otto alleged that he worked extensively with Reinhard Gehlen and George H. Scherf, Jr. in these efforts. After the May 10, 1945 German ‘surrender’, Skorzeny was imprisoned at a Darmstadt POW camp (above). He ‘escaped’ on July 27, 1948 – but was actually released as planned – to found first the Office of Strategic Services and later the CIA with the vast majority of Nazi sci entists and engineers directly from Germany. What definite signs of this do we see in the US today? The Nazi discovery and use of fluoride in state - controlled water sources to pacify and confuse the public by inducing attention deficit disorder (ADD) is we ll documented and should certainly raise alarms today as Americans fight against large - scale corporate fluoridation of the nation’s water supply. Fluoride has been shown to accumulate in the pineal gland at the core of the human brain, 14 where it throws off the resonant functioning of calcite microcrystals that synchronize hemispheric interaction in the brain, 15 resulting in thought fragmentation. An FDA scam to promote a neurotoxin as a beneficial dental hygiene additive? Artificial sweeteners like Aspartame can kill? Yes. The disinformation machine of the American media today follows precisely Hitler’s philosophy of deceit: “the size of the lie is a definite factor in causing it to be believed, because the vast masses of a nation... would never credit others with the possibility of such great impudence as the complete reversal of facts... Something therefore always remains and sticks from the most imprudent of lies, a fact which all bodies and individuals concerned in the art of lying in this world know only to o well, and therefore they stop at nothing to achieve this end.\" 16 Facts have been reversed just as the Nazi swastika has been given the meaning ‘death’ by reversing the ancient Sanskrit symbol for ‘wellness’. The Sanskrit swastika is usually formed counte rclockwise. Just as darkness is defined by the absence of light, so must death symbolize itself as the inversion of life force. The Nazi weaponization of Tesla’s brilliance is another such inversion that has been exposed by the very man who confessed to hi s murder."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 11 As deeply penetrating as these disturbing allegations may be, Skorzeny’s extensive personal photo collection very clearly documents the gatherings of his espionage ring. The recounted details and corroborative research provided by Erik Berman are quite convincing and well supported by the investigative work of Don Nicoloff. 17 According to Otto Skorzeny, Nikola Tesla’s assistant George Scherf “robbed Tesla blind” and was the last person reported to have visited Tesla only four days before the dis covery of Tesla’s vacant body in his New Yorker Hotel room on the morning of January 8, 1943. In a soul - cleansing disclosure, Skorzeny retold how he and Reinhard Gehlen paid Tesla several visits in his final days and “spoke in great detail to Tesla about his most advanced technologies and then stole the blueprints of his best and most secret inventions.” Going even further, Skorzeny reported the details of how he and accomplice Reinhard Gehlen suffocated Nikola Tesla on January 6, 1943. Dustin Wallace corr oborates the statements of Skorzeny regarding Tesla’s last days in a recent biographical piece: The Yugoslav Monarchy in Exile was summoned to visit Tesla in the fall of 1942. However, Charlotte Muzar, a secretary, paid Tesla the visit. From his condition upon her arrival she felt as though he may not live through the night... It was apparent that Tesla was nearing the end of his time. By late December of 1942, Tesla began meeting with two US government agents in order to share some of his most sensitive dis coveries. These men carried away many of his documents for microfilming. 18 Further investigations unveil a pattern of deception and prior attempts on Tesla’s life linked to his (unwisely trusted) clerical assistant George Scherf, Sr. and his son George, J r. (above). Otto Skorzeny alleged that the Scherfs were fellow Nazi secret agents, the father having illegally entered the US to work for Tesla years prior, while Hitler sent George Junior to New York in 1938 to kill Tesla after stealing his secret inventi ons. Skorzeny recounted George Scherf, Jr.’s only attempt on Tesla’s life in 1939 when he drove Tesla down in a taxicab, hitting the 83 year - old inventor while he was crossing the street. George failed to kill the spry elderly scientist, although the impac t left a broken rib and bruised hip."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 12 Before the murder attempt, Tesla was often bothered in his laboratory by the petty theft of the younger Scherf, even remarking on the teenager’s invasions to friends. Apparently Tesla took the trespasses quite personal ly, for young George’s incessant meddling in the labs earned him the nickname ‘Curious George’, bestowed by Tesla as a way of mocking his intelligence. Likening the younger Scherf to a conniving monkey, Tesla retold the story of George’s invasive behavior to Margaret Rey, who later created a fictional character for children’s books with the same memorable name. The Scherf/Tesla origin of the character was undoubtedly to be a topic of much interest during the ‘Curious George’ international film debut on Fe bruary 9 th , 2006 – a topic that would never again be discussed by the books’ co - author, Alan Shalleck (below), because he was murdered on February 6 th just days before the film premiere and interviews. 19 The identity of ‘Curious’ George Scherf, Jr. was a se cret that had already been revealed years before Shalleck’s murder by one of Scherf’s Nazi cohorts, Otto Skorzeny. Interestingly, both Skorzeny and Shalleck had lived for many years in Boynton Beach, Florida, where Shalleck’s body was found in his driveway . The two men who committed the murder were unwitting agents of the CIA, whose conflicting confessions suggest they were hypnotically controlled. The limitless potential of Tesla’s inventions is rapidly changing the human experience. The synthesis of T esla’s work with ancient ayurvedic technologies will soon provide free energy to the whole world. Tesla’s underlying goals of free global wireless energy transmission shocked industrial tycoons who abandoned his projects altogether, as they exposed the fra gile hold on wealth and political control of those same industrialists. Instead of a peaceful twentieth century of shared technological prosperity, the world has lived through a traumatic century of unparalleled technological destruction. While Tesla envis ioned our hidden connection to the full spectrum of the Earth’s resonant energy, his inventions were altered for commercialization as cellphones, pagers and wi - fi networking using only a narrow bandwidth that causes cancer in users. It is a shameful irony that Nikola Tesla’s ‘transcending mechanical sense’ was twisted to the service of manipulating the collective consciousness - ‘perils too subtle to be directly perceived.’ Scherf’s cleverly executed financial manipulation and theft of Tesla’s inventions ea rned Scherf millions and left Tesla penniless in his old age, his best inventions unknown."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 13 Otto Skorzeny asserted to Erik Berman that he had personally known and worked extensively with George H. Scherf, Jr. for the greater part of his life – first within the elite Nazi espionage ring and then in the elite CIA espionage ring – a man also publicly known as George Herbert Walker Bush , the 41 st US President . The Skorzeny photographs document an entire lifetime of gatherings of Hitler’s elite group of espionag e agents, many still alive today, who infiltrated the US government to organize and oversee the massive recruitment of Nazi scientists into American institutions including the CIA, NASA and OSI. 20 Skorzeny had stated the total number of such transferees to be about 50,000 altogether. The entire Nazi rocketry team was transferred directly from underground facilities in Peenemünde, Germany to Fort Bliss, Texas, and reassembled (team photo below) to continue their work under the pseudonym NASA. Large number s of Nazi eugenics specialists and mind - control researchers were also reestablished in CIA programs. Persistent information leaks have plagued the CIA establishment and covert operations, although no scandal has yet fully exposed the Nazi agenda of the Bus h clan due to the state - run propaganda organ of the American media, and the Scherf/Bush connection remains largely unknown despite years of attention from independent news reporters, talk - radio shows and webcasts. Skorzeny’s allegations and evidence expose s the framework of the Bush/CIA espionage methods that seduced America by using Tesla’s wireless technologies to imperceptibly manipulate the masses into becoming “ automata entirely controlled by the forces of the medium being tossed about like corks on th e surface of the water, but mistaking the resultant of the impulses from the outside for free will .” 21 Erik Berman was informed by Skorzeny of the complex strategies involved in the advanced psychological warfare being conducted by the CIA to influence wor ld events using the inventions stolen from Tesla: The CIA uses stolen Tesla technology, according to Skorzeny, to spy on Americans and manipulate the weather. There are thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth that project high - intensity positively - char ged laser beams to certain areas on the Earth. These positively charged laser beams enable the New Word Order Nazis/CIA to use their stolen Tesla technology to manipulate the weather and to transmit extremely low - frequency (ELF) waves with subliminal messa ges for mind control purposes. When HAARP is active, giant space - based lasers simultaneously aim their beams to a central ‘spot’ on Earth. That ‘spot’ will then experience severe droughts, hurricanes, tornados or Earthquakes. [In the case of Hurricane Katr ina] Bush was quick to mention that it was a ‘natural disaster’... 22 This explanation of the current psychological warfare being conducted on the American public, and the world at large, is in complete adherence to the capabilities and principles laid out by Tesla in the many dramatic accounts of future events that colored his later years. The American Senate Bill S.517 ‘Weather Modification Research and Technology Transfer Act of 2005’ directly confirms this current US military technological capability. The madness of extensive atmospheric tampering is already being seeded into the mass media disinformation, in an attempt to implant the falsehood that airplane chemtrails are a fine white powder dispersed to reverse global warming by reflecting solar rays. 23 In fact,"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 14 this severe atmospheric tampering is US policy designed to work in conjunction with water fluoridation to control human consciousness by inducing dissonance at the nano - scale through combined chemical and electromagnetic invasion of the human body.

A new ly erected cellular communications tower was only 30 feet from the lookout. \"One antenna on that tower was even with our heads,\" recalls Garcia. \"We could hear high - pitched buzzing. There were also three state communications antennas mounted on the lookout , only 6 feet from wher e we walked. We climbed past them every day...\" By the end of fire season, Garcia and Jasso were so ill they were forced to retire and the lookout was closed to state personnel. Garcia, 52, is now severely disabled with fibromyalgia, autoimmune thyroiditi s and acute nerve degeneration. Medical tests confirmed broken DNA strands in her blood and abnormal tissue death in her brain... Jasso, who worked the lookout for 11 seasons, is also disabled with brain and lung damage, partial left side paralysis, muscle t remors, bone pain and DNA damage... Both women say they have been unjustly denied worker's comp and medical benefits. Their pleas for help to state and federal agencies have been fruitless.

[is] much more difficult from an economical point of view.\" 25 "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 15 Tesla had found that with ultra - low - frequency “wavelengths of 12,000 meters [interference] becom es quite insignificant and on this fortunate fact rests the future of wireless transmission of energy.” 26 It would only be decades later that the detrimental effects of high - frequency radiation like x - rays and microwaves would be discovered, and even then still erroneously considered safe for weak exposure. The most economical waves for wireless transmission were specified by Tesla to match the Earth resonances – ultra - low - frequency humming that is inaudible to most humans. A healthy human heartbeat at rest pulses a 765 - foot wavelength of 1.45 Hz. This exact wavelength defines the base length and resonant frequency of the Great Pyramid of Giza, Egypt. The ‘Third - Eye’ symbolism that once adorned the façade of the pyramid was likely destroyed by war and flood, but was recorded in antediluvian Sanskrit artifacts now documented the world over, including La Maná (below) and Cuenca, Ecuador; Sutatausa, Colombia; Burrow’s Cave, Illinois; Glozel, France and Malta. This symbolism reveals the design function of the pyra mids’ heartbeat synchronization of the pineal gland in initiates at sacred sites in worldwide alignment. Telepathy is now scientifically understood as ‘enhanced remote viewing’ enabled by the induction of acoustic resonance between the piezoelectric ca lcite microcrystals in the human pineal gland and the synthetic limestones of the Giza pyramids. Just as in the case of the Nazi reversed - swastika to mean death instead of life, the American dollar reverses the ‘Third - Eye Pyramid’ symbolism as a reflection of the technological use of fluoride, aluminum and microwave radiation poisoning to throw off pineal resonance. By understanding the shifting environmental conditions that are enhancing our collective consciousness, humanity can choose the way of telepath y using the ayurvedic geometry of the Sanskrit pyramid builders. The applied Unified Field Theory, also called Magnetic Resonance, 27 is presented by this author freely online to demonstrate the full set of physics principles by which Tesla’s resonant wirele ss systems operated, in identical fashion to the world’s geo - positioned network of ancient pyramids, megaliths and sacred sites. The wireless telepathic communication of human consciousness is inextricably woven into the planetary changes that cannot be sw ayed by any misuse of technology. Nikola Tesla’s “transcending mechanical sense” has, in the many decades since his passing, been twisted to the service of manipulating the collective consciousness – “perils too subtle to be directly perceived.” America t oday is a poisoned nation – a Nazi mass mind control experiment of genocidal proportions – perpetrated by chemical and electromagnetic attack of the human body and mind – driving humanity to extinction. The next crucial chapter presents a directly relevant portion of the research and writing of Erik M. Berman, who seized an invaluable opportunity to break the cycle of psychopathic control by publishing the true facts of the murder of Nikola Tesla and the theft of his secret inventions by Hitler’s elite espio nage agents in a successful pre - World War II covert Nazi take - over of America."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 16 References   1 Tesla N (1978) ‘Nikola Tesla: Colorado Springs Notes 1899 - 1900’ Nolit, Beograd, Yugoslavia, pp. 61 - 62 2 Tesla N (1907) ‘Tuned Lightening’ English Mechanic and World of Science — March 8, p. 108 3 Digitally restored photograph by Rex Hebert (2004) online · http://www.frank.germano.com/ tunguska.htm 4 Leibovitz C , Finkel A (1997) ‘In Our Time: The Chamberlain - Hitler Collusion’ Monthly Review Press 5 O’Neill J (2005) ‘Tesla Tries to Prevent World War Two: The Unpublished Chapter 34 from Prodigal Genius’ online · http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1944 - 00 - 00.htm 6 O’Neill J (1944) ‘Prodigal Genius, The Life of Nikola Tesla’ Ives Washburn, New York, p. 219 7 Scherff G (1954) ‘Letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’ FOIA / J.

Hitler had considered Nikola Tesla to be the incarnation of the almighty white, Aryan mythical Superman, or ‘Das Uberman’. Hitler was curious about rumors alleging that Tesla had an extremely large penis and that he had psychic powers. Adolf, being the childish, sadistic, egomaniac that he was, enjoyed most cartoons and comedians of the era, especially ‘The Three Stooges’ and the Max Fleischer cartoons ‘Popeye’ and ‘Tesla Vs. the Nazis.’ Hitler and Skorzeny were not graced by brilliance, howev er they fully recognized the genius of Nikola Tesla! In 1934, while Hitler was plotting to take over the world, Tesla was in America helping the US government protect its citizens from Nazis by creating sophisticated radar, Star Wars orbital weapons to d estroy approaching enemy missiles, and remote controlled torpedoes. Rumors had been spreading that Nikola Tesla had created a ‘Death Ray’, an antigravitic flying disc, an earthquake machine, weather modification machines, and plasma - based optical invisibil ity technology. Hitler quickly became intent on their theft and obfuscation from public awareness, his righteousness and arrogance directing his obsessive thinking. Planning with his elite youth corps of SS Nazi special agents Hitler implored, “I must have those inventions so I can take over the world.”"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 19 In 1938, Hitler initiated long - term plans for sending young SS Nazi spies to America through the Hamburg - Amerika ship line supervised by George H. Scherf, Sr., who had in previous years been working simulta neously as financial handler of Nikola Tesla and for the Rockefeller - owned Union Sulfur Company. Hitler’s deceptive planning involved key American industrialists at every stage to insure the effectiveness of the Scherf/ Bush double - identity facade by entre nching a corrupt network of high - ranking US government officials. Photographs of the Bush family prior to World War II are rarely available to the public; one of the earliest is presented below, the group posing on arrival at the Midland, Texas airstrip in 1950. From left to right are mother Barbara Pierce Bush, son George Walker Bush, father George Herbert Walker Bush, grandmother Dorothy Walker Bush and grandfather Prescott Sheldon Bush. By embedding themselves among the dynastic American industrialis t families of Samuel P. Bush and George Herbert Walker, the Scherf family effectively enshrouded themselves in American mythology while all extant records of their existence had been completely expunged in Hitler’s Germany. The careful manipulation of publ ic records and well - orchestrated propaganda including publishing myriad false - histories would be required to effectively infiltrate the power positions of the US government, yet census records for the Bush family show inconsistencies that belie false ident ities and birth information. Otto Skorzeny revealed that three American Nazis founded the Internal Revenue Service in 1933 as a private Delaware corporation for Nazi military fundraising. Skorzeny contended that the vast amounts of American tax revenues g enerated by the IRS went directly into generating the Nazi war build - up from its very inception. The bagman who took the money to Germany was George H. Scherf, Sr. alias Prescott Bush, CEO of Brown Brothers Harriman. The IRS is not part of the Bureau of In ternal Revenue – paying income tax to the IRS is not mandatory but voluntary and based on the threat of an audit and financial investigations. Being the frontman for the primary covert finance operation of the Nazi regime, George Scherf, Sr. was indeed the most valuable secret asset of the Third Reich who would work diligently for his entire life to bring about the rise of the Fourth Reich in America."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 20 Skorzeny presented his copy of this remarkable color print (enhanced below), a large group photo of Hitler ’s elite youth espionage ring at the Scherf family home around 1938, pointing himself out at the far right. He also pointed out other Nazi agents posing, including Reinhard Gehlen (front), Joseph Mengele (back) and, in German Naval uniform, Martin Bormann (far left) and George H. Scherf, Jr. (center). To the right of Scherf Jr. sits Walther Rauff and in front of him is Dorothy Walker ‘Bush’, wife of George H. Scherf, Sr. (alias Prescott Bush). Scherf Sr. himself may have taken this photograph of his family and friends at their Dölitzsch , Germany home – with his wife, son, and mother (at left, holding Bormann’s hand) – all of the males being close - knit young espionage group members. Hitler’s elite espionage ring would only expand in world influence and po wer after the illusory conclusion of World War II, that was actually an exit strategy and mass transfer operation from Nazi Germany to the United States; Gehlen would later become the Director of Intelligence at the German DVD, and Scherf, Jr. would later become the Director of Central Intelligence for the American espionage apparatus using the alias George Herbert Walker Bush. The network of covert Nazi assets among the elite American industrialists influenced the vast reformation of US government institut ions signed into law by President Truman, forming the CIA and drafting the National Security Act of 1947. Several years prior, new US government offices were created to support the revenue gathering of the Nazi IRS, coordinating the extensive multi - tiered German infiltration. A new branch of the government called the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), whose supposed job was to spy on the Nazis. Hitler now had an entire branch of the US government at his disposal. Hitler trained and, in 1938, sent young fo urteen year - old SS Nazi agent George H. Scherf, Jr. to befriend Nikola Tesla and steal his inventions for the Third Reich. 1 The young Scherf could not befriend Tesla, but relied on covert surveillance of the scientist’s activities. George informed Hitler o f Tesla’s new invention that would render an entire battleship or aircraft invisible, both to the human eye and to radar surveillance. As a deep mole in the OSS, young agent Scherf later informed Hitler of the US Navy’s secretly planned Tesla water - plasma mirage experiment on the Delaware River."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 21 The Real Philadelphia Experiment: Operation Rainbow Project In 1941, with Tesla’s direct supervision, the Navy Destroyer USS Eldridge (opposite) was wrapped with thousands of feet of cable made from whole copper p ennies bound together (the only reason for the copper penny shortage in America), linked to several high frequency generators and several of Tesla’s other patented inventions including Tesla’s Rotating Field Amplifier (RFA). “Nearly all circulating pe nnies at that time were struck in zinc - coated steel because copper and nickel were needed for the Allied war effort. Forty 1943 copper - alloy cents are known to remain in existence.” - US Mint The US Navy had many Nazi - sympathizers informing George Scherf, Jr. who tipped off Hitler to this experiment commonly referred to as the Philadelphia Experiment or Operation Rainbow Project. Agents Otto Skorzeny and Reinhard Gehlen were selected to spy on this project. They made it to the United States in a German U - b oat. When they arrived on shore they put on US Navy Officer’s uniforms to infiltrate the Naval shipyard from which the experimental vessel was intended to sail into the river invisibly using strong EM fields. They also had fake identification. With a litt le bit of persuasive talking and help from US Navy Nazi sympathizers, George H.W. Bush and Dr. John G. Trump, they both easily made it onto the Philadelphia Naval Yard base, to an empty ship with no name that was being overhauled, right next to where the U SS Eldridge was birthed. From their obscure vantage point they had a clear view of what was taking place. The Eldridge sailed out into the Delaware River and began to glow a bright greenish color at first, then a little yellow, finally it looked very blurr y like a heat mirage or gasoline evaporating, and then it almost vanished completely from our sight. However, we were able to see the large wake it was leaving behind as it sailed south down the river. We could see it fade in and out several times until it was too far away. About six hours later the Eldridge returned to the Philadelphia Naval Yard in a state of complete pandemonium. We heard men screaming and complaining that they felt as is they were on fire. Someone mentioned that he could not believe tha t they made it to the Norfolk, Virginia Naval Base and back in only a few hours. At that point we knew that Tesla had invented, and was very close to perfecting the ultimate weapon of war – optical invisibility. Hitler was very pleased with what we told h im about Tesla’s great invention of optical invisibility. The Navy wanted Tesla to help them try out a new, more powerful high - frequency generator to increase the electromagnetic illusion of invisibility. Tesla refused to help the Navy a second time becaus e the first Project Rainbow invisibility experiment had hurt so many of the guinea - pig crew who were topside during the experiment. The sailors below decks were not affected as much;"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 22 their brains were debilitated by radiation. Most of those sailors sur vived with minor brain damage and spent a long time in the Philadelphia Naval Yards’ Psychiatric Hospital. If the sailors ever remembered what had happened to them during the experiment their allegations were immediately dismissed as ‘crazy talk’. The US N avy used fear and intimidation to silence the witnesses and unwitting participants of the experiments by threat of cancelled pensions, treason indictments and ultimately death. 2 During 1942, Hitler desperately wanted to rule the world. He ordered George H . Scherf, Jr. (aka George H.W. Bush) to wiretap Tesla’s phone to find out about what other magnificent inventions he was creating that could aid in his global conquest. Bush eavesdropped on several negotiations between Tesla and the Navy regarding his supe rvision of a second experiment aboard the USS Eldridge. After several refusals from Tesla, the Navy contacted Albert Einstein, Marconi, Townsend Brown, Dr. John G. Trump and a few less - known scientists to attempt another invisibility experiment. Einstein f latly announced to the entire group: “Nikola Tesla’s theories of magnetic resonance and optical invisibility are beyond my grasp.” Skorzeny and Gehlen were informed by Scherf Jr. of the location of the next invisibility experiment and were able to orchestr ate more help from Nazi - sympathizers in the US Navy. Pretending to be scientists Dr. Reinhard and Dr. Franklin Reno, the two men easily bluffed their way into the Philadelphia Naval Yard and the USS Eldridge. Gehlen and Skorzeny would try to steal the ma in electronic component of the experiment, Tesla’s Rotating Field Amplifiers. The RFAs were small black steel boxes with ventilation holes that weighed about fifty pounds each. Several high - frequency generators were daisy - chained together to the RFA, which amplified the electrical currents to extremely high voltages. These RFAs had to be connected and tuned to a certain resonant frequency that only Tesla knew. The US Navy still had Tesla’s equipment, but this time they were forced to work without Tesla’s kn owledgeable supervision and fine - tuning of the rotating EM fields to the correct frequency for the experiment to be conducted effectively and safely."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 23 The Second Invisibility Experiment of the USS Eldridge All of the equipment was reinstalled on the Eldri dge, while the RFA was instead connected to the ship by a long extension cord from the dock. There were two other RFAs standing by just incase the first one failed. The Eldridge did not leave port to conduct the experiment this time, and because Tesla woul d not supervise a second experiment nor fine - tune the generators the experiment did not go as planned. The other scientists could not figure out how to properly hook up all of the generators nor could they figure out how to connect and fine - tune the RFA. T hey rigged it all together haphazardly and threw the power switch. Nothing happened. They turned up the power on the generators and still nothing happened. Eventually, the scientists reconnected the wires in a different way. Finally, something did happen! The ship started to glow green a little bit and then yellow and finally it appeared to be vanishing in a giant heat mirage right before everyone’s eyes. However, it did not vanish completely this time as it had done during the first experiment. Dr. Trump a llegedly yelled at Einstein and the other scientists to make his ship invisible! The scientists decided to turn up the generators to full capacity to “see what would happen.” The ship did in fact disappear from sight for a little while so they continue d to crank up the electricity. The unfortunate guinea - pig crewmembers (above) that were on the ship’s deck began screaming in pain and running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Some jumped overboard to escape the excruciating pain of being bur ned alive. The scientists and fake Nazi doctors ignored their screams and continued with the experiment for at least fifteen minutes. No one knew at the time that Dr. Nikola Tesla had been secretly watching the experiment. Tesla sabotaged the experiment by chopping through the extension cord with an axe, and then he disappeared into the night. Tesla’s heroic effort saved the lives of many crewmen. That is the only reason the experiment stopped when it did. This time the crew on the top deck were no more tha n puddles of flesh and bone melted to the deck. The crewmembers had their flesh and bones cooked from the inside like a giant microwave oven due to the intense heat of high - frequency magnetic fields that were not properly tuned during this second experimen t."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 24 The “flesh puddles” at first glance, looked like sailors had been fused into the deck. That was not the case. The marrow from inside their bones had been cooked and their bodies melted onto the decks. During the confusion of trying to shovel - up and dis pose of the unfortunate sailors, Skorzeny and Gehlen were able to grab all three of the Rotating Field Amplifiers. Now the US Navy did not have any RFAs left. The two Nazi thieves made their getaway without anyone suspecting a thing. This time Skorzeny had been paid by the Russians to steal the RFA for them, which he did. Now, Nazi - Germany and Russia had Tesla’s electronic invisibility technology and the United States of America did not. 3 By stealing America’s last RFAs, Nazi Germany had just “unofficially” won World War II. Thorn EMI Corporation of England and Raytheon Corporation provided the glass vacuum tubes and electronic equipment for the experiment. Raytheon was awarded patents for microwave ovens and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines that were created as commercial applications of research derived from the horrific Philadelphia Experiment. Various people have written books about the Philadelphia Experiment claiming that they were on board the Eldridge at the time or that the experiment nev er took place at all or they claimed to be involved in other US Navy paranormal tests like the Montauk Project, flying saucers et al. Jacques Valle, Carlos Allende, Al Bielek, Preston Nichols, Mac Shelton and Bob Lazar are six of these people. When I asked Skorzeny about these six men, he laughed and told me that Al Bielek is allegedly a former Nazi and “government stooge” who works for the Pentagon. Valle, Allende, Bielek, Nichols, Shelton and Lazar are all allegedly CIA disinformation spreading “bullshit artists”. Skorzeny emphatically stated “if they really knew anything about Operation Rainbow Project or flying discs, I would have been ordered to kill them as I did with Dr. Morris K. Jessup.” 4 Nikola Tesla’s Final Day In late 1942, at the age of 85, Nikola Tesla had called the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) several times to try to set up a meeting to give them his newest and greatest inventions; an antigravitic invisible flying disc, delta - winged radar - absorbing aircraft designs, a Death Ray, an E arthquake machine, free - energy devices, a Cosmic Light Ray Transmitter/Receiver, mind reading/controlling machines et al. The OSS phone number went straight to George H. Scherf Jr., SS Nazi spy (aka George H.W. Bush). George told Tesla that he would send t wo OSS officers over to meet with the scientist on January 6, 1943 to consult with him and take his inventions back to Washington DC for handling by the OSS. On January 6, 1943 Tesla received a knock on his door by two men claiming to be OSS officers. The ir alleged names were Ralph Bergstresser and Bloyce Fitzgerald. One was very tall and skinny the other was short and stocky. Tesla was very excited to see these men and offered them tea. Tesla spoke with these two government agents for more than an hour. H e showed them his complete invention plans for an antigravitic invisible flying disc, an Earthquake machine, strange designs for radar avoiding aircraft, non - polluting, free - energy driven cars, rocket ships for space travel, lasers, the first electronic co mputer, electronic mind control/mind - reading devices and a Death Ray or Tesla Cannon that fired a plasma beam to disable enemy aircraft from up to two hundred miles away leaving no trace. The range of the weapon is only limited by the curvature of the Eart h, as the plasma is beamed along a perfectly straight trajectory from the apparatus’ ray gun to its target. Tesla carefully explained his inventions to the two agents. Tesla told the men that his optically invisible flying disc had another very unique fea ture; he alleged that it was able to travel through time and to distant planets like Mars and beyond. He told them that he was very happy and proud to help the US government triumph in the war against the Nazis. The two men thanked Tesla and began gatherin g up all of his wonderful invention plans and headed towards the door. While Tesla was standing in front of the door with his back turned, the smaller man held Tesla’s arms at his side while the taller man held a pillow in front of the frail 86 year old Ni kola Tesla’s mouth and easily suffocated him to death! 5 "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 25 Because the foolish American government had forsaken Tesla, no one was there to protect and watch over him. Dr. Tesla had unknowingly given his best and greatest inventions to two SS Nazi agents who h ad been pretending to be American OSS officials. The two Nazis were none other than Otto Skorzeny and Reinhard Gehlen. By murdering Tesla and stealing his greatest inventions Nazi - Germany just “unofficially” won World War II... Allegedly, Hitler had ordered the “cowardly,” prudent George H.W. Bush to steal Tesla’s inventions and to kill him! George was “too much of a pussy” to do it, so Skorzeny and Gehlen had to kill him instead! Tesla was hit by a taxicab a few years earlier in 1938, allegedly driven by Geo rge H.W. Bush. The pre - meditated car accident injured Tesla, but did not kill him. After Skorzeny smothered Tesla, he and Gehlen broke into Tesla’s safes and stole his Last Will and Testament, Edison Medal of Honor, his Westinghouse Contract worth trillio ns today, an Earthquake machine patent model, an antigravitic flying disc patent model, a turbine, a water engine, another engine that needed no oil or gas, free - energy devices, perpetual motion devices, a Death Ray, electronic invisibility devices, mind c ontrol devices, and hundreds of love letters from Tesla’s rich, aristocratic lady - friends, most of whom were married to famous men at the time. Skorzeny claims this stolen private collection included several love letters written to Tesla from Barbara Pierc e (Bush). According to Skorzeny, Tesla’s Last Will and Testament, Edison Medal and his Westinghouse Contract are all kept in the Skull and Bones “lucky sperm club member” clubhouse located at Yale (above, right) right next to Geronimo’s skull. Prescot t Bush “grave - robbed” the skull from a sacred Apache burial ground for rituals. This clandestine meeting place for rich WASP, New World Order Republican recruitment rituals is called ‘the tomb’ for allegedly housing various stolen human bones, a coffin and a wax dummy of Hitler wearing black leather Nazi SS Gestapo boots, giving the Nazi salute with one hand and holding a gas can in the other. Allegedly, every year each new rich, WASP New World Order Republican recruit is hazed – made to strip naked and lie in a cash - filled coffin engraved with the Jewish Star of David. Motor oil is poured on top of them [and they are forced, one after another, to perform autoerotic rituals]... 6 This psychopathic behavior is a political type of reverse - Christian baptism designe d to entrap the participants into the network of coercion, extortion and blackmail. Tesla’s Body Is Discovered... The Government Cover - Up Begins On January 7, 1943 a real friend of Tesla’s stopped by to see how he was doing. His hotel bedroom door was a jar, which seemed odd. He went into Tesla’s bedroom and found him lying on his bed with his pants down to his knees, with his shoes still on, dead. After suffocating Tesla, Skorzeny claimed that he pulled Tesla’s pants down to see if the rumors about his p enis - size were true. He claims that the rumors about Tesla’s large penis were indeed true! All of Tesla’s belongings had been ransacked and pillaged. His windows were open and his safes were almost empty. His pigeons were flying around the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 26 room and walki ng on and around his dead body. Tesla’s friend tried to resuscitate him. He loosened Tesla’s collar and necktie and went to get help for Tesla, but he knew it was too late. When the authorities arrived they put Tesla on a stretcher and quickly covered him up with a blanket. Immediately thereafter, Nazi agents from the FBI and the Office of Alien Affairs proceeded to raid Tesla’s room and steal everything that was not hotel property. Tesla was not an illegal alien, but a US citizen! The Office of Alien Affai rs had no authority to steal Tesla’s remaining property! Tesla’s body was immediately cremated without an autopsy. Isn’t that strange? His ashes rest in a spherical gold urn in Belgrade’s Tesla Museum, as seen below in a performance piece by Serbian - Dutch artist Marina Abramovic. The death mask of Nikola Tesla is also presented in the Museum’s exhibition (below, right). The three murdering Nazis Skorzeny, Gehlen and George H.W. Bush attended Tesla’s funeral. The FBI published a false story telling the w orld that Tesla had died of old age in his sleep. Once again, the US government had forsaken Tesla. Why? He was the greatest inventive mind the world had ever seen and had constantly proved his loyalty to the US by inventing devices to help protect America n citizens from attacks by the Nazis and other potential threats. Why did the US government erase Tesla from our history books? To protect Bush’s secret, illegal pact with Hitler and to hide non - polluting, free energy Tesla technology from American citizen s and the whole world. Otto Skorzeny and Reinhard Gehlen took their stolen Tesla inventions back to Hitler in Berlin, Germany and to Stalin in Russia. Hitler was perfectly delighted by his agents’ successful manipulation and assassination of genius! For murdering the frail eighty - six year - old American genius Nikola Tesla, Hitler gave his two special agents metals of honor including the Knight’s Cross, the Iron Cross and promotion to top - ranking positions within the Reich. Hitler proceeded to gather up the brightest Nazi scientists along with Jewish scientist prisoners to attempt to decipher Tesla’s complex blueprints for an antigravitic invisible flying disc (developed as Vril discs), Death Ray, and Earthquake machine. The Nazis had faked Thomas Edison’s d eath years earlier to help them build weapons of mass destruction to use against America. Now the Nazis had Edison, Marconi and other famous Nazi scientists working non - stop for two years trying to build Tesla’s anti - gravity, invisible flying disc and othe r stolen Tesla technologies."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 27 For helping the Nazis, allegedly, Hitler and Prescott Bush used their influence to bribe US Patent Examiners to give credit to Marconi for inventing the radio, even though he “invented” it with seventeen of Tesla’s prior p atents. Later in 1943, it was determined that Tesla did in fact invent the radio, and credit was given back to him after his death. In 1945, Hitler, Skorzeny and Gehlen met with George HW Bush and their Nazi comrades in the US to show off “their” new wonde rful invention: the optically invisible, antigravitic flying disc. Bush and the other gathered elite espionage agents were stunned and amazed by the other - worldly capabilities of these advanced new “war toys” as they watched, for the first time, the exotic aircraft make extreme maneuvers, hover silently and vanish in an instant. Max Fleischer’s Lost 1930’s ‘Tesla Vs. the Nazis’ Cartoon In the 1930’s Max Fleischer created an anti - Nazi propaganda cartoon based on a famous scientist of the time, Dr. Nikola Tesla... In this rare CIA - banned cartoon, Nikola Tesla battles aging SS Nazis who are sending deadly substances through the mail and who are wreaking terror on US citizens while trying to create a Fourth Reich or New World Order. Tesla defeats the Nazis in the cartoon’s conclusion. Skorzeny related Hitler’s fascination and obsession with this particular Max Fleischer cartoon. He claimed that Hitler made a pact with all of his SS Nazi officers to do their best to create a Fourth Reich as scripted in the ‘Tes la Vs. the Nazis’ cartoon. This cartoon video is the CIA’s New World Order master plan for all domestic terror attacks past, present and future. 7 Max Fleischer’s grandson was born Lawrence Ari Fleischer in Pound Ridge, New York. Ari Fleischer became the o fficial spokesperson for President George W. Bush in December of 2000. As White House press secretary, Fleischer was in charge of handling media queries and disseminating information to reporters about the administration, its policies and goals. Both Fleis cher parents were committed Democrats, and admitted later that their youngest son's Republican sympathies, which emerged during his years at Middlebury College, surprised them.

They made Ari a “deal he couldn’t refuse.” Allegedly, Ari has sole possession of the licensing rights to his grandfather’s ‘Tesla Vs. the Nazis’ cartoon. He was allegedly bribed wit h five million dollars cash and a promise of life - long future employment with the Conservative New World Order Republican Reagan / Bush Family Regime, if he would make that particular cartoon video “disappear.” The plot to help the Nazi Conservative Republ icans create a New World Order in America was moving right along with the help from newly acquired Jewish propaganda spokesman Ari Fleischer. According to Skorzeny, the CIA’s former SS Nazis with help from the Brotherhood of Aryan Nations organized cri me/hate group have been planning terrorist attacks on American citizens for more than 60 years, while the US government always looked the other way, disregarded evidence and pursued fake suspects. During the last twenty - three years the Brotherhood of Aryan Nations, with help from former SS Nazi CIA employees and Ari Fleischer, systemically bought or stole every existing copy of Max Fleischer’s ‘Tesla Vs. the Nazis’ cartoon in the United States. The CIA officially banned this cartoon video like most other Te sla related subjects. Why? Because they want Tesla erased from the history books so they can continue with their plans to illegally create a New World Order in America. The Max Fleischer cartoon ‘Tesla Vs. the Nazis’ is the script for the subversive planni ng of all future Brotherhood of Aryan Nations CIA - sponsored New World Order terrorist attacks. 8 On December 12, 2000 PBS aired a well - made Tesla documentary called ‘Tesla: Master of Lightning’. During the video, a broadcast of Max Fleischer’s ‘Tesla Vs. t he Nazis’ cartoon was shown for about 60 seconds. It detailed how Tesla was able use his Death Ray to stop aging SS Nazis from mailing deadly substances and wreaking havoc on the US while they desperately tried to create a Fourth Reich or New World Order a s Hitler had ordered.

Once again, the lying CIA New World Order Nazis have deceived the American public by censoring the ‘Tesla Vs. the Nazis’ cartoon from our collective memory.

In the above satellite image, the larger circle denotes the hidden rock fa çade entrance and the smaller circle denotes the position of camouflaged guards. The secret tunnel descends more than two miles to a giant hollowed - out industrial complex below the mountain. This huge underground city/base connects Montana to Canada just n orth of the national border at the (cleverly named) International Peace Park. This underground base is where the CIA keeps its stolen Holocaust trillions and tests its most secret New World Order black projects including Tesla’s flying disc, optically invi sible aircraft and other stolen Tesla technologies. 10 Operations at the base include maintenance and deployment of stealth drones."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 30 Glacier National Park was the first national park to have railroad access at the time – a necessity for all large - scale under ground military - industrial construction. This enabled the CIA’s New World Order Nazis to transport the rumored Nazi - gold train of stolen holocaust loot from Montauk, NY to the secret base located inside the mountain. On the promontory above the secret tunn el entrance there is a strange looking outcropping of rocks that at certain times of the day looks like a grizzly bear, hence the name ‘Grizzly Peak’. The CIA uses this secret tunnel route to illegally smuggle drugs, guns, SS Nazi war criminals and dignita ries into Canada without stopping at any border crossings. 11 Because the archived surrender agreement of Nazi Germany has been forged, Canada has been hiding and supporting CIA Nazis just like America has been. Canada aligned itself with England, France and Italy in forming a secret fascist agreement with Hitler’s Nazi Germany, the results of which can be clearly seen in their unified front of complete denial of the existence of extraterrestrials and spacecraft debris found. The secret tunnel entrance to the CIA’s New World Order underground base is hidden behind a remote - controlled, movable rock - wall located in the side of the mountain on Going - to - the - Sun Road, shown in Skorzeny’s photograph above, just north of Grizzly Peak and the Weeping Wall. In the far background the Garden Wall can be seen, and at far right is the base of Haystack Butte. The tunnel entrance (shadowed overhang circled, bottom right) was cut out of the bedrock by precision laser to prevent any possible discovery.

There are hundreds of satellites orbiting the Earth that project high - intensity positively charged laser beams to certain areas on the Earth. The New Word Order Nazis’ use these beams not only as weapons, but also to transmit power to levitating aircraft, flying discs and various other stolen Tesla technologies below. The absorptive properties of the levitating aircraft allow their ut ilization of energy beamed from orbital plasma generators, optimally transmitted when the stealth aircraft are themselves plasma - cloaked for optical and radar invisibility (giving off only infrared light). A hazardous by - product of these space - based l aser beams is radon gas. Radon is said to be an invisible gas that causes cancer and leukemia in humans and animals, but if you ask the US government about radon gas you will not get a straight answer! Native Americans on the nearby Blackfoot Reservation h ave suffered from extremely high rates of cancer and leukemia since the 1950s. The US government says that nothing is wrong and there is no reason to be concerned, yet suffering communities must be informed of the true cause of their severe ailments. Skorz eny claims that the SR - 71 Blackbird, B - 2 Stealth Bomber planes and antigravity flying discs are constantly hovering just below 200’ in the skies above Glacier National Park and the Blackfoot Indian Reservation. This explains why commercial flights are forb idden to fly below 200’ in Glacier National Park; and why no one is allowed to bring firearms into the park for protection against the aggressions of the resident grizzly bears. Skorzeny claims that there are many more secret CIA New World Order Nazi bas es at other National Parks around the country, including the Grand Canyon. These planes are optically invisible and make no audible sound at all. The SR - 71 et al. are periodically brought in to the secret underground hangers located in the hollowed - out mou ntain below Grizzly Peak on Going - to - the - Sun Road. These levitating airplanes are slowly lowered into the waters of Lake McDonald in Glacier National Park, seen above. The planes are capable of traveling underwater like submarines for short distances. Once the planes are submerged in Lake McDonald they travel to the underground/ underwater hangers inside the hollowed - out mountain. Once inside the underground hangers the planes are serviced. There is a giant"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 32 elevator inside the mountain that brings the plane s up to a full - size hidden runway inside the mountain. During the night, when Going - to - the - Sun Road is closed, a large camouflaged section of the mountain is briefly opened for aircraft to exit the facility. Once the plane has left the mountain base, the s ecret runway bay doors are closed. Otto Skorzeny presented the photograph below, taken on August 27, 1997, describing the hidden stealth technologies active around Glacier Park’s Lake McDonald. Skorzeny pointed out the flat, squared rock as being a hidden flat - panel radar array (circled), one feature among several secret installations enabling covert surveillance of the sensitive airspace. He also asserted that the disc - shaped cloud (upper left) is actually a plasma - cloaked stealth disc aircraft silentl y hovering above the CIA boat. Photos of cloud - enveloped discs are well known in UFO circles. The US government claims that SR - 71 Blackbirds in hangers are wet because they expand and shrink while flying thereby causing condensation build - up. That line is disinformation – stealth planes spray mists of water on themselves while flying to create the illusion of optical invisibility by interaction with the electrified aircraft shell. Water vapor is used by stealth planes to disguise the aircraft in a white - col ored artificial cloud that, when ignited, forms a plasma mirage envelope for complete optical cloaking. To use the words of Otto Skorzeny, “the stealth planes are like flying ozone - generators.” This advanced application of HHO plasmas derived from water al lows the planes to be lowered through the waters of Lake McDonald or other lakes around the US to secret underwater/underground CIA facilities. The extensive network of Death Ray satellites in far Earth orbit are not only capable of destroying aerial or s pace - based targets and sending power to levitating spy planes, but can manipulate weather and world events in myriad ways.

When these lasers simultaneously aim their beams to a single point on Earth, the targeted area will then experience extremely severe weathe r in the form of droughts, hurricanes, tornados or Earthquakes. Spontaneous Human Combustion (SHC) occurs when these lasers are focused on the human body. HAARP is a major Arctic facility for upper atmospheric and solar - terrestrial research built at a De partment of Defense - owned site near Gakona, Alaska. Principal instruments include a high power, high - frequency phased - array radio transmitter known as the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), used to stimulate small, well - defined volumes of ionosphere. H AARP also employs an ultra - high frequency Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR), used to measure electron densities and ion temperatures, and Doppler velocities in the stimulated region and in the natural ionosphere. To further the scientific capabilities and use fulness of the IRI and ISR, HAARP is supporting the design and installation of the latest in modern geophysical research instruments, including an HF ionosonde, ELF and VLF receivers, magnetometers, riometers, LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) and optica l and infrared spectrometers. As early as 1901, Tesla had been granted several patents for these same auroral stimulation technologies. In 1983, New World Order Reagan - appointed US Patent Examiners were bribed. Disregarding Tesla’s prior patents, the Exami ners illegally reissued the patent to the Eastman Corporation for the exact same HAARP technology that Tesla had invented over eighty years prior! The mind control capabilities of ULF waves were discovered during a rash of suicides in Medford, Oregon i n the early 1970s. University of North Carolina’s head of toxicology Dr. David Fraser assembled a team who detected ULF waves emanating from a US Air Force Base near Medford (now closed), altering biochemistry to induce severe depression and psychological volatility in the population at large, thereby increasing regional suicide rates. The researchers questioned the base commander who implicated the Russians, then the following day the signals ceased, and later still Fraser and his team were forced into sil ence by death threats from several CIA agents. 12 Permanent ultra low - frequency mind control installations have been built beneath Colorado’s new Denver International Airport, while Masonic dedications and symbolism adorn the entire airport with runways laid out in the pattern of a Nazi swastika clearly visible from the air (above, left). The subterranean facility below the airport has been constructed using giant wave - contoured steel beams designed specifically for the purpose of manipulating human conscious ness via infrasound. On June 18, 2002 the ULF output of standing waves from the Denver Int’l Airport was of sufficient amplitude to be recorded by Doppler radar as concentric circles (at 16:33 UTC, presented above, right). 13 On February 16, 2007, infrasound resonance at the DIA shattered 13 airplane windshields. 14 Crucial facts rule out cold, wind and flying debris as possible causes - no debris was seen by any of the pilots, and the various airplanes were damaged in the air, on the DIA runway and at the term inal gates – all during a narrow timeframe."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 34 The Aurora Aircraft and ‘Donuts - on - a - Rope’ Contrail The Aurora spy plane (artist’s concept above) is the successor to the SR - 71 Blackbird and the A - 12. According to Skorzeny, the Aurora and other stealth plan es become optically invisible just by pushing a button. He provided a photograph of the Aurora’s unique ‘donuts - on - a - rope’ contrail produced by a pulse - detonation wave engine and four to six jet engines (Skorzeny’s photo below). When the pulse - detonation w ave engine is engaged at Mach 1.5, it further propels the craft to speeds of over Mach 6 enabling it to leave the Earth’s atmosphere to release satellites or reach any target in mere minutes. The CIA uses the Aurora for surveillance and special missions, a nd to illegally disperse toxic particulate agents, especially barium and aluminum, in NATO airspace without public awareness. When the deadly bio - warfare agents are sprayed from the craft, a chemtrail (chemical condensation trail) is left in the sky behind the craft that, over the following several days of precipitation, falls to the ground below poisoning the wildlife and human residents in a swath widely dispersed by powerful high - altitude winds. "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 35 In clear skies a few days before large incoming stor m - fronts, vast networks of chemtrails are dispersed (as seen in the 10/14/04 NASA infrared image above) 15 to facilitate CIA Nazi control. This massive, coordinated spraying effort has a two - stage effect of allowing days of enhanced atmospheric EM beam propa gation conditions before the toxic aluminum and radioactive barium are brought down to expose the entire populace to high levels of radiation, nanobacteria and viri by rainfall. By this complex process of atmospheric tampering that is an act of war on ever y living being, the CIA causes the widely publicized ‘annual flu pandemics’ around the world to the benefit of the Nazi - dominated pharmaceutical industry. This drives billion dollar profits each year in neurotoxic product scams like Tamiflu et al., in addi tion to government contracts for toxic vaccines now even administered to children at gunpoint. The criss - cross pattern of linking chemtrails enhances the EM atmospheric conditions to support the generation of HHO plasma by the superheating of water vapor . Airborne particulate metals enhance the effect of directed energy weapons for plasma beam propagation. Barium and aluminum powders are dispersed to photo - ionize by exposure to solar UV rays. Plasma is then generated by superheating the airborne metals us ing energy beamed from HAARP or any of the Tesla Ray satellites. "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 36 The glow of ‘noctilucent clouds’ is likely the effect of plasmas generated by chemtrail metals aloft in the night sky. These strange blue - glowing clouds are formed by exciting water vapor in the high atmosphere like neon gas in fluorescent light - bulbs – similar conditions are found in a vacuum tube and in the high atmosphere; the ionized metal particles bombard the water vapor, breaking molecular bonds to produce hydrogen and oxygen that ignit e as HHO plasma. High - altitude water plasmas are more easily generated on a large scale using chemtrail particulate emissions in Earth’s polar regions, known for auroral activity due to extremely strong electromagnetic interaction with solar emanations. Th e HAARP facilities are located in the northern latitudes to likewise engage the funneled solar wind input. The secondary fallout effects of the aluminum and barium have been made clear by Dr. Robert Folk’s discovery of nanobacteria, 16 an entirely new an d abundant class of infectious bacteria that proliferates throughout our lithosphere and upper atmosphere. Now known to be the most abundant of Earth’s life forms, Folk’s findings have shown that nanobacteria metabolize metals, especially binding in massiv e numbers to the airborne aluminum and barium in chemtrails before precipitating down to the groundwater in rainstorms. After the atmospheric metals have served to propagate beam weaponry, they act as a perfect delivery system for virtually undetectable in fectious nano - agents, compounding the metals’ own toxicity in the human body. Toxicologists have shown that fluoride in drinking water allows aluminum particles in the body to penetrate the blood - brain barrier and interfere with neural function. 17 Research suggests that in magnesium - deficient persons (90% of Americans), particulate aluminum is stored in the central nervous system replacing natural magnesium, resulting in the inactivation of tubulin, an enzyme crucial to nerve function. Magnesium malate is a dietary supplement that effectively blocks aluminum poisoning as it removes aluminum from the body by chelation via malic acid, while providing natural dietary magnesium. The New World Order mind - control machine will falter when the American people bring a nd end to the Nazi water fluoridation and toxic chemtrail policies. Invisible CIA Surveillance Drones from US National Parks Otto Skorzeny’s information regarding the extensive use of US national parks by the CIA in clandestine underground facilities is corroborated by public photography of advanced levitating surveillance drones over Federal and State forests. Several modular variations of hovering drones with circular hubs and radial spines have been photographed as early as 1985, near Barksdale AFB, L ouisiana. Subsequent public photographs of the antigravitic drones also surfaced in Birmingham, Alabama and areas of California in 2007 including Bakersfield, Big Basin, Capitola, Northridge, and Lake Tahoe. 18 Just as chemtrails invade all NATO countries, C IA surveillance drones have also been photographed in the UK, Netherlands, Italy, Argentina, and other NATO countries where they patrol in great numbers."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 37"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 38 These usually invisible surveillance drones are deployed and remote - controlled by operators in v arious secret underground Nazi CIA bases in US national parks, easily collecting data on all activities ‘off the grid’. Fake ‘alien scripts’ decorate the drones to disguise the crafts’ CIA origins in the event of partial malfunction or crash, by misleading observers toward the conclusion that the odd craft is an alien visitor to Earth. Temporary failure of the drone’s EM - generated HHO plasma invisibility cloak allows it to be briefly seen by the public and photographed, before vanishing only seconds later. Malfunctioning drones have surprised eyewitness photographers over both rural and urban residential areas, suggesting that CIA video surveillance of American citizens has been a regular task of these invisible plasma - cloaked drones for many years. Having been described in a few cases as hovering, slowly rotating and counter - rotating before rapidly flying away at low altitude, one would imagine that the drone’s remote operator may not have known that the plasma - cloaking of the drone had failed until the in dividuals under surveillance stared upward. Several photographs have been taken showing the drones uncloaked near utility poles and power lines, suggesting that the drones resonantly recharge themselves from available electromagnetic fields surrounding ele vated power lines (above) 19 before being able to regenerate the HHO plasma cloak and instantaneously disappear. Events of drone cloaking failure are on the rise with the intensifying electromagnetic planetary changes."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 39 According to Skorzeny, the CIA has cov ertly augmented natural caves by excavating vast chambers and interconnecting tunnel networks to create thousands of acres of hidden industrial space below ground – at the expense of the American taxpayer . They use this space to manufacture the most high - g rade marijuana, opium, cocaine and hash in the world and house hundreds of methamphetamine and ‘ecstasy’ laboratories. CIA narcotic products are trucked out of the subterranean installations in unmarked white trucks and transported to a hub facility to sel l directly to the public. The ‘Aryan hate brotherhood’ then funnels the drug profits back to its Nazi leadership. The CIA maintains its narcotics monopoly by developing extensive bribery networks; constantly laundering drug money while it legally prosecute s competitors, thereby maintaining the illusion of a functional American justice system. Patrolling Nazi/CIA stealth surveillance drones have been photographed in several different modular configurations over the years – all presenting geometric variat ions based on the same Fibonacci - ordered standing waves observed in crop circle formations made famous in England – serially reiterating the quadratic function [ z n+1 = z n 2 ]. The drone photographs from Big Basin, California included several stunning image s of a large array of conjoined circular units spanning over 16’ in diameter (above, p. 41). While genuine crop formations are created by conscious orbs of HHO plasma , Skorzeny stated that the CIA drones use Tesla’s acoustic levitation technology with st ealth invisibility cloaking using HHO plasma, seen as a fine pink/blue haze surrounding the many thin heating elements when the cloak is deactivated. The CIA goal of obfuscation of the entire crop circle phenomena is orchestrated because the geometric mess ages contained within the circles openly provides humanity with the unified key to acoustic levitation and HHO plasma technology – the exact same key that Skorzeny, Gehlen and Scherf had stolen from Nikola Tesla in 1943.

The use of bright spotlights to simulate sunlight is obvious when the surface of the actual moon is evenly lit by harsh sunlight producing long, parallel shadows.

Plasma - cloaked aerial vehicles are only invisible to the human eye, but the strong heat signature of the cloaked object is inevitably detectable by infrared. By this means it can be established that Skorzeny had incorrectly assumed Tesla to be the source of this lunar EM shielding, that is actually generated by giant artificial constructions on the moon’s dark side, as seen in secret NASA photographs that were “retouched” before public release as disinformation. I asked Skorzeny wh y he informed on his lifelong hate crime syndicate ‘brothers’. Were they not successful deceptive agents who enjoyed the bounty of a New World Order between themselves? Otto confided that his becoming an informant on the lifelong activities of his Nazi hat e group was an act of vengeance directed at revealing the true German identity of ‘George H.W.

Greed also knows no b ounds; agents of deception cannot be trusted by their own kind, who know better – ensuring that deceitful alliances inevitably go sour with the advance of ripe old age. While Otto described his resentment of repeated acts of extortion by George Scherf Jr. , journalist Don Nicoloff sites one particularly massive and highly contentious coordinated theft involving a $100 million gift to Skorzeny from his secret former lover Eva Peron, inherited upon her death on July 26, 1952: Further research about the life of Otto Skorzeny, “master spy,” reveals his little - known affair with Eva ( Evita ) Marie Duarte de Peron, wife of Argentina’s President, Juan Domingo Peron. Gold which was stolen by the Nazis ( laundered by Swiss banks and the Vatican, then smuggled to Argent ina by Admiral Wilhelm Canaris ) had accrued enormous interest after World War II, and upon her death, Eva Peron bequeathed Skorzeny $100 million, which ultimately fell into the hands of the CIA. The Nazi - CIA connection to the money was obvious. Based upon Skorzeny’s claims, this money probably fell into the hands of George H.W. Bush and his “handlers.” 23 Skorzeny told of his key role with Reinhard Gehlen behind the Rockefeller and Bush family cabal in orchestrating the decades - long setup for the illegal Na zi seizure and control of the United States of America by bribing Supreme Court Judges and installing fraudulent election software to rig the 2000 and 2004 US Presidential elections.

Rosenbaum conducted a nine - year investigation (1983 - 1992) concerning allegations o f physical torture and coercive conditioning of numerous employees at an ARCO plant in Monaca, PA. His clients, Jerry L. Dotey and Ann White, were victims of apparent radiation exposure; but as Mr. Rosenbaum probed deeper in the subsequent interview sessio ns, a “Pandora’s Box” was unveiled. His most astonishing conclusion was that Jerry Dotey and Ann White were likely the offspring of Adolf Hitler, based in part on the uncanny resemblance from photos (facial features; bone structure and size were taken into consideration). Rosenbaum also states, “They both exhibit feelings and experiences that indicate they are twins.” Dotey and White were allegedly subjected to torture of many kinds while under drug induced hypnosis, with each one undergoing at least three training techniques by plant physicians. Each victim was trained to enter into a hypnotic state upon the occurrence of specific stimuli, usually involving a “cue” word or phrase and trained to “remember to forget” what transpired in the hypnotic state. T hey were repeatedly subjected to identical stimulus - response sequence, to produce nearly automatic reactions to the particular status. MKULTRA veterans Dr. Bernard Diamond, Dr. Martin Orne and Dr. Josef Mengele regularly visited the ARCO plant, according t o Rosenbaum. The special conditioning of Dotey and White was intended for the artificial creation of dual [English and] German personalities. Rosenbaum, who is Jewish, has maintained a deep friendship with the two, despite the seemingly precarious circums tances. 26 The serial torture and enslavement described by former ACRO employees is exactly corroborated by the accounts of Otto Skorzeny, who himself was one of Hitler’s elite youth espionage corps that installed the network of corporate cover positions f or Nazi mind control research to be directly continued from where it left off in the Third Reich’s death - camps. The regimented use of fear, trauma, electric shock and hypnosis in mind control programming has been institutionalized by men who are themselves victims of horrid abuse, in Adolf Hitler’s case by his father Alois. 27 Joseph Mengele (at left, with wife and child) was employed for years using the false American alias Steven Rabel, a ‘laboratory technician’ for CIA front companies including ARCO and W. R. Grace Company. The pervasive network of Nazi CIA torture operations extends well below ground, in literally hundreds of giant subterranean facilities. These various rock - hewn complexes house advanced technologies engineered from prototypes stolen from D r. Nikola Tesla after Skorzeny had taken his life by asphyxiation.

She is a seer – a clairvoyant medium used primarily by successive CIA Directors, operating covertly under the codename ‘Oracle’. She has lived a double life against her will; as the foremost Remote Viewer for the CIA living under constant torture and the threat of death, and as a California physician residing in Costa Mesa and San Diego. Sue Ann Arrigo (b.1954) was a licensed California Medical Doctor 1 with specialized training in nephrology until leaving her CIA - cover life in 2006 in a successful move to publicize her detailed insider knowledge to avert the planned global nuclear war by ‘pre - emptive strike’. Dr. Arrigo’s profound perspective has been developed during her forty years of experience as a Remote Viewer involved in many of the most crucial and most se nsitive post - WWII US government projects since the age of nine, as a mind - controlled product of the CIA subproject MKULTRA II. Arrigo’s unique mental abilities have preserved her life through the most lethal and sadistic US government experiments and force d international espionage work. Her compelling writings present a true breadth of knowledge and a purity of heart that informs her very spiritual ethics. Dr. Arrigo’s detailed scientific explanations of the holographic mind - state quite convincingly support her astounding personal history. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Arrigo, Sue’s father, was an Army officer during WWI whose family was targeted for MKULTRA II operations being conducted in the late 1950s at the Presidio Army base in San Francisco, California ( aerial view, following page) and elsewhere in the Bay Area to this day: The main architect of the Bush administration’s legal policy, lawyer John Yoo, stated publicly that the US administration reserves the right to torture innocent children by crushing t heir testicles in the “War on Terror”. 2 The children are being tortured routinely. That is why the US administration reserves the right to torture innocent children. If we do not protect American children from such tortures, we are traitors to our country. The following are excerpts from \"Mind Control Torture Survivor at the Presidio Pre - School” (myself): My own enslavement started at age three at the San Francisco Presidio Army base where my father Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Arrigo was stationed. Children were trained [for CIA espionage] starting quite early in life because scientific research showed that children are most naturally violent, not as teenagers but between ages two – four... That Army base’s pre - school was one of at least three later found to be under the control of US military Satanists. A Defense Intelligence Psychological Operations officer Colonel Michael Aquino, a self - proclaimed Satanist, was charged with sexually abusing children at the Presidio pre - school and there was extensive pornograph ic evidence of that. However, the case evaporated after it hit the newspapers and the courts for unknown reasons. I sat down and quietly drew with crayons long straight lines of color, even, and orderly. The lady came by and asked me what I was drawing. I looked up at her to see if it was safe to tell her what the picture was, and frowned. I wanted to cry but couldn’t. I knew that I would be beaten by my father if I told her. I could feel the chill of fear up my spine. So I lied and said that they were jus t colored lines. I never told anyone the truth... [which] was much too dangerous. Those lines were the people that I had seen killed. Those lines were the people killed in front of me in the experiment to see if civilians could get to a radiation shelter and take a four year - old into one too. Now they were lines, one line per body, so that I could hide that I was drawing people. No arms, no legs, no heads — just straight rigid lines like the rigor mortis that I had last seen them in the basement. I had tried to tell my mother but she wouldn’t listen... "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 53 A tear fell onto the paper between the straight lines and I brushed it quickly away before the kind lady could see. When I looked up at her again, she had a quizzical look on her face, 'If you tell me what yo u are drawing I’ll give you a glass of orange juice' she said. I looked down again at the drawing and tried to think of what to say. Whatever I said, she would write it down and it would be thrown back to me by the mind - control doctor’s in endless repetiti ons in tapes in the pre - school nap times. Looking at the picture again, I said, “This is a yellow line. This is a red line next to it.” That afternoon at the naptime, my earphones played in a continuous loop “This is a yellow line raped by a red line. Th e yellow line is angry. The yellow line must kill the red line. Kill the red line. Kill the red line it is bad.” And I had been so careful about what I had said. I had stopped playing with the dolls. I had stopped saying, “Mommy, I want my mommy.” 3 Whil e residents in the San Francisco bay area remain largely ignorant of the mind control programs enrolling their children on a regular basis, the news media has quite effectively hidden CIA involvement in the 2007 Father’s Day family shooting in Berkeley 4 , a nd the false - conviction of mind control victim Susan Polk. 5 Sue Arrigo has defended herself by publishing her testimony in draft form online in 2006: As a coerced remote viewing asset of the US government, I was forced against my will to work for the US m ilitary - intelligence agencies, starting from childhood under CIA - DIA Operation MKULTRA II. That subproject to develop remote viewing spies involved sexually torturing children to split their minds... It is often the case that one personality of a multiple is a good remote viewer (see ‘Dissociative Identity Disorder’ by Colin Ross, MD). Additionally, it is usually possible to make the regular person amnesic for both the torture and the subsequent government controlled operations by regular repetition of horren dous trauma that the mind is unable to digest. Because I had a known and respected accuracy rating as a remote viewer at age 9 during the Cuban missile crisis, the US used me to “view” the minds of Castro and Khrushchev. After extensive debriefing on the particulars I was questioned by President Kennedy on their intentions. At age 10, I was sent to Moscow with the US negotiating team for the Limited Test Ban Treaty’s concluding negotiations. As a remote viewer with a high accuracy rating, for over forty years I have monitored WMD and engaged in critical US negotiations to regulate them, often as a person behind the scenes to figure out what terms one can actually get everyone to agree to while the negotiators haggle over the points of contention. I have b een actively involved in: Limited Test - Ban Treaty, Non - Proliferation Treaty, Biological Weapons Convention, SALT I and SALT II, and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty negotiations. Because I was a “covert asset” of the CIA, my true name was not used in any of those situations."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 54 [The Arrigo] family history of intelligence and human rights activism [runs generations deep]. In 2003, I joined the Association of Former/Current Intelligence Officers, member # 4843. My sister Jean (Maria) Arrigo is also a member. S he is currently a social psychologist writing papers to help improve ethics in the military - intelligence community. My third sister, Linda Gail Arrigo, is a sociologist who is famous in Taiwan for her courageous human rights work to restore democratic repr esentation to the Taiwanese. My mother who was a US mind controlled spy for the US government in WWII has been active in San Diego politics and was on the Mayor’s Advisory Committee on Women’s Issues... I have been a remote viewing/psychokinesis trainer of US military - intelligence officers since I was 17 years old. Most of that training was done for the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), with lesser amounts for the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and Pentagon, and the Mossad. Although I was often used dir ectly by Directors of Central Intelligence (DCIs) from Helms to Tenet as a remote viewer, I did little training of CIA officers in these skills. That was mainly because, having been tortured by the CIA since childhood I did not want to give them my skills... At the end of the Cold War the CIA loaned me to the Russian government to help them recover missing WMD and radioactive materials. So I have also trained some Russian SVR officers in skills needed to recover WMD and to correct pollution problems. In add ition, in about 1980, I spent a brief amount of time training some of Scotland Yard’s Counter - Intelligence officers in psychic tracking. The way I train officers in these skills is completely different from Ingo Swann’s method used by the StarGate milita ry remote viewing unit at Fort Detrick. I only train people in intensive residential retreats of at least a week long. The induction into the Akashic records is quick with the technique that I developed and is done in the first day. It is also a bit of a s hock to the system, like changing pressure when diving underwater. Many people have nausea, emotion labiality, and temporary physical system as their energy fields adjust. The rest of the week is spent on training them in analytic techniques to understand what they “see” in a reliable fashion while they adapt to having a mind that is no longer limited to the confines of their body. Because of my remote viewing skills I have not infrequently been a target for kidnapping by intelligence agencies wanting my s ervices. Thus I have been kidnapped several times by the KGB, at least once by the Mossad, and repeatedly by the CIA. For example, in 1993 when the US had men missing in action in Somalia, I was picked up where I was house - sitting for a local judge in Clai remont [San Diego, California] and taken to the nearby Camp Pendleton War Room to locate the missing men on a map. Other times I have been picked up to deal with accidental release of bio - warfare germs, environmental problems so severe that the US governme nt doesn’t want the scientists to know of them, etc. In the last twenty years I have worked on many of these severe environmental problems successfully. In the summer of 2004, I was the supervisor and coordinator for teams of remote viewers from the ONI and DIA tasked to solve pollution problems so severe that they could threaten the sustainability of the planet. At that time we also had ONI officers training groups of Russians in our methods with the cooperation of the Russian government. We had fourteen teams of about eight people each, with each group solving their problem in about a week. The US administration had promised to give us an agency and centrally located building in which to do this work... for the health of the planet [that] in my absence has largely fallen by the wayside... With strong faith one can solve such problems in a week with a team of eight viewers working in a residential retreat setting without contact with the outside world for that period of time... As a graduate student in mathemat ics at University of California, at San Diego, I studied Real and Complex Analysis and passed the qualifying exams at the PhD level. During that time, in about 1978, the CIA asked me to go over to the adjacent General Dynamics nuclear research facility to figure out what was wrong with their plasma generator; it had been inoperable for almost six months. That started my long - term relationship with quantum physics and reactors. Using my remote viewing skills and the mathematics of quantum physics, "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 55 Applied Fi eld Theory, I was able to quickly solve the problem of the plasma generator. After that I had many requests for my help from private nuclear companies. The CIA set up a front company to handle these requests and keep my identity secret. Mostly I was called in when all more conventional avenues of solving a problem had been exhausted, or to keep reactors working without downtime by viewing the appropriate maintenance to do in advance. The money from this work was put into a Swiss bank account via the CIA... [ reinforcing my enslavement through financial controls, as] I just do not know how to access my accounts because of the amnesia [induced by repeated torture and hypnotic suggestions]. I have done experimental physics research in cooperation with the Prince ton Engineering Anomalies Research center for many years. All that work and the resultant published papers have been under a pseudonym. My work however is distinct because I developed my own notation for Applied Field Theory. Instead of operators working o n elements of the group, the elements are “self - realizing”. That is to say that each element does what comes natural to it according to its modus operandi and there is not a dualism between operator and element. This greatly simplifies many problems and al lows quick and sometimes startling results. Those results on a theoretical level were proven in experiments at Princeton to be correct. That is not surprising, given that the world works according to how your mind conceives of it, and I designed the experi ments. I wrote a book of mathematics on Applied Field Theory using the nomenclature and notation of “self - realizing” elements. It was published by Springer - Verlung/Wiley, under an alias. [My] training as a physician [has been extensive.] I went to medical school, first year of Internal Medicine Residency, and a Nephrology Fellowship at the University of California’s Irvine Medical Center spanning 1972 - 1985... [including] a year of Internal Medicine Residency at Morristown, New Jersey combined with a year o f Occupational Medicine at Columbia University in New York City 1982 - 1983. I practiced Occupational Medicine from 1986 - 2003 and was the Medical Director of Management Health Services for almost all of those years until they went bankrupt during a long stri ke of one of their clients. Currently I hold a California Medical License G50197. Having trained in occupational medicine, with course work in toxicology, the CIA and related agencies and companies have consulted me about a number of biohazards. I also di d some research in psychic healing at Walter Reed Hospital. That led to my interest in battlefield healing which is an area of my expertise. Although killing is used in war to gain power – it is also possible to use healing to gain results that are politica lly significant. The Red Cross, of course, is a good example of that. I am also a nephrologist by training, and in that capacity I have treated one high - profile patient for the US administration twice since September of 2001. The first time was for a case of an infected peritoneal dialysis catheter with peritonitis and the second time was for a transplant rejection complicated by sepsis. [As with any undercover agent used by the CIA, military rank is contrived with each false identity used.] Having escape d to Canada in 2002, I was raped and reprogrammed to return to that enslaved condition in 2003. My orders were to report to the Pentagon for duty starting October 1, 2003. In order to cover my enslaved status and to insert me into the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) Meetings in late summer 2001 so that I could set up a Psychic Warfare Defense program for the Pentagon, the DCI Tenet had assigned me a [false identity and] rank of a one - star General K. Noble. That rank was upgraded immediately by the Pentagon to a two - star General in order to get the reforms that I recommended quickly pushed through. (Note: I was a covert CIA asset, and not a standard military person. My rank has always been at the whim of those above me and not based on any orderly progression t hrough the military, based on merit or training for war. For example, because I was training Navy Admirals in remote viewing I was given the uniform and called a rear admiral one week, while the next week I was assigned the rank of a major in order to trai n low - level Marines. My utility to the US military - intelligence - industrial complex was due to my remote viewing skills, which included psychokinesis and associated expertise.) [Torture - induced amnesia cannot completely repress the natural mnemonic proces ses that heal such mental fractures, eventually allowing coherent recall.] Most of the following material has surfaced in my mind since arriving in Geneva in February 2006, due to a conscious decision on my part to try to figure out what would be productiv e to relay of my experience to help prevent nuclear war. Because my mind was split as a child, I usually have no memory of such past events unless I make a conscious effort to write them down. The science of such “recovered memories” shows that memory is r emarkably good for the gist of events and less good for peripheral details [Brown, Scheflin, Jammond ‘Trauma, Memory and the Law: An Essential Reference...’ 6 ] "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 56 Without accompanying documents, this information stands as one eyewitness report. Because I ha ve had extensive hypnotic suggestions to recall events accurately for debriefing purposes and because my remote viewing skills tend to bleed through into even my regular personality, what I recall is often more detailed than would be expected. On the other hand, because the information is bleeding through into the regular personality that refuses usually to write down proper nouns due to the programming not to do so, most of the information on that level has been lost. What remains is the gist of the events and how the people relate to each other. As with any source, compilation with other sources is an invaluable step in judging the accuracy of the material. When I reported at the Pentagon on September 30, 2003, I was again given the rank of a two - sta r General [using the same alias, K. Noble] and told that I was to continue on as Special Advisor to JCS on Defense against Psychic Warfare. During my absence from Washington, the JCS had not replaced me with another adviser and no improvements in the Penta gon’s Defense against Psychic Warfare had been made. This concerned me as I detected several recent glaring problems in the Pentagon’s protection from remote viewing intrusions that were resulting in the loss of substantial information that directly affect ed national security. Namely, that in the last couple of months the Chinese and Russians had advanced in their remote viewing technologies and were again able to remove documents from the Pentagon, and other US agencies, by what could best be described as teleportation for want of a more accurate lay word. Although I brought this to the attention of my superiors, I was told at that time to address it next month! That meant that any document in the Pentagon could be stolen by the Chinese or the Russians in the meantime. Even after pointing that out to three members of the JCS, I was ordered instead to go immediately go to Mt. Weather, the underground radiation shelter base in Virginia, to assess, by remote viewing, the adequacy of that facility for survival in a nuclear war. It was built for the purpose of sheltering high US officials, including the President, in the event of a nuclear war. It has undergone a number of revisions over the decades, some of which I had previously been asked to comment on. In th e summer of 2001, I had thus made some recommendations regarding the air - filtering and purification system for that facility and those had been put in place in the meantime at enormous cost. But the recommendations that I had made regarding the prevention of nuclear war itself, though relatively cheap to put in place, had not been implemented. That was of great concern to me and I spent much of the next month investigating why such important issues had been swept aside while I was absent from Washington, DC . 7 Sue Arrigo has succeeded in the remarkable recollection of her memory despite the unbelievably harsh and destructive fragmentation that has been serially reinforced by CIA torture/hypnosis programmers for her entire life. Dr. Arrigo has documented rece nt torture abductions in Langley, Virginia in August of 2001 and again in August 2004; Vancouver, Canada in 2002; Nyon, Switzerland in 2006; Cork, Ireland on June 6, 2007; and near Strasbourg, France on October 30, 2007. Yet, despite this continual mental and physical enslavement, her determination to help others remains unbreakable: “Although I am willing to take stands that result in my being tortured by the US government, I do so selectively according to an internal cost - benefit analysis that others migh t not understand.” 8 By remote viewing, Arrigo can assess which US government crimes she can effectively prevent and which actions will best mitigate the"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 57 suffering of others. In returning to her enslaved condition, Arrigo has been acting in the best intere sts of humanity and indeed her own soul by attempting to prevent nuclear war from within the heart of the beast. From within the CIA, she has effectively exposed the conspiracy of lies that entrap and kill hundreds of millions of people annually in a globa l conspiracy of concurrently orchestrated genocidal wars in various regions of the world: I was on the inside of the beast that planned [the atrocities of September 11, 2001] — the US government — CIA, Pentagon, and US administration all the way to the to p. In specific, I was under orders from the Director of the CIA Tenet in August of 2001 to remove from the Pentagon all the 9/11 planning papers that might be discovered when the firefighters came in. There were too many planning papers to remove them all so they had me, a remote viewer who could see what parts of the building the firefighters would enter, do the job. Even so, the amount of 9/11 planning papers at the Pentagon that I removed filled a large moving van. It was planned over many years and man y people knew about it. Few of them have been willing to risk torture or death for speaking of it... I did object to the ‘proper authorities’ about the immorality of the US planning the deaths of innocent people in 9/11 to the best of my ability before 9/1 1. In particular, I personally voiced my moral objections in detail to my boss Tenet and to Rumsfeld as well as personally handing a written report to Bush Jr. and Cheney at the White House and to the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon stating that I b elieved it was unethical and unlikely to succeed in its goals. It did no good – the proper authorities were the ones planning it... [Only a few weeks prior to the US government attacks on their own citizens,] I was tortured by the CIA in its basement at La ngley, Virginia for my objecting so visibly within the military - intelligence community prior to 9/11, I think that I did much better than most people in pushing my objections to the fore and getting them heard. I even faxed over to the International Court at the Hague a warning — whether it got through or not I don’t know because whenever I tried to call them to find out the phone line went dead – seven times from seven different phones I tried, in late August of 2001 after I was tortured... I ask God to forgi ve me that I was not strong enough to stop this atrocity against humanity, nor the Afghan and Iraq wars that followed, killing still more innocent people. Going to the press, which I tried, many, many times, did nothing. They didn’t want the story. They still don’t... The mainstream media is controlled worldwide by five wealthy men — we are not being told the truth about 9/11... 9 "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 58 The remotely controlled 9/11 planes were equipped by an Israeli company owned by Rabbi Dov Zakheim, coordinated by Mossad through a n Israeli - owned airport security company handling the 9/11 flights. Unmistakable satellite evidence of US government execution was reported by various sources, but buried by blatant US corporate media censorship: radioactive dust produced by many ‘mini - nuc lear’ explosions below the WTC towers (the notorious ‘mini - nukes’ described by the Bush administration themselves). CIA asset Osama Bin Laden was demonized to engender western Islamophobia: I am a kidney specialist who trained at the University of Califor nia at Irvine Medical Center in 1983 - 1985 (California Medical License # G50197). I treated Bin Laden on more than one occasion since 9/11/01 for the US government who promised him safe passage out of Afghanistan and free medical care the rest of his life. He was, after all, a loyal CIA operative doing exactly what was wanted by the leaders of the New World Order. I treated him right after he was flown by helicopter from Afghanistan to Pakistan. At that time he had a peritoneal dialysis catheter infection ca using peritonitis and sepsis. Because the infection could not be cleared by antibiotics and required removal of the plastic catheter, which required surgery, I recommended that the surgery be done on board a US naval vessel. I was then flown with him by US helicopter to the ship where the surgery was done. After the successful surgery done by the ship's doctor with myself as an assistant in the procedure, I called both his mother and one of his brothers to report on his condition, as they were very worried about him. Before calling them I called the White House and spoke to Bush Jr. and Cheney both to make sure whether I should offer them the same promises as earlier. They both said yes, although Cheney was looking for a way to back out of it. There was no h int that the Bin Laden family considered Osama, my patient, to be an unwanted or discredited member of the family when I arranged for him to get a chance to visit them the next week in Saudi Arabia, where he was flown by US military transport. I next t reated Osama Bin Laden in the US. I was told by the CIA to go to Walter Reed Hospital, on July 12, 2004 (if my memory serves me on the exact date) to see him. At that time, under an assumed name held in protective isolation he was in kidney failure and nea r to death from a transplant rejection crisis and/or infection. He was exceedingly ill, but his family and he had specifically requested me to see him and in the face of his possible death the Bush administration did not want to deny the request. Because I am a remote viewer I was able to see what the problem was and addressed it by having all of his lines and catheters surgically removed while he recovered from the infection. Regardless of whether the administration used Bin Laden to foment their wars of a ggression and he cooperated with him, my duty as a Christian and a physician was to both pray for his recovery and work to assure it. After he got over that crisis he was sent to a facility in Vermont to remain hidden. Unsatisfied with his medical care the re, he requested that he be allowed to continue seeing me. He was then moved to the Mount Weather base near where I was living while working part - time at the CIA, Mount Weather, and the Pentagon. He had the use of a house there in the woods of the base, un der an assumed name without sporting his beard or Arab garb. Medically, he was doing much better at that point and I saw him only twice at that location, before other events interceded [in August of 2004]... 10 "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 59 Arrigo details the origin of the military u se of psychokinesis from one Japanese Zen monk’s spiritual talents in the abatement of atmospheric radiation that were eventually replicated in US experiments: It was not until 1938, in Nazi Germany, that the first experiments showed that the mind could c hange the radioactivity of a substance per se. That experiment was done to see if it was possible to change the glow of radium painted dials cause them to “black - out” during air raid drills. That experiment was considered a success by the standards of the day... [as] the radium was noticeably fainter afterwards... It was thus not until after the dropping of the A - bombs on Japan that the question became a pressing one, as to whether the mind could cause radiation abatement. A curious note in the history on thi s topic comes from a Zen source. Namely, after the war, the US Army noted that around the area of a particular Zen monastery in Japan near Nagasaki there were very few deaths from the A - bomb’s radiation. That was attributed to a particular monk that cared for the sick and washed them. However, when the US army studied the radiation levels they found them less in the monastery and concluded that the wind patterns had prevented as high an exposure there. That interpretation could have been true except for one notable anomaly: in the vicinity of the monastery behind its walls the radiation levels were higher than expected. Still this was explained away as due to the washing of the monastery by the monks with the deposit of the dirt outside of the monastery. I t would not be until a few years later that the US army would test the Zen monk in question on his ability to directly abate radiation. When they did test him, they found that he was able to reduce radiation by about 82%. The reduction was long lasting, an d later he was asked to go to Bikini to help treat some of the survivors of radiation experiments there. But because he effected the radiation levels around him in general, and often in unpredictable ways, the US army, which wanted to study the effects of the radiation levels on human health, ended up sending him back to Japan. That monk’s name was Tomo Ayuhowi, and many Zen people considered him a local saint. He was renowned in his area for his kindness and his healing abilities and so the Army really did not think that his ability to lower radiation levels would be reproducible. Thus, there was little attempt at that time to do further experiments along these lines with an eye to finding or developing others who could do the same. I know about this early history on the topic because the CIA asked me to research the area and write up my findings, which I did in the mid - 1980s. 11 "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 60 Just as remote viewing became a weaponization of the innate human spiritual capacity for clairvoyance accessed by General Billy Mit chell in 1924, Dr. Arrigo’s research revealed that military psychokinesis, and radiation abatement in particular, shares its roots in the compassionate meditations of a Zen monk. An astounding record of the clashing forces of destruction and compassion is housed in the Hiroshima Peace Museum. The Hiroshima Buddha (left) was severely maimed by the nuclear blast of August 6, 1945, preserving for us in bronze a record of the twisted forms of the victims of US nuclear war atrocities in Japan. Dr. Arrigo’s resea rch has been provided for publication at grave danger to herself in a profound effort to avert a recurrence of nuclear war. She has continued to bear her enslavement by the CIA as a means of helping defeat pre - emptive nuclear strike plans within the US adm inistration as their primary remote viewer and psychokinesis expert, able to disintegrate radioactive materials by focused compassionate intent: Psychokinesis is a very broad subject and those unfamiliar with the topic are likely to make a number of unjus tified assumptions about it that I would like to dispel before we get into the details of it. First off, people believe that the mind is separate from so - called outer reality. Quantum physics experiments have proven that to be a false assumption – the resul ts of experiments are dependent upon the mind - set, the pre - conceived notions of the experimenter... One cannot accomplish a goal that one does not have – except by rare accidents of fate. Second, people believe that outer reality is comprised of matter that has mass and size, and that moving a large heavy object is harder than moving a small light one. If one has such a view of the world, one will be hard pressed to move anything at all given that most people view thoughts and intentions as so unsubstantial as to not be able to move a feather. However, if one changes one’s mind and thinks of outer reality as no more substantial than the dream fabric of the night – a flimsy mind state that dissipates immediately and automatically when one awakes or changes one’ s state of consciousness – then having an intention may easily shift the whole scene including the very scenery, or mountains. It is not unusual in a dream for one scene to completely dissolve and become another. So why should moving mountains with you inte ntion be anything surprising to you? It is only the case because you have bought into the concept of an external reality of matter that is separate from your mind. In quantum physics not even a single atom can be shown to exist, but you believe in the soli dity of rocks as if it was a proven fact. It is not a fact. It is an illusion in the Dreamtime. Yet there are some rules of cause and effect that still apply in the Dreamtime, some invariants, if you will. Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, Jewish, and Moslem s aints, masters of the Dreamtime, all agree on what those rules are. They are observable facts, if one takes the time to investigate... It is just that the rules are not as simplistic as most religious tenet writers put to paper. So others, seeing what appear s to be loopholes or inconsistencies, believe that they are not inviolable. That is due to inattention to details and wishful thinking. "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 61 The workings of karma/sin - virtue are certainties. It is through paying strict attention to them that one can develop cer tainty of one’s results. In the arena of preventing nuclear war and annihilation of the species and planet, nothing less is worthwhile... From the point of view of non - duality, all faults are one’s own. There is literally no one else to blame other than o ne’s self for the state of the world --- all the actors are manifestations of one’s own mind and its defilements... Depending on how one intends in the dreamtime, the results of one’s intentions appear to manifest in just one’s private experience or also in th e experience of so - called others. For example, in the case of playing war games with tanks, some students of psychokinesis will have a tank disappear from their view, or from a few people’s view, but not from everyone’s view. A master of psychokinesis sh ould have control over how the result manifests and not leave it to chance. If the intention is to disable the destructive potential of a nuclear missile heading towards a target, then it should disappear from everyone’s point of view. However, if the inte ntion is to get people to minimize their time in Hell, then it is better for those who are headed there to suffer from nuclear war and burn off some of the sin through suffering before they die. At least, that is the case assuming that they do not further compound their misdeeds as a result. Parallel universes can be invoked so that only those who advance the goal of nuclear war actually suffer from it. This is very important to understand because those pushing the world towards annihilation have anger in t heir minds directed towards others that they want to cause to suffer or die. Yet those people, by the very fact of that anger and partiality of mind do not have certainty of action. They cannot ensure that it is others, and not themselves and those that th ey are attached to that will end up the victims. In actual fact, their anger will cause them to suffer in the nuclear war with certainty and not even be able to die a quick death from it. It is a promise that God has already made and they do not have the a bility to undo. What they do have the ability to do, if they so choose, is to repent of their anger and plans for nuclear war, and beg God’s forgiveness. Then if they destroy the weapons and the threat to everyone that is the result of their existence, t hey too can avoid the intense suffering of radiation sickness, and the much worse fires and suffering of Hell itself. If the US government did not believe in Hell, then why have they commanded their remote viewers not to investigate its existence, its cond itions, and how beings end up there. It is critical intelligence for making an informed decision. Would you invest in a bank before checking its credit rating and solvency? Why believe instead in the words of a government that cannot even run an occupation successfully in a third world country? They have no certainty of action and their approval ratings show that the public knows it. So how can you keep your blinders on without massive doses of intentional ignorance – called stupidity? Is it good to emulat e stupidity? Will stupidity save you from suffering? Or is it a failed option, one that never had a chance to help anyone, let alone a government that inherited nuclear weapons? Ultimately, it is the case that different people experience the same event di fferently anyway. But this effect is greatly exaggerated when a strong intender is trying to get the optimal result for everyone in terms of minimizing their future suffering. For example, when Christ preformed miracles, some people saw people being healed or were healed themselves. Others without faith only saw a faker making trouble and wanted him stopped even if it took killing him to do so. The results that people got from coming to see Christ depended on their own state of mind. That said, I will now t alk about some of the experiments that the US military did on psychokinesis and what they said about the results of them. One of the tests that I participated in was on whether psychokinesis could be used to disable incoming nuclear missiles. This was a test that I designed myself as I had complained that Star Wars was ludicrous as one could do better, without technical difficulties or cost, just by intending the result that one wanted. Because I had made these comments at a JCS meeting during Reagan’s se cond term, one of the Generals present asked for me to put on a demo that Reagan could easily attend – as opposed to one out at the Nevada Test Site like some of the earlier ones that I had been involved in. As a result, I was standing in the Oval Office with Reagan at the time that this particular teat was run and the Pentagon was monitoring the results and conveying the results to Reagan by phone. Three planes were sent up and asked to fire missiles at a target – in this case the missiles were non - nuclear that fragmented into hundreds of pieces mimicking a multiple warhead nuclear weapon. The pieces were luminescent – like phosphorus tracers and easy to see in the night sky as well as to photograph. The military made a number of runs, conducted at a distant base in Okalahoma, if I remember correctly. Then they asked me to “deflect the rounds”. At first they believed that the missiles were not firing from the planes because they saw no tracers. But when the planes landed, indeed the missiles were missing."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 62 A s the evening progressed, they asked me to let the tracers start to show and then disappear so they could see where the psychokinesis was occurring in the sky. Remember that this is happening half a continent away from my physical location per their thinki ng. The next run recorded on film showed dots of light followed by darkness. They were of such brief duration that only a few of them were caught on the film, so they asked me to let the tracers show for longer. Now I am calling them tracers because they w ere luminescent but in fact they were large missiles of phosphorus on the order of a ton each. They lit up the sky very brightly before I was asked to demonstrate their psychokinetic destruction. Because the military wanted to track their psychokinetic dec ay, which was really instantaneous, I had to change my intention to a slower decay. So I let the missiles fizzle out like a balloon that is released without being tied. That gave a thin strand of light rather like a large firefly for each fragment. Althoug h the pretests had lots of phosphorus hitting the ground in pieces, and setting fields on fire, my runs had no fires starting and later examination in the morning did not find any phosphorus on the ground below. The military had trouble believing that i t had the right area and insisted on repeating the test. The second test was done the next day during daylight at another base, in the desert. In this case the military spread out large blue plastic tarps and looked for burns and melted plastic to judge ho w well I had done in destroying the missiles with my mind. Again, when we started they did not believe that I had destroyed the missiles even though the planes came back without them, since they saw nothing. So I ended up having to let a trace of the phosp horus start its burn and drop to the ground before getting rid of the rest so that they would believe me and believe that the missiles were over the plastic tarp area which was about the length of a runway and about 20 feet wide. I am a bit of a prankster so I arranged the first drops of the phosphorus to be in even lines on only the first tarp. One general later accused me of rigging the test though in fact I was more than half a continent away and everything I did occurred by the use of my mind not my han ds as he accused me of. The real issue was whether one could evaporate a nuclear weapon without having radioactive dust hit the ground. So the next test was one of putting uranium in a conventional missile as a dirty bomb. This was done at the Nevada Tes t Site in case I failed and again I was not on site. I was standing in Casey’s office at CIA HQ at the time with Reagan on the phone. The size of the bomb was about 500 lbs and the amount of radiation would have been substantial. The fallout downwind could have been a real problem and some Generals had objected to the test on that basis as it was after the Limited Test Ban Treaty. While there was no nuclear explosion per se and so there was no violation of the letter of the treaty, the amount of potential r elease of radiation was nearly half of the first A - bomb released over Japan. Given that being the case, the test was delayed until an almost windless day. I was not quite clear about the logic of that since I doubted that the radiation would be swept up by brooms before the next windy day. However, I had no intention of failing and so I went forward with the test. I am used to having certainty of result in that personality. It is because of that certainty of result that I have often been used for these test s. The result of the test was that there was no increase in radiation detected afterwards compared to what had been at the site previously. Some scientists objected that the radiation levels were slightly lower than they had been before and said that the r esults might not have been from getting rid of the radiation in the bomb as much as getting rid of it on the ground afterwards. I found that a moot point. After all the point was to prevent fallout that could hurt people. "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 63 That test was followed a few m onths later by more sophisticated tests on decreasing specific types of radiation – such as gamma rays versus alpha waves. It really made no difference – it was only a difference in the intention. Those tests were run underground in caverns already created b y nuclear explosions. The tests showed that the mind could evaporate a ton of highly radioactive material instantaneously. In this case we had visuals directly from security camera in the cavern. In one frame the ton of uranium is there and in the next it was almost not and the second one it was gone. People accused me of getting kickbacks from the uranium ore company that I wasted a ton of the precious material but that was not the case. Here I have omitted details of the actual tests because of true natio nal security reasons. Omission of the details in this specific case will not prevent countries from protecting themselves from nuclear war and fallout. The next set of tests that I want to mention happened a few years later in the Bush Sr. administration. These tests involved me at the site of the radiation, in this case at the Nevada Test Site primarily. I was asked to walk through radioactive caverns and ingest large lethal doses of radiation to test my abilities. Really it was a little bizarre since I c ould decontaminate a whole cavern of the radiation after an atomic explosion, so there was no need to force me to ingest lethal doses before I decontaminated it. The experiments verged on the sadistic and except that I had very unusual abilities relative t o my body I would not have survived them. 12 The Gnome nuclear blast cavity (above), located 1,184’ below Carlsbad, New Mexico is another test - site that was likely used for these very sensitive radiation abatement and clean - up experiments. Arrigo documents an astonishing feat of human consciousness that, if replicated on a larger scale, could reverse the contamination of our planet and the destiny of our species. However, she also warns that the feasibility of radiation abatement by psychokinetic masters has fed into the Nazi US government genocidal fantasies by providing a potential means to clean up their premeditated radiation disaster."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 64 When I arrived up at the Mount Weather base in October of 2003, I quickly discovered that I had been recalled from Canada because the US had run out of more conventional solutions to a problem that they felt was urgent to solve. The problem was explained to me by the Commander of Mount Weather as “We plan to use this base for its intended function (to house the US officials in the event of nuclear war) but all of the remote viewers say that no one will survive a nuclear war here... You are the one that says everything is possible... You are the one that we trust to be able to do it.” “Perhaps you misunderstand what I say at t he beginning of my remote viewing training intensives – I say that anything that is ethical to do can be done.” “What is unethical about saving the life of the President and his advisors?” he asked. “Billions of other people dead from the nuclear war.” I replied. “But the scientists have calculated out the number of people that need to survive to have enough genetic variation for the species to continue and they put the number at 210 families. We will have 240 for extra margin of safety.” I looked down a t my shoes in embarrassment. Not only were the scientists wrong per my intuition, but also I had just been told that the US government intended to nuke everyone off the face of the planet and leave only 240 families in a hole in the ground... I called Tenet at CIA Headquarters and asked to speak to him... He said “There have been changes around here since I last saw you. They (the White House) believe nuclear war is inevitable, only a matter of time. They want” and his voice quavered momentarily “to schedule t he end as part of a ceremony, on a solstice, for the best effect... This is for real. This is the way they see it. Take everyone else out and start over — just them. That way there is no overpopulation; no racial tension; no exhaustion of the petroleum reserve s. They can’t imagine life without oil. They don’t want to share what is left of it...” “But that is insane” I replied. “We can go to another source of fuel. We can create new solutions.” “That is not the way they see it. They don’t have the confidence t hat you have. They don’t believe that creativity will always find a solution... They want you to bring [the radiation] back down to normal background levels after everyone else is dead, down to normal again like you did at the Nevada Test Site demonstration. ” “I can’t do that to preserve the lives of mass murderers.” I replied... “I refuse to help them kill off the planet’s life, even if I could do what they wanted, which I can’t”..."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 65 Over the next few days [Senator Jay] Rockefeller [at left] showed up a numbe r of times with contractors to explain to them what he wanted changed in his “privatized part” of the underground facility. While most of the facility was not much different in style than the inside of CIA headquarters, there were some notable exceptions. Rockefeller’s section already looked like the inside of the New York Metropolitan Museum filled with precious art objects and with high vaulted gothic ceilings. He now ordered that his section be expanded from mansion - size to three times as large, and a ne w swimming pool installed which was about Olympic - sized. I was not happy with this change as an enormous amount of dust was generated by this construction over the many months it took to complete and that overloaded the air filtering system which had to be replaced and upgraded again to handle the extra interior volume. The facility was now about 9% larger overall. And the construction thinned the wall of rock that was acting to make the shelter safe. Even in the construction of this ‘albatross’ the concern ed parties were unable to agree on what was fair in terms of size or number of people to be admitted to it. Rockefeller intended to bring in whomever he wanted at the last moment, including all the “cousins” that he liked and their children. Officially, th ere were only two Rockefellers on the list [ – Jay and his uncle David]... I wrote up my remote viewing findings on the Mount Weather [radiation shelter scenario] over the month of October 2003. Those retreating to the base in the event of a nuclear war woul d almost certainly kill each other off long before the radiation levels became livable. There would be too many alpha - males in a small space. Minor disagreements would be magnified in a confined space under stress. Major disagreements that already divided them would be even harder to check than before. By having killed billions of innocent human beings, the taboo against killing would be so weakened as to be non - existent. They would kill each other, just as they had killed others. The next day, on about N ovember 4, 2003, I was called into the White House to explain my report in person to Bush Jr. and Bush Sr. as they were upset by the content of it. Also present in the Oval Office at the time were Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, but no one else... Only thre e copies of that report had been made “for eyes only”; one for the President, one for Tenet, and one for the Commander of Mount Weather whose duty it was to report to the JCS on all matters concerning that base... Rumsfeld wanted me to go point by point thr ough my report on why a nuclear first strike would not be survivable. The report that I had written was about fourteen pages long, plus an appendix, which was over two hundred pages and went through the actual remote viewing analyses... What one sees as a vi ewer are possible futures. My specialty in remote viewing has been to develop the analyses so that those possible futures have reliable probabilities assigned to them. Since I have a mathematical training and have done much stock prediction in one personal ity, I have been able to scientifically validate the analyses that I developed... It has to do with holographic mind — a way of seeing all the possibilities at once in a flash of understanding. Most people have never experienced such an understanding and can not believe that such a state of mind is possible... So to convince them I gave them the experience of holographic mind for a while. It is such a different way of understanding the world that most people cannot hold that understanding after they come out of it. All they can do is know that they had the experience of the understanding briefly. It is like looking at a city map before folding it up again. You know that you saw it but you couldn’t say much about what it was that you saw and you couldn’t reproduce the map from memory. But having been shown it by someone telling you directions, you can believe that they do know how to direct you to get to your destination. So after I explained holographic analysis and demonstrated it, they no longer questioned my as sertions about the probability of the events that I discussed in my report. None - the - less, Rumsfeld wanted me to go through each point carefully to make sure that I had not overlooked anything. So I did. "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 66 When I got to the point of asserting that the surviv ors would have to stay in the shelter for over 5 years in order to not die in their first month out of it, Rumsfeld wanted to know why I was able to conclude that? Would no remote viewer be able to bring down the radiation any better than that? I tried to demonstrate that by putting them back into holographic mind but their nausea in witnessing their possible future radiation sickness was too great for them to stand and they refused to continue with the demonstration. I said that if they could not even stan d to remote view how nauseated they might be in the future that they shouldn’t undertake the course of action that led to that... As we continued stepping through the report, it dawned on Rumsfeld that I might be right that nuclear first - strike would not b e survivable. As Rumsfeld started to agree with me and with Tenet that it was a bad idea, Cheney began attacking me personally. The attacks were not based on the evidence, but on his perception of me being “disloyal” for not agreeing with him... Finally, Rum sfeld asked to at least be allowed to hear me out. Cheney refused and said that I was poisoning their minds against the plan. He stated that the only reason that Tenet was no longer in favor of the plan was because of his contact with me. He then started s wearing at me and calling me obscenities. I told them to get a remote viewer that they could trust and walked out of the Oval Office. Before I made it out of the building I was handcuffed and escorted back to the Oval Office where I was berated for my “u ncooperative attitude”. I said that I would not speak as long as the handcuffs were on me. I was sent to the basement holding cell where for two days I did not say a word. On the third day, the handcuffs were removed and I was escorted back up to a room on the first floor. There I was given a fresh set of clothes and told to shower. I did so and was escorted again into the Oval Office. Bush Sr. asked me how long it would take for me to train another remote viewer to take my place. I pointed out that over t he decades I had trained hundreds of good viewers, especially for the Office of Naval Intelligence and that they could easily replace me with one of those men. Bush Jr. asked me if any of them could affect radiation levels as well as I could, and I replie d, “If you want to know, test them.” That is how it got left. I was to continue finding ways to make Mt. Weather survivable until I was replaced by one of my students... Then about six months after they started looking for a replacement for me, I was called to the White House and told to finish training a particular ONI student of mine up to my level of competency in radiation abatement... The ONI officer had slowed the rate of radioactive emissions... to one twenty - eighth of what was expected. In front of Bush Jr., I asked the naval officer to repeat the experiment while knowing that the US elite planned to use his skill to bale them out after killing off the rest of the humans on the planet. The naval officer fainted dead away. After he recovered from the shock , the test was repeated back at ONI HQ’s. The atomic clock advanced 26 hours in 24 hours under these conditions, which means that the radioactive emission of the Cesium was higher and thus more toxic. The ONI then tested another 3 of their best psycho - ki nesis officers with this unethical scenario with clock results that varied from 18 hours to 32 hours in day’s test. They even insisted on re - testing me at this task with the result that the clock ran 24 - hours in a 24 - hour period and I was accused of not tr ying... The US administration refused to believe that I could not do what they wanted. They have no understanding of spiritual law and how [radiation abatement] effects are achieved... 13 Arrigo’s ability to determine the ethical balance enables her accuracy in considering all of the possible outcomes, not only the desired set of outcomes. In her explications, Arrigo confirms that the universal laws of physics cannot be altered carelessly, but only through focused, compassionate intent: Since I was involved in much of that research as a gifted psychokinetic expert and trainer, I feel that it is my responsibility to make sure that radiation abatement is used to help the planet, not as a rescue strategy after a first strike. It is completely immoral and unconscion able to launch nuclear weapons to kill everyone above ground and then reverse the radiation and come out of one’s shelter to have all of the oil just for oneself and one’s progeny. I can not remain silent given what I know about the US plans, even though t hey tortured me again last week in Nyon, Switzerland in a makeshift torture chamber in a basement to try to silence me. 14 Dr. Arrigo’s insider accounts show the global nuclear threat to have grown from the ignorance and greed of petty old men who fear thei r own eminent demise and perhaps the impending suffering of their next incarnation, brought upon themselves by orchestrating mass murder for the better part of their adult lives. These are the products of generational cycles of ritualized child torture and entrapment that now govern the US. Indeed, it is a simple problem of psychopathic liars believing their own lies."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 67 A true understanding of the unique physics of water, an abundant fuel, alleviates all of the limitations of oil - based technologies and over - p opulation. Water, and HHO plasma generated from water, can provide for all human needs, as originally discovered and developed by Nikola Tesla, only to be hidden by the Nazis and developed as stealth plasma - cloaking technology. The thorough compartmentaliz ation of the US government’s secret scientific projects has blocked many advances in awareness of the potential of HHO plasmas for free energy production and human well being. However, a few independent inventors have reconfirmed Tesla’s results and engine ered free - energy reactors using HHO resonant - transfer plasmas, now being marketed for heating homes by Blacklight Power, Inc. 15 Another independent inventor, Denny Klein of Clearwater, Florida, has engineered and marketed an HHO plasma torch 16 using the same basic process. Both of these technologies are extremely safe and clean, as HHO plasma is created in a vacuum tube that, if broken, quenches the plasma reaction and releases only water vapor! In addition, HHO plasmas release healthy UVA light, and no UVB o r C. The advanced technological achievements of humanity now allow the necessary shift to sustainability that can salvage our polluted planet. The transition from oil - based to water - based fuel brings an opportunity for those abusive controllers of the ant iquated systems to redeem themselves by sharing this technology widely. Who among the controlling elite will resign from their mass murdering and redeem themselves by doing so? Dr. Arrigo’s unique efforts suggest there are many willing to act: At the time of that conference [on WMD at George Tenet’s mansion in the first week of May, 2004]... I had before me in my mind already the upcoming torture in August. And I saw that I could avoid that if I “played it safe” and went along with the flow toward nuclear wa r and the local wars in the Middle East. As much as I personally wanted to sell out, I was unable to because I knew the consequences to my soul if I did so. Many people have become saints through praying to know the consequences of their actions. Saint The resa of Avila in the 1500’s or so had a vision of the small cramped space in Hell that God showed her that her vanity over her looks had earned her. As a result she became serious about the welfare of her soul. She made spiritual progress and developed the rapture of uniting her will with Christ and had to be held down during mass to prevent her levitation. She is the founder of the Carmelite convents. I recommend that people pray to know the consequences of their behavior – it is very sobering to know. It i s more important than knowing the price of items or how to make a living, because it has much more far reaching effects for one’s self and for those around one. So at the conference I prayed that those men know the consequences of their actions in giving tacit approval to the US administration’s plan to kill off the planet with radiation and then reverse the radioactivity by psychokinetic means. I made that prayer silently while I was listening to another presenter, Tenet, as a spur of the moment thought. Suddenly, all the men in the room fainted dead away and their minds were confronted with visions of their afterlives. You can ask some of them directly, what it was that they experienced at that time. It was not until Tenet was done being scheduled to tel l them lies that morning that they returned to their usual bodily perceptions. Having spent only a few hours knowing the consequences they easily went back into denial again. Yet many said that they were completely shocked to learn that the suffering they saw of the denizens of Hell was so dreadful. Three of the men resigned from being heads of their intelligence agencies within about a month later. One of these three was the head of the SVR, the Russian intelligence service that used to be the KGB. Altho ugh officially Russia was not considered a “friendly foreign intelligence” service, the CIA had gone to a lot of trouble after the Cold War to advance this man’s particular career and “well - being”. As a result he was invited to this conference as a full pa rticipant. I knew him quite well as I had negotiated intelligence sharing agreements between the CIA and the SRV over many years. After this session, this Russian SRV General sitting next to me said “Strong vodka you serve here – it opens the eyes, not shut s them to the ethical concerns. Next time tell me "},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 68 in advance when you are going to serve it so that I can drink Smirnoffs instead.” I then admitted to him that it occurred as a result of a passing thought of mine, without pre - meditation. He said, more as a question than a statement, “It is a good thing that you do not pre - meditate me harm then.” Tenet was less than pleased and coming to in a now wrinkled suit, he exclaimed loudly, “Would someone please get this woman off my back before I am a ruined shirt?” He, of course, was one of the three to resign, a decision he did not make until later that same day. That night he asked me in private “How do I avoid that (Hell)?” We spent much of the night discussing what he would need to do to clean up his soul. The next day he phoned the White House and said that he wanted to change the focus of the negotiations to the terms of his resignation. The conference still had three days to go and those negotiations were quite involved and lengthy [and resulted in George Te net’s resignation from his relatively long - held DCI post on July 11, 2004, at a time when it was most convenient to deflect blame for the falsified WMD intelligence reports, cooked - up as the impetus for the 2003 Iraq invasion. Tenet, however, acknowledged that he had stepped down due to “personal reasons”]. How can men who have seen their likely condition after death later ignore it? It is the most important intelligence one could have and yet most of them threw it away. Good intelligence is often discard ed by intelligence services when it runs counter to the “prevailing winds of deception” within an agency. Those who were most affected by it were those who knew me best and had the most confidence in my integrity and thus in what they had witnessed. The th ird resignation was [rendered on May 6, 2004 by Sir Richard Dearlove (at left),] the Head of MI6. I had worked closely with MI5 for about twenty years and with MI6 for the last five years of my time working at the CIA (1998 - 2001, 2003 - 2004). The Head of MI 6 was a particularly close friend of mine, of a non - sexual nature. I had “assisted at the birth” of one of his children who had nearly been born blue in about 2000. So I had thereafter stayed at his house whenever I passed through London, which was several times a year. We had many long talks about the state of the world and our respective agencies. And while we did not see eye to eye on most topics, we managed a mutual respect that bordered on the miraculous. I mention all this because it is relevant to our discussion in a number of ways. First, intelligence heads are ordinary people with their own private sufferings. Second, it is relevant to his wife’s suicide the month after he resigned. At the conference the next day, he told me of his decision to res ign. He did not know of Tenet or the SRV head’s decisions as they were all made independently. He mentioned his wife and getting to spend more time with his family as part of the reason for the decision. I told him that he should not share his vision of He ll with his wife if he wanted her to live. We were interrupted by Tenet to resume the next session and never talked much more about it... [Richard Dearlove] ignored my warning and told his wife in depth about where he would end up in Hell, if he didn’t cor rect his life. His wife suddenly understood what his life had consisted of and she was unable to live with the guilt of having been the wife of a man who had ordered people tortured. The pictures of Abu Gharib were freshly released and that combined with h er husband’s confession to her were too much for her to live with. So while it is very good for people to face this intelligence on their after - life and correct the problems, it requires case - by - case analysis to decide whether it is appropriate to share th at information with others. Such decisions are often best made with the help of a competent remote viewer whose advice one is willing to take. One could ask those retired intelligence heads to verify what I say about the US plans to go to nuclear war with psychokinetic rescue after it. They might try to avoid a direct answer, but they might decide that their soul’s health now required them to tell the Truth. Certainly, they had adequate knowledge of the classified documents to know the truth of the matter independent of what I said at that conference. And they have adequate standing in the field of intelligence to make what they say on the matter newsworthy. It is possible that to save the world and their souls in the process that they will now break ranks from the Reverse Christians and speak the Truth. I believe that they will, if given a suitable gentle opportunity to do so. However, a denial would not carry much weight as it is just likely more of the hot air of the “prevailing wind”. 17 "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 69 While the special efforts of Sue Arrigo have significantly affected those who regret their crimes against humanity, there are many who have ignored her profound insight and continue to compound their grave karmic mistakes. Such maniacal psychopaths vehemently refuse spirit ual help, to their own destruction. There is ample evidence from Vice President Dick Cheney’s own declarations and legal position that he is quite personally involved in the serial torture of anyone who will not comply with the Nazi New World Order war pla ns. His deranged criminal mentality is exposed in Dr. Arrigo’s accounts (the most abhorrent recent episodes of which have not been included here): As a coerced CIA asset, I was asked by Cheney in August of 2004 to frame Iran as developing nuclear weap ons. Because Cheney was afraid of CIA leaks, he gave me the assignment at a Chinese restaurant in DC after hours. It was not the first meeting that I have ever had privately with him as I acted as a negotiator between him and Tenet. Within the CIA I had be en an outspoken critic of US wars of aggression, its nuclear first strike plans and breaking of nuclear arms control treaties. I spent most of my life as an operative risking my life as a remote viewing spy monitoring and recovering lost WMD. I am a docto r and the assignment Cheney gave me was to go to Iran as a physician. Once in Iran, a camera crew would be filming when an Iranian agent would rush in to say that he knew a secret bunker where the Iranian government was developing nuclear weapons. Cheney a dmitted that the rest of the filming would occur in Hollywood with a mock up of said lab. Clearly, this was an immoral assignment. There was no way that I was going to have the blood of innocent Iranian women and children on my hands, so I refused. When I did so, Cheney threatened the life of my mother. Since my mother had recently told me she would rather die than have me be emotionally blackmailed in this way, I held to my no. During the course of our about forty - minute talk, one of his secret service officers interrupted us twice. The next week when I was kidnapped in Virginia, raped and tortured for four days, I recognized the voice of that officer as one of the rapists. It is an outrage that Cheney is advocating torture. He has already shown by his a ctions, that he will stop at nothing, not even the torture of American born CIA personnel in order to get his way. He has a clear conflict of interest in making money off these wars. Are we, as Americans, going to torture people just so that corrupt offi cials can line their pockets with oil and war profiteering revenues? ... I was raped and subjected to three mock executions, when will this US reign of terror end? 18 "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 70 At the helm of the US government are a group of maniacal Nazi psychopaths getting ready to p ush the nuclear radiation button. Why is George W. lying incessantly and threatening to kill off the entire human species? He knows that his father is a serial killer who buys the law, and will have him killed if he doesn’t do as he is told. George has bee n traumatized by having been forced from childhood into killing, like his father and his grandfather before him. The trauma - based methodology of controlling CIA assets is somewhat different in the case of ‘Manchurian’ Presidents. Sue Arrigo has retold the extensive history of her close interactions as a mind - controlled slave of the Scherf family, having witnessed and been forced, under threat of death, to cover - up their satanic serial murders – never having known the true identity of her Nazi German torturer George H. Scherf, Jr., alias George Herbert Walker Bush: In 1990, I wrote a report for DCI Webster about the national security threat caused by having Bio - warfare Labs and recommended that they all be closed. The records from the Fort Detrick Lab show ed that a vaccine against the HIV virus had been developed. It had been given to many members of the Cabal at a White House Ceremony on a Summer Solstice, in about 1983. The next day a big lot of HIV infected units of blood were shipped to kill blacks in a war - zone in Africa. The existence of the vaccine was kept secret. That secrecy was continued even after I recommended in my report that immediate worldwide vaccination begin. It was a crime against humanity to infect people with the bio - warfare agent HIV... Under Bush, Sr. I was forced to act in my medical capacity in a non - standard way when the White House pathologist died of less than natural causes and had to be replaced. My duties included faking autopsies that carried his signature as if he were still alive. These autopsy reports were used to falsify the causes of death, the location of death, and cover - up the crimes committed in the White House’s torture chamber in the basement. Failure to adequately falsify an autopsy report had lead to the death of t hat pathologist. So it was clear what I could expect my fate to be if I did not do a better cover - up job than he had done. He was a pathologist at Walter Reed Hospital and all of the autopsy reports that I wrote up attributing the deaths to auto accidents , etc. were on that Army hospital’s letterhead. The bodies themselves were incinerated in the White House basement, adjacent to the morgue. That the White House has a well - equipped torture chamber in its basement is not theoretical to me, I have been tortu red in it myself. It is directly across the hallway from the morgue, a visible reminder to me as to the necessity for forging the autopsy records skillfully. Although I am willing to take stands that result in my being tortured by the US government I do so selectively according to an internal cost - benefit analysis that others might not understand. During Bush, Sr.’s reign as President I performed 37 autopsies in the White House morgue. Many of those were children. Most of them had been tortured and then ri tually killed with a knife to cut their heart out. Additional wounds were often symmetrical knife wounds in the chest and belly. Such symmetrical wounds are rarely seen in crimes of passion, or even pre - meditated assaults. They are almost always due to de liberate rituals of a satanic nature. To have seen so many of these wounds in a series of patients indicates that reverse Christianity was practiced at that location... [a military base not far from the White House.] I did at one point discuss the autopsies with then President Bush, Sr. in the Oval Office. I politely but firmly said that many of the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 71 corpses that I was receiving in the White House morgue should never have ended up dead in the first place and that unless there were better controls on how people got there I predicted that there would be grave trouble. Bush, Sr. did not act surprised to hear of the traffic of corpses in the morgue; he was the one that had assigned me to do the autopsies in the first place. Nor did he question my report on the numb er of bodies I was seeing or on the mutilations that were in evidence upon them, which I outlined. He said that he would look into the matter and dismissed me from the room. The number of corpses did go down to about a fourth of what it had been previously , though otherwise there was no change. The mutilations that occurred before death as judged by standard forensic considerations continued. Since I was later forced to take Bush, Sr. and Bush, Jr. on a tour of part of Yugoslavia during the war, while Cli nton was in office, I have more than enough eyewitness testimony on reverse Christianity being practiced by the Bush family, including the killing of others on the battlefield and the eating of their raw hearts as a ritual sacrifice. Such matters are highl y unpleasant to mention and I hope that the reader will forgive me... 19 The suppressed eyewitness testimony of Dr. Arrigo is quite horrific, leaving nothing to the imagination by necessity. Arrigo’s courageous web publication of the circumstances of her corporate enslavement by the CIA may well have preserved her life. The unpleasantness of the truth has hidden psychopathic cycles of behavior for long enough, and the time has certainly now come for complete disclosure of the whole, ugly truth. The very s urvival of the human species depends on the critical discernment of a global society traumatized by the false - leadership of tortured and hateful individuals like Adolf Hitler, George Scherf, Sr., his son George Scherf, Jr. and his grandson George W. After many decades of forced personal interactions with these psychopaths Dr. Arrigo has identified child slavery and generational sexual abuse in the Scherf (Bush) family, having also been verified by remote viewing assessment: Bush, Sr. [with his father (abov e, left) and son (at right)] had a certain look of boy he liked, like the youngest boy from “Leave it To Beaver”, Jerry Mathers. They looked like he looked when he was a boy before “it happened to him” at age six. He kept on sodomizing kids like his dad so domized him. His father kept it up much longer than others can imagine. He kept it up until he was close to death. Some things run in families. Would you want to see your dad if that continued to be what you had to submit to? Dark and ugly secrets that e ven the principals might not know — what with multiplicity being what it is. Bush, Sr. — does he even know that he goes to that [military] base [to commit serial murders] and why? I leave it to your remote viewing skills and imagination to decide. I was not a t the CIA because of my ability to imagine what loose ends there were. I was there to know what loose ends there were and failing to know could cost me my life and more than that. 20 "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 72 It is a difficult task for a truly conscionable human being to comprehend the root of sociopathic behavior. The extreme prevalence of serial killers among Caucasian populations suggests that the Nazi eugenic goal of a ‘pure Aryan race’ may have been an effort, perhaps unconscious, to create a gene pool more apt to produce psycho pathic individuals who operate socially without conscience. The term ‘bloodliner’ has been applied to psychopathic victims of generational sexual abuse, as in the case of the Scherfs – a designation that may be supported scientifically by a genetic predispo sition to psychopathy among males with the YY chromosome (rare exceptions to the predominant XY). Otto Skorzeny exposed a multi - generational human reproduction experiment for the Fourth Reich repopulation of North America with secret subterranean Aryan pop ulations exceeding 20 million . Skorzeny reported himself to be one of the elite ‘inseminators’ for the vast human reproduction experiment, now in its sixth decade, being conducted at the secret Nazi base in Glacier National Park, Montana and elsewhere belo w the bedrock of America: Hitler’s entire nazi Third Reich of 50,000+ have been living in secret underground bases throughout the United States, Canada, England, France and Italy ever since the “supposed” end of World War II. Hitler and his entire Thir d Reich of nazis have been actively planning for their New World Order or Fourth Reich in America at these secret underground bases. The initial 50,000 nazis have been reproducing like rabbits for the last 58 years. It is estimated that there are now more than 20 million nazis living in America above ground and below ground in secret New World Order bases. The 20 million does not include the millions more who are secret nazi sympathizers. American Citizens are forbidden to enter these US government - sponsore d New World Order nazi bases under penalty of death. Secret bases [include]... Area - 51, NV; Camp Hero Montauk, NY; Las Cruces, NM; Wright Patterson “underground” Air Force Base, OH; and the secret hollowed - out mountain base in Glacier National Park, MT. [The secret entrance to the Glacier Park, Montana base is circled above.] Inside of these “forbidden” bases lie complete replicas of Berlin, Germany... [built within] underground rooms the size of ten football fields that house the stolen Jewish Holocaust “cache ” of trillions of dollars, gold and gold artifacts. New World Order SS nazis are allowed complete access to these secret underground bases. These nazis are encouraged to visit each secret underground base as often as possible. However, no cameras are allow ed and they must sign an oath of secrecy. If they break their oath, they are killed!"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 73 Each New World Order nazi is allowed access to the “gold rooms.” He or she is allowed to “wallow” or “swim” in piles of gold coins that reach as high as the ceiling. The y are allowed to wear any of the stolen Jewish gold jewelry including crowns, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, diamonds, et al. The only “catch” is that they must only wear their underwear while in the gold rooms and they are not allowed to remove any of the s tolen gold or treasure from these rooms nor the underground bases. They are x - rayed as they leave the “gold rooms” and given a fresh change of clothes to put on. Along the streets of the fake underground “New” Berlin, there are shops just like the real Ber lin. However, everything is free there. In this illegal underground New World Order, New Berlin, Tesla’s free - energy devices are used everyday including Tesla’s antigravity, optically invisible, flying disk. There are at least 500 secret underground New Wo rld Order bases around the USA and thousands more in Canada, England, France and Italy. There are also underground ski mountains, with snow and gondola lifts that resemble the Alps, at these secret New World Order bases. It’s like an underground nazi Disne y World down there. In these underground New World Order bases there are “Aryan Breeding Rooms” or free brothels. There are thousands of beautiful “brain washed” women and kidnapped underage teenage girls from around the country there to “service” the men . The New World Order nazis want the “seed” or “sperm” from their old Third Reich SS nazi leaders to implant in their young brainwashed – “brainless”, “Aryan” baby - breeders to help populate “their” new world with “pure” white Aryan babies. These babies will grow up to “rule” the United States of Germany, “formerly the United States of America.” Skorzeny claims to have made more than 20,000 “personal” donations. According to Skorzeny, unlimited amounts of free drugs and free German beer are available at these secret New World Order underground bases. 21 The vast implications of the confessions of Nazi principal Otto Skorzeny are quietly spreading among the American people through the work of Erik ‘Orion’ Berman, whose detailed information completely corroborate s the testimony of Dr. Sue Arrigo and the hundreds of the other published testimonies of the survivors of child torture in covert US government and CIA operations. Berman explains the origins of the well - known nicknames of George Bush, Sr. as inside jokes even more revealing of his habits than his first now - famous nickname (‘Curious George’): “Skorzeny claims that George H.W. Bush was/is a heroin junky. He was constantly “smacked - out” to escape his guilty conscience! That’s how he earned his nickname “Poppy !” 22 George’s true German identity, George H. Scherf, Jr., is insinuated by another insider nickname that has been leaked – “old ‘kraut” (a derogatory term for German “ Sauerkraut - eating ” people). While both Skorzeny and Berman have expressed hatred for Geor ge Scherf, Arrigo responds with pure spiritual compassion for her torturers and handlers due to her clairvoyant pre - viewing of their pain and suffering in future incarnations (selected by the higher self for atonement). How can this chain of generational psychopathic control be broken for the survival of humanity during times of drastic environmental change? The technological solution is ready and waiting to make use of truly abundant fuels like water and focused infrasound , to be holistically employed at pyramid sites by current and future generations. As well, Sue Arrigo provides us with a spiritual solution to dealing with torturers – creativity and compassion: “ Torturers are often very tormented people who cannot stand change because they are emotionally fragile. That emotional fragility is the result of causing others to be emotionally fragile.” 23 Arrigo’s perception of how fragile her controllers are themselves, allows her immediate forgiveness and compassionate response to the extreme pain they inflict upon her: One knows that one is in God's hands and surrenders to that. In some sense it brings greater peace than one's daily life because one has no choices to make -- everything is out of one's hands and in the hands of God. Really, that is always true. But I am much more aware of it when I am being tortured. Being tortured does not mean that God has abandoned one. Pain does not mean that. Suffering does not mean that. So, how can one find God's Love and Care in the midst of great pain and suffering? O ne finds it by inviting it into your heart to give to those who harm you. As long as you do not want them to be free of suffering and have it alleviated completely by God, you cannot get God to completely alleviate your own suffering. But at the moment tha t one says to God, \"Even though I am suffering terribly, please have mercy on these men and relieve their suffering first\" then God hears your prayer. You have to be sincere in it. You have to put the welfare of your tormentors before your own welfare... thi s is the one True Path that I have found to deal with suffering and torture. All the saints can tell you that Christ spoke truly and wisely and pointed out a True Path to God's Mercy by saying \"Love Thy Enemy as yourself\"... 24 "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 74 Sue expresses the essence of co mpassionate thought and action by projecting, instead of fear, a deep love for the emotionally handicapped who serially hurt themselves and others. Arrigo identifies an insidious sociopathic cycle that must become widely recognized and understood from a sc ientific perspective. Analysis of neural activity in psychopaths has revealed significant differences from healthy human function, by which psychopaths may be quickly identified. Empathy tests have conclusively demonstrated that emotive response to facial expression is much lower in psychopaths, and that in particular, fear is processed quite differently than in healthy individuals. “ Both groups had increased activity in brain areas involved in processing facial expressions in response to happy faces compar ed with neutral faces, but this increase was smaller among the psychopaths. By contrast, when processing fearful faces compared with neutral faces, the healthy volunteers showed increased activation and the psychopaths decreased activation in these brain r egions.” 25 Ps ychopaths are unable to process the fear and distress of others. Arrigo’s torturous lifetime entanglement within the psychopathic command structure has afforded her several precious opportunities to investigate the system from the inside. Her willful and penetrating investigations from within the Rockefeller Archives and CIA databases reveal a genetic control mechanism that has ensured the spread of psychopathic genes within the global Nazi crime syndicate – or as Arrigo refers to it: ‘ The Family Business of the Rothschilds, Rockefeller, Hitler, Bush, and Clinton’: This slide is from the same CIA computer showing the distribution of the profits from the Contra drug running. You see there that 47% of the profits from it are going to David Ro ckefeller and 12% to other Rockefeller family members. Then notice that 11% is going to the Rothschilds, 7% is going to the Bush family, 4% to the Clinton family, and the rest mostly to other families in Skull & Bones and related Satanic groups... It is quit e curious to find the Clinton family on the list so soon, as Bill Clinton was not President yet. However, reading the book ‘Barry & the Boys: The CIA, the Mob and America's Secret History’ about CIA operative Barry Seal helping drop the bags of cocaine int o Meno, Arkansas where Clinton was Governor and part of Rockefeller's drug running cover - up will help explain that. Also, if you look at the DNA of some prominent members of [the Bush and Clinton] families you find that they are illegitimate children of a Rockefeller. The DNA pictures came across my desk at the CIA because David Rockefeller was trying to figure out how to always have a Rockefeller in the White House without the public"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 75 knowing about it... The Rockefeller family has a long tradition of sleep ing with other people's wives as part of an initiation ceremony into making the husbands part of their business family. The deal is that the Rockefellers will only shower financial blessings on the man after his wife has given birth to a male child. DNA te sting has made that easier for the Rockefellers to monitor that aspect of the devil's agreement... Here is a slide showing the Rockefeller genes, distinguishable by this rare distinctive banding pattern on chromosome number 12 and also on these other 2 chr omosomes. Here are those same exact patterns from blood taken from Bush, Sr. and Jr., Bill Clinton, and John Kerry who were all members of the death worship and sexual perversion cult called Skull & Bones. The illegal activities of the CIA are a \"family b usiness\"; the Rockefellers are related to the Rothschilds by a similar mechanism. The Rockefellers are the American branch of the Rothschilds and only became rich and prominent when the Rothschilds began funding them during the American Civil War. See ‘Th e Conspiracy Explained’ about the Rothschild maneuvers to start that Civil War in order to prevent American competition to his power. He funded the Rockefellers as his down - line to help control America. Here is a slide of the DNA showing that the Rockefe llers are related to the Rothschilds and here is the slide showing that Hitler’s father was the illegitimate son of Baron Rothschild and Maria Anna Schickigruber... The DNA sample for Hitler comes from a semen stain on a piece of clothing kept by a Jewish wo man in WWII, rather like the Monica Lewinsky dress. The German Secret Service killed the woman for trying to seek justice, but her underwear were preserved in a later Stasi file as a piece of historical memorabilia from the war. Officially, there was an ed ict in Nazi Germany against having sex with Jewish women; it was an edict which was variably enforced. Had she been raped directly by a Rothschild and not Hitler, she could have gotten hush money, not death, for her troubles. 26 Arrigo’s detailed recollect ion of her previous insider investigations into the CIA - controlled genetic evidence provides us with essential information that will eventually be corroborated by independent findings. These precise details regarding the distinctive chromosome 12 banding p attern of the global crime family members will be an invaluable resource for the future prosecution of their serial genocides, committed consistently for the more than two centuries since their global banking monopoly was established. While Arrigo’s conten tion may not be proven for some years, there is much corroboration for her claims in not only the activities of this sordid group, but even hidden in their own beguiling statements. Former Presidents George and Bill had a little insider fun with the press, joking about their close brotherhood at a high - priced media event in Toronto, Canada held on Friday, May 29, 2009: Former US President George W. Bush says ex - President William J. Clinton never criticized him as both leaders followed similar policies in t heir tenures... The two leaders rubberstamped each other's policies, agreeing that little differences existed between the two... Bush supported Clinton's silence during the 1994 Rwanda genocide in which over 800,000 thousands Tutsis and moderate Hutus were s laughtered. He backed Clinton's notion by admitting that the quick mobilization of 20,000 troops was not feasible at the time... Clinton, for his part, praised Bush for his 'diverse' cabinet picks... Tickets for \"A conversation with Presidents George W. Bush a nd Bill Clinton,\" were sold for C$200 to C$2,500 as hundreds of opposition had staged a rally outside the heavily guarded venue. Commenting on the financial benefits of the forum, Bush said, \"President Clinton and I used to believe in free speech... So tha nks very much for coming - we are glad you're here.\" He also called Clinton a 'brother' for the amount of time he spent with the Bush family... 27 "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 76 George calling Bill his brother may prove to be one of his few accurate claims. Not only are Clinton and George W. both cult members of the Skull & Bones ‘Brotherhood’, they are also both direct descendents of the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds! Playing with the double meaning of words like ‘brother’ creates a plausible deniability that the global crime family enj oys in public. Another famous ‘insider joke’ that Bush Jr. often plays with media involves flashing the satanic horns hand sign under the guise of supporting a sports team from Texas. While the intentions behind the hand signals of George W. will remain ob scured, the genetic relationship between George and ‘brother’ Bill will certainly become public knowledge , revealing the perverse truths behind their sick insider jokes. The genetic information retrieved and published by Dr. Arrigo, at great personal ris k, will no doubt form the beginning of a more lengthy genetic study of this psychopathic ‘bloodline’ to its roots in the Ashkenazi ancestral lineage of the Khazars, a Caucasian sect of Jews. 28 One may not find it surprising that the families promoting Aryan eugenics are themselves examples of a genetic line with an inherited neurological deficiency – psychopathy – who must be removed from decision - making positions in society. The attempt of psychopathic human beings to institutionalize psychopathy in the rest of humanity cannot proceed unchecked. Neurological deficiency resulting in psychopathic behavior has governed humanity for millennia. Technological advances can relieve this disturbing influence on human development. Brain scanning during empathy tests ca n be applied to uproot psychopathy in human leadership, while scientific investigations of rebirth may also enable the recognition of advanced capabilities among us. Likewise, t he teaching of karma and reincarnation can be scientifically applied to recreat e our world in that powerful circular awareness, allowing future generations to be free of the psychopathy that has come to dominate world politics and international relations by subversion. Individuals presently entrapped in cycles of slavery and torture may be reborn into a healthy infrasound environment where group telepathy prevents hidden abuse, and the great potential of all reincarnating souls may illuminate the collective human experience. The present shift of the Ages signals the return to the lif e path that the prime Creator has set out for humanity, with our bare feet in contact with the Earth in conscious awareness of the underlying unity of all Creation. The quantum physics of resonance and the indigenous ancient wisdom now seamlessly inform hu manity of the unfolding planetary shift to a four - dimensional resonance currently bleeding through in a pattern of widening focal points that already require evacuation. Piezoelectric firestorms caused by infrasound are destroying all modern metal machiner y in resonant focal areas and at high altitudes, proving all nuclear facilities, warhead stockpiles, satellites and space stations to be ill - equipped to handle the surging planetary infrasound levels. The specific and crucial warnings of spiritual scient ists and indigenous Elders must be heeded if humanity is to emerge safely from the present threat of global catastrophe. The American people and indeed the whole world must inform themselves of the lethal dangers of high - frequency radiation and the current ly available resonant health technologies based on ayurvedic pyramids and the human heartbeat. Water purification and treatment with gold and silver colloids must be put to the immediate use of all of humanity, including both the free energy and curative a pplications of HHO plasma. The quadratic function [ z n+1 = z n 2 modulus n] is the universal key to unlimited cosmic energy for the relief of all human suffering.

All of the world’s religions have rebuilt themselves using differing interpretations of what on ce occurred at these resonant sites, quarreling over divergent terminology. Indeed, it was the strict control of these entrances that has been enforced through religious possession of the sites and the manner of their use. The bioelectric and consciousness enhancing effects of focused infrasound at these sacred sites are, in fact, achieved through resonant architecture using piezoelectric stone in the proper alignment with the precise standing wave pattern projected by the Giza pyramids, expressed as [ z n+1 = z n 2 modulus n].

The human enlightenment is already occurring among our children, who are now developing advanced capacities and accessing memories of their prior lifetimes, signaling a broader awareness than has been accessible to previous generations. Spiritual sensitivity is now ambiently endowed by high - amplitude infrasound during a child’s development. Ayurvedic wisdom teaches that gold and silver nanoparticles enhance vitality in all life forms by elimin ating only pathogenic organisms like viri and bacteria in atmospheric and cellular environments, thereby acting as agents of global atmospheric purification and transformation. The optimal conditions for fetal development are achieved by water birthing in electrum colloids in the presence of a healthy 1.45 Hz heartbeat resonance. The resulting physiological changes include a subtle occipital enlargement of the cranium that reflects a broadening bandwidth of perception, imbuing sensitivity into the infrared and ultraviolet portions of the spectrum. The deepening Earth resonance and strengthening magnetic field allow for the reincarnation of advanced spirits among our emerging generations.
